  "text": "<p>   Foreign students from China, Brazil, Iran and South Africa will be exempt from the remaining travel bans imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, opening up the possibility of a significant rebound in international-student enrollment at U.S. schools this fall. </p><p>   The U.S. State Department said in an update online, dated Monday, that students and academics, as well as journalists and a few other categories of individuals from those countries, will be allowed into the U.S. with proper visas. </p><p>   Last summer, the Trump administration made similar exceptions for students and others from the U.K., Ireland and Europe. The carve-outs are made under what the State Department calls a \"national interest exemption,\" meaning the government has determined it's in the U.S.'s best interest to allow these individuals in. </p><p>   U.S. embassies and consulates have resumed visa services across much of the world after suspending operations in March 2020. They say they are prioritizing family members of U.S. citizens, diplomats and those assisting with the pandemic response, followed by students and some other groups. </p><p>   International enrollment at American colleges and universities plummeted last fall, as hundreds of thousands of students were stranded overseas, unable to secure new visas or unable to travel. Visa records show the number of students here on F-1 or M-1 visas, which include those at colleges, vocational programs and K-12 schools, fell 18% to 1.25 million, while visa records for newly enrolled students tumbled 72%. </p><p>   Chinese students account for roughly one-third of international students enrolled at U.S. schools. Students from India, the second-leading country of origin, are subject to standard Covid-19 testing protocols but haven't been restricted from travel to the U.S. during the pandemic. Brazil is ninth-largest, and Iran No. 13, according to the Institute of International Education, which supports global study and tracks international enrollments. Uncertainty over visa issuance and travel weighed on schools this spring, as they tried to plan for the coming school year. </p><p></p>",
