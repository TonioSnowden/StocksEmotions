  "title": "U.S. News: White House Opts to Allow Work-Visa Ban to Expire",
  "text": "<p>The White House declined to comment on the expiration.</p><p>The decision to let the ban expire will benefit a range of companies, from technology to landscaping, that say there aren't American workers who can fill their specific needs. Tech companies left jobs unfilled or hired preferred employees to work remotely from abroad. Seasonal employers, including landscapers, resort owners and summer camps, use other visa types covered by the ban to employ foreign workers for their busy seasons, and families use them to hire au pairs.</p><p>Even with the ban lifted, immigration experts say it will be tough for many of the blocked workers to come to the U.S., since pandemic travel restrictions remain in effect for most of Europe, Brazil, China, Iran and South Africa, and consulates in those countries for the most part won't issue visas. Consulates in countries without blanket travel bans are still operating at reduced capacity, and in those cases, the State Department has instructed them to give priority to green cards over work visas.</p><p>\"Visa processing won't pick up as quickly as everyone will want,\" said Sharvari Dalal-Dheini,director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p><p>Labor unions, some of Mr. Biden's most ardent allies, have in the past taken issue with some of the same work-based visas targeted by the ban.</p><p>Immigration hard-liners who favor the more aggressive policy approach taken by the Trump administration criticized the decision to let the ban expire, saying it would hamper economic recovery.</p><p>\"President Biden often portrays himself as a man from the 'working class' who is a tireless defender of the American worker, yet his administration does the opposite with immigration policy,\" said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation of American Immigration Reform, a group that favors limiting legal immigration.</p>",
