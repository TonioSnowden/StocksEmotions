  "title": "Stocks Close Lower After Target, Lowe's Earnings; Visa shares fall on Amazon concerns, while Target's revenue and earnings top expectations",
  "text": "<p>Visa Inc. shares fell 4.7%, or $10.12, to $205.06 after Amazon.com Inc. said it would stop accepting Visa's U.K. credit cards because of their high fees. The move marks a major escalation in the e-commerce giant's yearslong battle with the card network.</p><p>A strong earnings season had propelled stocks to fresh highs in recent weeks, with investors shaking off concerns that supply-chain issues might weigh on profits or that higher prices might keep people from spending. Lowe's shares added 0.4%, or $0.95, to $245.73 after the company boosted its full-year sales guidance. TJX gained 5.8%, or $4.05, to $73.55 after the retailer posted earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations.</p><p>But the market momentum has cooled over the past week, after news that U.S. inflation is at a three-decade high. Target shares fell 4.7%, or $12.59, to $253.80 even though the retailer posted revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations.</p><p>The coming year likely won't get the same benefits that 2021 did, such as stimulus checks and bounceback from the Covid-19 pandemic's lows, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>\"Don't get too comfortable in the fast lane,\" Ms. Roland said this week. \"Next year, we just don't see the highest-risk parts of the market leading, and we're actually looking to trim risk into spring.\"</p><p>Still, a dip in retail stocks could be a buying opportunity, said Andrew Slimmon, head of the applied equity advisers team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.</p><p>\"If a company beats estimates, but the stock drops, I would not run out and sell those stocks,\" Mr. Slimmon said. \"Stocks don't go down for long when companies are doing better than expected.\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 1.604% Wednesday, down from 1.632% Tuesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Shares of Tesla rose 3.3%, or $34.28, to $1,089.01. Chief Executive Elon Musk sold another 934,000 shares Tuesday for roughly $973 million, continuing a recent selling spree, according to regulatory filings.</p><p>Fresh data showed that housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, declined 0.7% in October from September. Home builders are contending with rising material costs and labor shortages, which are driving up home prices.</p><p>Morgan Stanley's Mr. Slimmon said he is betting on housing stocks as he expects supply issues to ease next year.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 stock index rose 0.1%, hitting a new record that reflects gains for six consecutive trading days. In Asia, major stock indexes closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 shed 0.4%. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.4%.</p><p>Brent crude futures, the global oil market benchmark, lost $2.15 per barrel, or 2.6%, to $80.28, the lowest settle value since Oct. 1.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Lower After Target, Lowe's Earnings</p>",
