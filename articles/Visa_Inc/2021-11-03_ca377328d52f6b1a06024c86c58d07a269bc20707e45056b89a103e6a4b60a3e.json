Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will follow with a press conference at 2:30 p.m. Here's what to watch.</p><p>Negative Bond Yields Recede in Europe</p><p>Negative bond yields are getting harder to find in Europe, shrinking the pool of debt that pays back less to investors than they put in.

Today, China is buying more gas from the U.S. than ever, a consequence of the global energy shortage and China's effort to reduce how much coal it burns.</p><p>Visa Restrictions Endanger U.S. Innovation Edge, Universities Say</p><p>American universities and research institutes say the U.S.'s dominance in science and technology could be undermined by toughened U.S. visa requirements that are squeezing the flow of talent from China.</p><p>Financial Regulation Roundup</p><p>Biden Picks Wall Street Critic to Oversee Large Banks</p><p>The Biden administration formally nominated Saule Omarova, a law professor and critic of big banks, to serve as a top banking regulator, a setback for Wall Street and other firms that had pushed to scuttle her nomination.</p><p>SEC Chairman Says Crypto Market Won't Mature Without Oversight</p><p>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said the regulator will be \"very active\" in bringing the digital currency market under its investor protection framework, as the Biden administration increases scrutiny of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Bond Investors Challenge Wall Street Greenwashing</p><p>As financial regulators in the U.S. and Europe scrutinize the investment industry for signs of misleading claims, or \"greenwashing,\" some money managers are blackballing green bonds they say have loopholes for borrowers.</p><p>Barclays Sheds Jeffrey Epstein Ties, Keeps Wall Street Strategy</p><p>Jes Staley may be gone from Barclays, but C.S.

The new rule, which will take effect at the start of 2022, will also crack down on practices that made hospitals' prices hard to find and access, including the use of special coding embedded in hospital webpages that prevents Google and other search engines from displaying price pages in search results.</p><p>Forward Guidance</p><p>Wednesday (all times ET)</p><p>8:30 a.m.: U.S. Commerce Department releases September international trade data</p><p>9 a.m.: Bank of Canada's Gravelle speaks on panel on climate risk management via videoconference</p><p>2 p.m.: U.S. Federal Reserve releases policy statement</p><p>2:30 p.m.: Fed's Powell holds press conference</p><p>Thursday</p><p>5 a.m.: Norges Bank releases interest-rate decision</p><p>8 a.m.: Bank of England releases monetary policy report, summary and minutes; European Central Bank's Lagarde gives speech at ECB-Center for Economic and Policy Research Women in Economics Conference</p><p>9:30 a.m.: Czech National Bank releases monetary policy decision</p><p>1:50 p.m.: Fed's Quarles speaks on panel on financial stability at Portuguese Securities Market Commission conference</p><p>2:50 p.m.: European Central Bank's Schnabel speaks on panel at ECB-Center for Economic and Policy Research Women in Economics Conference</p><p>Research</p><p>Climate Risk Disclosure by Large Banks Still Weak</p><p>Although some improvement has been seen over the past 18 months, climate risk disclosure by large banks of how climate change might affect their financial performance \"remains weak,\" Moody's Investors Service says. A review of 28 U.S., European and Asian lenders with combined assets of $56 trillion showed \"most banks focus on disclosing governance structures, policies, and processes to manage environmental risk rather than providing a clear assessment of how climate change might affect their lending and investment portfolios,\" Moody's adds. It also says that banks \"have mostly improved disclosure on their own carbon footprint, which is less material to their credit strength than their indirect climate exposures.\"</p><p>—Stephen Nakrosis</p><p>Commentary</p><p>Worker Shortage Could Bring Back Stagflation</p><p>When 10 million jobs remain unfilled and 51% of small-business owners say they can't fill open positions, public policy needs to focus on expanding the labor force and filling job openings, Sen.
