  "text": "<p>Soldiers are also going just outside the airport perimeter, which is surrounded by Taliban fighters, to disperse crowds and clear the way for families struggling to get in, videos clips taken by passengers show.</p><p>Thousands of Afghans are pushing to get into the airport, following the Taliban's takeover of Kabul on Sunday. North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and partners have evacuated nearly 20,000 people from Kabul airport since last weekend, according to public announcements by officials.</p><p>To reach the airport, Afghans and foreigners have to get past Taliban checkpoints, where Taliban fighters have been firing in the air and using violence to hold back crowds.</p><p>The three entry gates to the airport remain blocked with people pushing to get inside. To allow families, including women and children, into the airport, security forces are using tear gas and firing into the air to disperse the crowd, Western officials said.</p><p>Tear gas was used Thursday and Friday at the airport, according to people who have accessed the airport, and officials.</p><p>One Afghan man who has worked for a U.S. contractor and who has an approved Special Immigrant Visa for the U.S. said he arrived at the airport on Thursday and attempted all night to enter. His family carried their children on their shoulders to prevent them from being crushed. However, he failed and gave up Friday morning, returning home exhausted.</p><p>\"We were stuck between the aggression of the Taliban and U.S. forces in the gate,\" said the man. \"I don't know if I will ever be able to get out.\"</p><p>Many people trying to reach flights don't have the required documents. One had only his household electricity bill, the man said.</p><p>\"The limiting factor is not the planes,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference Friday. \"The paradox is that we have more planes than people or passengers. Getting people, especially Afghans, into the airport is the big challenge.\"</p><p>In addition to the thousands of American troops at the airport, including Marines, there are British soldiers and soldiers from Afghan security forces who didn't surrender to the Taliban and who are also providing security in cooperation with international troops. These Afghans are members of CIA-trained units and will also be put on planes as the extraction operation ends, Western officials said.</p><p>Some Afghans, including members of the country's Shiite Hazara minority, complained that the Afghan soldiers have harassed them and turned them away as they seek entry to the airport.</p><p>Amnesty International said that it had documented the killing of nine ethnic Hazara men as the Taliban swept into their province, Ghazni, south of Kabul.</p><p>A senior British official said Friday morning that the government was speeding up evacuations and had flown 963 people from Kabul in the past 24 hours.</p><p>Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said that he understood that the Taliban weren't turning people away from the airport.</p><p>\"Where they have done that, I've heard that it's more that they are being officious rather than malicious,\" he said. People called for flights should have confidence that the Taliban would let them through, he said.</p><p>Mr. Heappey said he couldn't put a time frame on how long the Royal Air Force's evacuation operation would last.</p><p>\"Eventually the air bridge will have to close and quite possibly not everybody will have been got out. That's what keeps us awake at night. That's what's motivating to us to work as hard as we are to ensure that those numbers are the absolute minimum,\" he said.</p><p>Qatar said its armed forces were evacuating hundreds of Afghan civilians, including members of a girls' robotics team.</p><p>Pakistan has taken out 1,100 people on special flights of its national carrier since Tuesday, Pakistani officials said, with 350 people due to depart on Friday.</p><p>France has sent three transport planes to Kabul that have airlifted around 500 people out of the country. Paris has also deployed special forces in Afghanistan to escort people to the airport. Those operations rely on cooperation with U.S. authorities that control the airport, a French official said. \"It's not a question of willingness for us, but of feasibility,\" the official said.</p><p>A German civilian was shot in unclear circumstances while traveling to the Kabul airport, German officials said Friday. The man was treated for wounds that weren't life-threatening, and would be evacuated, officials said.</p><p>Getting people through the city of Kabul, past Taliban checkpoints, and inside the gates of the airport has been immensely difficult, German military officials said.</p><p>Germany is sending two small transport helicopters to Kabul to assist in extracting people from within the city to the airport, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told reporters Friday. The helicopters are designed for extraction in tight spaces and are expected to be operational in Kabul on Saturday.</p><p>The deployment of the German military helicopters won't be restricted to extracting German nationals or Afghan civilians, Mrs. Kramp-Karrenbauer said. The helicopters will be armed and fly with support from larger U.S. machines too big to land in the city.</p><p>\"This is not a taxi service,\" German Inspector General Eberhard Zorn told reporters.</p><p>At Taliban checkpoints, fighters are searching for certain individuals from the ousted government, a report from the Norwegian Center for Global Analyses said. The Taliban are going house to house in Kabul, hunting down people associated with the former government of President Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan leader who fled the country on Sunday.</p><p>Before taking Kabul and other major cities, the group assembled a target list of individuals, which has now been augmented.</p><p>\"Taliban are rapidly recruiting new informer networks eager to collaborate with the new regime,\" the report said.</p><p>German broadcaster Deutsche Welle said that Taliban fighters have gone looking for its journalists in their homes. Failing to find one of them, they shot dead one family member and seriously injured another, it said.</p><p>Meanwhile, it emerged that one of the people who died after clinging to a U.S. military plane earlier this week was Zaki Anwari, a teenager who played for Afghanistan's national youth football team, said family friends and footballing organizations. Several people died after losing their grip as the plane took off. Human remains were also found in the landing gear after it touched down in the Gulf, the U.S. military said.</p><p>Ehsanullah Amiri, Bill Boston, James Marson and Ava Sasani contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.com</p><p>Afghan Crowds Fleeing Taliban Face Tear Gas at Kabul Airport</p>",
