  "title": "Biden to Push for Help on Migration at Summit of the Americas; U.S. officials hope to cement cooperation on key issues, even as Mexico's president and some other leaders boycott the gathering",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Biden will host the Summit of the Americas—which is focused on economic, climate and migration issues—for three days. He is expected to lay out an economic-recovery agenda in the aftermath of the pandemic that will include mobilizing investments in the region, making supply chains more resilient and pushing for more clean-energy jobs and more-inclusive trade relations between the countries, a senior administration official said. He is also expected to announce more than $300 million in assistance to address food insecurity in the region and propose changes to the Inter-American Development Bank.</p><p>In the days leading up to the summit, controversy over the guest list overshadowed the administration's policy agenda. The Biden administration said Monday it would exclude Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela due to U.S. concerns over human rights and lack of democratic institutions in those countries, prompting some leaders in the region to back out.</p><p>Mr. López Obrador confirmed Monday he wouldn't attend and is instead sending his foreign minister. The Mexican leader is expected to visit the White House in July, administration officials said. The leaders of Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras and St. Vincent and the Grenadines also said they wouldn't attend. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had threatened not to go, but later opted in.</p><p>Administration officials have played down the impact of the boycotts, stressing that many of the absent government leaders are still sending delegations. The officials have also said that strengthening democratic institutions in the region has been a goal of previous summits. After the 2001 summit in Quebec, countries signed the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which created the basis for agreeing to exclude nondemocracies from regional summits.</p><p>Michael Shifter, former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group that works on Western Hemisphere affairs, said the administration can try to salvage the summit without key leaders there, but it should have done more ahead of time to make sure they would attend.</p><p>\"It's a setback for the U.S. as hosts of the summit,\" Mr. Shifter said. \"There were signs that this was building and signs that there was discontent with Washington, and I don't think there was a good reading of that.\"</p><p>This year's gathering will convene as thousands of migrants stuck at Mexico's border with Guatemala left in a large caravan heading north as part of a protest calling on Mexico's government to issue humanitarian visas allowing migrants to move freely across Mexico. Most of the migrants are Cubans and Venezuelans who were in the Mexican border town of Tapachula waiting for their visas to be issued so they could leave town.</p><p>Mr. Biden has struggled to handle a surge in migrants at the southern border since he took office. In March, U.S. border authorities apprehended nearly 210,000 migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the highest monthly tally since 2000, and they arrested nearly 202,000 migrants in April.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>To what extent will the Summit of the Americas help to strengthen ties in the region? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The administration plans to sign on Friday a joint declaration with the summit's other participating countries that will for the first time commit more countries to host migrants moving across the region. There are currently six million displaced Venezuelans living in countries from Colombia to Ecuador and the U.S., as well as hundreds of thousands of Central American, Haitian and Cuban migrants on the move.</p><p>Summit participants are expected to agree to a framework in which more countries would host migrants and create more visa pathways to move throughout the region legally for either work or humanitarian protection, say people familiar with the matter. In exchange, Mr. Biden would boost the U.S.'s economic commitment to countries with large migrant populations.</p><p>\"He has mobilized leaders around a whole new plan that is centered on responsibility-sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugee and migration flows,\" a senior administration official said.</p><p>Republicans, who have bashed Mr. Biden for months over his handling of immigration, have pointed to the new caravan in recent days and called on the administration to do more. \"The border is out of control,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.). \"I think voters understand it's unsustainable, and if they weren't so overwhelmed by the disaster in the economy, that would be at the top of the list,\" he added, pointing to rising inflation and gas prices.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, tasked by Mr. Biden with addressing root causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, announced Tuesday nearly $2 billion in private-sector investments to those three countries, bringing the total amount in pledges over the past year to $3.2 billion. Clothing manufacturer Gap Inc. and card network Visa Inc. were among those that vowed new investment.</p><p>Democratic and Republican administrations have struggled for long-term solutions to surges in migrants from Central America, many of whom say they are driven by poverty and violence in their home countries. Biden administration officials have said the aim in part is for greater private-sector involvement to outlast shifts in policy and government aid between administrations, reducing over time the motivations for migrants to make the often dangerous journey to the U.S. border.</p><p>Michelle Hackman and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com</p><p>Biden to Push for Help on Migration at Summit of the Americas</p>",
