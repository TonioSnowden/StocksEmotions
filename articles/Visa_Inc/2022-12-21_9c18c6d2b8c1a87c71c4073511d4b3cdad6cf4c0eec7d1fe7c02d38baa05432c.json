  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers unveiled Tuesday a wide-ranging, $1.65 trillion spending bill for fiscal 2023 with sharp increases in military and domestic funding, kicking off a sprint to pass the measure before Christmas in the last act of the Democratic-controlled Congress. </p><p>   The bill, the product of months of behind-the-scenes haggling, also carries an additional $45 billion in aid to help Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, $40.6 billion for disasters such as drought and hurricanes, as well as funds earmarked for projects in lawmakers' home districts. It includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, widens a ban on TikTok on government devices and extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. </p><p>   The bill includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than President Biden had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. Senate negotiators said it also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion from the prior year. The overall discretionary price tag works out to about $1.65 trillion, compared with $1.5 trillion the prior fiscal year. </p><p>   Congress must pass the spending package through both chambers before the expiration of an interim funding bill that runs through Friday. Because of the delays built into the Senate's process, quick enactment will depend on whether all 100 senators can agree to forgo debate time and proceed to a final vote. The Senate is expected to vote first, followed by the House, where leaders have told lawmakers to expect a vote late Wednesday at the earliest. </p><p>   The bill will require support of at least 10 Republicans in the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation to advance. In a first procedural step Tuesday evening, the Senate voted 70-25 to proceed to the bill. Many House Republicans have urged their Senate colleagues to reject the package and push talks into next year, when the GOP will control the House. But Republican senators have largely coalesced behind the plan. </p><p>   \"Under no circumstances are we going to go over the shutdown deadline\" in the Senate, said Republican Mike Lee of Utah. He was among a small group of Senate Republicans who grumbled over the length of the bill and the short time they had been given to review it -- though they said they wouldn't try to delay its passage, beyond requesting amendment votes. </p><p>   \"After a lot of hard work, this package represents an aggressive and essential investment in American families, American workers, and in our national defense,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). </p><p>   The Biden administration said it supports the legislation and urged quick passage. </p><p>   Senate Republicans said that the increases in military spending represented GOP victories, claiming that the deal broke a yearslong bargain to ensure parity between increases in defense and nondefense spending. That is because inflation as measured by the consumer-price index is up 7.1% from a year earlier, and while the defense-spending increase exceeded that level, the nondefense discretionary spending increase fell short of the inflation rate. </p><p>   \"A big real-dollar increase for the defense baseline, and a big real-dollar cut for the non-defense, non-veterans baseline,\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). \"This is an impressive outcome for the Republican negotiators, and more importantly, it is the outcome that our country needs.\" </p><p>   In the House, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is leading the opposition as he seeks to cajole members to support his bid to be elected House speaker next year. But the bill can pass the House with only Democratic votes. </p><p>   The bill incorporates the Senate's version of the Electoral Count Reform Act, bipartisan legislation that overhauls an 1887 law governing how Congress counts and ratifies presidential elector votes. The bill was written in response to efforts by Republican former President Donald Trump and his supporters to try to overturn his 2020 election loss. It would make clear that Congress's role in ratifying states' Electoral College votes is ministerial only and that the vice president's role is limited to counting the votes publicly. </p><p>   It would dramatically raise the threshold to sustain an objection to a state's electors from one House member and one senator to 1/5th of both chambers, prevent state legislatures from overriding the popular vote in their states by declaring a \"failed election,\" and establish a fast-tracked judicial review of disputes related to states' elector certificates, including a three-judge panel with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. </p><p>   A bipartisan bill that would expand incentives for retirement savings also made it into the package. The legislation would raise the starting age for required minimum distributions from tax-deferred accounts, encourage enrollment in retirement plans and expand savings incentives for low-income households. It also includes new limits on aggressive tax deals known as syndicated conservation easements. </p><p>   The bill hands wins to retiring members like Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), who teamed with Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) to win inclusion of the Prevent Pandemics Act, designed to improve the gathering of public-health data, the reliability of the national stockpile system, and subject the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Senate confirmation. It also includes parochial victories, like one for Maine's lobster industry, which secured the delay of stricter regulations protecting the tiny population of North Atlantic right whales. </p><p>   Left out of the package were several initiatives pushed by lawmakers outside the spending negotiations. The bill didn't expand the child tax credit for low-income families, as some Democrats wanted, or reinstate the immediate deduction of research costs incurred by businesses. </p><p>   Some lawmakers had pushed for a broad measure to grant green cards to Afghan refugees in the U.S. following the fall of Kabul in 2021. The omnibus bill instead continues a narrower program called the Special Immigrant Visa program that offers green cards to some Afghans who worked for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. </p><p>   The spending package kept annual funding for the Internal Revenue Service essentially flat, removing annual funding for technology improvements and forcing the agency to cover higher salaries and other inflationary increases within the same nominal dollar amount in its main divisions. </p><p>   Democrats highlighted the inclusion of $5 billion in mandatory funding for a toxic-exposures fund to cover healthcare for about two-dozen health conditions that the Department of Veterans Affairs now considers automatically related to military service. </p><p></p>",
