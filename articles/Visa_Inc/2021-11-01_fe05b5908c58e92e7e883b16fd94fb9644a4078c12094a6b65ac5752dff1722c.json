Levy. It has already risen dramatically, and it is suppressing real wages. Expectations of further inflation have begun to influence wage demands, costs of production, supply-chain estimates, and business pricing strategies. Lower-income earners are being squeezed the most. It isn't enough that the Fed says it will begin tapering its asset purchases, while it continues to hope that inflation will recede to 2% when supply shortages dissipate. The Fed must acknowledge that its monetary policy has been a source of inflation, and that it will need to raise interest rates more quickly than it presumed.</p><p>Mr. Levy is senior economist at Berenberg Capital Markets and a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee.</p><p>Forward Guidance</p><p>Monday (all times ET)</p><p>7:50 p.m.: Bank of Japan releases Sept. 21-22 meeting minutes</p><p>11:30 p.m.: Reserve Bank of Australia releases policy statement</p><p>Tuesday</p><p>Time N/A: U.S. Federal Reserve begins two-day policy meeting</p><p>3:20 a.m.: European Central Bank's Enria gives speech on banking sector resilience at Finnish Supervisory Authority EU financial markets conference</p><p>Basis Points</p><p>The U.S. and the European Union have reached a deal to ease U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that date to former President Donald Trump, levies that were a longstanding irritant to European leaders.</p><p>Consumer sentiment in the U.S. rose slightly in late October but stayed at low levels over the month, signaling Americans' mood remains dim amid persisting supply-chain bottlenecks and high inflation.

(Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>Services activity in the central U.S. continued to grow in October despite widespread supply-chain issues, while expectations for future activity slipped but remained positive, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Its Tenth District Services Survey's composite index came in at 18 for the month, up from 13 in September and 14 in August.
