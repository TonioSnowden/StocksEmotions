  "text": "<p>The deal to renew the program was included in must-pass annual spending legislation that Democratic leaders are hoping to pass by the end of the week.</p><p>It represents a compromise between two factions that have long fought over the program's structure. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa.) and Pat Leahy (D., Vt.) advocated adding stricter rules to prevent fraud and steer funding to rural areas, while real estate groups and some lawmakers from states such as New York want to make it easier for property developers in big cities to raise EB-5 money.</p><p>Messrs. Grassley and Leahy fought for their desired changes for nearly a decade, but it took the program's lapse -- and accompanying threats from investor-visa applicants to sue -- for the real-estate industry and its representatives to agree to them.</p><p>Under the terms of the deal, foreign investors would need to put at least $1,050,000 into an investment project to qualify for a green card, or $800,000 in an area of high unemployment. That represents an increase over the current rules, which require a $500,000 investment in a high-unemployment area.</p><p>The EB-5 program emerged as a popular source of cheap funding for real-estate developers in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. Because investors get a green card, they are often willing to accept lower interest rates.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
