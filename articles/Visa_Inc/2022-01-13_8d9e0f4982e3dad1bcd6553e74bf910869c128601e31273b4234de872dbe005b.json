  "title": "Novak Djokovic Set to Play Fellow Serb in Australian Open as Visa Decision Looms; No. 1-ranked men's tennis player waits to hear whether immigration minister will cancel his visa",
  "text": "<p>A day earlier, Djokovic said his agent made an error on a travel declaration used to enter Australia last week. He also said he attended an interview and photo shoot in Belgrade, Serbia, last month after receiving a positive test result for Covid-19.</p><p>\"These are personal ministerial powers able to be exercised by Minister Hawke and I don't propose to make any further comment at this time,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a Thursday news conference in Canberra. He did, however, reiterate his stance that unvaccinated non-Australians trying to enter the country had to provide acceptable proof they can't have Covid-19 shots for medical reasons.</p><p>The government had canceled Djokovic's visa shortly after his arrival at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport, although it was reinstated by a judge on Monday because immigration authorities didn't give the tennis champion enough time to respond to notice of the visa cancellation.</p><p>His views on vaccination have made him a lightning rod in the debate over Covid-19 vaccine mandates as Australia, which has had relative success in stamping out outbreaks of the virus for much of the pandemic, grapples with surging infections.</p><p>Djokovic's case has especially prompted outrage in Victoria state, home to Melbourne, which has spent much of the past 21 months under strict lockdown.</p><p>Sports psychologist Stephen Cobley said Djokovic's exercise and nutritional routines would have been disrupted by his four days of detention in a Melbourne hotel reserved for asylum seekers and refugees. But it is possible hostility from tennis fans could fuel his performance should he compete at the Australian Open, he said.</p><p>\"If he has the skill and he has the ability to adapt, he will use that resistance and that raucous response to his advantage,\" said Cobley, an associate professor at the University of Sydney. \"He will actually welcome it.\"</p><p>Djokovic has never received the widespread adulation enjoyed by rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, and was jeered by the crowd when he beat Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final.</p><p>KecmanoviÄ‡, whom Djokovic is scheduled to play in the first round, is ranked No. 78 by the ATP.</p><p>The draw set up a potential semifinal meeting between Djokovic and Nadal, who also has 20 Grand Slam titles. Last week, Nadal said Djokovic, who is among the 3% of men's players the ATP says is unvaccinated against Covid-19, could have avoided any drama by getting vaccinated.</p><p>\"In some ways, I feel sorry for him. But he knew the conditions months ago. He made his own decision,\" Nadal said.</p><p>Many Australians and even some fellow tennis players are questioning why Djokovic was allowed to enter Australia without being fully vaccinated, after two years of strict border rules that kept many Australians from being able to return home and barred residents from visiting family and friends abroad.</p><p>With Covid-19 cases hitting fresh records in Australia, Victoria's government on Thursday limited the number of people allowed to attend the Australian Open. Ticket sales will be paused at 50% of capacity for sessions that haven't already hit that level, while face masks will be mandatory and density limits will be in place.</p><p>Top women's seed Ashleigh Barty was drawn to face a yet-to-be-known qualifier in the first round. The draw was briefly delayed, although Tennis Australia, which organizes the event, wasn't immediately available to comment on the holdup.</p><p>Write to Stuart Condie at stuart.condie@wsj.com</p><p>Novak Djokovic Set to Play Fellow Serb in Australian Open as Visa Decision Looms</p>",
