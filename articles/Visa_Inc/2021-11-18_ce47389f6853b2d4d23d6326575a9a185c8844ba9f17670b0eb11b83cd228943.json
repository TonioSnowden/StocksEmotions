  "title": "Stocks Fall After Earnings From Target, TJX, Lowe's --- Visa shares drop 4.7% on Amazon decision to stop accepting company's U.K. cards",
  "text": "<p>Visa Inc. shares fell 4.7%, or $10.12, to $205.06 after Amazon.com Inc. said it would stop accepting Visa's U.K. credit cards because of their high fees. The move marks an escalation in the e-commerce company's yearslong battle with the card network.</p><p>A strong earnings season had propelled stocks to records in recent weeks, with investors shaking off concerns that supply-chain issues might weigh on profits or that higher prices might keep people from spending.</p><p>Lowe's shares added 0.4%, or 95 cents, to $245.73 after the company boosted its full-year sales guidance. TJX gained 5.8%, or $4.05, to $73.55 after the retailer posted earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations.</p><p>Market momentum cooled over the past week after news that U.S. inflation is at a three-decade high. Target shares fell 4.7%, or $12.59, to $253.80 though the retailer posted revenue and earnings that topped expectations.</p><p>Next year likely won't get the same benefits that 2021 did, such as stimulus checks and bounceback from the Covid-19 pandemic's lows, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>\"Don't get too comfortable in the fast lane,\" Ms. Roland said. \"Next year, we just don't see the highest-risk parts of the market leading, and we're actually looking to trim risk into spring.\"</p><p>Still, a decline in retail stocks could be a buying opportunity, said Andrew Slimmon, head of the applied equity advisers team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"If a company beats estimates, but the stock drops, I would not run out and sell those stocks,\" Mr. Slimmon said. \"Stocks don't go down for long when companies are doing better than expected.\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 1.604%, down from 1.632% Tuesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Shares of Tesla rose 3.3%, or $34.28, to $1,089.01. Chief Executive Elon Musk sold an additional 934,000 shares Tuesday for roughly $973 million, continuing a recent selling spree, according to regulatory filings.</p><p>Fresh data showed that housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, declined 0.7% in October from September. Home builders are contending with rising material costs and labor shortages, which are driving up home prices.</p><p>Mr. Slimmon said he is betting on housing stocks as he expects supply issues to ease next year.</p><p>Brent crude futures, the global oil market benchmark, lost $2.15, or 2.6%, to $80.28 a barrel, the lowest settlement value since Oct. 1.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 stock index rose 0.1%, hitting a record that reflects gains for six consecutive trading days.</p><p>Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.5%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.1%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
