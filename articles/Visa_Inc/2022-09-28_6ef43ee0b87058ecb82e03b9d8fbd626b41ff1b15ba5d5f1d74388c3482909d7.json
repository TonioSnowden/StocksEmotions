  "title": "Visa stock set to snap record losing streak, but economic concerns linger; A strong dollar and economic pressures in Europe are among the headwinds for Visa and Mastercard, analysts say",
  "text": "<p>Both stocks looked on pace to extend their losing streaks during much of Wednesday morning's activities but started showing lasting gains around midday.</p><p>Visa and Mastercard have each held up marginally better than the broader market so far this year, with Visa shares down 17.2% and Mastercard shares off 19.2% to date in 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has lost 22.0%. The names have been seen as more insulated from inflation-related fears; executives from both companies indicated earlier in the year that their businesses historically had seen some benefits from inflation.</p><p>Read: 'Consumer spending has been remarkably stable,' Visa CFO says</p><p>The shares have lagged behind the broader market over a more recent span, however, with Visa down 11.7% over the past month and Mastercard down 12.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 has declined 8.6%. Fellow payments giant American Express Co. AXP has seen its stock fall 11.2% over that period.</p><p>Recent pressures on the big payments companies could reflect growing concerns about foreign-exchange headwinds, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis, who told MarketWatch that both Visa and Mastercard have more international exposure than the average U.S. company, with Mastercard's exposure a bit greater than Visa's.</p><p>For that reason, she said, \"the stronger dollar creates significant revenues and EPS [earnings per share] translation headwinds for the networks, which triggers negative revisions to nominal reported revenue and EPS, even if the underlying constant currency figures remain strong.\"</p><p>Visa and Mastercard each saw about 4 to 5 percentage points of negative headwinds related to foreign-exchange in their most recently reported quarters, and \"as the dollar strengthens, so does that headwind,\" Ellis said.</p><p>Both Visa and Mastercard have benefited from international travel that has resurged from pandemic lows — a trend that's helped their businesses, as it leads to lucrative cross-border revenues. But the strong dollar ultimately could weigh on cross-border travel, Ellis said, by discouraging overseas tourists from traveling to the U.S.</p><p>Mizuho analyst Ryan Coyne agreed that changing outlooks on cross-border trends could be at play. Visa and Mastercard shares became \"crowded post-COVID as investors were excited about the return of high-yielding cross-border travel volumes,\" he told MarketWatch. However, that trade \"may have played out, and thus we're beginning to see a reversal.\"</p><p>He noted that almost 30% of Mastercard's normalized payment volumes for calendar 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, came from Europe, compared with about 20% for Visa. Investors could have growing concerns about the exposure to the U.K. and Europe in general, he said.</p><p>Additionally, Visa's fiscal year ends in September, meaning that its management team is expected to deliver a forecast for fiscal 2023 in conjunction with the company's next earnings report in a month or so.</p><p>\"Given the weakening macro, investors may perceive additional risk here and thus favor [Mastercard to Visa] on a relative basis,\" Coyne said.</p><p>MoffettNathanson's Ellis nonetheless remained upbeat about the prospects for both Visa and Mastercard.</p><p>\"I view any pullback of this magnitude in [Visa and Mastercard] stocks as an attractive long-term entry point,\" she said, noting that the \"core\" thesis of roughly 11% volume growth, 12% to 13% revenue growth and 16% to 17% earnings growth \"is as strong as ever.\"</p><p>Additionally, \"the businesses are inflation-hedged and with their strong near-term cash flows aren't sensitive to rate hikes. … So aside from the foreign-exchange-related dynamics, which will weigh on the stocks in the near term, they are a great place to be.\"</p><p>Visa stock set to snap record losing streak, but economic concerns linger</p>",
