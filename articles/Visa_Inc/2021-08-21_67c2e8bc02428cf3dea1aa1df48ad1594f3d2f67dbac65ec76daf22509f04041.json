  "title": "The Afghanistan Crisis:  Tear Gas Used to Handle  Crowds at Kabul Airport  ---  Soldiers guarding the  perimeter fired guns  into air to clear path;  choppers sent to hotel  ----  By Saeed Shah and Gordon Lubold",
  "text": "<p>   The perimeter of Kabul's international airport remained a scene of teeming chaos Friday, with troops firing tear gas to control desperate crowds, while U.S. officials weighed dispatching forces to rescue Americans stuck beyond Taliban checkpoints and get them to the airport. </p><p>   Soldiers fired into the air and ventured beyond the perimeter, which is controlled by Taliban fighters, to disperse crowds and clear the way for families struggling to get in. U.S. troops, who took control of the airport this week, briefly left the perimeter via helicopters to rescue 169 Americans at a hotel, a Pentagon official said. </p><p>   In a televised address, President Biden said the U.S. had made progress in evacuating U.S. citizens and Afghan allies out of Kabul, but he warned the mission could result in losses. He vowed to evacuate any American who wanted to leave the country, and said the U.S. would also work to extract Afghan translators and other allies of the U.S., calling the mission dangerous. </p><p>   U.S. officials, in touch with Taliban leaders on the ground and in Doha, Qatar, have said the Taliban had agreed to permit U.S. citizens through their checkpoints to reach the airport. But Afghans, including holders of U.S. visas, have reportedly been blocked, harassed and beaten by militant fighters searching for individuals who worked for the U.S. government or foreign organizations or had been affiliated with the ousted government. </p><p>   British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said that he understood that the Taliban weren't turning people away from the airport. </p><p>   \"Where they have done that, I've heard that it's more that they are being officious rather than malicious,\" he said. People called for flights should have confidence that the Taliban would let them through, he said. </p><p>   Thousands of individuals who made it through Taliban checkpoints on Friday massed outside the airport, where the three entry gates remain blocked. </p><p>   It was unclear whether the soldiers who fired into the air were American; British and other Western troops are also stationed at the airport, as are a contingent of U.S.-trained Afghan troops who never surrendered to the Taliban and will be flown out as the evacuation operation winds down, Western officials said. </p><p>   The U.S. military didn't comment on the tear gas and firing but said that its job it to secure an outer perimeter at the airport. </p><p>   Some Afghans, including members of the country's Shiite Hazara minority, complained that the Afghan soldiers had harassed them and turned them away as they sought entry to the airport. </p><p>   One Afghan man who has worked for a U.S. contractor and who has an approved Special Immigrant Visa for the U.S. said he arrived at the airport on Thursday and attempted all night to enter. His family carried their children on their shoulders to prevent them from being crushed. However, he failed and gave up Friday morning, returning home exhausted. </p><p>   \"We were stuck between the aggression of the Taliban and U.S. forces in the gate,\" said the man. \"I don't know if I will ever be able to get out.\" </p><p>   Many people trying to reach flights don't have the required documents. One had only his household electricity bill, the man said. </p><p>   The U.S. military paused flights out of Kabul for several hours Friday because of backlogs processing passengers at their destinations and the limited number of consular officials on the ground at the Kabul airport, U.S. officials said. </p><p>   \"The limiting factor is not the planes,\" North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference. \"The paradox is that we have more planes than people or passengers. Getting people, especially Afghans, into the airport is the big challenge.\" </p><p>   Meanwhile, heavily armed British forces in bulletproof vehicles have been conducting \"gun runs\" into Kabul to collect British citizens and the Afghans who supported the British mission there to the airport safely, said a British official in Kabul. A senior British official said Friday morning that the government was speeding up evacuations and had flown 963 people from Kabul in the past 24 hours. </p><p>   Several other countries have undertaken operations to evacuate their citizens and Afghans. France has sent three transport planes to Kabul that have airlifted around 500 people out of the country. Paris has also deployed special forces to escort people to the airport. Germany is sending two helicopters to Kabul to assist in extracting people from within the city to the airport. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Andrew Restuccia, Ehsanullah Amiri, Bill Boston, James Marson and Ava Sasani contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
