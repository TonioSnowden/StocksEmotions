By contrast, scams related to flights increased only 13 per cent, but had a far higher average sum lost — close to £2,955 compared with £374. </p> <p>The incidence of false package holidays increased by 17 per cent and hotels 18 per cent, with an average cost to consumers of £2,342 and £1,231 respectively.</p> <p>Lloyds said that many of the scams took the form of fake advertisements on search engines or social media sites impersonating genuine firms. </p> <p>In some cases, fraudsters used real accommodation listing sites as a means of finding victims, then convinced them to transfer money directly to them rather than through official platforms. </p> <p>Travel is hardly the only industry which has been affected by fraud, as a pandemic-driven boom in time spent on online platforms has increased the number of potential avenues for fraudsters. </p> <p>Research in April by Visa and Aston University's Institute for Forensic Linguistics into the language of fraud found that a quarter of 18- to 34-year-olds in the UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db2e5cb7-63ed-4bd9-bdf1-f3ba448ee603\">would trust scam messages</a>, and the same proportion would not check for spelling and grammar mistakes.</p> <p>The latest figures on fraud released by the Office for National Statistics found 5.1mn offences in the year ending September 2021, a 36 per cent increase compared with the year ending September 2019.<br><br>The UK's online safety bill, which had its second reading in the House of Commons last week, would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5095d033-c17d-48cd-9670-b1a06500501c\">impose</a> a duty of care on social media platforms and search engines to protect their users from various kinds of user-generated and paid-for fraud, including romance and investment scams.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan 2022 'Scammers target travellers as holiday spending returns' FT.com 29 April.
