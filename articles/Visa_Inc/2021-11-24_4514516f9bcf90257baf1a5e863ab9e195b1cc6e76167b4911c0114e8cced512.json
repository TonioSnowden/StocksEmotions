  "text": "<p>FTSE 100 group <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> spelt out the cost of its U-turn on its battery business this morning, taking a £314m impairment charge in its half-year results after announcing two weeks ago that it would exit the business. </p> <p>The chemicals group had bet on battery materials for electric cars as a route to replace earnings from its catalytic converter business, which will decline as fossil fuel powered vehicles are phased out. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4d3dccc-44e9-42ae-af5b-f510605baa15\">earlier this month</a> it said that it could not compete with larger, lower cost producers. The division had £340m in assets.</p> <p>The impairment charge pushed Johnson Matthey's operating profit down to £20m for the six months to September, with a £9m pre-tax loss. The group also announced the sale of its specialist glass technologies business for £178m, and said it was in talks about the possible sale of its health business too. </p> <p>Chief executive Robert MacLeod, who leaves next year, nonetheless called trading “robust”, despite the group suffering from declining global car production, and facing falling precious metal prices and “acute temporary labour shortages in the US”. </p> <p>It also launched a £200m share buyback as underlying profits bounced back to £293m, double the pre-pandemic level, helped by a period of higher precious metal prices.</p> <p><strong>Lex</strong> wrote a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cd55db9-1deb-4d75-bf8d-da3a1cd4e19a\">very good note</a> on what Johnson Matthey should do next which is well worth a read if you haven't already. And I always enjoy hearing your thoughts on the business issues of the day (do email me at <a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a>) — but here's the view of Sir John Rose, former chief executive of Rolls-Royce, on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4135897-f00e-4661-9da2-38b10ed454f6\">company's predicament</a>.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Sales at handbag maker <strong>Mulberry</strong> rose by more than a third in the first half of its financial year, helping it return to profit (though more than half of its £10.2m pre-tax profit did come from the sale of its Paris lease). </p> <p>Even wealth manager <strong>Brewin Dolphin </strong>is not immune to the pressures of wage inflation, it seems. It cited employee pay as one of the reasons operating costs will grow by “mid to high single-digit per cent” in its 2022 financial year (alongside tech projects), while commission income is expected to hold steady at the rate set in the final quarter of the 2021 financial year. It reported net inflows of £1.9bn for the year to September, with total income up 12 per cent to £406m and pre-tax profits up 16 per cent to £73m thanks to “strong investment performance” as well as the inflows.</p> <p><strong>United Utilities</strong> published its half-year results this morning, though you have to wade through 17 bullet points of corporate guff before getting to any hard numbers. Underlying operating profits edged 4 per cent higher at the water group. </p> <p>Former prime minister <strong>David Cameron</strong> lobbied <strong>Lloyds Bank</strong> to reverse a decision to cut ties with the ailing <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, appealing to a board member whom he had ennobled while prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a71460b3-7023-40b7-aab0-469228b7e517\">our correspondents report</a>. Lloyds wanted to stop doing business with Greensill months before its collapse in March. But after Cameron's plea to former Conservative party treasurer Lord James Lupton, the bank reconsidered.</p> <p>London has its first <strong>Spac </strong>since the government overhauled rules on blank cheque companies in August. <strong>Hambro Perks</strong>, the venture capital firm, said yesterday that it would seek to raise up to £150m for an acquisition vehicle through listing in London, and then use the Spac to merge with a fast-growing European tech business within 15 months. Daniel Thomas has the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c3de8fa-2c9f-4748-9199-616fb3af83d1\">full story</a>.</p> <p>And <strong>Blue Prism</strong> shareholders will get the chance to vote on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43bebb35-e616-4bff-801d-9f4396ece5d6\">takeover offer </a>from private equity group Vista next month, despite there being a potential rival offer on the table from SS&amp;C Technologies. The Takeover Panel will now set a deadline for SS&amp;C to clarify its intentions. </p> <p>Also out today are half-year results from <strong>Britvic</strong> and moneymaker <strong>De La Rue</strong>.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Apple</strong> is suing <strong>NSO Group Technologies</strong>, the spyware group that created surveillance software used to target the mobile phones of journalists, political dissidents and human rights activists, to block it from using its products, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ace7c109-7404-4986-ae11-4074a497c934\">tech team report</a>. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, alleged that NSO had spied on and targeted Apple users and seeks damages as well as an order stopping NSO from using any Apple software, device or services.</p> <p><strong>Samsung</strong> <strong>Electronics</strong> is to build a $17bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bdb3163-59ab-4cb4-b3b5-8970a7290b85\">chip plant in Texas</a> after a push by the Biden administration to expand US semiconductor production. The plant will create more than 2,000 jobs and start operations in around three years time, with construction starting next year. </p> <p><strong>Daniel Loeb's Third Point</strong> has made a profit of around $300m on its stake in <strong>Rivian</strong> in the wake of the electric truckmaker's IPO this month. Loeb made the gains through a series of investments over the past year including in its convertible notes, our correspondent Laurence Fletcher <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10bf413d-cfab-4ace-892b-713e91d759c8\">reports</a>. The hedge fund's performance so far this year is its best in a decade. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Brooke Masters</strong> serves as ringside commentator in the fight between Visa and <strong>Amazon</strong>, after the retailer emailed UK customers to say it planned to stop taking <strong>Visa</strong> credit cards. It is a clash of two titans used to getting their own way, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b779d1c-e0a4-4543-9b39-b66594662074\">she says</a> — and it is a battle of who gets to keep the profits from non-cash payments. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Johnson Matthey spells out cost of battery U-turn' FT.com 24 November.
