  "title": "The Property Report:  Virus Worsens Issues for Investor Visa Program  ----  By Konrad Putzier",
  "text": "<p>   Tens of thousands of foreigners have bought their way to U.S. permanent residency through a federal investor visa program. </p><p>   But this popular shortcut to the American dream is now turning into a nightmare for some amid a rise in lawsuits and fraud cases. The Covid-19 pandemic has made matters worse. </p><p>   Foreigners get what are known as EB-5 visas by investing at least $900,000 in U.S. real-estate projects and other businesses that create jobs. The program has raised more than $40 billion, according to trade group Invest in the USA, and funded developments such as New York City's Hudson Yards. But it has long been dogged by fraud cases. </p><p>   The pandemic has magnified the problem, because many EB-5 projects are hotels, malls and urban apartment buildings whose revenues have dropped during the past year. </p><p>   With a crucial part of the program set to expire, a longstanding overhaul effort is heating up on Capitol Hill. Some senators say they won't agree to an extension without new measures meant to prevent fraud, putting the program's future in doubt. The program has already experienced a decline in fundraising after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services raised the minimum amount from $500,000 to $900,000 in 2019. </p><p>   Attorneys say EB-5 applicants are far more vulnerable to fraud than other real-estate investors. They often don't speak English and know little about the U.S. real-estate market. Once they invest there is usually no way to track their money. \"There's this tremendous amount of opportunity for unsavory developers to abscond with the funds,\" said Gary Friedland, a scholar-in-residence at New York University's Stern School of Business who has researched the EB-5 program. </p><p>   The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged people affiliated with EB-5 projects with violating U.S. laws in 16 cases since 2013, according to Mr. Friedland. This month, one of the people behind an $85 million EB-5 scheme in Vermont pleaded guilty to charges including wire fraud after prosecutors said much of the investors' money was spent on things that had little to do with the project. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Elisa Cho contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
