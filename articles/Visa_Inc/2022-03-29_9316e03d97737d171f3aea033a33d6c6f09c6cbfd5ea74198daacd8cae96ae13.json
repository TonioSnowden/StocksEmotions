  "title": "Consumer watchdog probes $12 billion market for credit card late fees, says charges are a ‘significant hardship' for Americans",
  "text": "<p>The government agency estimated that consumers are charged an average of $26 fee for late payments and that consumers with the lowest credit scores, who typically live in underprivileged zip codes, pay more than $300 per year on late fees alone.</p><p>“For some households, late fees are a costly mistake for payments that may only be a day or two late — for others, they are a significant added hardship during a time of of financial precarity,” the report said. “For credit card companies…late fees continue to bolster their bottom line.”</p><p>Credit card fees are regulated under authority granted by a 2009 law that says late fees must be “reasonable and proportional,” which was implemented at $25 for the first violation and $35 for subsequent missed payments, and the CFPB is required to adjust that figure each year for inflation.</p><p>The CFPB says that credit card issuers earn $120 billion per year from credit card fees and interest, with 10% of that revenue coming from late fees.</p><p>Credit cards are often issued by large banks like Chase JPM and Wells Fargo WFC in partnership with companies like Visa V and Mastercard MA that maintain the payment networks. Many community banks, credit unions and retailers are also involved in credit-card issuance.</p><p>The report comes after the CFPB released an analysis of bank overdraft fees motivating some banks to eliminate those fees and a separate analysis of medical debt on credit reports. Major consumer credit report companies subsequently announced they would no longer include medical debt on their reports.</p>",
