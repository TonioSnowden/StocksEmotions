  "title": "Visa Scraps Plan to Acquire Plaid Amid U.S. Antitrust Challenge",
  "text": "<p>Visa initially vowed to fight the government, and a trial was scheduled for June in a California federal court. Visa and Plaid mutually agreed to end the deal.</p><p>Al Kelly, Visa's chairman and chief executive, said that he believed the companies would eventually have won a legal battle because Plaid's services complemented Visa's. \"However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid, and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve,\" he said.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department's top antitrust official, said the deal's demise was good for consumers. \"Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visa's online debit services,\" he said. \"With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services.\"</p><p>Visa is the largest U.S. card network. Losing out on Plaid is a blow to Visa because the company was aiming to expand its presence and clients in the fintech market. The Plaid acquisition would have allowed Visa to further diversify its payments capabilities beyond cards.</p><p>The government's blocking of the deal also signals a potentially harder road for Visa to acquire companies that could expand its market power in consumer payments.</p><p>Mr. Kelly, on an investor call about the abandonment, said that he wasn't worried the lawsuit would affect Visa's future acquisitions. It is possible that Visa and Plaid could join to provide services to each other's clients, he said. Visa will keep a minority stake in Plaid that it received before its takeover offer.</p><p>San Francisco-based Plaid provides the technological infrastructure underpinning an array of next-generation financial apps, including Venmo, the digital money-transfer service owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. Fintech companies and merchants have viewed Plaid as a platform that could one day enable consumers to make purchases without having to rely on credit or debit cards.</p>",
