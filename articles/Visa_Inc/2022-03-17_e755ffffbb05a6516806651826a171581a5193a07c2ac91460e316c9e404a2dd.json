  "title": "New Gig Surcharges Are Hardly a Gas; Gig-economy users will pay for higher gas prices even if they never set foot in their own cars",
  "text": "<p>U.S. regular unleaded gas prices now average $4.30 a gallon, up around 20% from mid-February and about 50% compared with a year ago, according to GasBuddy. With gig-economy drivers generally expected to pay for their own gas, platforms are now working on ways to compensate drivers for the increased costs. Both Uber Technologies and Lyft have announced in recent days that they will temporarily add surcharges to help their drivers recoup some of the cost of skyrocketing gas. Meanwhile, Just Eat Takeaway-owned Grubhub raised the per-mile pay for all its delivery partners last week and is also offering additional pay based on the estimated total miles driven each week. And DoorDash said in a blog post Tuesday that it will add weekly cash bonuses for drivers who log a certain number of miles.</p><p>The differences in strategy are hardly a barometer of corporate altruism; instead they highlight key industry truths. The first is that the relationship between ride-hailing platforms and their drivers might be more fragile than that of food-delivery platforms and their drivers. DoorDash, for example, seemed to have a lot less trouble with driver supply during the pandemic than ride-hailers, who over the course of the past year have had to lure back drivers with heavy incentives and are only just seeing supply and demand begin to come into balance. Asking consumers to pay extra on every ride—even if the ride is in an electric vehicle—is a way ride-hailers can motivate drivers to come to their platforms without directly adding to their own expenses.</p><p>The second is that food-delivery consumers might be more price-sensitive than ride-hailing consumers. This makes sense: If you're stuck without a car somewhere or can't drive because you don't have a license or you're drunk, sick or working, you have few options other than to call an Uber or Lyft. On the other hand, if you're hungry at home, chances are you don't need a food-delivery platform to eat.</p><p>For its part, Uber, which has both ride-hailing and food-delivery businesses, is charging consumers a smaller surcharge for food delivery than for a ride. The company said this is because food-delivery drivers generally make shorter trips than ride-share drivers and often use other methods of transportation such as bikes, scooters and mopeds. Indeed, DoorDash is only offering bonuses to drivers who accept and complete orders totaling at least 100 miles a week, though it will also offer 10% cash back on gas to all drivers through a prepaid Visa debit card designed for Dashers beginning Thursday.</p><p>No matter the strategy, it is hard to see how things don't get even more expensive for consumers in both industries unless gas prices suddenly decline. Uber has said that driver earnings would remain consistent if every 20% increase in the cost of gas was met with a 1% increase in passenger fares.</p><p>Even doing conservative math, we're already at that point. Uber said its Rides customers will pay a gas surcharge of either 45 cents or 55 cents on each trip for the next 60 days, depending on location. As of mid-February, data from Bloomberg Second Measure shows that U.S. Uber riders were spending an average of $48.09 a week on the platform. Assuming Uber's base fare has held roughly steady—Uber says it didn't make nationwide changes to time and distance rates at the same time it implemented the gas surcharge—and assuming that consumers were taking just one long ride a week on average, Uber's surcharge range would represent about a 1% fee increase per ride. But if they are taking more, shorter rides a week, consumers would pay an even higher percentage.</p><p>Uber has already said that it would continue to monitor gas prices and that it may make additional changes. Even DoorDash said it would explore additional resources to support drivers in the coming weeks. Grubhub says that it periodically adjusts its diner fees and that they scale based on a number of factors.</p><p>Brace for some higher-octane tabs.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>New Gig Surcharges Are Hardly a Gas</p>",
