  "title": "Turkish Central Bank Cuts Rates, Adding to Pressure on Economy; Bank bucks worldwide trend, lowering rates despite high inflation; currency hits record low",
  "text": "<p>The decision continues a policy of cutting interest rates that has caused the lira to lose more than half its value against the U.S. dollar in the past year. The bank cut interest rates four consecutive times in 2021, despite soaring inflation, sparking a chaotic slide in the lira that threatened economic stability in Turkey, which is a member of the Group of 20 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p><p>Turkey suffers from one of the world's highest rates of inflation, which surpassed 80% in the country in August. Mainstream economists call for raising interest rates in order to address inflation. Mr. Erdogan believes the opposite, and has also expressed religious objections to high interest rates.</p><p>\"This is a chaotic situation,\" said Mustafa SÃ¶nmez, a Turkish economist.</p><p>Central banks throughout the world, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been raising interest rates in recent months to curb rampant inflation caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, high energy prices, global supply-chain issues and economic growth in the wake of the pandemic.</p><p>The hawkish moves by other major central banks, along with the strengthening dollar, are adding to the pressure on Turkey and other emerging-market economies, which now face higher prices for imports.</p><p>The Turkish central bank has also spent tens of billions of dollars in foreign currency in interventions to prevent a more severe slide in the lira, economists say. The Turkish lira has shed more than a quarter of its value against the dollar this year.</p><p>Increasing prices of basic goods such as food, fuel and medicine have contributed to a rise in popular discontent over the economy in Turkey that has eroded Mr. Erdogan's base of support, threatening his hold on power after nearly two decades in which he has ruled Turkey as both prime minister and president. Recent opinion polls show Mr. Erdogan losing or in a dead heat with potential challengers in an election scheduled for next year.</p><p>Mr. Erdogan has turned to Russia to bolster the Turkish economy, accelerating trade between the two countries and welcoming inflows of Russian money that have helped Turkey shore up the foreign assets needed to stabilize the lira.</p><p>Turkey's deepening economic ties with Russia have led to Western pressure over concerns that Mr. Erdogan is helping the Russian government and oligarchs evade sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Two major Turkish banks this week said they dropped the use of Russia's Mir card after the U.S. sanctioned the head of the payment system, which is an alternative to Visa and Mastercard.</p><p>The lira's fall against the dollar has also made it more expensive for Turkey to repay debts denominated in dollars, worrying some investors. The yield on a Turkish dollar bond maturing in March 2027 has risen to 10.325% from 7.402% at the end of last year. Yields rise when the price of bonds falls.</p><p>Turkey's stock market has outperformed other markets, with its benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 index up 77% this year. Locals in high-inflation economies sometimes prefer to put their savings into stocks rather than other assets because companies can increase prices alongside inflation, boosting returns.</p><p>Economists said pressure on Turkey's economy is likely to grow in the coming months as the country's energy bills rise in the colder winter months. Mr. Erdogan has touted cheap Russian gas as an economic benefit for Turkey.</p><p>\"They will need budget support for energy companies. This winter will be really, really hard,\" said Ugur Gurses, a Turkish economist.</p><p>Caitlin Ostroff and Chelsey Dulaney contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com</p><p>Turkish Central Bank Cuts Rates, Adding to Pressure on Economy</p>",
