  "text": "<p><em>The writer is president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee and a former UK foreign secretary</em></p> <p>It is too late to debate the case for the US, and therefore Nato's, military withdrawal from Afghanistan. It's happened. The fact that it has been telegraphed across successive administrations does not make it less destabilising. The danger now is that the Afghan people are left defenceless.</p> <p>Impunity is a hallmark of the current crisis. More than 5,000 civilians were killed or injured in the first half of 2021, a 47 per cent rise from the same period last year. There are many books and speeches about how Afghanistan is a “graveyard of empires”. It should command our attention today as a graveyard of innocent people and their hopes for a better future.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>More than 350,000 people are on the move inside the country. Neighbouring states like Pakistan, Iran and India fear a refugee exodus, with 30,000 fleeing the country each week. And there are Afghans making their way to Europe.</p> <p>You can see why they are fleeing. It is not just the fighting. Nearly half the population, more than 18m people, need humanitarian aid (a number that doubled from January 2020 to January 2021). The Covid-19 pandemic rages, with enough vaccines for only 9 per cent of the population. An extreme drought hit swaths of the country. Meanwhile, there is massive political uncertainty.&#xa0;</p> <p>At a time when Afghanistan is being torn apart by violence and fear, it is not enough to say, “Let them sort it out on their own.” Here are four priorities.</p> <p>First, untended humanitarian crisis will fuel political crisis. Yet the UN's Humanitarian Response Plan has received only 37 per cent of its required funds for 2021. The UK slashed its aid commitment from $78m last year to $18m so far this year. The US has not increased its aid commitment (around $260m).&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Non-governmental organisations like the International Rescue Committee worked in the country before, during and after the Taliban takeover in the 1990s. All but a handful are Afghans and the IRC will stay and deliver aid now. But we need donors to deliver more funds, more flexibly. We need to move programming within the country as access, security and needs change.&#xa0;</p> <p>Second, the drive towards a political settlement under the Trump administration had a number of serious flaws, including the marginalisation of the Afghan government and the country's women from the process. However, its failure to establish a parallel regional process doomed any internal political compromise. Stability depends on the neighbours, not just on Afghans. The region has a lot at risk and its stability is vital now. </p> <p>The decision by Afghanistan's neighbours to close their borders to Afghans, leaving people with nowhere to go, is not sustainable. It is vital for the international system to uphold the rights of Afghans and work to help countries which are already supporting large numbers of refugees, with more than 2m in Pakistan alone.</p> <p>Third, there is a particular debt of honour owed to Afghans who are being targeted because they worked for the US or other western governments or organisations. The debt is paid through resettlement to safety and a new life. The US has made the welcome move to widen pathways to safety, through the Special Immigrant Visa and now a Priority Two designation.&#xa0; </p> <p>As is evident from the weekend, the US must ensure a safe and orderly departure for all US-affiliated partners who need immediate safety. And it must add capacity to make these programmes work efficiently and rapidly, allowing applicants to apply in-country and scaling up regional processing. Other governments must do the same. The numbers currently being helped, around 10,000 a year, are far too small. There are reports that many applicants to the UK scheme have been rejected — this needs to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdb1dfe2-18ca-4d7b-8d69-9bd89d13c15d\">be addressed</a>.</p> <p>Finally, it takes political and economic muscle as well as humanitarian aid to mitigate the drift towards chaos, or worse. UN and national representation is vital. The diplomatic and multilateral community must maintain its presence alongside humanitarians to support the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and engage with the range of political actors in the country. </p> <p>It is going to take a huge and concerted effort with all parties to the conflict to reverse the trend towards attacks against humanitarian facilities, personnel, transport and supplies, and to protect civilians as the fighting continues.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is too easy to say that the past 20 years prove that Afghanistan, still one of the world's poorest countries, is a hopeless case. A generation has grown up with improved education and extended freedom of thought and action. They represent a different future for the country. The price of trying to support them is low, but the cost of leaving them to fend for themselves very high.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/7d024732-525b-4553-9f27-128391dcf114.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: David Miliband 2021 'We cannot abandon a new generation of Afghans to chaos ' FT.com 16 August.
