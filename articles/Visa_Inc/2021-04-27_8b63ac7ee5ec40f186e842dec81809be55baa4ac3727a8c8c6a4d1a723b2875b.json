The population grew 10.2 per cent in the south from 2010-20, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 9.2 per cent in the west, 4.1 per cent in the north-east and 3.1 per cent in the Midwest.</p> <p>The numbers hold<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9fcf4c8-a2a0-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1\"> political significance</a> because they will be used to reallocate the 435 congressional districts ahead of next year's midterm elections. Democrats control the House by a margin of just six seats.</p> <p>The Census Bureau said that, because of the population shifts, Texas will gain two seats in the House; Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon will each gain one; and seven states — California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia — will each lose one.</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The White House has announced that the <strong>US</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db461dd7-b132-4f08-a94e-b23a6764bdb3\">share up to 60m doses</a> of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with other countries.

The California secretary of state's office said on Monday that it had verified enough signatures on a petition to force what will be only the second recall in the history of the most populous US state.</p> <p><strong>Nomura posts $2.9bn Archegos loss</strong> Nomura has said its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c480d5c0-ccf7-41de-8f56-03686a4556b6\">total loss</a> from the implosion of Archegos Capital, the family office run by trader <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7e0f57b-3751-42b8-8a17-eb7749f4dbc8\">Bill Hwang</a>, will hit almost $2.9bn.

But according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a164171-446a-4e26-b6b1-893c4b85c216\">critic Victor Sebestyen</a>, Serhii Plokhy's <em>Nuclear Folly</em> is arguably “the most authoritative and cleverly written” account yet of the “bad judgment calls and worse information-gathering” that, in late 1962, led the world to the brink of catastrophe.</p> <h2>Meet our journalists: Christine Zhang&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p>Christine Zhang is a data reporter for the FT in New York.
