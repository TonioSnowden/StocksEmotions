  "title": "Superyachts, Seaside Apartments and Suitcases Full of Cash: Russians Pour Money Into Turkey; Western sanctions and capital controls imposed by Moscow have sent Russians looking for havens for their cash and assets",
  "text": "<p>Since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, thousands of Russians have flown to Turkey, one of a shrinking number of countries where they can still fly directly, with many choosing to stay. Some of these Russians are relocating to cosmopolitan Istanbul or coastal resort cities like Antalya, a popular tourist destination for Russians before the war that is becoming a permanent home for some.</p><p>The Russians are using a variety of means to overcome Western sanctions that cut off some Russian banks from the Swift payment system and capital controls imposed by Moscow that limit the amount of foreign currency Russians can send abroad. Among the most common are Russian cash-transfer companies that operate in Turkey, cryptocurrencies and simply carrying thousands of dollars in cash through airports, according to Russians and Turks interviewed for this article.</p><p>The Turkish government has said it won't stop Russian funds flowing in, even from oligarchs, as long as the money is legal. Turkey badly needs foreign currency after an economic crisis last year that caused its currency, the lira, to lose about 45% of its value against the dollar in less than three months. The U.S., U.K., and European Union have imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs with alleged ties to President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"If you mean that these oligarchs can do any business in Turkey, then of course. If it is legal, and it is not against international law, I will consider it. If it is against international law, then that's another story,\" said Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, speaking to an international conference in Doha, Qatar, on March 26.</p><p>The U.S. government has been silent on Russians moving their money, with Washington praising Ankara's role in hosting Russian-Ukrainian peace talks.</p><p>Inflows of Russian money may already be helping Turkey's finances at the margins.</p><p>Turkey's central bank took in about $3 billion in just two days in mid-March resulting from swaps with domestic banks, according to publicly available data. That money was likely largely composed of deposits from Russians, said Omer Gencal, an economist and former executive at HSBC Turkey and other major Turkish banks.</p><p>\"This money poured into Turkish banks, and they transferred it to the central bank via swap deals,\" said Mr. Gencal. \"They see Turkey as a safe haven,\" he said of the Russians.</p><p>Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has driven an increase in Russians buying property in Turkey, including some who have invested more than $250,000 each to acquire a Turkish passport under the country's citizenship-through-investment program, real-estate brokers said.</p><p>Gül Gül, the chief executive of Istanbul real-estate company Golden Sign, said that in the past month Russians have begun to outnumber her previous base of clients, who mostly came from Arab countries. The newly arrived Russians are buying as many as four apartments at a time, usually with cash, in order to invest the $250,000 required for citizenship.</p><p>\"Currently, out of 10 flats we sell, six or seven are bought by Russians,\" said Ms. Gül. \"They are mostly businesspeople, wealthy ones, some of them oligarchs.\"</p><p>Among the oligarchs who have parked their assets in Turkey is Roman Abramovich, who has moved two of his superyachts to Turkish ports in recent weeks, though one has since left. Mr. Abramovich has unexpectedly emerged as a player in Russian-Ukrainian peace negotiations brokered by Turkey. After weeks of operating a back channel to Mr. Putin, Mr. Abramovich showed up at formal negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on March 29. Mr. Abramovich didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Another yacht owned by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a 74-meter-long vessel called Universe, docked in Istanbul last week, according to publicly available ship-tracking data.</p><p>At the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, the Turkish government scrutinized Russian money flowing in.</p><p>Turkish lenders, particularly private banks, have also been wary of running afoul of Western sanctions, according to bankers and analysts. The banks strictly applied government rules—for example, a requirement to obtain a residence permit before opening a bank account, according to people familiar with the rules.</p><p>Those initial restrictions soon gave way to a more permissive approach to Russian money. At a single branch of one state-owned bank in Istanbul, Russians have opened more than 600 accounts in recent weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the accounts.</p><p>Many of those fleeing Russia are young people including artists, tech workers, academics and others who opposed the invasion of Ukraine or fear they could be drafted into the military. Many left carrying hundreds or thousands of dollars in cash because of capital controls that the Russian government imposed.</p><p>\"I don't want my money to be used to kill Ukrainians,\" said Ruslan Vovchenko, a 25-year-old graphic designer who traveled to Istanbul from Moscow in March after protesting the war. \"If I can't change the system, I'll remove myself from the system.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What role do you see Turkey playing in the Russia-Ukraine war? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The exodus of young Russians has meant that a range of Russian and foreign companies have had to adjust to the fact that a significant portion of their workforce has fled.</p><p>Search-engine company Yandex, classified-ad site Avito, commercial bank Tinkoff and software firm DataArt collectively had more than 1,000 workers fly to Turkey, according to people familiar with the matter. About 900 Yandex workers flew to Turkey shortly after the beginning of the war, though around 300 of them have since left, said a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Yandex said it \"offers an opportunity to work remotely, and some employees work from different locations, including Turkey. We do not regulate their whereabouts.\" DataArt said it is exiting Russia and expects several hundred employees to leave the country by this summer, but didn't comment on the number going to Turkey.</p><p>Western sanctions and Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc.'s decisions to shut down operations in Russia have prompted Russians to get creative about how to move their money. One option is the Russian Mir payment system, which works at certain locations in Turkey. \"We accept Mir\" signs have begun cropping up in grocery stores around Istanbul.</p><p>Middle-class Russians have mostly brought a few thousand dollars at a time, either in cash or by using Russian wire-transfer companies that continue to operate in Turkey. One popular service is KoronaPay, which allows people to wire money out of Russia and withdraw money in Turkey and a range of other countries. The company allows transfers worth more than 15,000 euros, equivalent to $16,400, as long as customers verify their source of income, according to the company's website.</p><p>\"They're paid in rubles so they bring rubles,\" said Volkan Celikyurek, a money changer in Istanbul's Laleli neighborhood, which is frequented by Russian traders and one of the only areas where exchange offices buy and sell rubles.</p><p>\"I bought at most 100,000 rubles at a time. But there are those who bought millions,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com</p><p>Superyachts, Seaside Apartments and Suitcases Full of Cash: Russians Pour Money Into Turkey</p>",
