  "title": "The Afghanistan Crisis: Evacuees Face Filth, Overcrowding --- Kabul airport 'is now a refugee camp,' says a U.S. official, as Afghans flee the Taliban",
  "text": "<p>\"We are aware of and as concerned as anybody what had been some terrible sanitation conditions at Qatar that were facilitated by the sheer numbers and the speed with which they all got there,\" said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.</p><p>A cable sent to the State Department by staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, details scenes of chaos and peril outside the gates of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport, with hostile Taliban guards and criminal gangs surrounding it. For those who manage to get through the gates, more hardship awaits.</p><p>\"Some staff told each other they would prefer to die with dignity at home rather than suffer the humiliation, danger and frustration of the existing system at the airport,\" the cable, sent over the weekend, said, referring to Afghan staff employed by the embassy or other U.S. agencies.</p><p>Abdul, 32 years old, says he is one of many U.S. Embassy workers with a visa application in process who is trying to get to the airport with his young family. He said he was starting to feel desperate after being unable to reach his supervisors or receive any response from the embassy.</p><p>\"I have been trying to get into the airport for the last one week, but I failed to do so because of my wife and my small children,\" he said, adding that his children were 11 months and 28 months old. \"I cannot play with their lives.\"</p><p>The Journal tried to contact his supervisor, and received no answer. The State Department's press officer didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>So far, 63,900 American citizens, other foreigners and allies and Afghan civilians have been evacuated, most of whom have left since the fall of Kabul on Aug. 14, officials said.</p><p>The U.S. has told refugee-resettlement agencies to prepare for the arrival of as many as 50,000 Afghans airlifted out of Kabul, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Some of the people would be allowed into the country under a temporary immigration program known as humanitarian parole, which allows people to live and work in the country for a set amount of time. The evacuees brought to the U.S. using parole typically wouldn't qualify or hadn't yet applied for a Special Immigrant Visa or a related refugee program intended for Afghans who worked with the U.S. military or American nonprofit organizations.</p><p>The lucky ones who have boarded flights often aren't screened, and some early evacuees may not have had a credible connection with the U.S.</p><p>\"Most of those crowding the airport gates had never worked for the United States,\" the embassy memo said. An Afghan embassy staffer \"spoke to airport workers and children from the neighborhood around the airport who went to the airport as evacuations began. None, he said, had any connection to the U.S. government.\"</p><p>A U.S. official involved in evacuations told the Journal that whoever got to the front of the mob outside the airport first got in regardless of their connections to the U.S.</p><p>\"This was all because of optics to show planes full of people,\" the official said. \"American citizens are stuck outside the gates and people are going to die in our care because we let them all in -- some incredibly sick, wounded, literally half dead. The airport is now a refugee camp.\"</p><p>The Pentagon said Tuesday it had expanded the number of American bases in Europe and the Middle East to reduce the crowding at the three main hubs Afghan evacuees are transiting through -- U.S. bases in Bahrain, Qatar and Germany. Evacuees are now being flown to bases in Sigonella, Italy, and Rota, Spain, said Army Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor, an operations officer at the Pentagon's Joint Staff.</p><p>Officials at those military hubs said much work had been done at the sites, including installing more portable hand-washing stations, delivering refrigeration trucks for cold water and food, Gen. Taylor said.</p><p>Still, thousands of Afghans remain packed into the U.S.'s Al Ubeid Air Base in Qatar without air conditioning, access to toilets or water.</p><p>\"Staff shared reports that Afghan refugees in Qatar were not eating or drinking to avoid using the poor facilities,\" the memo said. \"Some claimed they slept on the floor for days and feared contracting COVID-19 in crowded facilities amid a lack of medical care.\"</p><p>Details in the memo were earlier reported by NBC News.</p><p>Qatar said it is committed to tackling the issues. Mr. Kirby said the situation had improved, but isn't where it should be. \"No one here wants anyone to be less than safe, secure, comfortable and well-cared for,\" he said.</p>",
