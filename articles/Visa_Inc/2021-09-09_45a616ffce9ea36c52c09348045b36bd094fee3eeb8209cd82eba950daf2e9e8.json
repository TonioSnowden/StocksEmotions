  "title": "Taliban to Allow 200 Americans, Other Foreigners to Fly Out of Kabul; No Afghans without foreign citizenship are expected to be allowed on the flight to Qatar",
  "text": "<p>The Qatari official said it wasn't an evacuation flight as all the passengers hold proper foreign passports and, if required, visas to their destinations, and have been ticketed by the airline. Qatar is facilitating the movement to the airport in a convoy of minibuses that were parked Thursday morning in a Kabul hotel, one of them with a bullet hole through the windshield. Most of the foreign citizens still in Afghanistan are dual nationals.</p><p>The Taliban have consistently pledged to allow foreigners to leave unimpeded. At Tuesday's press conference announcing the formation of the new government of their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the movement's spokesman and new deputy information minister, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that problems with international travel would be resolved soon. \"When Afghans and foreigners want to leave Afghanistan, they should do it lawfully, having a passport and visa,\" he said.</p><p>U.S. forces rendered the radar and other equipment at the Kabul airport inoperable as they left on Aug. 30, concluding an emergency airlift that transported some 120,000 foreigners and Afghans who had helped the West during the 20-year war. Since then, Qatar sent a team of technicians to restore some flight-control capabilities, and Ariana Afghan Airlines resumed flight-by-sight domestic connections to the cities of Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar and Herat on Saturday.</p><p>The flight planned for Thursday doesn't address the issue of tens of thousands of Afghans at risk who haven't been able to leave the country during the U.S.-led airlift. The U.S. has estimated that the majority of Afghans who qualify for the so-called Special Immigrant Visa because of having helped American military and civilian efforts remain stranded in Afghanistan.</p><p>While Washington said last month that it had received commitments from the Taliban to allow Afghans with clearance to enter foreign nations to fly out, the country's new authorities desperately want to prevent a brain drain that would undermine any effort to stave off economic collapse.</p><p>At meetings on Sunday with the United Nations' undersecretary general and emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, Taliban leaders were \"furious with the evacuation of skilled and educated people, who are greatly needed to rebuild the country,\" according to an internal U.N. readout of the conversations that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Taliban leaders \"urged that no further people flee, and help facilitate also conditions for return, and their return,\" the document added.</p><p>For more than a week, about 100 Americans and hundreds of at-risk Afghans looking to flee the country have been waiting in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on a deal to allow them to fly out on charter flights. Mazar-e-Sharif's international airport hasn't been damaged. These negotiations have been bogged down, thwarting the efforts.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed the Taliban on Wednesday to allow people to leave.</p><p>\"The Taliban are not permitting the charter flights to depart. They claim that some of the passengers do not have the required documentation,\" he told reporters at a press conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas at Ramstein Air Base, where thousands of Afghans who fled the country are staying while various Western governments try to work on resettlement plans. \"We've made clear to all parties—we've made it clear to the Taliban—that these charters need to be able to depart.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, Taliban officials told organizers working on the charter flights that they would allow Americans and others with valid passports and visas to fly out of Kabul, but not from Mazar-e-Sharif. At the same time, U.S. officials started calling Americans waiting in Mazar-e-Sharif for flights and told them to come to Kabul.</p><p>It remained unclear how many Americans in Mazar-e-Sharif could make it back to Kabul for Thursday's flight. U.S. officials have vowed to help all Afghans who worked with America over the last two decades that want to leave.</p><p>Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com and Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com</p><p>Taliban to Allow 200 Americans, Other Foreigners to Fly Out of Kabul</p>",
