  "title": "Lawmakers Seeking to Get Afghan Allies on Kabul Flights Ask Biden to 'Try Harder'; Families, veterans and human-rights groups are also organizing their own chartered planes from Afghanistan",
  "text": "<p>Lawmakers from both parties and chambers said that the military, foreign service and immigration systems needed to cut processing restrictions that have hampered entry to the airport, follow through on a new law broadening eligibility for the program, expand security to enable travel to the airport, and commit to staying in the country until vulnerable Afghans—and not just Americans—are evacuated.</p><p>\"I would like them to try harder,\" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), who with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) on Thursday wrote a letter signed by 55 lawmakers calling on President Biden to implement provisions in a July law that allow Afghans to obtain special immigrant visas after only one year of working for the U.S. government, instead of two years.</p><p>Such concerns got a new airing on Friday, when lawmakers received unclassified briefings by telephone—one for the House and one for the Senate—with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.</p><p>On the call, the officials didn't provide details on the number of people with special-immigrant-visa status who had been evacuated. Members complained that people they were trying to help had been turned away from the gates, and asked what the official Biden administration policy was on extending the withdrawal beyond Mr. Biden's Aug. 31 target date, according to people on the call. Mr. Biden has indicated he would be flexible on that deadline if more time were needed to rescue Americans, and on Friday suggested that he would treat Afghans the same way.</p><p>But Mr. Milley told lawmakers that the U.S. was still operating with Aug. 31 as the deadline and that if military officials had more time, they would use it, and were still talking to the Taliban.</p><p>\"There's no way to keep the promise the president made if we leave on Aug. 31,\" said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D., N.J.). \"Anything short of that is an acknowledgment that we are going to leave a lot of people behind.\"</p><p>Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.) said that he was encouraged by Mr. Biden's remarks about Afghans, but that after listening to both the briefing and the president, he wasn't yet convinced that the U.S. was making the same level of commitment to Afghans as to Americans.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What should the U.S. government do about the stranded Afghans? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In addition to members of Congress, advocacy groups led by veterans trying to get their former Afghan colleagues out of the country and other human-rights-focused organizations are trying to organize their own rescue operations.</p><p>Americans are also raising money for their own charter flights. One example is a GoFundMe operation organized by veterans and human-rights advocates that has raised over $6 million, far over the $500,000 target, to charter two evacuation flights. The group now plans to charter as many flights as possible with the extra funding and has widened its base of volunteers to assist with the effort.</p><p>Tensions at the Kabul international airport have escalated over the week. On Thursday, the Taliban fired shots over people's heads at the airport in an effort to disperse the crowd, and many Afghans have reported being beatenfor trying to get in. The crowds that managed to pass through Taliban lines were met with tear gas fired by American soldiers and found themselves caught between sides.</p><p>Some visa applicants have lost their passports and paperwork after they were destroyed at the U.S. Embassy by staff there to protect the applicants' identities from the Taliban. Even those with valid travel documents have been turned away, resulting in flights with some empty seats this week.</p><p>\"The problem is still getting to the airport. It's impossible, it's so disorganized, it's such a mess,\" said one Afghan man, who escaped to the U.S. on Saturday and is trying to rescue his brother who is on an evacuation list but can't reach the terminal.</p><p>\"I am not hearing a lot of improvement in the last couple of days,\" said Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.), who served in Afghanistan as an Army ranger and who has flagged to the State Department the cases of at least 800 Afghans with SIV status. \"This is not happening at the speed at which it needs to be.\"</p><p>The State Department said Thursday that about 7,000 people have been evacuated since Saturday, when an increased U.S. troop presence at the airport allowed operations to ramp up. Another 6,000 have reached the terminal and have been cleared to fly.</p><p>Reflecting the chaotic situation on the ground, State Department spokesman Ned Price was unable to say how many were Americans, embassy staff or visa applicants. The total is still just a fraction of the number of people that may need to be evacuated.</p><p>The State Department has said that thousands of American citizens remain on the ground in Afghanistan, along with U.S. Embassy local staff, their families, and Special Immigrant Visa applicants and their families with paper in the pipeline. Congressional sources say the SIV applicants alone could number as many as 20,000, with an estimated 70,000 family members with paperwork in the pipeline.</p><p>In addition, the State Department has previously said that a new priority visa category for a wider group of Afghans could apply to tens of thousands more people.</p><p>Calls on behalf of these Afghans, who fear reprisal from the Taliban for helping the U.S. and include interpreters and others that served alongside U.S. troops, diplomats and other personnel, are growing louder.</p><p>Mr. Biden said this week that he would be willing to extend the Aug. 31 deadline he had set for a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan to get more people out, which may be too narrow a time frame to evacuate everyone that may be eligible for a visa, or even all Americans. U.S. military officials say the Taliban may not agree to an extension.</p><p>A U.S. military official said that the risk of clashes with the Taliban would be higher after the Aug. 31 deadline and could make it difficult to keep troops past that date.</p><p>Some lawmakers said it sounded like Mr. Biden might be willing to be flexible with his own deadline only on behalf of Americans. \"It's my understanding that the president made a commitment to get American citizens out,\" Mr. Crow said. \"I did not understand that commitment to apply to our Afghan partners.\"</p><p>Little about helping vulnerable Afghans who have worked directly for the U.S. government is easy, in part because of the numerous chokepoints in the system of identifying, transporting and resettling the population.</p><p>Several lawmakers said that getting vulnerable Afghans dispersed across the country to Kabul for evacuation would require more troops to secure a broader area. That, in turn, would require changing the mission the military has been given, they said.</p><p>\"I don't think we have the troops that can go out and ensure safe passage,\" Ms. Ernst said, worrying about whether the Taliban would view that as a signal to challenge or threaten service members. \"If they had kept the Embassy, if they had kept Bagram Air Field, then this would be much, much easier.\"</p><p>Among the at-risk Afghans stuck in the processing logjam is the family of Zamzama Safi, a 25-year-old interpreter who left Afghanistan on Sunday on a commercial flight after she took the risk of carrying a physical copy of her passport, with her visa and airline ticket saved electronically on her iPhone.</p><p>By late Friday, her sisters, brother and mother had to go home after spending almost 24 hours in line at the East gate. They made it past a second checkpoint, but their mother passed out, according to an aide to Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D., Mo.), who had helped Ms. Safi fly to Missouri.</p><p>\"We're trying to get people out in an emergency,\" said Mr. Cleaver, who is also working to evacuate some 20 other people. \"We need to fly people out, just get them out of Afghanistan, get them to a safe location, and then go through the vetting.\"</p><p>Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Jessica Donati at jessica.donati@wsj.com</p><p>Lawmakers Seeking to Get Afghan Allies on Kabul Flights Ask Biden to 'Try Harder'</p>",
