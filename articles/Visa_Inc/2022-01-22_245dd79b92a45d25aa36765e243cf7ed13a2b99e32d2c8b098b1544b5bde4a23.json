  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is making a series of policy changes aimed at easing the path for foreign students and professionals in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math to remain in the U.S. on a long-term basis. </p><p>   The new policies are designed to retain foreign students educated in the U.S. in STEM fields to boost innovation while keeping pace with competitors such as China, senior administration officials said. </p><p>   The most significant of the changes will expand the number of disciplines that international students can study to qualify to work in the U.S. on their student visas. With the change, students in those disciplines will be permitted to work in the U.S. for three years after graduation, rather than the one year offered to all international students. </p><p>   In all, the Department of Homeland Security is planning to add 22 new eligible degree fields, including data science and financial analytics. The changes take effect immediately. </p><p></p>",
