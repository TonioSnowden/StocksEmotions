  "text": "<p>There was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.</p><p>Soldiers are also emerging from the airport and coming out into the perimeter, which is surrounded by Taliban, to disperse crowds and clear the way for families struggling to get in, videos clips taken by passengers show.</p><p>Thousands of Afghans are still pushing to get into the airport, following the Taliban's takeover of Kabul on Sunday. North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and partners have evacuated nearly 20,000 people from Kabul airport since last weekend, according to public announcements by officials.</p><p>To reach the airport, Afghans and foreigners have to get past Taliban checkpoints, where Taliban fighters are firing in the air and using violence to hold back crowds.</p><p>The three entry gates to the airport remain blocked with people pushing to get inside. In order to allow families, including women and children, into the airport, security forces are using tear gas and firing into the air to disperse the crowd, Western officials said.</p><p>Tear gas was used Thursday and Friday at the airport, say people who have accessed the airport and officials.</p><p>A senior British official said Friday morning that the government was speeding up evacuations and had flown 963 people from Kabul in the past 24 hours.</p><p>\"That's a significant acceleration on the numbers over the previous 24 hours,\" Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told Sky News, \"and reflects I think that we're now fully up to speed, with military and foreign office consular staff all now up and running.\"</p><p>The numbers evacuated in the coming days should be similar, he said.</p><p>Mr. Heappey said that he understood that the Taliban weren't turning people away from the airport.</p><p>\"Where they have done that, I've heard that it's more that they are being officious rather than malicious,\" he said. People called for flights should have confidence that the Taliban would let them through, he said.</p><p>Mr. Heappey said he couldn't put a time frame on how long the Royal Air Force's evacuation operation would last.</p><p>\"Eventually the air bridge will have to close and quite possibly not everybody will have been got out. That's what keeps us awake at night. That's what's motivating to us to work as hard as we are to ensure that those numbers are the absolute minimum,\" he said.</p><p>One Afghan man who has worked for a U.S. contractor and who has an approved Special Immigrant Visa for the U.S. said he arrived at the airport on Thursday and attempted all night to enter. His family carried their children on their shoulders to prevent them from being crushed. However, he failed and gave up Friday morning, returning home exhausted.</p><p>\"We were stuck between the aggression of the Taliban and U.S. forces in the gate,\" said the man. \"I don't know if I will ever be able to get out.\"</p><p>In addition to the thousands of American troops at the airport, including Marines, there are British soldiers as well as soldiers from Afghan security forces who didn't surrender to the Taliban and who are also providing security in cooperation with international troops. These Afghans are members of CIA-trained units, Western officials say.</p><p>At the checkpoints, the Taliban are searching for key individuals from the ousted government, a report from the Norwegian Center for Global Analyses said. The Taliban are going house to house in Kabul, hunting down people associated with the former government of President Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan leader who fled the country on Sunday.</p><p>If the militants can't find the individuals they seek, they are arresting members of their families, the report said. Before taking Kabul and other major cities, the group had already assembled a target list of individuals, which has now been augmented.</p><p>\"The Taliban are arresting and/or threatening to kill or arrest family members of target individuals unless they surrender themselves to the Taliban,\" the report said. \"Taliban are rapidly recruiting new informer networks eager to collaborate with the new regime.\"</p><p>Since Saturday, the U.S. has evacuated 9,000 people, including a mix of U.S. citizens, Afghans who had worked with the U.S. government, and others.</p><p>James Marson contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Forces Use Tear Gas to Control Crowds at Kabul Airport</p>",
