  "text": "<p>Late last year. Amazon AMZNannounced it would no longer accept Visa V credit cards issued in the U.K. starting in 2022, due to the “high cost of payments,” though Visa argued that its fees were competitive.</p><p>“Visa is pleased to have reached a broad, global agreement with Amazon. This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives to ensure innovative payment experiences for our customers in the future,” said the credit-card provider.</p><p>Amazon will also stop charging Visa users extra fees in Singapore and Australia.</p><p>Some analysts at the time said the move was possibly a negotiating tactic by Amazon, and could even push some consumers toward Mastercard MA or American Express AXPAXP.</p>",
