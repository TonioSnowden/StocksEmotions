  "text": "<p>Thousands of Afghans seeking to flee their homeland face a series of ordeals as they try to reach Kabul's airport and contend for a spot on a departing flight. They are avoiding checkpoints manned by Taliban fighters who have surrounded the facility. They are also navigating bureaucratic obstacles in hopes that they won't be turned back upon reaching the airport's heavily guarded gates. And they are doing it on the clock.</p><p>The Biden administration is considering whether to extend the evacuation effort past an Aug. 31 deadline when all U.S. troops are set to leave Afghanistan. Growing disorder, however, has engulfed the operation, including a gunbattle that broke out at the airport Monday, killing at least one Afghan soldier.</p><p>Thousands of people have thronged the airport since the Taliban seized Kabul on Aug. 15. A force of 6,000 U.S. troops has allowed the U.S. and its allies to airlift Westerners from the country along with thousands of Afghans who assisted them over the course of two decades.</p><p>Months ago, Mr. Laghmanai's family received a threatening letter from the Taliban, referencing his ties to the Americans. After the fundamentalist Islamic force entered Kabul, its members searched one of his relatives' homes while the men of the family hid.</p><p>Mr. Laghmanai, who left Afghanistan in 2013, said visa applications for his family to join him in the U.S. have been pending for more than a year. In the early hours last Thursday, the family headed to the airport hoping to use a visa in Mr. Laghmanai's name. By nightfall, the gate still hadn't opened. Mr. Laghmanai's father, a doctor who worked for the Afghan government, continued to wait with his other five children, hiding his face under a mask, before returning home.</p><p>Over the weekend, his father's Special Immigrant Visa was approved. But the visa is of little help if the family can't get to the airport.</p><p>Worried that his family won't make it out before Aug. 31, Mr. Laghmanai has begun to agonize over whether he should find a way back to Afghanistan and try to help his family evacuate in person.</p><p>\"I know it's risky. I know I'd be playing with my life,\" he said. \"I can't just wait to see them, going through this chaos every day.\"</p><p>Mansur, a 29-year-old Afghan who lives in Torrance, Calif., is working to get his uncle, aunt and their two daughters out of Kabul.</p><p>One of his uncle's daughters worked for a high-ranking official in the Afghan government, Mansur says, a job she quit in March after receiving numerous threats.</p><p>Upon her resignation, the official issued a letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal that said she was stopped more than once by unknown men telling her to quit her job. The men also warned her father that she and her family would have to \"face the consequences\" if she didn't resign.</p><p>America's Longest War: A Visual History of 20 Years in Afghanistan</p><p>The family reached the airport last Thursday and slept there overnight. On Friday, they got pulled into the facility, and the daughter used the letter from her former employer to get past airport security checkpoints. At the fourth and final one, she showed the letter but was turned back.</p><p>The family is now hiding at a relative's house near the airport. \"People know who they are. People know where they live,\" Mansur said.</p><p>Mujgon Niazi expected to spend August studying for the Medical College Admission Test and picking out venues for her wedding. Instead, she has been on the phone day and night trying to help her fiancé escape Kabul.</p><p>Ms. Niazi, a 25-year-old Afghan-American who lives in Elk Grove, Calif., has spent hours each day on WhatsApp with her fiancé, keeping him apprised of any State Department alerts and steadying his nerves.</p><p>Her fiancé made a half-dozen trips to the airport between last Wednesday and Sunday but gave up each time, after either failing to make it inside or fleeing Taliban gunfire.</p><p>\"I don't know what he's going to do,\" said Ms. Niazi, who filled out a State Department evacuation application for her fiancé last week and contacted elected officials for help. \"I don't know how he's going to leave the country.\"</p><p>The couple have been waiting since December for the U.S. to complete one of the final steps in his visa application so he can join her in California. In late July, the State Department informed them that he would soon get a required interview at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. </p><p>Ms. Niazi has spent hours each day on WhatsApp with her fiancé, keeping him apprised of any State Department alerts and steadying his nerves. PHOTO: Andri Tambunan for the Wall Street Journal</p><p>On Friday night, Ms. Niazi's fiancé finally made it inside the airport and reached a gate. He showed U.S. soldiers an airport admissions pass that the State Department had emailed him last week and his visa paperwork, but they wouldn't let him through.</p><p>He spent the next 48 hours at the gate without food and exposed to the sun, hoping the soldiers would reconsider, Ms. Niazi said. On Sunday night, her fiancé fled the area when fighting broke out between U.S. soldiers and the Taliban, she said. He had to jump over a barbed-wire fence as Taliban forces beat him with sticks, she said.</p><p>Her fiancé is now back at his apartment, unsure of what to do.</p><p>Mohammad, a 40-year-old Afghan who worked as an interpreter for the U.S. military from 2005 to 2012, hustled his family to the airport shortly after the Taliban swept into Kabul only to confront a heavily guarded entrance.</p><p>By then, Mohammad was already in touch with Lt. Col. Mark Sabroski, who he had assisted more than a decade ago.</p><p>\"I love him like a brother,\" said Lt. Col. Sabroski, who is now retired from the military and lives in Alaska. Lt. Col. Sabroski worked behind the scenes to find out who could let his former interpreter get through. He ended up on the phone with one Afghan soldier who was manning the gate.</p><p>\"Look, this is who I am. I am, you know, Colonel Sabroski, United States Air Force. I worked with him. He needs to get through the gate,\" the retired officer recalled telling the Afghan soldier.</p><p>Mohammad made it onto a flight bound for Doha, Qatar, with his wife, children, mother and sister.</p><p>Write to Elizabeth Findell at Elizabeth.Findell@wsj.com</p><p>Afghans Fleeing Taliban Grow More Desperate as Clock Ticks on U.S. Evacuation</p>",
