  "title": "Don't Expect Big Consumer Brands to Lower Prices Soon; Coca-Cola, Unilever and Kimberly-Clark say price increases helped them cover cost inflation, but they are watching how consumers respond",
  "text": "<p>\"We continue to see resilience and a lot of demand not just in the U.S. but across the world,\" said John Murphy, Coca-Cola Co.'s finance chief. Some consumers are willing, Coca-Cola said, to spend now after missing out on dining out and entertainment during the pandemic.</p><p>Coca-Cola said its average prices increased 12% in the latest quarter. Unilever PLC, whose products include Dove shampoo and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, said prices rose 11.2% across its portfolio. Kimberly-Clark Corp., which makes Huggies and Cottonelle toilet paper, said its net selling prices rose 9%.</p><p>Such price increases are a key reason that official measures of inflation in the U.S. are hovering near historic highs and the Federal Reserve is expected this week to raise interest rates again as the central bank tries to slow demand and stabilize prices. U.S. consumer inflation accelerated to 9.1% in June, a pace not seen in more than four decades.</p><p>Some companies are already warning of a consumer pullback. The makers of Whirlpool Corp. appliances and Weber Inc. grills said this week that weaker demand for key products hurt their financial results.</p><p>The country's biggest retailer by sales, Walmart Inc., said that higher costs for fuel and food were causing consumers to taper spending on merchandise, such as apparel. The Monday report from Walmart, which also cut its profit outlook, sparked a selloff in retail stocks and revealed cracks in the strong spending that has powered the U.S. economy through the pandemic.</p><p>Consumer behavior is shifting in other ways. Unilever, in some parts of the world, and grocery-store chain Albertsons Cos. said they were seeing signs that consumers were moving more spending to generic store brands, which generally cost less. Unilever's volumes slipped 2.1% in the quarter. But executives said they were sticking with plans to push up prices.</p><p>\"We are pricing ahead of the market, and we're prepared to tolerate low-single-digit volume declines and some compromise on competitiveness for a limited period of time in order to land that price,\" said Unilever Chief Executive Alan Jope.</p><p>Likewise, Kimberly-Clark said consumers and businesses paid more for products but cut back on how much they bought. Sales volumes fell 1% for the quarter. The company raised revenue expectations for the calendar year, but predicted that higher costs for everything from pulp to shipping will eat into profitability more than anticipated.</p><p>Executives said they told retailers last week of another round of price hikes, with the percentage increase in the mid-single digits, that, coupled with cost-cutting, should offset higher costs for the rest of the year.</p><p>\"There is a segment of consumers who are trading down, but it's not all consumers,\" Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said. The company, he said, faces a tough balancing act in making budget-conscious offerings available without pushing consumers toward cheaper alternatives. \"We want to be very cognizant that we don't move the whole market that way. There are plenty of consumers that, despite the impact of the economy…they are still looking to trade up.\"</p><p>McDonald's Corp. executives said lower-income customers are trading down more of their purchases to value offerings and fewer combo meals. The company said it is also gaining consumers who are opting to move away from sit-down and fast-casual restaurants, even as the burger chain has been raising prices.</p><p>The company said in April that its U.S. locations had increased menu prices by an average of 8% in the first quarter, compared with last year's period. Some McDonald's owners have dropped its U.S. deal offering soda and other cold beverages of any size for $1 despite the company's recommendations to keep them.</p><p>\"It is a challenging situation,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said. On Tuesday, McDonald's said higher prices and value menu offerings pushed second-quarter same-store sales up 3.7% in the U.S. compared with the year-earlier period. Higher labor and commodity costs squeezed profit.</p><p>U.S. unemployment is low, wages have been rising and many consumers by various measures remain flush. Executives at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said this month that consumers continued to spend despite rising inflation. Spending on Chase credit cards rose 21% in the second quarter from a year ago. That growth included spending on travel and dining.</p><p>However, consumer sentiment in June fell to its lowest level on record and there are signs of strain on household budgets. The U.S. personal-savings rate is hovering near levels last seen more than a decade ago. AT&amp;T Inc. cautioned last week that its customers were on average two days slower to pay their monthly phone and internet bills.</p><p>Customers are buying cheaper rice, beans, oils and other products, often purchasing the grocer's store brands, said Vivek Sankaran, CEO of Albertsons. Some consumers are looking for value but still are willing to spend on items that they care about, he said.</p><p>Private-label store brands have also gained ground in European countries such as Spain, Italy, the U.K. and Germany across food, ice cream and household-cleaning products and in the U.S. across food and ice cream, Unilever's finance chief, Graeme Pitkethly, said Tuesday.</p><p>\"We expect peak inflation to come in the second half of the year,\" Mr. Pitkethly said. He added that Unilever's price hikes have lagged behind cost increases through the first half of the year.</p><p>Investors will get further updates on the health of consumers this week as companies, including snacks giant Mondelez International Inc., Visa Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., release their quarterly financial reports.</p><p>—Heather Haddon, Saabira Chaudhuri, Sharon Terlep and Jaewon Kang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com</p><p>Don't Expect Big Consumer Brands to Lower Prices Soon</p>",
