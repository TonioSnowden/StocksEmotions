  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The State Department's internal watchdog has informed U.S. lawmakers that it has begun to investigate policy planning behind the suspension of operations at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan, leading up to the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August. </p><p>   The department's Office of the Inspector General will review the State Department's Special Immigrant Visa program for Afghanistan, its processing and resettlement of refugees for admissions into the U.S., and the emergency evacuation of U.S. citizens and Afghan nationals, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   On Aug. 12, the U.S. announced that it would temporarily deploy thousands of troops to the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan to evacuate personnel from the embassy in Kabul, cutting the size of the diplomatic presence as the Taliban advanced toward the Afghan capital. </p><p>   The U.S. troop drawdown turned into an emergency evacuation mission for the U.S. and many of its foreign partners based in Afghanistan, as well as Afghans who served those governments, as the Taliban rolled into Kabul on Aug. 15. </p><p>   The review represents at least the second agency probe into the Afghan withdrawal. The Pentagon is investigating an Aug. 29 drone strike that mistakenly killed 10 civilians. </p><p></p>",
