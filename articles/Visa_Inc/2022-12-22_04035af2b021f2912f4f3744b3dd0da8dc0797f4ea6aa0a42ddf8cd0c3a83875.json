  "title": "The $25 Gift Card Rules Christmas in a Year of Inflation; Gift cards can seem impersonal. But this holiday season, purchasing power is on top of many wish lists.",
  "text": "<p>Consumers intended to spend 7% more on gift cards this year than last, according to Deloitte's annual holiday shopping survey of 5,000 respondents in September. All other spending categories were down year-over-year.</p><p>Rod Sides, who runs Deloitte Insights, says the firm also saw holiday gift-card spending rise during the downturn of 2007 and 2008. \"As a gift giver, it allows me to control my budget much more easily, versus a sweater. You don't know if it's going to be $25 or $45,\" Mr. Sides says.</p><p>Sam Lockwood usually spends about $300 in total on gifts for his brothers, parents, grandparents and cousins. Not this year. The New York City corporate communications account executive recently moved out of his parents' house, and says he needs to put more of that money toward his $1,800 monthly rent in Midtown.</p><p>To keep his budget under $200, he's getting everyone a $25 gift card to one of their favorite spots. The 22-year-old also likes that he doesn't have to expose himself to any of the winter viruses circulating by spending hours browsing the aisles at Target. Not having to wrap gifts is a plus, too. (The cost of wrapping paper and stationery is up 14% year-over-year, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index.)</p><p>\"This is my new normal,\" Mr. Lockwood says.</p><p>To prevent the presents from feeling generic, he's tailoring the gift card type to the recipient. His brother, for example, is getting $25 to his favorite restaurant chain, Raising Cane's.</p><p>With the cost of dining out up 18% since March 2020, according to the CPI, more people are taking Mr. Lockwood's lead.</p><p>The National Retail Federation found in a November survey of about 8,000 consumers that this year holiday shoppers are most likely to purchase a gift card for a restaurant (27%), department store (26%) or a bank-issued gift card (25%). Another 10% plan to purchase gift cards for food-delivery services such as DoorDash or UberEats. The NRF expects total gift-card spending to reach $28.6 billion, compared with $28.1 billion in 2021.</p><p>Starbucks Corp. alone expects to sell 58 million gift cards in the U.S. and Canada this holiday season, compared with 55 million in 2021 and 46 million in 2020, according to a company spokeswoman.</p><p>Holly Kailani is giving everyone in her family gift cards for the first time this year, not necessarily because she wants to, but because they asked.</p><p>The Los Angeles property manager, 54, says she misses when her two daughters were little and would be happy with anything she got them. These days, the 20-somethings would rather get Visa gift cards to decide for themselves where to splurge and where to save.</p><p>\"It's very difficult to figure out with the trends what they actually like, and trying to do the returns is a pain in the butt,\" Ms. Kailani says. She adds that gift cards help ensure she's spending equally on everyone.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>When are gift cards a good option? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Still, she worries about part of a gift card going unused when a purchase doesn't quite meet the threshold. (She calls stuffing cash in an envelope a bridge too far.) Her concern isn't unjustified: About a third of gift-card value is never spent, electronic payments company Square says.</p><p>Ms. Kailani is still buying stocking stuffers to give everyone something to open Christmas morning, and says she has been shocked at how much those small items have cost her this yearâ€”an extra $200 or so.</p><p>Her daughter, 25-year-old Summer Kailani, is just happy to get a little help with the cost of living.</p><p>\"My main ask in getting them is being able to cover essentials,\" she says. \"It would be nice to have the option of, if my essentials are covered, going out to a nicer dinner with my boyfriend.\"</p><p>This year is also different in how much people are loading onto each card.</p><p>Paytronix, a loyalty platform for restaurants, retail chains and convenience stores, is seeing people gravitate toward smaller values of $25 or $50, instead of loading higher amounts like they did in the past.</p><p>\"It suggests to us that cards are acting as a recession-proof gift,\" says Lee Barnes, chief data officer at the company, of how people are using gift cards to keep themselves from overspending.</p><p>\"That is, if I'm going to spend $50 on my brother-in-law, I may as well give him a gift card rather than get him that T-shirt I had been planning, which now may cost more.\"</p><p>Write to Rachel Wolfe at rachel.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>The $25 Gift Card Rules Christmas in a Year of Inflation</p>",
