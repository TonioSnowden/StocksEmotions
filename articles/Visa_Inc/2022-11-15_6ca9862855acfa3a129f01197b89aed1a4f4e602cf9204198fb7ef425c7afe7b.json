  "text": "<p>Australia no longer requires travelers to the country to provide evidence of being vaccinated against Covid-19, having progressively rolled back restrictions this year as it shifted toward treating the coronavirus as endemic. The election of the center-left Labor Party in May also meant those government officials who opposed Djokovic's entry no longer hold power.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Tennis Australia said the governing body for the sport in the country was awaiting official advice on the matter. The 2023 Australian Open is due to take place Jan. 16-29 in Melbourne.</p><p>Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open champion, wasn't immediately available for comment. The Serb's admission to Australia would make him an immediate favorite to win the tournament and claim his 22nd major title, bringing him level with Rafael Nadal for the all-time men's record.</p><p>Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after a court upheld a decision by then-Immigration Minister Alex Hawke to cancel his visa, citing public interest.</p><p>The tennis star had been denied entry at the border as the country faced a surge in cases of Covid-19, which officials had successfully contained for much of the pandemic largely by restricting travel. At the time, Australia didn't allow unvaccinated travelers into the country and authorities said Djokovic's visa wasn't covered by an exemption.</p><p>Mr. Hawke said that letting the tennis star stay in Australia could stoke antivaccine sentiment. The country of 26 million people had one of the highest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the world and officials were urging as many people as possible to get vaccinated as Australia moved from suppressing the virus to living with it.</p><p>The unvaccinated Djokovic, who was then the world's No. 1 ranked men's tennis player and reigning Australian Open champion, said at the time he believed he had an exemption from rules requiring travelers to the country to have received two shots of a Covid-19 vaccine because he had recovered from the virus not long before.</p><p>Djokovic spent 11 days in the country, mostly in a shabby Australian hotel room, in what became an international incident. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused Australia of harassing one of the most famous athletes on the planet.</p><p>Djokovic also didn't play in this year's U.S. Open because of certain rules about admitting noncitizens unvaccinated against Covid-19, although he did claim his seventh title at Wimbledon in July.</p><p>â€”Joshua Robinson contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com</p><p>Novak Djokovic Set for Australian Open Return After Visa Ban Overturned</p>",
