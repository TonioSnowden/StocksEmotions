  "text": "<p>But IPOs for venture-backed companies generated a negative 19% return from offer, worse than the average return for all IPOs this year, and way below the 25% positive return for the S&amp;P 500, according to Renaissance Capital.</p><p>Some of the laggards among the largest venture-backed public listings are Robinhood Markets Inc., down more than 48% from its IPO; Coupang, down around 23%; and Bumble, down more than 18%, as of Wednesday.</p><p>Only about a third of all IPOs this year have been trading above issue price as of mid-December, the research firm showed.</p><p>Should this recalibration continue, propped up by inflation and Omicron-variant concerns, VCs will return less than they might have hoped from the IPOs of their portfolio companies.

Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.) sit on the powerful Senate Banking Committee. (WSJ)</p><p>Republican SEC Commissioner Roisman to Leave Agency</p><p>Securities and Exchange Commission member Elad Roisman plans to leave the market regulator by the end of January, giving Democrats a bigger majority at an agency pursuing an ambitious and sometimes politically divisive policy agenda, WSJ reports. Mr. Roisman joined the five-member SEC as a Republican commissioner in September 2018, having served as chief counsel for Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee before that. He briefly served as the SEC's acting chairman at the end of the Trump administration. With Mr. Roisman's departure, the SEC will have three Democrats, including Chairman Gary Gensler, and one Republican member. The move isn't expected to change Mr. Gensler's ability to advance his policy priorities, since Democrats already had the majority.</p><p>Coming to Terms: Private-Equity Investors Face Rising Costs, Extra Fees</p><p>Private equity has long been among the most expensive asset classes for investors, and it's not getting any cheaper.
