  "text": "<p>Here's what you need to know about the potential issuance of a U.S. central bank digital currency.</p><p>What is a government-issued digital currency?</p><p>A U.S. digital currency would be a type of digital dollar issued by the government. Unlike private crypto assets such as stablecoins, it would be issued by and backed by the Fed, a government entity, as are U.S. paper dollar bills.</p><p>In theory, a Fed digital dollar could be used alongside traditional paper money, but many of the details of how exactly people would access digital dollars, and how they would fit into the financial system, are unclear. For instance, the Fed would have to decide whether consumers would access their digital dollars with accounts directly at the central bank or through existing private-sector banks.</p><p>Why would the U.S. want that?</p><p>Advocates say a Fed digital dollar could make it faster and cheaper to move money around the financial system, bring into it people who lack bank accounts and provide an efficient way for the government to distribute financial aid.</p><p>Some advocates say such digital currency could help improve the effectiveness of monetary policy by allowing a central bank to change interest rates directly on accounts holding the government currency. This could allow central banks to bypass often fickle financial markets and bring monetary policy to the retail level.</p><p>Another motivating consideration: keeping up with other countries considering a digital currency for domestic and international payments. The U.S. may not want to see China, for example, creating a rival international financial network to the U.S. dollar via its digital currency.</p><p>What is the risk?</p><p>There are several challenges to the issuance of a digital dollar, including the fact that many Americans actively use and prefer cash.Privacy issues would need to be addressed, since a Fed digital currency system would in theory allow the central bank to see what every user did with the currency.</p><p>A Philadelphia Fed report warned that a U.S. central bank digital currency could destabilize the financial system in a crisis if people pull their money out of banks, mutual funds, stocks and other investments and plow the funds into the Fed's ultrasafe currency.</p><p>Some banks—facing the prospect of competition from the Fed for deposits—have already signaled they don't believe the central bank has the legal authority to issue a digital currency without authorization from Congress.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated he sees reason for caution, saying it is more important to get the digital dollar right than to be first to market, in part because of the dollar's critical global role.</p><p>Have other countries done it?</p><p>China created its own government-issued digital currency in 2021 and recently prohibited transactions using cryptocurrencies issued by nonmonetary authorities, naming bitcoin, ether and tether as examples. El Salvador, meanwhile, became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as a national currency alongside the U.S. dollar.</p><p>How would it be different than privately issued stablecoins?</p><p>Some cryptocurrency companies issue stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to national currencies such as the U.S. dollar. The Biden administration is in the early stages of considering ways to impose banklike regulation on the those assets, which some officials fear could fuel financial panics and need to be more tightly regulated. A U.S. digital currency would be directly issued by the government.</p><p>Mr. Powell told lawmakers in January that a U.S. digital dollar could compete alongside stablecoins.</p><p>What is the advantage to consumers?</p><p>Depending upon how a digital dollar was constructed, there could be several advantages. For consumers with bank accounts who are used to Venmo and other digital payment services, the difference wouldn't be very noticeable.</p><p>For consumers without bank accounts, however, it would offer the convenience of digital payments without the costs of maintaining a bank account. For example, somebody who didn't have a bank account could get paid in a digital currency and not have to go to a check-cashing store to convert a paycheck into cash.</p><p>For merchants, it would likely have an advantage over credit cards as a payment system. The money would arrive almost instantly in the merchant's accounts and they wouldn't have to pay the fees to use Visa or MasterCard's networks.</p><p>Ostensibly, a digital dollar is more secure than a bank account, assuming it were issued by and a liability of the central bank. Effectively, since most accounts have deposit insurance, this isn't much of a practical advantage.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>— Paul Vigna contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Should the U.S. Issue a Digital Dollar, Which Could Compete With Crypto Assets?</p>",
