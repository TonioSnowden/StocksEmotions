  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- American universities and research institutes say U.S. dominance in science and technology could be undermined by toughened U.S. visa requirements that are squeezing the flow of talent from China. </p><p>   The tighter rules are slowing down work at research labs like the one run by Christo Wilson, an associate professor of computer science at Northeastern University in Boston, who studies how algorithms used by internet companies can reinforce biases or lead to price discrimination. </p><p>   One of Mr. Wilson's doctoral students, a Chinese citizen named Dennis Hu, flew home in 2020 to celebrate Lunar New Year with his family in Shanghai and has been stuck outside the U.S. ever since -- first because of pandemic-related travel bans and more recently for fear of being caught up in the enforcement of a presidential proclamation signed by then-President Donald Trump  in May 2020. </p><p>   The order bars entry to the U.S. for Chinese graduate students and postgraduate researchers with ties to any Chinese entity \"that implements or supports China's 'military-civil fusion strategy,' \" referring to enterprises that meld economic and military interests. </p><p>   In practice, this has meant Chinese nationals who have studied at the so-called Seven Sons of National Defense -- universities with close ties to China's defense industry -- have found it all but impossible to obtain visas, said a group of more than 500 Chinese students who banded together after their visas were rejected this year. Last year, more than 1,000 Chinese nationals had their visas revoked over similar concerns, according to data provided by the U.S. State Department. </p><p>   \"It takes a long time of training and a high level of very specific expertise to run some of these labor-intensive experiments,\" Mr. Wilson said, explaining why he couldn't delegate Mr. Hu's tasks to other doctoral students. </p><p>   \"The ban has turned my life upside down,\" said Mr. Hu, who studied computer science as an undergraduate at one of the Seven Sons, Northwestern Polytechnical University in the central Chinese city of Xi'an. </p><p>   Defenders of the tighter rules say they are necessary to defend the U.S. against Chinese espionage. FBI Director Christopher Wray includes students among the \"nontraditional collectors\" he accuses China of deploying to pilfer American intellectual property. </p><p>   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing calls the policy targeted, saying \"a tiny percentage\" of all Chinese student applications, which include those applying for undergraduate degrees, are affected by Mr. Trump's order. </p><p>   Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, however, estimates that the proclamation could be used to block up to 5,000 students, or roughly one-quarter of all Chinese science, technology, engineering and math graduates who would otherwise have headed to the U.S. each year. </p><p>   China's government seized on the policy to warn of its chilling effect on other prospective students from China. It \"will finally cast a shadow on American higher-education institutions,\" the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said, adding that the U.S. was using national security as an excuse to infringe on Chinese citizens' rights. </p><p>   The policy and its potential for collateral damage highlight the trade-offs the U.S. faces as it tries to confront Chinese government espionage aimed at stealing American technology to bolster the country's military. </p><p>   Randy Katz, vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Berkeley, said it makes sense for federal agencies to keep an eye out for national security threats. But he criticized the current approach as self-defeating. </p><p>   Mr. Hu, whose first major academic paper in 2019 explored how Google searches amplified partisanship and ways to address the bias, has begun to think about non-U.S. options after his graduation. \"I thought I was studying something that could make the U.S. a better place. But I guess that's not good enough,\" he said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Lekai Liu contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
