Traders are also bracing for a consumer-prices report on Wednesday that could show a 7% headline year-over-year rise that won't let up for months. Deutsche Bank AG DB researchers now say that the Federal Reserve has fallen “way behind the curve,” and they see the possibility that policy makers might need to consider hiking interest rates at almost every meeting in 2022. Read: Almost every Federal Reserve meeting in 2022 could be potentially `at play' for a potential rate hike, Deutsche Bank saysEconomists at Deutsche Bank expect four hikes in 2022 starting in March, roughly in line with the market's expectations, the researchers wrote in a Monday note. They also foresee the reduction of the Fed's more than $8 trillion balance sheet beginning in the third quarter, or after two rate hikes are delivered. But “unless financial conditions notably tighten then all seven meetings from March to the end of 2022 are now potentially in play,”&#xa0;Jim Reid, head of thematic research, and others wrote.Meanwhile, economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS also expect four rate increases in 2022, versus a previous call for three, and a balance-sheet runoff that begins in the third quarter, as early as July. “Declining labor market slack has made Fed officials more sensitive to upside inflation risks and less sensitive to downside growth risks,” they said in a note to clients.Friday's labor report came in at 199,000 jobs in December, worse than forecast, but it also showed a decline in the unemployment rate to a pandemic low and a rise in wages.&#xa0;The labor-market reading came after Fed minutes released last Wednesday signaled that policy makers are eager to tighten financial policy to battle inflation, with market-based projections pointing to at least three interest-rate increases this year.</p><p>Read: Jekyll-and-Hyde U.S. jobs report not as ugly as it looks</p><p>Some analysts are adopting a much more sanguine view of the market's outlook, despite the eminent tightening of financial conditions. In a Monday note, BlackRock Investment Institute's global chief investment strategist, Wei Li, and others said that although central banks will move away from emergency stimulus, they won't necessarily “hit the brakes by raising rates to restrictive levels.” In addition, the three rate hikes being penciled in by policy makers for this year is “more than we expected.” “We prefer equities and would use COVID-related selloffs to add to risk,” they wrote.</p><p>Later in the week, investors will watch the confirmation hearing of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, followed by one for Lael Brainard, the Fed governor who has been nominated to become the central bank's No. 2 after Vice Chairman Richard Clarida steps down. A report on U.S. retail sales is due on Friday.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Lululemon AthleticaLULU warned fourth-quarter earnings and revenue would be at the low end of its target, citing the impact of the omicron variant on capacity and staff. Shares fell 6.1%.</p><p>Shares of Take-Two Interactive SoftwareTTWO were in focus after it said it would acquire ZyngaZNGA in a deal with enterprise value of $12.7 billion. The company intends to pay $3.50 in cash and $6.36 in Take-Two shares for each share of Zynga. Take-Two shares dropped 16%, while Zynga shares soared 41%.</p><p>Popular meme stock GameStop Corp.'s shares GME were down almost 11% after outperforming some of its competitors on Friday.</p><p>Visa Inc. V shares slipped 3% after Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev downgraded the company's shares to neutral from buy on Friday. Dolev said that COVID-19 has sped up the move away from cash, but “dramatically and likely permanently shortened the cash-to-card conversion runway” — giving Visa possibly fewer opportunities for revenue growth going forward.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.78%, following the&#xa0;biggest weekly gain&#xa0;since September 2019 based on 3 p.m. Eastern Time levels, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
