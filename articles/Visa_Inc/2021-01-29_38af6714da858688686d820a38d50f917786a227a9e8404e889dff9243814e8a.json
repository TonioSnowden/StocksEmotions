  "title": "They Haven't Missed a Super Bowl. They Won't Stop Now. --- A pandemic nearly halts a streak for a select club of super fans. They are planning to be in Tampa.",
  "text": "<p>The ongoing pandemic presented too many complications for the 84-year-old. There were Crisman's own concerns, the concerns of his family, the travel from his home in Kennebunk, Maine, to Tampa, Fla., and the biggest challenge: limited tickets. The NFL had yet to finalize its plan for Super Bowl LV, but it was going to be a smaller crowd. Even if Crisman got to Tampa, he wasn't sure he'd get inside.</p><p>Missing the game was no small thing. Crisman had gone to the first Super Bowl, back before they called it a Super Bowl, when tickets cost $12 and the Packers beat the Chiefs behind two touchdown passes by Bart Starr. He'd gone to the next one, and the one after that, in Miami, when Joe Namath guaranteed a Jets victory over the Colts, and made good. Crisman had been there for the Chuck Noll Steelers, the Joe Montana and Steve Young 49ers, and when Tom Brady and Crisman's beloved Patriots stormed back from 28-3 to beat the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI.</p><p>He was 54 of 54, which made him part of a very select group, which was called the \"Never Miss a Super Bowl\" club. But No. 55, on Feb. 7, was in flux. Crisman sounded resigned to watching on TV for the first time in his life.</p><p>\"It has to end sometime,\" he said. \"It's a game.\"</p><p>The next time I talked to Crisman, in the third week of January, he sounded ready to spike a Wilson in the end zone. The NFL had come through with an offer to buy tickets at face value -- this was the usual arrangement for the Never Missers, except for Super Bowl 50, when the NFL comped the group. Crisman planned to be there for the Chiefs vs. Buccaneers. He would bring his daughter, Sue.</p><p>He was also getting his first vaccine shot.</p><p>\"I'm high on the hog right now,\" Crisman said. \"Things are looking up.\"</p><p>It had been a roller coaster month for this very small handful of NFL fans. Besides Crisman's \"Never Miss\" trio, which includes Gregory Eaton, and Tom Henschel, there's the \"Super Bowl Five\" of Sylvan Schefler, Harvey Rothenberg, Lew Rapaport, and Larry McDonald, now a group of four, after the 2018 death of charter member Al Schragis.</p><p>Until a few weeks ago, these streaks had been in doubt. Now it's all happening. Rapaport, 83, told me he'd be a game-day decision -- \"They'll look at me before the game, and see if I'm off the IR,\" he joked -- but the rest intended to see Pat Mahomes square off against that youngster, Tom Brady.</p><p>\"Our 55th,\" Rothenberg told me. \"I can't believe it.\" He'd gotten his first vaccination shot, and he'd have the second shot completed before the game.</p><p>Schefler, too, had gotten his first shot. He sounded thrilled that Super Bowl LV was becoming a reality. The game was the game, and sometimes it was a great one, especially if Schefler's beloved Giants were involved, but the Super Bowl Five was an experience rooted in a long friendship.</p><p>That's what Schefler, 82, looked forward to the most.</p><p>\"This is all about these friends, who never miss this opportunity,\" he said.</p><p>Schefler's wife, Joan, acknowledged that maintaining a Super Bowl streak in 2021 was a complex endeavor. The pandemic is no means over. \"Obviously, I have concerns,\" she said. But she understood why her husband felt drawn to go.</p><p>\"It's tradition,\" she said. \"It really does mean something to people.\"</p><p>Precautions are being taken. Trips will be much shorter. The entire Super Bowl experience is being reduced for LV; even the Chiefs are staying away until a couple of days before. A few of the super fans live in Florida -- Tom Henschel is right there in Tampa -- and they'll be able to take a car to the game. Larry McDonald intends to drive from his home outside of Atlanta.</p><p>Road trip in a Winnebago? McDonald laughed. \"No Winnebago. I'm 86. My Winnebago days are over.\"</p><p>Schefler, who lives in New York, intends to quarantine from his family upon his return. Everyone said they intend to follow the NFL rules on masking and social distancing.</p><p>\"I'm hopefully protected with the vaccinations, and I feel comfortable,\" said Rothenberg, who is 87. \"But I'm still going to wear a mask and go through the protocol of trying to be 6 feet away from everybody.\"</p><p>Crisman's daughter, Sue Metevier, said she'd been \"at peace\" with the idea of the pandemic winding down her father's Super Bowl streak. But when the tickets came through, she and her family got behind her father's wishes.</p><p>\"He really wants to be there and see his friends,\" said Metevier.</p><p>Schefler's daughter, Nikki Silver, offered similar support. \"I'm sure there are some people who say it's just a sporting event, but for my dad, Uncle Harvey and the whole team, it's much more than that,\" Silver said. Her son, Justin, planned to accompany his grandfather to Tampa.</p><p>Talking to these Super Bowl super fans is a delight. They've got their favorite games, favorite halftime acts, favorite restaurants for the night before, and can trace the game from its modest origins ($12 seats!) to its modern state as a megaevent, where tickets sell for thousands.</p><p>\"To me, going to the Super Bowl is like Fourth of July and New Year's put together,\" said Henschel, who is 79. He grew up in Pittsburgh, and has fond memories of the 1970s Steelers juggernaut, and Pittsburgh's last title, over Arizona in 2009, which happened in Tampa.</p><p>Gregory Eaton, originally from Lansing, Mich., recalls having to stay at a Black hotel while attending Super Bowl III -- which put special significance on Super Bowl XXII, when Black quarterback Doug Williams won the game's MVP, and Super Bowl XLI, which had two Black coaches, Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith.</p><p>\"That's the change I recognize, over the years,\" said Eaton, 81.</p><p>These are men with extensive families, careers and hobbies. But their Super Bowl streaks have brought them a different kind of fame. In 2010, the \"Never Miss\" club was featured in a Visa ad narrated by Morgan Freeman. At Super Bowl 50, the \"Super Bowl Five\" sat with \"Today\" host Savannah Guthrie for a story.</p><p>\"Yesterday I was buying something somewhere, and somebody stopped me and said, \"Aren't you one of the Super Bowl Five?'\" said Schefler. \"It happens a lot.\"</p><p>Now it will keep happening. The streak is intact. I asked Don Crisman how he felt.</p><p>\"Elated,\" he said.</p>",
