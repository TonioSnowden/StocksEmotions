  "title": "Bitcoin Stalls as Investors Move  To Other Areas of Crypto Market  ----  By Paul Vigna",
  "text": "<p>   The late summer lull that overtakes Wall Street is even making bitcoin drowsy. </p><p>   Bitcoin's price stalled right at $50,000 during its August rally. On Wednesday, the cryptocurrency settled at $48,279.42, before briefly crossing $50,000 on Thursday. At 5 p.m. it traded at $49,555.55. </p><p>   Bitcoin is renowned for its volatility. It more than doubled from January through mid-April, falling about 52% in the next three months and bouncing about 65% from July to August. </p><p>   So what is keeping bitcoin treading water now? For one, investors are moving to other corners of the crypto market. </p><p>   Ethereum funds had inflows of $22.4 million in August, according to CoinShares. And funds focused on Cardano -- a blockchain platform similar to Ethereum -- had inflows of $18.7 million. On Wednesday, Ethereum rose 10% to $3,730, its highest level since May 15. It has quintupled so far this year. </p><p>   Nonfungible tokens spiked in the spring and are surging now, drawing money away from bitcoin. NFTs are digital assets similar to bitcoin, with the difference that each is unique. </p><p>   On OpenSea, the biggest exchange for NFTs, trading volume has been $3.5 billion over the past 30 days, according to data from research site DappRadar. Before August, it had a total of about $1 billion in trading volume since its founding in 2016. </p><p>   Also, recently, two blue-chip U.S. companies -- Visa Inc. and Facebook Inc. -- both took a step into the NFT market. Visa purchased a \"CryptoPunks\" NFT, and Facebook said it is considering building services for NFTs in its coming digital wallet service. </p><p>   That is the kind of big-name news that used to drive bitcoin, and it might need to recapture those kinds of headlines to rebuild its momentum. </p><p>   Bitcoin's August's rally didn't attract many new buyers. The cryptocurrency's funds had outflows of $61 million in August, according to data from asset manager CoinShares, and outflows in 14 of the past 16 weeks. </p><p>   In a note, Bret Oliver, an analyst at Momentum Structural Analysis, wrote that bitcoin's trading pattern since its April high resembles what happened after the 2017 peak. </p><p>   In 2017, the price reached about $20,000, fell sharply over the next three months and then spent more than a year in an extended downturn before the next rally started. </p><p>   This downturn doesn't necessarily have to last as long as the last one, he said, but he expects the market will be stuck in a range after this year's selloff before building a new base. </p><p></p>",
