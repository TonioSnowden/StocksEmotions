  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>We are living in a moment when even seemingly the most secure of diarised events evaporate: last week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93daf530-14c1-4877-8d59-d4f184fec0d6\">Chinese GDP announcement</a> being a prime example (now due this week) and of course anything to do with the UK government.</p> <p>Talking of the UK political news diary, since Liz Truss became PM in early September we have been on a cycle of significant shocks happening at the end of the week — the “mini” Budget, and the sacking of chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng being two examples. Now she's gone, the trend may well continue. One thing is for certain, we <a href=\"https://next-media-api.ft.com/renditions/16662706264340/1280x720.mp4\">will have a successor</a> by Friday. </p> <p>The FT's team of parliamentary pundits will be on hand to guide you through these next few days, notably Stephen Bush of the Inside Politics newsletter — <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=56b0ba3c51eb850300eb5d43\">sign up here</a> if you haven't already. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/178a016c-260f-4615-b405-3d7913159984\">Read this one</a> for a clear outline of the process and why a Sunak vs Boris contest is the most likely outcome on Monday. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4091dcc0-ba9f-48cd-8568-d4bd791608af\">Read this also</a> to learn more about who is more likely to unite the party. </p> <p>By the way, this Friday also happens to be the western church's feast day of St Jude, patron saint of lost causes. Just saying.</p> <p>It is not just seemingly secure economic and political diary items that can be torn out of the schedule at a moment's notice. Court hearings are often postponed. With that proviso, Monday is the date set for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55108399-f70f-4e48-92fc-3e9cf7039143\">criminal trial</a> of former US president Donald Trump's family company over tax fraud charges brought by Manhattan's district attorney to begin in a New York courtroom. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03bea5ec-e5ed-4528-ada9-fc6fad51bec5\">Read this</a> for a full briefing on the case.</p> <p>One thing that will be decided this week — having <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc6ac1a7-5c3b-4e81-97c6-7ce586953d8c\">almost been decided</a> earlier this month — is the election of Brazil's next president. The second round of voting takes place on Sunday, after an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9024b087-8f18-4544-9f16-e8eb8aaac1ee\">ugly contest</a>. Of course, both of the candidates have done this job before. And whoever wins will face enormous economic and social challenges in a country <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/ac8c3bec-9831-4742-94aa-11736ddd108c\">polarised politically</a>.</p> <p>As ever, thank you for your comments about this newsletter.

Is it ever thus in this year of disruption?</p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong>, now battling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a7d5bba-4355-4e4c-9f2a-d42b2298fed3\">record high double-digit inflation</a> in the eurozone, will announce its next monetary policy move on Thursday with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcade33b-969e-4fb3-bd0a-192425112b4a\">expectations high</a> for a 75 basis point increase. Earlier that day the <strong>Bank of Japan's</strong> rate-setting committee begins its two-day meeting with the country's ultra-loose policy expected to be maintained.</p> <p>There will be another chance for speculation about the US Federal Reserve's next rate move with an updated estimate of <strong>third-quarter GDP</strong> growth in the US indicating whether recession has become more or less likely in the coming months. <strong>Germany</strong>, where there are growing concerns that the country is already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/117f3121-0738-4ee4-9e72-375ab3794565#post-aba85b00-3654-440e-b9c1-12de558ad92e\">tipping into recession</a>, will also update its quarterly GDP estimate.</p> <p>The <strong>purchasing managers' index</strong> (PMI) reports on Monday will allow us some international comparisons, and provide probably the most significant economic data for the UK of this week.</p> <p>There are unemployment and inflation rate updates from Japan, Australia, Italy and Hungary.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>We've reached peak earnings season, again. No trains, but plenty of planes and automobiles this week — BA's parent <strong>International Consolidated Airlines Group</strong>, <strong>Southwest Airlines</strong>, <strong>Ford Motor Company</strong>, <strong>Harley-Davidson</strong>, <strong>Hyundai Motor Company</strong> and <strong>JetBlue Airways</strong> are all reporting. The most obvious linking factor for all these companies is the cost of fuel. But for the airlines, there is also a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1bb444b-7e0d-4ff5-83b5-c2f6f4e52ab0\">problem getting the planes</a>, according to my colleagues.</p> <p>Big Tech will be out in force too with earnings updates from <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Alphabet</strong>, <strong>Meta</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>. </p> <p>It is the best of times and worst of times for British banks. Rising interest rates are helping the bottom line of <strong>HSBC</strong>, <strong>Barclays</strong>, <strong>NatWest</strong> and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group,</strong> but that has also made them a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80a96b98-a64e-46ac-be30-cd5695d7c1f3\">windfall tax target</a> for a UK government desperate to fill a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/147e9952-33db-4ce8-9a12-96065641860e\">£40bn fiscal spending hole</a>. There are specific challenges. With regards to HSBC, Jonathan Pierce at Numis says: “The main focus may be capital, which could fall well below target given a combination of the France disposal and rate related headwind”.</p> <p>Given the Brazilian elections taking place this week, it is also worth mentioning that the country's most valuable listed company,<strong> Petrobras</strong>, will give a production and sales update on Monday. What's next for the energy company? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d379f8be-e61e-4e39-986c-f8d3bdbf8e75\">Ask our man in São Paulo</a>, Michael Pooler.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Eurozone, France, Germany, Japan, UK, US: S&amp;P Global/Sips flash composite (manufacturing and services) purchasing managers' index (PMI) data</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Heidrick &amp;
