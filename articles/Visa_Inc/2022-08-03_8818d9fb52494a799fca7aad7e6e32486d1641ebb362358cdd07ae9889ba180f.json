  "title": "Winners and Losers From Card-Fee Proposal Are Hard to Figure; Fallout of a plan to introduce competition to credit-card networks could be complex",
  "text": "<p>Should the nascent bill become law and work as intended, it could affect a number of companies throughout the long payments chain: the biggest credit-card networks, Visa and Mastercard, that connect all the payments; the banks that earn the interchange fees for cards they issue and lend through; the merchant acquirers that enable businesses to take card payments, and merchants that offer their own branded cards with rewards.</p><p>But before investors start placing their bets on winners and losers, there are many complexities to consider. Credit is a different animal to debit. Interchange fees for credit are typically higher and often fund rewards paid out to card users. There are also fewer credit networks: Visa and Mastercard are the largest, followed by American Express and Discover, which are also themselves banks that issue cards.</p><p>By contrast, in debit, there are a number of competing networks. A press release from the new bill's co-sponsors, Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said that the law would inject competition, \"opening the door for new market entrants such as current debit-only networks.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What changes should be made to the way credit cards are regulated? Join the conversation below.</p><p>However, there are many complexities in how credit-card networks work, such as with fraud prevention and security, so it is unclear how quickly that might happen. Analyst Ken Suchoski at Autonomous Research wrote in a note that it could be an \"arduous effort…to create a functioning replica of the currently existing credit networks.\"</p><p>The law would mandate that banks above a certain size must allow merchants to choose at least one competing network that banks' Visa or Mastercard credit cards can also run on. Intense competition would be vital to the bill's aims if it doesn't put any caps on credit interchange fees, like the 2010 measure did for many debit cards. Smaller networks might try to compete by offering merchants lower fees, but this would also mean paying less interchange fees to card-issuing partner banks.</p><p>Networks such as Visa and Mastercard set interchange fees, but the fees are ultimately paid to banks—so lower interchange by itself doesn't directly affect networks. They could lose out on some revenue if transactions are routed through other networks. Merchant acquirers could even be possible winners from a world of lower interchange fees, as they might be able to capture at least part of the reduced interchange component of what merchants overall pay for payments.</p><p>Not all merchants would necessarily win. Some large merchants have branded cards with bank partners that offer customer rewards partly funded by interchange fees. They also can cut network deals themselves. Banks will likely argue that reducing their compensation for taking credit and fraud risk, via lower interchange, could shrink the availability of credit. Were that indeed the case, merchants might have to seek new ways to motivate consumers to spend a bit more. Perhaps buy now, pay later players could see an opportunity open up.</p><p>Customers would like cheaper prices at the store. But would they also accept smaller card rewards as part of a trade-off? This could affect groups differently based on their income level: People who don't qualify for expensive rewards cards might benefit, to the extent that merchants pass along fee savings; people who use cards primarily just to earn rewards on balance might not.</p><p>Whatever the future for credit cards might look like under a different system, the transition isn't going to be straightforward—including for investors in the payments space.</p><p>Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com</p><p>Winners and Losers From Card-Fee Proposal Are Hard to Figure</p>",
