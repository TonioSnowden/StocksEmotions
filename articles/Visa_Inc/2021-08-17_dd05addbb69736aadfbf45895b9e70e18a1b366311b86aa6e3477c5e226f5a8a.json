  "title": "Chaos in Afghanistan:  Afghans in U.S. Plead to Save Family Members in Kabul  ----  By Elizabeth Findell, Sara Randazzo and James Fanelli",
  "text": "<p> Desperate and defeated, Naqibullah Laghmanai was calling everyone he could think of Monday morning in Houston, trying to get his family out of Afghanistan. He was on hold with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for at least the 10th time in recent weeks, he said. He was crafting a plea to the Canadian Embassy, though his family never worked for the Canadians. He was calling members of Congress. </p> <p> On Monday, after the Taliban took Kabul, Taliban fighters searched his aunt and uncle's home, looking for the men of the family, his mother told him. </p> <p> \"Their only hope is on me to get them out and I can't,\" Mr. Laghmanai, 31 years old, said of his parents and siblings. </p> <p> Mr. Laghmanai, who worked as an interpreter for U.S. armed forces starting in 2007 in Kandahar, joins other Afghans currently living in America who have spent the past 48 hours feverishly trying to save their family members left behind. </p> <p> Mr. Laghmanai's family in Kabul had already received a threat from the Taliban and had been in hiding for months because, he suspected, of his work for the U.S. government and his father's work for the Afghan government. Special Immigrant Visas for his parents and young siblings have been pending for 15 months, Mr. Laghmanai said. </p> <p> Recipients of such visas fear their family members will be targeted. Mr. Laghmanai came to the U.S. with an S.I.V. in 2013 and is now a U.S. citizen living in Houston with his wife and daughters, where he works for Refugee Services of Texas. His father, a doctor, worked for the Afghan government in clinics alongside U.S. service members. </p> <p> A few months ago, the family in Kabul received a letter from the Taliban referring to Mr. Laghmanai's work for the Americans and threatening his father. The family stopped going out in public and stopped sending its three youngest children, 8, 6 and 5, to school, fearing they could be kidnapped for retribution. This weekend, as the Taliban reached the city's edges, Mr. Laghmanai's mother locked herself at home with the children while his father and teenage brothers went into hiding elsewhere in Kabul. </p> <p> \"I helped the U.S. for reasons, but I didn't mean that it would turn against me and my family,\" Mr. Laghmanai said. \"I'm proud to be part of that mission with the U.S. armed forces, but I'm regretful that after doing all those things, the government is not taking that into consideration.\" </p> <p> Suneeta, an Afghan immigrant living in Albany, N.Y., has been trying since 2014 to reunite with her four children, now ages 7 to 17, who she says are on their own in the Kabul area. This week, those efforts took a more panicked turn. </p> <p> The children told their mother they went to the airport Sunday with their passports and documents from last year granting them humanitarian parole -- which allows temporary admittance into the U.S. for emergency reasons -- but they were turned away because they hadn't secured a necessary visa. Suneeta, who is using only her first name so that her children won't be targeted, heard they made it back to their apartment safely but weren't doing well Monday, said Sara Lowry, an attorney with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants who has been working with her. </p> <p> Suneeta's husband worked with the U.S. military as an interpreter and team leader with the security forces at Camp Eggers. He disappeared in 2013 and is presumed dead. His disappearance makes his children ineligible for a Special Immigrant Visa, which would have required him to be the primary applicant. Suneeta became separated from her children in 2014, when her brother-in-law took them without permission to her husband's family, shortly before she received legal authority to move to the U.S. She was able to see them once in Afghanistan in the past year. </p> <p> \"I pray and hope to have them as soon as possible with me, together,\" Suneeta said Sunday, through an interpreter. \"They've already suffered a lot.\" </p> <p> Mohammad Fawad Salihi said his sisters, both unmarried teachers in their 20s, are among the young women in hiding, terrified they could be forced into marriages with fighters. </p> <p> Days ago, Taliban members paid a visit to Mr. Salihi's father at his house in an area north of Kabul, saying they had heard Mr. Salihi was working for the Americans. No, his father told them; his son previously worked at the airport and then moved to Tajikistan. In reality, Mr. Salihi, 33, settled in Austin, Texas, in 2017, after working with the U.S. State Department in Afghanistan since 2009. </p> <p> After the encounter with the Taliban, Mr. Salihi's family back home split up, fearing for their lives. His mother stayed in their home to protect their belongings, hoping the Taliban wouldn't hurt an older woman. His father and sisters went to hide with family in Kabul, bringing personal items they feared the Taliban would destroy. Along the drive, Taliban members searched their car and smashed their computer and television, Mr. Salihi said. </p> <p> Mr. Salihi, who is a driver for Uber, said he had held off on applying for visas for his family until he was financially stable enough to support them. </p> <p> \"I wish I could have taken them out to a safe place, but it's too late,\" he said Sunday. \"If something happens to them, probably always I'll be saying, 'This is all because of me.'\" </p>",
