  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- After protests and political upheaval prompted China to impose a tough new security law on Hong Kong last year, Key Yeung uprooted her family and left for England. </p><p>   \"Hong Kong is no longer safe,\" Ms. Yeung said. </p><p>   The British government expects hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents to follow in Ms. Yeung's footsteps. In an unusual move that is exacerbating tensions with Beijing, Britain has opened its doors to as many as five million residents of its former colony. </p><p>   As of Sunday, holders of British National Overseas passports -- which are available to Hong Kong citizens born in the territory before it was handed back to China in 1997 -- can move with their families to the U.K. on five-year visas. After that period, they can apply for British citizenship. Previously these passport holders could get only six-month British visas. </p><p>   The immigration overhaul is a response to China's imposition of a new national security law, which Britain says violates Hong Kong's judicial independence from Beijing. The U.K. argues this was guaranteed until 2047. </p><p>   Beijing has accused London of meddling in its affairs and expressed its anger toward the new immigration plan. On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it would no longer recognize the BNO passport as a valid travel document and may take further measures. The move is largely symbolic because people traveling through Hong Kong and mainland China border checkpoints typically use their Hong Kong identity card and a \"return home card\" issued by Chinese authorities. A passport is only used upon entry and exit from other countries. </p><p>   It is unclear how many Hong Kong residents will take up Britain's offer given Covid-19 travel restrictions, Britain's steep economic downturn and pressure from the Chinese government. The U.K. Home Office estimates about 300,000 people will move from Hong Kong to Britain in the next five years. </p><p>   That would dwarf the existing Hong Kong born population in the U.K., which a 2011 census put at just more than 100,000. The visa offer is open to about 70% of Hong Kong's population and could trigger capital outflows of $75 billion from Hong Kong over five years, estimates Bank of America Corp. </p><p>   The immigration plan is the latest round in a tit-for-tat between the U.K. and China. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing pressure from the U.S. and British lawmakers to hold a firm line with China over its treatment of Hong Kong and the Uighur people, a majority Muslim population that has faced a crackdown. </p><p></p>",
