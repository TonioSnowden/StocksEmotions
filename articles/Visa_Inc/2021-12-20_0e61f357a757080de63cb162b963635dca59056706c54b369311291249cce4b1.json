  "title": "The Americans Stuck in Afghanistan",
  "text": "<p>Note that as the U.S. completed its retreat, President Biden estimated there were only 100 to 200 Americans still there \"with some intention to leave.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki explained the discrepancy last week: \"There were people who wanted -- determined they wanted to leave since then.\"</p><p>State added that it \"is currently in touch with fewer than a dozen U.S. citizens who want to leave Afghanistan, are prepared to depart, and have the necessary travel documents.\" This may be technically true given all the qualifiers attached to the number.</p><p>But a source briefed on the situation told us that by the end of November State was tracking 126 Americans still in Afghanistan with five ready to depart. Will most of them want to remain as the country deteriorates further under Taliban rule, including widespread reports of economic shortages and hunger?</p><p>Private organizations and congressional offices have supplemented the Administration's efforts, but sources on Capitol Hill say a lack of transparency from the Administration has made the job more difficult. Accurate information has been hard to get. When information occasionally is released, it tends to focus on positive numbers like total repatriations and relocations instead of those left behind.</p><p>Consider America's abandoned Afghan allies. The Journal has reported that some 29,000 applicants are in the early stages of the Special Immigrant Visa program, which grants Afghans who worked with Americans during the war the right to come to the U.S. Not all of these applicants, whose immediate family could have a right join them, will be approved.</p><p>But some 33,000 applicants and qualifying family members have already made it through vetting. They should be able to leave Afghanistan immediately, but the Journal reported that \"it could take until well into 2022 to complete the evacuation of those who already qualify for flights.\"</p><p>Rep. Michael McCaul credits staff at State and Homeland Security for doing good work. \"But the top brass at the State Department and in the White House seem to be doing everything they can to ignore the deadly catastrophe they created,\" he told us in a statement. \"Congressional Democrats are helping them by refusing to participate in a robust and comprehensive investigation with us.\"</p><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted on Aug. 25: \"There's no deadline on our work to help remaining U.S. citizens &amp; Afghan partners who decide they want to leave to do so.\" But the White House made that task far harder when it set the Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing troops and diplomats from the country without preparing to get all Americans, U.S. residents, and allies out.</p><p>Promising a serious inquiry into the Afghan withdrawal disaster would be a useful GOP campaign promise to make in next year's congressional elections.</p>",
