  "text": "<p>A tech-focused banking challenger catches the attention of established players with its rapid growth, customer friendly image and brightly coloured cards. Sound familiar?</p> <p>We're not talking about Monzo — its founder Tom Blomfield had not yet turned 15 when this company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2000.</p> <p>Egg Banking was the most prominent company in of a wave of “internet banks”, which also included names such as Cahoot and Smile, that took off in the UK at the turn of the century.</p> <p>It listed at a valuation of £1.3bn — close to Monzo's most recent valuation — but the enthusiasm didn't last, and this month marks the 10th anniversary of when the one-time disrupter was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83b6c63e-442c-11e0-931d-00144feab49a\">split in half</a> and sold to two of the oldest names in the industry — Barclays and Yorkshire Building Society.&#xa0;</p> <p>Many in the UK fintech scene like to pretend they invented fintech in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but the current crop of start-ups have plenty of predecessors, and the travails of Egg and its dotcom-era peers provide important lessons for founders today.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“Egg was massively punching above its weight and making the rest of the market sit up and take notice in the UK,” one former employee recalls. “Being part of Egg was like being part of a movement. We really believed we were changing things for the better.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The first lesson from Egg's eventual downfall: international expansion is easier said than done. It is true the company quickly made an impact in the UK — just <a href=\"https://www.prudentialplc.com/~/media/Files/P/Prudential-V3/news-releases/content-pdf/q3.pdf\">three years </a>after launch, it had 5 per cent market share of new credit card balances. It hoped to do the same in France, but underestimated how different the market was, and wasted £150m trying to win over reluctant consumers who weren't used to spending on credit cards.</p> <p>The story will be familiar to executives at many fintechs. Just this week, Revolut abandoned the <a href=\"https://betakit.com/revolut-leaving-canadian-market/\">Canadian market</a> after more than a year of trials. Though Revolut has found success in several other countries, Canada's tough regulations and entrenched oligopoly have made it particularly tough for challengers. N26 gave up on the UK last year, and European firms have been slow to build momentum in the US, where hurdles range from fragmented regulation to differences in consumer habits like the ongoing importance of cheques.</p> <p>Egg also ran into problems closer to home. “You've got to be good at credit decisions,” explained another former staff member. “Egg thought they'd invented alchemy, but soon found it's fine lending money out — getting it back is the difficult bit.”</p> <p>Even neobanks that were once sceptical about lending — such as Monzo and Revolut — have decided credit will be key to their long-term sustainability, but they have yet to prove they can do it well.&#xa0;</p> <p>Monzo started lending in 2019, but in an Autonomous report published last year, analyst Marc Rubinstein wrote that “early credit performance . . . has been poor”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Starling Bank has touted its success, but the bulk of its £2bn in loans were backed by government guarantees, and it will continue to face questions over whether it can assess risk effectively in normal circumstances.</p> <p>Such growing pains are easier to deal with while you have supportive investors. Egg was founded as a division of insurance group Prudential, which maintained a majority stake after its IPO. By the mid-2000s, however, the Pru had its own problems to deal with and was reluctant to keep funding Egg's losses. It was sold first to Citi, then to Barclays and Yorkshire after Citi itself had to be bailed out in the financial crisis.</p> <p>Fintechs learned this lesson when the coronavirus pandemic struck last year; new venture capital funding dried up and existing investors pushed a greater focus on cutting costs and finding a route to profitability.&#xa0;</p> <p>Established high street banks responded to internet banks by ramping up investment in their own online offerings. They have done the same since the launch of the app-based banks, betting that the combination of digital competence <em>and </em>traditional branch and phone networks will give them the edge.</p> <p>How far that argument still stands will be a key factor determining whether modern fintechs can succeed where their predecessors failed.</p> <h1>Quick Fire Q&amp;A</h1> <p><strong>What's your name?</strong> Synthesized</p> <p><strong>When were you founded?</strong>&#xa0;2017</p> <p><strong>Where are you based?</strong>&#xa0;London</p> <p><strong>Who is your founder?</strong>&#xa0;Dr Nicolai Baldin</p> <p><strong>What do you sell, and who do you sell it to? </strong>Synthesized enables banks and insurers&#xa0;to speed up the development of data-driven products in a&#xa0;secure and compliant manner.</p> <p><strong>How did you get started? </strong>Nicolai Baldin identified that innovation is impossible without data. He developed a platform to enable collaboration on data safely.</p> <p><strong>How much money have you raised so far?&#xa0;</strong>$3.5m</p> <p><strong>What's your most recent valuation?&#xa0;</strong>Undisclosed</p> <p><strong>Who are your major shareholders?&#xa0;</strong>IQ CAPITAL, Mundi Ventures, Seedcamp, Pretiosum Ventures, and many leading finance and technology executives in the UK and US</p> <p><strong>There are lots of fintechs out there — what makes you so special? </strong>Synthesized's platform uses sophisticated AI technology to automatically create unlimited, intelligent, bias-free Synthesized data in just 10 minutes.</p> <h1>Fintech fascination</h1> <p><strong>A barrage of bad headlines for Visa:</strong> After Mastercard's heavily-criticised decision to implement a post-Brexit fee hike earlier in the year, this week it was Visa's turn to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4820b619-4d35-4c6a-8523-fc685c047374\">provoke the ire </a>of British business groups. Visa went a step further than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39f553a0-00c5-48ad-a8ee-0b9fd75554b0\">Mastercard</a>, applying higher interchange rates for all transactions between the UK and EU, rather than in just one direction. It will also lift a different type of fee for cross-border transactions next year, and charge more for UK businesses to take payment via corporate credit cards. Separately, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Visa is being investigated by the Department of Justice over potential anti-competitive behaviour in the US debit card market.</p> <p><strong>Trustly preps for $11bn IPO:</strong> One company hoping to take advantage of growing antipathy about Visa and Mastercard is Sweden's Trustly, which<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78caada6-f574-40d1-9166-300afe8488f7\">&#xa0;is preparing</a> for an IPO. The company, which allows consumers to bypass<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd8e60bc-e466-4f44-9ca1-2384afdfcc71\"> card networks</a> by paying for products direct from their bank account, this week reported a 40 per cent increase in annual revenues and 30 per cent rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.</p> <p><strong>Digging deeper on Stripe:</strong> Trustly will be hoping to take advantage of some of the same investor appetite that helped Stripe to a record-breaking $95bn valuation. We mentioned Stripe's fundraising news last week, but if you're similarly hungry for more, check out the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bfda026-df9d-42e4-8679-c26a072e0522\"> FT's analysis</a> of how Stripe made it this far, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/338540c1-a371-460d-ad73-8c02baa38c01\">this profile</a> of the two brothers who brought it there.</p> <p><strong>Allica and Landbay ink £1bn partnership:</strong> Allica Bank, the digital business bank led by former Revolut executive Richard Davies, last week agreed a <a href=\"https://www.financialreporter.co.uk/mortgages/landbay-secures-1billion-of-funding-from-allica-bank.html\">deal </a>with property lender Landbay to fund up to £1bn of new buy-to-let mortgages. The agreement highlights how former peer-to-peer lenders like Landbay have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b26ecf08-fd2f-4c7f-93ce-f6d55888da83\">changed their approach</a> in recent years — Landbay <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/facb5e14-175a-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\">closed its doors </a>to retail investors in 2019, and now focuses on originating loans for other institutions. For Allica meanwhile, it underscores the bank's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/461018c8-9217-47ab-ba0a-21a64ea3034a\">drive</a> to expand its balance sheet as it enters its second full year as a licensed bank.</p><p>Source: Nicholas Megaw 2021 'Lessons from the UK's first fintech failures' FT.com 22 March.
