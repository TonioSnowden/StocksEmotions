  "text": "<p>The big sponsors of the Beijing Winter Olympics, including&#xa0;Visa, Coca-Cola, Airbnb and Omega, are under pressure from human rights campaigners&#xa0;to use their leverage to address human rights abuses in China.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch, a US-headquartered campaign group, said letters sent to each of the top corporate sponsors in May questioning their involvement in the Beijing Games drew no responses from the companies.</p> <p>“There are just three months until the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, but corporate sponsors remain silent over how they are using their influence to address China's appalling human rights record,” said Sophie Richardson, director of the China programme at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>“[The sponsors] are squandering the opportunity to show their commitment to human rights standards and risk instead being associated with an Olympics tainted by censorship and repression,” she said.</p> <p>The group's targeting of some of the world's highest profile consumer brands marks the latest sign of the international furore surrounding the Games. </p> <p>The campaigns pose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad67dd70-1863-4440-81d4-36ddb798af60\">awkward ethical questions</a> to governments, companies and athletes over their engagement with China. </p> <p>Human rights groups and some western politicians are using China's role as host of the international sporting event to highlight <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdfbd758-a91b-47b3-accf-37f202429936\">human rights abuses</a> and repression, including Beijing's security crackdowns in Xinjiang and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b1b5d90-cb45-4de9-b8e7-ddd273b87ff7\">Hong Kong</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd1d63dd-2260-4220-b6e9-9e12bd0cbe46\">There is debate</a> over whether a widespread boycott of the Games would be effective in pressuring China to change course in its treatment of the Uyghurs and other minority groups.</p> <p>Still, some western parliamentarians — including from the UK, the US and the EU — have for months called for politicians and dignitaries to boycott the 2022 Games. </p> <p>The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an&#xa0;international cross-party group of legislators, has suggested the Games be relocated. Others have called for a complete athlete boycott. </p> <p>In April, Ned Price, the US state department spokesperson, said a boycott was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92d57e46-4c63-46f2-be08-de8a9954256e\">one option “on the agenda”</a>. President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, are expected to hold a virtual summit next week. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch on Friday published its letters sent to the companies. The group urged corporate sponsors to press Beijing to allow an international investigation into Xinjiang and to demand the release of detained human rights defenders.</p> <p>In September activists from 200 different human rights groups wrote to international broadcast networks, urging them to cancel deals to show the Games. According to a letter sent to the networks, the groups said broadcasters were at “serious risk of being complicit in China's plan to ‘sport wash' the severe and worsening human rights abuses”.</p> <p>China has already ruled that no foreign spectators would be able to enter the country to attend the Games, part of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17314336-b7df-453a-b2ca-25a58e26ca3e\">strict border controls</a> and regional lockdown as it fights to eradicate Covid-19. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Human Rights Watch also noted that visiting athletes and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcc7984f-26f4-4548-951a-a3ed8889e46b\">Chinese spectators</a> might risk “censorship or reprisals” if they protested at the Games in a way that was critical of the government and the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>The international boycott campaign coincides with rising public activism by a new generation of high profile athletes.</p> <p>The trend has gathered pace and spread internationally in the four years since <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72dafdeb-a5d1-4550-8328-30045959b849\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, an NFL quarterback, knelt during the US national anthem played before each match he played, in protest against police violence. </p> <p>More recently, Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b004c93-2e8d-48d5-bbea-e3cff1d79ea8\">garnered widespread acclaim</a> for advocating for awareness of racial injustice and mental health.</p><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul 2021 'Beijing Winter Olympics sponsors pressured over China's ‘appalling human rights record'' FT.com 12 November.
