  "title": "U.S. News:  Pentagon to House Afghan Interpreters at Bases in Virginia, Qatar  ----  By Gordon Lubold and Michael R. Gordon",
  "text": "<p>   The Pentagon will use military bases in the U.S. and Qatar to house thousands of Afghan interpreters and translators, along with their families, part of a scramble to evacuate those who worked with the U.S. during the war and face retribution from the Taliban, according to officials. </p><p>   Initially, about 2,500 Afghans -- 700 interpreters and family members -- will be flown from Afghanistan to Fort Lee, Va., for short-term housing while awaiting final processing for Special Immigrant Visas allowing them to stay in the U.S., according to Ned Price, a State Department spokesman. </p><p>   \"These are brave Afghans and their families, as we have said, who have served the United States and who have completed thorough SIV security vetting processes,\" he said. </p><p>   In addition to the Afghans headed to Virginia, Qatari officials have agreed to allow thousands of Afghans who worked for the U.S. and their families to live temporarily at the al Udeid air base in Qatar, a U.S. official said. The air base can accommodate 2,000 Afghans, although additional infrastructure potentially could be built to house thousands more, the official said. Qatari officials didn't respond to a request for comment. Qatar has invested billions in the base, which is used by the U.S. military to support operations across the Middle East. </p><p>   The plans come as the military pursues a U.S. withdrawal by the end of August as ordered by President Biden, triggering concern for the fate of thousands of Afghans who aided the U.S. Estimates of the number of interpreters and others who assisted the U.S. range as high as 40,000 to 50,000 people. Advocates of the Afghans who helped the U.S. have estimated that at least 300 have been killed since 2009 while seeking a U.S. visa, a process that can take years. </p><p>   Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress in June that the State Department has a backlog of about 18,000 pending applications. </p><p>   For months, the administration has been urged by both Democrats and Republicans, as well as top military leaders, to rescue those interpreters. As political pressure has grown, Mr. Biden pushed for administration officials to move faster, according to a U.S. official familiar with the discussions. </p><p>   Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, addressing the plans for Fort Lee, said Monday that the Defense Department would provide food and housing, as well as medical care and religious facilities for the applicants and their families. The visa applicants and their relatives weren't likely to stay at the military base, about 25 miles south of Richmond, for more than about three days before they are settled elsewhere permanently in the U.S., he said. </p><p>   Applicants and their families will reside in existing housing facilities on the base, Mr. Kirby said. Other military sites are under consideration for additional interpreters and their families if the State Department requires more locations, he said. </p><p>   President Biden said last week that the first group of evacuees would be flown out of Afghanistan by the end of the month, but administration officials have withheld details of the program as they worked to find locations to take the interpreters and to closely guard plans for security reasons. </p><p>   The Special Immigrant Visa program is aimed at providing U.S. visas for individuals who performed \"sensitive and trusted activities\" for U.S. military, diplomatic and other personnel. The U.S. is supposed to take action on the visas within nine months, but some take three to five years to adjudicate. </p><p></p>",
