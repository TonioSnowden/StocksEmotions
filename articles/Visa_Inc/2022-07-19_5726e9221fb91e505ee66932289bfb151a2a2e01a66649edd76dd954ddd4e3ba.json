  "text": "<p>Santander, Virgin Money, Visa and Beazley have become the latest financial services companies to offer pay rises or one-off bonuses to staff to help deal with the soaring cost of living.</p> <p>This week, 11,000 UK-based staff at Spanish bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d47803e0-9965-4d9a-af69-c346aa27ade8\">Santander </a>were told they would receive a 4 per cent pay rise to help with fast-rising inflation, which is squeezing incomes across the UK particularly for lower-earning families. </p> <p>Santander will offer the pay rise to staff earning less than £35,000 — covering about 60 per cent of the workforce — and increase its entry level salaries to £19,500.</p> <p>Santander chief executive Mike Regnier said the pay raise would “make a real difference to the majority of our customer-facing and contact centre staff”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/2637f6d1-ed91-4999-ba4c-03e2d227e3e9\">Visa</a> has offered a 5 per cent pay increase to staff in the UK from July, according to one person familiar with the situation.</p> <p>Virgin Money also said on Tuesday that it would give £1,000 to almost 80 per cent of its workforce earning less than £50,000 as a one-off “cost of living” payment in August wages.</p> <p>Staff had already received an average increase of 5 per cent in base salary in January. The extra pay bump will not be factored into future pay reviews, it said.</p> <p>Unite, the workers' union, said it had helped secure the pay rise and would continue to campaign to make sure wages increased in line with inflation.</p> <p>The financial services sector has been at the forefront of offering one-off pay increases or non-recurring bonuses to help lower-paid staff in particular. Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group have promised pay rises in recent months to help many of their staff cope with costs. </p> <p>UK staff at NatWest earning less than £32,000 — about 17,300 employees — will be given an unscheduled pay rise of 4 per cent from September.</p> <p>Lloyd's of London insurer Beazley also last month made a one-off gross payment of £3,000 for those earning up to £50,000, intended as help with the rising cost of living, according to a person familiar with the details.</p> <p>Economists expect a further rise in the headline inflation rate from 9.1 per cent in May to a fresh 40-year high in June, driven by sharp rises in petrol and diesel prices last month. Some expect inflation to peak at almost 12 per cent in October. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics said earnings grew by 4.3 per cent in the three months to May excluding bonuses but failed to match the rate of inflation.</p> <p>The pay squeeze has caused a surge in worker disputes. More than 40,000 British workers at BT Group will hold a two-day national strike at the end of this month.</p> <p>Other companies are also seeking to help workers deal with inflationary pressure. Housebuilder Barratt Developments awarded all staff below senior management level £1,000 this month, which will be paid between now and December. </p> <p>Barratt chief executive David Thomas said the “rising cost of living is impacting on colleagues across the business but we are committed to supporting our teams”.</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas, Ian Smith and George Hammond 2022 'Banks and insurers boost UK staff pay to combat cost of living' FT.com 19 July.
