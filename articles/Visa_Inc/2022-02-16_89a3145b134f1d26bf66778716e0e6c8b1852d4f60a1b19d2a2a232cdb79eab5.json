  "text": "<p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B is, of course, primarily a conglomerate of insurance companies, but also railroads, utilities and companies involved in power generation. Through its stock portfolio, Berkshire also has large investments in other industries, as you can see below.</p><p>The company's quarterly 13F listing its stock holdings as of Dec. 31 was filed with the SEC on Feb. 14. One change of note from the previous quarter was that Berkshire Hathaway had bought shares of Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI before the video game developer agreed to be acquired by Microsoft Corp. MSFT on Jan. 18. This is an all-cash deal valued at $68.7 billion, which will need to clear regulatory hurdles before completion.</p><p>Berkshire's Activision shares were worth $975 million as of Dec. 31, which the Associated Press described as a “big stake.” However, that was actually Berkshire's 24th largest stock holding as of the end of 2021. That's hardly enough to move the needle for Berkshire.</p><p>Buffett has been a long-term holder of Apple Inc. AAPL, and Berkshire's Apple shares were worth $157.5 billion as of the end of 2021. But Berkshire's ownership stake in Apple was 5.41%. Within Berkshire's stock portfolio, the conglomerate had larger ownership percentages in 15 companies.</p><p>Two lists of Berkshire's largest stock holdings</p><p>First, here are the 20 companies for which Berkshire held at least 3% of common shares as of Dec 31:</p><p> Company                                        Ticker  Value of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings – Dec. 31, 2021 ($mil)  Company market cap – Dec. 31, 2021 ($mil)  Berkshire ownership stake  DaVita Inc.
