  "text": "<p>A strong earnings season had propelled stocks to fresh highs in recent weeks, with investors shaking off concerns that supply-chain issues might weigh on profits or that higher prices might keep people from spending. Lowe's shares added 2% Wednesday after the company boosted its full-year sales guidance. TJX gained 10% after the retailer posted earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations.</p><p>But the market momentum has cooled over the past week. Target shares fell 4.6% Wednesday even though the retailer posted revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations.</p><p>The coming year likely won't get the same benefits that 2021 did, such as stimulus checks and bounceback from the Covid-19 pandemic's lows, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>\"Don't get too comfortable in the fast lane,\" Ms. Roland said this week. \"Next year, we just don't see the highest-risk parts of the market leading, and we're actually looking to trim risk into spring.\"</p><p>Still, stocks are trading near record highs. Low returns on government bonds have helped drive investors to buy stocks.</p><p>\"Equities are incrementally earning significantly more than bonds,\" said Edward Park, chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Brooks Macdonald. \"There is still a fear of missing out in markets at the moment driven by that relative valuation.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 1.629% Wednesday, down from 1.632% Tuesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Visa Inc. shares fell 5.2% after Amazon.com Inc. said it would stop accepting Visa's U.K. credit cards because of their high fees. The move marks a major escalation in the e-commerce giant's yearslong battle with the card network.</p><p>Shares of Tesla rose 4.6%. Chief Executive Elon Musk sold another 934,000 shares Tuesday for roughly $973 million, continuing a recent selling spree, according to regulatory filings.</p><p>Fresh data showed that housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, declined 0.7% in October from September. Home builders are contending with rising material costs and labor shortages, which are driving up home prices.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 stock index rose 0.2%. In Asia, major stock indexes closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 shed 0.4%. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Slip After Target, Lowe's Earnings</p>",
