  "text": "<p>For much of this year, the prospect of looser immigration rules has been dangled in front of them. The government's budget in March promised a new fast-track visa scheme for skilled migrants who have a job offer from a high-growth British firm. “High-growth”, it later turned out, meant firms that have increased their revenue or staff numbers by 20% a year for three successive years, having started with at least ten employees (so a firm that went from ten to 18 employees in three years would qualify). Such companies would no longer have to sponsor visa applications, meaning they would be spared bureaucracy and fees, and their recently arrived employees would be able to switch jobs more easily.</p><p>This is not the only scheme intended to attract talented foreigners to Britain. The government's innovation strategy, published in July, included plans to make all graduates of top global universities eligible for visas, whether or not they hold a job offer. It also intends to make it easier for entrepreneurs elsewhere to move to Britain in order to found their businesses, rather than doing so at home. Political and industry insiders expect the full details of the new schemes to be laid out in the next budget, on October 27th, and for them to be strikingly generous.</p><p>“Top global university” may end up meaning any institution that appears in the top 50, or even 100, of one of the main rankings for the subject in question. Eligible entrepreneurs are likely to include any with backing from a reasonably credible venture-capital fund. Such measures will, at least initially, increase the competition faced by well-educated Britons for the most coveted jobs. In the longer term, the government hopes that an influx of skilled risk-takers will fuel innovation, investment and, ultimately, job creation.</p><p>All of this represents a significant liberalisation, says John Kiely of Fragomen, a law firm specialising in immigration. Although the existing Global Talent Visa allows companies to hire exceptional migrants without sponsoring their visa applications, “it is a programme designed only for the best—not for the good or the very good”. Outside this programme, Fragomen calculates that a single skilled worker entering Britain to work for a large company for three years would incur a total visa cost of £5,681 ($7,706). That compares poorly with Britain's neighbours: the equivalent fees in France and Germany are €324 ($374) and €175 respectively.</p><p>Entrepreneurs seeking to hire will still have some reasons to grumble. The government has remained tight-lipped about how much cheaper the new schemes will be. For cash-strapped startups, that is a substantial caveat. Moreover, many European candidates are hesitant to move to a country that, after Brexit, they perceive as a hostile environment.</p><p>“When government ministers bash immigrants in the papers to throw red meat to their base, they should remember the people they're trying to attract can read English,” advises one industry insider. Such rhetoric is also increasingly unnecessary. Since the Brexit vote, immigration has become a lot less politically toxic. “Now we've taken back control,” says the insider, “we can let the coders in.”</p><p>■</p>",
