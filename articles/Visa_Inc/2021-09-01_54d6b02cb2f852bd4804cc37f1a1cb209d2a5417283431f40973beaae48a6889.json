  "text": "<p>   Will the U.S. add dishonor to defeat in Afghanistan? Our treatment of the Afghans who worked with us over the past two decades will determine the answer. </p><p>   From a standing start two weeks ago, the American military managed to evacuate all but a few hundred of the U.S. citizens who wanted to leave, according to White House estimates, along with more than 100,000 Afghans. This was a notable feat, accomplished against the odds. </p><p>   Although our military involvement in Afghanistan has ended, the evacuation hasn't. Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, acknowledged that \"we did not get out everybody that we wanted to get out.\" More than 263,000 Afghans have worked with American forces since 2001, and many others for American contractors and nonprofits. Some qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa program; most don't. But despite Taliban promises, all of them face reprisal, which many will experience once the jihadist group has achieved its core diplomatic objectives. </p><p>   The U.S. has a moral obligation to the Afghans we left behind. Washington should use all the leverage it has left to ensure that Afghans whose association with America puts them in danger can leave their country and, if they pass stringent vetting, settle within our borders. After we withdrew from Saigon in 1975, the U.S. allowed hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and others from the region to immigrate. They have strengthened and served our country and are among its most loyal citizens. </p><p>   Early surveys indicate strong grass-roots support across party lines for such a policy, but whether it continues will depend on the behavior of political leaders in the coming months. I am unaware of significant dissent among Democrats. Not so for Republicans, who face a split between the Reagan-Bush approach to foreign policy and that of Donald Trump. </p><p>   Speaking for the former, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said: \"We need to care for them. We owe it to these people, who are our friends and who worked with us, to get them out safely if we can.\" Other Republican senators, including Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney, backed his position, as did Rep. John Katko, ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee. The Republican governors of Utah and Arkansas, among others, declared their willingness to resettle Afghan refugees in their states. </p><p>   Regrettably, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy chose to muddy the waters, citing unspecified threats that ISIS, al Qaeda and the Taliban will seize the opportunity to introduce terrorists into the U.S. and linking alleged threats from Afghanistan to the situation on our southern border. Pro-Trump House Republican Matt Rosendale of Montana opined that \"the chaos we're seeing is not an excuse to flood our country with refugees from Afghanistan,\" while Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene warned darkly of \"chain migration\" and rejected allowing refugees to resettle in her state, as its governor had offered. </p><p>   It gets worse. Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump's top immigration adviser, told Fox News that \"Resettling [Afghans] in America is not about solving a humanitarian crisis; it is about accomplishing an ideological objective -- to change America.\" Not to be outdone, Fox's Tucker Carlson predicted that the number of Afghan refugees could swell into the millions. \"So first we invade, and then we are invaded,\" he said. </p><p>   The Biden administration must accept its share of responsibility for the moral emergency the U.S. now faces. As far back as the presidential transition, advocacy groups warned the Biden team that the SIV program was being stymied by red tape and needed to be accelerated dramatically. As conditions worsened in the spring, calls mounted for mass evacuations of Afghans who had worked with America. As late as June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed confidence that U.S. diplomats would remain on the job in Kabul to process SIV applications after the military withdrawal and that there would be ample time to respond to signs of deterioration in the security situation. </p><p>   Now President Biden must do what he can to mitigate the consequences of these misjudgments. Issuing a finding that continuing the evacuation is in the national interest, as Bing West and Paul Wolfowitz recently suggested in these pages, would be a good first step. Monday's United Nations Security Council resolution, adopted with abstentions from Russia and China, laid down three requirements for the Taliban: human rights for women and minorities, safe passage out of the country for Afghans with travel documents from other countries, and a guarantee that the Taliban will not allow Afghanistan to revert to a haven for terrorists. Now the Biden administration should structure the financial measures the Taliban want -- access to Afghan funds on deposit in foreign banks, sanctions relief, and the resumption of international assistance -- to encourage compliance with the U.N. resolution. The Taliban must be left with no doubt that reprisals against Afghans who worked with us will trigger painful diplomatic and financial penalties. </p><p>   In a forceful speech on Tuesday, President Biden insisted that our remaining leverage over the Taliban will induce their compliance with the world's demands. In the coming months, we will find out whether he is right. </p><p>   Only by making it clear to Americans and the world that we have done everything in our power fulfill our obligations to Afghans as well as American citizens can Mr. Biden hope to preserve what national honor we have left. </p><p></p>",
