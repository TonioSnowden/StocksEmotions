  "title": "World News:  Afghans Despair Over Long Visa Process  ---  Even as U.S. races to  airlift allies, thousands  of special-immigration  applicants are stuck  ----  By Jessica Donati",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Rahmat said he was relieved when the Central Intelligence Agency phoned him for an interview and, weeks later, arranged to shelter him on an Afghan base while the State Department processed his application for a visa to flee Afghanistan. </p><p>   He feared the Taliban were hunting him down for his work spying for the CIA in remote border areas of Afghanistan for almost a decade, and lacked the paperwork to apply for a visa. But Rahmat isn't in the clear. </p><p>   The Taliban are advancing on Kabul, and even if he can make it to the capital from his hideout in a province hours away, the Afghan commander of the base has since told him he can't shelter there. </p><p>   \"I'm very worried,\" he said in a text message. \"We are feeling in danger here. Please save our family.\" </p><p>   Rahmat's story reflects the fears of thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war and now face a desperate race to leave the country. The Wall Street Journal agreed to use only his first name. </p><p>   About 18,000 Afghans who have applied for the U.S.'s Special Immigrant Visa, as well as their families, remain on the ground in Afghanistan, with about half of those outside Kabul, in areas either already under Taliban control or likely to fall soon, a congressional aide said. </p><p>   In addition, the State Department this month said tens of thousands more Afghans would be eligible for priority treatment under a U.S. refugee settlement program. The new criteria applied to Afghans who worked for U.S. government contractors, U.S.-funded programs and U.S.-based media or nongovernmental organizations, as well as their families. </p><p>   The precise criteria remain uncertain, and the State Department hasn't said whether part-time and contract workers for U.S. organizations would be eligible. The prospective refugees would have to get themselves out of Afghanistan to a third country at their own expense, the State Department said. </p><p>   Former soldiers, aid workers and others who previously worked in Afghanistan have been inundated with requests from former Afghan colleagues and employees seeking letters of recommendation and help in fleeing the country. </p><p>   Rahmat's fortune turned, at least temporarily, when, following the publication of a Wall Street Journal article on his plight last month, the CIA got in touch and arranged to help with his visa application. </p><p>   The Taliban on Friday seized Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city and the Islamist movement's birthplace. With full control of southern and western Afghanistan, the insurgent movement is marshaling its forces for a final march on Kabul. </p><p>   The U.S. has already launched the drawdown of its large embassy in Kabul, sending troops to evacuate most of the staff and cutting the diplomatic presence to an essential core. Other Western embassies are readying similar plans, fearing that the Taliban could lay siege to the Afghan capital within days. </p><p>   Commercial flights from Kabul are booked solid, with expatriates and Afghans holding visas for foreign countries attempting to leave. Tens of thousands of people escaping the Taliban's advances in the provinces, meanwhile, have flocked into the Afghan capital, sleeping in city parks and mosques. </p><p>   Among the tasks for the remaining U.S. diplomats is the processing of Special Immigrant Visa applications for Afghans like Rahmat. The troops arriving beginning this week will help airlift Afghan applicants who have reached the latter stages of the 14-step Special Immigrant Visa process. </p><p>   The Biden administration has responded to pressure to do more to help Afghan allies after months of advocacy from members of Congress and veterans groups. </p><p>   Earlier this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the U.S. would accelerate the pace of flights. The government has flown more than 1,200 Afghans to the U.S. in recent weeks, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday. </p><p>   \"Additional flights will begin landing daily, and you're going to see the total number grow very quickly in the coming days and the coming weeks,\" Mr. Price said. </p><p>   Clemence Quint, the co-founder of Magenta, a consulting firm that has worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan, said she is helping about 500 staff members apply for priority treatment to join the refugee program. </p><p>   She said the lack of clarity over the process, and the requirement for Afghans to leave the country to apply for refugee status, make it very difficult for those seeking refuge, and encourage illegal and dangerous cross-border migration. </p><p>   \"Efforts to get endorsement from U.S. officials have been slow, and they themselves are not entirely sure of the process,\" she said. \"Having to get to a third country is obviously a major barrier and contradicts messaging around irregular migration.\" </p><p></p>",
