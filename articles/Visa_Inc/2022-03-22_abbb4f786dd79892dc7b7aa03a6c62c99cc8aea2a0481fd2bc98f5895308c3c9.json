  "title": "Technology:  Firms Wade Into  NFTs Despite Lack  Of Accounting Rules  ----  By Mark Maurer",
  "text": "<p>   More U.S. companies are investing in nonfungible tokens even though there are no specific accounting rules or disclosure requirements for them. </p><p>   These tokens, or NFTs, are digital proofs of purchase for items such as art, baseball cards or digital music and can provide access to services like live streamed concerts. </p><p>   NFT sales last year totaled $25.51 billion, up from $95.11 million in 2020, according to DappRadar, a blockchain analytics firm. This year, sales through March 10 have already surpassed last year's total, at more than $27 billion. </p><p>   NFTs are yet another digital asset -- alongside bitcoin and Ethereum -- for which U.S. reporting rules don't specify how to account for or disclose. </p><p>   NFTs are more difficult to value than cryptocurrencies because they aren't interchangeable, can't be traded on exchanges and tend to be treated similarly to art or music, with their worth being somewhat subjective, said Vivian Fang, associate accounting professor at the University of Minnesota. The price of NFTs isn't based on trades on a particular exchange, but instead, on the level of supply or demand for the related market. </p><p>   Businesses such as lifestyle firm PLBY Group Inc., toy maker Hasbro Inc., online sports-betting company DraftKings Inc. and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. in recent months have incorporated NFTs into their business by, for example, creating NFTs for customer loyalty programs or building platforms to trade them. Payments services firm Visa Inc. last August said it paid for an NFT using nearly $150,000 in Ethereum to better understand the marketplace for these tokens. \"We need a firsthand understanding of the infrastructure requirements for a global brand to purchase, store, and leverage an NFT,\" Cuy Sheffield, Visa's head of crypto, said in a blog post at the time. The San Francisco-based company declined to comment further. </p><p>   Companies that purchase and hold NFTs account for them as indefinite-lived intangible assets -- similar to bitcoin, trademarks and website domains -- based on nonbinding guidelines from the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants. Under those guidelines, businesses have to review the value of the assets at least once a year. Companies need to write down the value if it drops below the purchase price, depending on the result of their annual impairment test. If the value rises, they can only record a gain when they sell the assets. </p><p>   PLBY, the Los Angeles-based company behind the Playboy brand, last year bought about $250,000 in NFTs. Accounting for NFTs as intangibles doesn't accurately reflect the volatility of these tokens, Chief Financial Officer Lance Barton said. \"The fact that you can't mark it back up doesn't really seem to make sense,\" he said. </p><p>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board doesn't have plans to review accounting or disclosure for NFTs, a spokeswoman said. The U.S. accounting standard setter in December said it would conduct research on how to account for and disclose digital assets that don't carry ownership rights, such as cryptocurrencies. The FASB's research on digital assets won't cover NFTs, as these digital assets generally have copyrights, the spokeswoman said. </p><p>   The Securities and Exchange Commission under Chairman Gary Gensler is working to clarify the rules for the approximately $2 trillion cryptocurrency market, though its focus is more on crypto lending and trading platforms than NFTs. </p><p></p>",
