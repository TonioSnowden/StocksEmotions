  "title": "What's in $1.65 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill, and What Isn't; The legislation includes increases in military and nondefense spending and changes to the Electoral Count Act",
  "text": "<p>Billions in new funding</p><p>The bill funds government agencies and increased defense funding by $76 billion, totaling $858 billion. Domestic spending totals $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion from the prior year, and a shift in the traditional parity that lawmakers often insist upon. The bill also includes $45 billion for Ukraine and allies, an increase from President Biden's $37 billion request, and perhaps a sign that lawmakers think this could be the last time they are able to get money approved before House Republicans take control of Congress next year. Lawmakers also included $40 billion to help communities hit by hurricanes, storms and wildfires. The spending package kept annual funding for the Internal Revenue Service essentially flat.</p><p>Changes to how Electoral College votes are counted</p><p>Lawmakers included a bill known as the Electoral Count Reform Act, which would overhaul an 1887 law governing how Congress counts and ratifies presidential elector votes in response to efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to try to overturn the 2020 election results by pressuring former Vice President Mike Pence to object to certifying the election on Jan. 6, 2021. The bill would make clear that Congress's role in ratifying states' Electoral College votes is ministerial and that the vice president's role is merely to count the votes publicly. It also would dramatically raise the threshold to sustain an objection to a state's electors from one House member and one senator to one-fifth of both chambers.</p><p>Changes to the retirement system</p><p>A bipartisan bill that would expand incentives for retirement savings made it into the package. Lawmakers have been working for months to reconcile House and Senate versions. The legislation would raise the starting age for required minimum distributions from tax-deferred accounts, encourage enrollment in retirement plans and expand savings incentives for low-income households. It also includes new limits on aggressive tax deals known as syndicated conservation easements.</p><p>Help for Afghan immigrants</p><p>The bill includes an extension of the Special Immigrant Visa program which offers green cards to Afghans who worked for the U.S. military through 2024 and creates an additional 4,000 visas for them. The visas offer one of the few ways for Afghans who weren't evacuated after the Taliban seized back power in 2021 to make it to the U.S., and without an extension of the program, unused visas would have gone to waste in a year. The bill doesn't include a separate proposed measure that helps Afghans evacuated to the U.S. achieve permanent legal status, as veterans and a bipartisan group of lawmakers had pushed for.</p><p>Permanent funding for meals for children during summer</p><p>The bill creates a permanent program to help low-income families to buy extra groceries to supplement traditional summer meals programs, aimed at helping 29 million children. The bill also establishes flexibility for alternative meal delivery for rural areas such as grab and go, mobile delivery, backpack programs or shipping meals.</p><p>Ban on TikTok on government devices</p><p>The popular video app TikTok will be banned on all government-issued smartphones and other devices. It previously was prohibited for many defense and intelligence workers. The ban comes amid widening concerns over the Chinese-owned app's security risks for the U.S.</p><p>An extension to Boeing's 737 MAX deadline</p><p>Lawmakers included a measure that would extend a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. The company would be required by law to install new cockpit-alerting systems to help pilots resolve emergencies in the wake of two deadly crashes.</p><p>The deadline was set by Congress two years ago, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected. Without an extension, Boeing said in a securities filing that it might cancel both planes, exposing it to financial losses. The company didn't specify how much it could lose in the filing, but orders for the planes are valued at tens of billions of dollars in revenue.</p><p>Break for lobster industry</p><p>Maine's lobster industry will get a break in the bill through a provision delaying until 2029 the implementation of new, stricter regulations aimed at protecting the tiny population of North Atlantic right whales. In July, a federal judge sided with environmental groups who sued the government, saying it needed to do more to protect the roughly 340 remaining right whales from becoming entangled in ropes connected to lobster traps.</p><p>Maine's lobster industry has disputed that its ropes pose a threat to the whales and noted that it already implemented new steps in May to minimize any risk, including adding weak inserts into ropes so they will break more easily if a whale becomes entangled.</p><p>Tightening rules on conservation easements</p><p>A measure targeting so-called syndicated conservation easements was included in the bill. It takes aim at the proliferation of deals whereby investors can make money from tax breaks for conservation. The legislation would deny deductions in cases in which the claimed break exceeds 2.5 times the investment.</p><p>What didn't make it in the omnibus bill?</p><p>Marijuana banking: A bipartisan provision to shield banks from penalties if they handle marijuana-related transactions. Banks that do business with the cannabis industry currently risk losing their federal banking charters because marijuana, despite being legal in some states, remains illegal on a federal level. As a result, some marijuana businesses are excluded from credit-card processing and rely heavily on cash to operate, making them targets for robberies. Lawmakers have been trying to pass legislation focused on this for years.</p><p>Habitat protection: Some lawmakers were also trying to include a measure that would steer federal money toward projects to restore habitats for struggling species. The measure would fund state conservation plans, which are federally required strategies and wish lists that wildlife agency officials keep on struggling animal, fish and plant populations they monitor.</p><p>Business/family tax changes: Some lawmakers had hoped to reverse business-tax increases that were scheduled in the 2017 tax law and took effect starting this year. But Democrats wanted to link those to the child tax credit, arguing for assistance for very low-income families. No deal came together and the business tax changes will take effect as scheduled unless Congress acts. Lawmakers also didn't change or delay a new requirement that will have payment platforms such as Venmo sending more informational tax documents to the IRS and taxpayers about sales of goods and services. Those forms will likely go out early next year unless the administration delays the change.</p><p>Cocaine sentencing: Also not in the bill, despite broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House, was a law meant to eliminate the disparity in federal sentencing between drug offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Legislation passed during the height of the 1980s drug wars set the same penalty for the possession of five grams of crack cocaine as possessing 500 grams of often more expensive powder cocaine. Lawmakers have since narrowed the gap in how crack-cocaine and powder-cocaine offenses are treated.</p><p>â€”Siobhan Hughes, Michelle Hackman, Katy Stech Ferek, Richard Rubin and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>What's in $1.65 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill, and What Isn't</p>",
