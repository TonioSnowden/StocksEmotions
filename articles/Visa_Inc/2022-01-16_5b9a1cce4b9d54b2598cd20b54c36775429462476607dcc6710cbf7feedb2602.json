  "title": "Novak Djokovic Deported on Eve of Australian Open After Court Upholds Visa Cancellation; Tennis star departed Melbourne for Dubai late Sunday night and might be blocked from returning for three years",
  "text": "<p>The men's world No.1 had arrived in Melbourne as the heavy favorite for a record 10th win at the Australian Open, which starts on Monday and included Djokovic as its top men's seed. Djokovic, who spoke against vaccine mandates as recently as November, said he believed he had an exemption from rules requiring travelers to the country to have received two shots of a Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>Djokovic had been scheduled to face fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanović on Monday in the opening round of the tournament. He instead left Sunday night on an Emirates flight to Dubai and might be blocked from returning for three years, by which time he would be 37 and likely past his prime as a player.</p><p>Djokovic said he was extremely disappointed. \"I will now be taking some time to rest and to recuperate, before making any further comments beyond this,\" he said.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he welcomed the decision to keep the country's borders strong and keep Australians safe.</p><p>\"Irrespective of how this point has been reached, Novak is one of our sport's greatest champions and his absence from the Australian Open is a loss for the game,\" said the Association of Tennis Professionals, which organizes the men's tennis tour.</p><p>Djokovic arrived in Australia as the country faced a surge in cases of Covid-19, which authorities had successfully contained until recently, largely by closing the border. Mr. Hawke said that letting the tennis star stay could stoke antivaccine sentiment.</p><p>Authorities have been encouraging as many of the country's 26 million people as possible to get vaccinated as Australia shifts from suppressing the virus to living with it. Djokovic's 11 days in the country made him a lightning rod in the debate over Covid-19 vaccine mandates.</p><p>\"His presence in Australia, given his well-known stance on vaccination, creates a risk of strengthening the anti-vaccination sentiment of a minority of the Australian community,\" Mr. Hawke said in a notice to cancel Djokovic's visa a second time.</p><p>The country has one of the highest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the world. Australia, where children aged 5 to 11 years old only began to receive their first shots last week, has vaccinated roughly 79% of its total population, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has, by comparison, vaccinated 64%.</p><p>The number of people hesitant about taking Covid-19 vaccines has fallen sharply over the past year, according to the Melbourne Institute, an economic and social-policy research center at the University of Melbourne, but those still resistant might be entrenched in their view. The center, which tracks community hesitancy to Covid-19 vaccines, says Australia might struggle to convince 10% of its population to receive shots for the coronavirus and that one in four might be hesitant to receive boosters.</p><p>Antivaccine protests have occurred in major cities in recent months, sometimes attracting thousands of people to protest mandatory vaccination in certain industries or for children. On Saturday, protesters again marched through Melbourne and Sydney–Australia's two largest cities–some of them waving Serbian flags and others clutching messages of support for Djokovic.</p><p>Djokovic's attorney Nick Wood had argued that Hawke's reasoning for wanting to deport the vaccine skeptic tennis star was flawed because his deportation could also inflame antivaccine sentiment. Hawke's attorney, Stephen Lloyd, told the court that the minister had noted the protests.</p><p>Conflict over vaccine mandates has reverberated through Canberra, the country's capital. Five coalition senators in November crossed the floor to back a minor party's bill against vaccine mandates, which was unsuccessful.</p><p>Australian lawmaker Craig Kelly last year quit the center-right Liberal Party that governs as part of a coalition after being criticized by Morrison, the prime minister, for social-media posts undermining the government's vaccination strategy. After the court ruled against Djokovic on Sunday, Kelly, who now leads the minor, right-wing United Australia Party, tweeted: \"Human rights advocates &amp; believers in Australia as a 'free country' should be horrified.\"</p><p>Djokovic was initially detained after he arrived at a Melbourne airport on Jan. 5 and immigration authorities decided his vaccine exemption wasn't valid. On Monday, a court overturned the cancellation of his visa on technical grounds, freeing him to practice on the blue courts of Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena, before Mr. Hawke exercised his discretionary power as immigration minister to cancel the visa again.</p><p>Many Australians were incensed by Djokovic's attempt to gain an exemption from vaccination rules. Australia's total confirmed Covid-19 cases have climbed above 1.7 million, four times higher than the start of 2022, according to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data project.</p><p>Footage showing two television news anchors criticizing the tennis star, including one labeling him as lying and sneaky, was leaked online last week by a subtitling company employee. Seven West Media Ltd., one of Australia's largest media companies, said it would investigate the leak but didn't apologize for the remarks.</p><p>Australians have been living under extreme travel restrictions for most of the past two years. Tens of thousands of Australians were stranded abroad when officials shut the country's international border, severely restricting arrivals and barring locals from leaving until only recently.</p><p>Even within Australia travel was heavily curtailed, with lengthy restrictions on state borders that kept people from seeing family and friends for important events such as births and weddings. Sometimes new or tightened restrictions trapped people on the wrong side of state lines from their homes for weeks or months at a time.</p><p>Highlighting the sacrifices Australians have made during the pandemic, Morrison, the prime minister, said on Sunday that authorities were committed to Australia's tough border laws. \"Our government has always understood this and has been prepared to take the decisions and actions necessary to protect the integrity of our borders,\" he said.</p><p>Serbian President Alexander Vucic questioned why Australia didn't refuse Djokovic's visa or deport him immediately. \"Why do you harass him, why do you mistreat him, as well as his family and a nation that is free and proud?\" he said in a four-minute video posted on social media before the court's decision.</p><p>The saga has attracted world-wide attention. At times, more than 80,000 viewers were streaming Sunday's court proceedings on YouTube.</p><p>Djokovic was one of 26 players or coaches to apply for medical exemptions to the vaccination rules, Tennis Australia said, and one of a handful to receive one initially. However, since his case garnered widespread public attention, one women's player and one coach, both unvaccinated, have been deported.</p><p>Djokovic's application for a medical exemption from Australia's vaccination rules hinged on his infection with, and recovery from, Covid-19 in December. Immigration officials didn't accept his exemption, which was provided by Tennis Australia.</p><p>Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Hawke's attorney, said Djokovic could easily have agreed to receive a vaccine before that infection.</p><p>\"You should have the freedom to choose, to decide what you want to do. In this particular case, what you want to put in your body,\" Djokovic said in November at a tournament in Turin, Italy.</p><p>Djokovic could be almost 38 when he is next eligible to apply for an Australian visa. Australia's Ken Rosewall is the oldest man to win a grand slam tennis tournament, taking the 1972 Australian Open title at 37 years, 1 month and 24 days.</p><p>With Djokovic's rival Roger Federer currently recovering from knee surgery, this will be the first Australian Open held without either man since 1999. Djokovic was replaced in the first round by Italy's Salvatore Caruso, a so-called lucky loser from the qualifying tournament.</p><p>Rhiannon Hoyle in Adelaide, Australia, and Joshua Robinson in Paris contributed to this article.</p><p>Novak Djokovic in Australia</p><p>* Australia Feared Letting Novak Djokovic Stay Would Fuel Antivaccine Sentiment</p><p>* Australia Cancels Novak Djokovic's Visa Again</p><p>* Novak Djokovic Set to Play Fellow Serb in Australian Open as Visa Decision Looms</p><p>* Novak Djokovic Thrust to Center of Debate Over Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates</p><p>Write to Stuart Condie at stuart.condie@wsj.com</p><p>Novak Djokovic Deported on Eve of Australian Open After Court Upholds Visa Cancellation</p>",
