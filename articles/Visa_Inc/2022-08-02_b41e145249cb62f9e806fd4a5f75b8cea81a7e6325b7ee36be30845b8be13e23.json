  "title": "Former Allies Vie for Kenya's Presidency in Divisive Election; Memories of past election violence and voting irregularities hang over a tight poll in East Africa's economic hub",
  "text": "<p>But Raila Odinga, son of one of Kenya's revered independence leaders, and William Ruto, whose campaign slogan is \"every hustle matters,\" are both from a political elite in which alliances and enmities shift with the political moment. The two men once ran on the same ticket but now swap accusations of corruption in a country where winning office brings access to government spoils.</p><p>Polls suggest the Aug. 9 vote will be tight, a prospect that diplomats and analysts fear could tempt candidates to try to manipulate the results or mobilize supporters to reject them afterward.</p><p>\"We just hope that whoever loses accepts the results and tells their voters to accept also,\" said Leonard Wambugu, a 35-year-old salesman for Paladin Trading Ltd., a Nairobi security-technology company.</p><p>At stake are the fortunes of a bastion of relative stability and prosperity just as some of Kenya's neighbors, including Ethiopia and Somalia, are embroiled in conflicts and economic turmoil. Kenya is sub-Saharan Africa's fourth-largest economy and a location of choice for multinational powerhouses such as Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Visa Inc.</p><p>Still, some 3.5 million Kenyans, out of a population of 55 million, are going hungry as a result of an unprecedented regional drought and food and fuel inflation aggravated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>A key U.S. ally in Africa, Kenya deploys troops to Somalia to fight al Qaeda's local affiliate, al-Shabaab. American commandos operate from a base close to Kenya's Somali border. Nairobi is a hub for the United Nations and other aid agencies serving other parts of East Africa.</p><p>Power in Kenya changes hands through a multiparty political system, even if it does so in elections stained by fraud and, at times, ethnic violence. The 2017 poll had to be repeated after Kenya's supreme court annulled the initial result over irregularities.</p><p>\"This recent history has raised questions about Kenya's ability to hold free and fair elections—and the 2022 elections will provide a benchmark for how much progress has been made,\" according to a report by the Pentagon-funded Africa Center for Strategic Studies.</p><p>Western embassies are nervously watching for signs that might foreshadow a repeat of the violence that followed the disputed 2007 election, which left 1,100 people dead and forced another 600,000 from their homes, according to the International Criminal Court.</p><p>\"It's going to be a tense time around the elections,\" said Tom Molony, senior lecturer at the Centre of African Studies at the University of Edinburgh, who is in Kenya studying the role of polling-place observers.</p><p>A new poll by the TIFA Research company shows Mr. Odinga, 77, with a slight lead over the 55-year-old Mr. Ruto, 46.7% to 44.4% among self-described likely voters. Results are usually announced a few days after the balloting.</p><p>A third candidate, George Wajackoyah, 62, has sufficient support among young voters with his plan to legalize marijuana to potentially force an October runoff between the two leading candidates.</p><p>Political analysts say there is little space between the policies of Mr. Ruto and Mr. Odinga, whose appeal to their supporters seems more personality-driven, with the possibility of ethnic rivalries looming over the race.</p><p>President Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Kenya's founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, has reached his two-term limit and endorsed Mr. Odinga over his own deputy president, Mr. Ruto.</p><p>Mr. Ruto had been Mr. Odinga's running mate during the bloody 2007 election, when President Kenyatta supported the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki. When Mr. Kibaki won what many Kenyans saw as a fraudulent election, members of Mr. Odinga's and Mr. Ruto's ethnic communities—the Luo and Kalenjin respectively—clashed with the Kikuyu, the ethnic group of Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Kenyatta.</p><p>The International Criminal Court accused Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr. Ruto of crimes against humanity, but ultimately dropped the cases. Mr. Kenyatta tapped Mr. Ruto to be his running mate and defeated Mr. Odinga twice for the presidency before striking a deal with Mr. Odinga in 2018 that left his deputy president out in the cold.</p><p>Cyprian Nyamwamu, a political analyst backing Mr. Odinga, doesn't foresee nationwide violence, but notes that officials believe localized outbreaks are possible in 29 of 47 counties. \"Demonstrations may occasionally be violent, requiring police intervention,\" the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said Tuesday in a security alert for American citizens.</p><p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Ruto has suggested that Mr. Kenyatta is threatening to kill him, an allegation the president dismissed.</p><p>The growing animosity was evident when Mr. Odinga decided to sit out last week's presidential debate with Mr. Ruto.</p><p>\"He is a man who has no regards for ethics, public morals or shame,\" Mr. Odinga's spokesperson said of Mr. Ruto.</p><p>Mr. Ruto, alone on the debate stage, accused Mr. Odinga of \"dodging difficult questions he doesn't want to answer.\"</p><p>He accused Mr. Odinga—and implicitly Mr. Kenyatta—of abusing government power to influence the elections. \"They have very little regard for the people of Kenya,\" Mr. Ruto said. \"They think the deep state is going to make the decision.\"</p><p>Ordinary Kenyans meanwhile are struggling with rising prices. \"I appreciate that it's a worldwide problem and it's not individual to us,\" said Geoffrey Sendeu, 53, chief executive of Geoffrey's Travels, a tour company near Nairobi. \"But when I go around the country most people take it as a failure of government.\"</p><p>Mr. Odinga has promised to \"aggressively pursue debt relief negotiations\" on Kenya's $69 billion public debt, about half of it owed to China and other foreign creditors. Kenya has borrowed heavily from Beijing for rail, road and other infrastructure projects.</p><p>In his \"Hustler Nation\" campaign, Mr. Ruto has adopted the wheelbarrow as his symbol, a nod to young Kenyans who do odd jobs to get by. The unemployment rate among Kenyans age 18-34 is about 40%, according to the Africa Center.</p><p>Both leading candidates have voiced support for peaceful elections, even as their rhetoric has grown more heated.</p><p>Diplomats monitoring the situation haven't seen large numbers of people relocating in anticipation of ethnic strife. Such a shift took place before the 2017 election, with worried voters taking shelter in areas dominated by ethnic kinsmen.</p><p>Nor have there been reports of militia activity or fresh deployments of police units to potentially volatile areas, according to a Western diplomat. The European Union, African Union, U.S. and others plan to send observation teams to polling stations.</p><p>One wild card in the election is Mr. Odinga's choice of running mate: Martha Karua, 64, a former cabinet minister and the first woman to run on a major-party ticket.</p><p>Her clean-government message resonates with Kenyans who face daily reminders of the depth of public corruption, from police demanding bribes at traffic stops to bid-rigging at the top.</p><p>\"Moneys intended for public service are going into the pockets of corruption cartels who then become instant millionaires with huge bank balances,\" Ms. Karua said during the vice presidential debate.</p><p>Write to Michael M.
