Djokovic, who spoke against vaccine mandates as recently as November, said he believed he had an exemption from rules requiring travelers to the country to have received two shots of a Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>Djokovic had been scheduled to face fellow Serb Miomir KecmanoviÄ‡ on Monday in the Australian Open's opening round. He could instead be deported from Australia as early as Sunday and might be blocked from returning for three years, by which time he will be 37 and likely past his peak as a player.</p><p>Djokovic arrived in Australia as the country grapples with a surge in cases of Covid-19, which authorities had successfully contained until recently, in big part by closing the border.
