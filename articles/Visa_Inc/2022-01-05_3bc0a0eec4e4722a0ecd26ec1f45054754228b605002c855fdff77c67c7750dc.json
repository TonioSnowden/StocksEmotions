  "title": "Novak Djokovic's Arrival for Australian Open Delayed at Airport Amid Visa Confusion; The 20-time major champion had received a medical exemption to get around a ban on unvaccinated travelers before government authorities stepped in.",
  "text": "<p>The men's world No. 1, who has said he didn't want to be vaccinated, touched down only to discover that while Tennis Australia and local authorities had given him the green light, the Australian border authority required further documentation.</p><p>\"Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our strict border requirements,\" Australia's Home Affairs minister Karen Andrews said. \"While the Victorian government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.\"</p><p>Victoria's acting sports minister, Jaala Pulford, appeared to confirm Djokovic's rejection in a tweet late Wednesday night in Australia.</p><p>\"We will not be providing Novak Djokovic with individual visa application support to participate in the 2022 Australian Open Grand Slam,\" she tweeted.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear whether Djokovic, 34, could renew his application from inside the country to give himself a chance to participate, or if he would have to fly home to his primary residence in Monaco. He could not be reached for comment.</p><p>After months of speculation over his eligibility to enter the country as an unvaccinated person, Djokovic thought he was in the clear on Tuesday when he posted on social media that he was boarding a flight to Australia after receiving a medical exemption. But outrage built overnight while Djokovic seemed to be mid-air. The state of Victoria, where Melbourne is the capital, has spent much of the past 21 months under a strict lockdown.</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday that Djokovic would need to \"provide acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons\" to enter the country, despite tennis and border authorities already having given the green light.</p><p>\"If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else and he'll be on the next plane home,\" Morrison added. \"There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.\"</p><p>Djokovic, who contracted and recovered from Covid in the summer of 2020, was one of 26 players heading to the Australian Open to request a medical exemption. Only \"a handful\" received one after a blind review by two independent commissions, tournament director Craig Tiley said. \"For tennis players, it was a process that goes above and beyond what anyone l coming to Australia would have experienced.\"</p><p>Tournament organizers had earlier insisted that no one—not players, coaches, staff or fans—would be admitted without vaccination. But this week, it appeared to reverse course as a showdown loomed between the Australian Open and the most successful male player in its history.</p><p>\"Fair and independent protocols were established for assessing medical exemption applications that will enable us to ensure Australian Open 2022 is safe and enjoyable for everyone,\" Tiley said.</p><p>But Wednesday's confusion, first reported by Australia's The Age newspaper, appeared to stem from a lack of coordination over visas between local authorities, the federal government, and Djokovic's team.</p><p>With so much scrutiny on his vaccination status, Djokovic waited to travel to Australia later than most players ahead of the tournament's first round on Jan. 17. Most other players were already on the ground taking part in warm-up events and several expressed their surprise that he was on his way.</p><p>\"I don't know what to say about that,\" British doubles player Jamie Murray said after his match in the ATP Cup. \"I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated, I wouldn't be getting an exemption.\"</p><p>Write to Joshua Robinson at Joshua.Robinson@wsj.com</p><p>Novak Djokovic's Arrival for Australian Open Delayed at Airport Amid Visa Confusion</p>",
