  "text": "<p>2020 was an <em>annus horribilis</em> for Intel in terms of the Silicon Valley mainstay's fading technology leadership, but its prospects for 2021 and beyond suddenly look brighter.</p> <p>Last July, it was overtaken by Nvidia as the most valuable chip company in the US and its rival went on to buy Arm, designer of the chip architecture that most threatened Intel's business. Its manufacturing prowess then suffered a huge dent when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29e02e4f-df7f-49d7-8f94-00a5af481909\">revealed it was struggling</a> to reduce circuit widths on its chips to 7 billionths of a metre, when Taiwanese foundry TSMC had <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/tsmc-5nm-4nm-3nm-process-node-introduces-3dfabric-technology\">already surpassed</a> this next level of miniaturisation, moving on to the 5 nanometre node. </p> <p>It received a kick in the teeth in November when Apple<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7bc855d-0b22-4a6c-b38d-1938c297f08a\"> unveiled an Arm-based processor </a>that would replace Intel's in Macs and showed it could considerably outperform Windows PCs and laptops running on Intel chips. To add insult to injury, in December, the activist hedge fund Third Point <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afa50509-afbc-4e7c-b57d-ac74ccbc6e6f\">took a stake</a> and told Intel it was no longer “the gold standard” and should look at shedding its core manufacturing operations.</p> <p>Today, Third Point welcomed the news that chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6e30aca-e72b-4c49-8e8a-1bb25918c5c4\">Bob Swan would step aside</a> next month after holding the top job for just over two years. He will be replaced by Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VMware, on February 15.</p> <p>His successor is an outside hire with Intel inside. Mentored by Intel's legendary leader Andy Grove, Mr Gelsinger had earlier risen to be chief technology officer in a 30-year career at the chipmaker. “Having begun my career at Intel and learned at the feet of Grove, Noyce and Moore, it's my privilege and honour to return in this leadership capacity,” he said in a statement.</p> <p>An Intel-wired brain is needed to restore the company's fortunes, but there are already encouraging signs. The company previewed <a href=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/88226-intel-teases-core-i9-11900k-beating-ryzen-high.html\">its 11th-generation processors </a>at CES 2021 this week, including a Core i9 offering due in the first quarter. Figures out on Thursday should confirm Intel is still the world's biggest chipmaker by revenues and the company said today it had&#xa0;“made strong progress on its 7nm process technology”. It would give more details next week in an earnings report that should show strong demand for semiconductors. Third Point has been placated for now and Intel shares are up 7.5 per cent today.</p> <p>Yet Korea and Taiwan now lead on manufacturing in the shape of Samsung and TSMC, Japan has the world's fastest supercomputer, running on Arm-based chips, and China continues to prioritise building up its semiconductor industry. Intel needs Mr Gelsinger to improve the competitiveness of its technology, but so does the US.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. YouTube bans Trump, Airbnb bans DC stays</strong><br>YouTube has become the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f107a54-e70c-4a52-a26d-89fbb188bfbd?emailId=5ffedbc9a9d9e80004e6bf74&amp;segmentId=3934ec55-f741-7a04-feb0-1ddf01985dc2#o-comments-count:~:text=Separately%20on%20Tuesday%2C%20Google%2Downed%20YouTube%20became,Follow%20Demetri%20Sevastopulo%20on%20Twitter\">latest service to suspend</a> President Trump's account over fears he could incite further unrest ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration in a week's time. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60a72a7c-d312-4cd3-9256-a2a427d3cad3\">Airbnb is cancelling</a> all bookings in the Washington area. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e62f30dc-edbd-4037-b6d7-8cc0896bf414\">Emily Bell says</a> the incoming administration should borrow from Europe in enacting laws and frameworks to counter disinformation.

WhatsApp exodus follows T&amp;Cs changes</strong><br>Facebook is scrambling to deal with a sudden competitive threat to its messaging platform WhatsApp after a change to its terms of service sparked privacy concerns and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee1b716d-4ed2-4b26-8da1-40c98db7b9b6\">prompted users to turn to rivals</a> such as Signal and Telegram in droves. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b43e6685-f943-4c2f-91fb-89d62970bab5\">Our Brussels Briefing newsletter </a>says antitrust and privacy concerns about Big Tech will dominate in 2021.</p> <p><strong> 3.

Its shares opened above $90, making the company worth nearly $22bn. Visa has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e10a83d4-b651-4097-b867-a6b42e21fb09\">called off its deal</a> to buy fintech start-up Plaid for $5.3bn after the US Department of Justice&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03bbf74e-697b-4989-8942-98e6a327e87d\">sued to block</a>&#xa0;the transaction on competition grounds.&#xa0;Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4aae4d27-c150-4d18-9da3-9819815d5ae0\">Walmart is partnering </a>with a VC firm to create a fintech start-up.</p> <p><strong>4.

Jitse Groen, chief executive, said: “It's either all or it is nothing and we are going to go for all in the UK.” Private equity group <strong>Advent </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a44921-4266-461a-aecc-562b645f861e\">planning to list</a><strong> InPost, </strong>its Polish parcel locker business, on the Amsterdam stock exchange, in a move designed to cash in on the surge in online shopping.

The&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e264fd41-7ee9-4fba-be3c-21446298efd9\">lack of semiconductors</a>&#xa0;has affected carmakers across the world with Volkswagen, Nissan and General Motors all tapering production.
