  "title": "Banking & Finance: Merchants Back Bill to Cut Sway Of 2 Big Cards",
  "text": "<p>The merchants said the fees are passed along to consumers in higher prices.</p><p>\"Swipe fees for credit cards are higher in the United States than anywhere else in the industrialized world -- more than seven times as high as Europe,\" said the merchant group, which includes an assortment of small businesses such as gas stations, restaurants and grocers along with giant chain retailers. \"In 2021 alone, U.S. merchants and consumers paid nearly $138 billion in card fees.\"</p><p>The networks have said card fees help cover costs for things like innovation and preventing fraud. Credit cards can also encourage consumers to buy more, networks say.</p><p>Mr. Durbin championed a similar rule for debit cards more than a decade ago. The Durbin amendment, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, requires banks to enable at least two unaffiliated debit networks on each card.</p><p>\"The last time we saw a letter like this, retailers were lobbying for the Durbin amendment windfall they did not pass on to consumers, despite testifying that they would,\" said Jeff Tassey, chairman of the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card issuers and networks.</p><p>The bill would direct the Federal Reserve to issue regulations that would require large banks that issue credit cards to enable at least one alternate network that isn't affiliated with Visa or Mastercard. The rule would apply on Visa or Mastercard credit cards that are issued by banks with more than $100 billion in assets.</p><p>Most U.S. banks that issue credit cards pair up with one of the two major networks, Visa or Mastercard. The network is typically listed on the front or back of the card. When a shopper uses a credit card, the merchant pays a variety of fees, including an interchange fee that is set by the network and collected by the card issuer and a network fee that goes to Visa or Mastercard.</p><p>The two networks together handled roughly 77% of all general-purpose credit-card spending last year on cards issued in the U.S., according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.</p>",
