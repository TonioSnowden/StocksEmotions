  "title": "The Future of Everything: The Festival Issue --- Reshaping Work, Money: Shifts in benefits, investing are here to stay, says the global CEO of Monzo Bank",
  "text": "<p>Born in India, Mr. Anil has worked around the world at companies including Standard Chartered, Citigroup and Capital One. He was global head of payment products and platforms at Visa before joining Monzo in 2020.</p><p>He says he has spent much time in recent months considering where work is headed and how the financial-technology company's own workplace policies should evolve. Monzo this year rolled out a three-month paid-sabbatical program for staffers who have been at the company four years or more.</p><p>The company is also aiming to stay ahead of changes in the ways consumers manage their finances while competing with its larger bank rivals. Mr. Anil spoke with The Wall Street Journal about what he's focused on next.</p><p>WSJ: The job market right now is tight -- workers have more leverage, and employers have responded. Five years from now, will employees have as much power as they do today?</p><p>A: What has continued to change slowly over the last several years -- but then Covid quite possibly accelerated -- is the shift in mindset about what it means to work. People, increasingly, don't want their jobs to just be about, \"I go do this, and I get a paycheck.\" People want meaning from their work, people want the ability to work in ways that work around their lives effectively. That shift creates opportunity for companies like us who are leading the way in terms of understanding what employees want and are willing to not be anchored to a historical way of doing things. So, yeah, I don't think things go back in five years; this is an important cultural shift, and it's a welcome cultural shift.</p><p>WSJ: What are the new benefits companies will need to offer in the future to get employees to stay?</p><p>A: It's hard to speculate on specific benefits. At Monzo, we've always been about our values. One is this idea that you help everyone belong. And it means we come up with ways that we can institutionalize policy to make everyone get that sense of what works best for them. We announced additional paid leave for colleagues of ours who suffer pregnancy loss, or who are undergoing fertility treatments. This is one where it feels like this should have always been offered by companies.</p><p>WSJ: What was it that prompted you to offer paid sabbaticals?</p><p>A: We're now going on seven years old, and building a bank -- or really any kind of tech company -- and scaling it is a marathon, not a sprint. And we're at the stage where enough of our employees have put in a few years of incredibly hard work. It felt like a good time to give people the ability to take a break, recharge, come back with even more energy to continue this marathon that we're all excited to be on.</p><p>WSJ: What's the biggest change you expect to see in the banking industry in the next 10 years?</p><p>A: The biggest thing that I hope we see is making money work for everyone, which means really giving people the tools to make great decisions for themselves, to help them understand and make sense of their money. It's still amazing and sad how little customers around the world are supported in all decisions related to their money. It's such a source of anxiety for customers, that I'm hoping that, in the next decade, as an industry, we've solved that problem.</p><p>WSJ: Is there a specific shift you foresee in how people will manage their money?</p><p>A: What I aspire to for us is that across all of your financial needs -- whether it's spending, paying, transacting borrowing, saving, investing -- all of that happens in a single place. So as an individual trying to make sense of my money, I can see it all in one place; I can visualize it, I can analyze it.</p><p>WSJ: What are the challenges you feel the company will need to overcome to fulfill this vision?</p><p>A: It's important that we continue to evolve our culture for the scale that we're growing into. That's probably the single biggest one, to make sure that you preserve the best aspects of your culture -- what we internally describe as the golden threads. Keep the golden threads, let go of the stuff that's not working and keep evolving it. If you can get that right, then you can continue to scale and continue to have impact.</p><p>---</p><p>Interview has been condensed and edited.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
