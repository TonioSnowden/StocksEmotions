  "text": "<p>   The U.S. will make it easier for more Afghans to apply to come to the country as refugees, the State Department said Monday, following a rise in Taliban violence amid the U.S. troop withdrawal. </p><p>   The State Department's decision will make tens of thousands of Afghans eligible for priority treatment under a U.S. refugee resettlement program. </p><p>   Under the new criteria, tens of thousands of Afghans could be eligible for the program, U.S. officials told reporters on Monday, including Afghans who worked for U.S. government contractors, for U.S.-funded programs, or U.S.-based media or nongovernmental organizations, as well as their families. </p><p>   \"We take our responsibility to our Afghan partners deeply seriously, and we know the American people do as well,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters. </p><p>   The expanded program likely would exclude the poorest Afghans from making use of the new rules. Afghans that are referred to the program will need to apply from a third country, and cover the costs of travel and lodging on their own. </p><p>   The decision comes amid a rise in violence in Afghanistan. The Taliban swept through the northern provinces in early July, and have begun assaulting major cities in the south. </p><p>   The Afghan government has sent elite commando units backed by U.S. airstrikes to the cities of Kandahar, Herat and Lashkar Gah to stem the Taliban advance, but the fighting continues. </p><p>   Afghans applying for refugee status under the new criteria will need to be referred by a current or former employer, then relocate to a third country. </p><p>   Even with the expanded criteria, Afghans face numerous logistical and financial hurdles making it into the program. </p><p>   Many Afghans needing to travel to airports or borders to reach a third country risk getting caught in clashes between government and Taliban forces, as well as roadside bombs and crime. </p><p>   Some will need help filling out forms and might not have the resources to pay for translation or legal assistance. </p><p>   Processing times could extend beyond a year, raising questions about how applicants and families would survive in foreign countries without assistance while waiting for their applications to be adjudicated. </p><p>   U.S. officials on Monday said the U.S. has no plans to provide lodging or other aid to applicants. </p><p>   With the U.S. nearing the end of the troop withdrawal following nearly 20 years of armed conflict, the Biden administration has come under significant bipartisan pressure to do more to help Afghans that helped the U.S. during the war. </p><p>   The new rule vastly expands the number of Afghans eligible to come to the U.S. The existing Special Immigrant Visa program established in 2009 was available only to Afghans who worked directly for the U.S. government for a minimum two years. </p><p>   With the Taliban overtaking districts and advancing on provincial capitals, reports of brutality and summary executions have multiplied in the past two weeks. The Afghan government has said hundreds of people were either killed or disappeared in arrests when the Taliban seized the strategic border town of Spin Boldak in July. </p><p>   Last week, the first plane carrying more than 200 Afghan interpreters and their families immigrating under the SIV program arrived in the U.S. As many as 20,000 SIV visa applications remain in the process, according to the latest State Department quarterly report. </p><p></p>",
