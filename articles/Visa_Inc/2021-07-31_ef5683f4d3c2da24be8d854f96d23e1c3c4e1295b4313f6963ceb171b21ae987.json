  "text": "<p>Ambassador Tracey Ann Jacobson, who is leading the State Department task force on the evacuations, said Thursday it would be the first of many flights. She said further details couldn't be shared for security reasons.</p><p>\"We will learn from the experience of this first flight and apply it to future flights,\" Ms. Jacobson said. \"These folks have, in recent days, left their entire lives behind and immigrated to the United States with just their luggage.\"</p><p>In the coming weeks the U.S. plans to evacuate about 700 applicants who are in the final stages of applying for a Special Immigrant Visa.</p><p>Those applicants have already passed extensive background screening.</p><p>The Special Immigrant Visa program was established in 2009 to provide refuge to Afghans who performed \"sensitive and trusted activities\" for U.S. military, diplomatic or other personnel.</p><p>As many as 20,000 visa applications remain in the process, according to the latest State Department quarterly report. More than half of those are in the initial phases, which can take years to complete. Advocates of the program say tens of thousands more Afghans may be eligible.</p><p>The Afghans will be taken to Fort Lee, Va., where they will undergo a medical exam, one of the final steps in the application process.</p><p>As security in Afghanistan declined following the announcement of the U.S. departure earlier this year, the Biden administration came under pressure from Congress to do something to help Afghans who aided the U.S. during the war. In response, the State Department, in coordination with other government departments and agencies, launched what it calls \"Operation Allies Refuge.\"</p><p>The Senate on Thursday passed a bill that directs $1.1 billion in federal funds to aid the Afghan refugees. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who negotiated the bill with GOP Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, said the legislation will facilitate 8,000 new Afghan Special Immigrant Visas with changes to the program to improve efficiency.</p><p>Ms. Jacobson said that the evacuation would continue after U.S. troops have left Afghanistan.</p><p>Many of the Afghans are likely to be reunited with families and friends in existing communities of Afghan expatriates, where they continue to speak to each other in local languages and observe cultural and religious traditions.</p><p>\"We have our own culture in place here,\" said one Afghan who recently came to the U.S. through the process. \"Here we don't think we're in America, we think we're in Kabul.\"</p><p>The Afghan said life for his family of six was difficult at first. They lived first with relatives and later for years in a rented basement.</p><p>Now, he makes a living working as an assistant teacher and doing deliveries for DoorDash and Grubhub.</p><p>\"I know how to survive,\" he said. \"America is the land of opportunity.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.</p>",
