Amazon AMZNannounced it would no longer accept Visa V credit-cards issued in the U.K. starting in 2022 due to the “high cost of payments,” though Visa argued that its fees were competitive.</p><p>Amazon will also reportedly stop charging Visa users extra fees in Singapore and Australia.</p><p>Some analysts at the time said the move was possibly a negotiating tactic by Amazon, and could even push some consumers toward Mastercard MA or American Express AXPAXP.</p>",
