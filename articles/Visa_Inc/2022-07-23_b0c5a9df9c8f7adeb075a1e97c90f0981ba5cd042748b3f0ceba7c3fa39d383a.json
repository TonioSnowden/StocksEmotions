  "text": "<p>It felt, at times, as if the whole world was burning. As we sweated our own miserable paths through this week's extreme temperatures, Europe was ravaged by wildfires, more than 100 million Americans faced heat warnings and, here in the UK, swaths of public infrastructure — from railways to hospitals — collapsed (or literally melted).</p> <p>But when the going gets tough, FT journalists get going and we had no end of insightful reporting, analysis and comment to choose from for FT Edit.</p> <p>Henry Mance interviewed the level-headed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94475cf3-df95-41bf-bef4-06e76a4df7df\">climate scientist Corinne Le Quéré</a>, who skewered politicians for constantly “looking at what others are doing. This is paralysing. Everybody looks at what everybody else does, so action slows down”. </p> <p>Frans Timmermans, the EU's top climate official, was less sanguine in this apocalyptic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e52be5f-4091-4b38-8156-9e3e7f4e4bf3\">round-up of European catastrophe</a>: “We are almost reaching a point where Mother Earth is going to shed humanity as an old skin, rid itself of all of us.”<br><br>While our American readers might view Europe's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c393b139-e74f-49d8-a653-258c22fd6c28\">lack of air conditioning</a> as masochistic lunacy, Leslie Hook neatly summed up the Catch-22 in which we find ourselves: the simplest solution to warmer temperatures serves only to aggravate the problem. </p> <p>We also enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb9ecca3-c914-489d-af7d-06df6010d1ea\">this excellent piece</a> (with graphics to match) on the jet stream — the conveyor belt that delivers our weather and could be responsible for this week's simultaneous heatwaves across the world. </p> <h1>Our favourite pieces</h1> <p>• When I left China as a foreign correspondent at the end of 2014, the Belt and Road Initiative, a plan by Beijing to lend vast sums to developing countries to help them build new railways, roads, power stations and other infrastructure, was in full swing. </p> <p>Since then, some of the projects, collectively worth nearly $840bn, have been successes, such as the 750km railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti in Ethiopia. But some countries are struggling badly under the weight of the debt. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccbe2b80-0c3e-4d58-a182-8728b443df9a\">This article by a team of FT reporters</a> takes a forensic look at what has been hailed by Xi Jinping, as China's “project of the century”. <br><strong>Malcolm Moore</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalcolmMoore\"><em>(@malcolmmoore)</em></a> <br><em>Editor, FT Edit</em></p> <p>• As someone whose investments extend only as far as a few woefully underperforming stocks and shares Isas, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bce2ef2a-77d8-485e-ba69-92579f8fceb6\">this piece on young DIY traders</a> — who came of age during the 2008 recession — taking big risks in the hope of making outsized returns was both inspiring and horrifying. “If you had lottery tickets for houses, investors would buy some of those, too,” says one investment strategist. “There is enormous inequality, and when people get fed up . . . they start to behave in strange and new ways.”<br><strong>Hannah Rock</strong><br><em>Deputy editor, FT Edit</em> <em>(</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HannahRockFT\"><em>@HannahRockFT</em></a><em>)</em> </p> <h1>Something to listen to </h1> <p><strong>Hot Money</strong> — Episode 7: How OnlyFans changed and Episode 8: Inside porn's star chamber<br>On Tuesday the FT wrapped up Hot Money, our eight-part investigative podcast into the world of online porn and the businesses behind it. The last two episodes cover the rise of OnlyFans and the key role that Visa and Mastercard have in the industry. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10705061.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>FT Weekend podcast</strong> — How to change your mind<br>Martin Wolf, the FT's chief economics commentator, reflects on the things he got wrong and how he changed his opinions. Also, a chat with Courtney Weaver who wrote the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91918955-db14-4327-bda5-ab776926d15a\">article about gentle parenting</a> which we featured a few weeks ago. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10705147.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p> <strong>Behind the Money</strong> — Are big corporate profits to blame for inflation? <br><a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2022/06/22/companies-inflation-profit-maximization-supply-chain/\">A recent poll by Morning Consult</a> found that nearly a third of US consumers blame profit-chasing by companies for rising inflation. US business editor Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson talks to the Behind the Money Podcast about the politics of blaming business for making profits.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10705175.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h1>Something to watch</h1> <p>For most of us, access to financial services, like home or car insurance, are an essential part of living in the modern world. But for gypsies and travellers the task is almost impossible. Our latest FT film looks at the struggles these groups face in both society and in the financial world. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10705379.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: FT Edit Team 2022 'Something for the weekend: a few of our favourite things' FT.com 23 July.
