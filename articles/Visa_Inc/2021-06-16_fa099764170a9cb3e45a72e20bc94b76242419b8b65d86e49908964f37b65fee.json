  "title": "Visa Program's End Risks Project Funding",
  "text": "<p>The program's demise after almost 30 years would be a blow to the real-estate industry, which has come to rely on green-card applicants as a cheap source of funding. Developers of projects such as Brooklyn's Pacific Park and Steiner Studios relied on EB-5 funding to complete their visions. It isn't known whether existing investors could receive their green cards if the program expires.</p><p>Sens. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) have made a proposal that would more tightly regulate which foreign investors and investment projects could qualify under EB-5. The bill would include more stringent reporting requirements on the progress those investments are making.</p><p>They proposed a five-year extension of regional centers, which are set to expire at the end of the month and allow U.S. businesses to pool money from many EB-5 investors. The centers have made it possible to fund big real-estate projects. Mr. Grassley warned colleagues that he would prefer to see the program die rather than be reauthorized without changes.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) opposes the bipartisan bill, as do many in the real-estate and EB-5 industries. Industry representatives say they will agree to the proposed measures only if lawmakers make it easier for developers to raise money.</p><p>Messrs. Grassley and Leahy have long pushed to change the program, which they say is prone to fraud and which they believe allowed easy-to-get foreign capital to flow to urban areas rather than to more rural areas. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened a number of investigations into EB-5 projects for violating U.S. laws.</p><p>Some property developers and regional centers support the Grassley-Leahy bill. They want to avoid the risk of the program expiring, and the long reauthorization period would allow them to at least manage the money of existing EB-5 investors for many more years.</p><p>Other developers say the program has been essentially unusable since a federal rule in 2019 raised the minimum investment amount to $900,000 from $500,000 and took away the ability of states to gerrymander designated high-unemployment areas to make favored real-estate projects eligible.</p><p>On Thursday, three weeks shy of the program's expiration, Sens. Leahy and Schumer held a call with industry representatives where the groups tentatively agreed to try to find a compromise, according to two people who participated.</p><p>Some industry groups proposed shortening the extension from five years to one year to give them an earlier chance to renegotiate the program's rules.</p>",
