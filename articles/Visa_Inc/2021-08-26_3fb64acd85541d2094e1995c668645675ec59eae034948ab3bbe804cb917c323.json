  "title": "U.S. Hunting for Americans  As Afghan Deadline Closes In  ----  By Nancy A. Youssef, Saeed Shah and Courtney McBride",
  "text": "<p>   Facing an Aug. 31 deadline to leave Afghanistan, the U.S. must shift in a few days from evacuating thousands of Afghans and up to 1,500 Americans still in the country to the job of loading the remaining U.S. military personnel and essential equipment onto the final departing planes. </p><p>    The evacuation operation in Kabul is taking place under increasingly perilous conditions. The U.S. Embassy, citing terror threats, issued a security alert late Wednesday to tell Americans not to travel to Hamid Karzai International Airport and said those already there should leave. </p><p>   \"U.S. citizens who are at the Abbey Gate, East Gate, or North Gate now should leave immediately,\" the alert said. Officials have been warning that members of the Afghan branch of the Islamic State extremist group were trying to mount an attack on military personnel or civilians at the airport. </p><p>   The Biden administration on Wednesday provided its first count of American civilians in Afghanistan, saying up to 1,500 U.S. citizens remained in the country. </p><p>   U.S. officials are trying to evacuate 500 of the Americans, and are in contact with them, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the State Department. The status of another 1,000 civilian Americans is unclear, said Mr. Blinken, adding that U.S. officials were trying to contact them. </p><p>   He said some may not be U.S. citizens, others may have left the country already and some may be planning to stay. </p><p>   Approximately 4,500 Americans have been evacuated since the collapse of the Afghan government earlier this month, Mr. Blinken said. </p><p>   The estimate of the numbers of Americans evacuated and still in Afghanistan doesn't include lawful permanent U.S. residents, who are holders of green cards that entitle them to live and work in the U.S. </p><p>   Biden administration officials, meanwhile, outlined preparations for the likelihood that some Afghans and others seeking to leave will remain in the country after the last U.S. troops have left. </p><p>   \"They will not be forgotten,\" Mr. Blinken said, adding that the U.S. and its allies would \"ensure that those who want to leave Afghanistan after the 31st are able to do so.\" </p><p>   He said there was no deadline on U.S. efforts to help Americans and Afghans leave. </p><p>   \"That effort will continue every day past August 31st,\" he said. \"The Taliban have made public and private commitments to provide and permit safe passage for Americans, for third-country nationals, and Afghans at risk going forward past August 31st.\" </p><p>   Mr. Blinken said Taliban leaders have committed to allow people to continue leaving the country after the deadline next Tuesday, which is Aug. 31. He said the U.S. and other countries would hold the Taliban to that commitment. </p><p>   President Biden said Tuesday that he has asked the Pentagon and State Department to draft contingency plans for extending evacuation operations beyond the Aug. 31 deadline he had set earlier. Pentagon spokesman John. Kirby said the Pentagon was crafting those plans but wouldn't outline any of the possible scenarios. </p><p>   Mr. Kirby and other military officials said the evacuation operations would need to allow for the removal of military personnel and equipment before the Aug. 31 deadline. But they said the Pentagon is committed to evacuating Afghans until operations conclude, without saying when they would end or when the final military withdrawal would commence. </p><p>   \"We will have to reserve some capacity in those last couple of days to prioritize the military footprint leaving because we want to be able to keep it there as long as possible to do the job it is intended to do,\" Mr. John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. </p><p>   In a sign of the shift, Turkey began evacuating its soldiers from Afghanistan, the Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. Turkish troops had played a key role securing the Kabul airport. </p><p>   Over the past 24 hours, the U.S. evacuated 11,200 people on 42 cargo plane flights, the Pentagon said late Wednesday. In all, the U.S. has moved between 58,000 and 60,000 people since Aug. 14, and roughly 88,000 have left through U.S., allied, chartered and other flights combined, the Pentagon said. </p><p>   Many aid organizations have been told by Western governments that evacuation flights won't continue past Friday, as the U.S. military will need the days remaining until Tuesday to remove its own equipment and troops from Kabul. That guidance represented one sign that the window for Afghans desperate to leave the country is closing and that thousands of Afghans who want to leave likely will be stranded. </p><p>   Thick crowds gathered around the airport Wednesday as the clock ticked down to catch the last flights out. Many waved their travel papers or signs with their nationalities, hoping to attract the attention of the foreign troops controlling access checkpoints. </p><p>   One Afghan man, who didn't want to be identified because he feared for his safety, said he got through the Taliban check posts on the way to the airport with an invitation letter from a European country on Wednesday morning. He tried all day to get through the throng around the airport entrance gates, without success, and returned home after nightfall. </p><p>   He said he would try again Thursday. \"There were so many people there that, if you dropped a needle from the sky, it would not hit the ground,\" he said. </p><p>   One family with connections to the deposed Afghan government has been trying to leave Kabul since last Thursday, making at least two unsuccessful attempts to reach the gates despite communications from the U.S. Embassy saying their visas had been issued. On one occasion, the father, Mohammad, who had served in the Afghan military, had grown a beard and wore dirty clothes in hopes of going unrecognized by the Taliban, but was stopped. </p><p>   The second time, they endured hours in crushing throngs, waving their documents at American soldiers, to no avail, they said. </p><p>   \"This is no way to treat human beings,\" said Mohammad's daughter, Husnia. </p><p>   Mr. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. troops would continue flying out as many people as possible for as long as they can, and said no Afghan with a U.S. Special Immigrant Visa -- the type given to Afghans who worked for U.S. forces or agencies during the war -- would be left behind. </p><p>   \"We know there are a lot of desperate people who want to leave,\" Mr. Kirby said. </p><p>   In Kabul, the Taliban continued to try violently dispersing crowds at the airport, shooting in the air and using whips and chains. </p><p>   On Wednesday, footage of a man near the airport, bleeding from the head from an apparent beating from the Taliban as he pleaded that he is an Australian citizen, circulated on social media. </p><p>   Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban, said on Wednesday that Afghans with travel documentation would be allowed to fly out after Aug. 31. He reiterated that U.S. and allied troops should withdraw by that deadline. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Bojan Pancevski and Michelle Hackman contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
