  "title": "Business News:  Card Fees Add to Merchant Pain  Amid Covid-19 Shopping Slump  ----  By AnnaMaria Andriotis",
  "text": "<p>    Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are planning to raise swipe fees for some types of credit-card purchases in April, adding to the squeeze felt by restaurants, retailers and other merchants already struggling through the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>   What is more, customers' switch to online shopping during the pandemic -- a trend heralded for keeping businesses afloat when people are reluctant to venture inside stores -- is also creating extra costs for merchants. Swipe fees, which merchants pay when a customer pays by card, are often higher on online purchases. </p><p>   The swipe fees, known as interchange fees in industry parlance, are a perpetual source of contention between merchants and card companies. Though invisible to consumers, they are glaring to merchants, which often end up paying fees of about 2% of their customers' credit-card purchases. The fees are set by the card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard. Merchants pay them to the banks that issue the cards. </p><p>   Cash use as a share of U.S. payments has been declining for years, but merchants say Covid-19 has accelerated the shift. Even customers who are shopping in stores are shunning cash during the pandemic, which also means more swipe fees for businesses. </p><p>   Savage Race, a small business that organizes obstacle-course races, has seen sales plummet during the coronavirus. To help persuade counties to let it keep hosting events, company executives told local officials they would stop accepting cash. </p><p>   \"We didn't want to,\" said Sam Abbitt, the chief executive of Savage Race. \"It was one more frictional cost of Covid.\" </p><p>   Before the pandemic, about half of the payments Savage Race received at events were in cash, the method that Mr. Abbitt prefers because he doesn't have to shell out for swipe fees. \"I think people like to get credit-card rewards, and it's convenient for them to not have to carry physical cash around,\" Mr. Abbitt said. But for him, \"as a business owner, I like to receive cash.\" </p><p>   Card-industry executives say interchange fees help cover costs for important functions such as innovation and preventing fraud. They point out that the chances of fraud are higher with online purchases, which is partly why online swipe fees are often higher. Fraudulent online card transactions, which can result in more costs for merchants, jumped last year, according to industry data. </p><p>   While total retail sales, excluding cars and gasoline, increased 0.3% from March 2020 through January from the same period a year earlier, online sales increased 57%, according to Mastercard's SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all payment forms. </p><p>   Companies are also paying more in debit-card interchange fees. Debit has become a more popular payment option in the past year, with people wary of taking on debt in an uncertain economy. </p><p></p>",
