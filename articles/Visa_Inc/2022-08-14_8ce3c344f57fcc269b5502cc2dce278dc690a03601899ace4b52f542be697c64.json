  "title": "Salman Rushdie Is Talking After Being Taken Off Ventilator, Family Says; The celebrated writer is showing signs of improvement two days after he was stabbed at an upstate New York event",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Rushdie was taken off a ventilator over the weekend and is breathing on his own, his son Zafar Rushdie said in a statement.</p><p>\"We are extremely relieved,\" he said, while adding that Mr. Rushdie, 75 years old, still needs extensive medical treatment.</p><p>\"He was able to say a few words,\" said Zafar Rushdie. \"Though his life-changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty and defiant sense of humor remains intact.\"</p><p>Authorities have charged Hadi Matar, 24 years old, of Fairview, N.J., with the attack.</p><p>Mr. Matar was transferred to New York State Police barracks after he was apprehended in the amphitheater on the Chautauqua Institution grounds. He invoked his right to legal counsel when officers began questioning him about the attack, according to Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt.</p><p>The suspect is believed to have traveled to the Buffalo area from northern New Jersey on a bus the day before the attack, then hired a car to bring him to Chautauqua, Mr. Schmidt said.</p><p>He wasn't carrying a wallet when he was apprehended but he did have more than one prepaid Visa card, cash and a New Jersey driver's license that bore someone else's name, Mr. Schmidt said.</p><p>The suspect had two day passes with him to Chautauqua events, one which had expired and one that was valid for Friday, the DA said.</p><p>Mr. Matar was arraigned Saturday and charged with second-degree attempted murder. He was also charged with second-degree assault for injuring another speaker who was on stage with Mr. Rushdie. He pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail at the Chautauqua County Jail.</p><p>Mr. Matar's lawyer on Sunday said the case against his client was still very preliminary.</p><p>\"Mr. Matar benefits from the presumption of innocence, a fair trial and due process, as does every individual in our country,\" said attorney Nathaniel L. Barone.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie sustained three stab wounds to his right front neck and four stab wounds in the stomach, according to the district attorney. He had a puncture wound in his right eye and two in his chest, the DA said.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie suffered a damaged liver and severed nerves in an arm, his agent, Andrew Wylie, said Friday in an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. He is also likely to lose an eye.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders called for his execution over his 1988 novel \"The Satanic Verses.\"</p><p>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran's 1979 revolution, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, in 1989 that called on Muslims to kill Mr. Rushdie. A private Iranian foundation offered a multimillion-dollar bounty to anyone who killed Mr. Rushdie.</p><p>In 1998, Iran's reformist President Mohammad Khatami appeared to lift the vendetta, telling reporters at a meeting of the United Nations in New York that the threat against Mr. Rushdie was \"completely over\" after he had lived in hiding under an assumed name for nine years.</p><p>But Mr. Khomeini's successor as Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in 2005 that the fatwa was still valid. Mr. Khamenei remains in power.</p><p>Iranian officials haven't said anything publicly about Mr. Rushdie's attacker. Some local press outlets have praised Mr. Matar, including the Kayhan newspaper, which is closely aligned with Mr. Khamenei.</p><p>Mr. Schmidt said the suspect has no known prior criminal history. At the moment, Mr. Schmidt said, authorities have yet to determine a motive for the attack on Mr. Rushdie or establish a link to the fatwa against him.</p><p>\"I understand there are other law enforcement agencies at the federal level that are looking at this and on the state level through the New York State Police [they] are looking at this\" said Mr. Schmidt. \"I don't think that conclusion has been reached yet.\"</p><p>Mr. Rushdie was on stage Friday with fellow speaker Henry Reese, co-founder of the City of Asylum residency program for writers living under threat of persecution.</p><p>They planned to discuss the U.S. as a place of asylum for writers and other artists in exile and as a home for freedom of creative expression as part of the Chautauqua Institution's summer lecture series.</p><p>Mr. Reese, 73 years old, suffered a head wound in the attack.</p><p>The two men were aided by security and people from the crowd, who rushed to restrain the attacker. A doctor in the crowd was able to give immediate medical help to Mr. Rushdie, police said.</p><p>Zafar Rushdie in his statement said he thanked everyone for the outpouring of support his father has received.</p><p>\"We are so grateful to the audience members who bravely leapt to his defense and administered first aid along with the police and doctors who have cared for him,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Ginger Adams Otis at Ginger.AdamsOtis@wsj.com</p><p>Salman Rushdie Is Talking After Being Taken Off Ventilator, Family Says</p>",
