  "text": "<p>The late summer lull that overtakes Wall Street is even making bitcoin drowsy.</p><p>Bitcoin's price stalled right at $50,000 during its August rally. On Wednesday, the cryptocurrency settled at $48,279.42, before briefly crossing $50,000 on Thursday.</p><p>Bitcoin is renowned for its volatility. It more than doubled from January through mid-April, falling about 52% in the next three months and bouncing about 65% from July to August.</p><p>So what is keeping bitcoin treading water now? For one, investors are moving to other corners of the crypto market.</p><p>Ethereum funds had inflows of $22.4 million in August, according to CoinShares. And funds focused on Cardano—a blockchain platform similar to Ethereum—had inflows of $18.7 million. On Wednesday, Ethereum rose 10% to $3,730, its highest level since May 15. It has quintupled so far this year.</p><p>Nonfungible tokens spiked in the spring, and are surging now, drawing money away from bitcoin. NFTs are digital assets similar to bitcoin, with the difference that each is unique.</p><p>On OpenSea, the biggest exchange for NFTs, trading volume has been $3.5 billion over the past 30 days, according to data from research site DappRadar. Before August, it had a total of about $1 billion in trading volume since its founding in 2016.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which factors do you think have most slowed bitcoin's rise? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Also, recently, two blue-chip U.S. companies—Visa Inc. and Facebook Inc.—both took a step into the NFT market. Visa purchased a \"CryptoPunks\" NFT, and Facebook said it is considering building services for NFTs in its forthcoming digital wallet service.</p><p>That is the kind of big-name news that used to drive bitcoin, and it might need to recapture those kinds of headlines to rebuild its momentum.</p><p>Bitcoin's August's rally didn't attract many new buyers. The cryptocurrency's funds had outflows of $61 million in August, according to data from asset manager CoinShares, and outflows in 14 of the past 16 weeks.</p><p>In a note, Bret Oliver, an analyst at Momentum Structural Analysis, wrote that bitcoin's trading pattern since its April high resembles what happened after the 2017 peak.</p><p>In 2017, the price reached about $20,000, fell sharply over the next three months, and then spent more than a year in an extended downturn before the next rally started.</p><p>This downturn doesn't necessarily have to last as long as the last one, he said, but he expects the market will be stuck in a range after this year's selloff before building a new base. That means even if the July low holds, the recovery will be a drawn-out process, Mr. Oliver said.</p><p>Write to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com</p><p>Why Bitcoin's Price Got Stuck at $50,000</p>",
