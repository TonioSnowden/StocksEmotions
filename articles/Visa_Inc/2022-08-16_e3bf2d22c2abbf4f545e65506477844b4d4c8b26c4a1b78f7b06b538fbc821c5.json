  "title": "World News: Kenya Says Vice President Won Election --- Melee breaks out as several senior officials question the vote count, calling it opaque",
  "text": "<p>Shortly before the results were announced, Mr. Odinga's campaign alleged the vote had been corrupted. Four out of seven top elections officials disassociated themselves from the vote count, calling it opaque.</p><p>Odinga supporters attacked the chairman of the electoral commission, Wafula Chebukati, as he made his first attempt to reveal the results, with one throwing a chair in his direction on the podium. Police had to form a cordon around Mr. Chebukati, who later said two other commissioners were injured in the melee.</p><p>The uproar raised the spectre of past Kenyan elections that ended in ethnic and partisan violence. More than 1,000 people died following the disputed 2007 elections and the 2017 vote had to be repeated after Kenya's Supreme Court found significant irregularities.</p><p>In a peace offering, Mr. Ruto, 55, thanked Mr. Odinga, who didn't attend Monday's results announcement, and nodded to \"my boss,\" departing President Uhuru Kenyatta. In an unusual twist, Mr. Kenyatta had backed his former rival, the 77-year-old Mr. Odinga, over his own No. 2 in last week's vote.</p><p>\"I want to promise that I will work with all elected leaders and all leaders in Kenya so that we can fashion a country that leaves nobody behind,\" Mr. Ruto said.</p><p>Mr. Odinga's campaign now has the option of appealing to the country's supreme court for a review of the results.</p><p>\"It is not over till it is over,\" Mr. Odinga's running mate, Martha Karua, tweeted.</p><p>The breakaway electoral commissioners held a press conference shortly before the results were unveiled, saying they \"cannot take ownership\" of the announced outcome. \"We urge Kenyans to be peaceful because the rule of the law is going to prevail,\" said Juliana Cherera, vice chair of the electoral body and one of the dissenting commissioners.</p><p>Saitabao Ole Kanchory, Mr. Odinga's chief elections agent, told reporters that he considered electoral headquarters a crime scene. \"A result that is not verifiable is not a result,\" Mr. Kanchory said.</p><p>Kenyans have been on edge as the electoral commission has slowly tallied the results in the days since the Aug. 9 voting. The streets of Nairobi have been unusually empty, with public schools ordered closed for the safety of the children and some businesses shut or reducing inventories in case of looting. Workers who did show up for their jobs raced home as the announcement neared.</p><p>Police in riot gear patrolled sections of the mostly deserted streets of Nairobi after nightfall. There were scattered reports of violence, as well as celebrations by Ruto supporters.</p><p>International observers had deemed the voting itself overwhelmingly peaceful and praised a system that allowed citizens to count votes themselves through polling-station results posted online.</p><p>Kenya is an economic powerhouse and pillar of relative stability in East Africa. Major international companies, such as Alphabet Inc. and Visa Inc., have picked the country as a regional base of operations. It is also a key U.S. ally in the long-running military campaign against Islamist militants. American commandos based in eastern Kenya commute to Somalia to assist local forces fighting al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate.</p><p>Kenya's economy, however, has been pummeled by Covid-19, high global food and fuel prices and an unprecedented regional drought.</p>",
