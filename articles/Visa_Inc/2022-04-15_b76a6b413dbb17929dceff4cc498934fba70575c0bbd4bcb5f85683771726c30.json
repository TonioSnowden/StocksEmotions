  "text": "<p>Higher costs are \"the last thing American families deserve right now,\" wrote Mr. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. The letter, which was reviewed by the Journal, was also signed by Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, Democratic Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont, and Republican Rep. Beth Van Duyne of Texas.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you prefer paying with cash or card? Did your payment preferences change during the pandemic? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The fees the lawmakers referenced aren't paid directly by consumers. Instead, clothing stores, restaurants and other merchants pay so-called interchange fees whenever a customer pays by card.
