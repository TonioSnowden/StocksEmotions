  "title": "U.S. News: Virus-Related Travel Restrictions, Visa Backlogs Strain Companies",
  "text": "<p>Since he was hired in 2018, Mr. Ryder had been flying back and forth between Lenox's Bristol, Pa., headquarters and Denmark, where his wife and 23-year-old son live. Last year he received waivers from the U.S. government so he could attend his father's funeral, a family reunion and his 25th wedding anniversary and return to the U.S. Most Europeans, even those with visas, are banned from entering the country.</p><p>But in March of this year, on another trip home, Mr. Ryder, who holds an O-1 extraordinary ability visa, got stuck in Denmark. The U.S. State Department's waiver rules had tightened, eliminating an exemption for top executives as part of an effort to discourage travel, and he wasn't allowed to return. He gave his notice the following month.</p><p>\"It was a direct result of tightening the travel-ban criteria,\" Mr. Ryder said in an interview. \"If you're vaccinated and you can present a negative test, I don't see why you shouldn't be let back in.\"</p><p>Lenox didn't respond to requests seeking comment. The exemption for executives was recently reinstated, but after Mr. Ryder had resigned.</p><p>Although federal officials have eased Covid-19 restriction guidelines, the U.S. has kept travel bans on 33 countries, including the U.K., much of Europe, China and India. Citizens of those countries for the most part aren't being granted work visas even if they are vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19.</p><p>In countries that aren't banned, monthslong backlogs at consulates make it difficult for foreign workers to get visas. Of the 223 U.S. consulates that normally process work visas, 160 are currently accepting appointments, the State Department said.</p><p>Julie Stufft, who heads visa services for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, said most consulates abroad must limit service because of the pandemic, and the government is aware that reduced visa processing and the limited granting of exemptions have caused disruptions. The State Department has prioritized helping American citizens and people applying to immigrate rather than work temporarily.</p><p>\"A lot of this is wrapped up in maintaining safety in our facilities abroad,\" Ms. Stufft said.</p><p>Regions of the country that are centers for summer recreation but have small populations -- such as Wisconsin Dells, Wis., and Cape Cod, Mass. -- are normally dependent on foreign labor. Restaurant and resort owners can't rely on those workers this year, and they have been reducing service despite surging demand from pandemic-weary customers.</p><p>Cedar Point, an amusement park in northern Ohio, has been closing two days a week because of the worker shortage, said Richard Zimmerman, chief executive of the park's parent, Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. The park usually sponsors about 1,500 foreign college students to staff its rides and concession stands each summer, but it has gotten only a few hundred foreigners this year, he said.</p><p>\"It's the most challenging labor market I think I've seen in the last 20 years,\" Mr. Zimmerman said.</p><p>Greg Dugal, director of government affairs at Hospitality Maine, which represents businesses along Maine's coastline, said in more-remote areas, foreign workers would normally make up 50% to 60% of the workforce.</p><p>\"In some of these places, even if every man, woman and child came to the pump, it still wouldn't be enough,\" he said. \"People are fighting over each other's employees.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Eric Morath contributed to this article.</p>",
