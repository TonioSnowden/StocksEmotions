  "text": "<p>Notice something extra on your restaurant tab?</p><p>Rather than raise menu prices, restaurants are using new fees and surcharges to stick inflation into the fine print.</p><p>Fees for a \"noncash adjustment,\" \"fuel surcharge,\" or \"kitchen appreciation\" have been showing up on more bills lately. Industry analysts say this wave of surcharges is mostly being driven by restaurants trying to cope with the impact of rising inflation and a tight labor market on their bottom lines. In addition, Mastercard and Visa in April raised transaction fees for many merchants.</p><p>Lightspeed, a global developer of point-of-sale software, said fee revenue nearly doubled from April 2021 to April 2022, based on a sample of 6,000 U.S. restaurants that use its platform. The number of restaurants adding service fees increased by 36.4% over the same period.</p><p>\"As the costs of doing business have changed, we've seen more merchants leverage this tactic,\" said Peter Dougherty, Lightspeed's general manager of hospitality.</p><p>The practice is similar to shrinkflation, when snack-food companies reduce the size of packaging or portions to make it harder to spot a price increase.</p><p>The fees are effective in part because unless people are paying close attention, many fail to notice them. When the bill arrived following a mid-April dinner at Romano's Macaroni Grill, Lizzie Stephens was about to grab her wallet to pay. Instead, she pulled out her phone to Google the \"temporary inflation fee\" she noticed had been added to her check.</p><p>\"I was just like—wow, now we're getting fees at a restaurant, too?\" said Ms. Stephens, 34 years old, who lives in the Stockton, Calif., area.</p><p>The charge was $2. She said it added to her overall annoyance about higher prices. Her landlord had just raised her rent by $150 in March. A single mom of two, she had just taken on a part-time gig to supplement her income.</p><p>The restaurant chain wasn't immediately available for comment. Its website includes the following statement: \"A temporary $2 fee will be added to offset macroeconomic pressures.\"</p><p>The new fees aren't limited just to restaurant menus. CardX, a software vendor that allows merchants to pass along credit-card swipe fees to consumers as surcharges, had 2,600 clients as of November. The biggest areas of growth other than restaurants were general contractors and lawyers.</p><p>\"These are the more cost-sensitive verticals that have a huge demand or need to pass through their credit-card transaction fees against this backdrop of the rising costs,\" said Jonathan Razi, founder and chief executive of CardX. The company was acquired in November by Stax, a payments technology company that recently raised $245 million in funding—another indication of businesses' demand for help adding surcharges.</p><p>Inflation and the pandemic posed particular challenges for the restaurant industry. The average price of supplies for a restaurant operator increased by 17.5% since last year, according to NPD Group. By comparison, consumer spending at restaurants rose 5% during that time.</p><p>The increase in surcharges is a way for businesses to recoup at least some of those costs, said David Portalatin, a food-industry adviser with the group. Customers often seem to be more willing to accept the surcharges than outright price increases, he said. One restaurant operator recently tried raising the price of a signature sandwich, which resulted in a 6% decline in sales of that particular item, he said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are your tips for minimizing the effects of inflation on your everyday purchases?

The fee has since evolved into a strategy to offset inflationary pressures and remain competitive in a tight labor market, said Mr. Reding, who is weighing raising the wellness fee to 5% in the fall.</p><p>\"We'll see if this supply-chain mess straightens out a bit, see if the labor pool comes back at all,\" said Mr. Reding. \"If costs continue to escalate, part of our strategy is gonna be to figure out new and added benefits that we can add to retain the people we have and try and attract new people from other hospitality ventures.\"</p><p>Kathy Sidell, owner of Boston-based seafood restaurant Saltie Girl, added a \"kitchen appreciation fee\" earlier in the pandemic, in part to create an incentive for employees to come back to work, she said. It has since become a tool to maintain pay parity between the front and back of house staff as costs rise. The fee adds $5 an hour, per employee, she said. The restaurant has yet to raise prices on its menu, and Ms. Sidell doesn't plan to.</p><p>\"Our costs have increased exponentially, but there's just a certain amount that someone's going to pay for a lobster roll,\" she added.</p><p>Ms. Sidell said she rarely gets complaints about the fee. Mr. Reding said customers sometimes express umbrage toward the idea of subsidizing their servers' healthcare.</p><p>\"It's a difficult industry because you have a lot of entry-level and transient employees,\" he said.</p><p>The best way for consumers to navigate these surcharges is to be on the lookout for them, financial advisers say.</p><p>Kristen Euretig, a certified financial planner and founder of Brooklyn Plans, said that people often exclude additional fees—including gratuity—from entertainment expenses, which can throw a wrench into their budgeting. It helps to look at the menu costs ahead of time when dining out, she said, or to double the cost of your entrée to get a more accurate estimate of what you'll pay.</p><p>\"The more you know as a consumer, the more empowered you are to make decisions in your best interests,\" said Ms. Euretig.</p><p>Restaurant patrons can ask politely about exorbitant or unreasonable fees—some, such as Saltie Girl, will remove certain surcharges upon request.</p><p>Write to J.J.
