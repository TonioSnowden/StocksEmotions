  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>When I was a young reporter I vowed never to become an IT writer. Journalism is, among other things, a way of getting free tickets for a good show. International capital markets represented better entertainment than computing. They had crazy numbers, crazier characters and every deal reflected a real-world issue. Writing about the clunky PCs popping up in offices was a niche best left to scribes who knew their RAM from ROM.</p> <p>These days every business journalist is an IT writer. Almost every aspect of commercial life is being digitised.</p> <p>One indicator is that around half of Lex's output this week has been about technology. Digital disruption is central to current debates about valuation, a subject I touched on last week. We are in a short-term asset bubble that has puffed up the price of many stocks. But we are also living through a long technological revolution that is creating huge value. Investors have to reconcile both trends.</p> <p>The chart below illustrates the conundrum. It accompanied a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e49bd9b-3890-43dd-9ad1-0a226f0ab3f8\">Lex note on Wise</a>, the London-listed remittances start-up. It shows market value as a multiple of sales alongside estimated revenue growth. A bunch of payments businesses of varying maturities and market power are included for comparison.</p> <p>The chart is revealing for a couple of reasons. First, it shows that investors have pretty well given up on Western Union and MoneyGram, once-mighty money agents which still deal heavily in cash. What is striking is not that Wise is so highly valued — as a fast-growing start-up you would expect that. More startlingly, Mastercard and Visa are right up there with it. These are mature businesses. But they also wield huge network advantages that insulate them from disruption.</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that many significant businesses are omitted from the chart, because payments is only one strand of their activity. These are the high-charging correspondent banks that remittances start-ups such as Wise are marginalising.</p> <p>Square, best known for its point-of-sale devices, figures on the chart as a disrupter. Jack Dorsey has made the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25aeb161-7946-4196-84fe-9b415c4af5e9\">right choice</a> in relinquishing the role of chief executive at Twitter to focus on running the US payments group. It is worth more than double that of the short blogs website, beloved by politicians, journalists and other over-sharers. </p> <p>Square has far greater growth potential, assuming that the digression into crypto signalled by its name change to Block does not end catastrophically.</p> <p>But Square's valuation of six times sales looks positively staid compared with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa50288f-97a6-47fc-a3cf-41ed3341d8ce\">prospective IPO price</a> of 56 times revenues for Nubank. And that comes after the Brazilian fintech downsized its projected worth from $50bn to $40bn. Tech stocks have been wobbly in the week when the Federal Reserve admitted that high inflation would not, after all, be “transitory”.</p> <p>Incumbents rationally respond to tech disruption by getting into the game themselves. AJ Bell, a fast-growing UK DIY investment platform, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/965170f7-4aec-432a-8ff4-5030cddefebb\">setting up Dodl</a>, a cheap, mobile-only dealing service targeted at younger customers. Robinhood of the US makes an obvious role model. But UK brokers cannot sell their order flows so there is a 0.15 per cent management charge instead.</p> <p>Walmart has also learnt from rivals. The US retailer has survived the decimation of US physical retail and now fights Amazon on its own ground, with a sales website for a growing army of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69fc8707-ff62-4ab8-aebb-0f6d0c2d0c18\">third-party vendors</a>.</p> <p>Share trading digitised long ago, but stock markets themselves still preserve conventions created for human brokers rather than the automated kind. These include fixed trading hours and, in some financial centres, lunch breaks.</p> <p>Disgruntled with London's dwindling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/847b0335-7835-4b4f-9dc6-39ba944baadc\">“Jurassic Park”</a> of mature businesses, hedge fund boss Paul Marshall this week suggested world equities would eventually be traded 24 hours a day from New York. His point was underlined by the proposed £1.2bn buyout of Blue Prism, an unloved automation software group, by a US competitor.</p> <p>Lex thinks a 24/7 global electronic stock exchange is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b250de1-a05d-4ef7-b0cb-5e0aeaded68d\">great idea</a>. It could increase liquidity, cut costs and sharpen price discovery. There are only a few modest obstacles: heightened systemic risks, potential regulatory chaos and furious opposition from nations desperate to preserve local bourses as prestige institutions.</p> <p>China, for example, has pushed hard for local businesses to switch their listings from New York to exchanges in greater China. Ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing agreed to do so on Friday. </p> <p>China is also hoping to spawn multiple locally quoted businesses specialising in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bae5c88-8f31-42b2-9e04-0f56958ab917\">artificial intelligence and big data</a>. The government wants to build an industry turning over almost $500bn a year. That should energise a lacklustre sector including the likes of Zhongchang Big Data and Cambricon.</p> <p>A lack of data privacy makes big data experiments easier in China, but raises ethical questions for western investors. The tendency of Chinese authorities to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/549379ff-a2e6-41d5-9763-3094adccf72a\">beat up</a> tech businesses deemed too big for their boots is another discount factor.</p> <p>Investing in tech anywhere in the world is tricky. Lex reckons valuations are set to drop amid broader inflation-related market stumbles over the next year or so. But the fundamental question for investors remains this: will a new technology fly or flop? Making that call involves belief as well as technical savvy.</p> <p>It is easier to spot humdrum, conventional businesses unconvincingly camouflaged as tech start-ups. US company Sweetgreen has got to a $4bn valuation by calling itself a “platform”, as Elaine Moore <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daa00dcb-695b-419a-8610-4c30c2744b62\">pointed out</a> in Lex's Midweek newsletter. It makes and sells salads.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend free from too many electronic interruptions. Tech has invaded business. It does not need to invade our home lives too.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong><br><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2021 'Best of Lex: every business is a technology business now' FT.com 3 December.
