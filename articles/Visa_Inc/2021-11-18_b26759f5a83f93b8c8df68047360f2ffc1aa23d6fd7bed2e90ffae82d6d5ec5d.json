Higher-than-expected consumer price rises could prompt central banks to abruptly lift interest rates, raising the risk of a price correction, it said. The central bank also noted increased investor demand for riskier assets.

Since then, Fed purchases of Treasury debt have funded as much as 60% to 80% of the entire government borrowing requirement. In other words, Fed actions have crowded out private-sector price discovery for more than 10 years, pushing yields to lows and stock prices to record highs. The consequence of this blurred line between Fed and Treasury responsibilities—\"monetizing the debt\"—is inflation.</p><p>Mr. Goodman is president of the Center for Financial Stability.</p><p>The Federal Reserve Needs to Remove Its Blinkers</p><p>The Fed's latest policy statement reveals a dogged determination to accommodate despite increasing evidence of economic recovery, strong demand for labor and rising inflation, Judy Shelton writes for WSJ Opinion.</p><p>Chairman Jerome Powell seems eager to urge patience on raising interest rates for the sake of increasing labor participation.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, declined to 260,000 in the week ended Nov. 13, from 267,000 a week earlier. The Labor Department releases claims data at 8:30 a.m. ET today.</p><p>Global supply-chain bottlenecks are creating headaches for retailers, delays for consumers—and big gains for financial firms that invested in container ships before the pandemic upended the logistics business.</p><p>Fitch Ratings affirmed its BBB- sovereign rating and stable outlook on Mexico, citing \"stable and robust external finances,\" and noting that Mexico's debt-to-GDP ratio has increased less than those of other triple-B-rated countries. On the downside, the ratings firm said limited fiscal spending to address the pandemic could constrain future growth and employment, while government policy intervention affects investment prospects. Fitch forecasts economic growth for Mexico of 5.9% this year and 2.8% in 2022. (Dow Jones Newswires)</p>",
