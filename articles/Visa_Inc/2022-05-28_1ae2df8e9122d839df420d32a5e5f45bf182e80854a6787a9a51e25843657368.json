  "text": "<p>   Golf fans tend to have strong opinions about Phil Mickelson. Some see him as upbeat and smart, an entertaining talent unafraid to take risks on the golf course or let outsiders know what's on his mind. Others see him as a phony, a show-off who thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. In Alan Shipnuck's \"Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!) Biography of Golf's Most Colorful Superstar\" (Avid Reader, 249 pages, $30), both sides will find plenty to support their views. </p><p>   The book created a stir in February, three months before publication, when Mr. Shipnuck leaked quotes from Mickelson about a proposed new golf tour bankrolled by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. \"They're scary motherf -- to get involved with\" and have a \"horrible record on human rights,\" Mickelson said of the Saudis. But he insisted that the threat of a Saudi tour gave tour pros \"once-in-a-lifetime\" lever-age to force the PGA Tour to make changes, including giving players possession of their own media rights. </p><p>   After major blowback, Mickelson apologized for his \"reckless\" remarks and has since gone underground. He didn't play in the Masters or in last week's PGA Championship, where he was the defending champ, and hasn't ruled out competing in the first Saudi tour event next month. </p><p>   But \"Phil\" is not a hatchet job. Mr. Shipnuck, who has been reporting on golf since 1994, has more than enough stories, insights and details to create a fascinating read without taking sides. </p><p>   The first chapter offers a compendium of Mickelson stories from the mouths of Johnny Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Gary McCord, Jim Nantz and others. We hear how Mickelson inspired the U.S. team at the 2003 President's Cup despite going 0-5 himself, rushed to comfort golfer Ryan Palmer when his wife was diagnosed with cancer (and set her up with great doctors), and drove across town after a tournament practice round to sign autographs for someone he hardly knew. But we also hear how he shamelessly hogged the spotlight at Nick Faldo's 60th birthday party, has bragged to top athletes from other sports that he coulda been a major-league baseball star and seldom passes up the chance to amaze others with everything he knows. </p><p>   In Mr. Shipnuck's rendering, a key component of Mickelson's character is his need for \"juice.\" Juice may explain why he attempts so many daring shots on the golf course. Gambling, though, seems to be his most exhilarating juice source. He hardly ever plays practice rounds without something on the line, has apparently won millions of dollars in fantasy-football leagues, and has been consumed by Las Vegas and sports-book wagering for decades. </p><p>   Mr. Shipnuck reports, startlingly, that Mickelson accumulated more than $40 million in gambling losses between 2010 and 2014. The figure comes from government scrutiny of his finances in connection with the 2017 Dean Foods insider-trading trial of Billy Walters, Mickelson's friend and sometime bookie. (Walters was convicted on 10 counts.) Although Mickelson wasn't indicted, he agreed to return more than $1 million in profits and interest from Dean Foods trades he made on advice from Walters. </p><p>   Even so, readers may be swayed as much by Mickelson's positives as by his negatives. Mr. Shipnuck's reporting leaves little doubt that \"golf's most high-profile family man\" is indeed abidingly devoted to his wife and children. Many of his blunders, such as swiping at a moving golf ball on a green at the 2018 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, are caused by impulsivity rather than bad faith. </p><p>   Essentially, Mickelson remains an enigma. Mr. Shipnuck quotes Jim \"Bones\" Mackay, Mickelson's once loyal, later estranged caddy: \"I spent twenty-five years standing next to the guy and he's still a total mystery to me.\" </p><p>   Mickelson's fraught relationship with Tiger Woods pops up throughout Mr. Shipnuck's narrative, but it gets a fuller treatment in Bob Harig's excellent \"Tiger &amp; Phil: Golf's Most Fascinating Rivalry\" (St. Martin's, 355 pages, $29.99). Mr. Harig, a golf writer who has covered both players since their careers began, concedes that \"rivalry\" may be a stretch. Woods's record (82 wins, 15 majors) clearly outstrips Mickelson's (45 wins, six majors). But during the so-called Tiger Era, nobody gave Woods more of a run for his money than Mickelson. And they definitely got under each other's skin. </p><p>   At the 1998 Nissan Open, after the two played what would be their last practice round together for 20 years, Mickelson left a photocopy of the five $100 bills he had won that day from Woods in Woods's locker, along with a mocking note about how happy the \"Benjis\" would be in their new home. Sitting in the scorer's tent after the last round of the 2002 PGA Championship, Woods yelled \"Yes!\" after watching Rich Beem hole out his final putt to beat him by a stroke. Asked why the unusual response, he replied: \"That's Rich Beem one, Phil Mickelson zero!\" (Mickelson finished tied for 34th.) </p><p>   In recent years, Mr. Harig notes, there have been signs of friendliness, but with both men still in the news, the rivalry may not yet have played itself out. </p><p>   For the record, Rick Reilly is a Phil Mickelson guy, not a Tiger Woods guy. This we learn in his chapter on Mickelson in \"So Help Me Golf: Why We Love the Game\" (Hachette, 258 pages, $29). Mr. Reilly, the longtime Sports Illustrated and ESPN writer, has an infectious voice (2.5 funny things per page, I counted) and loves the game of golf beyond all reason. The book is a hodgepodge of short, quirky chapters that cohere as a quasi-narrative because Mr. Reilly structures them around his relationship with his father -- which wasn't at all pretty. </p><p>   The elder Reilly, according to the younger, was an avid golfer who never failed to come home from the course drunk and mean. The family cowered in fear. In his earliest years, the author despised golf by association but gradually found his salvation through the game. </p><p>   Mr. Reilly draws on his years of writing about major tournaments and PGA stars, but the chapters that pack the most punch focus on unheralded triumphs and everyday players: the young American pro who embraced a man with Down syndrome moments after the man had unintentionally cost him victory at the Visa Open de Argentina; a group of buddies in Colorado who conspired to rig a raffle so that the down-on-his-luck pro at their muni could take home the prize with his pride intact; the blind golfer who heard more to marvel at during his golf rounds than Mr. Reilly ever saw. For Mr. Reilly, golf is many things, but at its best it's a way for people to show and share their love. This book is his thank you. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Newport, the Journal's golf columnist from 2006 to 2015, is at work on a golf-related novel. </p><p></p>",
