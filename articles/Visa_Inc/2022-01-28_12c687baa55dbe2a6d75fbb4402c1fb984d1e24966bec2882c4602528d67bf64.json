The iPhone giant's big beat could be the next catalyst to spark a rally in the tech space,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at&#xa0;Investing.com, in a note to clients.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;After a monster quarter, Apple's non-forecast is good enough for Wall Street</p><p>But elsewhere in the tech realm, stock in Robinhood Markets HOOD tumbled 15% in premarket trading after the trading app closely associated with the “meme stocks” phenomenon swung to a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and reported a drop securities-trading volumes.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;Robinhood is about to not celebrate a very unhappy anniversary</p><p>The Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000, which slipped into correction territory on Thursday, are on pace for their worst months since&#xa0;March 2020, according to some data.</p><p>A volatile month has whipsawed investors, who have juggled worries over the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, a mixed earnings season, the ongoing pandemic fallout and geopolitical worries surrounding a potential Russia invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Questions over the Federal Reserve's plans to tackle inflation have hit interest rate-sensitive tech and growth stocks particularly hard. This week's Fed meeting produced no change, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell didn't rule out a potential rate hike at each meeting this year, and said the central bank needed to be “nimble.”&#xa0;</p><p>Read:Here's what history says about stock-market returns during Fed rate-hike periods</p><p>The Fed's latest revelations have hit gold prices the hardest, with the precious metal GC00 pushing further below the key $1,800 an-ounce mark on Friday.</p><p>“The biggest worry for traders now is how much of an interest rate hike they will see coming in March.
