  "title": "Western Union Suspends Operations in Russia, Belarus; Money-transfer company says it has been working to support Ukrainian customers, including by waiving fees",
  "text": "<p>The company said that considerations included the effects on its employees, partners and customers, but that it ultimately made the decision in light of the continuing impact of Russia's prolonged assault on Ukraine.</p><p>The sanctions recently imposed on Russia and Belarus aren't mentioned in Western Union's Thursday statement. But the company said in its 2021 annual report filed in February that government sanctions related to Russia and Ukraine were affecting its ability to offer services in the region, and that further instability or tension in the region could cause it to change its operating model.</p><p>Western Union also said Thursday that its teams have been working to support its Ukrainian customers for the past weeks, especially those who have been displaced. The company said these moves include making donations to support humanitarian relief efforts and waiving fees for money-transfer services.</p><p>Western Union had strong revenue growth in consumer-to-consumer money-transfer service in Russia in 2021, according to its annual report. The company didn't break out revenue figures for Russia, but said revenue in its consumer-to-consumer transfer business in Europe and Russia totaled about $1.3 billion in 2021, up 3% from 2020.</p><p>The U.S. and its allies have imposed economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia and Belarus in recent weeks, including blacklisting key Russian state-owned banks, such as Sberbank. Some other international money-transfer firms, including Remitly Global Inc., Wise PLC and WorldRemit Group, said last week they suspended service to Russia. The biggest U.S. credit-card networks, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., are no longer handling transactions for financial institutions subject to the Russia sanctions.</p><p>Chris Wack contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p><p>Western Union Suspends Operations in Russia, Belarus</p>",
