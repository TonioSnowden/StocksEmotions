  "title": "No Visa for Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi; He heads a state that routinely endangers U.S. citizens, including former national security adviser John Bolton.",
  "text": "<p>This is unacceptable behavior by the Iranian government. Tehran has directed other assassination plots on American soil, targeted former U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and recently attempted to kill Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad in Brooklyn. After U.S. intelligence warned of a terrorist threat against an Iranian freedom-fighters conference in Albania last month, sponsors were forced to postpone the event.</p><p>White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned Iran in January to stop endangering Americans or face severe consequences. But Iran remains undeterred. It is ominous but consistent with its malign track record that Tehran feels confident it can risk carrying out such attacks.</p><p>In 2018 Iranian diplomat Assadollah Assadi was arrested in Germany for planning to bomb a convention of Iranian dissidents in France, an action that could have killed hundreds, including Americans. Belgium tried and sentenced Mr. Assadi to 20 years in prison but ratified a treaty with Iran to trade him for Belgian aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele, whom Tehran had seized. Releasing Mr. Assadi would be a grave mistake by Belgium, which hasn't indicated when it intends to transfer him to Iran. Doing so would heighten the incentive for hostage-taking and the perception that Iranian terrorists can act with impunity on European soil.</p><p>If President Biden takes strong action against Mr. Raisi, he will win support from both parties in Congress and give strength to Belgium and other European allies that need an infusion of resolve.</p><p>An Iranian attack against Americans isn't merely state sponsorship of terrorism. It should be treated as an act of war. Tehran should be made to understand that it is risking a decisive U.S. military response.</p><p>The first step—and the least the U.S. should do—is exercise its sovereign right to deny an entry visa to Mr. Raisi. Regime apologists will claim that Washington is obligated to issue visas to heads of government who are invited to speak at the U.N. But Mr. Raisi's attempts to assassinate Americans on U.S. soil render such obligations void. Mr. Biden's duty, first and foremost, is to protect the American people. Congress has acknowledged this duty, granting the president authority to deny a visa to anyone for \"security, terrorism, and foreign policy\" reasons.</p><p>Mr. Raisi is unlike any Iranian president to seek to visit Manhattan since Ali Khamenei became supreme leader in 1989. Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani were smiling frontmen for a brutal regime trying to deceive the international community. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was a propagandist for the regime. But Mr. Raisi is a hangman who oversaw the star-chamber trials and executions of several thousand political opponents of the regime.</p><p>Mr. Raisi has been subjected to sanctions by the U.S. government, which cited his complicity in serious human-rights abuses, and has been a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council since 2019—during which time its security agents have targeted American citizens like Ms. Alinejad and Mr. Bolton.</p><p>Washington has refused to issue visas to foreign officials in the past. The Reagan administration declined to grant one to Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat in 1988 based on his record of terrorism. The Obama administration stopped Iran's attempt to send Hamid Aboutalebi to the U.N. in 2014, because of his involvement in the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Biden administration launched a new visa-restriction program last year for those, acting on behalf of a foreign government, who are believed to be engaged in extrajudicial counterdissident activities.</p><p>Mr. Raisi meets all these standards. No treaty or U.N. host country agreement requires the U.S. to admit Mr. Raisi. The president of a country actively seeking to assassinate American citizens on U.S. soil shouldn't be allowed to enter the U.S. at all.</p><p>Mr. Lieberman was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2000 and a U.S. senator from Connecticut, 1989-2013. Mr. Wallace served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for management and reform during the administration of President George W. Bush. They are, respectively, chairman and CEO of United Against Nuclear Iran.</p><p>No Visa for Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi</p>",
