Central banks do. </p> <p>According to the Bank for International Settlements, nine out of 10 are exploring central bank digital currencies with more than half developing them or running concrete experiments. </p> <p>Brazil's instant payment system, Pix, launched by its central bank in November 2020, now processes around 2.5bn transactions a day and is rapidly eating into the volume of the credit card networks. </p> <p>These innovations will be the real game changers in the payments industry.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Hakim</strong><br><em>Belmont, MA, US</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Only central banks can take on card companies' FT.com 25 November.
