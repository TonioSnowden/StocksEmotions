  "title": "U.S. News: Panel Urges Banklike Rules for Stablecoins",
  "text": "<p>In the absence of congressional action, the panel recommended that a broader group of regulators charged with detecting risks to the financial system -- the Financial Stability Oversight Council -- consider whether to designate certain stablecoin activities as systemically important. Such a process could ultimately lead to the Federal Reserve writing more-stringent risk-management standards for stablecoin companies.</p><p>\"The rapid growth of stablecoins increases the urgency of this work,\" the regulators said in Monday's report, issued by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes the heads of several regulatory agencies. \"Failure to act risks growth of payment stablecoins without adequate protection for users, the financial system and the broader economy.\"</p><p>Stablecoins are issued by companies such as Tether Ltd. and Circle Internet Financial Inc. and are designed to combine the ability to trade quickly online like bitcoin with the stability of national currencies like the dollar. But the Treasury-led panel said stablecoins could fuel instability if users come to doubt the value of their underlying assets that keep their prices stable, among other risks.</p><p>Stablecoins are used mainly by investors to buy and sell crypto assets on exchanges such as Coinbase, which process trades 24 hours a day. They are also used as collateral for derivatives -- contracts to buy or sell an underlying security at a specified price.</p><p>That could quickly change over the coming years. Administration officials say the coins may be used more broadly as a swift means of payment for consumers and businesses, putting them into competition with banks and card networks such as Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. Diem Association, a group backed by Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook Inc., and 25 other members, is seeking to launch a stablecoin that will leverage the social network's three billion users. Diem is partnering with a bank regulated by the Fed on the project.</p><p>The administration said it would prefer that Congress create a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, but signaled it is prepared to move forward through FSOC if Congress doesn't act.</p><p>The regulatory route has drawbacks, officials have said. The FSOC process for targeting firms for stricter regulation is historically cumbersome and would have to be applied in a novel manner in this case -- to cover stablecoin-related payment activities, instead of targeting a specific set of nonbank financial firms. It could also face legal challenges.</p><p>\"Legislation could be helpful, but the downside of course is how long that will take to get,\" said Timothy Massad, who was a member of the working group when he led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration. \"That's why FSOC is another way to go that provides a means to create a pretty comprehensive framework.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
