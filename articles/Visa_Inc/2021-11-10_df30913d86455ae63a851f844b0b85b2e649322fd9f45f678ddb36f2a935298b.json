  "text": "<p>Business leaders are increasingly interested in the skills that marketing chiefs can bring to corporate boards. But marketers will need to prove themselves to land a seat at the table, executives at The Wall Street Journal's CMO Network Summit said on Tuesday.</p><p>Marketers are still fairly sparse on boards of directors, said Ayana Parsons, senior partner for executive search and leadership advisory at management consulting firm Korn Ferry. But their ability to build brands, understand customers' needs and get digital operations rolling in the teeth of societal crosscurrents can offer deep value to a board, she added.</p><p>\"I firmly believe that there's never been a better time for CMOs to be positioned for board roles,\" she said.</p><p>Those interested are advised to take part in board-readiness programs, and make more appearances in front of their own boards. But they should also spend as much time networking with directors to understand how recruitment works and what it takes, Ms. Parsons said.</p><p>\"We often say finding a job is a full-time job in and of itself,\" she said. \"A board seat is no different. It requires time and networking.\"</p><p>Chief marketers also need to show they are respected within their own industry, particularly by other CMOs, said Lynne Biggar, executive vice president and global chief marketing officer of Visa Inc.</p><p>\"That doesn't mean winning loads of awards,\" she said. \"It means, are you showing up as a person that's trying to make the practice better? Are you contributing to industry panels and trade groups? Do you have that legacy of service, can you think broader than your current role?\"</p><p>The deliberate pace of the recruitment process is indicative of the commitment expected of board members once they join; some companies are looking for minimum terms of 10 years.</p><p>So marketers should be sure the board they join is right for them, said Jerri DeVard, the founder of the Black Executive CMO Alliance, the former chief customer officer at Office Depot Inc., and a board member at Under Armour Inc.</p><p>The instinct is to jump at the first opportunity, but executives need to be selective before making such a commitment, she said.</p><p>\"Someone may call you, but the question is, would you call them?\" Ms. DeVard said. \"You really have to think about this as a marriage.\"</p><p>Shooting for the top</p><p>Chief marketing officers are also well-positioned to take on the top job of chief executive—provided they understand the marketing role is to demonstrably make the company more money.</p><p>That's according to Kristin Lemkau, who in 2019 was promoted from CMO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management.</p><p>Not many marketers make the leap to CEO, but Ms. Lemkau said she hopes more will—by simply doing their jobs well.</p><p>As CMO, Ms. Lemkau said, she increased the proportion of the company's marketing spend that was directly measurable by business outcomes, and increased the return on investment of that measurable budget during her tenure.</p><p>Ms. Lemkau once considered the CMO job to be her career ceiling, she said. But encouragement from her boss, the bank's retiring co-president and chief operating officer, Gordon Smith, pushed her to go for a CEO role.</p><p>Even CMOs who don't have such a mentor should be determined in asking for the promotion, she said, and if they're told they don't have enough experience, ask how they can get it.</p><p>\"Don't accept that CMO is your ceiling,\" Ms. Lemkau said. \"Raise your hand, ask for the next thing, and say, 'Why not me?'\"</p><p>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</p><p>How CMOs Can Get on Boards, or Even Become CEOs</p>",
