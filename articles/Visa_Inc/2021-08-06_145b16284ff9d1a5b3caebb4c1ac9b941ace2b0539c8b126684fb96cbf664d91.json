  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>We all know vaccines are big business for pharma companies. Investors may have overlooked the money being made by those doing the jabbing. The latest to join the billionaires list is a doctor in Singapore that has benefited from the country's testing and vaccination drive.</p> <p>Loo Choon Yong, executive chair of Raffles Medical Group, is now worth $1.1bn, according to Bloomberg data. Net income at the healthcare provider more than doubled in the first half from booming business at the group's vaccination centres and testing sites. Shares have gained 50 per cent this year</p> <p>With air travel slowly picking up, air border screening and pre-travel testing have provided a further boost to revenues.</p> <p>Companies that make test kits have also scored a windfall. Roche registered this in first-half sales growth. The Swiss healthcare group has also emerged as an important producer of Covid-19 medicines. Health regulators have approved Roche's arthritis drug Actemra for emergency use on hospitalised Covid patients.</p> <p>The billions being injected into big pharma amid the pandemic have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdbfae59-175e-44cb-8de8-7f270caef71f\">piqued the interest of SoftBank</a>. Northstar, the asset management arm of the Japanese tech investor, desperately needs to repair its reputation following a $5.6bn loss on derivatives. Lex sees its $5bn investment in Roche as less far-fetched than many others embraced by SoftBank.</p> <p>Both Roche and SoftBank's boss Masayoshi Son have a taste for big data and disruption. The pharma industry could be revolutionised by the convergence of medical knowledge, technology and data science. Roche's enthusiasm for data-driven drug discovery should feed a promising pipeline</p> <p>Other pharma groups, notably French vaccine company Sanofi, have struggled to capitalise on the pandemic. Having lost out in the race to develop a Covid vaccine, Sanofi is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76876e0a-4f49-4f2a-bb25-47010eaeb0b8\">investing heavily</a> in the messenger RNA technology used by its more agile challengers Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer. Sanofi is buying US mRNA specialist Translate Bio for $3.2bn. </p> <p>Lex thinks the all-cash deal makes sense. It will defend Sanofi's vaccine business, which relies on traditional manufacturing techniques, which are complex and slow, without straining finances.</p> <p>For those yet to be jabbed, social distancing remains the safest alternative. Travel remains risky. A recovery in travel will be a long haul for British Airways' owner International Airlines Group, with passenger demand not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until at least 2023. A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8dc0d7b9-7454-4211-8974-441a1b9798fe\">more encouraging view</a> of IAG's prospects will emerge once the Covid fog clears.</p> <p>Until then, that means fewer people surfing the waves at holiday beaches and more surfing online property sites and dating apps. Shares of Rightmove, the UK online property portal, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31de65b4-9aca-4fba-81c1-08fd49da3525\">hit a fresh record</a> this week as home buyers and sellers flocked to the site. Visits hit 1.4bn in the first half, boosting revenues to a record £150m.</p> <p>Meanwhile, online daters who turned to virtual connections while clubs and bars were shut have stuck with apps even as restrictions ease. Sales at dating app group Match rose 27 per cent to $708m in the second quarter as it added 15m paying users. But that success in the dating space had Lex questioning why Match seems so keen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/931aba16-1cc6-4b06-ba1d-5d8a48e6e67f\">focus on unrelated areas</a> — one of them, a $1.7bn acquisition of South Korea's social networking app Hyperconnect, its largest to date.</p> <p>Record savings and low interest rates have spurred the greatest wealth creation of the modern era. That has boosted wealth balances as well as home prices. At HSBC, balances have surged to $1.7tn, leading an earnings recovery. But holding on to that rebound will depend on keeping down operating expenses, which are rising due to higher employee payouts. HSBC is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/679a7074-e5dd-487d-afd8-7371cb5a55bf\">competing with rivals</a> to build its wealth management team in China.</p> <p>More wealth also means more shopping. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f87e7822-0924-4e57-b573-251d43af351a\">Payment card companies</a> are benefiting from both reduced credit losses and the bounceback in consumer spending. The number of transactions at payment processing group Visa rose 39 per cent in the latest quarter, with business back to pre-pandemic levels. Lex sees Synchrony, Capital One and Discover as better bets than richly valued peer Amex for investors looking to benefit from rising borrowing balances among Americans.</p> <p>The tech sector, also flush with cash, wants a piece of the pie. Square, the fintech start-up of US entrepreneur Jack Dorsey, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a09dd665-1b76-478c-a50d-e40340b29b7b\">wresting payments market share</a> from traditional banks, money agents and point-of-sale specialists. Its shares have nearly tripled in the past two years, giving it a steep valuation that would make little sense for a mature business — its price to estimated 2021 earnings is 150 times. But belief among investors that it has a fighting chance to gain more market share is giving Square valuable equity to pursue that vision.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend, </p> <p><strong>June Yoon</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: June Yoon 2021 'Best of Lex: vaccine billionaires, online dating and shopping' FT.com 6 August.
