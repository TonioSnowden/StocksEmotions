They accused the US president of ceding taxing rights to other countries and failing to solve a long-running battle over digital taxes.&#xa0;Pat Toomey, the Republican senator from Pennsylvania, called the global minimum tax “crazy”.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>Biden administration</strong> has taken the first step towards<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc0c2f74-8ce5-4d85-bcf7-4b56edd13ad2\"> relaxing coronavirus-related international travel bans</a>, setting up working groups to advise on how to loosen restrictions on arrivals from the <strong>UK, EU, Mexico</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>An outbreak in southern <strong>China</strong> is <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/b43cef86-085b-416d-99b8-8c7c054d0f41\">curbing activity</a> at some of the world's largest ports, stoking fears of further disruption to international trade.</p></li>  <li><p>Developing countries face the risk of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/537be9f5-c968-48d9-b48c-58683da0947c\">renewed economic downturn</a> if vaccine supplies fail to materialise and global inflation rises, the <strong>World Bank</strong> warned.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>India's</strong> vaccination campaign has been plagued by gender disparity: men make up <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/women-falling-behind-indias-covid-19-vaccination-drive-2021-06-08/\">54 per cent</a> of those who have received jabs.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Best Buy</strong> is launching a sweepstake to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93398d92-a85e-4578-91bf-a0663876c686\">incentivise employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine</a>.

The last time Europe's banks tried to build a payments group capable of taking on the US giants that dominate the sector, they failed. But could this change with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61295d18-c77c-4c50-83a2-15e9ff0c4f4c\">European Payments Initiative</a>?</p> <p><strong>The Fed risks reacting too slowly </strong>The rise in inflation might be both modest and temporary and might not affect inflationary expectations, as the Federal Reserve believes, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f23cf87-0e66-4b6b-bf36-8c73f1bfbd9d\">writes Martin Wolf</a>. But the US central bank has locked itself into responding too slowly, especially given the fiscal expansion.</p> <p><strong>The world forgets Syria at its extreme peril </strong>Much of the world seems to have forgotten the country's savage civil war, 10 years old and still radiating chaos across the Middle East and Europe. The complacency that set in after the defeat of Isis is misplaced. So is the idea that fragile neighbours can be bought off to act as holding pens for 6m Syrian refugees, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/def8eaeb-46fa-4417-81bc-47ba5f4f0275\">writes our editorial board</a>.</p> <p><strong>Nato allies need to speed up AI defence co-operation </strong>As Russia intensifies cyber hostilities and China weaponises artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61c1945c-d153-4d58-b9c5-dffd99a6919e\">joining forces in the field of high-tech warfare</a> will feature high on the list of topics at next week's summit. But the transatlantic alliance will need to move fast if it aims to make up lost ground, writes Helen Warrell.</p> <p><strong>Exporting Chinese surveillance </strong>The use of Chinese technology is one of the backdrops to the G7 summit, where leading democracies will discuss how to respond to Beijing's global reach. To defenders, these surveillance systems offer big efficiency gains. But to some experts, they carry potential <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/76fdac7c-7076-47a4-bcb0-7e75af0aadab\">security and human rights threats</a>.</p> <p><strong>Miners' troubles show need for climate ‘bad banks' </strong>Just as financial institutions turned to bad banks to manage toxic assets in the aftermath of the financial crisis, miners need a way to quarantine theirs, <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/284f063b-cebe-4eff-9445-7c488451bbfb\">writes Helen Thomas</a>. The transition to net zero may require models to isolate “stranded” assets and run them down.</p> <h1>Cartoon of the day </h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d5b9430-750b-44b7-b238-6e2160c3c591\"><em>Cloud glitch brings down thousands of websites</em></a></p><p>Source: Wai Kwen Chan, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg  2021 'FirstFT: Today's top stories' FT.com 9 June.
