  "title": "U.S. News:  Foreign-Investor Visa Program to Be Revived  ----  By Michelle Hackman and Konrad Putzier",
  "text": "<p>   Lawmakers reached a deal to reauthorize a program allowing foreign investors to apply for green cards after investing in U.S. real estate or other projects, after the program lapsed for the first time last year over a push to make its criteria stricter. </p><p>   The EB-5 visa program, which has raised more than $40 billion for U.S. real-estate projects and other enterprises and funded major developments like New York City's Hudson Yards, went out of business last July when a key congressional authorization for the program expired. </p><p>   The deal to renew the program was included in must-pass annual spending legislation that Democratic leaders are hoping to pass by the end of the week. </p><p>   It represents a compromise between two factions that have long fought over the program's structure. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa.) and Pat Leahy (D., Vt.) advocated adding stricter rules to prevent fraud and steer funding to rural areas, while real estate groups and some lawmakers from states such as New York want to make it easier for property developers in big cities to raise EB-5 money. </p><p>   Messrs. Grassley and Leahy fought for their desired changes for nearly a decade, but it took the program's lapse -- and accompanying threats from investor-visa applicants to sue -- for the real-estate industry and its representatives to agree to them. </p><p>   Under the terms of the deal, foreign investors would need to put at least $1,050,000 into an investment project to qualify for a green card, or $800,000 in an area of high unemployment. That represents an increase over the current rules, which require a $500,000 investment in a high-unemployment area. </p><p>   The EB-5 program emerged as a popular source of cheap funding for real-estate developers in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. Because investors get a green card, they are often willing to accept lower interest rates. </p><p></p>",
