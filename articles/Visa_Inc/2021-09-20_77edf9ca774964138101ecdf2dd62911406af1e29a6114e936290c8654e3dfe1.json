  "text": "<p>\"A robust refugee admissions program is critical to U.S. foreign policy interests and national security objectives, and is a reflection of core American values,\" said State Department spokesman Ned Price.</p><p>During the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration evacuated tens of thousands of Afghan civiliansâ€”though only a fraction of them turned out to be applicants to the Special Immigrant Visa program designed for Afghans who worked alongside the U.S. military. A majority of those applicants were left behind.</p><p>So far, the U.S. has brought about 40,000 of those Afghan civilians to the U.S. As a result of the rapid nature of the evacuation, they weren't formally classified as refugees. That has legal consequences for the Afghans: Unlike others who enter via the refugee admissions program, they don't receive months of government benefits and don't automatically qualify for a green card after a year.</p><p>The White House has asked Congress to change the law so the Afghans brought into the country on temporary humanitarian grounds can receive the same benefits as if they were legally refugees. That request has met some resistance among Republican lawmakers.</p><p>That technically also makes it appear as though the Biden administration has admitted the lowest number of refugees in the program's 40-year history, with just 7,637 admitted over the past year from countries around the world.</p><p>Though the cap has been set to 125,000 for the coming fiscal year, the administration told Congress it foresees difficulty in reaching that number because of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. The administration said it would initially fund refugee operations in the U.S. and abroad to take in about 65,000 refugees for the year and will re-evaluate and possibly increase those funding levels over time.</p><p>Mr. Biden raised the cap for the current fiscal year to 62,500 in May after the blowback amid a surge of migrants crossing the southern border illegally. The reversal came less than a month after he signed an executive order saying that he would keep the admissions ceiling at a record low of 15,000 set by the Republican Trump administration, sparking a political backlash from progressives, immigration advocates and religious leaders who had opposed the original Trump ceiling.</p><p>Refugee advocacy organizations have been pushing the Biden administration to raise the cap beyond the president's stated goal, saying it is necessary to meet unprecedented needs around the world beyond Afghanistan. Countries including the U.S. have taken in fewer refugees in recent years, even as the refugee population around the world has swelled to more than 26 million, the highest number since World War II, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.</p><p>Paul O'Brien, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that Mr. Biden should raise the admissions cap higher, to at least 200,000. .</p><p>\"At a time when thousands of Afghans have been forced to flee their home to find safety, and Haitians are seeking safety on the southern border, the very least the United States can do is set a resettlement goal that meets the moment,\" Mr. O'Brien said.</p><p>Some Republicans have previously said the influx of refugees should be curtailed, in part because of the increasing number of asylum requests at the southern border that have the potential to burden the immigration system.</p><p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which also runs a network of child-welfare shelters to house unaccompanied minors, has been overburdened by the surge of migrant children and teenagers crossing the border this year. The agency exhausted its $1.3 billion budget earlier this year and has been dipping into money meant to help resettle refugees as well as an $850 million supplement that was part of the coronavirus-aid legislation.</p><p>For the first time in more than two decades, the administration also said it is preparing to launch a pilot program allowing private organizations like churches or volunteer clubs to sponsor refugees, meaning they would assume primary responsibility for the financial and logistical costs of their resettlement. The administration provided few other details about the program.</p><p>Write to Michelle Hackman at michelle.hackman+1@wsj.com and Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Administration to Raise Refugee Admissions Cap to 125,000</p>",
