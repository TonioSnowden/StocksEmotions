  "title": "World News: U.S. Vows to Cut Visa Delays Amid Crushing Demand",
  "text": "<p>Though visa issuance has mostly rebounded to prepandemic levels, demand for visas is so high that appointments for anyone looking to apply are often booked months or even years out, and the Biden administration has faced mounting anger from business groups, Silicon Valley companies, universities, hospitals and the travel industry over the delays.</p><p>The wait times are worse than anything the State Department has seen before, said Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie Stufft, who briefed reporters Thursday.</p><p>\"Visas are central for people to see their families, study in the United States and work legally here,\" Ms. Stufft said.</p><p>She said the State Department is making a concerted effort to hire more consular staff and expects to fill all open posts by next fall, the end of the government's fiscal year, to open up more appointments for visas and speed up processing.</p><p>The backlog is estimated to have slowed entry to the U.S. for hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.</p><p>The lack of available appointments has affected companies' ability to hire new employees, transfer existing employees from abroad and host meetings with international attendees. In some cases, employees have been able to move to the U.S., but visas remain unavailable for their spouses and children. In other cases, employees in the U.S. have been forced to forgo weddings or funerals at home for fear that they wouldn't be able to find appointments to have their visas stamped to re-enter the country.</p><p>\"It's been really painful for us,\" said Karan Bhatia, vice president of public affairs at Google. \"In a nutshell, when you have employees or partners that are unable to travel to the United States in a timely way, it just becomes really hard to operate a competitive global business.\"</p><p>The average wait time for a tourist visa appointment -- the most commonly sought -- is about seven weeks. But demand varies greatly by location, with some of the longest wait times in countries such as India, Mexico and Brazil where demand is highest, according to data compiled by Todd Moss, a former State Department official who is now a fellow at the Institute for Progress and founder of Visa Limbo, a website that tracks the longest wait times.</p><p>Wait times in Indian cities including Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata all exceed two years, according to Mr. Moss.</p><p>Immigration lawyers and advocates have accused the State Department of being slow to adopt technical innovations to speed up visa processing. Unlike with interviews for refugees and citizenship, where the government has started experimenting with virtual interview formats, all visa interviews must be conducted in person.</p><p>Ms. Stufft said the State Department has found in-person interviews are more efficient, since applicants must come to a consulate anyway to provide fingerprints, and said the department has instead been relying more on interview waivers for some low-risk applicants, such as students or tourists looking to renew their visas. She said nearly half of temporary visas were issued without an interview this year.</p>",
