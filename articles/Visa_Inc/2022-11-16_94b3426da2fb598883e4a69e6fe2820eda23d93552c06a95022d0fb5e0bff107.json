  "title": "Sports:  Djokovic  Will Get Visa  To Australia  ----  By Rhiannon Hoyle",
  "text": "<p>   Adelaide, Australia -- Novak Djokovic will be granted a visa to Australia so that he can compete at the 2023 Australian Open, ending an episode that made the tennis star a lightning rod in a debate about Covid-19 vaccine mandates. </p><p>   Australian Immigration Minister Andrew Giles has agreed to overturn a three-year ban that was imposed when authorities deported the 21-time Grand Slam champion on the eve of the tournament in January, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday. </p><p>   Australia no longer requires travelers to the country to provide evidence of being vaccinated against Covid-19, having progressively rolled back restrictions this year as it shifted toward treating the coronavirus as endemic. The election of the center-left Labor Party in May also meant those government officials who opposed Djokovic's entry no longer hold power. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for Tennis Australia said the governing body for the sport in the country was awaiting official advice on the matter. The 2023 Australian Open is due to take place Jan. 16-29 in Melbourne. </p><p>   Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open champion, wasn't immediately available for comment. The Serb's admission to Australia would make him an immediate favorite to win the tournament and claim his 22nd major title, bringing him level with Rafael Nadal for the all-time men's record. </p><p>   Djokovic was deported from Australia in January after a court upheld a decision by then-Immigration Minister Alex Hawke to cancel his visa. At the time, Australia didn't allow unvaccinated travelers into the country and authorities said Djokovic's visa wasn't covered by an exemption. </p><p>   Djokovic also didn't play in this year's U.S. Open because of certain rules about admitting noncitizens unvaccinated against Covid-19, although he did claim his seventh title at Wimbledon in July. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Joshua Robinson contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
