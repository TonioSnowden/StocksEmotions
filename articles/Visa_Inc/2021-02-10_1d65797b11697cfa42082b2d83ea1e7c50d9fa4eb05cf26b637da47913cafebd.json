  "text": "<p><strong>I want to give away a property and some shares — is there anything I should be worried about that could come up in the </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/ukbudget\"><strong>Budget</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p><strong>Julia Rosenbloom, tax partner at Smith &amp; Williamson</strong>, says giving away assets during your lifetime is a valuable way to pass wealth to loved ones without incurring an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b50996fa-1471-4d05-b3b8-53c92a75da8f\">inheritance tax</a> (IHT) bill. </p> <p>An outright gift of shares, property, money or any other item of value to an individual during your lifetime is known as a potentially exempt transfer (PET). This means that, as long as you survive seven years from the time of gifting an asset, the gift will be exempt from IHT. </p> <p>However, as we head towards the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc5c8b7a-b19a-46a4-8cf9-dfb9cb190456\">Budget on March 3</a> this year, we anticipate PETs might come under attack. There is a risk they could be abolished by the Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and replaced by an immediate lifetime IHT charge upon making a gift.</p> <p>That would mean a tax rate of 10 to 20 per cent where the value of the gift exceeds £30,000, according to a report last year by the All-Party parliamentary group for inheritance and intergenerational fairness. If, therefore, you're already thinking of making a substantial gift of shares or property, I suggest you act <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06830ba4-2a50-4db1-93d0-3f03ce3d5350\">sooner rather than later</a> and that you take advice if those assets are business or agricultural assets. </p> <p>There has also been a lot of speculation about an increase in the rate of capital gains tax (CGT). This would represent a further significant restriction for people passing on their assets, making it generally much more expensive to gift to children or grandchildren. This is because where an individual gifts an asset which is worth more at that time then when it was acquired, the gain can be subject to CGT.</p> <p>Regardless of any possible changes in the Budget, now may be as good a time as any to be making gifts, especially where the Covid-19 pandemic has reduced asset values.</p> <p>This gives you the ability to pass on assets at a lower value and pay any potential CGT on a smaller gain, or possibly no gain at all. </p> <p>Second, if you gift the asset but do not survive seven years, the original gift of the asset becomes taxable, and the value of the gift when you gave it effectively forms part of your estate for calculating any IHT due on death. It therefore does not matter if, at the time of your death, the asset is worth a lot more. This means that if the asset has gone up in value you have saved tax.</p> <p>A final consideration to be mindful of is stamp duty land tax (SDLT). If Sunak ignores calls to extend the SDLT holiday past March 31, those receiving a gift of properties subject to a mortgage might be hit with a bill should the disposal complete after this deadline. </p> <p>As a reminder, there is SDLT on gifted properties subject to a mortgage only when any outstanding mortgage exceeds the threshold. You pay SDLT on the outstanding value of the mortgage.</p> <p>In short, if you are considering gifting to a loved one in 2021, it may be prudent to act now, while you still have time before any potential new tax rules come into effect.</p> <h2>I'm interested in moving to Portugal post-pandemic. Can I regain EU rights? What are my options?</h2> <p><strong>Jason Gillott, co-founder of GVP Life</strong>, which specialises in helping people obtain “golden visas” in Portugal, says you have three options. The D7 Passive Income Visa is the most accessible route. If you can demonstrate that you have a stable, passive income — such as from renting property or investment dividends — in your current country of residence of at least €7,980 a year, then you can live anywhere you want in Portugal without having to buy property locally. </p> <p>The D7 option is popular with retired people, though it also attracts those earning rental income from their properties abroad and taking up work in Portugal.<br></p> <p>The second option is the D2 Entrepreneur Visa, which allows any individual with a credible business idea to live in Portugal. These businesses do not have to be large-scale enterprises, as long as you are bringing valuable skills into Portugal and turn over €7,980 per year.</p> <p>The final option is a “Golden Visa” investment. This is typically for people who wish to remain resident in their current country, as the visa only requires presence in Portugal for an average of one week a year, until permanent residency is obtained in five years. </p> <p>Users of the Golden Visa scheme often choose property (worth at least €500,000) as the required investment, and opt for the popular coastal regions of Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve. However, the government has said these regions will be excluded from the scheme from January 2022, and property investments will have to be made in the country's interior or on Madeira or the Azores, at a minimum of €280,000 per property.</p> <p>Many companies have set up Golden Visa investment funds where the underlying assets are property. These funds require an investment of €350,000 and attract no stamp duty. They typically offer an annual yield; some of the commercial property funds can offer yields of about 6 per cent. You should research the funds carefully.</p> <p>All options qualify for non-habitual residence (NHR) tax status, which enables new residents to avoid taxation on many forms of overseas income. This means that a UK resident, for example, pays no Portuguese tax on UK rental income, dividends and royalties for a 10-year period, and a flat pension tax rate of just 10 per cent as well as a 20 per cent flat taxation rate within Portugal on certain professions.</p> <p>All three options offer automatic Portuguese residency rights, and also to family members, including free state healthcare, work and study rights, as well as freedom to travel within the Schengen area. After five years of residency you can qualify for permanent residency, and also are eligible for a Portuguese passport.</p> <p><em>The opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.
