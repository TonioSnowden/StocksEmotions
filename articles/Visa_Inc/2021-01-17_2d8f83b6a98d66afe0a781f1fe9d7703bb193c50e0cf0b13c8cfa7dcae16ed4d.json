  "text": "<p>“One thing about startups is that you can often acquire them,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a 2012 email to a colleague. That telling message was recently disclosed during a Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization\">antitrust action</a> against Facebook. The agency may seek to have the company Mr Zuckerberg founded unwind its blockbuster acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p> <p>For a while industry titans could snuff out up-and-coming challengers by acquiring them. But Uncle Sam might finally have become wise to that tactic. <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/visa-and-plaid-abandon-merger-after-antitrust-division-s-suit-block\">Visa last week terminated </a>its $4.9bn deal to acquire fintech Plaid. The US Department of Justice sought to block the deal. </p> <p>Edgewell abandoned last year its $1.4bn buyout of shaving start-up Harry's after the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-files-suit-block-edgewell-personal-care-companys-acquisition\">FTC sought to block</a> that deal. The company behind Schick razors is hardly a tech giant, but the same competition concerns applied.</p> <p>Consumers are the winners. Competition should benefit. Trust busters and politicians are reluctant to break up over-dominant companies. Blocking takeovers is a lot easier.</p> <p>The cases regulators have brought so far largely relied on company documents suggesting acquisitions were sought to suffocate a competitor. In the instance of Plaid, the DoJ complaint included a doodle of a partially underwater volcano showing that the debit payment start-up had a series of capabilities that allowed it to take Visa head-on. An executive then said, “I don't want to be IBM to their [Plaid's] Microsoft.”</p> <p>In the case of Edgewell, after the deal was announced, the company's chief executive said on a public earnings call that the company was not about to embark on lower consumer prices, which he referred to as “value destruction”.</p> <p>Harry's and Plaid now have to figure out how to reach long-term profitability on their own. Visa and Edgewell denied their proposed purchases would have had anti-competitive effects. Both decided it was not worth fighting the US government. A taller task now remains: staying ahead of a pack whose nimblest young wolves can no longer be tamed with a takeover.</p> <p><em>Article amended after publication to define Plaid as a debit payment service.</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Visa/Plaid: held in check' FT.com 17 January.
