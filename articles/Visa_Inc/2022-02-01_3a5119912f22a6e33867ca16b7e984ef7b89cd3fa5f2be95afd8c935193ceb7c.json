  "text": "<p>Everything that could have made Meta's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96cfd8e2-4d9f-4d8b-8d5a-a84f80ce5bb6\">digital currency project</a> a success explains why it was doomed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e237df96-7cc1-44e5-a92f-96170d34a9bb\">to fail</a>. Facebook's parent company has more than 2.9bn monthly users, sits on $58bn of cash and marketable securities and has a marketplace primed for transactions that bypass the traditional financial system. Its size is a serious challenge to the status quo. </p> <p>What is strange is that Meta did not foresee this. It hoped that by working with other organisations and seeking regulator approval it would prove this was not a data land grab. But in proposing a new global digital currency disconnected from central banks it posed a potential threat to the US dollar's dominant role in global currency. </p> <p>First announced in 2019 as Libra (now Diem), the project was envisaged as a grand association of companies including Visa and PayPal tasked with building a blockchain and governing a new global digital currency. The coin, backed by a number of fiat currencies and securities, was intended to avoid the volatility that plagues the world's biggest cryptocurrencies. </p> <p>Even so, convincing users to adopt a new way of paying would have been a challenge. Less than a fifth of Americans have dipped their toes into cryptocurrencies. </p> <p>Regulator hostility put a stop to the experiment. Yet for Meta and the crypto community the failure is not a critical blow. The sale of assets to crypto-enthusiast bank Silvergate, at $182mn, is a convenient exit. Proceeds will go to the Diem Association. </p> <p>Silvergate's share price has halved since reaching a high last November. The share portion of the deal is equal to about 4 per cent of the bank's outstanding shares. Silvergate plans to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin, suggesting association members can keep a hand in digital coins. </p> <p>There are two unintended consequences: Meta has encouraged central banks to speed up their own digital currency plans and focused regulator minds — mostly against the notion of non-bank issued stablecoins. Issuers such as Tether can expect more scrutiny into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0035016c-29ad-4e6f-9163-2a17df490aa5\">reserves</a>. </p> <p>The demise does not bode well for Meta's virtual reality metaverse plans. But these are linked to digital advertising, a market it leads. Still, Meta tried to work with the system only to hit a wall. The old move fast and break things model must look appealing. </p><p>Source:  2022 'Meta/Diem: Zuckerberg's crypto was cursed from the start' FT.com 1 February.
