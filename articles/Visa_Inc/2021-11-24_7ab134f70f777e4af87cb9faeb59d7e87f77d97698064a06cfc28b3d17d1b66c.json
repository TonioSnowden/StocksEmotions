Even if Visa relents and extends an olive branch of lower fees to Amazon, it will only go so far to unravel the knot it has itself tied.</p> <p>The hard truth is that cards have reached their expiry date in a world of instant payments and borderless commerce. For years, they have been retrofitted into online checkouts, creating an invisible web of hidden costs and unwieldy payment structures.</p> <p>With the technologies available today, brands and retailers should no longer be held hostage to card networks. New and proven solutions enabled by open banking can move money at a fraction of the cost, more securely using biometrics and more conveniently.</p> <p>Not treating payments as an afterthought could be a watershed moment for ending outdated and monopolistic infrastructures and deliver significant savings that all modern retailers desperately need.</p> <p><strong>Roger De'Ath</strong> <br><em>Head of Ecommerce, TrueLayer<br>London EC1, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Retailers must be free of payment monopolies' FT.com 24 November.
