  "text": "<p>Several department-store chains and specialty retailers last year posted profits that exceeded 2019 levels, as the pandemic helped them break a cycle of overbuilding, overbuying and discounting.</p><p>But with inflation near its highest level in decades, retailers are grappling with how to adjust their operations in case of an economic downturn. As major stock indexes have been in decline for weeks, analysts and investors are trying to gauge the health of consumer spending—the engine of the American economy—and where shoppers are putting their money.</p><p>While Target Corp. expected a sales slowdown from last year and more people shifting spending to services from goods, \"We didn't anticipate the magnitude of that shift,\" Chief Executive Brian Cornell said Wednesday.</p><p>Some analysts revised estimates for retailers' financial performance after Walmart Inc. and Target last week posted weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings. Analysts said consumers are choosing more carefully how they spend their money. There is also a growing divergence between middle- and higher-income consumers, whose spending remains relatively strong, and lower- and fixed-income households under greater pressure from rising prices for grocery, gasoline and other necessities, they said. </p><p>Walmart last week reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings.

Sales from stores open at least a year are projected to increase 13.6%, according to analysts polled by FactSet, compared with the 62.5% growth a year earlier. The department-store chain, whose quarterly report is due Thursday morning, likely benefited from an uptick in shopping for clothing as people return to in-person gatherings and the office and stronger sales of higher-price items, analysts say.</p><p>Government data showed U.S. retail spending grew in April for the fourth straight month. But because those numbers aren't adjusted for inflation, consumers may be getting less for what they are paying.</p><p>Kohl's Corp., another department-store chain, slashed its sales and profit targets last week after the company saw shoppers pull back. Chief Executive Michelle Gass said the company was adapting its business to navigate volatile conditions ahead, including leaning into its portfolio of lower-price, private-label brands.</p><p>\"Their wallets are being squeezed,\" Ms. Gass said about shoppers on a conference call with analysts. \"They're coming into the store, and they're being a bit more mindful of the brands they're buying and what's all going in their basket.\"</p><p>Visa Inc.'s spending momentum index, which looks at credit- and debit-card transactions to gauge consumer health, fell in April to its lowest level since February 2021. The company said consumers had to spend more on necessities such as food and gas, limiting their discretionary purchases.</p><p>Weaker sales of electronics and appliances could hit companies such as Best Buy Co., which had forecast comparable sales—a key performance metric—would decline in the first quarter from a year earlier. The electronics retailer reports earnings on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Dollar General and Dollar Tree Inc., which report earnings on Thursday morning, are expected to detail similar pressures on their profit margins. Same-store sales for Dollar General are expected to decline by 2.8% in the first quarter and Dollar Tree's are expected to grow by 2.3%, according to FactSet.</p><p>An economic downturn could benefit dollar-store chains, bringing more shoppers seeking bargains, analysts said.</p><p>\"That's when you actually need Dollar General more than you had needed them in the last two years,\" said Karen Short, Barclays managing director of equity research.</p><p>Retailers and grocers have said a range of consumers are turning to private-label goods and are less brand-loyal to cope with inflation. Last week, Walmart executives said the company saw shoppers shifting away from general merchandise because of higher food costs, but noted that sales for its store-brand goods were rising.</p><p>Diesel prices have increased more than 55% this year, federal data show, raising the prices of trucking companies that ship products. Retailers haven't been able to pass on the higher costs fast enough to offset the increase, said Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Rupesh Parikh.</p><p>They are also carrying more inventory. Retailers are sitting on goods that took longer-than-expected to hit store shelves and stocked up on goods in a bid to get ahead of further supply-chain constraints. However, the prospects of weakening demand in certain categories have some retailers returning to discounts and there is risk that activity will continue, analysts said.</p><p>Target said last week that higher inventory markdowns, and lower-than-expected sales in categories such as apparel, kitchen appliances and outdoor furniture hurt its quarterly profits. The company reported inventory was up 43% from a year earlier and said it had secured temporary storage capacity to avoid cluttering its stores.</p><p>Sales aren't slowing for all retailers. Costco reported a sales increase for its food categories for April, and analysts consider it one of the most resilient retailers. Still, Costco said weather conditions dented sales of other categories, such as patio furniture.</p><p>Write to Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Macy's, Dollar General and Costco May Offer Clues on Strength of Consumer Spending</p>",
