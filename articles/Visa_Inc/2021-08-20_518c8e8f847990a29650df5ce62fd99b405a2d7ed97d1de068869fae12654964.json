  "title": "Afghan Crowds Fleeing Taliban Face Tear Gas at Kabul Airport; President Biden vows to get Americans and allies out of Afghanistan as thousands push to reach evacuation flights",
  "text": "<p>In a televised address, Mr. Biden said the U.S. had made progress in evacuating U.S. citizens and Afghan allies out of Kabul, but he warned the mission could result in losses.</p><p>He vowed to evacuate any American who wanted to leave the country, and said the U.S. would also work to extract Afghan translators and other allies of the U.S., calling the mission dangerous.</p><p>\"I cannot promise what the final outcome will be or that it will be without risk of loss, but as commander in chief, I can assure you that I will mobilize every resource necessary,\" he said.</p><p>In Kabul on Friday, thousands of Afghans were pushing to get into the airport. U.S. officials, in touch with Taliban leaders on the ground and in Doha, Qatar, have said the Taliban had agreed to permit U.S. citizens through their checkpoints to reach the airport, but Afghans, including holders of U.S. visas, have reportedly been blocked, harassed and beaten by militant fighters.</p><p>The three entry gates to the airport remain blocked with people pushing to get inside. To allow families, including women and children, into the airport, security forces have used tear gas and fired into the air to disperse the crowd, Western officials said.</p><p>It was unclear whether the soldiers who fired into the air were American; Afghan, British and other Western troops are also stationed at the airport. The U.S. military didn't comment on the tear gas and firing but said that it is tasked with securing an outer perimeter at the airport. It has also assumed responsibility for air-traffic control there.</p><p>One Afghan man who has worked for a U.S. contractor and who has an approved Special Immigrant Visa for the U.S. said he arrived at the airport on Thursday and attempted all night to enter. His family carried their children on their shoulders to prevent them from being crushed. However, he failed and gave up Friday morning, returning home exhausted.</p><p>\"We were stuck between the aggression of the Taliban and U.S. forces in the gate,\" said the man. \"I don't know if I will ever be able to get out.\"</p><p>Many people trying to reach flights don't have the required documents. One had only his household electricity bill, the man said.</p><p>The U.S. military paused flights out of Kabul for several hours Friday because of backlogs processing passengers at their destinations and the limited number of consular officials on the ground at the Kabul airport, U.S. officials said.</p><p>\"The limiting factor is not the planes,\" North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference Friday. \"The paradox is that we have more planes than people or passengers. Getting people, especially Afghans, into the airport is the big challenge.\"</p><p>In addition to the thousands of American troops at the airport, including Marines, there are British soldiers and soldiers from Afghan security forces who didn't surrender to the Taliban and who are also providing security in cooperation with international troops. These Afghans are members of CIA-trained units and will also be put on planes as the extraction operation ends, Western officials said.</p><p>Some Afghans, including members of the country's Shiite Hazara minority, complained that the Afghan soldiers have harassed them and turned them away as they seek entry to the airport.</p><p>Amnesty International said that it had documented the killing of nine ethnic Hazara men as the Taliban swept into their province, Ghazni, south of Kabul.</p><p>Heavily armed British forces in bulletproof vehicles have been conducting \"gun runs\" into Kabul to collect British citizens and the Afghans who supported the British mission there to the airport safely, said a British official in Kabul. A senior British official said Friday morning that the government was speeding up evacuations and had flown 963 people from Kabul in the past 24 hours.</p><p>Mr. Biden, when asked whether the U.S. would undertake similar rescue operations, said the administration was \"considering every opportunity and every means\" to get people to the airport, but said the U.S. wouldn't expand its own perimeter beyond the airport.</p><p>British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said that he understood that the Taliban weren't turning people away from the airport.</p><p>\"Where they have done that, I've heard that it's more that they are being officious rather than malicious,\" he said. People called for flights should have confidence that the Taliban would let them through, he said.</p><p>Qatar said its armed forces were evacuating hundreds of Afghan civilians.</p><p>France has sent three transport planes to Kabul that have airlifted around 500 people out of the country. Paris has also deployed special forces in Afghanistan to escort people to the airport. Those operations rely on cooperation with U.S. authorities that control the airport, a French official said. \"It isn't a question of willingness for us, but of feasibility,\" the official said.</p><p>A German civilian was shot in unclear circumstances while traveling to the Kabul airport, German officials said Friday. The man was treated for wounds that weren't life-threatening, and would be evacuated, officials said.</p><p>Getting people through the city of Kabul, past Taliban checkpoints, and inside the gates of the airport has been immensely difficult, German military officials said.</p><p>Germany is sending two small transport helicopters to Kabul to assist in extracting people from within the city to the airport, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told reporters Friday. The helicopters are designed for extraction in tight spaces and are expected to be operational in Kabul on Saturday.</p><p>The deployment of the German military helicopters won't be restricted to extracting German nationals or Afghan civilians, Mrs. Kramp-Karrenbauer said. The helicopters will be armed and fly with support from larger U.S. machines too big to land in the city.</p><p>\"This is not a taxi service,\" German Inspector General Eberhard Zorn told reporters.</p><p>At Taliban checkpoints, fighters are searching for certain individuals from the ousted government, a report from the Norwegian Center for Global Analyses said. The Taliban are going house to house in Kabul, hunting down people associated with the former government of President Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan leader who fled the country on Sunday.</p><p>Before taking Kabul and other major cities, the group assembled a target list of individuals, which has now been augmented.</p><p>\"Taliban are rapidly recruiting new informer networks eager to collaborate with the new regime,\" the report said.</p><p>German broadcaster Deutsche Welle said that Taliban fighters have gone looking for its journalists in their homes. Failing to find one of them, they shot dead one family member and seriously injured another, it said.</p><p>Meanwhile, it emerged that one of the people who died after clinging to a U.S. military plane earlier this week was Zaki Anwari, a teenager who played for Afghanistan's national youth football team, said family friends and footballing organizations. Several people died after losing their grip as the plane took off. Human remains were also found in the landing gear after it touched down in the Gulf, the U.S. military said.</p><p>Ehsanullah Amiri, Bill Boston, James Marson and Ava Sasani contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Saeed Shah at saeed.shah@wsj.com and Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com</p><p>Afghan Crowds Fleeing Taliban Face Tear Gas at Kabul Airport</p>",
