If you're not that organized, ask yourself honestly if you need the item or if you can use it before checking out,” says Bodge. To do so, Kristen Gall, retail expert and president of Rakuten Rewards, recommends looking at your future needs, like back-to-school items or summer vacation attire.</p><p>Also see: How to get Amazon Prime free, or at a major discount, right now </p><p>Come up with a plan“Many of the most popular items on Prime Day sell out quickly, so it's important to start the day with a plan and know which items you hope to buy. In some cases, the sales also start early, so you can get a headstart — just plan in advance and start checking prices so you're able to grab the Prime Day discount as soon as you see it,” says Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet .</p><p>Pay attention to price trackersSara Skirboll, shopping and trends expert at RetailMeNot , suggests paying attention to price trackers like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa. “They're going to monitor deals every day and every week throughout the year to make sure that Prime Day is really your best bet and the best time to spend money,” says Skirboll.</p><p>Look for deals during Prime Day on other sitesOther companies want to compete with Amazon during Prime Day: “Don't forget that Amazon is not the only place to shop on Prime Day. You can shop at hundreds of other retailers and find great deals, in some cases even better. Last year, RetailMeNot found that there were over 350 retailers who participated in offering deals on Prime Day, not on Amazon. So pay attention to places like Macy's, Kohl's and Best Buy who all might be running their own deals,” says Skirboll.</p>",
