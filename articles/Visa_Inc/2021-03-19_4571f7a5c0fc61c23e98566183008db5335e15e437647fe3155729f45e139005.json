  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>The disrupters pulled no punches this week, fielding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62717246-6c3f-41ab-ba40-b8138b10da7c\">heavyweight Stripe</a>. A mooted public offering for the Irish-US payment company could value it at almost $100bn. The whizz-kids showed once again that one of tech's biggest advantages may be its ability to raise cheap funding at sky-high valuations. But the veterans are not lying down. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/391846fa-5857-463f-94e8-f8f20cdb2f09\">Volkswagen regained </a>the title of Germany's most valuable company, unveiling revamped plans to take on Tesla's electric vehicles.</p> <p>Both offer a lens into the dysfunctional mechanism of markets as a means of allocating resources. The founders of publicity-shy Stripe, John and Patrick Collison, would be mad to forgo an opportunity to cash in some of their hard work. Excitement around payment companies means shares in listed groups such as Adyen of the Netherlands are trading at tens of multiples of revenues. Valuations for traditional payments infrastructure, much of which remains trapped within banking conglomerates, scrapes along at record lows. Lex thought Stripe's advantages and the sheer size of its potential market justified the price tag.&#xa0;</p> <p>That same dynamic between the old and the new is playing out in the automobile industry too with a stunning $627bn valuation of Tesla. Expectations that the US electric car maker will dominate the industry in the coming decade were dented this week by Volkswagen. The German carmaker upped its electric vehicle ambitions and investment in batteries — considered the weakest link in Europe's ambitions to secure its place as the world's biggest carmaker. Lex concluded that VW shares, which still trade below US legacy carmaker GM, are too cheap.&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;A second blow for disrupters was delivered by UK regulators against US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a4844d-62ab-4930-8d01-0258df54474d\">ride-hailing company Uber</a>. Uber will have to reclassify its UK drivers as employees, offering them benefits such as pensions and holidays. But legal quirks mean the rules will not apply to Uber's food delivery division. More importantly, the rules will not apply for local tech darling Deliveroo, which plans to list shares in London soon.&#xa0;</p> <p>Swedish fintech <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd8e60bc-e466-4f44-9ca1-2384afdfcc71\">Trustly also announced</a> plans to take advantage of record valuations in its sector. A public offering could value the account-to-account payments specialist at more than €9bn. Lex thought the multiple at 50 times sales looked steep, even if it was in line with larger payments groups. Trustly's technology allows merchants to bypass existing payment chains for lower costs. But operating outside the system dominated by Visa and Mastercard seems unlikely to lead to mass market uptake.</p> <p>UK gaming group Flutter is another company hoping to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4663eb-25bb-4e02-b826-9bdf8f7cc250\">take advantage of market highs</a>, announcing plans to list a stake in its US online betting operation FanDuel. The $29bn valuation for smaller rival DraftKings, which went public via a Spac merger last year, explains why. Achieving a similar multiple for FanDuel could lift Flutter's value by $18bn, Lex concluded.</p> <p>The Spac trend refuses to slow down. Next up is online retail brokerage eToro. Nicknamed “Israel's Robinhood”, eToro offers zero-commission trading as well as cryptocurrency deals to budding day traders. Unlike Robinhood, eToro makes its money the old-fashioned way through spreads rather than selling customer orders flows. Lex thought a valuation of 109 times ebitda was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37ab6294-0e8e-4b89-846d-84822a1e61d9\">inflated by Spac demand</a>. </p> <p>One model proving the test of time is that of France's second-largest bank, Crédit Agricole. The strength of its mutual structure and a diversified model offering everything from savings and investments to insurance are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db6d2507-d5e6-49d5-8c6b-796cc6f5d49e\">rewarding investors with outperformance</a>. The acquisition of Italy's Credito Valtellinese is a sure way to continue that trend. </p> <p>Have a pleasant weekend,</p> <p><strong>Andrew Whiffin</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em> </p> <p>Best of Lex articles</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62717246-6c3f-41ab-ba40-b8138b10da7c\">Stripe: a $95bn valuation is perfectly normal for fintech</a><br>Expect the online payment processing company to focus on new countries and new products</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/391846fa-5857-463f-94e8-f8f20cdb2f09\">Volkswagen: valuation moves into overtaking lane</a><br>Shares have been ramped up by enthusiastic retail punters, as well an institutions</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a4844d-62ab-4930-8d01-0258df54474d\">Uber/worker rights: a day late and a dollar short</a><br>Gig economy companies will end up being bound by more regulation</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd8e60bc-e466-4f44-9ca1-2384afdfcc71\">Trustly: payment fintech bypasses the card issuers</a><br>Swedish group is but a minnow in a sea of payments</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4663eb-25bb-4e02-b826-9bdf8f7cc250\">Flutter/DraftKings: good form dictates a FanDuel float</a><br>Even with the lockdown surge in business, neither of the sports betting sites is profitable</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37ab6294-0e8e-4b89-846d-84822a1e61d9\">EToro: Spac bull rider clings on for $10.4bn valuation</a><br>Online trading platform's success will depend on holding the interest of newly minted day traders</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db6d2507-d5e6-49d5-8c6b-796cc6f5d49e\">Crédit Agricole/Creval: big farmer seeks to sow abroad</a><br>A slow and steady approach is advisable</p><p>Source: Andrew Whiffin 2021 'Best of Lex: old-school pushback' FT.com 19 March.
