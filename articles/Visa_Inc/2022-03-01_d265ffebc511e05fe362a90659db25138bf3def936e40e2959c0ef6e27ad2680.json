  "text": "<p>Within Russia, Sberbank is among the largest card issuers and has a big share of the consumer market. Because it is a sanctioned bank, many Russian cardholders are now cut off from foreign transactions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal transactions stopped going through for Russians who had loaded debit and credit cards issued by those Russian banks that were subject to sanctions, according to Russia's central bank and a person familiar with the matter. International money-transfer firms, including Remitly Global Inc., Wise PLC, and WorldRemit Group, said they suspended service to Russia.</p><p>The restrictions add to complications affecting the financial lives of ordinary Russians. The Russian ruble has plunged by more than one-fifth in the days since Russian forces started attacking Ukraine last week. Russia's central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20%. On Monday, the Kremlin banned Russian residents from sending money to bank accounts abroad.</p><p>The clampdown on money transfers comes as many middle-class Russians—especially those who oppose the country's war in Ukraine—have stepped up efforts to emigrate amid fears of mounting political repression and a financial crisis brought on by Western sanctions.</p><p>\"Everyone I know is trying to get money out at all costs,\" said Anya Levitov, a real-estate broker in New York who is originally from Russia. \"They are trying to get money out and leave before the country closes off completely and becomes the new Iran.\"</p><p>Late on Monday, Mastercard said that it blocked multiple financial institutions from its payments network. \"We will continue to work with regulators in the days ahead to abide fully by our compliance obligations as they evolve,\" the company said.</p><p>Visa said it is \"taking prompt action to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions, and is prepared to comply with additional sanctions that may be implemented.\" A PayPal spokesman said it is actively working to comply with applicable laws and that it expects sanctions may further impact its business.</p><p>Among the debit and credit cards issued in Russia, Visa and Mastercard cards accounted for 74% of payment transactions in the country in 2020, according to trade publication the Nilson Report. But there are ways around the networks for Russians.</p><p>Mir is a competing, Russian payments network that has nearly all of the remainder of the market. Because of it, Russians are able to make purchases with their cards within the country. Although Visa and Mastercard aren't handling transactions involving Sberbank cards, for example, purchases using them can be routed over the Mir network.</p><p>In a call last month with a U.S. Treasury Department office that handles sanctions matters, payments executives said they expect sanctions to push more transactions onto the Mir network, according to people familiar with the matter. Russia created Mir after U.S. card networks in 2014 suspended service with several Russian banks following an earlier round of Ukraine-related U.S. sanctions. The country also created its own infrastructure for clearing and settling payments behind the scenes even for transactions that involved U.S. network cards.</p><p>Payments executives on the Treasury call also said Russia has expanded acceptance of the Chinese payments network China UnionPay, the people said, opening up another network for transactions that bypasses American networks.</p><p>Russian alternatives to Western digital wallets like PayPal are also widely used inside the country. Sberbank and search-engine company Yandex developed the two most popular online payment services in Russia, with PayPal as a distant third, according to a 2019 survey from research firm Mediascope. As of 2020, PayPal exited the domestic Russian market; it recently stopped processing cross-border transactions in the country that involve cards linked to sanctioned banks.</p><p>Cryptocurrency provides another way for ordinary Russians to evade sanctions, especially since digital assets like bitcoin are popular in the country. Russian citizens have more than 12 million wallets to store cryptocurrencies, according to estimates from a Russian government report.</p><p>Crypto transactions were designed to exist outside the reach of the regulated financial system. Big crypto exchanges, which are subject to oversight in many jurisdictions and must comply with sanctions, have resisted calls to block transactions by Russian users in the absence of legal requirements to do so.</p><p>Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com and Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com</p><p>Russian Consumers Cut Off from Many Foreign Purchases</p>",
