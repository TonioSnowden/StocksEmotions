  "text": "<p>WASHINGTONâ€”A top State Department official pledged Thursday that wait times for tourist, student and work visas would shorten significantly in the next year as the department ramps up processing to meet crushing demand for entry to the U.S.</p><p>The State Department has been struggling to keep up with visas since 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic forced the closing of U.S. consulates around the world, bringing the application process for entry into the country temporarily to a halt. Two and a half years later, some consulates are still offering only emergency appointments.</p><p>Though visa issuance has mostly rebounded to prepandemic levels, demand for visas is so high that appointments for anyone looking to apply are often booked months or even years out, and the Biden administration has faced mounting anger from business groups, Silicon Valley companies, universities, hospitals and the travel industry over the delays.</p><p>The wait times are worse than anything the State Department has seen before, said Deputy Assistant Secretary Julie Stufft, who briefed reporters Thursday.</p><p>\"Visas are central for people to see their families, study in the United States and work legally here,\" Ms. Stufft said.</p><p>She said the State Department is making a concerted effort to hire more consular staff and expects to fill all open posts by next fall, the end of the government's fiscal year, to open up more appointments for visas and speed up processing.</p><p>The backlog is estimated to have slowed entry to the U.S. for hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.</p><p>Write to Michelle Hackman at michelle.hackman+1@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Vows to Tackle Visa Delays as Frustrations Mount</p>",
