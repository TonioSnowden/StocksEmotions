  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Money Curbs Block Russian Consumers",
  "text": "<p>Within Russia, Sberbank is among the largest card issuers and has a big share of the consumer market. Because it is under sanctions, many Russian cardholders are cut off from foreign transactions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal transactions stopped going through for Russians who had loaded debit and credit cards issued by those Russian banks that were subject to sanctions, Russia's central bank and a person familiar with the matter said. International money-transfer firms, including Remitly Global Inc., Wise PLC, and WorldRemit Group, said they suspended service to Russia.</p><p>The restrictions add to complications affecting the financial lives of ordinary Russians. The ruble has plunged by more than one-fifth in the days since Russian forces started attacking Ukraine last week. Russia's central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20%. On Monday, the Kremlin banned Russian residents from sending money to bank accounts abroad.</p><p>Many middle-class Russians have stepped up efforts to emigrate amid fears of mounting political repression and a financial crisis brought on by Western sanctions.</p><p>\"Everyone I know is trying to get money out at all costs,\" said Anya Levitov, a real-estate broker in New York who is originally from Russia. \"They are trying to get money out and leave before the country closes off completely and becomes the new Iran.\"</p><p>Foreigners could also have difficulty using their Visa or Mastercard cards in Russia. The banks many merchants in Russia use to process card transactions are currently under sanctions. As a result, U.S. networks won't allow those online or in-person transactions to go through when people with cards issued by U.S. banks, for example, try to buy goods from Russia, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Late Monday, Mastercard said it blocked multiple financial institutions from its payments network. \"We will continue to work with regulators in the days ahead to abide fully by our compliance obligations as they evolve,\" the company said.</p><p>Visa said it is \"taking prompt action to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions, and is prepared to comply with additional sanctions that may be implemented.\" A PayPal spokesman said it is actively working to comply with applicable laws.</p><p>Among the debit and credit cards issued in Russia, Visa and Mastercard cards accounted for 74% of payment transactions in the country in 2020, according to trade publication the Nilson Report.</p>",
