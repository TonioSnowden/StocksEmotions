  "title": "Dee Hock, Who Made Visa a Global Payments Leader, Has Died at Age 93; The executive loathed bureaucracy and tried to create a decentralized organization giving employees freedom to test their own ideas",
  "text": "<p>His bank was one of many licensees of the BankAmericard, a service of Bank of America. He soon discovered that BankAmericard and rival cards were bedeviled by fraud, bad debts and paperwork snarls.</p><p>He emerged as the leader of a committee of executives from banks licensing the BankAmericard. Against considerable odds, he eventually persuaded Bank of America to turn over management of the floundering card service to a new entity called National BankAmericard Inc., owned by the banks that provided the card to their customers. Mr. Hock served as chief executive of that new entity, which evolved into today's Visa Inc., from 1970 until 1984.</p><p>Visa now is a digital-payments mammoth, with 3.9 billion cards in circulation worldwide and a stock market value of more than $440 billion.</p><p>Mr. Hock, who died July 16 at the age of 93, said he made Visa a success by minimizing controls from the head office and letting banks experiment with new ideas. Traditional command-and-control management, he argued in speeches and books, extinguished creativity and wasted vast amounts of time as employees strove to please rule-making bosses rather than focusing on what the organization ought to be doing.</p><p>He envisioned more successful organizations that would give individuals freedom to pursue common goals through trial-and-error, or evolution, rather than confining them to plans, rules and policies set by bosses. He invented an adjective—\"chaordic,\" denoting a harmonious blend of chaos and order—to describe such organizations. They would \"self-organize\" and develop organically, just like the natural world, he said.</p><p>At Visa, he wrote in a 2005 memoir, \"One From Many,\" nearly all of the innovation came from banks scattered around the world rather than from the headquarters. \"Mistakes died quickly without affecting more than a single bank, while successes were swiftly emulated and improved upon as they spread through the system,\" he wrote.</p><p>Visa didn't always live up to his visions. As the organization grew, he had to hire more outsiders to help run it, and they arrived with baggage from past employers. When he found managers enforcing \"ridiculous rules,\" he ordered them to stop—only to realize he was using command-and-control methods in an attempt to prevent command and control.</p><p>He wanted to do without job titles and descriptions but found people craved them. Mr. Hock allowed that he had set a bad example by accepting the titles of president and chief executive when the company was formed.</p><p>Dee Ward Hock was born March 21, 1929, and grew up in North Ogden, Utah. His father was a lineman for an electrical utility, and his mother managed the home. Young Dee grew up surrounded by mountains, streams and canyons, where he loved to roam as a boy. At age 6, he had a rude awakening: \"With school and church,\" he wrote later, \"came crushing confinement and unrelenting boredom.\"</p><p>As a teenager, he had jobs in a canning factory and a slaughterhouse. He excelled on his high school debate team and won a scholarship to Weber College (now Weber State University) in Ogden, where he earned a two-year degree.</p><p>At age 20, he married his high-school sweetheart, Ferol Delors Cragun. He worked at consumer finance companies and lamented the time and energy wasted on \"obeying senseless rules and procedures.\" He also deplored his own \"constant inability to climb the corporate ladder.\" That changed in the mid-1960s when he joined National Bank of Commerce, where the president, Maxwell Carlson, saw leadership potential in him.</p><p>When he started managing the credit-card operation in 1966, the business was in a primitive state. There were no magnetic stripes on payment cards. At the point of sale, merchants put cards into clunky manual imprinters, sometimes called zip-zap machines, to record the card's embossed data on flimsy slips of paper.</p><p>Above certain transaction prices, merchants had to call a bank to determine whether the sale should be authorized. \"Meanwhile, the customer waited angrily or was required to return later,\" Mr. Hock recalled. He helped put Visa on a path toward instant digital payments.</p><p>He needed both patience and a talent for brinkmanship in negotiations to steer a global gaggle of banks into adopting common procedures and using the Visa name instead of such well-established local brands as France's Carte Bleue, Canada's Chargex and Britain's Barclaycard.</p><p>He loathed the term \"credit card.\" That name \"was the stupidest marketing mistake in history,\" he told the New York Times in 1981. Instead, he said, \"'Visa is a device for the exchange of value.\"</p><p>He retired in his mid-50s to become what he called \"a ranch owner, recluse, student and philosopher.\" He and his wife acquired 200 acres of land with views of the Pacific in California's San Mateo County. He wrote aphorisms, collected them in books, and spent his excess energy working the land and planting trees. He built a house with room to store his 5,000 or so books.</p><p>In his mid-60s, he set off on a campaign of public speaking about the potential for spawning chaordic organizations to solve the world's troubles.</p><p>Mr. Hock's survivors include two children, seven grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. His wife, Ferol Hock, died in 2018.</p><p>In one of his books of aphorisms, Mr. Hock acknowledged the limits of his lifelong quest to understand and reform the world: \"Even if you could corner the market on truth, you'd make a scant living selling it.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
