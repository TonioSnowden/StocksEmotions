  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Most journalists hate August unless they are on holiday during it. “There's nothing happening!” they moan.</p> <p>I love August and elect to work through it. I don't write about politics, except through the prism of business. So it pleases me that most of those tiresome politicians have gone quiet.</p> <p>I don't cover general news for a general newspaper. I'm therefore not reduced to writing about some guy who's taught his dog to skateboard.</p> <p>Corporate results, which are sometimes pretty dull, slow to a trickle. M&amp;A deals — the grand opera of corporate life — are still around to provide entertainment. There's usually enough going on to keep Lex busy.</p> <p>The last week has been a fine example of what August is capable of. I have divided my thoughts on selected Lex coverage into sections for ease of reading.</p> <h1>Useful stuff I learned</h1> <p><em><strong>Weight of money is driving the UK M&amp;A surge.</strong></em> The stereotypical August-hating (British) journalist is attributing the large number of inbound bids to the UK's cheapness, with the implication that the latter is somehow unfair. Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39332eaf-e916-4b28-ae3b-14a880cd64fb\">crunched the numbers</a> and concluded that US private equity buyers were not getting any real bargains. About $2tn in available equity capital and far greater sums in readily available debt are more important factors behind the bid scramble.</p> <p>Nor is there anything remarkable about the levels of inbound business. The steady retreat of UK public equity is the striking finding. There are about one-third fewer listed companies than in 2007.</p> <p><em><strong>Step change classification of securities distorts behaviour and pricing.</strong></em> When rating agency Moody's busts a security down from investment grade to junk, the average yield spread to US Treasuries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7c0933a-5d78-4ae1-8061-224ae620b37e\">jumps 85 basis points.</a> Credit investors tend to be either investment-grade types — you imagine them swishing to the country club in fancy limos — or they are junk bond hombres, presumably with tattoos and chopped motorbikes.</p> <p>Issuers at the low end of investment grade work hard to avoid further downgrades. Rating agencies are wary of reclassifying them.</p> <p>To me, that suggests low-end investment-grade bonds may be overvalued and high-end junk may be undervalued. That's worth knowing if you are a long-term investor.</p> <p><em><strong>The world payments industry is really, really big and is exposed to disruption.</strong></em> The Financial Times published our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f11b38b-54d6-451c-ba4b-48843efa329d\">Lex in depth</a> on the subject this week. Cross-border payments are worth about $18tn annually. An industry that has largely belonged to banks, remittance companies and big card networks such as Visa is under attack from fintechs and other independent payments businesses. You can see why: the payments industry has hefty network effects — the more customers you can aggregate, the lower your costs and the higher the barriers to entry become for rivals.</p> <p>But in such land grabs, the capital of also-rans is inevitably wasted, even as the capital of winners is rewarded.</p> <h1>Left-field stuff I learned</h1> <p><em><strong>The asteroid Psyche 16 may contain iron worth $10 quintillion at earth prices, 100,000 times the planet's current GDP.</strong></em> Some readers did not realise Lex used this statistic in a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ede2b1e-2872-4c04-b0ba-0ae6486ea9ee\"> piece on space mining</a> for the purposes of irony — no pun intended. Just to be clear, if you brought this much iron back to earth, supply might somewhat outstrip demand. The price of iron ore could conceivably fall. </p> <p>Lex does not advocate dragging asteroids around the galaxy or investing in space mining, a cool sci-fi idea beyond the scope of current technology</p> <p><em><strong>Kalamazoo is a cheap place to live.</strong></em> The city in Michigan has the lowest cost of living of 265 US urban centres, according to survey data. If you took a job working from home in Kalamazoo for a big tech company, your employer might try to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7f57278-dd6b-43f5-a95f-abc7afc436ff\">pay you less</a> than a co-worker based in San Francisco. Lex pointed out housing costs appear lower, but at the same time employers are saving on office costs. In the end, the market will work it all out.</p> <h1>Colours nailed to the mast this week</h1> <p><em><strong>Businesses should compare their 2021 numbers with 2019 as well as 2020 in results announcements.</strong></em> Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f6f46b9-0c4d-4615-9755-44eeb7d30e36\">research </a>shows companies that are underperforming are using the soft comparatives of the pandemic year to flatter recent financials. Businesses that are doing better are more inclined to give the broader picture.</p> <p><em><strong>The UK government should permit a US takeover of Meggitt.</strong></em> Both Parker Hannifin and TransDigm are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1559a896-cff6-417d-b0ef-467949ac04fa\">chasing </a>the aerospace group. We see nothing special in Meggitt's defence technology. In contrast, Lex thinks that ministers should consider blocking Advent's takeover of Ultra Electronics. The group has important sub-hunting technology. There are national security and broader stakeholder grounds to keep Ultra as a listed UK business.</p> <p><em><strong>Walmart is a good investment.</strong></em> The US group, which sells cheap goods from retail barns, was supposed to collapse under the onslaught of Amazon, tech evangelists once averred. Instead, it is doing decently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15670feb-ee22-4c4e-9821-a39b12f60382\">online</a>.</p> <h1>News that confirmed my assumptions</h1> <p><em><strong>BHP is expected to sell its oil and gas assets to Woodside for about $17bn.</strong></em> Lex foresees a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e8e23c2-3222-47ae-a54a-2defe1f1199a\">vast shake-up</a> in the ownership of energy assets and businesses as decarbonisation accelerates. Quoted multinationals will shed hydrocarbon liabilities to smaller enterprises, creating opportunities for investors specialising in diminishing cash flow plays.</p> <p><em><strong>Goldman Sachs is buying NN Investment Partners for €1.6bn.</strong></em> Despite the bonanza for investment bankers triggered by pandemic trading and financings, diversification into recurring income businesses is still <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ca9bba-75cd-460c-838f-34ecc92a8a4f\">central</a> to the strategy of the Wall Street bank.</p> <h1>News that challenged my assumptions</h1> <p><em><strong>Plus500 is expanding into US futures and options.</strong></em> Lex sees UK spread betting companies as a busted flush vulnerable to hostile regulators. But an incredible surge in financial gambling during lockdown has given them funds for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cf65b4b-8c89-4af1-836e-862d6c5a169e\">diversification</a>.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising, meanwhile, that <em><strong>Adam Crozier is becoming chair of legacy UK telecoms group BT</strong></em><strong>. </strong>He is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2038fd94-b144-4095-8cec-a0a1044dcd4f\">prominent businessman </a>who already chairs Whitbread and Kantar, and will step down from the same role at Asos. Instead, I have been pondering the objections of a colleague to plural chairs for reasons related to diversity rather than time pressures. Her suggestion was that the more chairmanships occupied by one person — in this case a middle-aged, Caucasian male, like me — the fewer are available for candidates of other kinds.</p> <p>I can see her point, though I'm not sure whether it outweighs the value of a plural chair's comparative experience and contacts to would-be employers.</p> <p>At any rate, the last week has given me plenty to think about. I'm secretly hoping that the mythical August lull might materialise next week, so I can catch up with some data projects prompted by recent news. Of course, I'm not going to think much about them over the next couple of days. I suggest you do your best to switch off too.</p> <p>Have a relaxing weekend.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong><br><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2021 'Best of Lex: August lull?
