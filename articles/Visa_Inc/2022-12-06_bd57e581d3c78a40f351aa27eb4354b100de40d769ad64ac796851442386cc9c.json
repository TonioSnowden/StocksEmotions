  "text": "<p>The UK is preparing to lasso the humbled crypto bull, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/481d45d8-943e-484b-84ca-3b11f02c0ee4\">a sweeping new regulatory regime</a>. </p> <p>Stablecoins, typically pegged at one dollar, deserve particular focus. These have often been treated as a safer digital asset. Doubts over that definition have deepened with the collapse of a $9bn deal between <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c414257e-a917-4e2b-a022-572268d77515\">Bob Diamond's Spac and Circle</a>, which operates the second largest stablecoin, USD Coin.</p> <p>Circle has positioned USDC as the transparent option in a $140bn market where questions over the reserves backing the tokens in circulation have been rife. Its public filings reveal a breakdown of its $44bn of holdings in cash and Treasuries.</p> <p>Stablecoins can be more than just an on-ramp to the crypto casino, claims Circle. Donors used USDC to send aid to Venezuelans. Visa and Mastercard have trialled it as a means to settle transactions. In happier times, FTX said it paid a large proportion of its team in USDC.</p> <p>But fintechs such as Wise and Remitly have already slashed the cost of cross-border remittances, without the need for a synthetic dollar. And since stablecoins are primarily used for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/cryptofinance\">cryptocurrency</a> trading, their operators' fortunes depend heavily upon this cowboy market. The value of USDC in circulation has contracted from more than $55bn in June to $43bn today following FTX's collapse.</p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stablecoins\">stablecoins</a> have signally failed to live up to their name. Analysts at JPMorgan found that the four largest coins routinely broke the buck, trading below par 25-40 per cent of the time between April and July 2021. This May, the $65bn juggernaut of Tether lost its $1 peg, briefly falling as low as 95.11 cents after the collapse of TerraUSD, an $18bn stablecoin which relied on algorithms to keep it steady.</p> <p>The upshot is that in any regulated form, stablecoins would have to live up to their name or rebrand under a banner that reflects their risks. The first requirement implies hefty reserves that would raise costs prohibitively. The second simply requires marketing ingenuity. Block bunce? Faux fiat?
