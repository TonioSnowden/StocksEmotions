  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Merchants Back  Bill to Cut Sway  Of 2 Big Cards  ----  By AnnaMaria Andriotis",
  "text": "<p>   More than 1,600 merchants including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. are urging U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation that aims to break the hold that Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. have over the credit-card market. </p><p>   The bill, which Sen. Richard Durbin (D., Ill.) and Sen. Roger Marshall (R., Kan.) introduced in July, would give merchants the right to route many credit-card payments over networks other than Visa and Mastercard. In a letter this week to all members of Congress, the merchants said the proposed legislation would increase competition, leading to a reduction in the fees they pay when they accept credit cards. </p><p>   The merchants said the fees are passed along to consumers in higher prices. </p><p>   \"Swipe fees for credit cards are higher in the United States than anywhere else in the industrialized world -- more than seven times as high as Europe,\" said the merchant group, which includes an assortment of small businesses such as gas stations, restaurants and grocers along with giant chain retailers. \"In 2021 alone, U.S. merchants and consumers paid nearly $138 billion in card fees.\" </p><p>   The networks have said card fees help cover costs for things like innovation and preventing fraud. Credit cards can also encourage consumers to buy more, networks say. </p><p>   Mr. Durbin championed a similar rule for debit cards more than a decade ago. The Durbin amendment, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, requires banks to enable at least two unaffiliated debit networks on each card. </p><p>   \"The last time we saw a letter like this, retailers were lobbying for the Durbin amendment windfall they did not pass on to consumers, despite testifying that they would,\" said Jeff Tassey, chairman of the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card issuers and networks. </p><p>   The bill would direct the Federal Reserve to issue regulations that would require large banks that issue credit cards to enable at least one alternate network that isn't affiliated with Visa or Mastercard. The rule would apply on Visa or Mastercard credit cards that are issued by banks with more than $100 billion in assets. </p><p>   Most U.S. banks that issue credit cards pair up with one of the two major networks, Visa or Mastercard. The network is typically listed on the front or back of the card. When a shopper uses a credit card, the merchant pays a variety of fees, including an interchange fee that is set by the network and collected by the card issuer and a network fee that goes to Visa or Mastercard. </p><p>   The two networks together handled roughly 77% of all general-purpose credit-card spending last year on cards issued in the U.S., according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication. </p><p></p>",
