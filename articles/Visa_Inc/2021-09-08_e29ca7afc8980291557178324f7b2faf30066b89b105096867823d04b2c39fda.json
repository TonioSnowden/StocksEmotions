  "title": "Biden Administration Seeks New Law to Ease Afghan Refugees' Path to Green Cards; White House proposal follows the arrival of tens of thousands of evacuees without permanent immigration status",
  "text": "<p>The requested legal fix, which would allow all Afghan refugees brought to the U.S. to apply for a green card after a year, would provide a solution for the legal quandary the Biden administration created when it began bringing tens of thousands of Afghans to the country without a permanent immigration status.</p><p>The administration has said that only a small share of those entering the U.S. qualified through the Special Immigrant Visa program, intended for Afghan interpreters, drivers, embassy workers and others who directly worked for the American military and U.S. contractors, along with their family members. Those Afghans are considered particularly at risk after the Taliban swept into Kabul in August and regained control of Afghanistan.</p><p>\"We gave people an assurance backed by the U.S. government that we would protect people and their families if they helped us in specific ways,\" said Kristie de Pena, director of immigration policy at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian Washington think tank. \"If we don't follow through with that commitment, we are going to see both short- and long-term national security effects.\"</p><p>While Republicans have been broadly supportive of Afghans who worked for the U.S., the proposal to give green cards to a broad set of the evacuees has prompted fresh criticism from some GOP lawmakers already upset with President Biden's handling of the war's aftermath.</p><p>\"Joe Biden left behind thousands in Afghanistan who already have American citizenship, green cards, or pending visas, but now he wants to award unlimited green cards to people who didn't serve alongside our troops and who may even threaten our safety and health—all while exempting them from the normal refugee screening process,\" said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), a veteran whose office said he's helped hundreds of Afghans evacuate. \"This proposal is just another chapter in Biden's rolling fiasco of an Afghanistan policy.\"</p><p>The State Department acknowledged last week that though the evacuation was intended to give priority to Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants, the majority of them had been left behind in the chaotic and rushed operation.</p><p>Administration officials estimate that as many as 65,000 Afghans will arrive in the U.S. by the end of September, with another 30,000 arriving over the next year, according to people familiar with the matter. An administration official said the majority of the evacuated population aided the U.S. in some capacity, even if they don't qualify for Special Immigrant Visas, or are their family members.</p><p>Without a change in the law, the Afghans entering outside the formal SIV program would need to apply for asylum or another permanent immigration status, such as a green card through a U.S. citizen family member.</p><p>Obtaining a green card requires extensive background checks, submitting fingerprints and other biometric information and receiving a medical checkup. Normally, immigrants are barred from receiving a green card if they have committed a range of crimes, including using illegal drugs, though the Biden administration is proposing to waive some of those disqualifications in individual cases to \"preserve family unity.\"</p><p>Any easing of those requirements, however, could draw protests from Republicans who are already critical of the administration's broader immigration policies.</p><p>\"I was selected to represent the Fifth District of Virginia, not the fifth district of Afghanistan,\" said Rep. Bob Good (R., Va.), whose state accepted more than 2,500 Afghans with SIV status over the past two fiscal years, the third-highest of any state. \"I think we need to have an America-first immigration policy.\" He doesn't support resettling immigrants in Virginia because, \"we have an administration that has shown no interest or willingness to be selective or careful or preventative on who we let into our country to begin with.\"</p><p>Creating a new pathway for Afghans also could place new burdens on an immigration system that is plagued with yearslong backlogs and understaffing. It could also pull resources away from other immigration programs. As part of its funding request, the administration asked for $193 million to hire additional staff at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that issues green cards.</p><p>Already, immigrant-advocacy organizations have been mobilizing to try to connect each of the Afghans temporarily housed on U.S. military bases with a lawyer who could assist them with the immigration process.</p><p>Republicans and some Democrats in Congress have expressed frustration with the administration, saying they can't get answers to specific questions about how many of the Afghans the U.S. is now aiding actually served alongside America during its two-decade war.</p><p>At a press conference last Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas described the evacuated population as \"Special Immigrant Visa holders, individuals who have assisted the United States in Afghanistan, and all other vulnerable Afghans, such as journalists and vulnerable women and girls.\"</p><p>Write to Michelle Hackman at michelle.hackman+1@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Administration Seeks New Law to Ease Afghan Refugees' Path to Green Cards</p>",
