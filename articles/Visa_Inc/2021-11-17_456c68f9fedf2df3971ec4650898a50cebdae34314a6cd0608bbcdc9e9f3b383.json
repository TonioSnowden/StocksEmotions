  "title": "Amazon to Stop Accepting U.K.-Issued Visa Credit Cards; Visa says it is trying to resolve the matter so customers can continue using its cards after the Jan. 19 deadline",
  "text": "<p>The U.K. action continues a yearslong wrangle between businesses and credit card companies over the fees that credit card companies charge to process customer payments. Amazon is among large merchants that have sued Visa and other credit card providers and banks over such fees, which they say are unfairly set and raise prices for consumers. Card networks such as Visa and Mastercard Inc. set the interchange fees that businesses pay to credit-card issuers when consumers use credit cards.</p><p>Visa said it is trying to resolve the situation so that customers could keep using their credit cards after the January deadline without Amazon-imposed restrictions. It said it was disappointed that customer choice was under threat.</p><p>Amazon is offering some affected customers 20 British pounds, equivalent to $26.86, off a purchase to encourage them to update their payment method to another type of credit card or a Visa debit card.</p><p>Amazon has a branded Visa card via JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. giving Amazon Prime members cash back on purchases. The card is one of the most widely used co-branded credit cards in the U.S., according to a July 2021 report by Packaged Facts, beating out airline and hotel-branded credit cards.</p><p>Write to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon to Stop Accepting U.K.-Issued Visa Credit Cards</p>",
