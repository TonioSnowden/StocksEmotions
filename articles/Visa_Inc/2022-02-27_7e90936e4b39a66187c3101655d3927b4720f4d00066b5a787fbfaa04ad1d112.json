  "text": "<p>In setting out her intimate feelings on a highly public platform, Shiffrin found some sympathy, but also hostility. So did Vincent Zhou, the American figure skater, when he posted an emotional videodescribing his devastation that on the eve of his main event at the Olympics he would not be vying for a medal because he was locked in a hotel room after testing positive for Covid.</p><p>It's a mix that has underscored the complicated relationship that professional sports now has with social media. It's an essential part of athletes' lives, and ability to make money. It can also take a direct toll on their health, and with it, their ability to compete at all—and some athletes are starting to wonder if they should turn away from it.</p><p>Professional cyclist Geoff Kabush used an Instagram post in January to pose a simple question: Is it still OK for athletes to just be athletes—rather than social-media influencers chasing followers to earn money?</p><p>\"I hope there is still room for young athletes who have performance goals without follower or subscriber goals,\" Kabush wrote. \"Not everyone is cut out for the online drive and pressure.\"</p><p>His query went viral—so much so that Instagram's internal tools suspected it was automated and blocked his account. Kabush wasn't sure what to do; he considered biking over to Instagram's office at the Meta Platforms Inc. Instead, he tweeted about it. A Meta employee reached out to him and Instagram reinstated his account days later. More than 2,800 people have liked the post.</p><p>For many athletes, social media allows them to make money in addition to competition prize winnings and financial support from teams. They build fanbases on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and other networks by offering a glimpse of their lives. The extra income isn't just nice. For many pursuing Olympic sports, it's a way to afford to train at the intensity they need to succeed.</p><p>Brands hire athletes to wear their logos, showcase their products and help spread marketing messages, said Michael Lynch, the former head of global sponsorships for Visa. He added that companies don't typically require their sponsored athletes to have large followings on social media. \"Does it help? Yes,\" he said.</p><p>The emotional toll can be particularly acute in sports such as figure skating and gymnastics, where the outcome is already subjective and determined by judges, and many of the leading stars are young women in their teens and early 20s.</p><p>\"Sometimes it's just mentally exhausting, and it's too much and it takes a mental toll on you,\" said gymnast Simone Biles in an interview with The Wall Street Journal ahead of last summer's Tokyo Olympics. \"And we don't need that going into a tournament or gymnastics competition as athletes, because we already have so much pressure by ourselves.\"</p><p>Ahead of competitions, Biles said, she looks at Instagram and Snapchat only to check good luck messages from friends and family. She tries to avoid Twitter: \"It can get pretty, like, political in the gymnastics world.\"</p><p>At the same time, when Biles wanted to explain in her own words why she withdrew from the team final and four other individual finals at the Games, she used Instagram's story function. She posted extended comments and video of the scary falls she was sustaining after losing her sense of air awareness.</p><p>Companies are cognizant of the complicated relationships many athletes have with social media. Advertisers at Biles's post-Olympic gymnastics tour included Gabb Wireless, manufacturer of a cellphone that doesn't allow Web or app access. Gabb ran a spot during the intermission featuring a young gymnast explaining that the phone \"helps me stay connected without getting distracted.\"</p><p>Olympic teammate Sunisa Lee flagged her stress over social media during the Games, when she struggled in the uneven bars final a few days after winning the coveted all-around women's gymnastics title following Biles's withdrawal.</p><p>But for Lee, who became the first Olympic all-around champion to go on to college gymnastics, Instagram is core for her financial future. At Auburn University, she has taken advantage of a newly relaxed NCAA stance on athlete endorsements, and she signed with an agency, Smith &amp; Saint, that specializes in social media-based deals.</p><p>Britt St. George, one of the sisters who founded the agency, said Lee's deals allow her to efficiently access lucrative post-Olympic opportunities.</p><p>\"I think for young people these days, social media is just kind of a part of life. Suni is lucky enough to have a really great head on her shoulders and be able to kind of brush off those bad comments. Of course, you know, things get to you. She's human,\" said Ms. St. George.</p><p>Being an athlete wasn't always like this, said Kabush, the cyclist who is in his mid-40s. When he got into the sport at the end of high school, he said he could just ride and train, and then appear at races where he participated in media interviews and photo shoots.</p><p>\"It was such a simple life,\" he said. \"You could focus on just being an athlete.\"</p><p>He joined Twitter in 2009 and Instagram in 2012. At the time, neither platform played a big role in marketing. But over the past five years, many athletic sponsorship contracts have begun including stipulations about how frequently athletes must post to social media, metric targets and new tools that try to evaluate how athletes perform on social media.</p><p>Kabush appreciates aspects of social media. \"I'm a middle-aged guy still making a living in this sport. Social media has given me reach and extended my career,\" he said.</p><p>But he decided to speak out when he became concerned social media was becoming a barrier to entry for some athletes. An off-road cycling race series scheduled for later this year asked athletes whether they would serve as ambassadors during the event as a part of the application to participate in the competition. The application also asked the cyclists to list their social-media usernames.</p><p>Michelle Duffy, associate marketing director for Life Time, the company putting on the race series, said the organizers primarily considered the race results of applicants, but also factored in whether the applicants wanted to do social-media or other promotion when they selected the 60 cyclists for the series.</p><p>Duffy said if the event is successful, it will help some of the contestants broaden their reach on social media and encourage more mainstream brands to sponsor cyclists. \"We have athletes competing at the highest level of sport here, and people don't even know their names,\" she said. \"If we're successful, the athlete with 600 followers, by the end of this series, will be an influencer.\"</p><p>Kabush said he's not sure he would have stayed in the sport if he were entering it now. Cycling historically has attracted more introverted athletes than other sports, he said, since they can ride by themselves if they want.</p><p>\"Social media really rewards extroverts who are comfortable, but not everyone wants to share that much personal info,\" he said. \"I hope there's a space in the athletic part of the sport for those athletes.\"</p><p>Write to Georgia Wells at georgia.wells@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com</p><p>Social Media Has Become Essential for Athletes.
