  "text": "<p>The consequences are real. Would-be travelers are selecting other countries to visit. In 2023 alone, the U.S. is projected to lose 6.6 million potential visitors and $11.6 billion in lost spending as a result of likely international travelers being unable to obtain a visitor visa to travel to the U.S. in a timely manner. With a recession looming, the U.S. can't afford to turn away billions of dollars in visitor spending. The Biden administration must give priority to this issue and get visa wait times down to 21 days.</p><p>Geoff Freeman</p><p>CEO, U.S. Travel Association</p><p>Washington</p><p>Visitor Visa Backlog Is Hurting U.S. Tourism</p>",
