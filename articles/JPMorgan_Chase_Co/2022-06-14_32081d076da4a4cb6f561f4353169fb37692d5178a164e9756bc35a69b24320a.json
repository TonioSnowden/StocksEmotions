  "title": "Derby's Take: Some Banks See a Need for a 75 Basis Point Rate Increase; Jefferies, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan see a strong case for an aggressive rate rise from Fed this week",
  "text": "<p>Friday's report on the consumer-price index rising 8.6 percent in May from a year earlier and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey showing higher long-term inflation expectations are \"game changers\" for the Fed, and signal the central bank needs to pick up the pace of its efforts to bring inflation down, Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska wrote in a note Friday.</p><p>\"As forecasters, we often remind ourselves that the job is to predict what the Fed will do, rather than what they should do,\" they wrote. \"This time, we believe the data create such a strong case for a larger rate increase, that the Fed not only should, but will deliver a 75 basis point hike.\"</p><p>\"The only argument against a 75 basis point hike is that the Fed hates surprising the market and deviating from guidance,\" the Jefferies economists added.</p><p>As hawkish as Fed officials have been over recent weeks in affirming again and again the need for aggressive action and historically large rate rises, none have made the case for interest rate increases above a half percentage point.</p><p>That includes St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard, one of the central bank's most hawkish policy makers, who was ahead of the curve in calling for an aggressive shift in monetary policy to tackle high inflation. He was even willing to flirt with calling for a 75 basis point increase in the spring, but for now he has said the Fed's path of likely 50 basis point increases is a \"good plan.\"</p><p>Barclays economists also tied their call for a 75 basis point rate rise to ugly price pressure data. \"Given the latest information on inflation, we believe that risk-management considerations call for aggressive action to reinforce the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility,\" they told clients.</p><p>A supersize move this week would allow the Fed to slow back to a half percentage point increase in July, they added.</p><p>J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli also cited inflation news as a catalyst for changing his view. Writing to clients Monday, he called an even larger 1 percentage point increase a \"non-trivial risk\" for the FOMC meeting, and said \"after this week we look for two more 50 basis point hikes in July and September before the Committee slows to a 25 basis point hike per-meeting pace until reaching terminal funds at 3.25-3.50% early next year.\"</p><p>The prospect of a larger-than-expected Fed rate rise Wednesday is a source of unease for a number of observers. Wrightson ICAP analysts, for example, wrote in a note over the weekend that while they agree the Fed needs to get more aggressive, a three-quarter percentage point increase would be risky.</p><p>\"A 75-basis-point move would be the largest rate hike in nearly 30 years and could lead to unexpected disruptions,\" Wrightson's forecasters wrote. With that in mind Fed officials, most notably Chairman Jerome Powell in his post FOMC press conference, need to prepare markets for a big move, the forecasters added, noting that \"our early call is for a 75 basis point rate hike in July followed by 50 basis points in September.\"</p><p>Evercore ISI forecasters are also skeptical the Fed will shift to a 75 basis point increase in part because of how that would affect future rate tactics. \"Once the Fed starts moving in 75s it would be hard to stop, and the combination of this and the Fed's outcome-based approach to inflation feels like it could be a recipe for recession,\" the firm's forecasters wrote in a note Monday.</p><p>Fed officials believe their rate rises will curb excessive demand in an otherwise strong economy and that a recession triggered by rate increases isn't inevitable. But Cleveland Fed leader Loretta Mester, who favors 50 basis point increases, on June 2 said \"there will be bumps along the road\" and it is quite possible growth could slow and unemployment could rise.</p><p>If the Fed approves rate rises larger than a half percentage point it would be a seismic shift for the central bank. The last time the Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points was in November 1994, when it was also struggling with problematic levels of inflation.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
