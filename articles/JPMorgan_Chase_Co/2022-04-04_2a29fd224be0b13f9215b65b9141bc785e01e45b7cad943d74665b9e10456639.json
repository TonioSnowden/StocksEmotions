  "text": "<p>Jamie Dimon has warned of “very volatile markets” to come as the US Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, writing in his annual letter to JPMorgan Chase shareholders that the Wall Street banking group was prepared for higher rates. </p> <p>The chief executive told investors he did not envy the Fed for the steps the US central bank would need to take to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94f23e69-33d4-4688-b5b0-c996fa0d77f1\">end its ultra-loose policies</a> but urged it not to “worry about volatile markets unless they affect the actual economy”.</p> <p>“If the Fed gets it just right, we can have years of growth, and inflation will eventually start to recede. In any event, this process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile markets,” Dimon wrote. </p> <p>The letter to JPMorgan investors is one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33c9577-0faf-424d-919e-68bda2052867\">most widely read missives</a> on Wall Street, with Dimon, 66, using it to opine on issues well beyond the bank's business. </p> <p>The Fed last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cd13c43-3387-4af8-9866-2d618c936d2b\">lifted</a> its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018, marking the start of what central bank officials signalled would be a series of increases this year as it sought to combat the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93953231-469e-4a2d-b1c8-897ec679ed67\">highest inflation</a> in four decades. &#xa0;</p> <p>Banks such as JPMorgan stand to benefit from higher rates, which would allow them to earn more from the loans they make. </p> <p>“Our bank is prepared for drastically higher rates and more volatile markets,” Dimon said in the 44-page letter. </p> <p>He added that the war in Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions on Russia “at a minimum, will slow the global economy — and it could easily get worse”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dimon said he was “not worried about our direct exposure to Russia, though we could still lose about $1bn over time”, the bank's first indication of its potential losses from the conflict. JPMorgan reported record net income in 2021 of $48.3bn. </p> <p>Dimon also urged the US government to develop a new Marshall Plan to help mitigate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62d5a4c5-7a5b-40e3-9175-ea162939671f\">Europe's energy dependence</a> on Russia, referring to the US policy enacted after the second world war to provide financial aid to the continent. </p> <p>A crucial part of the plan, Dimon added, would be promoting energy security, increasing investment in clean technologies, government policies to encourage low-carbon technology and setting goals to immediately cut emissions.</p> <p>Dimon also explained an increase in JPMorgan's investment expenses this year by 30 per cent to $15bn, including why the bank would spend billions of dollars on technology and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2031a6f-827e-4e18-b81b-e607eb073988\">expanding into UK consumer banking</a> following criticism of the push.</p> <p>“We believe the digital world gives us an opportunity to build a consumer bank outside the United States that, over time, can become very competitive — an option that does not exist in the physical world,” Dimon wrote. </p> <p>JPMorgan shareholders told Dimon and his leadership team at a meeting in February that the bank was providing insufficient detail about its spending plans, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8415b42-a711-4757-abbd-7827ccae2992\">Financial Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Dimon added that he hoped “a few examples will give you comfort in our decision-making process”.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Jamie Dimon warns of ‘volatile markets' as Fed shifts policy' FT.com 4 April.
