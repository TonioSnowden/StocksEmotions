  "text": "<p>Revenue declined to $2.38 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 93 cents a share on revenue of $2.32 billion. After closing with a 4.4% decline at $38.06, shares were trading for close to $41 in the extended session Wednesday.</p><p>\"I'm proud of our team and community for remaining resilient in the face of a challenging macroeconomic environment,\" Chief Executive Jamie Iannone said in a statement.</p><p>Macroeconomic concerns have weighed on eBay, as pandemic gains for e-commerce companies come back to earth and rising inflation puts a crimp in consumers' budgets. The stock has fallen 42.5% in the past year, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has dropped 19.1%, and that spread has widened in the past three months, with eBay shares falling 21.2% and the S&amp;P declining 5.8%.</p><p>\"Macro headwinds such as record-high [inflation], rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical conflict, and adverse [foreign exchange] have all seemingly worsened since the [previous earnings report], continuing to weigh on discretionary spend levels and broader e-commerce,\" JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote Monday, while reducing his price target on the stock to $43 from $50 and maintaining a neutral rating.</p><p>\"Some may view eBay as defensive/value-oriented given the majority of GMV is preowned (Non-New In-Season), but we generally view most items and the focus categories it has leaned into (i.e. luxury watches, designer handbags, sneakers, &amp; trading cards) as discretionary in nature and believe they could be challenged in a recessionary environment,\" he continued.</p><p>EBay forecast adjusted earnings of $1.03 to $1.09 a share on revenue of $2.42 billion to $2.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Analysts had estimated $1.05 a share on revenue of $2.49 billion for the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.</p><p>EBay stock jumps after earnings beat, in-line holiday forecast</p>",
