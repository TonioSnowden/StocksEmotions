The Colonial Pipeline Company, the pipeline's operator, said on Sunday it had managed to resume operations in some of its smaller lines between terminals and delivery points but that its main lines remained shut. It gave no indication of when full service would resume. </p> <p>The outage forced petrol prices higher on Monday as traders and consumers began to worry about supply shortages.</p> <p>Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at data provider GasBuddy, warned that if the pipeline was not quickly reopened, the impact on prices could become more severe in the coming days.</p> <p>“We're realising the gravity of it is maybe worse than what we'd expected,” said De Haan.</p> <p>The attack is reportedly being linked to a criminal gang known as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-hacking-government-and-politics-technology-business-333e47df702f755f8922274389b7e920\">DarkSide</a>. The pipeline is the country's biggest conduit for refined products, spanning more than 5,500 miles from Pasadena, Texas to Linden, New Jersey and New York Harbor. It serves some of the country's main transport hubs, including Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta.</p> <p><em>For more essential energy news, </em><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5655d099e4b01077e911d60f\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> for our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/energy-source\"><em>Energy Source</em></a><em> newsletter, delivered every Tuesday and Thursday. </em>(FT, AP)</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>As <strong>Latin America</strong> struggles against a deadly third wave of the pandemic, China has shipped more than half of the 143.5m doses of vaccines delivered to the region's 10 most populous nations, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/511d3cee-b388-4eb5-a667-e693349ad564\">according to a Financial Times analysis</a>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>EU</strong> leaders declared at the conclusion of a two-day summit that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92510f77-07ae-4082-8930-c8e9fb58bd1e\">suspending intellectual property rights</a> was not the solution to vaccine supply shortages following last week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7046b35a-7c6a-4ad4-8b9c-cc9a367da865\">surprise move</a> by the Biden administration.</p></li>  <li><p>The decision by<strong> US </strong>banks JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to call back their staff <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">to offices</a> as soon as next month highlights contrasting attitudes in <strong>Europe</strong> where rivals have taken a more cautions and relaxed approach to hybrid working.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>India's</strong> biggest steelmaker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc9e439c-1a3d-473c-8fcd-e7d3b8d89d80\">slashed production</a> because of oxygen shortages&#xa0;in the country, which is suffering from a devastating <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/683914a3-134f-40b6-989b-21e0ba1dc403\">second wave</a> of infections.</p></li>  <li><p>Planning <strong>the post-pandemic office</strong> may contain the central paradox of encouraging people to return while giving them the freedom not to, <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/b0dcaf74-9428-4f64-84f2-41b001e1e311\">writes Andrew Hill</a>.
