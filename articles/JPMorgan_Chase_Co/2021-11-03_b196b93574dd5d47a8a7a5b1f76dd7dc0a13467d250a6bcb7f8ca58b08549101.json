  "text": "<p>Anglo American has picked Duncan Wanblad as its new chief executive, replacing Mark Cutifani who is stepping down after nine years at the top of the FTSE 100 mining group. </p> <p>The appointment of 54-year-old Wanblad, who has spent his whole career at the company and is currently head of strategy, is the first time a South African has run the company since Tony Trahar stepped down in 2007. </p> <p>Anglo, the owner of diamond company De Beers, was founded in South Africa more than 100 years ago by Ernest Oppenheimer on the back of the nation's giant gold mines. About <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b861aa8-5979-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc\">a quarter of its capital</a> is still tied up in the country where it employs 45,000 people mining iron ore, platinum and diamonds.</p> <p>The company's chair, Stuart Chambers, said it would be “distinctly advantageous” to have a South African in charge, although Wanblad, a mining engineer by training, was the “standout candidate” to lead the company “regardless of his nationality”.</p> <p>“He's spent more than half his career in and around southern Africa,” Chambers said on a call with journalists. “It's enormously helpful.”</p> <p>Wanblad has had several roles at Anglo since joining the company in 1990, including the head of miner's copper division. His appointment had been expected by company insiders and investors. </p> <p>Most thought it would follow the completion of a big copper project in Peru next year, a timeline that has been broadly followed, with Wanblad due to take the helm after Anglo's annual shareholder meeting in April.</p> <p>Cutifani, who has become<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c488e60-3320-11ea-9703-eea0cae3f0de\"> synonymous with the company</a>, will be a tough act to follow. Under the avuncular Australian's leadership, Anglo has been transformed from the sector's laggard into a miner that arguably has better growth potential than rivals Glencore, Rio Tinto and BHP.</p> <p>That is a far cry from the situation that Cutifani faced, the first mining engineer to run the company, when he joined in 2013 from gold miner AngloGold Ashanti. </p> <p>Anglo's share price had slumped, relations with investors were at rock bottom and the company had written off billions of dollars on bad deals, including Minas Rio, a large iron ore mine in Brazil that was over budget and far behind schedule. Myriad operational problems also needed fixing.</p> <p>Today Anglo is the darling of analysts and investors and has led the sector in rolling out technology to reduce the carbon footprint and intensity of mining. Its shares have gained 66 per cent since he took over as commodity prices have picked up and its operational performance has improved sharply. The company is now worth $47bn.</p> <p>“We see Wanblad's appointment as a strong choice, paving the way for an orderly transition,” said Danielle Chigumira, analyst at Bernstein Research. </p> <p>A Watford Football Club supporter and classic car enthusiast who is a member of the Goodwood Road Racing Club, Wanblad is married with two children. He came to the UK in 2008 when he was appointed head of Anglo's copper business and holds a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.</p> <p>As head of Anglo's copper business, Wanblad drove the development of the Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which is due to begin production next year. He also masterminded the acquisition of Sirius Minerals, a deal that will take Anglo back into the fertiliser market, and its exit from thermal coal.</p> <p>One of his challenges will be to deliver on his predecessor's road map to make Anglo carbon neutral by 2040, including an “ambition” to reduce its so-called Scope 3 emissions, released when customers use its products, by 50 per cent.</p> <p>“Climate change and the energy shortage . . . is going to become more urgent and that in of itself will bring a number of challenges,” Wanblad said. </p> <p>Another test will be retaining key members of Anglo's executive team, including its highly rated chief technology officer Tony O'Neill and finance director Stephen Pearce, who was seen as a candidate for the top job.</p> <p>Wanblad, a more reserved character than his predecessor, said he had “really good conversations” with both men in the past 24 hours, while Chambers said they had agreed that “contemporaneous change” would be unhelpful.</p> <p>His appointment rounds off a series of leadership changes at the world's biggest diversified miners with new CEO's in charge at BHP, Rio and Glencore </p> <p>Wanblad will receive annual basic pay of £1.25m plus a bonus of up to 210 per cent of his salary in 2022 if certain performance targets are met. Half of any award will be deferred into shares. In addition, he will be eligible for shares worth up to 300 per cent of his basic salary, vesting after three years, under a long-term incentive plan. </p> <p>Anglo said Cutifani would remain an employee until June 2022 “to support the transition”. </p> <p>Dominic O'Kane, analyst at JPMorgan, said he did not expect any significant strategic shifts under Wanblad.</p> <p>“But we expect to hear more details on the evolution of the existing strategy and Mr Wanblad's priorities at Anglo American's 2021 Investor Day on 10th of December,” he said.</p><p>Source: Neil Hume, Natural Resources Editor 2021 'Anglo American appoints Duncan Wanblad as chief executive' FT.com 3 November.
