  "title": "Goldman Sachs boosts junior pay after burnout complaints",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs has become the last of the big US investment banks to raise salaries for junior staff in response to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">complaints about burnout</a> from new recruits caught in a dealmaking boom during the pandemic.</p> <p>First-year analysts will now earn a base wage of $110,000, rising to $125,000 in their second year, according to people familiar with the decision. Those at the more senior associate rank will receive a boost to $150,000. </p> <p>The figures do not include annual bonuses, which can be multiples of salaries in buoyant years.</p> <p>Goldman declined to comment.</p> <p>The increases mean Goldman will have one of the most generous starting pay packages in the industry, having previously paid junior bankers less than their peers, according to Wall Street Oasis, a website that tracks pay. </p> <p>David Solomon, Goldman's chief executive, said last month the bank would “make sure our salaries are competitive”. </p> <p>“We're performing. And I would tell you to expect to see us pay appropriately during our normal cycle,” Solomon said. </p> <p>So far in 2021, global investment banking fees are up 22 per cent year on year to $84.4bn, according to Refinitiv data. Goldman's share of the total fee pool has risen to 7.5 per cent from 6.6 per cent at the same point in 2020. </p> <p>The deluge of mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings has added to the workload for junior bankers. </p> <p>There had been a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239631a3-c42d-4ce4-9dc5-1e3cc71ca0e9\">fierce internal debate</a> about pay at Goldman. Some top executives have argued that boosting junior salaries, which are fixed and cannot be easily reduced, could set a “dangerous precedent” and attract “mercenaries”, the Financial Times reported last month.</p> <p>But the bank's hand has been forced by its rivals as well as concerns that it could lose its most promising junior staff to private equity or tech groups, which offer comparable pay and often a better work-life balance.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/479737c7-e038-4ca0-9f6e-9754f1258493\">informed new analysts</a> last week that they would earn $100,000 a year, with second-year analysts taking home $105,000 — up from $85,000 and $90,000 respectively.</p> <p>This follows rises ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 a year at JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Citigroup, Bank of America and others, which also now pay about $100,000 to new starters. </p> <p>Credit Suisse and Jefferies have also offered younger staff perks such as a one-off “lifestyle” bonus and a free Peloton exercise bike.</p> <p>“In our discussion with industry participants, we've been hearing over the last couple of quarters about upward pressure on compensation at all levels from senior folks down to the junior ranks,” said Peter Torrente, national sector leader for banking and capital markets at KPMG.</p> <p>The issue of burnout among younger employees became particularly sensitive at Goldman after a group of first-year staff <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">spoke out</a> about the effect of gruelling hours on their mental health.</p> <p>In a widely shared presentation, they claimed to be working 95 hours a week with five hours of sleep a night starting at 3am. In response, Goldman promised to hire more staff to spread the load and ensure junior employees had some of their weekends off, unless they were working on an active deal.</p> <p>The increased pay comes as Wall Street banks are trying to lure staff back to the office. </p> <p>Solomon has enforced a hard line at Goldman against flexible arrangements when offices reopen. He has called working from home “an aberration that we're going to correct as soon as possible”.</p> <p>James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, has been equally stern, telling staff: “If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office.”</p> <p>In contrast, other banks such as Citigroup and UBS have touted their adoption of hybrid practices as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1601e314-6d6d-4014-94df-f2858ee64e8e\">recruiting advantage</a>. </p> <p>Investment banks have historically avoided significant inflation in fixed salaries, which are harder to reduce in quieter periods. Instead, they tend to reward staff with bonuses that can vary dramatically from year to year depending on the performance of individuals and banks overall.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cea7a35-06da-411d-b438-83bbdec3f51e\"><em>Paying juniors more will not cure banker burnout</em></a><em>&#xa0;/</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cea7a35-06da-411d-b438-83bbdec3f51e\"><em>From Hans TW Frankort, Reader in Strategy, Bayes Business School (formerly Cass), London EC1, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Stephen Morris in London, Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong and Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Goldman Sachs boosts junior pay after burnout complaints' FT.com 2 August.
