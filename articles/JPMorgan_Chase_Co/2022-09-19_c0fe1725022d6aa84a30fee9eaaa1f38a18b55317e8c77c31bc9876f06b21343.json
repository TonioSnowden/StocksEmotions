  "title": "Most of Puerto Rico Is Without Power as Hurricane Fiona Ripples Through the Caribbean; More than 1.3 million customers on the island are waiting for electricity to come back, while the Dominican Republic is under a hurricane warning",
  "text": "<p>More than 1.3 million customers remained without power Monday morning and President Biden over the weekend made an emergency declaration for the island. About two-thirds of Puerto Rico was without water Monday morning, according to a government emergency website, citing data from the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority. On its Twitter page, the authority advised those whose water service has been restored to boil it for three minutes before consuming it.</p><p>Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said Monday that more than 2,000 people were in over 100 shelters amid the storm, and that there are 600 members of the National Guard throughout the island.</p><p>\"Puerto Rico has been lashed seriously by Hurricane Fiona,\" Mr. Pierluisi said at a news conference Monday. \"We are going through a difficult moment.\"</p><p>He said the downpours had produced unprecedented flooding in parts of the island, in some cases exceeding what they experienced during Hurricane Maria five years ago. Damage to infrastructure, urban areas and residences has been catastrophic, he said.</p><p>The storm's effects were most severe in the southern and southwestern regions of Puerto Rico, as well as mountain areas and parts of the northern coast, Mr. Pierluisi said. He cautioned that rainfall was expected to continue through at least the end of Tuesday, potentially worsening the situation.</p><p>A temporary bridge that was put in place after Hurricane Maria five years earlier also broke during the storm, according to U.S. House Delegate Roberto Lefranc Fortuño.</p><p>Medical device makers—among Puerto Rico's top employers because of corporate-tax breaks the island has offered—said their manufacturing plants hadn't suffered significant damage.</p><p>Medtronic PLC's four manufacturing plants were operating on generator power and capable of full operations, a spokeswoman said. The company is gathering information about how the storm affected its 7,100 employees and contingent workers, she said.</p><p>Boston Scientific Corp. scaled back some shifts at its facilities in Puerto Rico in light of travel advisories, a spokeswoman said. But its sites remain fully functional and the company expects operations to resume at normal levels once the storm subsides and travel advisories are lifted.</p><p>Device makers experienced disruptions in 2017 when Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico. Some companies scrambled for days to track down missing employees. The storms also exacerbated a shortage of intravenous fluids that were manufactured on the island. </p><p>Afterward, many medical-device companies strengthened their storm contingency plans, securing backup generators and fortifying structures, J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in a research note Monday.</p><p>Fiona is now a Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 100 miles an hour, and moving northwest, the National Hurricane Center said Monday afternoon.</p><p>Turks and Caicos was under a hurricane warning, while the coast of the Dominican Republic from Cabo Caucedo to Puerto Plata was under a hurricane watch.</p><p>Category 2 hurricanes have dangerous winds that can damage roofs, uproot trees and cause power outages. A hurricane is considered a major hurricane when it hits Category 3 or higher. Fiona is projected to become a major hurricane on Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>Fiona could dump more than 30 inches of rainfall on southern Puerto Rico and up to 20 inches on the eastern part of the Dominican Republic, the National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>By Wednesday, the storm is expected to become a major hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center, which is a classification used for hurricanes that range between categories 3 and 5. Fiona was upgraded to hurricane status Sunday after being classified as a tropical storm.</p><p>Puerto Rico, which is east of the Dominican Republic, was without power Sunday even before the hurricane made landfall, according to Luma, the company that provides much of Puerto Rico's power. The company said Monday that it has taken action to start restoring the electrical system.</p><p>Monday's power situation improved slightly from over the weekend, when nearly 1.5 million were without power, according to poweroutage.us.</p><p>Utility workers were having difficulty reaching some areas because of storm damage, Mr. Pierluisi said, and crews were working on opening access to them. Luma started deploying flights over transmission lines to evaluate their condition and begin necessary repairs.</p><p>Mr. Biden's emergency declaration gives authorization for disaster relief efforts to be coordinated by FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with local agencies.</p><p>Hurricane season kicked into high gear this month following a quiet August for the robust ocean storms. August had no Atlantic hurricanes this year, marking only the third time that has happened since 1950 and the first time that has happened since 1997, the National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>Hurricane season for the Atlantic runs from June to November, but most storms take place after August begins.</p><p>—Peter Loftus contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at Arian.Campo-Flores@dowjones.com</p><p>Most of Puerto Rico Is Without Power as Hurricane Fiona Ripples Through the Caribbean</p>",
