  "text": "<p>   Three former BlackRock employees have key positions in the Biden administration, including the firm's former head of sustainable investing. Mr. Fink says he has never raised money for any presidential candidate and has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years. </p><p>   BlackRock published a study in 2019 on how it said climate change and events related to it affect the municipal-bond market and how extreme weather threatens infrastructure. The firm forecast that 58% of U.S. metro areas would suffer gross domestic product losses of at least 1% over the next decades if they didn't prepare for climate risks. </p><p>   With its index funds, BlackRock is locked into investing in all kinds of companies, from coal miners to wind farms. In portfolios run by active managers, the firm has scaled back thermal coal exposure, as it pledged to, and said last year it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling. </p><p>   Addressing a meeting in Venice of leaders from the Group of 20 nations last July, Mr. Fink urged ministers to create more private-public partnerships for renewable-technology investments. </p><p>   One idea he pushed was authorizing the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to shoulder the first losses on sustainable-energy projects, so other investors would feel safe putting in money. It was an echo of how the U.S. in 2008 fenced off the worst Bear Stearns holdings to encourage JPMorgan to take over the firm. </p><p>   In the lead-up to the Glasgow climate summit, Mr. Fink asked other finance CEOs to press government leaders to create incentives for investors to fund alternative-energy sources. He urged other executives to drop calls for carbon taxes, saying their cost would trigger a backlash, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   He also helped steer debates among finance executives on steps needed for the steel, aviation and oil-and-gas sectors to reduce carbon emissions, and on how society should account for the growing pile of assets that would be deemed worthless along the way. </p><p>   \"Society is trying in certain instances to pressure companies to do more, including at times what ought to be the role of government,\" said Evan Greenberg, the CEO of insurance company Chubb Ltd., who has gone fly-fishing with Mr. Fink. </p><p>   He added: \"I believe Larry chose consciously to approach it as an opportunity, rather than something he is expected to do.\" </p><p></p>",
