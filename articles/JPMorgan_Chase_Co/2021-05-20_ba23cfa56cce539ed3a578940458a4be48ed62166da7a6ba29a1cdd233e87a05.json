  "text": "<p>Two years after JPMorgan Chase announced it would no longer finance the private prison industry in the US, the bank's asset management arm has disclosed a position in a private prison bond sold last month.</p> <p>Funds tied to the bank have invested $25m or more in a bond issued by CoreCivic, which runs prisons and detention centres across the US. The funds each bought a piece of a recent <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/872202/000114036121012219/nt10022754x5_424b5.htm#sUO\">$450m bond sold</a> by the company in April. </p> <p>JPMorgan Investment Funds' $9bn global high-yield bond fund took the largest position among the funds, and holds $12.5m in the CoreCivic bond, according to regulatory filings for the end of April compiled by Bloomberg. The asset management arm's $7bn <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/americas/us/en/supplemental/uncertified-quarterly-holdings/UHG-HY.pdf\">high-yield fund</a> also owns $9.5m of the debt, according to a disclosure from JPMorgan Asset Management.</p> <p>Campaigners for reform of the US criminal justice system, which disproportionately incarcerates people of colour, increasingly put the focus on the industry's financial backers, with the result that a host of banks have agreed to cut ties with the operators of private facilities in recent years.</p> <p>In March 2019, bowing to pressure from activists, JPMorgan said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d897c034-3f7a-11e9-9bee-efab61506f44\">no longer provide</a> banking services to private prisons. </p> <p>“We have small holdings in CoreCivic in high-yield portfolios managed against indices, which include CoreCivic as a component,” the bank's asset management unit said. It declined to comment on whether this undermined its position regarding financing for private prisons. </p> <p>JPMorgan is not the only bank to face scrutiny over its dealings with the prison industry. Barclays, which had also committed in 2019 not to lend to private prisons, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/133e1d24-f27b-4c42-b67e-65b65dcc711d\">initially worked</a> on a separate fundraising CoreCivic had hoped to clinch in April that was set to finance two prisons in Alabama. The UK bank ultimately backed out of the deal after criticism. </p> <p>Damon Hininger, CoreCivic's chief executive, said during a call with analysts earlier this month that the company continues to “move forward” on the Alabama deal, and accused opponents of “an extremism that puts political agendas over people”.</p> <p>It is not the first time JPMorgan's funds have invested in the private prison industry. The $450m bond was issued in part to refinance debt coming due in 2022, of which JPMorgan's high-yield bond fund owned $5m.</p> <p>The fund also holds positions in two different bonds from another private prison operator, Geo Group, according to Bloomberg data, with a current market value of about $12m.</p> <p>The high-yield bond fund is bound by JPMorgan guidelines that are meant to ensure environmental, social and governance issues are considered in the investment process.</p> <p>“We consider ESG factors as part of our overall ESG integrated investment process . . . We are actively engaging with CoreCivic management on improving ESG factors and disclosures,” the bank's asset management arm said. </p> <p>Both Geo Group and CoreCivic have worked on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7df9172d-e155-42da-bc05-8299566d0273\">paying down debt</a>, as it has become harder and more expensive for the companies to tap capital markets given investors have shown a reluctance to lend to the private prison industry. Geo Group in February issued $230m in convertible bonds with a 6.5 per cent coupon, even as a number of companies were able to raise billions of such debt-to-equity notes that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47cafafd-2990-4240-9d53-d7fc64d65010\">will not pay any interest</a> at all.</p> <p>“For the last few years, we have received an inquiry into our ability of the company's access to the debt capital markets,” Hininger said earlier this month, in reference to CoreCivic's $450m bond. “We were pleased that our response is an emphatic yes.”</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8e10dbc3-1973-4ed6-987f-227b2a16b28d.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Joe Rennison in London and Aziza Kasumov in New York 2021 'JPMorgan funds invested in CoreCivic debt after vow to stop financing private prisons' FT.com 20 May.
