  "title": "Stocks Perk Up, Cheered By Fed's Powell",
  "text": "<p>Wednesday's advances were broad based, with 10 of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors rising 1% or more. Five rose more than 2%.</p><p>Amid the war in Ukraine and surging oil prices, investors focused on interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, appearing before the House Committee on Financial Services, said he would propose a quarter-percentage-point rate increase at the central bank's meeting in two weeks. That alleviated concerns on Wall Street that the central bank would raise rates by half a percentage point.</p><p>Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.862% from 1.708% Tuesday, the largest one-day yield gain since March 18, 2020. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Stocks have been volatile in recent days as investors have tracked escalations in the war waged by Russia in Ukraine as well as domestic news about the economy and inflation.</p><p>Investors are responding to fast-moving developments on the battlefield, a volley of Western sanctions on Moscow and major companies cutting ties with Russia. By boosting energy prices, the conflict has added to uncertainty regarding the likely path of U.S. interest rates this year.</p><p>Wednesday's gain marked the S&amp;P 500's sixth move of more than 1% -- in either direction -- in the past seven sessions, said Frank Cappelleri, executive director of brokerage Instinet. Those kinds of whipsaw moves reflect a fragile market, he said.</p><p>\"We haven't seen big moves like this in two years,\" he said, referring to the early days of the pandemic.</p><p>Major U.S. indexes have been resilient since the Russian invasion, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% and Nasdaq up 5.5%. However, soaring oil prices threaten to unleash more volatility across markets, and equities are still in an overall downswing dating to last year, Mr. Cappelleri said.</p><p>Moreover, some current market trends -- like oil driving other assets or rising interest rates -- haven't been seen in years or decades, he noted. \"Very few investors have lived through a rising-rates environment,\" said Mr. Cappelleri.</p><p>Rising oil prices pose a headache for central banks already dealing with the fastest inflation rates in decades.</p><p>Energy markets extended their advance. U.S. crude prices surged over $110 a barrel for the first time since 2014 as refiners refused to buy Russian oil, taking a bite out of global energy supplies. U.S. crude settled up 7% at $110.60 a barrel. It has gained 21% over the past three sessions, its biggest three-day percentage gain since May 18, 2020.</p><p>\"The knock-on effects [across markets] are heavily dependent on how high oil prices get,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. \"If oil prices start to head to $120, we're going to start seeing a lot more talk about the economic consequences globally of these sanctions.\"</p><p>The financial sector was the session's top performer, up about 2.6%, erasing about half of its losses from earlier in the week. Berkshire Hathaway rose 2.2% to $323.64, JPMorgan gained 2.1% to $139.28, Bank of America was up 1.6% to $43.16 and Wells Fargo rose 3.8% to $52.22.</p><p>The energy sector rose 2.2%. Energy companies stand to benefit from higher energy prices, even as they work to disentangle themselves from Russia. Exxon Mobil said this week it would halt operations at a multibillion-dollar oil and gas project in Russia and would make no further investments in the country.</p><p>Exxon Mobil rose 1.7% to $80.53, Chevron moved higher 3% to $154.14 and ConocoPhillips added 1.1% to $98.04.</p><p>Shares of Nordstrom jumped 38% to $26.93 after the retailer projected stronger-than-expected earnings this year. Hewlett Packard Enterprise raised its earnings forecast for the year, lifting shares 10% to $16.99.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.9%. In Russia, stocks and derivatives trading was closed for a third day this week. The Russian ruble fell 0.7% against the greenback to trade at 111.25 per U.S. dollar, versus 83 Friday.</p><p>Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.7% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.9%. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
