  "title": "UBS Is Well Prepared for Its American Adventure; U.S. market has tripped up many European banks, but the Swiss wealth manager has a strong set of tools to break with the trend",
  "text": "<p>UBS is one of Europe's best performing banks right now, with a stock-market valuation at around book value to match. Digitizing products is expected to trim costs and increase revenues while it refocuses its European business and pursues growth in Asia, Switzerland and the U.S. A key part of its new American strategy is a push into the mass market.</p><p>The billionaire's bank will offer a lower-cost version of its services to U.S. customers who are affluent rather than richâ€”those with up to about $1 million in investible assets. Personalized wealth services on a digital platform will be supported by bankers remotely. There will also be a fuller range of services for U.S. business customers, such as cash management and lending.</p><p>The plan puts UBS in direct competition with established players like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab and JPMorgan. The domestic scale of the big U.S. players helps make them highly efficient: Morgan Stanley's cost-to-income ratio was 67% last year and JPMorgan's was 57%. UBS is similarly productive in Switzerland and Asia, but its \"Americas\" unit had a cost ratio of 79%. Perhaps for this reason, the U.S. market has proved an expensive folly for many European lenders. Just last year, BNP Paribas and HSBC sold off American operations.</p><p>Still, the U.S. is the world's largest and fastest-growing mature wealth market, making it hard to ignore. And UBS believes it can carve out a profitable niche, based on feedback from its existing two million U.S. workplace-pension customers. It plans to invest up to $250 million over the next couple of years to grow its U.S. operations organically, and it may also consider bolt-on acquisitions. The recent deal to buy automated-investment adviser Wealthfront brings nearly half a million flush, younger customers, along with a scalable platform and strong engineering talent, says UBS's tech-savvy Chief Executive Ralph Hammers. It seems like a viable start.</p><p>This isn't completely uncharted territory for UBS, as it runs a profitable business for the affluent in Switzerland. This kind of banking is light on capital, and UBS also has deferred U.S. tax assets that it expects to fully cover its local earnings through 2028. That provides breathing space for it to hone the model. Its incoming board chairman and chief financial officer also bring deep U.S. market experience. If the U.S. plan works, UBS could then boost profits further by expanding the affluent offer into China and other growth markets.</p><p>UBS's American foray is no sure thing, but the prize is too big to overlook.</p><p>Write to Rochelle Toplensky at rochelle.toplensky@wsj.com</p><p>UBS Is Well Prepared for Its American Adventure</p>",
