  "title": "Biden Climate Law Sparks New Market for Trading Tax Credits; Companies will soon be able to sell and purchase renewable-energy tax breaks, under a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act",
  "text": "<p>The tax-credit sales mark a shift in the U.S. strategy for attracting public and private capital to renewable-energy projects, and they will happen alongside existing climate-finance markets such as carbon offset purchases. The deals won't start in earnest until 2023, but lawyers and financiers are already structuring transactions. They are discussing arrangements in which credits would be sold at discounts from face value, and they are determining how to cushion tax-credit buyers against potential risks.</p><p>\"The conversations are happening. The market making is happening right now,\" said Nicholas Knapp, senior managing director at CohnReznick Capital in New York.</p><p>Within a year or two, it could be easy for a corporation with no direct renewable-energy investment—a profitable retailer, pharmaceutical maker or high-tech company—to purchase tax credits. Because of the expected discounts, companies could earn an instant profit, paying $90 or $95 for a $100 coupon off their income-tax liability.</p><p>These transferable credits, however, expose a potential dilemma for Democrats. The party aimed to raise corporate tax bills and prevent large, profitable companies from paying too little. But the tax-credit transfers open a new avenue for many of those same companies to pay less.</p><p>\"They can basically purchase the tax credits, advance their ESG goals and get certain economics from the credits without taking any construction or operational risk of the project,\" said Hagai Zaifman, a partner at Sidley Austin LLP in New York who helps structure renewable-energy deals.</p><p>These transferable tax credits break with policy makers' longstanding reluctance to create anything like a liquid market in tax breaks. The program contains echoes of a 1981 lawthat effectively let companies sell investment tax breaks—a feature that Congress repealed the following year amid concerns it went too far.</p><p>Lawmakers designed transferable climate credits to deal with a problem inherent in the generous subsidies Congress is providing for wind and solar energy as well as carbon sequestration, nuclear power, certain advanced manufacturing and other technologies.</p><p>Companies in those industries typically don't have enough profit and thus tax liability to use all of the tax credits they generate, so tax credits alone don't work well as an incentive.</p><p>Initially, many Democrats and renewable-energy advocates wanted a different approach called direct pay, where companies generating tax credits would get checks from the government after they zeroed out their income-tax liability. But Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) blocked that idea and Democrats pivoted. They relented on objections to transferring credits and added some safeguards, said a Senate Democratic aide.</p><p>The final version of the law limits direct pay to publicly owned power companies and other tax-exempt entities. Direct pay is available temporarily and more broadly for some tax credits, including those for hydrogen and carbon capture.</p><p>For everyone else, there is transferability. The tax-credit transfers will happen alongside a pre-existing $20 billion annual tax-equity market dominated by large banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. Those banks form partnerships with energy companies, then use the tax credits and depreciation deductions to lower their tax bills, and before last month's law, such investments were the prime way to get tax credits from non-taxpayers to taxpayers.</p><p>Those deals can be complicated, however, and in recent years, market participants say, too many projects were chasing too little available capital.</p><p>The new transferability of credits provides \"a bit of a relief valve on that constraint,\" said Ty Daul, CEO of Primergy Solar, which builds solar-energy projects. \"It's not perfect, and it's going to take a year or two to see how these structures evolve.\"</p><p>The law includes several features designed to spark the credit-trading market and attract corporate interest. Credits can be transferred up until the date a tax return is filed and they can be carried back to three prior years. That means corporations will know with near certainty how much tax liability they will have before they buy credits, and they will be able to examine how much energy production or investment occurred to be sure that the projects will qualify for the tax credits.</p><p>There are potential hitches with transferable tax credits, which are different from tradable renewable-energy credits used in state and other regulatory systems.</p><p>For one, depreciation deductions from renewable-energy projects can't be traded with the credits. So energy companies either have to forgo those deductions, use them themselves or stay in a typical tax-equity structure.</p><p>The tax credits can be transferred only once, so there won't be a fully liquid trading market. Instead, buyers and sellers will need to find each other and negotiate sales. JPMorgan executives expect a three-part market: traditional tax equity; long-term projects where banks commit to multiple years of credit purchases; and an annual market where nonbanks buy credits.</p><p>One big unknown is pricing. The bigger the discount, the more attractive to potential buyers, who would rather pay $80 for $100 of tax credits than $90. But lower prices would also indicate an inefficient subsidy, with more public support going to investors and less to renewable-energy projects. Mr. Knapp, of CohnReznick, said he expects prices to settle between 80 cents and 96 cents on the dollar.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>To what extent will the new tax-credit market attract capital to renewable-energy projects? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Prices might vary based on the history and strength of the company, with solar and wind producers with long, successful records commanding smaller discounts.</p><p>\"It's going to be harder than people realize to sell tax credits because the buyers will want to be indemnified in case the tax credits are not there. And they will want someone creditworthy as a counterparty,\" said Keith Martin, a deal lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.</p><p>Energy companies will also want to provide assurances that their projects will qualify for bonus credits available when they pay higher wages or use domestic materials.</p><p>Under the law, the person who receives the credits in a transfer bears certain risks, including penalties for excessive claims, and some buyers might seek insurance.</p><p>\"The seller is going to have to generate the comfort for the buyer,\" said Brian Murphy, a partner at accounting firm EY LLP. \"There's a lot of wait and see of how this market will evolve.\"</p><p>Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Climate Law Sparks New Market for Trading Tax Credits</p>",
