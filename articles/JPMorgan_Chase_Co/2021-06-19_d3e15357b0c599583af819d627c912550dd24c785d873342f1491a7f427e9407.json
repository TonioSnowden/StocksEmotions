  "title": "EXCHANGE --- EU Opens Bond Sale to Big Banks --- Institutions excluded earlier due to cartel activity will be eligible for future issuances",
  "text": "<p>When the EU issued 20 billion euros, equivalent to $24 billion, of bonds on Tuesday to raise funds for a fiscal stimulus package, it excluded some of the world's largest banks because of their participation in cartels in bond and currency markets in earlier years. The banks had been penalized for those actions in 2019 and 2021.</p><p>The banks that have been cleared will be eligible to work on future issuances and were informed on Friday, the European Commission, which is the trade bloc's executive arm, said by email. \"Their further exclusion from participation in syndicated transactions in EU bond issuances is not warranted,\" it said.</p><p>The EU expects to sell up to 60 billion euros of long-dated debt this year and 150 billion euros annually through 2026, and plans to use the funds to support member states' economic recovery through a mix of grants and loans. The program, the first major pan-European debt program, will eventually raise around 800 billion euros over five years.</p><p>JPMorgan, Bank of America, Barclays, Credit Agricole, Citigroup, Nomura and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Other banks didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The EU ban referenced four cases of cartels that were penalized in 2019 and 2021. Nomura and UniCredit were fined nearly 130 million euros and 69 million euros, respectively, in May for illegally colluding on trades in European government bonds.</p><p>In April, Bank of America received a penalty of 12.6 million euros for coordinating prices for sovereign bonds denominated in dollars, while Credit Agricole was fined nearly 4 million euros.</p><p>Deutsche participated in a bond trading cartel. It wasn't fined because it informed the EU, but was still banned from the bond sale.</p><p>In 2019, the EU fined a group of banks including Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup 1.07 billion euros for manipulating the foreign-exchange market for 11 currencies including the euro, pound, yen, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar. This was done by exchanging sensitive information and trading plans through online chat rooms.</p><p>Other banks were also involved in these cartels but haven't sought to work on the EU's bond deals.</p>",
