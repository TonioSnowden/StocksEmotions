  "text": "<p>Founded in 2009, the Irvine, Calif.-based startup said last month it would spend up to $5 billion on a second U.S. plant in Georgia, which would have an annual capacity of 400,000 vehicles. Production is slated to start in 2024.</p><p>That's in addition to the 150,000 vehicles a year that Rivian wants to build at its plant in Normal, Ill. The company began manufacturing trucks there in September.</p><p>Rivian, which raised $13.7 billion in gross proceeds at its initial public offering, plans to spend a combined $8 billion on capital expenditures this year and next, focusing on enlarging its factory footprint and paying for research and development, including battery-cell technology.</p><p>Ms. McDonough, who has been CFO for about a year after stints with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG, said she would be a key player in this. \"That's something that I'm intimately focused on, that capital allocation policy,\" she said, adding that her experience leading IPOs and financing rounds equips her with the necessary toolkit to manage Rivian's interactions with investors. The company has raised more than $20 billion in the past three years, including from Ford Motor Co. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. Rivian was valued at $76.16 billion on Thursday, less than the market capitalization of General Motors Co., with $91.6 billion, or Ford, with $97.3 billion.</p><p>---</p><p>Ben Foldy contributed to this article.</p>",
