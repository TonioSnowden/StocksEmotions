  "text": "<p>   A group of Senate Democrats have privately voiced their opposition to President Biden's nomination of Saule Omarova to become a top banking regulator, likely scuttling the academic's chances of confirmation. </p><p>   Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Mark Warner of Virginia -- centrist Democrats -- conveyed their opposition to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) on a Wednesday phone call, said a person familiar with the discussion. </p><p>   The conversation, reported earlier by Axios, came after Messrs. Warner and Tester challenged Ms. Omarova at a Nov. 18 hearing over her past writing and thinking on banking oversight. The Cornell University law professor is Mr. Biden's pick to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees large national banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. </p><p>   Mr. Tester also pressed her at the hearing over remarks she made earlier this year calling for smaller oil-and-gas companies to go bankrupt to aid the U.S. in tackling climate change. </p><p>   Ms. Omarova responded to Mr. Tester at the hearing by saying she misspoke and that her remarks weren't well framed. \"My intention was . . . exactly the opposite,\" she said. \"We need to help those companies to get restructured.\" </p><p>   Ms. Omarova didn't respond to an email Friday seeking comment. Spokesmen for Mr. Tester and Ms. Sinema declined to comment, as did spokeswomen for Messrs. Brown and Warner. </p><p>   A White House official defended Ms. Omarova but didn't comment on Democratic opposition. The official said that Ms. Omarova, who was born in Kazakhstan when it was part of the Soviet Union, has been the target of \"unacceptable red baiting from Republicans like it's the McCarthy era.\" The Biden administration continues to \"strongly support her historic nomination,\" the official said. </p><p>   Ms. Omarova's past academic work calling for shrinking big banks and creating a much bigger role for the Federal Reserve in consumer banking has generated a backlash. Industry advocates and some Republicans have said she favors policies that would effectively nationalize lending and envisions an overly large role for the government that would crimp banks' business. </p><p>   Ms. Omarova's defenders include liberal-leaning Democrats such as Mr. Brown and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. They say she is an accomplished banking expert who would stand up to the industry. </p><p></p>",
