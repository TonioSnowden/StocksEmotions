  "title": "How Farfetch prospered in a pandemic year",
  "text": "<p>José Neves, founder of online fashion retailer Farfetch, pulled off a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70cb83bf-69dd-4f31-9f01-162128ff7e7f\">landmark deal</a> last November, even as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the global economy. </p> <p>The soft-spoken Portuguese entrepreneur and self-described tech geek clinched a $1.1bn investment from two of Farfetch's biggest competitors — tech giant Alibaba and Swiss watch and jewellery group Richemont, which also owns luxury e-tailer Yoox Net-a-Porter. Together, they will jointly expand in China, the world's second-largest and fastest-growing luxury market. </p> <p>Farfetch's shares rose 8 per cent that day, triggering a run in which they would almost double by year-end as investors realised that Covid-19 had changed luxury shoppers' habits for good.</p> <p>It was a dramatic reversal of fortune. Less than a year ago, many investors were questioning whether Farfetch was little more than an overhyped e-commerce player saddled with high marketing and technology costs that would struggle to ever turn a profit. Its shares hit an all-time low of $7.05 in March, far below their 2018 initial public offering price.</p> <p>Now Neves was teaming up with two of the biggest names in tech and luxury in China, just as the pandemic pushed the industry's centre of gravity to Asia. </p> <p>“I think it's going to be very powerful,” Neves says in an interview from his home in Portugal. “Alibaba and Farfetch share a vision of how luxury will evolve in the next five or 10 years, and we think we can build something amazing with them.”</p> <p>In addition to Alibaba and Richemont, further endorsement for the deal came from Kering's billionaire founder, François-Henri Pinault, who invested €50m via his personal holding company.</p> <p>The fact that Neves had managed to corral rivals to collaborate was further proof that the pandemic had brought a reckoning in an industry that had once been slow to move online. It also underscored how the 46-year-old has become a force to be reckoned with in luxury and fashion after years spent on its periphery. </p> <p>He started in 2008 by patiently cajoling fashion boutiques to put their inventory on Farfetch, and only much later won the trust of luxury's top-tier names such as Gucci and Fendi by convincing them that selling on his site would not damage their brands. </p> <p>Neves's choice of a business model that differs from other online retailers such as Net-a-Porter or Matches Fashion has proven crucial: Farfetch would not buy any inventory and therefore took less risk on fleeting trends. Instead, it acted as a marketplace that connected fashion-hungry shoppers to boutiques or brands and earned a commission of about 30 per cent on each sale. It also helped boutiques with the cumbersome work of photographing each piece, creating a modelling studio in its Porto office.</p> <p>Although its complex logistics are invisible to shoppers, Neves built Farfetch as a technology company whose platform matched supply with demand, while handling the painful details of transport, payments and customs to deliver to shoppers in 190 countries. Its system can now dispatch a €4,600 Balenciaga velvet red coat from a store in France to the door of a consumer in Beijing in under four days. </p> <p>“Originally the business was quite narrow, of just putting the boutiques' inventory online, but it has since expanded as José's ambitions grew,” says Frederic Court, a venture capitalist who was among Farfetch's earliest backers. In 2015, the company created another business to provide technology, software and services to help department stores such as Harrods and brands including Thom Browne to run their e-commerce operations. </p> <p>When the pandemic hit, the distributed nature of Farfetch's business meant that it could still deliver even when one region or country entered lockdown — unlike Net-a-Porter, which was paralysed last spring when its UK warehouse briefly shut down. According to analysts' predictions, Farfetch's sales are expected to have leapt 60 per cent last year to reach $1.65bn in 2020. Farfetch has promised that the uplift from Covid-19 will help it deliver its first annual profit (on an adjusted basis) this year. </p> <p>Farfetch's rising share price has also added to Neves' net worth, which Forbes recently estimated at $2.8bn via his roughly 15 per cent stake in the company. </p> <p>Throughout the rollercoaster, Neves, who is the father of five (soon to be six) children from two marriages, has remained his calm and steady self, according to people who know him.</p> <p>When I ask what is the biggest crisis Farfetch has faced since Covid-19 struck, he rejects the very premise of the question. Instead he tells a story of how, at a particularly challenging moment, one of his top executives angrily asked him what it would take for the company to press the panic button. “Never, never hit the panic button,” says Neves. </p> <p>“My answer to him was a very Buddhist one — there is never a crisis moment. Life deals you cards and you play with the ones you have, good or bad. The question we need to ask is what is our endgame. In poker it's clear, but in life it's not always so.”</p> <p>People who have worked with Neves says he was always clear about his own endgame: namely to marry his twin passions for technology and fashion to help the industry transition to the internet era.</p> <p>He was born in Porto as an only child to two working parents and had severe asthma, which led the family to move to a small seaside town for his health. “I had no one to play with for a two-mile radius,” he recalls. “It was quite lonely.” His parents bought him his first computer at the age of eight, on which he learned to code. </p> <p>His interest in fashion developed after he finished his university studies in economics. Aged 22, Neves founded Swear, a shoe brand that made vertiginously high platform boots with a punk vibe, and he also opened a small boutique on Neal Street in London's Covent Garden. </p> <p>Neves had the idea for Farfetch in 2007. His aim was to sign up small boutiques that were not online and connect them to buyers anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Starting with the boutiques was also Neves's way of doing an end-run around the luxury giants who tightly control distribution of their products to protect their exclusivity. “José played a long game of starting with the boutiques to show what Farfetch could do,” says Danny Rimer, an investor at Index Ventures, which backed Farfetch in 2012. “He thought the big brands would never talk to us until the boutiques talked us up to them. And he was right.”</p> <p>Neves admits that winning the trust of the industry's leaders was difficult. “It took a long time, many trips to Paris and Milan, lots of meetings and patience,” he says. A key moment came in 2017 when Kering-owned Gucci signed up to sell directly on Farfetch, the first major brand to do so.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2021, and luxury brands have joined Farfetch en masse, now making up 40 per cent of sellers and half of the supply, according to JPMorgan estimates. Neves slowly wore down their scepticism by offering them a model that suited their interests, known as “direct e-concessions”. Brands decided what they sell on Farfetch and set their own prices to avoid dreaded discounting that could dilute their high-end image.</p> <p>Nevertheless there are notable holdouts — the biggest, most profitable brands such as Louis Vuitton, Hermès, or Chanel do not need Farfetch and prefer to sell directly to customers. And as luxury brands raise their game online and sell more via their own websites, it could spell trouble for Farfetch. </p> <p>Neves believes that fashion's transition to digital and the blurring between online and bricks-and-mortar shopping is such a big opportunity — especially in China — that there will be room for both models. But he is also hedging his bets in interesting ways. In 2019, Farfetch paid $675m to buy New Guards Group, which owns the licence for the popular label Off-White and other streetwear brands, effectively moving Farfetch into design, production and brand development.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae46e11c-babc-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203\">Investors disliked the unexpected acquisition</a> and sent Farfetch shares down by almost 40 per cent on the day. Neves admits he had not done a good job explaining his idea that New Guards would incubate new brands that would be available exclusively on Farfetch — a bit like how Netflix pivoted to produce original content.</p> <p>But the ambitious entrepreneur will be forgiven for the occasional strategic mis-step if he can continue to expand Farfetch's appeal to luxury shoppers in the coming years, especially in China. </p> <p>In the meantime, Neves says he would stay focused on one thing: “How will people shop for luxury in five, 10 years time? That's the only question that matters.”</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Leila Abboud 2021 'How Farfetch prospered in a pandemic year' FT.com 11 February.
