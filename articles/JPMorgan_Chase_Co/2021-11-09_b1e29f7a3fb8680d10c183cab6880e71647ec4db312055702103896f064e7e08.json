  "title": "Oreo on the path to adding $1 billion in sales with help from its largest U.S. launch, Oreo x Pokémon",
  "text": "<p>During the third quarter, the food giant launched Oreo x Pokémon, a limited-edition cookie featuring 16 different Pokémon designs. It was the fastest selling edition of the iconic sandwich cookie of all time in the U.S.</p><p>According to Dirk Van de Put, Mondelez's chief executive, it beat out previous launches with Game of Thrones and Lady Gaga.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Oreo/status/1440744194939650050“Oreo continues to ‘wow' with its growth,” wrote Stifel analysts in a note published after Mondelez announced its third-quarter results.</p><p>Mondelez MDLZ beat earnings and revenue expectations and raised full-year revenue expectations. Adjusted EPS totaled 71 cents per share, and revenue reached $7.18 billion.</p><p>“That level of growth would push the sales of Oreo over $4 billion globally,” analysts said.</p><p>Stifel rates Mondelez shares buy with a $67 price target.</p><p>Other brands in the Mondelez portfolio include Cadbury, Ritz, Toblerone and Triscuit.</p><p>“We view the combination of a strong headline organic sales growth figure and a non-disastrous gross margin miss as a small win for this name today,” wrote JPMorgan in its post-earnings note.</p><p>See: Starbucks launches a new Almondmilk Latte for the holidays</p><p>“The 66 basis-point miss was actually lighter than most misses in packaged food lately.”</p><p>JPMorgan rates Mondelez stock overweight with a $73 price target.</p><p>“While the top-line beat only translated to a penny of upside to EPS, we came away confident that Mondelez can comfortably achieve its FY21 earnings guidance.”</p><p>UBS rates Mondelez stock buy with a $72 price target.</p><p>Mondelez says price increases of an overall net average of 6% to 7% will go into effect in the U.S. on Jan. 1, 2022.</p><p>Mondelez stock has gained 6.5% for the year to date while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 24.6% for the period.</p>",
