  "text": "<p>(Lyons Press, 227 pages, $27.95)</p><p>Well-paid drones who toil into the night as associates in big law firms owe a debt of some kind to William Nelson Cromwell, an early architect of the Wall Street partnership Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. He was fond of saying: \"A successful man never forgets his work.\" Try telling that to your family on a Saturday night. Then there was Paul Cravath, who pretty much invented the modern law business as an assembly line for Ivy League grads grinding away at minute tasks -- in Cravath's less-than-inspiring words, each \"a cog in the machinery of a big law office.\"</p><p>In the late 19th century, law was an industry of idiosyncratic, tiny partnerships. Cravath imposed an organizational rigor. Associates at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore labored for eight to 10 years with only a faint hope of making partner but the promise of a golden rainbow for those who did.</p><p>In \"The Anointed: New York's White-Shoe Law Firms,\" Jeremiah D. Lambert and Geoffrey S. Stewart tell the story of three firms -- Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell is the third -- that came to dominate Wall Street in the early 20th century and established a model that, in many respects, endures today.</p><p>There was much to admire in the firms' culture. John W. Davis once chided an associate at Davis Polk for not wearing a hat, then gave him $10 to buy one. In Davis's day, leading partners were active in philanthropy and bar associations -- almost a requirement of their social class -- and many did stints in government. After the outbreak of World War I, Paul Cravath was influential in prodding the U.S. to become involved on the side of Britain and France. He saw the Allies' success as pivotal to American values, and also critical to the interests of a big Cravath client, Bethlehem Steel.</p><p>Some of these partners showed flashes of enlightened thinking. Cravath, the son of a Congregationalist minister, was chairman of Fisk University, a black college, and expressed concern for the \"broad problem of Negro education and race relations.\" John Davis was first among 50 New York lawyers, in 1933, to petition the secretary of state to protest Hitler's purge of Jewish lawyers. Yet as the authors note, such lawyers \"rarely considered the hiring practices of their own firms.\"</p><p>With sublime separation of principle and practice, Cravath never troubled to hire a black attorney, nor would Davis Polk think of hiring a Jew. Catholics fared almost as badly, and women lawyers were not to be seen. The firms' prejudices can be laid off to the times, but on closer inspection the early partners appear less admirable than their gauzy legends suggest. Their clubbiness was an outgrowth of a social elitism that sneered at competition as unseemly.</p><p>The firms had longstanding ties to Wall Street banks (Davis Polk's offices were connected by elevator to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.). Once they had mastered the intricacies of railroad and utility financing, they could count on repeat business. One great source of billings was working on reorganizations of their own failed deals. The partners rarely poached one another's clients, much less their talent. Associates were paid by seniority rather than merit. The firms operated with all the smugness of a \"legal cartel,\" as the authors aptly put it.</p><p>Moreover, their reputation for probity was overstated. William Cromwell was overinvolved in lobbying for a canal through Panama while secretly enriching himself from a syndicate he organized to profit from the U.S. government'sparticipation. Paul Cravath was the subject of a serious ethical complaint. Separately, Hoyt A. Moore, a name partner in the firm, appears to have been involved in bribing a federal judge, though he wasn't charged. According to the authors -- both longtime white-shoe practitioners, Mr. Lambert having trained at Cravath, Mr. Stewart at Davis Polk -- law at the time was \"a ruffians' game, if one played by gentlemen.\"</p><p>Few lawyers set a worse example than John Foster Dulles, who ran Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as a stepping stone to his career as a diplomat. In the 1920s, he was a fervent promoter of lending to German corporations, despite Germany's precarious monetary condition. By the Depression, more than $1 billion in foreign bonds arranged by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell were worthless.</p><p>Dulles didn't stop there. To the horror of his partners, he provided legal cover for German-American trade while Hitler was building a military juggernaut. As late as 1937, Dulles dismissed fears of German, Japanese or Italian aggression as the product of \"hysteria.\" He parlayed his relentless international labors into becoming Eisenhower's secretary of state.</p><p>By regimenting the practice of law, white-shoe pioneers made it unlikely for later generations to emulate their outsize careers. Cravath became a partner in his mid-20s -- unthinkable today. Cromwell was hired as a bookkeeper and sent to Columbia Law School by the firm's founder. Some structure in the industry was needed, but the Cravath system emphasized early and soul-crushing specialization. Cravath himself admitted he had been lucky to avoid it.</p><p>Messrs. Lambert and Stewart say that white-shoe dominance eroded as prejudice in society faded. More nearly, the success of Jewish firms and those of other outsiders persuaded the old guard to abandon caste, lest they lapse into irrelevance. \"The Anointed\" shows evidence of a great deal of research, and the subject is fascinating. Unfortunately, the writing is plodding, and the text is dense with detail. The authors adopt a silo approach, going over similar ground for each firm. We don't need to read that Sullivan \"became the world's largest law firm\" twice in eight pages. And it seems unpardonable to call James Landis, rather than Joseph P. Kennedy, the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>The authors' central (if implicit) point is a good one. The old era was ruled by loyalty and social connections. The profit motive that replaced it may have been crass, but it imposed a welcome regime of merit.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Lowenstein is the author of \"America's Bank.\" His father was a corporate lawyer in New York.</p>",
