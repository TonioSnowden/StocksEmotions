  "text": "<p>Shares of Goldman Sachs GS fell 6.4% in afternoon trading on Tuesday, paring earlier loss of as much as 8.8%, but the selloff still weighed heavily on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA. If the losses hold by the end of the session, it would be the biggest one-day percentage drop since the stock fell 8.7% on June 26, 2020, according to FactSet data. The stock's $24.26 price decline was shaving about 160 points off the Dow's price, while the Dow fell 444 points, or 1.2%.</p><p>CEO David Solomon warned about risks in the economy tied to inflation on a call with analysts.</p><p>“It makes sense that coming out of the recent period of easy monetary policy,&#xa0;inflation&#xa0;may be above-trend for some time, and in the near-term,&#xa0;inflationary pressures may continue to intensify before they start to decrease,” Solomon said.</p><p>“I also believe that we could see more volatility as these easing policies are unwound, which will likely have an impact on economic growth, asset prices, and client activity,” he said.</p><p>Don't miss: Fed to use upcoming policy meeting to get ducks in a row for March liftoff.</p><p>While the bank's latest results included plenty of bright spots such as its investment banking business, Goldman said revenue at its global markets and asset management units shrank from year-ago levels.</p><p>CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon said Goldman's higher compensation expenses and bad debt provision expenses contributed to its earnings miss. He reiterated a strong buy rating on the stock, but trimmed his 12-month price target by $30 to $440 a share.</p><p>Goldman Sachs shares have slumped 13.8% over the past three months, but have gained 18.5% over the past 12 months, while the Dow has advanced 15.1% over the past year.</p><p>The bank ran into some of the same headwinds as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and Jefferies Co. JEF, as the impact of the&#xa0;omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19&#xa0;on the economy sent&#xa0;Treasury yields&#xa0;sharply lower during the quarter.</p><p>&#xa0;See:Wells Fargo outshines JPMorgan as big banks kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season</p><p>Goldman's fourth-quarter net earnings of $3.81 billion, or $10.81 a share, fell short of the Wall Street estimate of $11.77 a share in a FactSet survey of analysts. In the year-ago quarter, Goldman reported earnings of $4.36 billion or $12.08 a share.</p><p>Total revenue increased 8% to $12.64 billion, ahead of the consensus analyst estimate of $12.04 billion.</p><p>Broken out, the firm's investment banking revenue increased to $3.6 billion, ahead of the FactSet target of $3.24 billion and above the year-ago tally of $2.72 billion.</p><p>Net revenue in global markets fell 7% to $3.99 billion. The figure included an 11% drop in equities trading revenue to $2.12 billion.</p><p>Asset management revenue dropped 10% to $2.89 billion amid lower revenue in equity investments and lending and debt investments, offset by a boost in incentive fees.</p><p>Revenue at consumer and wealth management climbed 19% to $1.97 billion.</p><p>Provision for credit losses rose to $344 million from $293 million.</p><p>Operating expenses rose 23% to $7.27 billion, as compensation and benefits expenses jumped 31%, and as technology costs also increased.</p><p>Head count rose to 43,900 as of Dec. 31, up from 43,000 as of Sept. 30, and up 8.4% from 40,500 a year ago.</p><p>Addressing compensation costs, CEO Solomon said the corporate sector continues to experience real wage inflation across sectors.</p><p>“Coming out of last year after we went through the compensation process, there were definitely places where I think with hindsight and with the constantly-evolving environment of COVID and supply chain changes, the monetary and fiscal policy environment, what they did to savings rates, et cetera, where there was a real base pressure on what I call base kind of compensation and wage levels,” Solomon said. For full-year 2021 results, Goldman said it set records in revenue ($59.34 billion), net earnings ($21.64 billion) and earnings per share of $59.45. Its return on average common shareholder equity was 23%, the highest since 2007.</p><p>Also Read:JPMorgan, Goldman profit updates may shape bank stock rally</p>",
