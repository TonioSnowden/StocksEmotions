  "text": "<p>The report shows resilience of the economic recovery and suggests households are boosting spending as schools and offices reopen. Consumers shelled out more online and in retail stores broadly, and on furniture. In the year through August, overall sales rose 15.1%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Delta, a highly contagious strainof the Covid-19 virus, could have weighed on certain segments, such as restaurants. Sales at food-service providers were flat, though they were still up sharply from a year earlier.</p><p>Retail sales—including spending on restaurant meals, cars, cellphones and computers—are a big slice of consumer spending, which itself is the largest source of economic demand in the U.S.</p><p>Problems associated with the Delta variant have led economists in recent days to downgrade estimates for economic growth in the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday projected gross domestic product to expand at a 5% annual rate in July through September, down from a prior estimate of 7%, citing lower demand and production shortages, particularly in the car industry.</p><p>There are signs the Delta variant wave has crested. Economists believe retail sales could recover quickly as more Americans become vaccinated and feel safe again to venture out, and as product shortages ease. </p><p>Car dealers's inventories are running thin because of a global computer-chip shortage. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 1.8% last month.
