  "text": "<p>America's faith in the ability of billionaires to solve its problems has taken another knock. Three years ago, the triumvirate of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon unveiled a joint initiative to fix the US healthcare system. The Haven venture will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f9b1a8c-800b-44ff-80b7-c4b5a9642966\">dissolve</a> in February.&#xa0;Even the bosses of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan were no match for this sprawling, rent-seeking industry.</p> <p>US healthcare, which has dealt poorly with coronavirus, is worth almost $4tn a year. It is just the kind of legacy set-up tech should be able to skewer. </p> <p>High provider prices and convoluted insurance contracts mean the US is twice as expensive, per capita, as other developed countries at around $11,000 a year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The UK, by comparison, spends less than $5,000. </p> <p>Costs rise more quickly than inflation. In 2020, the average employer-sponsored family premium increased 4 per cent to over <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2020-employer-health-benefits-survey/\">$21,000</a>.</p> <p>The trio's plan was good one. They wanted to use the combined heft of their 1m-plus combined workforce in a non-profit, tech-driven venture, to show what could be achieved without intermediaries.</p> <p>But disruption alone is not a valid business model. Haven's public plans were hazy. Hiring renowned surgeon Dr Atul Gawande as chief executive, someone better known for writing about healthcare than running a business, suggests the project prioritised talking over doing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Haven not only failed to meet its own goals, it spurred consolidation that conferred more pricing power on the industry. </p> <p>Health stocks dropped when the venture was announced in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9de9aca6-05e0-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5?emailId=5a749352401e4000047e9742&amp;segmentId=c393f5a6-b640-bff3-cc14-234d058790ed\">January 2018</a>. Shares in pharmacy group CVS Health fell 6 per cent. So did the stock of health insurer Anthem. Panicked rivals moved fast. Two months later Cigna bought large pharmacy benefits manager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/875b44aa-22ef-11e8-add1-0e8958b189ea\">Express Scripts</a> for $67bn including debt — paying a premium that was not covered by expected savings. Meanwhile, the Trump administration declined to cap drug costs. </p> <p>The killer blow to Haven may have been Amazon's waning interest in a collective effort. Mr Bezos has not given up on his plan to Amazon-ify healthcare for customers and employees. The ecommerce giant has launched online prescription service Amazon Pharmacy and a virtual primary care facility for employees. </p> <p>If Mr Bezos wants to win credit for increasing competition, rather than opprobrium for suppressing it, US healthcare is still a good place to start.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.
