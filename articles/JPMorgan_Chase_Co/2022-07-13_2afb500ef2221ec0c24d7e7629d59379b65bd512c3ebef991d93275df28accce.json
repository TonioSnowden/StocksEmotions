  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Michael Barr is poised to win confirmation as the government's most influential banking regulator after clearing a key procedural Senate hurdle with bipartisan support on Tuesday. </p><p>   The Senate voted 66-27 to advance the nomination of the former Treasury Department official for a seat on the board of the Federal Reserve, setting up a confirmation vote as early as this week. A dean of public policy at the University of Michigan, Mr. Barr faces additional votes that would allow him to serve a four-year term as the Fed's vice chairman for banking supervision. </p><p>   Mr. Barr's confirmation would provide the central bank with a full seven-member board for the first time in nearly a decade and would add to a group of Biden-appointed financial watchdogs. Mr. Barr has a record that suggests he might seek to restore at least some of the financial rules that were eased by the Fed during the Trump administration. </p><p>   The supervision role that Mr. Barr would fill is responsible for developing a broad vision for the regulation of big banks. That includes recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. </p><p></p>",
