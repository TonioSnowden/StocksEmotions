  "title": "Stock Futures Drop in Volatile Trading; Technology stocks were particularly hard hit before the opening bell after Snap issued a profit warning",
  "text": "<p>On Monday, major U.S. indexesrallied, giving investors some breathing room after a volatile trading session the previous week. But by Tuesday, negative sentiment returned to the markets. Asian indexes broadly fell, weighed down by losses among technology stocks. European markets also traded lower.</p><p>Snap's shares fell 28% premarket, following a profit warning on Monday, during which the company noted that the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated more than anticipated. Its losses rippled to other technology stocks, with Meta Platforms down 6.4% before the opening bell and Google-parent Alphabet down 4%. Advanced Micro Devices lost 2%.</p><p>Investors are confronting a range of signals as they try to map out the trajectory of the U.S. economy. Many have grown worried that the Federal Reserve's plans for monetary tightening to tamp down inflation could tip the economy into a recession. That has been among the catalysts for the U.S. stock market's brutal year, which has sent the S&amp;P 500 falling 17% from its January high, based on Monday's close.</p><p>There have been signs of optimism, however, such as on Monday, when JPMorgan Chase said U.S. consumers appear to be in good financial health. But that sanguine depiction was quickly counterbalanced by Snap's warning.</p><p>Later Tuesday, investors will receive new commentary from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who will give remarks at an economic summit in Las Vegas. Investors will be looking for fresh clues about his outlook for inflation, the economy and the path of interest-rate increases.</p><p>Several pieces of economic data are also due Tuesday, including U.S. new-home sales data and gauges of U.S. manufacturing activity.</p><p>Investors are now keeping a close watch on whether the S&amp;P 500 enters bear market territory, defined as a drop of at least 20% from a recent high. On Friday, the benchmark index came close to finishing in a bear market, though it was saved by a late-session rally.</p><p>Tuesday's selloff in technology stocks in the premarket session sent investors scooping up government bonds, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.797% from 2.857% Monday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>Gold, considered another haven asset, advanced 0.5%.</p><p>Oil prices fell. Brent crude, the international benchmark, slipped 0.3% to $113.10 a barrel.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.8%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell about 1.8%. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.9%, while China's Shanghai Composite declined 2.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Drop in Volatile Trading</p>",
