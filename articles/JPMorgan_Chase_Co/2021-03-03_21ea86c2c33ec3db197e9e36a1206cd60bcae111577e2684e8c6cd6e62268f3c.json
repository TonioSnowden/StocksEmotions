  "title": "European Investors Fret Over Bond Selloff  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein",
  "text": "<p>   A sharp rise in European government-bond yields last week is prompting investors to bet on the region's central bank intervening to keep financing costs low. </p><p>   The jump in returns on German and French bonds mirrored the sudden climb in Treasury yields: Investors were selling U.S. government bonds, considered among the safest assets in the world, as they grew more optimistic that the American economy is poised for a sharp recovery. Yields on bonds climb when prices drop. </p><p>   That bout of optimism led to a selloff in government debt in Europe as well, though the economic prospects in the region remain more cloudy. Covid-19 vaccines are being rolled out haltingly across the continent, and the region's proposed recovery spending plan and outlays by individual nations pale in comparison to the trillions of dollars that the U.S. government has spent on relief packages. </p><p>   The yields on both German and French 10-year bonds remain in subzero territory. Still, their sudden rise sparked concern that borrowing costs will climb for businesses, further hampering Europe's economic recovery. Government bonds are used as a reference for determining the cost of other types of debt, including loans to companies. </p><p>   In the U.S., Federal Reserve officials have said the jump in Treasury yields is a healthy move, reflecting investors' improved expectations for the economy. </p><p>   Bond markets on both sides of the Atlantic have also calmed in recent trading sessions. But in both Germany and France, bond yields remain elevated compared with the start of the year. </p><p>   Investors and analysts say the higher yields in the eurozone require close monitoring because of the weaker economic footing. They are counting on the European Central Bank increasing its bond-buying program to help ease borrowing rates. That expectation has already pulled money back into European bonds, investors say. </p><p>   \"Without the European Central Bank's continuous support, funding cost in the euro area is destined [to be] higher, which is something the central bank cannot allow,\" said Althea Spinozzi, a fixed-income strategist at Saxo Bank. </p><p>   The yield on German 10-year government bonds, widely viewed as the benchmark for risk-free assets in Europe, last week reached minus 0.23%, the highest since March 2020. In France, the yield rose above zero for the first time since June. Debt-laden nations in Southern Europe such as Italy and Greece also saw yields jump, before easing this week. </p><p>   Policy makers have taken note of the climb in yields. ECB President Christine Lagarde said Feb. 22 that her institution is closely monitoring this. Other ECB officials have said in recent days that the central bank could boost monetary support to prevent financing conditions from tightening. </p><p>   Investors said words aren't enough. </p><p>   \"It's more about action now: We've seen this week that the verbal interventions haven't really impacted the market,\" said Iain Stealey, chief investment officer of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. </p><p>   The ECB's next monetary policy meeting is on March 11. If the central bank decided to buy more bonds, it would likely be through the pandemic emergency purchase program, which has a budget of 1.85 trillion euros, equivalent to $2.2 trillion, analysts said. The ECB has spent about 850 billion euros to date, leaving it with more capital to deploy. Mr. Stealey expects the yields of German and French government bonds to stabilize.\"We do feel that the European environment isn't really that conducive to higher yields,\" he said. </p><p>   That is because investors' expectations for a halting or subdued economic recovery will bolster demand for the government bonds, which can offer both safety and liquidity in uncertain times. </p><p></p>",
