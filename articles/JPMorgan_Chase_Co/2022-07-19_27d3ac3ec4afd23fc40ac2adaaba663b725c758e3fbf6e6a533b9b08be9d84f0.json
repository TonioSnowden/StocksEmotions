  "title": "Silversmith Backs Aviation Researcher JetNet; The growth investor takes a majority stake in the family-owned business",
  "text": "<p>Boston-based Silversmith is investing out of its third fund, an $880 million pool raised in September 2020. Although the firm didn't disclose the amount of the investment, Mr. Quagliaroli said it falls within the firm's typical range of $30 million to $100 million. JetNet, he said, has revenue in the firm's target range of $10 million to $50 million.</p><p>It was JetNet's first outside investment. For Silversmith, the investment is similar to the $68 million investment it led last year in maintenance management software company TMA Systems LLC, Mr. Quagliaroli said. That investment, like the JetNet one, was a controlling stake in a family-owned business and Mr. Quagliaroli joined the company's board as part of the transaction.</p><p>In addition to Mr. Quagliaroli, JetNet's board includes Silversmith Vice President Ned Kingsley and Senior Associate Becca Katzen as well as minority owner Tony Esposito and Chief Executive Greg Fell.</p><p>Founded in 1988 as a small aircraft listing service, JetNet offers subscription-based services providing intelligence on business aircraft and the aviation industry, from owner or operator information to maintenance records and other market data, trends and insights, such as rankings of the most coveted business aircraft. This year, according to a survey of customer preferences through the first quarter, it is the Pilatus PC-12.</p><p>Utica, N.Y.-based JetNet counts among its customers a swath of aviation industry participants, including broker-dealers, original equipment manufacturers and consultant appraisers. Customers include Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp.'s Gulfstream business-jet unit, Raytheon Technologies Corp.'s Collins Aerospace Systems and Textron Inc., Mr. Quagliaroli said. JetNet plans to expand offerings for financial-services and insurance customers, which today are a small part of its business but that often use such data as part of their appraisal and underwriting process.</p><p>JetNet is also looking at international expansion and potential acquisitions, Mr. Quagliaroli said, adding that a portion of Silversmith's capital commitment beyond its initial investment will go toward such acquisitions.</p><p>Business-jet data from the Federal Aviation Administration show that, after a significant drop in 2020 tied to the pandemic, those aviation operations rebounded to record levels in 2021 and remain elevated this year. Bankers and other analysts typically use business-jet activity as an indicator of economic conditions, the FAA said.</p><p>Health concerns during the pandemic drove demand for shared services, which include charter and fractional operations, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts said in a June report, adding that leisure travel drove demand, even as business travel remained curtailed. JPMorgan, a JetNet client, said that business-jet activity rebounded strongly in 2021, exceeding 2019 levels</p><p>\"The events of the last two years have once again demonstrated the resilience of the aviation industry and aircraft as an asset class,\" Aengus Kelly, chief executive of aircraft leasing business AerCap Holdings NV, said during the company's most recent earnings call. \"Investors are very interested in owning physical assets as a way to provide protection in a higher inflationary environment, supporting both aircraft and engine values.\"</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p>",
