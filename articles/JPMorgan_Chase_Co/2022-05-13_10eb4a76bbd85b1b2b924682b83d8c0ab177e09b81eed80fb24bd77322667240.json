  "text": "<p>\"Dairy, for example, which makes up 28% of our commodity basket, rose almost 25% in Q1. While costs rose throughout the quarter, we experienced a change in sales trajectory from mid-March onward as macroeconomic headwinds accelerated and comps turned negative.\"</p><p>Among those headwinds were higher gas prices.</p><p>See: Starbucks adds Chocolate Cream Cold Brew to the summer menu</p><p>And: Starbucks plans to invest roughly $200 million to tackle increased demand for customized cold beverage orders</p><p>Dutch Bros. BROS, like so many other companies, raised prices to manage inflation, but Ricci says the increases were \"less than half as much as many of our peers.\"</p><p>The company reported late-Wednesday a wider-than-expected loss for the quarter, though revenue beat expectations. Same-store sales grew 6%.</p><p>It now expects \"at least $90 million\" in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) for the year, down from a target range of $115 million to $120 million previously. And for the second quarter, the company is guiding for flat-to-slightly negative same-store sales. The FactSet consensus is for a 1.1% increase.</p><p>Despite the results, JPMorgan said \"buy the reset.\"</p><p>\"Dutch Bros completed their IPO on Sept. 14, 2021 priced at $23 per share. Approximately 60% of trading days since that time the shares traded above $50,\" analysts say.</p><p>\"The ~16% decline in shares the day earnings were released after market, and ~37% decline in after hours trading is a major reset in the company's valuation.\"</p><p>JPMorgan rates Dutch Bros. stock overweight and cut its price target to $36 from $58.</p><p>Stifel downgraded Dutch Bros. stock rating to hold from buy, and slashed its price target to $30 from $70.</p><p>\"We believe the situation Dutch Bros. finds itself in increases the risk that pricing actions could have unforeseen consequences on frequency and traffic trends,\" analysts said.</p><p>\"For example, management highlighted that younger consumers had pulled back on purchase frequency, hurting the late afternoon and evening dayparts.\"</p><p>Dutch Bros. shares have lost 50.7% for the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has declined 17.5%.</p><p>Dutch Bros. results milked by 25% spike in Q1 dairy prices</p>",
