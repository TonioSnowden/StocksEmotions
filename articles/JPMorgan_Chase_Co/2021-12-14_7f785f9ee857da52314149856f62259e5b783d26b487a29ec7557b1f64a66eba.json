  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> <strong>NSO Group</strong>, the Israeli spyware manufacturer whose military-grade Pegasus malware has drawn the scrutiny of human rights groups, is <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/c3e90890-0a4d-4290-a111-cb37a5b7d502\">considering a sale or shutdown</a> of the unit, according to two people familiar with the discussions.</p> <h2>Orcel pulls off the gloves&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Andrea Orcel</strong> will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4ff2402-6817-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056\">the first to admit</a> he isn't one to let things go. </p> <p>Call it stubbornness or strong will, the kick-boxing banker has proven his stamina in the ring. After a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a792bc2-2afb-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\">two-and-a-half-year spar</a> over the terms of his former employment with <strong>Santander</strong>, the now boss of <strong>UniCredit</strong> has emerged victorious in court. </p> <p>The rift began in 2019 when Orcel sued the Spanish lender led by <strong>Ana Botín</strong> for rescinding a job offer to be its new chief executive. The hard-charging Italian punched back, and Santander <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da35450-cc8c-402f-93d9-3e381ea396ad\">was ordered to pay</a> Orcel €68m in compensation last week. </p> <p>The legal affront was especially bold given Orcel's decades-long relationship with the <strong>Botín </strong>family. </p> <p>But a courtroom battle — “unfortunate or not” — was “the right thing to do because there was no other way”, Orcel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2beff6f1-d032-48dc-a616-44b4bc07be5c\">told the FT</a> just before the ruling was announced. </p> <p>Orcel's persistence hasn't always paid off, however. &#xa0;</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/979b0784-081e-4251-9d07-ec1a2035e1f6\">replacing</a> <strong>Jean Pierre Mustier</strong> as head of UniCredit earlier this year, one of the new chief's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/517a0311-23d6-4bfb-8174-f3adc480f48b\">first orders of business</a> was to tick off a long-held priority of UniCredit's chair <strong>Pier Carlo Padoan</strong>: the takeover of Italy's<strong> Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena</strong>. </p> <p>Padoan — the former Italian finance minister — had failed to get the plan past Mustier, who prioritised building UniCredit into a global institution over chasing domestic deals. This was Orcel's chance to exercise politics in his favour. </p> <p>But after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a020dcba-d135-4ef9-8e67-ba44bc1921be\">months of negotiations</a>, the plan to carve up MPS <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6177e26-5118-42db-b48a-8b2117de6e79\">went sour</a>. Central to the deal's collapse was a lack of consensus on how much capital the government would be required to inject into MPS. </p> <p>Orcel, whose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/384f3b70-b08e-4761-9236-3cbf6d88dc51\">€7.5m pay package</a> makes him Italy's highest-paid banker, may have overplayed his hand by demanding a reported €6.5bn from the government to revive the Tuscan lender. </p> <p>Perhaps Orcel was taking lessons learnt from some of his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b3908b8-f29e-11e4-b914-00144feab7de\">regrettable deals</a> of the past. He famously advised <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> on its disastrous €72bn takeover of the Dutch bank <strong>ABN Amro</strong> in 2007, which contributed heavily to RBS's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9da3a77e-f031-3162-a830-3d77f5ed3323\">collapse</a>.</p> <p>The MPS debacle has eaten over half of Orcel's time at the helm. Though Orcel hasn't ruled out a future deal for the smaller Italian bank, he must focus on a new strategy.</p> <p>The path forward doesn't have to involve a new deal. Orcel has already revamped UniCredit's management team, simplified its structure and reduced duplicate roles, and seen profits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10c2c3f6-f655-42c5-abea-febeb025f575\">lift 55 per cent</a> in the third quarter. </p> <p>As Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00932b45-43c7-43ba-9957-cc693b5e846c\">points out</a>, however, the bank's financial gains would likely have prevailed even if Mustier never left. Striking the right deal could help Orcel reclaim the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b3908b8-f29e-11e4-b914-00144feab7de\">“X Factor”</a> his fans once lauded him for. &#xa0;</p> <h2>A-Rod: JPMorgan's MVP</h2> <p><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong> might be the most coveted client at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>. &#xa0;</p> <p>The retired baseball star has become a central character in the internal strife at the US banking giant, with different bankers fighting over who gets to manage his multimillion-dollar fortune.</p> <p>The dispute spilled out into public view after <strong>Gwen Campbell</strong>, a financial adviser at JPMorgan Advisors, filed for a restraining order against her own employer to prevent what she alleges has been an effort by co-workers at a separate division of JPMorgan to poach her clients, including Rodriguez. </p> <p>Rodriguez is not named in Campbell's filing but people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b7ae6dc-b213-4463-b980-3b0401087187\">told the FT's Josh Franklin</a> that the “Pro Athlete Client” refers to Rodriguez. </p> <p>Before joining JPMorgan in October last year, Campbell was courted for several months. The process included a conversation with <strong>Mary Erdoes</strong>, the head of JPMorgan's powerful asset and wealth management division, at A-Rod's Super Bowl party last year. </p> <p>Campbell is Rodriguez's longtime financial adviser, and alleges that her colleagues at JPMorgan's private bank have been trying to poach him since she joined the Wall Street firm. </p> <p>The rift highlights a turf war between separate but overlapping business divisions at JPMorgan, which Campbell likened to a “shark tank” — tensions that grew more cut-throat when the bank acquired <strong>Bear Stearns</strong> during the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>JPMorgan Advisors, the old Bear Stearns financial advisory business where Campbell works, sits within JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division. The private bank sits within the Erdoes-controlled asset and wealth management division. </p> <p>“You don't feel like you're working at the same company. You feel like you're working at different firms,” said one former JPMorgan private banker.</p> <h2>The Thai conglomerate looking to wrap up Selfridges</h2> <p>DD has been following a deal we hear will be signed in time for the holiday season: <strong>Central Group</strong> of Thailand, owned by the billionaire <strong>Chirathivat</strong> family, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc6bf884-7e47-40e3-8581-008594c2c3a8\">poised to buy</a> the UK department store chain <strong>Selfridges</strong> from the Canadian branch of the <strong>Westons</strong>.</p> <p>Early in the sale process, which is being led by Credit Suisse, there were other names <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/134c756c-e220-44ec-a82c-afc0099bf9b1\">circling the asset</a>, such as the private equity group <strong>Apollo </strong>and Qatari investors.</p> <p>But after a handshake in London at the beginning of this month, Central and its bankers at <strong>Citigroup</strong> have been locked in marathon Zoom video calls with the sellers. The aim is to get the deal done before Christmas, according to one party to the sale. </p> <p>Central <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a072f92c-47de-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441\">already owns</a> some of the poshest names in European top-end retailing:<strong> Rinascente</strong> in Italy, <strong>KaDeWe</strong> in Germany and <strong>Globus </strong>in Switzerland. All that's missing now is a top London store.</p> <p>The sale price, estimated at about £4bn, would be steep even for one of Thailand's biggest conglomerates. And Central's listed retail unit has faced a rotten year, like the rest of Thai business, thanks to a surge of the Covid-19 Delta variant. &#xa0;</p> <p>But as one person close to the sale said, Selfridges is a property of the kind that trades once in a generation. </p> <p>One way the deal might get done would be for Central to bid together with <strong>Signa</strong>, the Austrian real estate holding founded by the billionaire <strong>René Benko</strong> with which it teamed up with to buy Globus. </p> <p>The keys to Selfridges would be a rich prize for Central, founded by Chinese immigrant <strong>Tiang Chirathivat </strong>(aka <strong>Zheng Ni Tiang</strong>) in a shophouse on the wrong side of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. The FT's John Reed takes you deeper on the billionaire family <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc6bf884-7e47-40e3-8581-008594c2c3a8\">here</a>. </p> <p>Lest anyone wants to get snotty or write off the Thais as parvenus or “dumb money”, it's worth remembering that <strong>Harry Gordon Selfridge</strong> was a foreigner too (an American) who arrived in London unimpressed by the city's retail scene.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Francesco De Ferrari</strong>, former chief executive of the Australian finance group <strong>AMP</strong> and <strong>Credit Suisse </strong>alum, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa4d2369-7cb4-496f-b098-00d855ec6388\">has rejoined</a> the Swiss bank to run its revamped wealth management division. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has appointed <strong>Aamir Khan </strong>as a managing director in its UK investment banking coverage team. He will join in February from <strong>HSBC</strong>, where he was a managing director on its M&amp;A team. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cib.barclays/news-and-events/barclays-corporate-investment-bank-promotes-2022-managing-directors.html\">has promoted</a> 85 bankers within its corporate and investment banking units to managing director, effective January 1. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>SVB Financial Group</strong>, the parent of <strong>Silicon Valley Bank</strong>, has acquired the New York-based research firm <strong>MoffettNathanson</strong>. The group's senior research analysts <strong>Craig Moffett</strong>, <strong>Michael Nathanson </strong>and<strong> Lisa Ellis</strong> and their teams will join SVB as a result.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>CVC</strong> has appointed <strong>Jiri Zrust </strong>as a partner and head of infrastructure. He will join the private equity group in March from <strong>Macquarie Group</strong>'s infrastructure funds business, where he was most recently a senior managing director and head of energy transition. &#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Leveraged battle</strong> Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren's aim to challenge the concept of limited liability is a proposal that threatens to overhaul the Chapter 11 bankruptcy system in the US and issue a massive check on private equity's power.
