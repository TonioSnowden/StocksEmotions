  "title": "Rally Shows Buyback Risk for Bed Bath Beyond --- GameStop frenzy gave retailer a boost, but could affect its share-repurchase agreement",
  "text": "<p>The culprit is an accelerated share-repurchase agreement that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced well before the rally pushed up stocks like the company's own. Such an agreement exposes the company to the short end of the trade, on the same side as the hedge funds that the day traders were out to deplete. For a heavily shorted stock initiating an ASR, an army of investors out to destroy short sellers can be a truly terrifying scenario.</p><p>While ASRs are nothing new, the sheer magnitude of stock price surges this past week highlights the potential riskiness of the method.</p><p>In an ASR, a company buys back shares in one large chunk from a dealer -- in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's case, it was JPMorgan -- that typically will deliver shares it borrowed from institutional investors. The bank must then cover its short position by buying back the company's shares in the open market over a period. If the share price rises, the company must compensate the bank for the difference between what it paid the bank for the initial share delivery and what the bank paid to buy those shares in the market, typically based on a volume-weighted average price. This difference can be settled either by cash or shares.</p><p>In some cases, a company will structure an ASR with \"collars\" or caps on the per-share price it will ultimately have to pay, limiting downside in case share prices spike. In many cases, including Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's, the agreement is uncollared. Dollar Tree and Monsanto are among the companies that bought back shares using this structure.</p><p>The impact of these buybacks on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's bottom line, if any, won't be apparent until future earnings results. It said on Monday that it completed the $225 million ASR that was announced in October, paying an average of $20.77 per share. But the company also initiated a $150 million add-on ASR on Jan. 11, which means JPMorgan has already delivered a second chunk of shares. After the GameStop rally pushed Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's own shares up to $52.89 (they started the year below $20), the company said Monday that it pushed back the maturity date of the add-on ASR from February to April, citing \"extreme market volatility.\" It declined to comment on whether it would consider pushing the date back again.</p><p>One question then is: How long will the rally continue? Though Bed Bath &amp; Beyond share price is nowhere near the peak reached in late January, it is still 37% above where it was when the company initiated the second buyback. With short interest still around 60%, another retail investor-fueled rally isn't out of the question. Theoretically, because a stock price can rise indefinitely, the loss that a company could incur from its ASR-induced short exposure is also potentially immense.</p><p>That leads to a second question: Can companies keep pushing back maturity dates? There is no definite answer here, but companies will generally try to avoid tinkering too much with an already-announced ASR to avoid any appearance of market manipulation or insider trading, according to a securities-focused lawyer.</p><p>It isn't so much that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's buyback method is particularly unique. In a particularly active year such as 2018, more than 70 such deals were announced with a combined value of $74 billion, according to data from Calcbench. The recent trading frenzy, however, highlights the risks that come with such buybacks. ASRs have had their moments of popularity for various reasons: Unlike regular share buybacks, an ASR immediately takes shares off the market and can provide a quick boost to earnings per share numbers. It can also be a way of showing investors that a company is serious about its buyback plan.</p><p>But there are examples of this strategy that backfired. In 2004, for example, Dallas energy firm TXU Corp. -- which has since gone private -- used an ASR deal to buy back $3.4 billion of the company's shares, resulting in a boost to its fourth-quarter results that year. TXU's share price rose, requiring the company to cough up $523 million during the first half of 2005. The added costs resulted in a per-share loss in the first quarter of 2005.</p><p>Of course, companies' share prices take off for all sorts of reasons -- always a risk for companies embarking on ASRs. The difference today is the sheer magnitude and randomness of the price rallies that social media has made possible in a compressed time frame. Last week, the rally targeted heavily shorted stocks; this week, it was silver. Who knows what it will be next week or for how long the rally will last?</p><p>Companies that believe their shares are undervalued need to play the buyback game carefully.</p>",
