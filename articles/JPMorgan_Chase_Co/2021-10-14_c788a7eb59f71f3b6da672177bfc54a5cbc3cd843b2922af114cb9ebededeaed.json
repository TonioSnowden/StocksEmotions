  "text": "<p>Citigroup and Morgan Stanley both benefited from a surge in dealmaking that bolstered revenues in the third quarter and helped offset continued pressure from low interest rates and weak loan demand.</p> <p>In third-quarter earnings on Thursday, Morgan Stanley posted investment bank revenues of $2.85bn, up 67 per cent from $1.7bn a year earlier and well ahead of analysts' forecasts for $1.9bn, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>The outperformance relative to analysts' estimates came from far better than expected fees from advisory work on mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>Rival JPMorgan Chase <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5fa2ba2-1fdf-4a55-a500-fdb0e7cba8e6\">in earnings on Wednesday</a> reported a 52 per cent rise in investment banking fees that totalled $3.3bn.</p> <p>Investment banks are raking in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a67e0300-98a8-4e29-890a-0949135933ba\">record</a> sums from fees thanks to a rush of dealmaking, compensating for a drop in trading revenue that surged in the first year of the pandemic amid extreme market volatility. </p> <p>“The investment banking side, the lens I have right now is in the fourth quarter and I think that the fourth quarter remains strong with clients active,”&#xa0;Sharon Yeshaya, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, told the Financial Times. </p> <p>Wall Street had forecast a 2 per cent decline in revenue across Citi's business lines as fees from fixed income trading normalised after reaching <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commodities-citigroup/citi-commodity-business-hits-record-in-first-quarter-on-volatile-markets-idUSKBN2440AI\">record highs</a> at the height of the pandemic.</p> <p>Investment banking fees have stepped in to pick up the slack, jumping 39 per cent, as markets revenue dropped 4 per cent. </p> <p>Citi said group-wide revenue rose 3 per cent excluding the impact of a loss from the sale of the bank's consumer business in Australia. Including that impact, revenue dropped 1 per cent to $17.2bn.</p> <p>At Bank of America, which also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d15ca00a-1883-4bcd-90a3-739f25c7db49\">reported</a> earnings on Thursday, investment banking fees rose 23 per cent to $2.2bn, helping it achieve overall <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d15ca00a-1883-4bcd-90a3-739f25c7db49\">double-digit revenue growth</a>. </p> <p>Heightened activity among Citi's institutional clients also offset declines in its global consumer business, where revenue dropped 13 per cent owing to almost non-existent loan demand.</p> <p>Costs rose 5 per cent as the company continued investing it in operations to satisfy a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84c831fb-5088-41cd-bcb6-0f0daf968c43\">regulatory consent order</a>. </p> <p>Citi told investors costs for the year would now be higher than initially planned on the back of planned investments by the bank. Expenses had emerged as a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73a669c7-a65d-4993-a5d8-f52e019f71d7\">“wild card”</a>&#xa0;for bank earnings this quarter,</p> <p>Overall, Citi reported net income of $4.6bn, or $2.15 per share, compared with earnings of $3.1bn, or $1.36 per share, in the third quarter of 2020.</p> <p>Though fixed income trading fell across the board, it was not as bad as&#xa0;the 20 per cent declines projected by analysts such as Coalition Greenwich. </p> <p>Citi reported a 16 per cent decline in fixed income trading fees, while Morgan Stanley reported a 16 per cent drop and BofA's earnings here declined less than 1 per cent. </p> <p>“We were too&#xa0;conservative,” Credit Suisse analyst&#xa0;Susan Katzke acknowledged&#xa0;in a note to clients after initial earnings results.</p> <p>More recent swings in oil markets helped slow some of the decline Wall Street had been bracing for. </p> <p>“Volatility towards the end of the year certainly did create opportunities for us to trade with investor clients and other clients who were repositioning,” Citi CFO Mark Mason told reporters.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley reported overall group revenue of $14.7bn, up from $11.7bn a year earlier and beating analysts' consensus for $13.7bn. Year-on-year revenue comparisons were flattered by the integration of Morgan Stanley's recent purchases of ETrade and Eaton Vance. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley's total net income of $3.5bn was up from $2.6bn a year earlier and also ahead of forecasts for $3bn.</p> <p>By midday in New York, Morgan Stanley shares were up 1.5 per cent. Citi shares were flat and BofA had climbed 2.9 per cent.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise in New York 2021 'Citi and Morgan Stanley ride dealmaking wave lifting Wall Street' FT.com 14 October.
