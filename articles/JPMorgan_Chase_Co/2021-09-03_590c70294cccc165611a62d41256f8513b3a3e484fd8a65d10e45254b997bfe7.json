  "text": "<p>Mostly I feel sorry for the chief executives. They asked everyone to come back to the office, and almost the only ones who obeyed were Extinction Rebellion activists. </p> <p>The climate protesters returned to London this week, pouring red paint over the entrance to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/damiengayle/status/1431226120985321472\">Standard Chartered</a> and smashing glass doors at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1433088507011010564?s=20\">JPMorgan</a>. Surely non-violent protest is one engagement that even Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, would prefer to do on Zoom.</p> <p>Extinction Rebellion — XR, for short — also had some counterintuitive targets. A youth group occupied the World Wildlife Fund, accusing some of its African and Asian conservation projects of harming local people. This seems misguided. First, pandas always win PR battles. Second, even outlaws need to build coalitions. Did Robin Hood hold up Friar Tuck and redistribute his good food and wine?</p> <p>In 2019, XR activists delayed a (low-carbon) Tube train. The year before, they stormed the offices of notorious climate villains Greenpeace. They told Greenpeace that they weren't radical enough, which must have surprised the activist who had spent two months in a Russian jail for storming an Arctic oil rig.</p> <p>All this has led to murmurs that XR is damaging the climate cause — too annoying, too divisive. I get this argument. Last weekend, an activist wanted to give my daughter a cloth patch with a skull logo, until I objected that I'm trying to safeguard her from the concept of human extinction until Year 1.</p> <p>But if XR is backfiring, there isn't much evidence of it. When it was founded in 2018, neither the Tories nor Labour were committed to net zero. “XR were vital in giving space for net zero 2050 to seem a credible position,” says Tim Lord, senior fellow at the Tony Blair Institute. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/public-concern-about-climate-change-and-pollution-doubles-near-record-level\">survey</a> of UK voters' concerns, the environment came second only to coronavirus. It's<a href=\"https://institute.global/policy/polls-apart-mapping-politics-net-zero\"> not just young urbanites</a>: concern is similar among young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban. The UK has banned new petrol cars after 2030 (the same policy as the German Green party). Still it needs to do <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fc8178e-fda9-41e3-b0f3-a9dd002e7f8b\">lots more</a>.</p> <p>XR's ability to mobilise thousands of people for the cause is impressive. Most of the activists I have met are warm and informed. When I hear critics mocking XR as scruffy work-dodgers, I think: what have you achieved for the climate? When they say that XR is alarmist, I think: hasn't climate alarmism proved a lot more accurate than climate scepticism? Yes, a few XR activists do silly dancing, but overall XR aren't the idiots here.</p> <p>Only 26 per cent of people <a href=\"https://www.centrefortowns.org/reports/reports/public-opinion-on-the-environment\">trust</a> what Extinction Rebellion has to say about the environment, compared to almost 90 per cent who trust David Attenborough. But social change isn't just about popularity. You can switch off Attenborough at 10pm on a Sunday night. XR keeps climate at the top of the agenda.</p> <p>Perhaps XR's role is like that played by the UK Independence party in Brexit — essential to get things going, not sufficient to win by itself. Other groups and politicians have to pick up the message and reach parts of the country that XR cannot. If you disagree with XR, maybe donate to someone you think is better.</p> <p>XR itself should probably focus. Its plan has been to keep building outrage, getting more and more people arrested, until the government falls. This seems unlikely. Its activism could be narrowed to shaming fossil fuel companies relentlessly, and to highlighting the government's most indefensible projects, such as airport expansions and new oil wells. That might produce more short-term wins.</p> <p>XR will always be annoying. So is the repeated beeping of my smoke alarm when its battery is flat. That's the point. It means I change the battery, and hopefully makes sure my home doesn't burn down. On balance, I'm glad it's there.</p> <p><em>henry.mance@ft.com</em> </p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0ac7aec-587b-40d4-a064-c1f9b0f23bcf\"><em>Extinction Rebellion's job is to get ‘activists' elected / From Barbara Mullarney, London W3, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Henry Mance 2021 'Extinction Rebellion may be annoying but it has a vital function' FT.com 3 September.
