JPM leading the way for the banking sector. Investors will now be eager to see just how much rising prices have impacted corporate profitability.</p><p>As of Friday, companies in the S&amp;P 500 index were expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 5.7% for the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv, which would be the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2020 during the pandemic.

Excluding energy, earnings are expected to contract by 3%, the data show. Full-year earnings are expected to see a rise of 9.4% but 3.8% excluding energy.</p><p>Read: Will earnings season trigger another leg lower for the Dow? Investors hunt for recession clues See also: Wall Street profit expectations for megabanks have cooled ahead of earnings amid a deep freeze in stocks</p><p>A team of strategists led by Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said that \"this is a very important season (aren't they all) as the collapse in equities so far in 2022 is largely due to margin compression [costs rise for companies that can't pass onto consumers] and not really earnings weakness.\"</p><p>Need to Know: If this stock market is shaping up like 2008, here's where we could be headed next, says strategist</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Twitter Inc.

UBER lobbied political leaders to relax labor and taxi laws, used a \"kill switch\" to thwart regulators and law enforcement, channeled money through Bermuda and other tax havens, and considered portraying violence against its drivers as a way to gain public sympathy as the company aggressively pushed into global markets. In a statement, Uber acknowledged \"mistakes\" in the past and said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, hired in 2017, had been \"tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates.\" Uber shares fell 4.5%.</p><p>* Moderna Inc. MRNA said Monday that a bivalent COVID-19 boosterthat equally protects against BA.1 and the original strain of the virus produced a better antibody response against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants in people who were fully vaccinated and boosted than its currently authorized COVID-19 booster.
