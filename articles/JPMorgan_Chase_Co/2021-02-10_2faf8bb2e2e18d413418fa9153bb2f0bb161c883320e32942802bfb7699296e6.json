  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats are pushing to include an increase in the federal minimum wage in their Covid-19 relief package, despite reservations from some in the party and other potential hurdles. </p><p>   House Democrats this week unveiled a coronavirus relief package that included a provision to raise the federal minimum wage over time to $15 an hour, up from its current level of $7.25. In the Senate, however, procedural rules for passing legislation without GOP support raise complications for Democrats hoping to quickly move a minimum-wage increase, and at least one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has said he opposes the change. </p><p>   Mr. Schumer indicated Tuesday that he was still hoping to pass it in the Senate. \"We're trying to work as well as we can with the parliamentarian to get minimum wage to happen, that's all I'm going to say,\" the New York Democrat said. </p><p>   Both the House and Senate last week passed a budget outline, opening up a process known as reconciliation that would allow them to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required for most legislation. </p><p>   Democratic leaders have said they hope to secure some GOP support, but they are making plans to pass the legislation without it. Still, they can't afford to lose any Democratic votes in the evenly divided Senate. </p><p>   Not all bills can be passed using reconciliation. Senate rules require that measures passed under it must have budgetary effects that aren't merely incidental to the policy aims. It isn't clear that raising the minimum wage will be considered permissible. The nonpartisan parliamentarian of the Senate determines which measures are eligible to pass under reconciliation. </p><p>   Democrats have said the increase is necessary to lift low-wage workers out of poverty and deliver pay increases to many essential employees during the pandemic. Republicans and some businesses and economists have warned that such an increase could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs. </p><p>   \"To take a bill and put policy positions in it that have absolutely nothing to do with Covid relief, in fact make it worse for many Americans because they will lose jobs, is really irresponsible,\" said Rep. Fred Keller (R., Pa.), the top Republican on the House Education and Workforce Committee's panel on workforce protections. </p><p>   Mr. Biden said last week in an interview with CBS News that he thought the Senate's parliamentary rules would prevent Democrats from including a rise in the minimum wage in the relief package. </p><p>   As part of his strategy to build public support for his coronavirus relief proposal, Mr. Biden met Tuesday afternoon with leaders from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Walmart Inc., Gap Inc. and Lowe's Cos., as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Business groups have been supportive of aid and higher wages but some, including the Business Roundtable and the Chamber, have objected to an across-the-board $15 minimum wage, saying pay should reflect where people live. </p><p>   On Monday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 could deliver raises for 27 million workers and lift 900,000 Americans above the poverty threshold, but it could cost 1.4 million Americans their jobs over the next four years. </p><p>   The study found the cumulative federal budget deficit from 2021 to 2031 would increase by $54 billion if a $15 federal minimum was enacted largely because higher prices for goods and services would contribute to an increase in federal spending. That impact is small relative to the last fiscal year's $3.1 trillion deficit. </p><p>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) said the CBO report indicated that raising the minimum wage had enough of a budgetary impact to be permitted under the Senate's rules. </p><p>   Republicans have criticized Democrats for quickly preparing to pass legislation without GOP support rather than taking more time for bipartisan negotiations and assessing the impact of the roughly $4 trillion Congress already has approved for coronavirus relief. </p><p>   Mr. Biden has met with Senate Republicans, but Democratic leaders have said they don't want bipartisan negotiations to bog down the process of passing additional relief before unemployment benefits expire in mid-March. </p><p></p>",
