  "title": "U.K. Inflation Hits Fresh Three-Decade High, Squeezing Household Budgets; With home energy costs set to jump, country faces sharpest drop in real spending power since mid-1950s",
  "text": "<p>Inflation had been rising in the U.S. and Europe due to supply-chain constraints, and accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine made energy and food more expensive. High inflation is forcing central banks to tighten monetary policy just as business and consumer confidence decline, threatening the post-Covid recovery across the West.</p><p>The U.S. Labor Department said Tuesday that the annual rate of inflation in the world's largest economy rose to 8.5% in March, its highest level since 1981.</p><p>The U.K.'s annual inflation rate is likely to rise further this month as home energy costs surge following a twice-yearly change to the ceiling on the prices that suppliers can charge.</p><p>Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan, expects the April inflation rate to mark a peak for this year at just under 9%, driven by already announced rises in home energy prices of 54%. He forecasts a further 30% rise in home energy prices in October, which will keep inflation high toward the end of this year.</p><p>\"Consumer confidence has fallen significantly in recent months, as worries around personal finances rise,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the industry association for U.K. stores. \"Households face a plethora of rising costs, with higher inflation to come as the increase in the energy price cap pushes up April's figures.\"</p><p>The ONS said the acceleration in inflation during March was largely driven by gasoline prices, which rose at the fastest pace on record.</p><p>Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Bank of England said it expected the inflation rate to rise to around 8% in the three months through June. The central bank has raised its key interest rate in each of its last three policy meetings, and is expected to do so again in May.</p><p>As in other parts of Europe, the pickup in inflation isn't being matched by wage rises. According to the ONS, real wages excluding bonuses were 1% lower in the three months through February than in the comparable period a year earlier, and that squeeze on spending power is likely to tighten.</p><p>In late March, the Office for Budget Responsibility—the official budget watchdog—estimated that real household disposable income per person would fall by 2.2% in the fiscal year running through early April 2023. That would be the largest decline since records began, in the fiscal year to April 1957.</p><p>According to the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on people with low incomes, the poorest 25% of households will see the largest loss of spending power. That is because energy and fuel bills account for a bigger share of their budgets than they do for richer households.</p><p>The ONS estimates that for the poorest 10% of households, food and energy bills account for a third of their income, while for the richest 10%, they account for less than one-tenth.</p><p>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Inflation Hits Fresh Three-Decade High, Squeezing Household Budgets</p>",
