  "title": "Business News: Port Labor Talks Hold Risk of Supply-Chain Complications",
  "text": "<p>The risks have seldom been as high as they are this year.</p><p>Bargaining between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and cargo-handling companies is set to begin Tuesday, two years into a supply-chain crunch brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic that has strained factory production, hobbled retail sales and helped push inflation to a 40-year high.</p><p>The sides are scheduled to meet in San Francisco as U.S. ports are clearing a backlog of container ships and shipping rates that have reached record levels appear to be stabilizing. But shipping officials say freight networks remain fragile, since the talks might be heating up just as a new rush of imports is due to hit the ports this summer at the start of the peak shipping season.</p><p>\"If anything further disrupts the supply chain it will be devastating,\" said Jim McKenna, head of the Pacific Maritime Association, who will lead labor talks on behalf of employers including some of the world's largest ocean shipping lines.</p><p>ILWU International President Willie Adams wrote in an open letter dated Friday that the union seeks \"a contract that honors, respects, and protects good American jobs and U.S. importers and exporters.\"</p><p>Importers of everything from furniture to toys and U.S. exporters of agricultural goods and other products are bracing for potential fallout; 40% of U.S. seaborne imports flow through the 29 ports affected by the talks, and past talks have led to severe disruptions.</p><p>Dockworkers are expected to demand higher wages, better benefits and limits to the automation of cargo-handling facilities. Industry officials and observers say the union enters the negotiations in a stronger position than usual.</p><p>The union's workers kept operations running throughout the pandemic and handled record cargo volumes. The foreign-based ocean carriers, which own many of the ports' cargo-handling facilities, can't plead poverty after reaping billions of dollars in profits in a market in which supply continues to outstrip demand. The White House, which has the authority to intervene if talks reach an impasse, is viewed as friendly to labor.</p><p>Few industry officials expect talks to be resolved by the time the current contract expires July 1. But there is optimism an agreement can be reached by year end.</p><p>During previous talks, the federal government began paying close attention after negotiations had proceeded for months, industry officials say. In contrast, notes Brian Ossenbeck, a senior analyst covering transportation and logistics at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the Biden administration has focused on ports for more than a year, pushing logistics firms and shippers to change operations to ease congestion.</p><p>Shipping customers have become so used to dealing with port congestion during the past two years that many have adopted mitigation strategies, from holding more inventory to bringing in goods through other ports.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
