Bank of America was expected to earn 75 cents a share on revenue of $22.7 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.</p><p>\"We believe our earnings generation over the next 18 months will provide ample capital to support growth, pay dividends, buy back shares and continue to invest in our people, platforms and communities as we grow into new regulatory capital level requirements,\" said Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick.
