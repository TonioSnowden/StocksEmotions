  "title": "EY Plan To Split Sets Up A Partner Windfall --- Proposal to divide auditing, consulting units relies on optimistic forecasts",
  "text": "<p>The internal documents show that Ernst &amp; Young believes both firms could grow faster and be more profitable on their own. The breakup of the 312,000-person firm could happen as soon as late next year.</p><p>This account of EY's plan, code-named Project Everest, is based on internal documents distributed to top EY executives in May and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, as well as people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Under a May version of the internal proposal, the consulting business would go public, hoping to sell a stake of around 15% of the company for more than $10 billion, while borrowing $17 billion, the people said. The current partners would own around 70% of the company with around 15% reserved for stock awards mostly for staff.</p><p>Much of the money raised in the IPO and borrowed by the consulting firm would go to pay off the firm's auditing partners, who would remain in the traditional but slower-growing business of examining and signing off on companies' financial statements.</p><p>Those partners would receive a cash payout of typically two to four times their annual pay under the plan. For the U.S. and U.K. partners, who earn on average around $850,000 to $900,000 a year, that is a typical windfall of some $2 million or more. The firm's most senior partners would likely get far more.</p><p>The partners joining the consulting business would get shares in the newly public company worth typically seven times to nine times their annual compensation, paid out over five years. That business would compete with major consulting firms ranging from International Business Machines Corp. to Accenture PLC, plus the other accounting firms that have built up their own consulting operations.</p><p>Earlier proposals for the deal had the senior partners getting much bigger multiples of their pay as windfalls, compared with more junior partners. The size of the senior partners' windfall has been reduced as the plan has evolved. The value of the average expected payout for EY's roughly 13,000 partners has been scaled back because of the market decline since the numbers were presented in May.</p><p>EY's decision to consider a breakup comes as regulators step up pressure on auditing firms to address conflicts of interest in their business. Regulators in many countries are concerned that the consulting services the firms sell could undermine their ability to conduct independent audits of public companies' financials. Auditors are paid by the companies they audit and must adhere to strict rules that limit whom they can sell consulting services to.</p><p>EY is facing investigations and lawsuits tied to a string of alleged frauds and failures of its audit clients. It has lost big clients due to its struggles, which led its top executive to break with industry tradition and say auditors should play a bigger role in detecting wrongdoing.</p><p>EY has defended the quality of its audits and said these problems didn't affect its decision on a breakup.</p><p>Project Everest began in November, when Carmine Di Sibio, EY's global chairman and chief executive, decided to reopen discussions about splitting the company. It was a reversal from his NextWave strategy to grow the firm as a whole.</p><p>\"We need to be decisive . . . to control the destiny of our businesses, and not have it defined for us by external forces,\" the firm said in an internal EY document.</p><p>Project Everest gathered momentum in February, when EY appointed bankers from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., as well as outside law firms, to advise on the deal. By May, an initial feasibility study had come down in favor of an IPO.</p><p>\"Our businesses are strong but there are obstacles holding us back from achieving our full potential,\" one EY document said. The disadvantages of the firm's current structure include \"limited growth in both [audit and nonaudit arms] due to independence restrictions,\" the document said.</p><p>On May 17 and 18, Mr. Di Sibio and other senior global EY executives met in London to discuss the deal with the heads of several leading EY member firms and bankers from Goldman and JPMorgan.</p><p>After news of the potential split leaked last month, EY began scrambling to pull together a public statement of its formal plans. The firm aims to issue a \"go or no go\" decision in principle before the July 4 holiday.</p><p>Assuming EY decides to push ahead with the plan, it will need to convince partners in most of the roughly 140 countries that make up its global network. The firm's top executives will hold roadshows this summer to pitch the deal with votes planned for between this fall and January 2023. A split and IPO is penciled in for late next year, later than the original target date of June 2023.</p><p>The exact contours of that deal are still being worked out by EY's leadership. As the plan stood in late April, the new consulting firm would get about 60% of EY's projected $42.5 billion in revenue for the current financial year, with about 40% going to the mostly audit partnership.</p><p>Under the planning, the mostly audit firm is called AssureCo, while the consulting arm is called NewCo. AssureCo will likely keep the EY name.</p><p>EY believes both firms could perform better when they are free from regulatory restrictions. \"Now is the time to jump to new growth curves for both businesses,\" one internal EY document said.</p><p>The consultants, for example, can be restricted from making alliances with tech firms to sell compliance and other services. These multiyear outsourcing contracts are an important target market for consulting firms.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
