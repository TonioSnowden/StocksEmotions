  "text": "<p>Weaker trading and rising expenses have largely taken the shine out of fourth quarter US bank earnings reported so far. Shares in Goldman Sachs are down 10 per cent since the start of the year while JPMorgan has shed 7 per cent of its value.</p> <p>Yet two banks — Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — have emerged in a class of their own. Both have opted to focus on stodgier business and tighter cost controls. It is proving to be a winning formula on both Wall Street and Main Street. This is reflected in the banks' price to book valuation of 1.7 times (Morgan Stanley) and 1.5 times (BoA).&#xa0;</p> <p>Morgan Stanley is counting on the decidedly less glamorous parts of the bank, namely wealth management and investment management, to help it hit the ambitious new<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7c1961f-09c4-4109-8c25-89acb00264b9\"> financial target</a> of at least a 20 per cent return on tangible common equity laid out on Wednesday. Boss James Gorman has good reasons to be confident. </p> <p>The two units, which now boast $6.5tn in assets under management, have been steady earners throughout the pandemic. In the fourth quarter, they pulled in $8bn in revenue, an 18 per cent jump from the prior year period. The increase helped to offset a steep drop in bond trading. These two businesses now account for over half of overall group revenue.</p> <p>On Main Street, BoA has managed to outperform rival US lenders by putting more deposits to work in higher yielding debt securities rather than in cash or Treasuries. The strategy has helped the country's second-biggest lender to deliver a 11 per cent rise in net interest income of $11.4bn. This is despite tepid loan demand and low rates. The figure handily topped the 3 per cent increase reported by JPMorgan last week. </p> <p>Another benefit to reduced reliance on investment banking: fewer high-paying bankers on its payroll. </p> <p>Non-interest expenses at Morgan Stanley and BoA were 5 and 6 per cent higher respectively in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. That is a far smaller figure than the 11 per cent rise at JPMorgan and the 23 per cent increase at Goldman.</p> <p>Costs are expected to become a big focus for investors this year. Banks that can keep the lid on expenses will have a leg up on the competition. Morgan Stanley and BoA are showing how to do it.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Morgan Stanley/BoA: bucking the bank earning trends' FT.com 19 January.
