  "text": "<p>   But this apparent mastery was possible only because citizens had ceded to the state ultimate authority over the natural landscape. And like all previous technological \"conquests\" of water, this one is a mirage. What would happen, Mr. Boccaletti asks, if the illusion of control were shattered by floods, droughts, famines and massive migrations caused by changes in climate? \"The fractures that may appear,\" he argues, would \"test the robustness of society's adaptation. Catastrophes are a powerful source of political energy, which can easily lend themselves as much to the next step in nation-building as they can to oppression.\" And republics, he warns, as the inherently unstable mediators between individual rights and collective needs, may find themselves at particular risk in these disruptions. But whatever the next twist in the byzantine story of water and politics, one thing is certain: Its effects \"will travel not via the rivers and floodplains of the world, but through the institutions of human society.\" Just as they have since time immemorial. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Helferich's most recent book is \"An Unlikely Trust: Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan, and the Improbable Partnership That Reshaped American Business.\" </p><p></p>",
