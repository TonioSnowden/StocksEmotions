  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s fourth-quarter profit fell 14%, the bank said Friday.</p><p>The slowdown in the fourth quarter didn't stop the bank from setting a record for annual profit. The nation's biggest bank earned $48.3 billion in 2021, compared with the pre-pandemic high of $36.4 billion in 2019. The recovering economy, raucous markets and frantic merger volumes drove fees to new highs.</p><p>Also, JPMorgan last year freed $9 billion that it had set aside for pandemic loan defaults, which didn't materialize. In 2020 it had set aside $19 billion.</p><p>Fourth-quarter profit was $10.4 billion, or $3.33 a share, better than Wall Street's expectation for $3.01 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue was roughly flat at $29.3 billion, compared with the $29.8 billion analysts had expected. Full-year revenue also hit a record, rising 1% to $121.6 billion, with the investment bank, commercial bank and asset and wealth management division all notching their best years ever.</p><p>In the corporate and investment bank, fourth-quarter revenue rose 2% to $11.5 billion. Surging investment banking fees more than offset a slowdown from the boom in trading revenue.</p><p>Fourth-quarter revenue in the consumer bank fell 4% to $12.3 billion.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan's Quarterly Profit Drops 14%</p>",
