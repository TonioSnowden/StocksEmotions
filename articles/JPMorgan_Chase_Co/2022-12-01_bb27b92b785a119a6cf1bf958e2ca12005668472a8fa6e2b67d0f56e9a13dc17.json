  "title": "Deluge of Fraud Claims Adds to Concerns About Credit Scores; False claims of identity theft raise questions about how reliable the credit-reporting system really is",
  "text": "<p>That has smoothed the claims process for people who have fallen victim to identity theft. But the credit-reporting industry says it is also being hit by illegitimate claims, facilitated by companies that promise to help customers fix low credit scores for a fee. These companies file false identity-theft claims on items that bring down customer's credit scores, like delinquent credit-card debt, often without that person's knowledge.</p><p>The move often removes that information from the consumer's credit reports while the claim is investigated. The practice is known in the industry as credit washing, since a person's credit reports can look better than they really are, at least temporarily, and so can their scores.</p><p>Credit washing has slowed down the process of getting loans at some banks while lenders look for other ways to evaluate potential borrowers. It has added to questions about how useful credit scores really are and eroded banks' confidence in the credit-reporting system they have relied on for decades.</p><p>Equifax, Experian and TransUnion get millions of letters each year that allege errors on credit reports, many claiming identity theft, according to people familiar with the matter. It isn't known how many are illegitimate claims. Sometimes the companies receive batches of similar letters claiming identity theft or other issues at once—mailed from the same ZIP Code on the same date, some with the same typos, according to the people and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Banks have staffed up the teams that review claims about credit-report errors, and they are using additional data that aren't affected by credit washing to make lending decisions. Some say they have been flagging what they believe are fake claims of identity theft to law enforcement. Lenders including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Capital One Financial Corp., Ally Financial Inc., Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. and Synchrony Financial have all encountered the practice in recent years, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Naftali Harris, chief executive at SentiLink, a company that works with lenders to help stop identity fraud, said many lenders tell him that 80% to 90% of the claims they receive about identity theft are fraudulent. SentiLink said people who repeatedly claim that accurate information is erroneous account for 1 to 2 percentage points of what credit-card issuers write off as delinquent debt. That equated to between $200 million and $400 million in loan losses last year, SentiLink estimates.</p><p>In years past, when consumers wanted to claim an account on their credit reports had been fraudulently opened in their name, they often had little choice but to include a police report. Since 2016, Americans have been able to do so by filing a report at IdentityTheft.gov, a Federal Trade Commission website, and then sending it along with other documents to the credit-reporting firms.</p><p>Overall, U.S. consumers reported to the FTC roughly 588,000 cases of identity theft tied to credit cards, auto loans and other financing last year, including both legitimate and illegitimate claims, up from about 155,000 claims five years earlier. An FTC spokeswoman said a variety of reasons, including data breaches, new ways to commit identity theft and increased consumer awareness, have contributed to the rise.</p><p>When a person provides the required paperwork to Equifax, Experian or TransUnion stating that an unpaid loan or other negative information on a credit report is the result of identity theft, the companies in many cases must remove the information within four business days if they can't verify it is legitimate. They and the lenders can continue to look into the claim, and later reinstate the account if it's found to be legitimate. Meanwhile, the borrower is in a better position to apply for new loans from other lenders.</p><p>Some lenders say questionable identity-theft claims often arrive soon after people have maxed out their credit cards. Banks say that customers who realize they have fallen victim to identity theft generally call the bank in a panic. The people associated with the mailed-in letters often don't call.</p><p>While consumers can file false claims on their own, people in the industry say that unscrupulous credit-repair companies are a bigger portion of the problem.</p><p>For years, credit-repair companies have pitched themselves as holding the secret for improving bad credit scores, especially when the economy looks dour. Some say that their services can help people obtain affordable financing for a new car or to become homeowners, messages that resonate with consumers struggling to make ends meet. Customers can end up worse than they started, having paid hundreds or thousands of dollars with little effect on their credit scores.</p><p>Often, there is little that credit-repair companies can legitimately do that consumers can't do for themselves. Most negative information, like missed payments, stay on a person's credit reports for seven years. Federal law requires that credit-reporting firms investigate when consumers say there are errors on their reports, and correct or delete the information if the consumers are right.</p><p>Regulators, lawmakers and borrowers have long been critical of errors on credit reports and complained that it is difficult to get the credit-reporting firms to address them.</p><p>The FTC has sued several credit-repair companies in recent years.</p><p>Credit-repair company Turbo Solutions Inc. told people it could remove late payments, bankruptcies and other negative information from their credit reports, according to a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the FTC in federal court in Texas. Phone representatives for the company, which went by a few names, including Alex Miller Credit Repair, said that consumers' credit scores would improve by 200 points in 90 days, according to the lawsuit. Credit scores generally range from 300 to 850.</p><p>The company and its CEO, Alex Miller, collected more than $9 million from consumers since at least 2018, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the company and Mr. Miller broke federal rules by collecting fees before providing services and by making false or misleading statements to consumers. The complaint also alleges that they attempted to improve credit scores by filing false identity-theft reports.</p><p>Brian Ponder, a lawyer for Turbo Solutions and Mr. Miller, said his clients deny the government's allegations, which \"have not been adjudicated as facts.\" Mr. Ponder said he has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which is pending.</p><p>In March, a federal judge ordered Turbo Solutions to cease operating in ways that violate federal law. Social-media accounts associated with Mr. Miller continue to encourage people to sign up for his services.</p><p>Mr. Ponder said his client \"legally markets directly to the public via his social media accounts.\"</p><p>Other claims, beyond identity theft, are gumming up the system. Equifax, Experian and TransUnion have received letters stating only that one or more items on consumers' credit reports were inaccurate, according to the people familiar with the matter. The vagueness of the disputes can result in long investigations that can also result in accounts falling off people's credit reports, at least temporarily, and giving them a better overall credit standing.</p><p>Some 1,200 letters from consumers in California, Massachusetts and Virginia, all postmarked Feb. 24, 2021, and mailed from the same Pennsylvania ZIP Code, arrived at TransUnion with the same format, text and typos, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the Journal. They each stated that a consumer had reached a settlement \"to resolv\" a debt on an account, which should \"now be considred\" paid off.</p><p>When TransUnion receives a large number of nearly identical letters from different consumers, it sends follow-up letters to the consumers requesting confirmation if they are working with a credit-repair company, according to people familiar with the matter—and it has sent more than 1.75 million such letters so far this year.</p><p>On April 1, Equifax received thousands of letters with similar language indicative of credit washing, sent in some cases from more than 100 miles away from the consumer's home address, according to documents and people familiar with the matter. One letter reviewed by the Journal stated that more than a dozen accounts on a person's credit report, including credit cards, car loans and a bankruptcy, were the result of identity theft.</p><p>Credit reports and scores are an integral part of how banks decide who gets to borrow money and how much interest they pay. To Americans at the margins, their impact runs especially deep. A low credit score or negative marks on a credit report can lock a person out of buying a car, getting a mortgage, securing some job offers or renting an apartment.</p><p>In one glitch earlier this year, Equifax sent out inaccurate scores on millions of Americans, an error that left some potential borrowers with denied loans or higher interest rates, the Journal previously reported. An Equifax spokeswoman said that based on preliminary internal analysis, fewer than 300,000 consumers had a credit score shift of 25 points or more in either direction, with approximately 60% receiving a lower credit score.</p><p>The credit-reporting industry says it works hard to make sure that data on credit reports is reliable. A spokesman for the Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents Equifax, Experian, TransUnion and other credit-reporting firms, said that some credit-repair companies \"undermine the process of addressing legitimate requests.\"</p><p>The credit-repair sector says it helps customers fix erroneous reports and navigate a process that the three powerful credit-reporting firms often make complicated and time-consuming.</p><p>Credit-repair firms can also educate people on topics like how to manage their credit cards to improve their credit standing, said Donna Perkins, vice president of the industry group National Association of Credit Services Organizations.</p><p>\"Millions of consumers have been helped by our industry,\" she said. Ms. Perkins, whose group represents roughly 250 credit-repair firms, said bad actors filing false identity-theft claims are the exception. \"They are not the standard in the industry,\" she said.</p><p>One credit-repair firm, a Florida company called The Credit Game, allegedly offered credit-repair and other packages with titles like \"Maserati\" and \"Lambo,\" short for Lamborghini, according to a civil lawsuit filed this year in federal court in Florida by the FTC. </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has sued several credit-repair companies in recent years. PHOTO: Elizabeth Frantz for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The FTC alleged, among other things, that The Credit Game and affiliated companies advised people to file false reports of identity theft and that it filed such reports unbeknown to customers.</p><p>A lawyer for The Credit Game said the company disputes the FTC's allegations. \"In this type of case, the FTC has a great deal of power, including the power to freeze business and personal assets before there has been a trial adjudicating any wrongdoing,\" said the lawyer, Michael Freed. \"This makes it very hard for defendants in FTC cases to defend themselves fully.\"</p><p>The Credit Game is under the control of a court-appointed receiver, and currently isn't operating.</p><p>A company called DoNotPay, which describes itself as a consumer-rights robot lawyer, recently launched a service that generates letters for people who want Equifax, Experian and TransUnion to remove information from their credit reports. Identity theft is one type of claim that people can choose in their software-generated letters.</p><p>DoNotPay charges new customers $36 a quarter for a subscription that generates these letters, among other services, said Chief Executive Joshua Browder. He said his company found cases where credit-repair firms used the software to charge their customers much more. DoNotPay shut those companies off, said Mr. Browder, whose own firm is backed by venture investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund.</p><p>\"We're giving people fairness in a system stacked against them,\" Mr. Browder said. The credit-reporting system, he added, \"is a lot more in favor of creditors. It's a lot easier for a consumer to be in a mistaken situation than it is to commit fraud.\"</p><p>Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com</p><p>Deluge of Fraud Claims Adds to Concerns About Credit Scores</p>",
