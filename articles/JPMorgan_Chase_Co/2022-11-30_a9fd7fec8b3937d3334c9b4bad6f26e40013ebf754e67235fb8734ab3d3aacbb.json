  "title": "World News: Global Poor Lose Services As Debt Payments Increase",
  "text": "<p>The cuts are now hitting some of the world's poorest people at a time when many are reeling from economic shocks brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Aided by ultralow interest rates in the West and Chinese loans, emerging and developing economies over the past decade ran up record levels of government debt, which the International Monetary Fund expects to reach 64.5% of gross domestic product at the end of 2022. In 2008, government debt in the same economies was valued at just 33.6% of GDP.</p><p>Servicing the debt has become much more costly, as local currencies have lost value against the dollar and governments are facing high bills for food and fuel imports, which many governments subsidize for their citizens.</p><p>High interest rates also make it harder to roll over bonds when they come due, forcing governments with approaching payment deadlines to make cuts or raise taxes for money to pay not only the interest on what they owe, but also the principal.</p><p>The bonds of around a third of the 69 countries in JPMorgan's Emerging Market Bond Index now trade with yields of more than 10%, a rate at which most governments would struggle to issue new bonds. New dollar-denominated bond sales by low- and lower-middle-income governments for the first nine months of 2022 were down 70% from last year.</p><p>About 60% of lower-income countries have either defaulted or are at high risk of defaulting on their debts, the IMF says.</p><p>\"I cannot find an example in history when so many malevolent forces have come together at the same time,\" Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said in an address to the nation in October, days after the World Bank projected that the West African country's debt would surpass 104% of GDP by the end of the year.</p><p>\"The basic problem we face is that we are not making as much money as we need to spend, and what little money we do make is going to pay for the debts,\" Mr. Akufo-Addo said.</p><p>Most economists believe that risks to the global financial system from the run-up in developing-country debt are limited, since many of the worst-affected countries have small economies. Signals from the Fed that it is slowing the pace of its interest-rate increases and some recent easing in the dollar's strength have somewhat alleviated the pressure.</p><p>Still, debt problems are likely to weigh on many developing countries for a long time, while disproportionately hurting some of the world's poorest people.</p><p>A recent analysis by the United Nations Development Program found that the 54 developing countries it identified with severe debt problems account for just over 3% of global GDP, but more than half of the 600 million people living in extreme poverty globally.</p><p>One result, World Bank officials say, is that the global goal of ending extreme poverty by the end of the decade is now effectively out of reach.</p><p>Many countries now spend far more on debt servicing than health, education and other core services.</p><p>In Ghana, total debt service reached 129% of revenue in 2020, the IMF said, as the country borrowed to pay interest on its existing loans and bonds. That came to an end when interest rates shot up this year and sparked a selloff in Ghana's currency, which is down more than 50% against the dollar this year.</p><p>Ghana's finance minister on Friday said the country's debt was unsustainable and that the government would seek to exchange current bonds for new ones with better terms, taking a first step toward a debt restructuring.</p>",
