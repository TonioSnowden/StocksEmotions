  "text": "<p>Law firm Linklaters is set to elect a female senior partner for the first time in its 183-year history, in the latest example of more women breaking into the top ranks of commercial law.&#xa0;</p> <p>Linklaters, one of the City's “magic circle” firms, is about to conclude elections to replace outgoing senior partner and deals lawyer, Charlie Jacobs, with three women in the running.&#xa0;</p> <p>The candidates are global corporate head Aedamar Comiskey — tipped as the frontrunner by two insiders — London corporate and M&amp;A partner Sarah Wiggins; and Milan-based western Europe managing partner, Claudia Parzani. Corporate partner Tom Shropshire was an early candidate but left the firm last week to become general counsel at Diageo.</p> <p>The all-female shortlist is unusual for a City law firm but follows other recent examples of women breaking into top jobs in the historically fusty legal sector.</p> <p>These include 45-year-old Georgia Dawson, who was elected head of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in September, and corporate lawyer Rebecca Maslen-Stannage, who was named Herbert Smith Freehills' new senior partner in March.&#xa0;</p> <p>One Linklaters insider called the election of a female leader a “historic” moment. “These are all seasoned operators in their own right but this will be meaningful,” she said. “A lot of young women will draw inspiration from this.”</p> <p>Insiders said changing the firm's remuneration system was at the top of the agenda during the election campaign, which comes at a crucial point for the firm. Linklaters has come under increased pressure from highly-profitable US rivals seeking to poach its best talent, and has struggled to crack the US market, the world's largest and most lucrative.&#xa0;</p> <p>Several firms have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c27f14e0-03f6-4c5c-9988-0cc8dac93016\">forced to abandon “lockstep”</a> remuneration models, which tie pay to time served, to compete with pay offers from US firms, including Linklaters' rival Allen &amp; Overy.&#xa0;</p> <p>One Linklaters partner said: “[The pay structure] needs to change. We need to be able to compete for talent in a way we currently can't.”</p> <p>But he added: “It's something people have really strong feelings around and it's very difficult to get people to change their view.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Linklaters' new senior partner will replace Jacobs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02260413-526e-45d4-a44e-082fb6cb5979\">when he leaves</a> to join JPMorgan as co-head of investment banking later this year. The South African lawyer is among the City's top advisers and will depart from Linklaters after more than three decades.&#xa0;</p> <p>Linklaters will kick off elections to replace current managing partner Gideon Moore next year. The banking partner won a second term in 2019 for three years and will step down in April 2022. </p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Kate Beioley in London  2021 'Linklaters on brink of electing first female senior partner  ' FT.com 5 May.
