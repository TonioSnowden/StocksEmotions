  "text": "<p>When Harbour Energy shares start trading on Thursday after the completion this week of its merger of Chrysaor with Premier Oil, the private equity-backed company will become the biggest independent oil and gas producer to be listed in London since BG Group. </p> <p>It will also be the biggest oil and gas producer in the UK North Sea, providing an important test of investor appetite at a time when ESG — environmental, social and governance — has become a watchword for fund managers. </p> <p>For Linda Cook, the former Royal Dutch Shell executive who has helped build the company, Harbour's public debut on Thursday utilising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5289be40-7a45-4598-b16b-8357775aa6dc\">Premier's old listing</a> will fill a gap in the London market.</p> <p>“What was missing when investors want to get exposure to oil and gas producers was the type of company we used to have: high-quality independents with an international focus,” Cook said, comparing Harbour to companies bought out in recent years such as Anadarko, Noble Energy and BG Group. </p> <p>“The remaining ones are almost exclusively focused on onshore US, so we want to offer something different for those who want an independent offshore oil and gas producer who can operate at scale.”</p> <p>The combined company will come to market with about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in production — far less than a company such as Shell at 2.7m boepd but much more than most other independent oil and gas producers listed in London.</p> <p>It is expected to have an initial market capitalisation of about £4.4bn, which may allow it to enter the FTSE 100 in September. </p> <p>The strategy will not be to expand in the North Sea but to invest enough to offset decline rates, keeping production “relatively flat over time”, Cook said.</p> <p>“By doing that we will continue to generate additional free cash flow that we can then use to look for growth in other parts of the world.”</p> <p>James Hosie, analyst at Barclays, forecasted Harbour could generate more than $1.1bn in free cash flow in 2022 if <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d6caaf7-d00a-4a2f-a5e9-877dabf09d39\">oil prices</a> stay around $60 a barrel, enough to pay a dividend he estimates at about $240m, implying a 4 per cent yield.</p> <p>Harbour might be considered old school in its offshore focus but it is not seen as an old-fashioned oil company. In many ways it represents a wave of change that has washed over the North Sea in the past six years since the $100-oil era came to an end.</p> <p>As energy majors scaled back in a basin they broadly viewed as having its best days behind it, private equity-backed companies such as Chrysaor — which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d618868-307d-4660-9acd-a52d8281ba86\">combining with Premier to form Harbour</a> — swept in to grab assets they saw could still have strong cash flows if operating costs were kept down.</p> <p>The company's $3bn deal for a chunk of Shell's North Sea assets in 2017, which at the time produced 120,000 boepd, kickstarted the handover.</p> <p>Harbour's Premier deal last year, when Premier was struggling to manage its debt load amid low oil prices, gave the company a ready-made route to a public listing alongside more than 60,000 boepd of additional production.</p> <p>Premier's creditors will have 18 per cent of the shares while its old shareholders will hold 5 per cent. The largest shareholder will be EIG Global Energy Partners — Harbour's private equity backers — with 36 per cent.</p> <p>Harbour's debut comes at an interesting time. While environmental concerns and expectations of a looming peak in oil demand have only risen in the past year, banks such as JPMorgan are forecasting the industry could be set for one last hurrah.</p> <p>They argue that oil prices will rise because investment has fallen too fast in new production, while demand is still growing in emerging markets. Since October, when Harbour and Premier first agreed their deal, oil has risen from about $40 a barrel to $65.</p> <p>Cook says part of the plan is to snap up assets the oil majors are offloading as they streamline their portfolios and increase focus on renewable energy.</p> <p>Harbour also has a foothold in the UK's green energy plans through a stake in the Acorn carbon capture and hydrogen project in the north-east of Scotland and the Humber Zero project.</p> <p>“We do have a focus on ESG and we have made a commitment to be net zero by 2035, we take that very seriously,” Cook said. </p> <p>But while the company tries to thread the needle between growth and environmental concerns, its core focus will almost certainly be cash flow.</p> <p>“If we find new assets then great,” Cook said. “If we don't then I'm sure that shareholders will be more than happy to take the money we'll generate off our hands.”</p><p>Source: David Sheppard, Energy Editor 2021 'A new Harbour in oil's storm?'
