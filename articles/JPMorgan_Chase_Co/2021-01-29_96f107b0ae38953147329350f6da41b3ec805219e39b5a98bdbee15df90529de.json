  "text": "<p>The nation is reading more during lockdown. Good news for <strong>Bloomsbury Publishing</strong>.</p> <p>The publishing house said profit will be well ahead of market expectations for the year ending February as adult and children's books both delivered better than expected sales. </p> <p>Bloomsbury highlighted demand for new titles including <em>Joe Biden</em>:&#xa0;<em>American Dreamer</em>&#xa0;by Evan Osnos and <em>Humankind: A Hopeful History </em>by Dutch historian&#xa0;Rutger Bregman alongside the strength of a back catalogue that includes the Harry Potter series. Industry data suggest print books sold in the UK during 2020 grew year on year by 5.2 per cent, the company said.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Boohoo</strong> confirmed it is in talks with the administrators of Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire to buy the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands. Sky News had <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/boohoo-renews-high-street-raid-to-complete-arcadia-break-up-12201642\">reported </a>on Thursday that the three brands could cost Boohoo around £25m.</p> <p><strong>Polymetal</strong>, the FTSE 100 listed Russian gold miner, said 2020 revenue jumped 28 per cent to $2.9bn on a 4 per cent increase in bullion production. The company said costs would be lower than previously guided as sharp devaluations for the rouble and Kazakhstani Tenge outweighed Covid-related costs.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Dr Martens</strong> set a flotation price of 370p per share, which values the bootmaker at £3.7bn ahead of Friday's market debut. </p> <p><strong>Avon Rubber</strong> said recent trading has remained as flagged in a December warning, which was caused by delays to a military contract. The safety mask maker reported continued good order intake across the portfolio and said it remains confident of achieving its expectations for the current financial year ending September.</p> <p><strong>Card Factory</strong> said it has secured temporary waivers from its banking syndicate to avoid an imminent breach of loan covenants. The retailer, which had warned a fortnight ago that it was likely to fail the January debt test, said lenders had offered an extra month and remain “in constructive discussions” over a longer term solution. </p> <p><strong>CVS</strong>, the veterinary services group, reported sales up 9.4 per cent to £245.6m on strengthened profit margins for the six months to December. “The veterinary market continues to benefit from favourable consumer trends, with increasing pet ownership and the humanisation of pets driving wider appreciation of animal care,” CVS said.</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Celtic</strong>'s Peter Lawwell has tendered his resignation after 18 years as chief executive of the Aim-quoted Scottish football club. Dominic McKay, current chief operating officer of Scottish Rugby Union, was named as his successor when Mr Lawwell steps down in June. </p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Robinhood</strong>, the online brokerage at the centre of wild trading in equities this week, prepared <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a1b24e6-0433-462a-a860-c2504ea565e4\">to restore trading in GameStop</a> and other hot stocks on Friday after tapping banks to shore up its financial position. The company has drawn down at least several hundred million dollars via a credit facility with banks led by JPMorgan and including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Wells Fargo, according to people familiar with the move. Futures contracts suggest equity markets in Europe and the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b047b27f-e495-44cf-a59a-c5580091aee4\">will fall on Friday</a> as retail trading platforms scramble to restore trading.</p> <p><strong>McKinsey</strong> is in advanced discussions with several US states' attorneys-general <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8441f057-de28-4f8d-8281-c054433ee0f5\">to pay hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to settle civil claims about its role in advising drug companies held responsible for the country's opioid epidemic.&#xa0;But two people familiar with the discussions said the agreement under negotiation would involve no admission of wrongdoing or liability on the consultancy's part.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>General Motors</strong> aims <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea49d8cc-0e40-4dcd-ab60-0decc7146f5a\">to stop selling petrol or diesel cars</a> by 2035, the first of the world's biggest carmakers to set a deadline for its final sales of passenger vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. As part of a plan to become carbon neutral by 2040, the Chevrolet and Buick owner said on Thursday it “aspires to eliminate tailpipe emissions” from its entire range of light-duty vehicles.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Gillian Tett</strong> <br>It is time for a linguistic rethink as the green bandwagon accelerates. We should not divide the world into binary buckets of “green” and “brown” but rather create a blend of greenish-brown or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37bb0b5-3362-497a-8df7-7c28b95d0cb4\">“olive”</a>, where companies turn their activities a lighter shade of green in a way that can be measured credibly.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Lombard</strong> <br>Fittingly for a drinks company, Diageo is not fretting about liquidity. Buybacks could even be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/def15c07-dc10-4324-8c27-83f53a907e99\">back on the table</a> next fiscal year.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
