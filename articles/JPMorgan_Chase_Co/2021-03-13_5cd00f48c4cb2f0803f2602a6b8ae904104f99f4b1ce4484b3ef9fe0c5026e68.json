  "text": "<p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose for the sixth consecutive session and set a record, boosted by signs that the domestic economy is revving up. </p><p>   The blue-chip gauge added 293.05 points, or 0.9%, to 32778.64, finishing its best week since November. The S&amp;P 500 edged lower for much of the session before turning higher and gaining 4 points, or 0.1%, to 3943.34, also a fresh high. The Nasdaq Composite lost 78.81 points, or 0.6%, to 13319.86. </p><p>   The Dow and S&amp;P 500 gained 4.1% and 2.6%, respectively, this week. The Nasdaq added 3.1% for the week, snapping a three-week streak of losses. It is still off 5.5% from Feb. 12's record. </p><p>   Stocks have broadly rallied this week, as everything from financials companies to Tesla and GameStop have advanced. After an extended stretch of volatility that briefly erased the tech-heavy Nasdaq's gains for the year, stocks regained their footing and notched fresh highs. </p><p>   There was a flurry of news that boosted the outlook for the domestic economy. President Biden signed the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package on Thursday. He also said every adult in the U.S. will be eligible to get a vaccine by May 1. </p><p>   Meanwhile, new data showed that consumers are growing more optimistic as well. Consumer sentiment in the U.S. increased in early March as more Americans have been vaccinated and job and income prospects have brightened. The preliminary estimate of the index of consumer sentiment compiled by the University of Michigan jumped to the highest since March 2020 and beat expectations. </p><p>   \"I expect a very robust recovery here in the short term,\" said Dev Kantesaria, a managing partner at Valley Forge Capital Management. \"I think it's going to happen faster and harder than most people expect.\" </p><p>   The latest leg of the stock rally has coincided with a sharp fall in government bond prices. On Friday, money managers again fled government bonds as their appetite for the safest assets waned, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note higher for the sixth consecutive week -- the longest winning streak since December 2016. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.634% on Friday, its highest level in more than a year, from 1.525% the prior session. </p><p>   Investors have also been forced to contend with a flood of new bonds entering the market, as the government funds trillions of dollars in coronavirus relief legislation, and Friday's wave of selling was the second in two months to come after successive 3-year, 10-year and 30-year debt auctions. </p><p>   Rising yields are seen as one factor behind the recent weakness in technology shares, because many investors use the 10-year yield as a discount rate in formulas to value stocks, and many technology companies are expected to make a greater proportion of their profits further in the future. Higher yields, though, can help banks by making their lending activity more profitable and generally reflect expectations for faster economic growth, which should also help most businesses. </p><p>   \"The bigger picture is, vaccines are going to create a sustainable reopening. That is what the market is reacting to,\" said David Stubbs, global head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"You're seeing a rapid reassessment of the macro environment.\" </p><p>   Many investors say they are bracing for greater turbulence ahead as government bond prices continue to fall and yields rise, weighing on tech stocks. </p><p>   In corporate news, shares of electric-truck startup Lordstown Motors dropped sharply, falling $2.93, or 17%, to $14.78 after short seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the company, saying it misled investors about its preorders and progress toward producing its first model. </p><p>   Tesla, which had logged a steep decline in recent weeks, rebounded and was one of the S&amp;P 500's best performers this week, gaining 16%. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
