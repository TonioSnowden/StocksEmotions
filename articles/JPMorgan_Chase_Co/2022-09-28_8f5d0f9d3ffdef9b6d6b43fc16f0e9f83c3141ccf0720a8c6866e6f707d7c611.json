  "title": "U.K. Markets Turmoil Puts Spotlight on New Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng; Britain's first Black chancellor wants big tax cuts but faces market resistance",
  "text": "<p>In recent days the pound has hit a record low against the dollar, yields on government debt have shot up and the International Monetary Fund has warned against the tax-cutting budget that it says will fuel already high inflation. On Wednesday, the Bank of England had to undertake emergency purchases of government bonds, leading to a rally in the bond market.</p><p>With investor confidence in the government's finances shaken, focus is sharply on whether Mr. Kwarteng, a libertarian former banker who once wrote a book on Margaret Thatcher, will reverse course. \"He is pretty ideological,\" says David Gauke, a former chief secretary to the U.K. treasury, who has known Mr. Kwarteng for decades. \"But if he doesn't recover market credibility very quickly, he is one way or another out of a job before very long.\"</p><p>So far, people familiar with the matter say that Mr. Kwarteng is showing no sign of compromising with the markets by tweaking his plan.</p><p>The 47-year-old Mr. Kwarteng has long been defined by his economics. The long-serving minister, who ascended party ranks after backing the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union in 2016, was among a coterie of Conservatives who argued that Brexit should be used to break with protectionism and deregulate. This view wasn't shared by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who promoted Mr. Kwarteng to a cabinet positionâ€”and imposed higher taxes while promising government intervention to bolster poorer parts of the nation.</p><p>After Mr. Johnson's sudden downfall, Mr. Kwarteng, now serving under Prime Minister Liz Truss, who shares his free-market vision for Brexit, has the power to carry it out. He is also the nation's first Black chancellor of the exchequer. Mr. Kwarteng declined to comment.</p><p>His supporters say that he is undertaking a brave supply-side revamp of the U.K. economy that has been hindered by low productivity growth since the financial crisis. Critics argue that Mr. Kwarteng's straight-talking style and plan to aggressively stimulate the economy don't chime with economic reality given the Bank of England sees inflation hitting 11% later in the year.</p><p>On Sunday, as markets were already reeling from the news of the surprise tax cuts, Mr. Kwarteng went on television to pledge more tax reductions were coming down the line, stoking further turmoil in the market. The Tories are lagging in the polls as voters worry hiking interest rates will leave them struggling to pay their mortgages.</p><p>\"I've never seen anything like this. I've been an economist for 50 years, I went through the Great Recession, I've never seen such raging incompetence, ever,\" David Blanchflower, a former member of the monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, told British broadcaster Sky News.</p><p>Supporters of the chancellor say they think the markets will eventually settle down and the government will be allowed to press on with its agenda.</p><p>\"There is great hysteria,\" says Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Cardiff Business School, who argues that concerns over inflation and the government taking on more debt are overblown. Mr. Minford, who advised Mrs. Thatcher back in the 1980s, praises Mr. Kwarteng and the government for \"trying to revive the Thatcher reforms, which have basically been sidetracked over three decades of drift.\"</p><p>Mr. Kwarteng's rise up the ranks has followed a conventional Conservative Party path. The son of Ghanaian immigrants, he attended the prestigious private school Eton before studying classics at Cambridge and then heading to Harvard as a Kennedy scholar. As a young man he was known for his self-confidence. At age 17 he was interviewed for a place at Cambridge. The Cambridge don turned up late and apologized. \"Don't worry,\" Mr. Kwarteng recalls saying. \"I am sure you will do very well.\" He later hit the headlines for swearing on live television as a contestant on the highbrow quiz show \"University Challenge.\"</p><p>He went into finance, working as an analyst for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Odey Asset Management and wrote several books, including one about the British Empire.</p><p>In 2010, Mr. Kwarteng was elected to Parliament at the same time as Ms. Truss. The two shared a similar economic outlook and formed a close political alliance. Ms. Truss created the Free Enterprise Group, a club of likeminded Conservatives, to push more free-market thinking within the party. Mr. Kwarteng joined her. Together with some other Conservative lawmakers they co-authored \"Britannia Unchained,\" a book that criticized British workers as \"the worst idlers\" in the world and lauded the merits of hard work and the small state. The two have remained close allies, living in the same borough in southeast London.</p><p>Growing up in London Mr. Kwarteng has spoken about how he was impressed by Mrs. Thatcher, who in the 1980s revamped the British economy by pruning labor unions and cutting taxes. Mr. Kwarteng's mother, a lawyer, respected the fact that Mrs. Thatcher, the daughter of a shop owner, was a self-made woman from a humble background, he said last year.</p><p>Mr. Kwarteng wrote a book analyzing how Mrs. Thatcher saved her political career in 1981 during a 180-day stint in which she fired cabinet dissenters and pushed through controversial reforms.</p><p>He has also shown a pragmatic streak, however. As secretary of state for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Mr. Kwarteng oversaw the response to the energy crunch in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Until recently, he helped the government's intervention to cap energy prices and ensure enough gas supply. One executive who dealt with him was impressed at his responsiveness and grasp of detail.</p><p>\"I think it does shape some of my approach, but one thing that history teaches you is that context is everything,\" Mr. Kwarteng said last year of his views of Mrs. Thatcher. \"Trying to relive the 1970s and 1980s in the 2020s is completely mistaken, and I would say a foolish thing to try to do.\"</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at Max.Colchester@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Markets Turmoil Puts Spotlight on New Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng</p>",
