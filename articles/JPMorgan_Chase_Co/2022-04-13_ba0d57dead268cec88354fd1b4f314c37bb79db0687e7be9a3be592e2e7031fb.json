  "title": "Here's the playbook from Credit Suisse's monetary plumbing guru if the rest of the world breaks free from the U.S. dollar",
  "text": "<p>The issue is, it's been breaking a lot — by Pozsar's telling, three times since 1997, most recently in 2019, when the Federal Reserve briefly lost control of the overnight interest-rate market. And Pozsar, as well as other experts, thinks the U.S. sanctions on Russia mark a momentous shift since the largest commodity producer in the world has been put in the penalty box.</p><p>Also read: Russian commodities today are like subprime CDOs were in 2008, says rates strategist</p><p>The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, he says, is far more powerful than either the Federal Open Market Committee or the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the moment. “The state does what the state does, and the FOMC will have to clean up the inflation that comes next,” he says.</p><p>Without price stability, there is no exorbitant privilege or dollar supremacy, says Pozsar. He says it's rational to ponder whether China will revalue the renminbi CNYUSD versus the dollar, and whether Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong will abandon their pegs. “After all, if [former Treasury Secretary] Larry Summers is right and the Fed will be forced to hike to close to 5%, and if we are right about the relative decline of the FX value of the U.S. dollar, why would anyone shadow the U.S. hiking cycle and crush domestic housing and suffer a spike in living costs due to a peg that no longer makes any sense,” he asks.</p><p>Money, he adds, can't buy commodities in times of shortages. “But, countries can choose to revalue their currencies if they've been suppressing their value, or rethink their FX pegs with an eye to maximize the commodities they can buy in a world of shortages,” he says.</p><p>What's his playbook? If you can't use quantitative tightening or hike your way out of inflation, then some decline of the U.S. dollar is inevitable, “and shorting U.S. rates, the U.S. dollar, and some FX pegs makes logical sense,” he says.</p><p>It should be noted that the U.S. dollar DXY hasn't, despite its critics, struggled during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and on Tuesday reached its highest level versus the euro EURUSD in more than a year. An expert plumber doesn't necessarily know how to build a house.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Happy earnings season — first-quarter results are due on Wednesday from JPMorgan Chase JPM, Delta Air Lines DAL and BlackRock BLK among others.</p><p>Producer price data highlight the day's economic releases.
