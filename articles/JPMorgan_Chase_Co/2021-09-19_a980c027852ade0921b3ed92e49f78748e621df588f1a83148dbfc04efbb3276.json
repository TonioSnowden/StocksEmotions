  "title": "Diversity Days at Veterans Affairs; President Biden's 'equity' agenda is off to a rough start.",
  "text": "<p>Why is the VA forcing its conversations with veterans through a filter of identity politics? The answer is that President Biden on Inauguration Day signed an executive order telling each federal agency to do an \"equity assessment\" within the next 200 days. Hence, the VA set up these conference calls to look for \"unmet needs of diverse Veteran populations\" and \"ways Veterans feel they can be included.\" In the abstract, finding unmet needs and unrecognized problems is a fine goal.</p><p>Yet in reality, slicing people into narrow identity groups has reduced opportunities for public comment. A hearing in Augusta was canceled when not enough veterans joined. The needed quorum, as the VA's facilitator explained, was \"at least three participants.\" Apologies to the one woman who showed up. Of six breakout groups in Louisville, Ky., last week, four were scotched, sorry again to the guy on the line. Broader open hearings might have at least let him speak.</p><p>Another Augusta call had a quorum but was ended after 10 minutes of dead air. That one was reserved for \"religious minorities and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent inequality.\" The VA's hosts prodded, but nobody came off mute. Ditto at Louisville's LGBTQ+ session.</p><p>Some of the substantive points came from women veterans. One said she thought physicians sometimes spoke to her condescendingly and blew off her concerns. Who among us hasn't ever felt that way? Yet the VA has a special reason to be on guard: Only about 10% of veterans are female, so women's health issues in particular might come across, if unintentionally, as an afterthought. Good for the VA to know.</p><p>Other valid criticisms can't be shoehorned into any identity box. A session last week aired comments about transportation difficulties and the VA's legendary wait times. Such problems have nothing to do with race, sexuality or religion. If you're a \"diverse\" veteran with thoughts, there's still time to speak up, since the listening sessions run through Sept. 30. But the VA's best strategy would be to spend its energy improving service, period, for everyone.</p><p>Diversity Days at Veterans Affairs</p>",
