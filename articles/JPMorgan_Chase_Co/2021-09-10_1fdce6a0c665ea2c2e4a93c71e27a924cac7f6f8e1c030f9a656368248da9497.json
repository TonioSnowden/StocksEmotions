  "text": "<p>First, a dispatch from the<strong> Elizabeth Holmes </strong>trial:</p> <p>On Wednesday I made the trek down the San Francisco peninsula to a federal courthouse in San Jose. The main attraction: Holmes, the <strong>Theranos</strong> founder who is now on trial for allegedly defrauding investors and patients by lying about the company's blood-testing technology and finances.</p> <p>The trial's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a04df52-4734-493b-a5d7-c9a6728e9e8d\">opening arguments</a> drew a crowd of journalists, attorneys and interested observers, including three women <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/a36806930/elizabeth-holmes-fans-tikt-tok/\">dressed in all-black outfits</a>, an apparent homage to Holmes's trademark style. Both sides presented spirited arguments, but one of the greatest revelations of the day came from the defence's first witness: a former Theranos controller who testified that KPMG, its outside auditor, declined to provide an opinion on the company's financials for six straight years.</p> <p>I'll be following the trial closely, so stay tuned for further dispatches.<em> — Miles Kruppa, FT venture capital correspondent</em></p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1435621048473456643\">https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1435621048473456643</a> <h2>Hedge funds' private eye</h2> <p>For hedge funds competing with venture capital and private equity, it's increasingly becoming a case of “if you can't beat 'em, join 'em”.&#xa0;</p> <p>A new wave of investors led by the likes of <strong>Tiger Global Management</strong>, <strong>Coatue Management</strong> and <strong>Altimeter Capital Management</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4935b205-8344-465a-8edf-dc23ec990302\">elbowing their way</a> into Silicon Valley at an unprecedented pace, with a record-smashing $153bn worth of investments in private companies by hedge funds in the first six months of 2021.</p> <p>Data from <strong>Goldman Sachs Prime Services</strong> highlight how hedge funds, typically known for investments in publicly traded assets, have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3684cf6-e95a-4e12-8848-0a38516792a4\">drawn to private markets</a> in an effort to fire up largely lacklustre returns.</p> <p>It also shows how private equity and venture capital have exploded in popularity over the past decade, particularly within the past three years. The asset class has soared to more than $7tn in value and is expected to double again by 2025, while the number of US public companies has roughly halved since 1996.</p> <p>All in all, it's resulting in increasingly blurry lines between different asset classes, said <strong>Diana Dieckman</strong>, Goldman's global head of capital introduction in prime services.</p> <p>The biggest players such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\">Tiger Global</a> and Coatue have raised billions of dollars for dedicated venture capital and private equity funds — separate from their traditional, evergreen hedge funds — helping to fuel the steep increase in dealmaking this year. Tiger Global is now attempting to raise a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11834bc1-f9b3-43a8-b142-7e890d85a11e\">record $10bn fund</a> for venture-style investments.</p> <p>It's worth noting that only a relatively small set of hedge funds are responsible for these private investments, with 75 per cent of the capital invested by just 10 firms.&#xa0;</p> <p>Competition is also an issue. Roughly three out of every four private deals done by hedge funds are in early-stage companies, and there's a record amount of private capital looking to invest in start-ups.&#xa0;</p> <p>In Silicon Valley, where venture capitalists have marked their turf, hedge funds' two-pronged pitch to companies is this: they can hold their shares well beyond a public listing, a point at which many VCs drop off, and coach executives on the ins and outs of being a public entity, according to Goldman.</p> <p>Based on the sheer amount of capital flooding into an industry that has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c87d52b2-d54e-4dae-9b50-98ca1e6c1d4c\">culled over the past decade</a>, that pitch appears to be working.</p> <h2>EasyJet leaves Wizz Air on the tarmac. Where to next?</h2> <p>While the Covid-19 crisis sent most of the aviation industry into a tailspin, the Hungarian low-cost carrier <strong>Wizz Air</strong> used its ultra-low-cost model to aggressively expand in western Europe.</p> <p>Guided by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81b6e087-7d40-4c3b-ba55-61d772f7a782\">dangling carrot</a> of a £100m reward if he can double its share price over five years, Wizz's chief <strong>Jozsef Varadi </strong>has been on a breakneck tour to rival Ryanair's <strong>Michael O'Leary</strong> as king of the budget-friendly skies.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Váradi's latest efforts turned fruitless this week, the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/philip-georgiadis\">Philip Georgiadis</a> and Oliver Ralph <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c2d5a82-c548-4f5a-aa06-3ad250855e72\">report</a>, when UK rival <strong>easyJet</strong> revealed it had rejected a takeover bid from an unnamed suitor, which was later revealed to be the Budapest-based airline.</p> <p>As easyJet's chief <strong>Johan Lundgren</strong> put it to the FT: “From an M&amp;A transaction point of view, we're not against that but it has to deliver value for the shareholders. And this wasn't even close to this.”</p> <p>Despite its firm rejection of Wizz's proposed takeover, the Luton-based carrier hasn't ruled out the prospect of M&amp;A altogether. EasyJet's leadership has signalled it could become a target or an acquirer in a future deal, said another person familiar with the situation.</p> <p>The group also announced plans on Thursday to raise £1.2bn in a rights issue to help quell its money problems after losing more than £2bn during the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the rights issue is priced at 410p a share — an inconvenient 36 per cent discount from the airline's closing share price on Wednesday and a sore deal for shareholders.</p> <p>Shareholders caught between a rock and a hard place are undoubtedly hoping easyJet's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0650e4f4-23b2-4d6f-a4a4-9beb69112739\">newly installed chair</a> and turnround specialist, City veteran <strong>Stephen Hester</strong>, has some tricks up his sleeve to steer them out of the red.</p> <h2>888/William Hill: fourth (or fifth?) time's the charm</h2> <p>It takes a gambler to go beyond the “third time lucky” rule.&#xa0;</p> <p>The online gambling group <strong>888</strong> has held deal talks with the UK bookmaker <strong>William Hill </strong>“three or four times”, according to 888 chief executive <strong>Itai Pazner</strong>, but it finally hit the jackpot this time around with a £2.2bn reverse takeover of its sports betting rival, the FT's Alice Hancock <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/665e77fb-ccaa-4a04-b8a3-1e5e8f947840\">reports</a>.</p> <p>London-listed 888 announced on Thursday that it would buy William Hill's non-US assets including businesses in the UK, Europe and an embryonic presence in Latin America using debt financing and a £500m equity raise. The deal comes after the US casino giant <strong>Caesars Entertainment </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e936c1dd-3adf-4449-b9fe-419b1ebc98a0\">snapped up</a> William Hill for £2.9bn last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Caesars said at the time of that deal that it would sell William Hill's non-US business as soon as the transaction completed.</p> <p>888 fended off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ca82f51-4433-46bb-a208-71bafc5b364a\">rival bids</a> from the buyout group <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, a previous owner of William Hill, and <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>. Caesars had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d40476e-cf69-45c4-85da-755db2a39b2e\">threatened to cut</a> its joint venture in the US with the UK bookmaker if Apollo won the deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>For digital-only 888, the acquisition brings with it an 87-year-old brand well-loved by British bettors and 1,400 UK betting shops at a time when the high street is making a slow recovery from the pandemic.</p> <p>Pazner insisted that 888 had no intention of selling the shops. They're part of the “attractiveness” of William Hill, he said, and a way to cross-sell between retail and online.</p> <p>For Caesars, offloading William Hill's non-US assets for £2.2bn makes its acquisition of the American business <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b776af7-2cb2-43b9-9e23-a12ab5d20aea\">look like a steal</a>. By the metrics of the 888 deal, it paid £700m for the US part of the company.</p> <p>If you take valuation multiples for<strong> DraftKings</strong> — a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f857e397-adab-4b95-b308-caa59b8d2b49\">rival betting brand</a> in the fast-growing US market — and William Hill US's 2019 revenues, the bookmaker's American assets could be worth at least four times that.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>KKR </strong>has appointed<strong> Kerryann Benjamin</strong> as its chief diversity officer and head of talent management.
