  "title": "Plug Power sees Inflation Reduction Act creating a 'boom' in its green hydrogen business, and stock soars; Plug believes IRA is a 'game changer' for the company and the hydrogen economy",
  "text": "<p>Plug Chief Executive Andrew Marsh said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts that the IRA provides a \"trifecta effect,\" as it's good for the climate, for jobs and for national security. And it's great for the company.</p><p>\"With the passage of the Act, we expect a boom for our electrolyzer and green hydrogen business,\" said Marsh said, according to a FactSet transcript. \"All applications that use gray hydrogen [produced from fossil fuels] today, such as fertilizer manufacturing, will now be able to buy green hydrogen at a competitive price with gray.\"</p><p>The stock PLUG charged 15.3% higher in afternoon trading. It was down as much as 4.0% in after-hours trading Tuesday soon after Plug reported second-quarter results, and down as much as 4.3% in Wednesday's premarket, before reversing course.</p><p>The company reported after Tuesday's close a second-quarter net loss that widened to $173.3 million, or 30 cents a share, from a loss of $99.6 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. That missed the FactSet consensus for per-share losses of 21 cents.</p><p>Revenue grew 21.4% to $151.3 million, but was below the FactSet consensus of $159.0 million.</p><p>Cost of revenue rose less than revenue, up 11.5% to $183.7 million, as gross margin improved to 21.5% from 32.4%.</p><p>The company reiterated its 2022 target of $900 million to $925 million in revenue.</p><p>In a letter to shareholders, the company said the IRA was a \"tremendous catalyst\" for all forms of clean energy development, and \"a game changer\" for Plug, as the PTC should further enhance its leadership in the green hydrogen ecosystem.</p><p>\"We believe that the PTC will help capital formation, recycling of capital, and back leveraging,\" the letter said.</p><p>\"We believe this dynamic provides access to a larger pool of capital to help accelerate the growth of the green hydrogen industry while reducing the levelized cost of green hydrogen,\" the letter added.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analyst William Peterson reiterated his overweight rating on Plug, but raised his stock price target to $32 from $28. Although the results confirmed the headwinds to margins that he was expecting, they also showed improvement, which could speed up the timeline to profitability.</p><p>\"[R]ecent policy updates, including the proposal of hydrogen production tax credits and fuel cell investment tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act could bring the company toward profitability inflection ~6 months earlier than expected, provide $500 million of incremental annual cash flow and reduce hydrogen plant payback periods by 4-5 years (~half the time than without incentives),\" Peterson wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Also read: Fuel cell, EV and solar stocks rally as climate bill makes 'alternative' energy 'more in the money.'</p><p>Oppenheimer's Colin Rusch also kept his rating at outperform and his stock price target at $63, which implies a more than doubling from current levels.</p><p>\"We believe Plug is uniquely positioned to benefit from the [IRA] legislation with its leading position in green hydrogen,\" Rusch wrote. \"We expect the company to aggressively book new business with numerous customers and build out a comprehensive green hydrogen network in the U.S. serving industrial applications first, followed by incremental material handling, stationary power and over-the-road transportation.\"</p><p>Plug's stock has soared 81.1% over the past three months, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 4.9%.</p><p>Plug Power sees Inflation Reduction Act creating a 'boom' in its green hydrogen business, and stock soars</p>",
