  "text": "<p>Dear reader,</p> <p>I suspect that, you, like me, would be happy to wrap up 2021 a fortnight early.</p> <p>I once chaired the three-hour morning session of a large conference in London. The disorganised organisers had scheduled no comfort breaks. The last speaker, UK government minister Margaret Hodge, exceeded her allotted time span by half an hour.</p> <p>When I returned to the podium with the fatal trigger words “time for some concluding remarks”, 450 thirsty, loo-craving delegates rose <em>en masse</em> and stampeded for the exits.</p> <p>That is how most of us feel about the wearying second year of the Great Pandemic. But it has taught us valuable lessons on investment that will hold good next year, firstly:</p> <h2>Global capital is now unafraid of coronavirus</h2> <p>The pandemic is very bad for a tight group of businesses dependent on public mingling. These include travel groups such as UK bus company Stagecoach, ignominiously set to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4ae1849-bfb1-48f2-8905-6ebad2296c66\">taken over</a> for a fifth of its 2015 market value. Another victim is Cineworld, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd24bcdf-ec8c-4e70-932f-86f67e4b1580\">ordered to pay $930m</a> in damages for backing out of an acquisition devalued by lockdowns.</p> <p>Most large, listed businesses do not depend on public mingling. Some — notably tech groups such as Amazon, Facebook and Zoom — thrive on the physical isolation of customers.</p> <p>Omicron is generating lots of scary headlines. But markets broadly see the new variant as more of the same. Once scientists developed vaccines against coronavirus, it ceased to be much of a menace to asset prices, not least because . . . </p> <h2>Central banks have a bias towards stimulus</h2> <p>This week, the UK became the first G7 economy to raise interest rates since the start of the pandemic, even if very modestly. The Fed signalled plans to do the same in 2022. The European Central Bank expects &#xa0;to rein in stimulus a little.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 and the equivalent Stoxx Europe 600 indices look set to finish the year near record highs. Broadly, they expect monetary policy to remain loose. Lex thinks they may be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/276fea69-f4aa-4f48-aee1-23ac514386c1\">too sanguine</a> — after all inflation is at 6.8 per cent in the US and 6 per cent in the UK. We believe . . . </p> <h2>The belief that inflation is transitory will itself be transitory</h2> <p>Corporations and the middle classes are emerging from a pandemic whose ill effects are proving highly selective. They have trillions on deposit they are starting to spend. Credit remains cheap and plentiful. Supplies of many products and commodities — notably silicon chips and oil — are constrained for structural reasons as well as because of short-term supply snafus.</p> <p>Six months ago, Lex disagreed with bullish analysts. We bet that oil would not hit<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d728b9ee-6803-4770-85ca-0256d9bd8507\"> $100 per barrel</a> in the near-term. This caused some ribbing in FT news conferences every time the black stuff hit a new peak.</p> <p>It looks like we will win our bet (as well as the wager that carbon will end up priced around<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eef4872c-e52b-4cf6-9853-fb2bf19889a1\"> $100 per tonne</a>). Even so, Brent is pricey at $75. The price rise has forced several UK energy suppliers out of business, not least because bungling politicians and regulators had imposed price controls. Supplier Octopus is doing well partly because of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75e7d918-6dae-46fc-b471-ab8f044102a9\">strong tech offering</a>. We see Ofgem's call for new powers as a land grab in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91e6c1d9-4750-4c29-971a-a116da4405e2\">serious failures</a> on its part.</p> <p>Freight rates for transporting liquefied natural gas are, meanwhile, at record highs. South Korea's Daewoo Shipbuilding should pray for trustbusters to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df25dd5f-8c33-4e78-becc-97549176a121\">nix its acquisition</a> for $2bn by local rival Hyundai Heavy. The dash for gas means it would have a buoyant independent future. However . . . </p> <h2>Not every kid will get a lollipop . . . </h2> <p>Hot money particularly favours assets with no disappointing public market earnings history, such as electric vehicle Spac floats. Cryptos, including non-fungible tokens, are even more alluring to speculators because they are not supposed to have an intrinsic yield, even in a few years. A witty <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/ccb48782-82f9-44ef-97c7-dcfa02431123\">animation </a>for Lex by Russell Birkett explained how we see cryptos entering the financial mainstream.</p> <p>There is a better case for businesses at the heart of the tech revolution to boast high valuations. Lex likes companies that can exploit big data and adjacent sensor businesses such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53dd1cfe-f285-4719-8761-3be8ee5b1b74\">Samsara</a>. These help create data flows that may give investors a better take on financial trends than lagging, massaged company results. Data from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57f212d4-18b4-4e63-8496-13d2057165cf\">lifts</a>, for example, delineate office occupancy while raising the kind of privacy concerns Lex correctly predicted would delay the initial public offering of Chinese artificial intelligence group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b5aabf1-532e-4b0a-816d-f0e9b31dc9fc\">SenseTime</a>.</p> <p>The tech revolution/bubble leaves dull, ex-growth mature businesses undervalued. That is particularly so if they are in Brexit-impaired Britain. Foreigners can see the arbitrage even if the UK's powerful income funds cannot. French telecoms entrepreneur Patrick Drahi has built an 18 per cent exposure to legacy telecoms champion BT. We think he may mount a protracted campaign for BT to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66d2ab8b-d93b-4b91-8efd-396659f59c5a\">realise value</a> from broadband infrastructure subsidiary Openreach.</p> <p>UK undervaluation has also sparked a flood of inbound mergers and acquisitions. Pest controller Rentokil, a UK stock market darling again after decades in the cold, briefly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25f201ba-8f7b-4740-ba1d-4ca3f9d9146c\">reversed the flow</a> this week with the $6.7bn acquisition of Terminix of the US. Whatever the direction, the global deal surge means . . . </p> <h2>. . . every good banker will get a bonus</h2> <p>Wall Street's big five investment banks increased revenues 44 per cent in the first nine months of 2021. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase may increase bonus pools around the same amount. Rewards are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e4106ce-3273-4c4f-a3ab-46349a056702\">asymmetric </a>— they do not fall proportionately in bad years. The same applies to the pay of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4623a3f-3094-4064-8979-cc697f4fe30d\">chief executives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3c0a2fa-755b-48c2-9a57-db605a1ab06a\">private equity bosses</a>.</p> <p>Lex sees wealth capture at the proprietorial and professional apex of the capitalist system as an unstoppable trend. It justifies investment in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e49fa4a0-4ca3-450c-a81e-9531765be6d9\">high-end property</a>, wealth managers and luxury goods groups.</p> <p>Amid the festive riot of present-giving it is good to remember the have-nots. These include Santa Claus himself. There is a shortage of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72cc143c-741a-44af-86f1-a3093fd74bcf\">shopping mall Father Christmases</a>, reflecting infection risks and low pay.</p> <p>In the absence of a Santa relief fund, I will be slinging a chunk of my own modest bonus to other good causes, of which the <a href=\"https://ftflic.com/\">FT's Financial Literacy &amp; Inclusion Campaign</a> is a worthy member.</p> <p>This is the last Lex newsletter of 2021. It will return on January 7. The column itself will publish throughout the festive season. We have some great stuff lined up for you, including pieces on extended human longevity, new-era sailing ships and AI-generated novels.</p> <p>Thanks for reading and happy holidays,</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong><br><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2021 'Best of Lex: global capital is unafraid of Omicron' FT.com 17 December.
