  "text": "<p>Schwab's first-quarter net income fell to $1.4 billion from $1.48 billion in the same period last year. Net revenue fell to $4.67 billion from $4.72 billion. Per-share adjusted earnings were 77 cents, down from 84 cents a year earlier. Analysts expected $4.83 billion in revenue, according to FactSet, and 84 cents of adjusted earnings per share.</p><p>First-quarter trading revenue at Schwab fell 21% to $963 million, down from $1.2 billion a year earlier. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. notched declines in trading revenue in the first quarter, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley both saw a 4% increase.</p><p>Earnings season so far has challenged bank and financial-services stocks. JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. last week reported declining profits in the face of bumper profits during the pandemic. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has fallen 5.1% since the end of the first quarter and is down 20% from January's 2022 highs.</p><p>Bank of America Corp. on Monday said its first-quarter profit fell 12%, its first quarterly decline since 2020. Its shares finished up 3.4% as revenue exceeded analysts' expectations.</p><p>Persistent inflation, slowing consumer spending and geopolitical tension have weighed on financial institutions' shares. Banks notched blockbuster profits last year, thanks to pandemic-fueled gains in trading and deal-making, along with surging deposits because of government stimulus.</p><p>Investors this week will look to results from smaller banks and financial services firms to gain insight into the economy's health, with M&amp;T Bank Corp., Truist Financial Corp. and Citizens Financial Group Inc. reporting.</p>",
