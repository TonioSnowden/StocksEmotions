  "text": "<p>US government debt extended a rally on Wednesday as traders pared back their bets on an aggressive series of interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve this year. </p> <p>The two-year Treasury yield, which is highly sensitive to monetary policy expectations, sank as much as 0.14 percentage points to 2.27 per cent, its lowest level this month. Yields fall when prices rise.</p> <p>It later reversed some of the move to trade at 2.35 per cent, down 0.06 percentage points for the day. </p> <p>Futures markets show investors now expect the Fed to raise rates by a further 2 percentage points by the end of the year, down a quarter of a percentage point from earlier in the week.</p> <p>The moves came after Tuesday's US consumer price data showed closely watched “core” inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, slowed unexpectedly in March. The annual headline figure <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b075001b-5cab-4641-a483-f3e470953166\">increased 8.5 per cent</a>, slightly above analysts' expectations. </p> <p>“Everyone seems to think inflation's peaking. So people are basically shorting rates,” said Eric Fine, a portfolio manager at VanEck.</p> <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 0.03 percentage points to 2.69 per cent.</p> <p>“The big news in the March [inflation] report was that core price pressures finally appear to be moderating,” said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, adding that supply shortages of goods and congestion at ports were showing signs of easing.</p> <p>Energy prices, a crucial driver of inflation, were expected to ease over the rest of the year, he added. But he said the Fed was unlikely to stray from its widely trailed plan to raise rates by 0.5 percentage points at its May meeting. </p> <p>“Having been slow to realise that the initial surge wasn't transitory, Fed officials are now being a bit too pessimistic about how quickly inflation will drop back,” Hunter said. </p> <p>Data on Wednesday showed US producer prices last month rose at an annual rate of 11.2 per cent, well above economists' expectations. </p> <p>The shift in interest rate expectations also lifted stock markets, particularly high-growth technology stocks that are considered to be particularly vulnerable to higher rates. The US benchmark S&amp;P 500 index added 1.1 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2 per cent.</p> <p>Kicking off bank earnings season, JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2eb49e29-dbf8-4d5f-be40-94915ae5e6d0\">reported a 42 per cent year-on-year drop in net income </a>for the first quarter, after a slowdown in dealmaking, a rise in reserves to protect against a US recession, and a $524mn loss suffered amid market turbulence following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The bank's shares fell 3.2 per cent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4a4facf-3bf9-4b28-8264-d5231d4ea9db\">BlackRock fared better</a>, posting $1.46bn in adjusted net income for the first quarter, up close to a fifth compared with the same period a year ago.</p> <p>In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 share index closed the session flat. Germany's Dax fell 0.3 per cent and France's Cac 40 added 0.1 per cent. London's FTSE 100 added 0.1 per cent.</p> <p>Data on Wednesday showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e659559-c9b8-48fe-9f8f-590ae1cfed3b\">UK inflation</a> rose to a new 30-year high last month, led by the rising cost of fuel. Consumer prices increased 7 per cent year on year in March, up from 6.2 per cent the month before. Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise 6.7 per cent. </p> <p>Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, predicted prices would peak at 8.5 per cent in April before cooling later in the year as energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks eased. </p> <p>Oil prices rose on Wednesday, with international benchmark Brent crude up 4 per cent to $108.78 a barrel. </p> <p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.3 per cent and China's CSI 300 fell 1 per cent. Japan's Topix rose 1.4 per cent and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.9 per cent.</p><p>Source: George Steer and Tommy Stubbington in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2022 'Treasuries extend rally as traders weigh future direction of monetary policy' FT.com 13 April.
