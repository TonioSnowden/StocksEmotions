  "title": "NYSE  Parent's  Crypto  Unit to  Go Public  ----  By Alexander Osipovich",
  "text": "<p>   The New York Stock Exchange's owner will take its cryptocurrency venture public by merging it with a special-purpose acquisition company, a deal that will further its goal of launching a consumer app for trading and making payments with digital assets. </p><p>   The venture by NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., called Bakkt, is expected to have a valuation of $2.1 billion after completing the merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, the companies said on Monday. </p><p>   The deal brings together two of the hottest plays in today's markets: crypto and SPACs. Bitcoin last week surged above $40,000 for the first time, and SPACs had their biggest year ever in 2020, raising $83 billion in new listings, according to data provider SPACInsider. SPACs, also called blank-check companies, are vehicles that go public to raise cash for mergers and acquisitions. </p><p>   As part of the deal, Bakkt will raise an additional $532 million from VPC's funds and a concurrent capital raise. That will support development and marketing of the Bakkt App, which is envisioned as a tool to let people manage their holdings of various digital assets. These could include bitcoin, reward programs, like those offered by Starbucks Corp. and airlines, and virtual assets from videogames. </p><p>   More than 400,000 people preregistered for the app, which is expected to have a wide public rollout in March, Bakkt says. Bakkt projects the app will amass more than 30 million users in five years, according to a presentation about the deal released on Monday. That ambitious target would put Bakkt in the same league as other blockbuster financial apps like Robinhood, Venmo or Cash App. </p><p>   Bakkt also said Monday it was hiring Gavin Michael, a veteran banking-technology executive, as its new chief executive. Mr. Michael was most recently head of technology for Citigroup Inc.'s consumer bank, and previously had a similar role at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. </p><p>   The traditional core business of Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, is operating exchanges and clearinghouses used by banks and large trading firms. Bakkt is its first consumer-oriented business. </p><p>   In taking Bakkt public, ICE chose to merge it with a SPAC rather than holding an initial public offering. A firm that merges with a blank-check company gains its spot on a stock exchange. </p><p>   VPC is backed by Victory Park Capital, an investment firm based in Chicago. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter. The SPAC is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, but plans to switch to the NYSE after the Bakkt deal. </p><p>   ICE will retain a majority stake in Bakkt after the deal. Bakkt will gain visibility as a publicly traded company with its own stock ticker, helping it promote its brand and the new app, ICE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said. </p><p>   Mr. Sprecher has previously called Bakkt a \"moonshot\" bet. He said the venture has made solid progress since ICE launched it in 2018. </p><p>   Bakkt's first CEO was Kelly Loeffler, who left the venture when she was appointed a senator for Georgia. Ms. Loeffler, who is married to Mr. Sprecher, lost a runoff election last week. </p><p></p>",
