  "text": "<p>\"That fiscal stimulation is still in the pocketbooks of consumers. They are spending it,\" he said at an investor conference Wednesday.</p><p>U.S. households boosted spending for a fourth straight month in April, but the rate at which they were setting aside savings fell to its lowest point in 14 years, according to data released last week. That raised concerns that consumers were tapping into savings to keep up with inflation and that the pandemic stimulus had run out.</p><p>Mr. Dimon said the data is heavily distorted by inflation impacts and shifting consumer-spending patterns in goods and services. Lower-income households aren't quite as healthy, he added.</p><p>JPMorgan said in April that its customers—many of whom are affluent—were spending more on travel and dining. Mr. Dimon said the strong job market and higher wages would bolster it along.</p><p>Mr. Dimon has been warning that the economy faces uncertainty, in part because unprecedented stimulus continues to play a role. He said Wednesday that there was an economic hurricane brewing. For instance, he said, the war in Ukraine continues to roil commodity markets and could push oil pricesabove $150 a barrel. Brent crude was trading around $117 a barrel on Wednesday.</p><p>\"That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"We just don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy. You have to brace yourself.\"</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Jamie Dimon Says U.S. Consumers Still Have Six to Nine Months of Spending Power</p>",
