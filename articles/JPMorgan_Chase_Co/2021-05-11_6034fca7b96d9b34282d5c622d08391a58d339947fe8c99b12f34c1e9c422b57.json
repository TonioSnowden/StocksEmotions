  "text": "<p>Law firm Linklaters has appointed its first female senior partner in its 183-year history, selecting global corporate head Aedamar Comiskey for the role.</p> <p>On Tuesday the “magic circle” firm revealed that Comiskey would replace corporate veteran Charlie Jacobs and start a five-year term on July 1.</p> <p>“I am hugely proud to have been elected the firm's first female senior partner. It is an honour and a privilege,” Comiskey said.</p> <p>In a statement, she added that she wanted “Linklaters to stand out as the law firm with the best minds in the business from truly diverse backgrounds, contributing different perspectives to solve the complex challenges facing business and society today”.</p> <p>Comiskey joined Linklaters 29 years ago and made partner in 2001. She is a respected corporate partner who recently advised G4S on its high-profile <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5559c3de-cb0e-4ad7-9598-66d3b376470e\">contested takeover</a>. The lawyer — an early favourite in the process — ran against London corporate and M&amp;A partner Sarah Wiggins, and Milan-based western Europe managing partner, Claudia Parzani.&#xa0;</p> <p>Her appointment comes as UK law firms are shifting towards better representation&#xa0;among their upper ranks for women and people from a variety of backgrounds. </p> <p>In recent months a number of women have been elected to head up rivals including Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Herbert Smith Freehills.</p> <p>However, most firms have a long way to go to achieve gender parity. At Linklaters, whose equity partners received £1.6m last year, UK-based female staff including equity partners earned on average 62.9 per cent less than men in 2020, according to the firm's annual pay gap report.</p> <p>Comiskey's term is expected to include fierce debate about potential changes to the firm's pay structure, as it attempts to compete with aggressive competition from US firms.</p> <p>As senior partner she is also the firm's chair, a role akin to the chair of a listed company board. Linklaters also has a managing partner, which is comparable to the chief executive at a public company.&#xa0;</p> <p>Current managing partner Gideon Moore will stand down in 2022, triggering the firm's second management election in as many years. </p> <p>Jacobs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02260413-526e-45d4-a44e-082fb6cb5979\">will leave</a> later this year to become co-head of UK investment banking at JPMorgan. The South African lawyer has spent his entire career at Linklaters and became associated with corporate deals for clients including Glencore.&#xa0;</p> <p>In a statement on Tuesday he said: “I have known Aedamar for her whole career at Linklaters. I have so much admiration for her client focus, strategic thinking and leadership skills, not to mention her energy and passion for our people, culture and communities. I know she will lead the firm with confidence and distinction.”</p><p>Source: Kate Beioley in London 2021 'Linklaters appoints first female senior partner ' FT.com 11 May.
