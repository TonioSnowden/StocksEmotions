  "text": "<p>Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted loss of 14 cents a share on sales of $681 million, according to FactSet. Shares were down more than 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement, after closing with a 2.3% loss at $345.77.</p><p>Twilio's software, which allows companies to converse with customers through text messages, experienced a surge in the second half last year thanks to political campaigns seeking to communicate with voters. Lapping that period was expected to depress Twilio's bottom line and sales-growth numbers, but analysts have hope that those numbers will recover in the coming months.</p><p>“We acknowledge tough comps in Q3/Q4 due to heavy political messaging traffic last year, and do not see improvement in gross margins yet due to traction of lower-margin core messaging products, but see very healthy demand signals from partners plus the rise of 2-way messaging causing investors to re-rate growth prospects and the stock into” the first half of next year, J.P. Morgan analysts wrote earlier this month after speaking with Twilio partners.</p><p>For the fiscal fourth quarter, Twilio projected an adjusted loss of between 23 cents and 26 cents a share on sales of $760 million to $770 million. Analysts on average were projecting an adjusted loss of 10 cents a share on sales of $745 million, according to FactSet.</p><p>Twilio shares have struggled amid concerns about second-half growth rates, falling 12.7% in the past six months while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX grew 9.3%. Still, shares have grown more than 850% since the company went public in 2016.</p>",
