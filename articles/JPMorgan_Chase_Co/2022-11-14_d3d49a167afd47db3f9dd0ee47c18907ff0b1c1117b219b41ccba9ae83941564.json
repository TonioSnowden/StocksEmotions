  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start</strong>: <strong>Galois Capital</strong>, a San Francisco-based hedge fund whose founder is credited with spotting the collapse of cryptocurrency luna earlier this year, has been caught off-guard after about half its assets were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/726277bb-35a1-4d35-9df9-3e1cca587b77\">left trapped</a> on crypto exchange <strong>FTX</strong>, which filed for bankruptcy on Friday.</p> <h1>Follow the ‘smart' money?</h1> <p>The demise of <strong>FTX</strong> marks a stunning collapse for <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>'s crypto empire that was valued at $32bn just months ago.<br><br>Since its launch in 2019, FTX has raised $1.8bn from a list of shareholders that reads like a who's who of the investor world. It features <strong>Sequoia Capital, Thoma Bravo</strong>, <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>SoftBank</strong>, Singapore state-owned fund <strong>Temasek</strong>, <strong>Tiger Global</strong> and the <strong>Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</strong>, as well as some of the world's most-respected hedge fund managers, including <strong>Brevan Howard Asset Management</strong>'s <strong>Alan Howard</strong>, <strong>Millennium Management</strong>'s <strong>Izzy Englander</strong> and the family of <strong>Paul Tudor Jones</strong>.</p> <p>Their collective support helped lend Bankman-Fried's business empire credibility before its sudden collapse, driven by concerns about its links with his <strong>Alameda Research</strong> proprietary trading group. </p> <p>Now these investors will be left facing tough questions from their own clients about how they got it so wrong, why they didn't demand a seat on FTX's board, and whether they ever really understood how the business was making money.</p> <p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67b1899f-4b1f-4676-b264-0d19e205d64e\">full story here</a> of how Bankman-Fried seduced blue-chip investors, including the surprise phone call from an old university professor that launched private equity investor <strong>Orlando Bravo</strong> into becoming one of his most prominent and vocal supporters.</p> <h1>Pension funds rethink asset allocation</h1> <p>When UK pension funds started to buckle under the turbulence caused by the Truss government's “mini” Budget in September, senior executives at <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> were taking no chances. </p> <p>The supermarket group's pension fund, which has more than 70,000 members, had weathered the initial market volatility. But the company, fearful of more ructions once the Bank of England stabilisation measures were withdrawn, hurriedly set up a loan facility for £500mn.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>“We decided to put a short-term loan in place should [the pension fund] require it,” said <strong>Sainsbury</strong>'s chief financial officer <strong>Kevin O'Byrne</strong>. “If there was a spike [in gilt yields] . . . we didn't want them to have to do anything irrational like selling assets at the wrong time.”&#xa0;</p> <p>In the end, the trustees did not need to draw on the cash. Shortly after the loan facility was set up, Britain changed chancellor and the markets stabilised. </p> <p>But the episode illustrates how wild swings in the gilt markets have taught UK pension funds an important lesson: assets that cannot be quickly converted to cash may deliver higher returns, but in a crisis pension schemes need assets they can sell fast. </p> <p>“There'll be a new focus on liquidity,” says <strong>Andrew Lewis</strong>, chief financial officer of FTSE 250 aerospace and defence group <strong>Chemring</strong>. “I don't think people really understood the liquidity risk, which is very different from the funding risk.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The immediate impact of the gilt market chaos has been to shine a light on liability-driven investing, which has become a widely used strategy over the past two decades among the UK's 5,200 defined benefit (DB) pension schemes. </p> <p>But, as we explore in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1854d64f-491d-432e-9899-2fd565e7ff06\">Big Read</a>, as the dust settles, there are likely to be important reverberations throughout the rest of the investment sector. The market chaos is accelerating the rethink that was already under way among pension funds about the so-called 60/40 allocation of assets between equities and bonds, which has performed poorly during this year's sell-off. </p> <p>It's been “a nightmare for allocation,” says <strong>Vincent Mortier</strong>, chief investment officer at <strong>Amundi</strong>. “The 60/40 model has been broken for some time and totally broken for a year.”</p> <p>And the renewed focus on liquidity could reduce the amount that pension funds seek to allocate to private markets — despite a government push to get them to invest more in infrastructure projects. </p> <p>“In the aftermath of the LDI crisis the strategic asset allocation of DB schemes will change materially,” says <strong>Michael Eakins</strong>, chief investment officer at <strong>Phoenix Group</strong>, one of the UK's largest savings and retirement businesses. “They will be less invested in private markets and more in liquid markets like bonds and gilts.”&#xa0;</p> <p>What does the LDI crisis mean for asset allocation?
