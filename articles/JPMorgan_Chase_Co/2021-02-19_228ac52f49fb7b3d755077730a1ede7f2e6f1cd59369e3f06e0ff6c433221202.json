  "text": "<p>The U.K.-based bank on Thursday posted a GBP 3 billion profit before tax for 2020, equivalent to $4.16 billion, with strong capital markets returns offsetting contraction in its retail and credit-card businesses. After years of activist pressure, Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley claimed victory for his strategy of a combined retail and investment bank. Barclays gained share and booked bumper profit in capital markets, offsetting poor results in its credit-card and retail businesses. But overall return on tangible equity was still a disappointing 3.2%, well below its 10% long-term target. Shares fell about 4%, trading near 0.45 times book value.</p><p>Granted, last year was particularly nasty. Often during a downturn, customers and small businesses run up their debts slightly as they weather the storm, giving banks higher revenues but also higher loan-loss provisions. This time, fear pushed consumers and small businesses to pay down their debts and save cash even as provisions for loan losses jumped. But the investment banking upside was also pretty extraordinary. Given the massive liquidity and volatility in the capital markets, it could be argued that the trading profit should have been big enough to generate decent overall returns.</p><p>At many U.S. banks, they indeed were. In 2020, JPMorgan Chase posted a 14% return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and Citigroup made 6.9%.</p><p>Management counts 2020 as a decent result under the extreme circumstances. The strategy is sound and the bank has the right footprint, says Mr. Staley, it just needs to execute as the economy reopens after vaccines rollout. It is possible. Barclays' U.K. and U.S. credit businesses used to provide double-digit returns, and a bounceback in consumer spending could bring back those levels. The lender will also need to hold on to some of the market-share gains made in the group's trading business.</p><p>Another key to boosting return on equity is capital payouts. Barclays has traditionally given priority to a growing dividend, buying no stock back since before the financial crisis. But with share values so low, the bank is breaking with this practice and plans to buy back GBP 700 million of shares in the first half of this year. Given the lender's generous capital buffers, more buybacks are possible particularly if price-to-book value of shares remains low. This could help narrow the gap with U.S. peers.</p><p>This smooth recovery could be tripped up. The pandemic could persist or lingering fears might keep consumers saving rather than spending. Brexit changes might damage the British economy or the Bank of England could decide to cut rates below zero.</p><p>This past year has validated Mr. Staley's decision to keep an investment bank. However, Barclays, like many other European banks, still needs to prove it can provide returns over the course of an entire economic cycle.</p>",
