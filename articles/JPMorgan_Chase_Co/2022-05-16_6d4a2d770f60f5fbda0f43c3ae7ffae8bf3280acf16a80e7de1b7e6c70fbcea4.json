  "title": "Stocks Open Lower to Start the Week; Weak Chinese economic data showed the cost of strict Covid-19 lockdowns",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 suffered its worst weekly losing streak since June 2011, even after posting gains on Friday, and is flirting with bear market territory, a level 20% lower than a recent high.</p><p>Investors, worried that the Federal Reserve has been too late to spot the risks from soaring inflation, fear the central bank will move too aggressively to fight it, a mistake that could tip the economy into a recession.</p><p>The resulting selloff, which has been compounded by the war in Ukraine and Covid-19 lockdowns in China, has been broad, affecting most assets from cryptocurrencies and stocks to government bonds, leaving investors unsure of where to seek safety.</p><p>After weeks of losses, some investors are holding on to stocks, or buying more, hoping declines are reaching their nadir. Others are settling in for a protracted period of volatility.</p><p>\"We are moving into a more challenging time for markets. We need to see signs that inflation is not just peaking but actually decelerating before you find a sustainable bottom in the market. That is going to take at least a couple of months,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.</p><p>\"That doesn't mean we won't have counter-rallies higher from day to day, but I think this is a long, drawn-out process and it is largely data-driven,\" he said.</p><p>After the opening bell, Twitter shares fell 3.6% after Elon Musk on Saturday said the company's legal team accused him of violating a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Musk Friday said that his $44 billion acquisition of the social-media company was on hold, sending the company's shares down nearly 10%.</p><p>Spirit Airlines jumped 9.3% after The Wall Street Journal reported that JetBlue Airways plans to launch a hostile takeover attempt of the discount carrier.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 2.90% from 2.932% on Friday.</p><p>In commodities, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 0.1% to $111.45 a barrel. Gold prices ticked down 0.2%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was flat. In mainland China, major stock indexes fell after weaker-than-expected data showed the economic cost of strict lockdowns imposed to control Covid-19 outbreaks. Retail sales fell about 11% year-over-year in April and industrial production contracted 2.9% on the same basis, while growth in fixed-asset investment slowed.</p><p>The CSI 300 Index, which tracks the 300 largest companies listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, fell 0.8%, while the broader Shanghai Composite lost 0.3%. Mainland property stocks outperformed, jumping 1.6% after Chinese authorities lowered the minimum interest rate for mortgages extended to first-time home buyers.</p><p>\"The April economic numbers have confirmed investors' concerns about a China slowdown,\" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. Although Shanghai has laid out a reopening plan and domestic Covid-19 cases have been declining, investors only expect a gradual recovery over the coming weeks and months, he said.</p><p>Still, U.S. markets have already sold off markedly in recent weeks, partly on concerns about Chinese supply-chain disruptions, so the weak data were unlikely to have much impact on broader global markets, Mr. Hui said.</p><p>Elsewhere in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo rose 0.5%, while South Korea's Kospi Composite edged down 0.3%.</p><p>â€”Rebecca Feng contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Open Lower to Start the Week</p>",
