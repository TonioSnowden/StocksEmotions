  "title": "Crypto is ‘not a fad' says Morgan Stanley CEO Gorman, ‘It's not going away'",
  "text": "<p>Gorman's take on bitcoinBTCUSD and EtherETHUSD on the Ethereum blockchain feels miles from his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM.</p><p>Earlier this week, Jamie Dimon offered what is becoming a relatively standard response to questions about crypto. “I personally think that bitcoin is worthless,”&#xa0;said the JPMorgan CEO,&#xa0;speaking briefly at the annual Institute of International Finance event.&#xa0;</p><p>Morgan Stanley's Gorman isn't a full-throated bitcoin and crypto rally cry, but he is suggesting that there may be something more than fleeting to digital assets beyond the hype and bluster that sometimes surrounds it.</p><p>Gorman offered a fairly levelheaded assessment of virtual currencies that have increasingly gained mainstream attraction, with bitcoin knocking on the door of a record around $60,000 and companies and investors trying to figure out whether and/or how the asset fits into a balance sheet in an investment portfolio.</p><p>Gorman said of his observations of client behavior, of late: “Nobody's putting 10% of their portfolio into it…it's not a core part of their diversification strategy…it is an option” that they are looking at, he told the business network.</p><p>Morgan Stanley became one of the first banks to offer access to crypto among its qualified clientele earlier this year.</p><p>Of course, JPMorgan also is offering some crypto as well (and even created its own interbank digital currency), but the CEO's grudging acceptance of the emergence of digital assets has been off-putting to many crypto bulls.</p><p>“Our clients are adults…so, if they want to have access to buy yourself bitcoin, we can't custody it, but we could give them legitimate, as clean as possible, access,”&#xa0;said Dimon.</p><p>Gorman notes that traditional markets, the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, still represent the go-to investment areas for average investors.</p>",
