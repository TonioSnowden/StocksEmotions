  "text": "<p>Stocks have been rocked this week by concerns that an uptick in Covid-19 infections globally and a slowdown in China's growth could impede the economic recovery. Worries about rising inflation levels and the Federal Reserve's signals that it will scale back some of its easy money policiesare also weighing on sentiment. New lockdowns to contain the virus could put further pressure on supply chains, investors say.</p><p>\"We're looking at a period of very strong, but also very uneven global growth over the next couple of months,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The government reaction now looks very different across different parts of the world. If inflation does prove to be more stubborn, it could change how quickly the Fed has to tighten once they get going.\"</p><p>The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of turbulence in markets, rose to its highest level since May.</p><p>Money managers moved funds into assets that are considered safer to hold.
