  "title": "Crypto Companies Lay Off  Risk And Compliance Staff  ----  By Mengqi Sun",
  "text": "<p>   The cryptocurrency industry was until recently a finance star: institutional and individual investors poured in money, and talent flocked to the sector to share in its growth. </p><p>   Now, with the rapid drop in cryptocurrency prices, the fortunes of these companies have changed almost overnight, prompting layoffs. Some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase Global Inc. and Gemini Trust Co., have cut staff, including in risk and compliance. </p><p>   Although financial-services companies often cut compliance staff during economic downturns -- because compliance is usually seen as a function associated with costs rather than revenue generation -- compliance experts said reducing such staff at crypto companies could carry regulatory and reputational risks as the sector continues to face regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. </p><p>   \"Compliance specialists join a firm for salaries and titles and also for a good compliance culture,\" said Will Brown, an executive-search lead for financial services at Hamlyn Williams Inc., a global recruiter that focuses on regulated industries. \"If [the firm] got a reputation that they decrease compliance staff when the market gets tough, you would worry about the longevity to join the compliance staff.\" He added that can lead to more turnover in the compliance function. </p><p>   Coinbase said in June that it would cut its workforce by 1,100 employees, or about 18%, saying it had grown too quickly and a potential recession \"could lead to another crypto winter.\" </p><p>   The company created a \"talent hub\" to help laid-off employees find new positions. Individuals who listed themselves on the hub included compliance analysts, paralegals for marketing, investigations analysts, financial-crimes-investigations analysts and a compliance and anti-money-laundering manager in India. </p><p>   The crypto exchange also rescinded several job offers, including for a know-your-customer onboarding associate and compliance associates, according to the talent hub. </p><p>   \"Coinbase will never compromise on its commitment to security and compliance and continues to hire for security and compliance roles around the world,\" a spokesperson said in an email. </p><p>   The company expects to have about 5,000 full-time employees by the end of the second quarter, four times the roughly 1,250 workers it had at the end of 2020, the spokesperson said. Coinbase's risk and compliance teams \"are substantially larger today than they were at the end of 2021,\" the spokesperson said, declining to give numbers. </p><p>   Gemini cut 10% of its staff in June, citing the effects of the market downturn. Its director of business operations and intelligence, who most recently was the deputy chief compliance officer, and its head of risk departed in recent months, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Representatives for Gemini declined to comment. </p><p>   Despite the layoffs, recruiters said crypto companies' demand for legal and compliance talent continues, particularly among startups. The companies seeking compliance staff include crypto companies such as financial-technology firm MoonPay and FTX US, part of Bahamian crypto exchange FTX, as well as traditional financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. </p><p></p>",
