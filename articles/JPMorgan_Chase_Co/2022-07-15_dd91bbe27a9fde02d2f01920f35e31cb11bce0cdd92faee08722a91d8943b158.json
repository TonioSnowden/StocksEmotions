  "title": "Citigroup's Profit Falls As It Preps For Potential Loan Losses; Shares rise about 10% after revenue, profit and returns all top Wall Street expectations",
  "text": "<p>Preparations for potential bad loans in a recession pushed Citigroup Inc.'s second quarter profit down 27%, offsetting a boom in business from global companies trying to position themselves for rising interest rates.</p><p>The bank on Friday reported a profit of $4.55 billion, or $2.19 per share, compared with $6.19 billion, or $2.85 a share, a year earlier. That beat the $1.68 per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Revenue rose 11% to $19.64 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast for $18.4 billion, powered by the units that help big companies manage and move money around the globe.</p><p>Shares rose 10% to $48.69 on Friday, after a broad selloff Thursday.</p><p>Citigroup's profit was reduced by a $375 million charge to set aside funds for potential future loan losses. A year ago, the bank released $2.4 billion from its reserves, boosting profits in that period.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, which reported Thursday, took a similar $428 million reserve. The economy is flashing divergent signals about its health. Consumers and businesses remain financially strong, for the most part. But bank executives across the industry have said this week that there remains more uncertainty than normal about where the economy is headed.</p><p>\"There is broad worry around inflation, around rate increases and what that could mean for the prospects of a recession in the U.S. and Europe,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters Friday.</p><p>Mr. Mason said the bank is pausing its stock repurchases partly because of that uncertainty. Last month's stress tests on the big banks showed they all passed but many will be required to hold more capital in the coming months. \"We want to get to a more stable environment and get to those capital levels,\" Mr. Mason said of the buyback halt.</p><p>In Citi's institutional clients group, which contains its investment bank and serves corporate clients, revenue rose 20% and profit rose 16%.</p><p>Market turmoil was good for the bank's traders and good for the unit that helps big companies navigate the global economy.</p><p>Trading revenue rose 25% on a 31% increase in fixed-income trading, the dominant business for Citi's results.</p><p>Revenue rose 28% in the services and treasury and trade businesses. Volatile currency markets complicate the lives of big international companies, forcing them to bolster deposits at Citigroup and increase trading and hedging. Some big U.S. companies have recently said that the strong dollar will hurt their earnings.</p><p>Gains there were offset by a 46% drop in fees from investment banking. Deal making slowed, along with stock and bond sales, as big companies confronted their own uncertain outlooks.</p><p>Revenue in the consumer bank and wealth management operations rose 6% while its profit dropped 69% on the loan-loss reserves.</p><p>Consumers continued spending and borrowing in the quarter. Consumer spending on Citi-issued credit cards rose 16% in the quarter and balances they carried increased. Spending on commercial credit cards was up 61%.</p><p>Expenses at the bank rose 8% to $12.4 billion. Citigroup is under regulatory orders to improve its vast systems that monitor risks for the bank and its clients, a multiyear project that requires heavy spending.</p><p>Still, its return on tangible common equity, a closely watched profitability metric, hit 11.2%, far higher than the 8.8% analysts had predicted.</p><p>Citigroup has announced plans to sell international consumer businesses in an effort to simplify and focus the bank. Revenue fell and those businesses posted a loss.</p><p>Total loans fell, but increased for both big clients and consumers in businesses the bank isn't selling. The bank's profitability on lending increased thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases. Net interest margin, a gauge on lending profits, rose to 2.24% from 2.05% in the first quarter.</p><p>Bank Earnings Center</p><p>More coverage and analysis on the latest financial results from Wall Street</p><p>* JPMorgan Sees Economic Trouble Brewing</p><p>* Morgan Stanley Profit Hit by Deal Making Drop</p><p>* Wells Fargo Revenue Falls Short of Expectations</p><p>* BlackRock's Assets Decline Amid Market Downturn</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Defensive Bank Moves Aren't Whole Story</p><p>Citigroup continued slashing its exposure to Russia, where it had more business than other big rivals. The bank said it might lose as much as $2 billion on its Russia exposure in the worst-case scenario, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion it had warned was possible in April.</p><p>The bank said it is now considering \"a full range of possibilities\" on how to exit its Russia consumer and commercial banking business. The bank has been trying to sell those operations and had previously said it was in \"active dialogue\" on the sales.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup's Profit Falls As It Preps For Potential Loan Losses</p>",
