  "title": "Intel reaches $5.4 billion deal to buy Tower Semiconductor",
  "text": "<p>In premarket trade on Tuesday, Tower Semi shares jumped 47% to $48.62. Intel shares rose 2%.</p><p>Read: Semiconductor sales top half a trillion dollars for the first time, and are expected to keep growing</p><p>Tower, which makes a wide variety of chips ranging from those catering to the consumer, industrial, automotive and mobile markets, has manufacturing facilities —- called “fabs” in industry parlance — in Migdal Haemek, Israel; Agrate, Italy, Newport Beach, Calif.; and San Antonio, Texas, according to Tower's website.</p><p>Tower also owns a 51% stake in TPSCo. with Nuvoton Technology Corp. TW:4919 having a 49% stake. That partnership has three fabs in Japan that specialize in integrated circuits, more than 750 million of which have gone to the auto industry, according to Tower.</p><p>“Tower's specialty technology portfolio, geographic reach, deep customer relationships and services-first operations will help scale Intel's foundry services and advance our goal of becoming a major provider of foundry capacity globally,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO, in a statement.</p><p>Intel has pledged to build out its manufacturing capacity, earmarking up to $28 billion for 2022 back in October, and recently said it will spend more than $20 billion to build a “mega-site” fab in Ohio, as well as $20 billion for sites in Arizona. The move to build capacity has met with concern from analysts because Intel's spending is punishing the company's gross margins.</p><p>In July, Intel was reportedly seeking to acquire a then-privately owned GlobalFoundriesGFS in a deal that was estimated to be around $30 billion, but that speculation was quashed in October when GlobalFoundries filed for an initial public offering and started traded publicly on the Nasdaq Oct. 28.</p><p>Intel said the acquisition will immediately lift its adjusted earnings per share upon closing and be funded with cash from the balance sheet.</p><p>Goldman Sachs advised Intel, while JPMorgan advised Tower.</p>",
