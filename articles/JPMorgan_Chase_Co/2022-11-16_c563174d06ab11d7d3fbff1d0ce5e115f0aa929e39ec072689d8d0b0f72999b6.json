Now, the bearded tech billionaire is making a splash by taking on what once was the lifeblood of the Australian economy: coal.</p> <p>Cannon-Brookes on Tuesday won a boardroom victory over Australia's biggest polluter: coal-fired power company <strong>AGL</strong>.</p> <p>A co-founder of Australian software company <strong>Atlassian</strong>, Cannon-Brookes owns more than 11 per cent of AGL's shares. He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b50a1e3-9b86-4910-b27b-8e12893d6e15\">successfully installed</a> four of his nominees to its board in a campaign to steer it towards renewable energy.</p> <p>The new board members — including former <strong>Tesla Energy</strong> director<strong> Mark Twidell</strong> — mark the latest twist in a long-running feud between AGL and Cannon-Brookes.</p> <p>In February, Cannon-Brookes joined forces with private equity group<strong> Brookfield Asset Management</strong> in an attempt to take over the energy group. That bid failed, but he bought a minority stake in AGL and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eb3c42d-d740-460e-a8d8-a9f499f4f1ce\">successfully derailed</a> a long-planned demerger of its coal-fired plants after shareholders backed his opposition to the plan in May.</p> <p>The board coup was a “scathing indictment on those who spent years destroying shareholder value by delaying the inevitable in the face of an escalating energy transition”, said<strong> Brynn O'Brien</strong>, executive director of the<strong> Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility</strong>.</p> <p>For infrastructure investors like Brookfield, the transition to cleaner power sources is a huge opportunity for M&amp;A.</p> <p>Just last week, the Canadian alternative investment manager's Global Transition Fund, which is co-led by former Bank of England governor<strong> Mark Carney</strong>, teamed up with <strong>EIG Global Energy Partners</strong> for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbafc021-9e3e-468f-aa69-96d9491270d3\">$12bn break-up bid</a> for <strong>Origin Energy</strong>, another Australian energy company.</p> <p>The A$18.4bn ($11.8bn) offer would be one of the biggest private equity-backed buyouts of an Australian company, and open the door to more private equity opportunities in the country. <strong>Stewart Upson</strong>, Brookfield's managing partner of infrastructure, said the group planned A$20bn in additional investment in Origin's renewable capacity by 2030.</p> <p>Legacy cash flows can finance some of the investment, but the size of investments also gives alternative firms like Brookfield the chance to deploy capital in more uncertain markets. </p> <p>Carney estimated that $150tn must be invested globally by 2050 to drive decarbonisation. Brookfield and firms like <strong>KKR</strong>, <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong> and <strong>EQT</strong> are well positioned to find opportunities as economies in south-east Asia and western Europe cut their dependence on coal.</p> <p>Cannon-Brookes has won this activist battle, and he won't have to worry about fending off shareholder unrest at Atlassian, which has fallen by two-thirds over the past year. </p> <p>He and co-founder <strong>Scott Farquhar</strong> still control 88 per cent of Atlassian's voting power.</p> <h1>Chris Hohn has a few gripes with Google</h1> <p>As <strong>Twitter</strong>,<strong> Meta</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong> have been culling their ranks over the past month to defend against an economic slowdown, <strong>Google</strong> staff had a big reason to be worried.</p> <p>But the tech giant has held steady on headcount. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6daa5d29-8595-4630-a633-eb1f8b138446\">That could be about to change</a>. </p> <p>Activist investor <strong>Chris Hohn</strong>, whose firm <strong>TCI </strong>owns an approximately $6bn stake in parent company <strong>Alphabet</strong>, has called for “aggressive action” including a dramatic cut in Google's long-running investment in driverless cars and a big increase in share buybacks.</p> <p>“All of Silicon Valley has seen similar problems of having over-hired and overcompensated people and they are taking action,” Hohn told the FT's Richard Waters and Tabby Kinder. “This is a broad theme across the major tech companies that need to attack costs. But Alphabet is doing the opposite.”&#xa0;</p> <p>On top of cutting employee pay by reducing stock remuneration and other bonuses, Hohn called on Alphabet to dramatically cut&#xa0; spending on its so-called moonshot projects. That includes <strong>Waymo</strong>, the driverless car unit he says is the culprit for significant losses.</p> <p>“It's been a failure. There's no revenue model,” he said of the project.</p> <p>Hohn is limited in how far he can take his campaign. Google founders <strong>Sergey Brin </strong>and <strong>Larry Page</strong> control 51 per cent of the votes in Alphabet through a special class of voting shares, protecting them from potential proxy fights.</p> <p>Google chief executive<strong> Sundar Pichai</strong> may opt to engage with Hohn, however, since he's just saying what's on many minds.</p> <p>A hiring spree at Google's internet business, which accounts for more than 99 per cent of Alphabet's revenue, has long been a source of discontent on Wall Street — even more so this year as growth has slowed and recruiting has picked up.</p> <h1>The smart money was conservative in the third quarter</h1> <p>Analysts (and investor relations professionals) are still combing through this week's deluge of filings with the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> for disclosures that will show which stocks big money managers are betting on. </p> <p>But the early read, after a relatively tortuous year that's seen long-short equity hedge fund managers down 13.3 per cent, showed many remained disciplined. The lack of conviction in the market's direction — as interest rates surge and expectations of a recession intensify — has kept a number of high-profile managers on the sidelines.</p> <p>After a brutal year for tech shares, a number of funds slashed their positions in Facebook owner Meta. <strong>David Tepper</strong>'s <strong>Appaloosa</strong>; <strong>Philippe Laffont</strong>'s <strong>Coatue Management</strong>; and <strong>Renaissance Technologies</strong> all reduced their stakes in the social media company, while <strong>Glenview Capital Management</strong> exited altogether.</p> <p>Coatue also cut its position in <strong>Tesla</strong>, ditto <strong>Dan Sundheim</strong>'s <strong>D1 Capital Partners</strong>. </p> <p>Instead, hedge funds turned to one popular stock: <strong>Amazon</strong>. Data from Bloomberg estimated that it was the biggest increase to a single position by the fast-money crowd, with Renaissance buying more than 3mn shares. </p> <p>The downbeat positioning and sentiment among investors, who have been running relatively light on leverage this year as they've cut positions in the sell-off, might remain the case until there's substantial progress in the fight against inflation and the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> ultimately pivots. It is part of the reason <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>'s top strategist recently dialled back his optimistic bet on the US stock market.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Gibson Dunn </strong><a href=\"https://www.gibsondunn.com/gibson-dunn-promotes-37-lawyers-to-partnership/\">has promoted</a> 37 lawyers to its partnership.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Nelson Peltz</strong>, the billionaire founder of <strong>Trian Fund Management</strong>, has resigned from the board of asset manager <strong>Janus Henderson</strong>, where he and Trian co-founder <strong>Ed Garden</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6acc30d7-ae37-4d63-9379-0aeb240584e0\">took seats earlier this year</a> as part of an activist campaign.
