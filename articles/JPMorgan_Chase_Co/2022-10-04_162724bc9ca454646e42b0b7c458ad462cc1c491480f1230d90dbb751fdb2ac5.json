One credit hedge fund manager compared investors buying one-year CDS to people rushing to “buy lottery tickets”, noting the bank's incredibly strong levels of liquidity.&#xa0;</p> <p>(Credit Suisse has a liquidity coverage ratio of 191 per cent, which is significantly higher than most of its peers, as the FT's Owen Walker and Rob Smith explain in this <a href=\"http://ft.com/8e6e7255-ca94-4a82-8ca8-20fc25ef3785\">dissection</a> of the bank's balance sheet.)</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11359025.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Also, while Credit Suisse's CDS prices are now at even more elevated levels than during the 2008 financial crisis, a change to the contracts means the derivatives now reference a riskier class of debt that is more exposed to losses if the bank collapses.</p> <p>Bloomberg's Paul Davies cites these intricacies surrounding CDS in a plain-speaking column titled <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-10-03/no-credit-suisse-isn-t-on-the-brink\">“No, Credit Suisse isn't on the brink”</a>, taking aim at the “fevered typists of social media” stoking fear around the Swiss bank.</p> <p>Notably, an ABC business journalist who had sent a widely circulated tweet on Saturday suggesting that a large international investment bank was “on the brink” has now deleted the post and his employer said <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/abc-reporter-deletes-tweet-claiming-investment-bank-on-the-brink-20221003-p5bmvy\">it had reminded him</a> of its social media guidelines.</p> <p>DD does not think Credit Suisse should be given a free pass, however.&#xa0;</p> <p>The spark that ignited the social media firestorm appeared to be a Friday memo from Credit Suisse chief executive <strong>Ulrich Koerner</strong>, reassuring staff about the bank's “strong capital base and liquidity position”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Our friends at FT Alphaville noted that this was a classic example of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6104a699-fa7f-4a81-9c35-a9a2f8ff92d2\">Streisand effect</a>, whereby attempts to suppress or downplay a story have the unintended consequence of stoking it further.</p> <p>Credit Suisse already demonstrated its poor understanding of the Streisand effect earlier this year, when it demanded that hedge funds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfea0069-4143-4e4b-accb-9712ce95a282\">destroy documents</a> relating to its richest clients' yachts, following a leak to the FT that pulled back the curtain on a unit of the bank that has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a09d4e6-e3d6-40f9-903f-2771ad7e4e0a\">made loans to oligarchs</a> who were later sanctioned.</p> <p>It seems that a change in chief executive has not improved the bank's amateurish communication strategy.</p> <h1>Keeping up with the Krypto-fluencers</h1> <p>In a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/features/kardashians-hulu-kris-kim-khloe-1235198939/\">much-discussed interview</a> with Variety earlier this year,<strong> Kim Kardashian</strong> dispensed some sage advice: “Get your fucking ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.”</p> <p>US securities regulators <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a2d66be-4598-401a-b5c5-750640bb1b82\">have answered the call</a>. On Monday, the reality television star/billionaire entrepreneur agreed to pay $1.26mn to settle charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission for promoting a cryptocurrency without revealing that she was paid $250,000 to do so.</p> <p>The saga <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6dd4d6f-6a86-48cc-992c-f8a32c64fdd7\">began with an innocuous <strong>Instagram</strong> post</a>: “Are you guys into crypto????” Kardashian asked her hundreds of millions of followers last summer, directing their attention to a new coin called <strong>EthereumMax</strong>.</p> <p>“This is not financial advice,” she cautioned, including an #ad hashtag to show the post was not unprompted. The power of her celebrity was enough to move markets nonetheless.</p> <p>Kardashian's posts sent the price of EthereumMax surging, before losing 70 per cent of its value the following week. The losses were at the centre of a lawsuit alleging Kardashian and other celebrities including boxer <strong>Floyd Mayweather </strong>and former NBA player <strong>Paul Pierce </strong>helped inflate the token's price as part of a scheme that enriched its backers at the expense of other investors.</p> <p>Converting social capital into the real thing has been a tried and true strategy by Kardashian, who has leveraged her reality television and social media fame into a $1.8bn empire.</p> <p>She <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee526fad-d70d-40c6-a848-f883e1b1d380\">sold a 20 per cent stake</a> in her beauty brand <strong>KKW</strong> to cosmetics maker <strong>Coty</strong> in 2020, underscoring her ability to create big wins from her celebrity status.</p> <p>But the crypto backlash could hinder efforts at a rebranding, especially as the star <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef3a875b-9fb4-4f76-9934-6c15a0068018\">launches her private equity firm</a>, <strong>SKKY Partners</strong>, with former<strong> Carlyle </strong>partner <strong>Jay Sammons</strong>.</p> <p>Kardashian — who neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings — isn't the only celebrity that has capitalised on crypto.</p> <p>Supermodel/<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48a11dd9-a090-47ee-bd76-f69d62bb4b43\"><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried </strong>fan</a> <strong>Gisele Bündchen </strong>and her American football quarterback husband <strong>Tom Brady</strong> both have skin in the game. Actor <strong>Matt Damon</strong> has declared that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fac474e-aa34-439a-8bdb-32b576fe2687\">“fortune favours the brave”</a> — the brave being crypto investors, and former first lady <strong>Melania Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9600d12d-f9ae-4021-8dab-8807b4dfe3eb\">has taken up non-fungible tokens</a> after leaving the White House.</p> <p>SEC chair <strong>Gary Gensler </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1576897535427448832%7Ctwgr%5E2bf44782dd613a9bde644f3bb3772d4ac94ded43%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F4c42b331-1199-4f01-bcfa-c8afc15129a3\">launched a social media campaign of his own</a> advising caution on celebrity crypto endorsements, signalling that the regulator is paying close attention.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1576897535427448832%7Ctwgr%5E2bf44782dd613a9bde644f3bb3772d4ac94ded43%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F4c42b331-1199-4f01-bcfa-c8afc15129a3https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1576897535427448832%7Ctwgr%5E2bf44782dd613a9bde644f3bb3772d4ac94ded43%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F4c42b331-1199-4f01-bcfa-c8afc15129a3\">https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1576897535427448832%7Ctwgr%5E2bf44782dd613a9bde644f3bb3772d4ac94ded43%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F4c42b331-1199-4f01-bcfa-c8afc15129a3https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1576897535427448832%7Ctwgr%5E2bf44782dd613a9bde644f3bb3772d4ac94ded43%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F4c42b331-1199-4f01-bcfa-c8afc15129a3</a> <p>For Kardashian, collecting “2 and 20” private equity fees may be a more shrewd monetisation of her fame than shilling worthless coins for a $250,000 fee.</p> <h1>Byju's bad education&#xa0;</h1> <p>Online learning companies were among the companies that thrived during Covid-19 lockdowns.</p> <p>With millions of children forced out of school, teaching apps suddenly became incredibly important, and valuations soared. The pandemic helped propel interest in India's best-known online learning app, <strong>Byju's</strong>, which became the world's most valuable edtech company last year at $22bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Engineer-turned test prep tutor-turned start-up founder <strong>Byju Raveendran</strong> was expanding worldwide with a number of acquisitions. He had Silicon Valley backing from the likes of the <strong>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</strong> and <strong>Owl Ventures</strong>. Plans were made to float Byju's in the US via a special purpose acquisition company.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d998d44-3937-4931-8ee1-f963f6a8b253\">good times rarely last forever</a>, as illustrated in this Big Read from the FT's Chloe Cornish, Jyotsna Singh and Mercedes Ruehl.</p> <p>An 18-month accounting wrangle with its auditor, <strong>Deloitte</strong>, left pundits to speculate about what Byju's had to show for its pandemic fortunes. As investors waited for its filings, Byju's felt the heat from unhappy parents and media investigations into allegedly aggressive sales practices.</p> <p>Its accounts for the financial year ending in March 2021, which finally emerged last month, showed ballooning losses and flat revenues.</p> <p>Now in damage control mode, charismatic Raveendran insists the company has made mis-selling practically impossible and that revenues are rising strongly. DD will be eager to see if the numbers add up.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>has named <strong>Massimiliano Ruggieri</strong> as head of investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, succeeding <strong>Simon Smith</strong> who has been promoted to co-head global investment banking in July.
