  "text": "<p>How are stocks trading?</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 302 points, or 0.9%, to 32,946.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX dropped 63 points, or 1.5%, to 4,113.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP shed 300 points, or 2.4%, to 12,017.</p><p>On Thursday, stocks finished higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 435.05 points, or 1.3%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.7%. Friday's decline dragged all three major indexes into negative territory for the week.</p><p>Mark Hulbert: Stock-market timers have been too quick to leap into the rally â€” and that's a risky sign</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>May nonfarm payrolls rose a bigger-than-expected390,000 data, versus expectations for a gain of 328,000, from an upwardly revised gain of 436,000 in April. The unemployment rate was unchanged in May at 3.6% and average hourly earnings rose 0.3% to $31.95 in May.</p><p>While wage gains slowed slightly to 5.2% year over year from 5.5%, they likely remain \"too strong for policy makers to take their foot off the brake,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors.</p><p>\"While it does show evidence of 'peaking' inflation, it is still an uncomfortably high number. As a result, rate hikes are still going to be a headwind for markets to contend with until we see further deceleration,\" he said in emailed comments.</p><p>Investors didn't appear to be in the mood to welcome a Goldilocks set of jobs data, analysts said.</p><p>\"The jobs release sent affirmation to investors that the recovery continues in full force. The flip side to that coin, however, is that inflation will continue to be an issue due to strong demand from consumers, wage pressures, and rising commodity prices,\" said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network.</p><p>Those worries were on display in the bond market as inflation-wary investors sold Treasurys across the board, he said. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 5 basis points to 2.961%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>\"The second half of 2022 is going to be a roller-coaster ride for investors unless the Fed is able to bring inflation under control without a hard landing,\" Essele said. \"Most investors seem to be wagering on a crash-and-burn scenario at this point as recessionary fears abound, and equity markets fail to develop any sort of positive momentum.\"</p><p>In other data, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index fell to 55.9% in May from 57.1% a month earlier.</p><p>Another focus for markets on Friday was a report that Musk, according to Reuters, sent an email to executives ordering them to \"pause all global hiring,\" and that employee head count needed to be reduced by 10%. He also reportedly said he had a \"super bad feeling\" about the economy.</p><p>Weakness in Tesla TSLA shares, down 8.6%, weighed on the Nasdaq.</p><p>An increasingly gloomy tone is being heard from some corners of Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this week warned of an \"economic hurricane,\"coming due to inflation, the war in Ukraine and tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink told Bloomberg on Thursday that he expected elevated inflation for years and that \"bouts of fear\" would continue to create more market volatility.</p><p>Need to Know: Fink, Dimon and Musk have the blues. And one forecaster says they're not gloomy enough</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>* Coinbase Global Inc. COIN shares fell 9.3% after the crypto exchangeannounced an indefinite hiring freeze, a day after the billionaire Winklevoss twins announced cuts at their own crypto firm, Gemini.</p><p>* CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD shares fell 6.6% even after the security-software company reported earnings, sales and a forecast that beat expectations and boosted annual guidance.</p><p>* Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU were dragged down 0.5%, despite the company reporting sales that were better than Wall Street expected, with direct-to-consumer sales getting to be a slightly bigger chunk of the retailer's revenue.</p><p>* American Airlines Group Inc. AAL stock fell 7.2%, after the airline raised its revenue growth, but cut capacity guidance and raised its fuel-cost estimate.</p><p>* Shares of Turning Point Therapeutics Inc. TPTX more than doubled, up 116.6%, after the clinical-stage oncology company agreed to be acquired by biopharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY in an all-cash deal valuing Turning Point at about $3.77 billion. Bristol Myers shares edged up 0.1%.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>* U.S. crude CL.1 rose 1.7% to finish at $118.87 a barrel.</p><p>* The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY rose 0.3%</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD fell 3.1% to trade below $29,600.</p><p>* The Stoxx Europe 600 index XX:SXXP ended 0.3% lower, losing 0.9% for the week; London markets were closed for an extended Queen's Jubiliee bank holiday celebration.</p><p>* Markets in China and Hong Kong were also closed for a holiday.
