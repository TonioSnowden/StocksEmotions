  "text": "<p>\n  GAMESTOP CORP. </p><p>\n  GME +6.3% </p><p>\n  It's game over for GameStop's chief executive. George Sherman will leave his post by July 31, the latest in a series of changes to the videogame retailer's leadership team since Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen became a board member in January. Mr. Sherman has been leading the company since April 2019. GameStop agreed to allow Mr. Sherman to retain more than one million shares of restricted stock. That stake was worth nearly $175 million as of April 16, as part of a separation agreement disclosed Monday. GameStop shares rose 6.3% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  TESLA INC. </p><p>\n  TSLA -3.4% </p><p>\n  Tesla is facing scrutiny after a fatal crash involving one of its electric cars. U.S. safety officials are investigating the accident, in which two men died in a Tesla Model S sedan that crashed into a tree. Local authorities believe the vehicle was operating without anyone in the driver's seat. Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday tweeted that data recovered so far showed the car's advanced driver-assistance system wasn't enabled. Authorities have been investigating whether the vehicle's system was engaged at the time of the crash. Tesla shares fell 3.4% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  APPLE INC. </p><p>\n  AAPL -1.3% </p><p>\n  A podcast fight between Apple and Spotify is getting louder. Apple unveiled new products Tuesday that include a subscription podcast service. Spotify Technology SA has said it plans to launch podcast subscriptions. The music streaming company has been among Apple's most prominent corporate critics; it claims Apple uses its strength to compete unfairly -- a charge the tech giant denies. Apple shares lost 1.3% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  NETFLIX INC. </p><p>\n  NFLX -7.4% </p><p>\n  Netflix's sign-up boom is slowing down. The company's subscriber growth for the first quarter of 2021 was weaker than expected, a potential warning sign as consumers start to emerge from lockdowns and streaming competition increases. The company on Tuesday said it added another four million subscribers on a net basis globally between January and March, fewer than its forecast of six million and far below the 15.8 million increase from the same period a year earlier. It also faces more pressure from rivals like Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+. Netflix shares lost 7.4% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CO. </p><p>\n  PG +0.8% </p><p>\n  The costs of running a household are going up. This fall Procter &amp; Gamble will start charging more for household staples from diapers to tampons, citing rising costs for raw materials and higher expenses to transport goods. Global supply chains are struggling, and the February freeze that triggered mass blackouts in Texas led to a shortage in raw materials that sent prices for chemical compounds to their highest levels in years. The decision from the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent followed a similar move by rival Kimberly-Clark Corp. P&amp;G shares added 0.8% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  NESTLE SA </p><p>\n  NSRGY +2.4% </p><p>\n  Nestle sales got a jolt from consumers stuck at home. The world's biggest packaged-food company on Thursday reported its best quarterly sales growth in almost a decade, driven by strong demand for Nespresso pods, Nescafe instant coffee and Starbucks-branded products. The Swiss company made coffee a priority in recent years as part of an overhaul and it paid off as coffee drinkers looking to replicate the experience of a cafe invested in espresso machines, French presses and pour-over brewers during the pandemic. American depositary shares of Nestle rose 2.4% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO. </p><p>\n  JPM +1.9% </p><p>\n  JPMorgan Chase made a rare public apology for its role in the failed Super League. The U.S. banking giant said Friday that its financial backing for a proposed alliance of European soccer powers was a misjudgment. The effort to reshape the soccer landscape collapsed on Tuesday as six of the 12 elite clubs pulled out following ferocious outcry from fans, rival clubs, players and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. JPMorgan had pledged around $4 billion of financing to get the new Super League off the ground. JP Morgan shares rose 1.9% Friday. </p><p></p>",
