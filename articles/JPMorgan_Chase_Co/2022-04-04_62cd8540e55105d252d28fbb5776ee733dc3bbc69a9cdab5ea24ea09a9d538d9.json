  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>The EU is preparing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84b82726-d4d0-446c-a409-f61037686315\">new sanctions</a> against Russia in response to apparent atrocities in and around Kyiv, adding to existing measures including the exclusion of Russian banks from the Swift payments network, a ban on Russian airlines from EU airspace, and asset freezes against hundreds of individuals.</p> <p>Some member states have called for a ban on Russian ships using EU ports and more export restrictions, while talk of the blockbuster option — the targeting of Russian energy exports — has grown louder. </p> <p>For the first time yesterday, reports our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54b22881-60f4-47d0-a5ae-1bda69951808\">Europe Express</a> newsletter, ruling politicians in Berlin and Rome have flagged their openness to the idea, while the head of Italy's Enel, the world's second-largest utility, said the EU should have “aggressively” addressed its dependence on<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62d5a4c5-7a5b-40e3-9175-ea162939671f\"> imported gas</a> long ago. </p> <p>French president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e1670e8-c035-4cef-af59-3691414546a1\">Emmanuel Macron</a> today added his voice to calls for a ban on&#xa0;Russian oil and coal while a Brussels official said the EU would be able to cope if <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44ca2e32-7942-4873-93a1-77bbc014bf63#post-43d9c805-1de7-4c42-9d85-d564a53289bd\">Russian gas was cut off</a>. UK prime minister Boris Johnson's office said every country needed to move away from any remaining dependence on Russian hydrocarbons as “swiftly as possible”. Johnson's government is set to publish its new UK energy strategy on Thursday after several weeks of delays.</p> <p>Lithuania meanwhile has become the first EU country to actually<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efcadd5a-b192-4567-a991-56cd6fd83dae\"> end imports of Russian gas</a>.</p> <p>The EU's fifth package of sanctions is likely to tighten loopholes in existing measures and blacklist more companies and individuals. But faced with pressure at home and rising difficulties in transacting business with Russia, more than 450 companies have already pulled back or pulled out, according to the Yale School of Management, which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c292f95-fcf3-49b4-9c19-6f0177782197\">tracking the exodus</a>. </p> <p>Companies that opt to stay are paying a high price. Yale lists more than 40 brands “digging in” but for some businesses the decision is more painful than for others. </p> <p>Some, such as hoteliers and food companies, say they have a responsibility to their employees and consumers in Russia, while manufacturers fear that Moscow could nationalise businesses and assets left behind. Those that try to arrange buyouts by local management are failing to get finance because many Russian lenders have fallen under sanctions, while US and UK law firms are uncomfortable setting up the agreements. </p> <p>Many are struggling to get cash and other assets out of the country, but even assets that are mobile — such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9589574-49e4-4654-bf45-f53d090a7024\">Roman Abramovich's luxury yachts</a> — are unable to sail their way to safety.</p> <p>Sanctions can also have unforeseen consequences far away from the conflict. </p> <p>We report today that a lack of rent from VTB, Russia's largest lender, has left Libya's sovereign wealth fund — the bank's London landlord — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa8e858c-5a9d-498d-8ab6-b27c36712dfa\">out of pocket</a>. VTB is winding down its European operations after having its assets frozen, being kicked off Swift and having its membership of the London Stock Exchange suspended. </p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>All of Russia deemed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44ca2e32-7942-4873-93a1-77bbc014bf63#post-86af1c14-d1f8-4021-84d9-f8a46832848a\">‘war risk' zone</a> by marine insurance body</p></li>  <li><p>UK defends <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12c3218b-25ea-413a-883c-38f180c4bc4b\">scrapping free Covid tests</a> as list of symptoms expands</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-signals-record-quarterly-profit-oil-gas-prices-2022-04-04/\">Exxon</a> says first-quarter results could top a seven-year record (Reuters)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44ca2e32-7942-4873-93a1-77bbc014bf63\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Europe is one of the world's leading <strong>agricultural producers</strong> and a net exporter of food but is suffering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/622b9762-cfc1-4258-8cd4-bd8a7efd53fc\">severe disruption</a> from the war. The EU gets half its corn from Ukraine and a third of its fertiliser from Russia, while surging energy prices have added to the problems faced by European farmers. Official statistics showed costs rising for <strong>UK food producers</strong>, pointing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f20db79-db47-4f43-a2fd-6dd58f19a70b\">higher prices</a> for consumers.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>The UK is considering using its <strong>Covid business loans</strong> scheme as a template for permanent help for struggling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a871146e-a996-4d73-81ed-7eab20ec375a\">small businesses</a>. The focus would be on areas in the north that need “levelling up” and would complement commercial lending rather than replace it.</p> <p>Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf says UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> needs to do far more to tackle low productivity and help <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/759cf7bf-fa10-4490-a274-db1b0a89ee7b\">poorer households</a> weather a historic shock to their incomes. Sunak also needs to stop claiming he is cutting taxes when he is raising them and substituting bad taxes (national insurance) for better ones (income tax), Wolf says.</p> <p><strong>Viktor Orban</strong> easily won a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/482f9cb3-4bdd-4bf7-b776-b8c99b60aaca\">fourth consecutive term</a> as Hungary's prime minister, setting him on a collision course with the EU which has criticised his moves to erode democracy. He has also been slammed for his closeness to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman said his re-election was a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b6399dc-e1b9-4fcb-85b4-4d43a5b66de9\">warning to the west</a> and that Hungary's increasing isolation in the EU created an opportunity to put some long overdue pressure on Orban.</p> <p>New <strong>trade data</strong> highlighted the hit to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44ca2e32-7942-4873-93a1-77bbc014bf63#post-e9b13517-8079-478d-8a88-87ef27bbc6c1\">German economy</a> from the Ukraine war, while the country's main business lobby group warned of a “very bleak” outlook.</p> <p>Inflation in <strong>Turkey</strong> hit a 20-year high of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19e9541c-e0b6-4a1c-adb3-afc3f8e1a880\">61 per cent</a> as soaring energy prices added to the country's economic problems. Food costs, which make up around a quarter of Turkey's inflation basket, rose 70 per cent year on year while energy costs rose almost 103 per cent. </p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>JPMorgan Chase boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> warned of “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25675232-811b-49b7-9d8c-5e1fe11c62bd\">very volatile markets</a>” to come as the US Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy. His annual letter to shareholders is one of the most widely-read missives on Wall Street. San Francisco Fed chief <strong>Mary Daly</strong> said the case for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94f23e69-33d4-4688-b5b0-c996fa0d77f1\">half-point interest rate increase</a> at the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in May had grown.</p> <p>Economics editor Chris Giles examines whether the backlash against Russia will lead to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/279d0bf0-a58f-40c5-951f-84ecd54fe3f0\">turning point in world trade</a> and <strong>deglobalisation</strong>'s winners and losers. Princeton professor Harold James looks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c8fe679-c6ba-4948-97d4-fb0bafe90de6\">lessons from past crises</a> to argue that inflationary pressures drive innovation and change government policies, leading to more, not less, globalisation.</p> <p>The FT editorial board said US president Joe Biden's plans for a <strong>billionaire tax </strong>“looked more like a gimmick than a well-designed proposal”. The White House needed to think much more comprehensively about a tax code that has become grossly unfair and easily manipulated by the rich, it argued.</p> <p>Lockdown in <strong>Shanghai</strong>, the most significant in China since the sealing off of Wuhan at the start of the pandemic, puts paid to any notion that the country might abandon its zero-Covid policy, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11d1f525-6253-4238-b0f6-500f508ec073\">Big Read</a> explains. But it is unclear how effective the strategy might be against the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Shanghai residents are already facing shortages of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e439a10-860b-4ae6-9070-ad8546da8850\">food and medicines</a>.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> is one of the winners from the energy crisis: high coal and gas prices have helped it achieve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d6db24-eb5a-403b-ba55-7a711cd26caf\">record export earnings</a>. The incumbent government hopes the windfall will help it fend off the challenge from more climate-focused parties in next month's general election. </p> <p><strong>Pakistan </strong>faces a constitutional crisis after prime minister Imran Khan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b1707a5-29ff-49b6-85f3-0ce2e86529f9\">dismissed parliament</a> and triggered fresh elections rather than face a no-confidence vote.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>US bosses</strong> are set for record rewards this year, including large windfalls from the recent stock market rally, further widening the gap between <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f02787c1-35a8-41c4-8099-395109e49b4f\">pay at the top and the bottom</a>. Median chief executive pay jumped to a record $14.2mn in 2021, while big increases this year have included Andy Jassy's $212.7mn at Amazon — made public the same day workers in New York voted to form the company's first US trade union. </p> <p>The sell-off in <strong>tech companies</strong> that prospered during the pandemic and market uncertainties because of the war in Ukraine have rippled through to private businesses. Some 95 per cent of investors now expect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/534a9dfc-28c2-4b48-be74-4f13aa1a5992\">lower valuations</a> in the coming 12 months in what was only recently one of the fastest growing parts of the private capital industry.</p> <p><strong>India</strong>'s largest private sector bank and its biggest mortgage provider are set to merge in a $40bn deal, one of the biggest in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1503b89e-b288-40b7-ad4e-e0260248faa9\">Indian corporate history</a>. The combination of HDFC and its parent company would create an entity with a market capitalisation of $185bn and leave it well placed to take advantage of the country's economic recovery and rising demand for credit.<br><br>The global energy crisis has given new impetus to the drive for <strong>electric vehicles</strong>, but many companies are struggling with the production process, reports motor industry correspondent Peter Campbell in his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e24abfa9-4f6e-4c3f-ba2d-89e33de9b1a0\">Big Read</a>. Elon Musk's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a3123be-5ee2-41ee-8be0-8747a8284edc\">Tesla</a> is however making steady progress.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>So much for the Great Return. UK companies are losing staff quickly as <strong>Covid infection rates</strong> reach a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f1f3233-bf0a-4670-ab5a-e60a957f57b7\">record high</a>. One executive at a construction company said Covid was “spreading like wildfire . . . people are working as they need the money and reinfecting each other”.</p> <p>Those who have not succumbed to infection may have noticed their <strong>workplace canteens</strong> have moved up a notch as companies try and entice them back to the office. The catering industry is also having to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/218e50fb-9bff-4589-bff2-7975ea354456\">reinvent itself</a> as hybrid work takes away some of its traditional business and food delivery companies expand into the workplace.</p> <p>Even more tempting than fancy food is the return of the <strong>company bonding event</strong>, a phenomenon all but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da797e20-85fe-4beb-a054-c611aebfdfd9\">killed off</a> during the pandemic. EY last week flew more than 2,000 staff and their companions to Florida for a bit of corporate bonding.</p> <p>The <strong>Great Resignation</strong> may have been a little overstated, but there are definite signs that people no longer feel the need to arrange their whole life around their work, says US academic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e561d41-0267-4d40-9c30-01e62fa9c10f\">Anthony Klotz</a> who first predicted the trend. Resignation rates are likely to continue above average for two or three years, he thinks, as employers experiment with new ways of working and their staff work out what they want their futures to look like.</p> <p><em>Working It is our latest newsletter from Work &amp; Careers editor Isabel Berwick on the big ideas shaping today's workplaces, from the future of hybrid work to the effects of the Great Reshuffle. </em><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=62039b7ea31d6577a31f70df\"><em>Sign up here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Isabel and columnist Pilita Clark will also be in discussion at a Breakfast Series event in London this Wednesday (April 6) with all ticket proceeds going to the Choose Love Ukraine fundraiser. </em><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/breakfast-series-the-financial-times-presents-working-it-live-tickets-287809775787\"><em>Register here</em></a><em>.</em> </p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally...</h1> <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine is providing a crash-course in how to think about <strong>misinformation</strong>, whether deliberate or accidental.
