Greg Abbott is scheduled to make an “economic announcement” Tuesday at 5 p.m. local time.</p><p>The Taylor facility, located in central Texas, plans to create around 1,800 jobs, though chip production isn't expected to start until the end of 2024, according to documents&#xa0;Samsung KR:005930&#xa0;had previously filed with Texas authorities. To woo&#xa0;Samsung,&#xa0;Taylor had offered incentives that include the equivalent of property-tax breaks of up to 92.5% for the first 10 years, with the write-offs gradually declining over the next several decades.</p><p>“A final decision has not yet been made regarding the location,” a Samsung spokeswoman said.</p><p>Samsung's doubling down on Texas where it already has a footprint comes amid a year of historic spending for the semiconductor industry, spurred by government incentives seeking to attract local production. A global chip shortage has undercut many industries from smartphones and home appliances to cars.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Biden to nominate Jerome Powell for second term as Federal Reserve chairman.</p><p>JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Tesla's Elon Musk feud behind the scenes.</p>",
