  "title": "Macau Casinos Shut High-Roller Rooms Tied to Arrested Operator; Suncity Chairman Alvin Chau resigns, casino shares tumble again",
  "text": "<p>The shares of U.S. casino operators with subsidiaries in Macau tumbled on Wednesday amid a broader market selloff. The shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. dropped 6.11% to their lowest level in a year. Las Vegas Sands Corp. was down 4.6%. MGM Resorts International, which has comparatively less exposure to Macau than its peers and whose shares have performed significantly better this year, fell 3.23%.</p><p>On Thursday morning in Hong Kong, the shares of Wynn Macau Ltd. and Sands China Ltd. fell further and are near multiyear lows. They have plummeted this year due to Covid-19 outbreaks that have disrupted travel from mainland China and an impending regulatory overhaul that would increase government oversight of the industry.</p><p>Suncity previously facilitated a significant part of gambling revenues in the city, according to analysts, helping Macau to eclipse Las Vegas as the world's largest gambling hub before the coronavirus pandemic. Junket operators formed a core part of Macau's casino industry, attracting high rollers from mainland China by lending them money and handling the collection of any debts.</p><p>On Wednesday evening, Suncity Group Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed company controlled by Mr. Chau, said the 47-year-old chairman had resigned with effect from Dec. 1, and is also no longer an executive director of the firm. Mr. Chau was among 11 people arrested in Macau in recent days after mainland police issued a warrant for his arrest.</p><p>Macau is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Police in the enclave on Sunday said a group led by Mr. Chau had used a VIP gambling business in Macau to establish gambling platforms overseas and solicited residents in mainland China to engage in illicit gambling activities online.</p><p>Suncity Group's shares have plunged by more than 50% this week. In a regulatory filing, the company said: \"The Group has not been carrying on any VIP business in Macau.\"</p><p>It added that \"such business has been carried on\" by a similarly named company called Sun City Gaming Promotion Co., which is wholly owned by Mr. Chau. This company also supplied \"hotel accommodation products\" to the group, a practice that was stopped on Dec. 1, Suncity said. Because of that and the recent spread of the Covid-19 Omicron variant, the company has suspended its travel and related business operations, Suncity said.</p><p>The VIP business was the biggest source of government tax revenue in Macau until 2018, contributing more than 60% of total gambling revenue, Morgan Stanley said in a Nov. 29 note. In 2019, the segment contributed 38% of total gambling revenue, and junkets helped bring in the bulk of that, according to the investment bank's estimates.</p><p>Before the pandemic, the overall VIP business—the majority of which came from Chinese tourists—made up about one-fifth of Wynn Macau's property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, making the casino operator more exposed to the VIP segment than its counterparts, according to Morgan Stanley's estimates.</p><p>So far this year, Suncity has accounted for 24% of VIP gambling revenues and just 6% of the total pie, according to research analysts from J.P. Morgan. The key question for the industry, it added, is whether this is an isolated incident for the firm \"or a broader crackdown on the junket system as a whole.\" Any potential spillover effects to the mass market also remain to be seen.</p><p>\"It's probably reasonable to assume junket VIP revenue would go to near-zero levels ultimately,\" the firm said, adding the message from the government is clear, in that such proactive gambling promotion for mainland Chinese citizens \"will not be tolerated.\"</p><p>Yi Wei Wong and P.R.
