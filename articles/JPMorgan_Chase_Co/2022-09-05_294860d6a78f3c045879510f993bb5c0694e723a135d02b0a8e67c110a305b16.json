  "text": "<p>Opec+ agreed on Monday to cut crude supply in a bid to prop up oil prices, defying calls from western governments battling to curb inflation in the face of a mounting global energy crisis.</p> <p>The producer group will cut 100,000 barrels a day from supply from October, reversing an earlier increase of the same amount agreed last month following a visit to Jeddah by US president Joe Biden. </p> <p>While traders said the amounts were relatively tiny in the global oil market, where demand is about 100mn b/d, the signal to Washington and the energy sector was more powerful: Opec and its allies, including Russia, will move to defend oil prices.</p> <p>“This has a political dimension — Russia wants to make the west pay for the sanctions it has imposed on Moscow,” said Bill Farren-Price, a director at consultancy Enverus. “What better way than to get its Opec+ partners to start tightening the oil market. Biden's hopes for some sort of accommodation with Saudi Arabia now look naive.”</p> <p>The policy reversal from Opec+ marks an end to months of supply increases during a rally that took Brent crude close to a record high earlier this year following <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>But a sell-off in recent weeks pushed Brent back below $100 a barrel, amid growing fears of recession in Europe and weaker oil demand from China. Sharp price falls last week prompted calls for cuts from some Opec+ members. Brent was up 4 per cent on Monday in London after the meeting, trading at $96.60 a barrel. </p> <p>Matthew Holland, geopolitical analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects, said the cut was at least partly designed to “show the market that the group will act to support prices if they look like collapsing”.</p> <p>But analysts said the cut carried geopolitical weight that went beyond the oil price, coming just days after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81e74eb3-c191-4391-8e0a-35a93dc8d971\">G7 countries agreed to impose a price cap </a>on Russian oil exports and hours after Moscow confirmed it would keep a major natural gas pipeline to Europe shut until western sanctions on the country were lifted. </p> <p>The Opec+ cut decision also comes as the US and other countries close in on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/004f0d5a-0eca-4ea0-a423-0184481d033c\">a nuclear deal with Iran</a>, which would end sanctions on its oil sector and allow a rise in supply.</p> <p>“It is a message to the US and international community . . . ‘Don't think we're going to sit back if consumers keep trying to intervene in the market, be that with price caps, releases of strategic stocks, or trying to bring Iran back to the market',” said Raad Alkadiri at Eurasia Group.</p> <p>A statement from the cartel after the meeting said that “higher volatility and increased uncertainties require the continuous assessment of market conditions and a readiness to make immediate adjustments to production in different forms, if needed”.</p> <p>The White House said Biden “has been clear that&#xa0;energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth” but it did not address the Opec+ production cut directly.&#xa0;</p> <p>Christyan Malek, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the decision marked a “new era” for Opec+, which would intervene in future “on a Fed-like basis in a more dynamic way”.</p> <p>But the decision will also raise alarm as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/88f84738-6118-46ea-bb9b-261f65752142\">energy crisis</a> deepens in Europe, where soaring natural gas and electricity prices threaten to send the continent deep into recession. </p> <p>In the US, Biden has battled for months to drive down soaring petrol prices, with the White House repeatedly lobbying Saudi Arabia to increase crude supply. </p> <p>The US and other western countries have for months been supplying the market with crude from emergency stockpiles — a move that analysts believe helped prevent a more severe price surge after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion earlier this year. </p> <p>People familiar with Saudi oil policy said Monday's decision also reflected the kingdom's concern that prices had become detached from the fundamentals of supply and demand at a time of volatility in energy markets. </p> <p>Saudi Arabian oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman had warned last week that a cut was a possibility given what he said was a disconnect between financial and physical oil markets.</p> <p>Analysts said the kingdom was keen to prop up the price and had concerns that the oil market had become complacent. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Felicia Schwartz in Washington</em></p><p>Source: Derek Brower in New York and David Sheppard in London 2022 'Opec+ agrees cut in crude supply in push to lift oil prices' FT.com 5 September.
