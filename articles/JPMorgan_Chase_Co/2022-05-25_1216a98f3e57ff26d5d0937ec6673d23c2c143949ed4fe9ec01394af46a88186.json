  "text": "<p>The U.S. gradually has limited Russia's access to foreign credit since the invasion. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had said the U.S. likely would let the exemption for Americans receiving debt payments expire.</p><p>Russia has stayed current on around $2.5 billion of foreign debt payments since the conflict in Ukraine began, largely by relying on that exemption and using unsanctioned Russian banks to send payments. Without it in place, Russia will be unable to have U.S.-based financial intermediaries process bond payments on its behalf.</p><p>Russia faces about $235 million in payments due under some of its dollar-denominated bonds on June 23, and $159 million due June 24, said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. research. The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
