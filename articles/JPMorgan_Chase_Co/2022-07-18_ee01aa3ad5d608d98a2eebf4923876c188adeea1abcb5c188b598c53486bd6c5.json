  "title": "Bank of America Revenue Rises on Consumer Strength, but Profit Declines 32%; 'The consumer's in great shape,' CFO says",
  "text": "<p>Revenue increased 6% from a year ago to $22.7 billion, roughly in line with expectations.</p><p>Bank of America released $48 million in funds it had set aside to cover potential future losses. A year ago, the bank released $2.2 billion. That, along with a $2 billion one-time gain, lifted its profit at the time.</p><p>Quarterly earnings from the nation's biggest banks are being closely watched for signs that the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation with interest-rate increases are tipping the economy into a recession. While the biggest U.S. banks posted double-digit drops in profit, their results showed little evidence of a downturn. U.S. consumers, especially, appear to be in good financial shape, spending at a healthy clip and keeping up with their debt payments.</p><p>At Bank of America, executives said, customers have upped their spending while maintaining elevated deposit balances. Credit card spending rose 17%. Loan balances also increased.</p><p>\"Despite the worries of a slowing economyâ€¦our customers' resilience and health remains strong,\" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on a call with analysts Monday.</p><p>Bank of America's shares rose in morning trading before paring most of their gains by the close. They settled up less than 0.1% at $32.26. The bank's shares are down 28% this year, compared with a 20% drop in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Bank of America's U.S. customers are spending more on services and less on goods, Mr. Moynihan said. Customers spent 41% more on travel and entertainment in the second quarter than they did a year ago. They are also paying more for fuel, spending 42% more on gas.</p><p>Default rates remain near record lows, and customers are \"paying off their debt at a good clip,\" Mr. Moynihan said.</p><p>\"The consumer's in great shape, and the Fed's got a lot of work to do,\" Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America's chief financial officer, said.</p><p>Bank of America's net interest income, including its lending profit, rose 22% from a year earlier to $12.4 billion, thanks largely to higher rates and stronger demand for loans.</p><p>Noninterest income, which includes fees, fell 9% from a year earlier to $10.2 billion. Lower investment-banking fees and changes to the bank's overdraft policy dragged down fee income, Bank of America said. The bank said in January it would cut overdraft fees from $35 to $10.</p><p>Investment banking fees fell 46% from a year earlier to $1.2 billion. Investment banking revenue fell 54% at JPMorgan, 55% at Morgan Stanley and 46% at Citigroup in the second quarter.</p><p>Bank of America's adjusted trading revenue increased 11% to about $4 billion.</p><p>Outstanding loans and leases grew 12% from a year earlier to just over $1 trillion. Loans in the bank's commercial division rose 16%. That is positive news for a bank that, like its peers, struggled to profit from lending for much of the pandemic because of rock-bottom interest rates and tepid loan demand.</p><p>Mortgage originations fell to $14.5 billion in the second quarter, down from $20.3 billion a year ago. Rising interest rates have sapped refinancing demand and are starting to weigh on purchases, a challenge for large banks' mortgage businesses. Last week, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan reported drops of 36% and 45% in mortgage originations, respectively.</p><p>Bank of America's total expenses increased 1.5% to $15.3 billion. That amount includes about $425 million for costs related to regulatory matters. Last week, federal regulators fined Bank of America $225 million, saying the bank had mishandled the distribution of unemployment benefits at the height of the pandemic. The bank said last week that it worked with government clients \"to identify and fight fraud throughout the pandemic.\"</p><p>The bank set aside about $200 million for charges related to employees' unauthorized use of personal phones. The bank hopes to settle in the coming weeks, Mr. Borthwick said. JPMorgan paid $200 million in a similar settlement last year. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup said last week they had set aside money for similar matters.</p><p>Write to Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Bank of America Revenue Rises on Consumer Strength, but Profit Declines 32%</p>",
