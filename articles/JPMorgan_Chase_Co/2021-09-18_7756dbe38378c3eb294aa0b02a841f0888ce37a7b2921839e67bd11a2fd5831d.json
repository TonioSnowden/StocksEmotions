  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Rick McVey --- Chairman and Chief Executive, MarketAxess",
  "text": "<p>Yet that experience gave the former futures trader confidence to launch MarketAxess Holdings Inc. four years later. Mr. McVey's startup grew into the dominant online marketplace for trading corporate bonds.</p><p>The New York company facilitated $6.6 trillion in trading during 2020.</p><p>It offers venues and tools for banks, investment managers and others to trade electronically.</p><p>Upon completing business school in 1983, Mr. McVey worked as a futures trader at two institutions. J.P. Morgan recruited him to run its Chicago futures operations in 1992. Four years later, he moved to New York for what he still calls his \"huge stretch opportunity\" with the fixed-income role.</p><p>\"The one time I took a career risk that scared the hell out of me was that job,\" the now-62-year-old CEO adds.</p><p>J.P. Morgan and other banks backed his creation of MarketAxess in 2000. His former employer also gave the startup free office space -- with mismatched furniture.</p><p>Here are four of his trusted advisers.</p><p>Nicolas Rohatyn</p><p>CEO and founder of Rohatyn Group</p><p>Mr. Rohatyn supervised Mr. McVey in the late 1990s. When his J.P. Morgan lieutenant devised the idea for MarketAxess, Mr. Rohatyn marshaled extensive internal support for the new business. Nevertheless, he was surprised Mr. McVey would take such a significant career and financial risk. Mr. Rohatyn says he warned the budding entrepreneur that \"survival was far from assured.\" Amid MarketAxess's difficult early days, Mr. McVey often turned to his prior boss for guidance. \"Stay focused on what you can control,\" including costs, he recollects Mr. Rohatyn suggesting.</p><p>Carlos Hernandez</p><p>Executive chair of investment and corporate banking for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>The men became close colleagues in 1996. Mr. Hernandez accepted a MarketAxess board seat in 2006. \"He became our most optimistic champion\" during the financial crisis, Mr. McVey remembers. Mr. Hernandez correctly insisted that the company would flourish as credit markets recovered and bank regulation increased. Around six years ago, Mr. Hernandez proposed that MarketAxess promote itself more aggressively. Mr. McVey hired a chief marketing officer with extensive Wall Street experience. Over two years, revenue rose 18%.</p><p>Richie Prager</p><p>A former senior managing director of BlackRock Inc.</p><p>Mr. Prager has talked regularly with Mr. McVey since joining BlackRock, a MarketAxess client, in 2008. In 2013, they created a strategic alliance that allowed certain BlackRock clients to trade corporate bonds directly with each other through MarketAxess. The platform connects clients as disparate as Midwestern insurers and South African hedge funds. Mr. Prager counseled Mr. McVey about how he could accelerate big banks' acceptance of the system. \"He helped me to get the banks more comfortable with the change,\" Mr. McVey says.</p><p>Nancy Altobello</p><p>Professional board member</p><p>In 2019, Mr. McVey sought advice from the newest MarketAxess board member about managing his rapidly expanding workforce. \"I encouraged him to put talent at the top of the list of strategic priorities,\" Ms. Altobello recollects. As global vice chair of talent for Ernst &amp; Young until 2018, she led such strategies for more than 250,000 EY staffers. Mr. McVey expanded the board compensation committee's duties to cover talent companywide, rather than just executive pay. Nowadays, Ms. Altobello frequently coaches the longtime CEO about succession planning.</p>",
