  "title": "Finance & Markets:  Goldman CEO Is Preparing for a Recession  ---  Solomon expects  stocks to be lower  a year from now; 35%  chance of soft landing  ----  By AnnaMaria Andriotis",
  "text": "<p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive David Solomon signaled that the firm will likely have to trim its operations as it deals with a slowing economy. </p><p>   Mr. Solomon, speaking Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit, said the idea shouldn't come as a surprise given how closely the firm's growth is correlated with the global economy. He also noted that the banking industry hired aggressively during the pandemic deal-making boom of 2020 and 2021. </p><p>   \"It's a natural phenomenon that you therefore have to trim in some areas and pull back, and so we're going through the process of thinking about how we're going to do that,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"But for sure, we'll have to narrow our footprint a little bit.\" </p><p>   A foundering stock market, the war in Ukraine and the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking campaign against inflation have pushed many corporate chieftains to the sidelines this year. Many who were thinking about acquisitions or IPOs when they entered 2022 are now waiting to see what the next months bring. </p><p>   The deal-making slump has sent profits down across the board at banks, including Goldman. The Wall Street giant in October announced a broad restructuring intended to make the firm less reliant on the boom-and-bust businesses of deal making and trading. </p><p>   Mr. Solomon said Tuesday that he expected stocks and residential real estate to be lower a year from now. He gave a 35% chance of a \"soft landing,\" in which the Fed can curb inflation without pushing the U.S. into recession. </p><p>   But there is also \"a very, very reasonable possibility that we could have a recession of some kind,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Solomon also cited growth in government debt around the world as a potential risk. </p><p>   In October, third-quarter results across the banking industry showed that individuals and businesses are still borrowing at a healthy rate -- for now. </p><p>   But Mr. Solomon and other bank chiefs, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, sounded a warning then that things could get worse. Goldman officials cautioned then that they were seeing cracks in consumers' ability to handle their debts. </p><p></p>",
