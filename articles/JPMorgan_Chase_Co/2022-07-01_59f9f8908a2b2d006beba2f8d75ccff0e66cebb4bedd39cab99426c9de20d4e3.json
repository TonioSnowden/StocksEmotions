  "title": "Business News:  Crypto Fund  Three Arrows  Draws Fire  ----  By Caitlin Ostroff and Margot Patrick",
  "text": "<p>   Singapore's top financial regulator reprimanded the cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, saying it supplied false information to officials and managed more assets than allowed. </p><p>   The firm, which was recently ordered to liquidate by a court in the British Virgin lslands, previously gave false or misleading information to regulators when it transferred management of its fund in September 2021 to an entity in the offshore tax haven, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said Thursday. In doing so, Three Arrows didn't disclose that one of its founders was a common shareholder in both entities. </p><p>   Three Arrows operated as a regulated fund manager in Singapore starting in 2013. Last year, it shifted its domicile to the British Virgin Islands as part of a plan to relocate its operations to Dubai. </p><p>   Filings in the British Virgin Islands show that Three Arrows drew on a network of international banks during the years before its collapse. </p><p>   Banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and ABN Amro Bank NV had charges over Three Arrows in the British Virgin Islands for lending facilities and prime brokerage agreements, according to filings with the BVI Financial Services Commission. A charge is a disclosure companies are required to make when borrowing money or opening a line of credit. </p><p>   The filings were published by Offshore Alert, a website focused on unearthing hard-to-obtain corporate filings. </p><p>   A lawyer for Three Arrows Capital declined to comment. </p><p>   People familiar with the matter said the facilities with JPMorgan and Bank of America aren't active and the banks don't have money at risk. </p><p>   An ABN Amro spokesperson declined to comment. </p><p>   Singapore's United Overseas Bank had a margin lending agreement with Three Arrows from March 2018 that ended in April 2019, according to the filings. A spokesperson from UOB wasn't available to comment. </p><p>   Crypto lender BlockFi also had a charge over assets of Three Arrows that most recently was amended June 17, according to the filings. A spokeswoman for BlockFi said that the firm liquidated or hedged its exposure to Three Arrows in June. </p><p>   Hedge funds rely on prime brokerage units of banks to borrow money and amplify potential gains on their investments. The prime brokerage units also help hedge funds execute trades, buying and selling assets on their behalf. </p><p>   The documents don't detail whether Three Arrows used any of the borrowing relationships to invest in cryptocurrencies. Wall Street banks have tiptoed when it comes to handling cryptocurrencies directly, waiting for more regulatory clarity. </p><p>   The hedge fund originally started off trading emerging-markets currencies, stocks and other traditional financial assets before investing heavily into cryptocurrencies a few years ago. Three Arrows' co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies had previously worked as Wall Street currency traders. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Serena Ng contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
