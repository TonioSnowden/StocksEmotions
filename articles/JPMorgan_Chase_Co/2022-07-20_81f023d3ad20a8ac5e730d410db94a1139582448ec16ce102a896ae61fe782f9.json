  "title": "Sixth Street Leads $600 Million Investment in Contentsquare; The transaction values the Paris-based customer experience analytics firm at $5.6 billion",
  "text": "<p>Contentsquare's artificial intelligence-powered technology helps clients across sectors, from Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc. to German automaker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, or BMW, analyze and respond to the behavior of customers on websites and mobile apps.</p><p>The company analyzes some 3.2 trillion customer interactions a month to create what it calls \"more human\" digital experiences.</p><p>\"Today, the digitalization of the world is touching every industry,\" Contentsquare founder and Chief Executive Jonathan Cherki said. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated consumer use of technology to interact with companies, he added.</p><p>\"The digital experience market's potential is expansive and still in the early innings of adoption,\" said Bo Stanley, a Sixth Street partner who is co-head of Sixth Street Growth. \"We believe the best companies use times of uncertainty to build value by investing in their products and markets, and that's what Contentsquare is doing and why we are investing.\"</p><p>Contentsquare's technology focuses on customer intent rather than identity or other personal information, Mr. Cherki said. For example, the company offers clients \"cookieless analytics\" that zero in on the experience of their customers without attaching digital tags that let internet and advertising companies follow users.</p><p>\"You do not need to choose between privacy and personalization,\" Mr. Cherki said.</p><p>Mr. Cherki started to work on what would become Contentsquare while studying at ESSEC Business School near Paris. Founded in 2012, the company has since grown to employ around 1,500 people, including more than 400 in research and development roles, working from 17 locations worldwide.</p><p>Contentsquare will use the latest cash infusion to expand both product offerings and the company's geographic reach as well as for investments in accessibility, privacy and sustainability.</p><p>Mr. Cherki sees growth opportunities through acquisitions as well. Contentsquare acquired six operations in the past three years, including last September's purchase of Hotjar Ltd.—a provider of analytics and customer-feedback tools—to broaden its offerings for small and midsize businesses.</p><p>The latest investment round brings the total that backers have committed to the business to around $1.4 billion, including the $500 million round led by SoftBank last year. San Francisco-based Sixth Street, the former credit arm of private-equity firm TPG Inc., invested through its growth strategy.</p><p>Backers of the $200 million debt component included BNP Paribas SA, Crédit Agricole SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Société Générale SA.</p><p>Laura Cooper contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p>",
