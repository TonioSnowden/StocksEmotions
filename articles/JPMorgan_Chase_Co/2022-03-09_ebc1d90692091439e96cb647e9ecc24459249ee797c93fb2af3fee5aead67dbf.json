  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Europe Moves to Diversify Its Sources of Energy  ----  By Kim Mackrael and Paul Hannon",
  "text": "<p>   BRUSSELS -- The European Union said it plans to store more natural gas and diversify its sources, aiming to cut its imports of Russian supplies by two-thirds by the end of this year. </p><p>   The invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Europe's dependence on energy imports from Russia, which last year accounted for about 40% of its natural-gas consumption. The EU has been under pressure to come up with a plan to survive next winter if Russian supplies are cut off, either by Moscow or because of damage to pipelines that run across Ukraine. </p><p>   \"We must become independent from Russian oil, coal and gas,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. \"We simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us.\" </p><p>   In a document released Tuesday, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said its plan could end the bloc's dependence on Russian gas entirely before 2030. The EU also plans to quickly add more renewable energy sources and reduce consumption to help get through this year. </p><p>   Europe has enough gas to get through the rest of this winter. The issue is preparing for the next heating season, said Thomas Pellerin-Carlin, director of the Paris-based Jacques Delors Energy Centre. \"The question is what can we do during the next nine months to make sure that we can survive the next winter while being warm enough,\" he said. </p><p>   The shift away from Russian energy could cost governments as much as they spent tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, economists at JPMorgan said in a note to clients Tuesday. They estimate that government debt in the EU rose by around $1.5 trillion because of the pandemic. </p><p>   Countries typically store natural gas during the summer and fall and then run down their storage while bringing in new supplies during the winter. Europe uses natural gas for heating and electricity, so a hot summer with high energy demand could make it harder to fill storage. Another challenge will be finding supply during the summer to fill storage. </p><p>   The new plan calls for the EU to bring its average natural-gas storage level to at least 90% of capacity by the beginning of October. A storage level of 90% equates to about 1,000 terawatt hours, which should be enough to get the EU through the winter without imports from Russia. To get by, the EU would rely on very high imports of non-Russian gas and liquefied natural gas throughout the winter, said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. </p><p>   Europe entered the heating season last year with storage levels at around 75%, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe, which analysts said left it more vulnerable. </p><p>   The commission said it is looking for ways to soften the economic blow from higher energy prices, including the possibility of temporary limits on electricity prices, and waiving EU rules that limit the help governments can give businesses to allow them to \"support companies and sectors severely impacted by the current geopolitical developments.\" </p><p></p>",
