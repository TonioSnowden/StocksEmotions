  "title": "OPEC+ To Boost Output In Nod To U.S. --- Move unlikely to cut pump prices; recent Saudi actions pave way for Biden visit",
  "text": "<p>Both moves were sought by the U.S. and helped set the stage for Mr. Biden to visit Saudi Arabia later this month as the president looks to set aside longstanding divisions with the kingdom amid high oil and gasoline prices that have driven inflation. While the visit hasn't been officially announced, Thursday's moves create momentum for the president's trip.</p><p>There were signs that the new oil-output plan wouldn't cool an oil market that shot above $100 barrel for the first time in eight years after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and has stayed above that level since. WTI, the benchmark for U.S. crude prices, rose after the increase was announced, trading up about 1% at almost $117 a barrel on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Under the agreement Thursday between the 13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 non-OPEC producers led by Russia, the group known as OPEC+ will raise output by 648,000 barrels a day in July and in August. That increases OPEC+'s production about 50% more than previously planned, but it is unlikely to meet its targets, said Giovanni Staunovo, an oil-market analyst at UBS.</p><p>Most of the group's members are already pumping at full capacity and can't pump more, Mr. Staunovo said, with only the Saudis and a few others able to open the taps more.</p><p>Economists have been watching energy and food prices closely since the Ukraine invasion, as high inflation and slow growth raise fears that the global economy could enter a period of so-called stagflation.</p><p>Christyan Malek, head of oil and gas equity research at JPMorgan, said the agreement is unlikely to bring significantly more oil production from the group or lower oil prices.</p><p>\"It's like the group is firing rubber bullets at the oil market,\" he said. \"It's a cosmetic increase.\"</p><p>Further undercutting confidence in the plan, the agreement assumes Russia will increase its output by 170,000 barrels a day from July, though its output has fallen 700,000 barrels a day under Western sanctions and is expected to fall even further after the European Union agreed to impose a partial ban on Russian oil purchases. While Russian exports have held up over that time, some OPEC officials believe it will be difficult for Russia to keep pumping at the same level after the EU move.</p><p>Russia is one of the world's three largest oil producers, along with Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Before the invasion, it pumped 11.3 million barrels a day, about 11% of global supplies.</p><p>Even if the OPEC+ plan doesn't immediately address high oil prices, it had symbolic value for the Biden administration, which has been trying to reset relations with Saudi Arabia. There had been a flurry of diplomacy between Washington and Riyadh, with senior U.S. officials traveling to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks, and Mr. Biden and his aides on Thursday quickly praised the Saudi moves.</p><p>\"This truce [in Yemen] also would not have been possible without cooperative diplomacy from across the region,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement.</p><p>White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre welcomed the OPEC+ decision and praised Saudi Arabia's leadership.</p><p>Dan Shapiro, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who now serves as a distinguished fellow in the Atlantic Council's Middle East programs, said the moves are a clear sign the president is poised to visit Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\"It sounds like things are falling into place,\" he said. \"These are the elements that they needed. Biden could only go if he got commitments from Saudis on oil production and broader issues.\"</p><p>A senior White House official wouldn't say whether Mr. Biden plans to visit Saudi Arabia but said that if the president decides \"it's in the interests of the United States to engage with a foreign leader and that such an engagement can deliver results, then he'll do so.\"</p><p>A decision to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would mark a reversal for Mr. Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Saudi Arabia for its human-rights record and for the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As candidate in 2020, Mr. Biden said he would \"make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are.\"</p><p>Some fellow Democrats have urged Mr. Biden to maintain a tough line on Saudi Arabia because of human-rights concerns, and because they would rather the U.S. move away from its reliance on fossil fuels rather than make ethically questionable compromises to get more oil from the Saudi regime.</p><p>The moves on oil represent a shift for the Saudis, who had resisted calls from the U.S., U.K. and other Western countries to pump more oil.</p><p>According to Persian Gulf officials familiar with the discussions, the Saudis would consider increasing their oil output more than planned if Russian output continues to decline. Their decision would also depend on Mr. Biden's potential visit, the officials said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and another major Gulf OPEC producer, the United Arab Emirates, say they want Washington to beef up their security after a string of attacks by Yemeni rebels and threats by Iran.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
