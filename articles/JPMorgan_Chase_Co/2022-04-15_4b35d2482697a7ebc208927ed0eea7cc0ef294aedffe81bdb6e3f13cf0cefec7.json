  "title": "Biden to Nominate Michael Barr as Top Fed Banking Regulator; If confirmed, former Obama Treasury official would oversee the largest U.S. financial firms",
  "text": "<p>If confirmed, Mr. Barr would serve as the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, charged with overseeing the largest U.S. financial firms including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. A key architect of the 2010 Dodd-Frank postcrisis financial regulatory overhaul and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mr. Barr would likely bring close scrutiny to bank mergers and rules for lending in low-income neighborhoods.</p><p>First, though, Mr. Barr would need to win confirmation in the 50-50 Senate, where many Republicans are expected to line up against him. If all GOP senators oppose him, he would need to win the support of every Senate Democrat, including centrists and progressives, a task that has proved challenging for some of Mr. Biden's previous nominees to top financial regulatory posts.</p><p>Mr. Biden's first pick for the top Fed banking job, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew her nomination after pivotal centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) opposed her because of her views on climate change. Unlike Ms. Raskin, Mr. Barr hasn't called on the Fed to take an active role in addressing climate change, a difference that some observers think will help him win the support of centrists.</p><p>Mr. Barr has faced skepticism among some progressives, who have said that Obama-era efforts to protect homeowners from foreclosure didn't go far enough. Amid that criticism, the White House passed over Mr. Barr for another top regulatory job, Comptroller of the Currency, and ultimately selected a different nominee, Saule Omarova, a Cornell University law professor. Ms. Omarova withdrew after several centrist Democrats challenged her views on bank oversight and addressing climate change.</p><p>After Ms. Raskin's and Ms. Omarova's withdrawals at the hands of Republicans and centrist Democrats in the Senate, some banking experts see Mr. Barr's nomination as a White House tack toward the center.</p><p>\"Certainly the political winds have shifted,\" said Jesse Van Tol, the president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, who supports Mr. Barr's nomination. \"There's a sense that perhaps there was an overreach in terms of what was possible. I mean, after all, the political calculus is 50 votes in the Senate.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden said in a statement that Mr. Barr \"has strong support from across the political spectrum.\" The president said Mr. Barr \"understands that this job is not a partisan one, but one that plays a critical role in regulating our nation's financial institutions to ensure Americans are treated fairly and to protect the stability of our economy.\"</p><p>Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said he had concerns about Mr. Barr, adding that he looked forward to considering his nomination.</p><p>\"Michael Barr has defended Dodd Frank's big-bank bailout mechanism, which enshrined into law taxpayer bailouts of banks. He was also the primary author of the unconstitutional and unaccountable CFPB,\" he said. The Supreme Court ordered changes to the bureau's structure in 2020 after finding its director held too much power.</p><p>Mr. Barr, currently the dean of the University of Michigan's public policy school, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a top progressive on the Senate Banking Committee, said she intended to support Mr. Barr's nomination, as did Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio.), the chairman of the panel. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), a progressive who helped craft the Dodd Frank Act, however, said in a statement that he was undecided.</p><p>\"I'm not going to make up my mind about this nomination until I have a chance to sit down with Mr. Barr,\" Mr. Merkley said.</p><p>Without a vice chairman for supervision, the Fed's board of governors still votes on regulatory matters, but lacks a designated leader focused on those issues.</p><p>The absence of a Senate-confirmed leader at any of the top roles at the Fed, OCC or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has worried advocates for tighter regulation. They fear that Democrats are losing an opportunity to put their imprint on key questions like how to address the risks presented by climate change.</p><p>If confirmed, Mr. Barr would face the question of whether and how to reverse regulatory changes during the Trump administration, when the central bank eased the financial rulebook for Wall Street, lowering capital and other cash-management requirements for U.S. lenders with less than $700 billion in assets, for example.</p><p>Analysts said Mr. Barr would review the Trump-era rules, but not necessarily reverse all of them.</p><p>\"The idea that Michael Barr is going to be a bogeyman for industry, I have not seen evidence of,\" said Paul Thornell, a lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen &amp; Thomas whose clients include financial-services firms. He said Mr. Barr \"could have very easily put in motion colossal changes to the largest financial institutions that would have wound them down, nationalized them, taken over assets, and that is not the product that came out of Dodd Frank.\"</p><p>The Financial Services Forum, made up of chief executive officers from the eight largest American banks, issued a statement congratulating Mr. Barr on the nomination. \"We look forward to hearing Mr. Barr's current views on the state of the banking system and to working with him if confirmed,\" the forum's president, Kevin Fromer, said in the statement.</p><p>In addition to serving as assistant treasury secretary for financial institutions during the Obama administration, Mr. Barr worked in multiple roles during the Clinton administration, including special assistant to then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and deputy assistant Treasury secretary.</p><p>Some progressives have raised concerns about Mr. Barr's previous ties to financial-technology firms Ripple Labs Inc. and LendingClub Corp., arguing that they could conflict with his role as a regulator.</p><p>In 2015, Mr. Barr joined the advisory board of Ripple Labs, a cryptocurrency company now defending itself in court against charges filed in late 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it violated federal securities laws. He left the advisory board in 2017.</p><p>Ripple was started in 2012 by one of the creators of a cryptocurrency called XRP. According to the SEC's lawsuit, the company and its founders initially controlled 100% of the supply of XRP. They then began selling the tokens to speculative investors to fund Ripple's operations and in hopes of building a market for XRP that would make the cryptocurrency useful for purposes such as cross-border payments.</p><p>Ripple and its founders received legal advice as far back as 2012 that XRP could constitute a security under federal law, the SEC alleged. Nevertheless, they accelerated their sales of the token in the following years, raising at least $1.39 billion through the third quarter of 2020.</p><p>Ripple disputes the SEC's allegation that XRP is an investment that falls under the agency's jurisdiction.</p><p>A White House official said Mr. Barr is proud of his work with Ripple, which consisted of consulting on how to lower the cost of remittances for low-income people and people in the developing world. At LendingClub, the official said, Mr. Barr advised the company on consumer protection, fair-lending practices and the Community Reinvestment Act.</p><p>Mr. Barr is \"a believer in the supervision of all financial sectors, and he supports appropriate regulation for cryptocurrency and strong consumer protections,\" the official added.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com, Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com and Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com</p><p>Biden to Nominate Michael Barr as Top Fed Banking Regulator</p>",
