  "text": "<p>The drugs are effective for both diabetes and obesity because they promote production of hormones in the body that tell people they are full after eating and stimulate insulin secretion, in turn lowering blood-sugar levels, doctors and the companies say.</p><p>A new study showed that an Eli Lilly drug, tirzepatide, helped obese people who didn't have diabetes lose up to 22.5% of their body weight after nearly 18 months of treatment. Indianapolis-based Lilly is conducting additional studies of tirzepatide for weight loss before it can submit the drug for regulatory approval for that use, potentially next year.</p><p>Doctors say the dual-purpose drugs appear to be among the most effective and safest pharmaceutical options for people who are overweight or obese. Some older diet drugs had serious safety concerns or modest efficacy, which together with spotty insurance coverage limited their use among patients.</p><p>\"It's a whole new world,\" said Thomas Wadden, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, who previously led Penn's weight-loss center. \"It's exciting from the standpoint of patient satisfaction and changes in quality of life.\"</p><p>Novo Nordisk launched Wegovy last year, a drug in a class known as glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, agonists. They work by mimicking natural hormones that stimulate the release of insulin and help suppress appetite.</p><p>Lilly's tirzepatide promotes both GLP-1 and a second hormone, called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, or GIP. Promoting GIP was shown in animal studies to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure, resulting in weight reductions.</p><p>\"We know from a lot of research these hormones are involved not just in the regulation of glucose in the body, but also in the regulation of energy balance,\" said Nadia Ahmad, Lilly's medical director of the tirzepatide obesity program.</p><p>The advances could mean big sales for drugmakers. Sales of Novo's obesity drugs more than doubled to about $480 million for the first three months of 2022, helped by the launch of Wegovy. Novo expects annual anti-obesity drug sales to reach more than $3.5 billion by 2025.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analysts predict that Lilly would generate peak annual sales of $10 billion for tirzepatide's use in obesity alone, if it is approved for that use. Together with its use in Type 2 diabetes, the analysts predict total peak annual sales of $25 billion for the drug.</p><p>The drugs carry high prices. Novo's Wegovy has a list price of about $1,300 a month.</p>",
