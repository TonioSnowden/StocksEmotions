  "text": "<p>The Hong Kong stock exchange has picked a senior JPMorgan banker as its new chief executive as it seeks to build its fast-growing pipeline of new share offerings and trading link-ups with mainland Chinese bourses. </p> <p>Nicolas Aguzin, chief executive of JPMorgan's international private bank, will take the helm at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the company that runs the city's stock market, in May for a period of three years. </p> <p>“The board believes that Mr Aguzin's extensive experience in Hong Kong, mainland China, Asia and globally, and his deep knowledge of global capital markets, will help HKEX continue to build its competitiveness,” the exchange said in a statement released after market close on Tuesday.</p> <p>His appointment must still be approved by the city's Securities and Futures Commission, according to the company.</p> <p>The move comes as the exchange faces questions about Hong Kong's future as Asia's biggest international financial hub after Beijing imposed a draconian <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2acb077f-9f81-4457-9932-5223334facee\">national security law</a> on the city last year.</p> <p>Aguzin has been with JPMorgan for 30 years, with almost a decade of that spent in Asia. He served as chairman and chief executive for the Asia-Pacific region from 2012 to 2020.</p> <p>Aguzin will be the second consecutive banker from JPMorgan to serve as chief executive of the bourse, following on from predecessor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e78b82b-97d7-4a4b-b155-b2acb4dfa010\">Charles Li</a>, who was chairman of JPMorgan China from 2003 to 2009.</p> <p>Li, an outspoken figure who has weathered multiple controversies during his tenure, was originally set to continue in the role until October 2021 but stepped down at the end of December.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1770e787-22db-4c57-9228-31528a37de8a.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In a statement on Aguzin's appointment, Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, said: “I'm proud to congratulate my colleague . . . on his important new role as the next CEO of the Hong Kong stock exchange.” </p> <p>JPMorgan said Martin Marron, chief executive of its Latin America private bank and the head of Latin America and Canada, would replace Aguzin as its head of international private banking.</p> <p>Unlike Li and HKEX's interim chief executive Calvin Tai, who joined the exchange in 1998, Aguzin does not speak Chinese, but is fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese.</p> <p>Laura Cha, chairman of HKEX, said Aguzin's international background “will be of great help to us at this stage in our development”.</p> <p>“The fact he does not speak Chinese will not be a factor that affects any of our policies or any of our relationships with our counterparties,” Cha said.</p> <p>She said the appointment did not need regulatory approval from Beijing.</p> <p>Li departed HKEX on a relatively high note — despite a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18ec7390-e9cc-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">failed attempt</a> to acquire the London Stock Exchange in 2019 — as a string of Chinese tech groups raised billions of dollars in Hong Kong last year.</p> <p>They did this through “homecoming” share offerings — dual listings by mainland Chinese companies already present on Wall Street — enabled by reforms Li had championed.</p> <p>While authorities have launched a severe crackdown on political dissent since the national security law's passage in June, Hong Kong's stock market has enjoyed a banner start to 2021 as mainland Chinese investors have poured funds into shares they view as undervalued. </p> <p>The bourse is reaping the benefits of other programmes launched under Li, including market link-ups with Shanghai and Shenzhen, which now account for about 10 per cent of revenues, say analysts at Citigroup. </p> <p>Li also introduced changes to allow Chinese tech groups with weighted voting rights — which give company founders and management multiple votes per share — to list in the city.</p> <p>“Mr Aguzin's experience in investment banking could imply HKEX could be more open for mergers and acquisitions as a growth driver,” said Yafei Tian, an equities analyst at Citi.</p> <p>Tian added that HKEX's previous efforts to attract international listings had been a “mixed success”, and that Aguzin's international experience “might suggest the board's intention to further diversify revenue streams”.</p><p>Source: Hudson Lockett and Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong 2021 'Hong Kong stock exchange names JPMorgan banker as chief executive' FT.com 9 February.
