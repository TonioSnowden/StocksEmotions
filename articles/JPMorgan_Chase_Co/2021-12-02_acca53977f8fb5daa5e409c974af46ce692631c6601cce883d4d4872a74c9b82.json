  "title": "Business News: Capital One to Drop Overdraft Fee --- Consumer advocates have said such fees disproportionately affect Black families",
  "text": "<p>For years, politicians and consumer advocates have said the fees disproportionately affect Black families and those with low and moderate incomes.</p><p>A report released in June by Financial Health Network, a research firm, found that Black households and those with low-to-moderate incomes were almost twice as likely to incur overdraft fees as white households or those with higher incomes.</p><p>Online bank Ally Financial Inc. eliminated its overdraft fees in June, saying that they hurt people living paycheck to paycheck. Some other banks have introduced products and features that are more lenient on overdrafts.</p><p>Capital One didn't give a reason forwhy it is scrapping its fees now. In a letter to employees, Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said Capital One wants to reimagine banking and help customers succeed.</p><p>The bank currently charges $35 for overdrafts, according to its website. Capital One said it would stop charging the fee early next year, as well as a $35 nonsufficient funds fee charged when a transaction is denied.</p><p>Those enrolled in its overdraft protection service will be automatically switched to a no-fee service next year. For those who aren't enrolled, the bank will reject any transactions that would cause an account to be overdrawn at no cost. Those not currently enrolled can apply for the no-fee service, the bank said.</p><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, some banks waived overdraft fees or offered refunds.</p><p>Financial firms brought in an estimated $31.3 billion in consumer overdraft revenue in 2020, according to financial-data firm Moebs Services Inc., down nearly 10% from a year earlier.</p><p>At a May Senate committee hearing with U.S. bank chief executives, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) criticized JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. for collecting nearly $1.5 billion in overdraft fees in 2020.</p><p>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank waived fees upon request for those stressed by the pandemic.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
