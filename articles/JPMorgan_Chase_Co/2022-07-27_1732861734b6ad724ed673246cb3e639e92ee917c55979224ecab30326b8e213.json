  "title": "Spirit and Frontier End Merger Agreement; Rejection of Frontier leaves Spirit open to potential JetBlue acquisition",
  "text": "<p>Spirit Chief Executive Ted Christie said Wednesday that Spirit's board would continue discussions with JetBlue, adding that he was disappointed to have to terminate the merger with Frontier.</p><p>Spirit investors were widely expected to reject the Frontier merger, and the announcement that the deal had been called off came shortly before Spirit was due to release the results of a shareholder vote.</p><p>Spirit and Frontier announced their plans to merge in February in a cash-and-stock deal that was valued at about $2.9 billion at the time. Less than two months later, JetBlue lobbed a competing offer for Spiritâ€”a move that JetBlue said it had been considering since before the pandemic but that took many in the industry by surprise.</p><p>JetBlue's bid for Spirit is worth about $3.7 billion in cash, significantly more than the cash-and-stock deal with Frontier. The end of Spirit's agreement with Frontier doesn't necessarily mean it will strike a new deal with JetBlue, however. And if they do agree to a merger, it would need to be approved by regulators.</p><p>The tug of war over Spirit has become the airline industry's most contentious battle in years. Both Frontier and JetBlue were hoping to use Spirit to bulk up and secure their position as the fifth-largest U.S. airline, taking on the four major carriers that dominate the industry in the U.S.</p><p>While not unexpected, the decision to call off the merger with Frontier is a reversal from a position Spirit held fast to for months, despite relentless pressure from JetBlue. Spirit rebuffed JetBlue several times, opting to stick with a deal with Frontier that it said has a better chance of passing muster with antitrust regulators and would be better for investors in the long run as the industry recovers from the pandemic.</p><p>Under the terms of the deal with Frontier, Spirit investors would have kept a stake in the combined company.</p><p>Losing out on a deal to buy Spirit is a defeat for Frontier and its chairman, William Franke, who has long been angling to join the two discount airlines into a budget behemoth with nationwide reach.</p><p>Frontier executives said Wednesday that they were disappointed in the outcome, but that they had taken a disciplined approach to the negotiations and were unwilling to overpay.</p><p>Frontier said Wednesday that it is poised to grow as a stand-alone airline, and is positioned to capture growing demand for cheap leisure travel.</p><p>The Denver-based carrier will likely still remain in a strong position if Spirit ends up in JetBlue's hands, industry analysts have said. With its main competitor out of the picture, Frontier would be the biggest remaining carrier in the niche of fast-growing budget airlines known as ultralow cost carriers.</p><p>\"That creates a lot of runway ahead of us,\" Frontier Chief Executive Barry Biffle said during an earnings call Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\"We believe Frontier will largely inherit the keys to the low-cost kingdom in the U.S.,\" JPMorgan Chase analyst Jamie Baker wrote in a client note.</p><p>(More to Come)</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>Spirit and Frontier End Merger Agreement</p>",
