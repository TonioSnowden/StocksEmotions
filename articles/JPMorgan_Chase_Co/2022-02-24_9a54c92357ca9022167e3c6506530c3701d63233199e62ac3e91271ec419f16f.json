  "title": "Russian Stock Market Craters as Moscow Copes With Financial Impact of Invasion; Central bank tapped its $600 billion-plus war chest to prop up the ruble and regulators banned short selling on the stock market",
  "text": "<p>Lines formed at ATMs in Moscow and Sberbank, Russia's largest bank by assets, tried to reassure customers that their funds were safe despite threats from the U.S. that the bank may be sanctioned next. Sberbank's shares fell by nearly half.</p><p>To ease the pain, Russia's central bank said it would tap its $600 billion-plus reserve chest to prop up the ruble and provide cheap financing for local banks. Regulators also banned short selling on the stock market.</p><p>Russia has spent the years since the 2014 annexation of Crimea trying to shore up its finances and reduce its reliance on Western markets. But its role as a major commodities exporter means its economy and finances are still heavily entwined with the West. A new round of sanctions on Russian banks could curb their ability to process transactions for energy companies that are the lifeblood of Russia's economy.</p><p>Sanctions will \"be in place as long as Putin is president and that's going to hit growth, that's going to hit investment,\" said Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital.</p><p>Foreign investors have treaded lightly in Russia since 2014. Sanctions against buying Russian bonds directly from the government have been in place for several years and were strengthened this week by U.S. and European Union authorities. Further measures targeting Russia's financial system were expected later Thursday.</p><p>Foreign ownership of Russia's local-currency bond market fell below 20% in January, having gradually declined since its recent peak of almost 35% in March 2020, according to figures from Russia's central bank.</p><p>But the country's stocks and bonds still make up a chunk of emerging-market indexes widely followed by investors, though smaller than heavyweight China. Russia makes up around 6% of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s popular local-currency emerging-market bond index. MSCI's emerging-market stock index had a 2.8% weighting for Russia as of Tuesday, compared with China's weighting of almost 32%.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Russia's economy?</p><p>Investors in the U.S. have exposure to Russian assets through the popular U.S.-listed iShares MSCI Emerging-Markets ETF or the iShares MSCI Russia ETF.</p><p>\"Putin has probably made Russia a pariah for investors,\" said Timothy Ash, an emerging-markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. He began reducing his exposure to Russian and Ukrainian debt last year as tensions rose.</p><p>Yields on Russia's few outstanding dollar bonds soared, partially on fears that holding them may become illegal or that Russia will default on them in retaliation. The yield on a Russian dollar bond maturing in June 2027 climbed to 19% Thursday from 7% Wednesday, according to Tradeweb.</p><p>The cost of insuring against default on $10,000 of five-year Russian dollar-denominated bonds using derivatives contracts called credit default swaps climbed to about $738 a year Thursday, up from $124 a year at the end of 2021, according to IHS Markit.</p><p>Local government bonds, widely held by the country's banks, also sold off heavily, with borrowing costs on 10-year bonds rising to more than 13% compared with less than 10% a few days ago.</p><p>The stock-market swoon, the rapid escalation of bond yields and the drop in the ruble all have the potential to swing back on Russia's large, state-controlled banks.</p><p>To shield lenders from immediate pain, the central bank said Tuesday that it would allow banks to report shares and bonds they held at the market value as of Feb. 18 and to make similar moves regarding the ruble.</p><p>Earlier this month the Russian central bank estimated that banks had 250 billion rubles, the equivalent of $3 billion, in paper losses in January from a fall in the price of securities they hold.</p><p>Banks take a hit from a depreciation of the ruble because a chunk of their assets is denominated in foreign currency. As foreign currency appreciates against the ruble, banks' risk-weighted assets, which is the balance sheet calculation used to set capital requirements, appreciate. It could get to a point where banks become undercapitalized and need intervention.</p><p>Anna Hirtenstein and Paul Hannon contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Russian Stock Market Craters as Moscow Copes With Financial Impact of Invasion</p>",
