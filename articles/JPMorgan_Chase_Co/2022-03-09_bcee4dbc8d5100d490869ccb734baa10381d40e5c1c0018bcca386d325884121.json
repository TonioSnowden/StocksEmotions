  "text": "<p>The US has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef66f458-68a8-4612-bbb7-b9f19934cd15\">blocked the transfer</a> of fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine for fear of being dragged into a direct conflict with Russia.</p> <p>John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Polish proposal for Warsaw to transfer its fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly, to Kyiv was not “tenable”.</p> <p>Washington and Warsaw had been in talks about the military transfer to help the Ukraine government repel Russian air power for days. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said at the weekend the Biden administration was looking “actively” at a deal that would involve the US supplying American F-16 fighter jets to Poland to make up for the shortfall.</p> <p>The Polish government said yesterday it would send the Soviet-era jets to the US air force base in Ramstein, Germany “immediately and free of charge”, adding it was prepared to pay for the F-16 replacements.</p> <p>But the Pentagon last night ruled out the complex plan. “The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the . . . US' departing from a US Nato base in Germany, to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine, raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance,” Kirby said.</p> <p>The Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81630924-deb4-4ee8-abed-006a90972bb0#post-63aded7c-2282-43b2-bd66-ef0185c92839\">warned western countries</a> against providing combat aircraft to Ukraine, describing the proposal as a “potentially dangerous scenario”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Russia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/717c4244-0dda-4564-8380-6cb1352afd68\">is pushing ahead</a> with its planned invasion of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, with fighting ongoing in the north-west of the city. The Russian army has also continued to besiege the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol which have all been subjected to heavy shelling. </p> <p>Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, has repeatedly asked Nato members who own old Russian-made warplanes to give them to Ukraine. The Biden administration had ruled out a transfer of fighter jets, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f1f0944-ceab-4042-93bd-63c2d863a75f\">an emotional plea</a> by Zelensky to 300 members of Congress via a Zoom call at the weekend prompted a rethink by the White House, administration officials said.</p> <h1>More on Ukraine</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Energy market:</strong> The Biden administration has told US shale producers they must do <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fee88e80-8ba9-4ab8-9d79-cbd9235dd29b\">“whatever it takes”</a> to increase supplies.
