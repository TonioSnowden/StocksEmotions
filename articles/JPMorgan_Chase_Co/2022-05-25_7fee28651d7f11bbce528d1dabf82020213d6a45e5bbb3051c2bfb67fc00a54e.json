  "title": "Russia Bondholders Say Debt Default Could Already Be Here; Some investors say that a small interest payment is overdue, which could trigger credit-default swap contracts",
  "text": "<p>The allegedly overdue payment represents interest that Russia accrued while it spent 28 days in a grace period in April and early May, the documents show. The bond in question matured in early April. Russia didn't pay its foreign interest for nearly a month, until an 11th hour payment was made .</p><p>However, some bondholders have said that Moscow forgot to include an estimated $1.9 million of accrued interest that was generated in the interim, which is now overdue beyond the grace period, and they have accordingly informed Euroclear, the records show.</p><p>Euroclear didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The size of the alleged interest payments miss is too small to trigger cross-defaults across Russia's outstanding foreign debts, according to a person familiar with the matter. But investors have submitted to Euroclear, the custodian for the foreign-currency bonds, that the missed interest payments should constitute an event of default, the records show.</p><p>If it is deemed a default by market participants, that could trigger payments on credit-default swap contracts that act as insurance against bond defaults. Whether the contracts pay out is up to a body that oversees the swap industry and usually needs a payment miss of around $1 million for the claim to be considered valid.</p><p>There are about $4.5 billion in credit-default swap contracts that directly reference Russia, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co . research.</p><p>Investors have anticipated for some time that debt payments from Moscow would likely stop as Western nations tightened Russia's access to foreign credit. Most of Russia's foreign-currency debts have been trading between 10 cents and 20 cents on the dollar since February when the invasion of Ukraine began.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
