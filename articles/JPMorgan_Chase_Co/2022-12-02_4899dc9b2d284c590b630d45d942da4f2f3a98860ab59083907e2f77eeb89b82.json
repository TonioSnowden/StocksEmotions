  "title": "Business News: Tyson Finance Chief Pleads Not Guilty In Trespassing Case",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Tyson will have a trial on the charges Feb. 15, according to Fayetteville District Court.</p><p>Following Mr. Tyson's not-guilty plea, the company's board said in a statement that after reviewing the incident, it has continued confidence in Mr. Tyson as CFO. The company said last month that its independent board directors were overseeing a review of the matter.</p><p>\"I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions,\" Mr. Tyson said on a Nov. 14 earnings call with analysts a week after spending an early Sunday morning in jail on Nov. 6. \"I am committed to making sure that this never happens again.\"</p><p>Mr. Tyson was appointed in late September as CFO of Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales. Before taking over as financial chief, he had been serving as Tyson's executive vice president of strategy and chief sustainability officer -- roles he still holds.</p><p>He joined Tyson in 2019, after earning a master's of business administration degree from Stanford University. He has held various roles in investment banking, private equity and venture capital, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Mr. Tyson's father, John H. Tyson, has been chairman since 1998 and served as the company's chief executive from 2000 until 2006.</p><p>Attorneys said pleading not guilty makes sense in Mr. Tyson's case. Doing so gives him more time to negotiate with prosecutors to potentially avoid a criminal conviction, and a later trial date allows him more time to get counseling for alcohol use and show prosecutors it is a one-time offense, said Rick Kornfeld, a Colorado attorney who specializes in white-collar crime.</p><p>Mr. Tyson could be trying to reach a deal to avoid a criminal conviction, and instead pay a fine for violating a city ordinance, said Riza Dagli, chairman of the New Jersey law firm Brach Eichler's criminal defense and government investigations practice. \"The strategy is 'we don't want him to plead guilty to a crime, because then he's got a criminal record,'\" he said. \"You're not going to plead guilty right out of the box.\" Neither Mr. Kornfeld nor Mr. Dagli is involved in Mr. Tyson's case, they said.</p><p>The Fayetteville Police Department's report said a woman told police that she thought Mr. Tyson came in through an unlocked front door and that she didn't know him.</p><p>Police responding to the scene found him under a comforter and he briefly attempted to go back to sleep, police body camera footage of the incident showed, and officers reported the smell of alcohol.</p>",
