  "title": "Jeff Bezos: 'Batten Down the Hatches' as Economy Cools",
  "text": "<p>\"Yep, the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches,\" Mr. Bezos said in a tweet Tuesday night.</p><p>Mr. Bezos is the world's second-richest person with a net worth of $139 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His comments come as tech firms have undergone waves of layoffs and as economic growth and hiring have slowed. A recent survey of economists by The Wall Street Journal also found that they expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming 12 months as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and attempts to cool stubbornly high inflation.</p><p>The views of other business executives also have become increasingly gloomy. Mr. Solomon said in a CNBC interview Tuesday that a recession could happen soon and there may be \"more volatility on the horizon.\"</p><p>\"That doesn't mean for sure that we have a really difficult economic scenario,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"But on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States.\"</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimonalso said earlier this month he thinks the U.S. is heading for recession in the middle of next year.</p><p>Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk said in August he expects the U.S. to have a mild recession.</p><p>Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan is one notable optimistic voice among corporate executives.</p><p>Mr. Moynihan said Monday that high inflation and rising interest rates haven't slowed down American consumers. The company's data show that spending growth remains strong and deposit balances remain higher than prepandemic levels while delinquencies remain low, he said.</p>",
