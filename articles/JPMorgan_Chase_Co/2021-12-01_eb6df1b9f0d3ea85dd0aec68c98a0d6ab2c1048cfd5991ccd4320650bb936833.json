  "text": "<p><em>Click </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ac056ee-4093-4d35-ab5e-5e1b533320cd\"><em>here</em></a> <em>to listen to the latest news in less than three minutes. Top Stories Today is an audio news digest that gets you up to speed on the day's headlines.</em></p> <p>Jay Powell yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/181021d7-9dc4-4a55-a8e9-d5ae26e8e5c1\">signalled his support</a> for a speedier withdrawal of the Federal Reserve's massive&#xa0;asset purchase programme and was significantly more hawkish on inflation than in recent appearances, suggesting the Fed should drop the word “transitory” to describe the current price surge.</p> <p>The comments, the first to Congress since Powell was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e9540a2-2ba8-4e0e-84d8-a1945c20453a\">nominated for a second term</a> as Fed chair, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afd08e54-52a5-4c48-92a2-7b0245cfbf65\">led to a plunge</a> in global equity markets. </p> <p>The S&amp;P 500, which was already lower following negative <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f\">comments from Moderna's chief executive</a> about the effectiveness of vaccines to tackle the new Omicron strain, ended down 1.9 per cent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite share index closed 1.6 per cent lower. </p> <p>Yields on shorter-dated Treasury securities, which move with interest rate expectations, rose while longer-dated Treasury yields that track economic growth and inflation expectations fell.</p> <p>Traders also modified their bets on how hawkish a stance they expect the Fed to take in the coming months — a U-turn on the previous few days, when investors had wagered that the emergence of the Omicron variant would prompt the central bank to take a more patient approach to raising rates. Implied rates on federal funds futures jumped, with markets pricing in just over two quarter-point rate rises by the end of next year.</p> <p>“The economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high,” Powell told lawmakers. “It is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases . . . perhaps a few months sooner.”</p> <p>Powell said he expected the Federal Open Market Committee to discuss a speedier taper at its next meeting on December 14 and 15. Equity markets in Europe and Asia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8e27b4e-805c-401b-bacd-75404120c479\">have rebounded</a> today and Wall Street is expected to open higher. </p> <p><em>Do you agree with Powell or has Omicron changed the outlook for the US economy?
