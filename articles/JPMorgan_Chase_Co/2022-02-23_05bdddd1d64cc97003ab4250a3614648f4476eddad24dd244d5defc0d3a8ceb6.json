  "text": "<p>High turnover looks good on an income statement, but bad on a payroll. By April, Barclays will have changed its two top executives in just six months. New chief executive CS “Venkat” Venkatakrishnan has replaced Jes Staley, who stepped down amid probes into his relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. A freshly minted finance sidekick, Anna Cross, starts from April. </p> <p>So much for staffing continuity in a tight labour market.</p> <p>Staley left on a low and his deferred bonuses have been frozen while regulators mull his links to Epstein. His longtime finance director Tushar Morzaria is leaving on a high that also gives Venkatakrishnan a soft start. The bank has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7f22c43-3c2b-441c-8774-b2225dafd8f0\">reported record group earnings</a> for 2021. </p> <p>Almost every line on the quarterly P&amp;L beat expectations. Investment banking, the engine of Barclays' recovery, did not outperform peers on revenues, but instead due to a surprising drop in costs. </p> <p>Venkatakrishnan's long background in risk management at JPMorgan and Barclays should come in handy. He may be a steadier Eddie than Staley, who deserves credit for preserving the investment bank, but whose personal risk management was chaotic.</p> <p>The market will discover if a less buccaneering boss can erase the discount to book value — now 0.5 times — that has persisted for the past 12 years. </p> <p>Retail banking may have to pull the train in the next year or so. A hint of what could come from well-provisioned loan books appeared in the result. A small write-back on impairments in the last quarter of £37mn was much better than the analyst consensus of a credit cost of £157mn. For the year, £653mn flowed back through profits.</p> <p>Higher interest rates should boost net interest margins that stood at 2.93 per cent last year. Given its healthy capital base, Barclays should have well over £3bn of excess capital as buffer.</p> <p>Barclays' shares offer a value proposition for investors who favour European bank shares, which Lex does not. The challenge for Venkatakrishnan and his new finance director is to make that value a little less glaring by getting the price up.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Barclays: Venkat's challenge is to lift laggardly shares' FT.com 23 February.
