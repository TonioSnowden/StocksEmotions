  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Citigroup's Profit Falls as It Boosts Loan-Loss Funds",
  "text": "<p>For Citigroup, which has more of a global presence than other banks, turmoil in markets, currencies and interest rates boosted its trading business and units that help big companies manage and move money around the world. Revenue jumped 11% to $19.64 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast for $18.4 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Citigroup's profit fell to $4.55 billion, or $2.19 a share, but beat the $1.68 a share expected by analysts.</p><p>Citigroup is the only big U.S. bank so far this quarter to beat analysts' expectations. Shares jumped $5.84, or 13%, to $49.98 on Friday, its biggest percentage gain since March 2020, after a broad selloff Thursday.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. also reported on Friday, posting a 48% decline in profit. Its shares were up $2.39, or 6.2%, to $41.13 on a strong day for bank stocks.</p><p>Despite Friday's strong showing, U.S. stocks have fallen sharply this year on concerns about a global slowdown, hurting bank shares in particular. The Federal Reserve has been raising rates to try to combat inflation, but many investors worry that will tip the economy into recession.</p><p>The economy is sending divergent signals about its health. Consumers and businesses remain financially strong, for the most part. But bank executives across the industry have said that there remains more uncertainty than normal about where the economy is headed.</p><p>\"While sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession,\" Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser said, pointing to consumer balance sheets, strong hiring markets and corporate demand. \"So while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be as sharp a downturn as others in recent memory.\"</p><p>Ms. Fraser said the evidence is different in Europe. \"We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply,\" she said. \"And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon.\"</p><p>The bank set aside an extra $375 million in new funds for potential future loan losses, which hurt earnings. A year ago, with the global economy emerging from a pandemic slump, Citigroup released $2.4 billion from reserves.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which reported Thursday, also said it was setting aside new funds for potential bad loans.</p><p>Wells Fargo's profit dropped by nearly half, weighed down by a decline in the value of its equity investments and a drop in mortgage originations. Mortgage originations fell 36%, crimped by higher rates. \"Consumers and businesses have been resilient so far,\" CEO Charlie Scharf said on a call with analysts.</p><p>Higher interest rates are typically a boon to banks, since they can charge more on loans. Wells Fargo said it expects net interest income to increase about 20% in 2022 compared with 2021.</p>",
