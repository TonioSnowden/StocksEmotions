  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  NCR Bids  To Snatch  An ATM  Operator  ----  By Miriam Gottfried and Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   NCR Corp. is in talks to buy Cardtronics PLC, according to people familiar with the matter, seeking to snatch it away from a pair of investment firms, including private-equity giant Apollo Global Management Inc., that earlier agreed to buy the ATM operator. </p><p>   Cardtronics said Thursday it had received an unsolicited bid worth $39 a share and that it had entered into discussions with the suitor, which it didn't name. The new bidder is NCR, the people said. </p><p>   The move sets up a potential bidding war for a company that operates 285,000 ATMs in 10 countries, according to its website. </p><p>   Houston-based Cardtronics on Dec. 15 announced a deal to be sold to Apollo and investment firm Hudson Executive Capital LP for $35 a share. Hudson Executive owns a roughly 19% stake in Cardtronics. Its founder, former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. finance chief Douglas Braunstein, sits on its board and has recused himself from sale discussions, the company has said. </p><p>   Atlanta-based NCR, formerly known as National Cash Register and once owned by AT&amp;T Inc., makes ATMs as well as point-of-sale systems and self-service kiosks for businesses such as retailers and restaurants. Similar to other hardware makers, it has been pivoting its business toward software sales and other recurring services. </p><p>   This isn't the first time Apollo has recently been faced with a competing offer for a publicly traded company it had agreed to buy. In late 2019, the private-equity firm raised its offer for Tech Data Corp. after the technology distributor received a bid from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Apollo's deal for Tech Data closed in June of last year. </p><p></p>",
