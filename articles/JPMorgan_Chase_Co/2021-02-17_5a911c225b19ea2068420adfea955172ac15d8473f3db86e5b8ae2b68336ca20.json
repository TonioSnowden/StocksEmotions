The funds sued Revlon and Citi in retaliation.&#xa0;</p> <p>It wouldn't have even been such a huge story if Citi hadn't accidentally sent them the $900m just days later.</p> <p>Citi managed to recover $400m of the misplaced cash from certain funds, but $500m still remains with Revlon's lenders.</p> <p>Despite finding that the money Citi sent was “indisputably transferred by mistake”, Furman wrote that he was bound by precedent to rule in favour of the funds. New York law was just too cut and dry.</p> <p>It's not the first time this has happened — <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> mistakenly wired $6bn to a US hedge fund client in 2015, a mistake blamed on a junior employee who processed a trade with “too many zeroes” while his boss was on holiday. Then there was <strong>JPMorgan</strong>'s $1.5bn <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-generalmotors-bankruptcy-loan/long-fight-over-error-in-jpmorgan-loan-to-gm-settles-for-231-million-idUSKCN1SJ2GB\">loan snafu</a> and subsequent decade-long legal battle.</p> <p>For those that didn't see Judge Furman's ruling coming, they need only have looked at his decision on <strong>Windstream </strong>in 2019.</p> <p>To the surprise of many Wall Street observers, he sided with hedge fund<strong> Aurelius Capital Management</strong> that a 2015 decision to spin off Windstream's telecom infrastructure business had constituted a default. DD's Sujeet Indap and Robert Smith <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1208cd0-3289-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5\">followed the case closely</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>After a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f6b47f9-70c7-4839-8bb4-6a62f1bd39e0\">rough start to the year</a>, hedge funds might secretly be hoping that history continues to repeat itself. That is, except for the ones that gave their money back to Citigroup.</p> <h2>The next Spac frontier is upon us</h2> <p>America is teeming with European exports — French wine, German engineering, Italian leather — but one Wall Street delicacy is catching fire across the Atlantic, and bankers are racing to get in on the demand.</p> <p>Frequent DD readers will by now know we're talking about Spacs.&#xa0;</p> <p>A Spac frenzy is “unquestionably” making its way towards Europe, according to <strong>Nick Koemtzopoulos</strong>, head of Emea equity capital markets at <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>. “The level of dialogue and interest has gone up substantially. We're having daily conversations with both issuers and private companies.”</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> this week placed two of its M&amp;A bankers,<strong> Guillermo Baygual</strong>, and <strong>Lukasz Dziarnowski</strong> on a new Spac specialist team focusing on the Emea region.</p> <p>And in the race to become Europe's Spac capital, Amsterdam <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/240293a8-20ed-4cf3-a5ec-63dc1c2d9076?\">is widely expected</a> to take the crown, reports the FT's Nikou Asgari. Its listing rules closely mirror those of the US, which is the standard everyone is trying to replicate, and its reputation as an international venue is drawing in new money faster than its European rivals.&#xa0;</p> <p>Amsterdam this week got a hefty vote of confidence from a powerful pairing. <strong>Jean Pierre Mustier</strong>, the former <strong>UniCredit</strong> chief, and <strong>LVMH </strong>founder/wolf-in-cashmere <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f523768d-41af-492c-95b0-ff5d23a30539\">teamed up</a> to launch a Spac that will target European financial companies.</p> <p>“Amsterdam stock exchange has developed an expertise in Spacs ahead of all other cities in Europe at this point,” Mustier told the FT's Stephen Morris. “Amsterdam is becoming the international stock exchange for Europe.”</p> <p>Bankers and lawyers say that conversations about launching a Spac in Europe are almost all centred around the Netherlands, with several deals already in the works.</p> <p>The widespread preference for Amsterdam over London, which is tied to unfriendly listing rules for Spacs on the London Stock Exchange, is yet another blow for the UK after the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dad4ef3-59e8-437e-8f63-f629a5b7d0aa\">reported</a> it had already lost its place as Europe's top share trading hub. Amsterdam has snapped up a portion of London's euro-derivatives and carbon trading too.</p> <p>Although only one Spac has listed on the continent so far this year, compared to more than 140 in the US, sponsors are hoping that the advantages of listing in Europe will draw companies away from the flood of Spac cash swirling around across the pond.</p> <h2>Rescuing Robinhood: what's in it for Ribbit?</h2> <p>Mid-short squeeze madness, when <strong>Robinhood</strong> chief executive and co-founder <strong>Vlad Tenev </strong>was in a desperate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e69faf0-09c4-42ca-8c5f-78dc9568c18f\">pinch for capital</a>, he phoned a friend.</p> <p>Enter <strong>Micky Malka</strong>, the Venezuelan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/804ab072-445a-499e-abe5-12cb73e8e565\">venture capitalist</a> behind <strong>Ribbit Capital</strong>.</p> <p>The group agreed to lead a new round of convertible debt financing, wiring its investment that same day. Other investors piled in, giving Robinhood more than $1bn in funding commitments by the next morning.</p> <p>Ribbit ended up investing more than $500m of the total $3.4bn in financing that Robinhood secured, in exchange for the opportunity to convert the debt into equity at a discount to the company's future initial public offering price, insiders told DD's Miles Kruppa.</p> <p>It was a deal of astounding size and speed — but also risk.&#xa0;</p> <p>For the gamble to pay off, Robinhood needs to pull off a successful IPO, a milestone the commission-free trading platform must navigate while facing significant political dangers.</p> <p>Tenev is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0ff1262-9f61-4a23-a057-2884cfdec6b7\">expected</a> to testify to a room full of angry US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Thursday. Separately, regulators are prodding the platform's controversial “payment order flow” business model, in which it sells client orders to large market-makers.</p> <p>It's not exactly a straightforward bet. But with a record for 30 per cent returns on his venture funds, before fees and expenses, Malka ought to be feeling lucky.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Indonesia has appointed <strong>Ridha Wirakusumah</strong>, head of the country's <strong>Bank Permata</strong>, to head the<strong> Indonesia Investment Authority</strong>, a new multibillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund.
