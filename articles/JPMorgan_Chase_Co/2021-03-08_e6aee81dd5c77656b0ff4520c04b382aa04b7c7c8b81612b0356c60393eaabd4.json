  "text": "<p>\"The pandemic has amplified many of the challenges women work to overcome every day, particularly for Black women and Latinas who face racial wealth gaps in addition to gender wealth gaps,\" said Byna Elliott, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s head of Advancing Black Pathways, the firm's effort to invest in Black businesses.</p><p>Some women are having to make difficult financial decisions and change their lifestyles in ways they never expected. One reason is the lack of a financial cushion: While the typical Black or Hispanic family has $2,000 or less in liquid savings, the typical white family has more than four times that amount, according to a September report from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Alicia Ocampo, a server in Chicago, lost her job in March. Her 4-year-old son's daycare shut down soon after. The 29-year-old single mother had saved a portion of each paycheck and boosted her emergency fund to about six months of expenses. Her savings were gone by the end of September.</p><p>Realizing she had to move quickly to protect what was left of her savings, she stopped renting last spring and moved in with her parents. She is now sharing a room with her son and her 22-year-old sister. Unemployment insurance has helped her contribute toward her parents' household bills.</p><p>While Ms. Ocampo is thankful she has a family to assist her, she is disappointed that she and her son need to rely on others. Her unemployment assistance is running out soon and she has no steady job prospects in sight. \"It's very scary,\" she said.</p><p>Black and Hispanic women typically earn less than white women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hispanic women's median weekly earnings in 2019 were $642, compared with $704 for Black women and $910 for white women, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by the Institute for Women's Policy Research.</p><p>Black and Hispanic women held many of the retail and hospitality jobs that were badly hit by the pandemic, though the sectors registered some recovery in the past month.</p><p>A recent study by Capital Group, to be released later this year, found women of color were more likely than other women to use their Covid-19 relief checks to pay for necessities and bills rather than add the funds to savings accounts.</p><p>They may be more likely to financially support family during times of crisis, which further pressures their finances. Nearly 30% of affluent Black women and Latinas financially supported friends and family in 2020, compared with 11% of affluent white women, according to a December study from J.P. Morgan Wealth Management.</p><p>Many are less likely to receive the benefit of an inheritance: 68% of Black women neither have nor expect an inheritance compared with 39% of white women, according to a February study of Black investors by Charles Schwab and Ariel Investments.</p><p>Portia Alyce Lawrence, a Los Angeles resident in her 50s, was furloughed from her national sales manager job at the Cincinnati USA Convention and Visitors Bureau in March. She was laid off permanently in September from the job.</p><p>Before the pandemic, her emergency fund grew to cover two years of living expenses. She is now down to about eight months of emergency savings. Her brothers have offered to lend her money, but she doesn't want their help. \"As a single Black woman, I count on myself,\" she said.</p>",
