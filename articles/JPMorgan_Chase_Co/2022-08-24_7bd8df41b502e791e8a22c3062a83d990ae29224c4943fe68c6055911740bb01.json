  "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond Clinches Loan Deal; The troubled retailer tapped a new financing source as its stock slides",
  "text": "<p>A loan deal would provide liquidity and give vendors confidence they can continue to ship goods to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which is fighting to correct missteps from an ill-fated push into private-label brands. The retailer had been seeking about $375 million to pad its cash levels and help pay down existing debt, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.</p><p>The size and structure of the final deal wasn't immediately clear on Tuesday. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and JPMorgan didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The company's shares skyrocketed last week on a burst of interest from individual investors but have been sliding since billionaire activist Ryan Cohen announced his exit from the stock and sold off his 10% stake. The falling share price narrowed the options available to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to build liquidity, staunch its cash bleed and ensure continued shipments from suppliers.</p><p>The company has signaled it has to raise cash. While it has said it should be fine for a year, its business remains in decline. The company used up more than $500 million in cash in the latest quarter ended in May.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has said it would provide an update on efforts to strengthen its balance sheet at the end of the month.</p><p>Laura Cooper contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jodi Xu Klein at jodi.klein@wsj.com and Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
