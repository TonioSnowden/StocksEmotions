  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Morgan Stanley's  Chief Executive  Paid $35 Million  ----  By Charley Grant",
  "text": "<p>   Morgan Stanley paid Chief Executive Officer James Gorman $35 million for his work in 2021, a 6% raise from the previous year and his largest pay package ever since becoming CEO in 2010. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley's board of directors awarded Mr. Gorman about $25 million in company stock and about $10 million in cash, including a bonus of about $8 million, according to a securities filing Friday. </p><p>   Four-fifths of Mr. Gorman's stock award is tied to how well the bank performs over the next few years. </p><p>   For his work in 2020, Mr. Gorman received a compensation package valued at $33 million. </p><p>   Mr. Gorman presided over record results at the New York bank in 2021. Large companies flocked to Wall Street for deals, and demand for money-management services from wealthy individuals remained brisk. The bank's revenue grew 23% from a year earlier to $59.8 billion, while profit grew 37% to $15 billion. </p><p>   JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also posted record results in 2021. That blockbuster year led to higher compensation for Wall Street's rank-and-file. </p><p>   JPMorgan said Thursday it is paying CEO Jamie Dimon $34.5 million for his work in 2021. That means Mr. Gorman could again be the best-paid bank CEO, as he was for 2020. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley shareholders have benefited alongside Mr. Gorman. The bank's shares rose 43% in 2021, outperforming the S&amp;P 500. </p><p></p>",
