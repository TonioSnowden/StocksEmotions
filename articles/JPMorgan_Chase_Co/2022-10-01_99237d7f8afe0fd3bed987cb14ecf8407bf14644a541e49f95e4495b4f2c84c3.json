  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Quarterly Market Review: Oil Prices Notch Worst Quarter Since Early 2020",
  "text": "<p>That puts oil prices at a level more in line with where they were before Russia invaded Ukraine, a development that shocked energy markets and continues to loom over large around the globe.</p><p>Energy stocks have shed about a quarter of their value since hitting 2022 highs in June. Brent's third-quarter decline marks its worst three-month stretch since the quarter that ended in the pandemic panic of March 2020, when Brent's price fell about 60%. Drivers who paid more than $5 a gallon at the pump this summer are now paying less than $4.</p><p>In some ways, the decline is counterintuitive. Supply remains tight. Energy companies still haven't boosted production, and many buyers are still shunning Russian barrels.</p><p>\"It doesn't make sense, all things being equal, that oil prices would fall below what they were before the war because there's a shortage,\" said Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBIZ Investment Advisory Services.</p><p>But concerns about diminishing demand have taken center stage, fueling declines in everything from Exxon Mobil Corp. shares to jet fuel and diesel. Central banks around the globe are rapidly raising interest rates to cool inflation, hammering financial markets and slowing down the world economy. China, the world's second-largest economy and biggest consumer of commodities, is still under stringent Covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p>The strong U.S. dollar, surging alongside higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve seeks to put a lid on inflation, is adding to pressure on oil prices. Commodities become more expensive for overseas buyers when the dollar strengthens.</p><p>Traders are also nervous about slowing growth in China, the world's biggest consumer of commodities. The World Bank said this week it expects China's economy to expand 2.8% in 2022, down from a 4.3% forecast in June.</p><p>Still, Wall Street forecasts prices will rise. A bounceback in driving demand, continued underinvestment in capital expenditure by energy companies, lack of an agreement to get Iranian oil on the market and potential production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could send oil prices surging back to $101 during the fourth quarter of this year, JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote.</p><p>\"You're looking at a world where $80 for a barrel of oil is a really good deal,\" said Samuel Rines, managing director at CORBU, a research intelligence and advisory platform based out of Houston.</p><p>Meanwhile, the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine continues to ripple through markets. The Group of Seven wealthy nations rolled out a plan in early September to cap the price of Russian oil on global markets to limit Russia's revenue. The price cap would soften the European Union's plan for a total ban on Russian oil, set to go into effect later this year.</p><p>Many worry price volatility could extend into the year-end. The U.S. is set to end its Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases in October, an event analysts are watching closely.</p><p>One factor potentially supporting prices: U.S. oil-and-gas companies have prioritized returning profit to shareholders over expanding production capacity, pointing to limited supply. \"One of the real question marks out there is what happens with demand. I would tell you even at 2019 levels, the market is relatively tight,\" said Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods during last quarter's earnings call.</p><p>That sense is prompting some investors to wade deeper into the sector. Hennessy Funds' energy transition fund portfolio manager Ben Cook said the fund has increased its weighting in oil-and-gas companies relative to renewable-energy shares, estimating oil prices will rise because of low supply.</p><p>\"With our outlook for the commodity being fairly strong, we think equity performance will follow and we prefer those companies that provide good exposure to strength in the commodity,\" he said.</p>",
