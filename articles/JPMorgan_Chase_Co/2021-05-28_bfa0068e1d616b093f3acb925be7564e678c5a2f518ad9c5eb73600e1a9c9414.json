  "title": "Major Work Complete on New LIRR Hub",
  "text": "<p>\"This will make a major difference for Long Islanders,\" Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p>The station is expected to open by the end of next year.</p><p>Electrical and other work remains. So, too, does a monthslong process to teach drivers how to navigate the eight new miles of track between Queens and Manhattan, which includes crossing over some of the busiest rail lines in the U.S. The training is set to begin this summer.</p><p>The station will expand commuting options on the East Side for tens of thousands of LIRR riders who use New York Penn Station at 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues on Manhattan's west side.</p><p>Transportation officials expect 80,000 LIRR commuters to use the new connection, known as East Side Access.</p><p>Those projections were made before the pandemic forced millions of people in the region to work from home. Weekday LIRR ridership is about 65% below pre-pandemic norms, agency data show. Some transit agencies believe many suburban commuters will continue to work from home after the pandemic is over, at least a few days a week.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo said he is confident that riders will return if the LIRR, which is run by the state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority, delivers good service and amenities at the new station.</p><p>The MTA's construction and development officer, Janno Lieber, who walked the station with Mr. Cuomo, pointed out how the long concourse would allow commuters to spread out and relieve congestion. The concourse has multiple entrances and 17 escalators descending 140 feet to a mezzanine with access to eight tracks that can serve up to 24 trains an hour.</p><p>Two new buildings in the area, SL Green Realty Corp.'s One Vanderbilt and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s 270 Park Ave, will have direct access to the subterranean station.</p><p>At platform level Mr. Cuomo indicated that wall tiles and tracks have been engineered to absorb noise and make the place more pleasant.</p><p>Construction on the new station began about 15 years ago. The project was supposed to be completed in 2013. But the deadline was pushed back several times because of delays caused by construction challenges and the difficulty of coordinating work among dozens of contractors and three rail lines: the LIRR, Amtrak and NJ Transit.</p><p>Challenges included tunneling in loose soil beneath major city roads and elevated subway line footings, as well as rebuilding one of the nation's busiest passenger-rail interchanges, used by more than 600 trains a day.</p><p>In 2009, the project's cost was estimated at $7.3 billion. The most recent estimate, in 2018, put the cost at more than $11 billion.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo described the project as dormant when he took office in 2011. He said it has been the most difficult infrastructure project of his governorship. \"We inherited a pit, literally,\" he said. \"And we had to dig our way out.\"</p>",
