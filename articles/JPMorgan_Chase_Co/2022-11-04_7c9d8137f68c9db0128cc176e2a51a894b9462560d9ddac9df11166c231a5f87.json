  "title": "PayPal earnings report offers blasts from the past; A surprise announcement is a 'positive sign,' even as the company lowers its full-year revenue forecast",
  "text": "<p>The partnership narrative eventually became less of a talking point, in part because the company seemed to have tapped out the big players. But there was a surprise in Thursday's earnings report, with an announcement about greater cooperation with one more unexpected player: Apple Inc. AAPL.</p><p>Analysts were generally pleased to see that PayPal and Apple plan to play nice on numerous fronts, including with the inclusion of an Apple Pay button on PayPal's unbranded checkout and with forthcoming compatibility for PayPal's debit and credit cards within Apple's mobile wallet.</p><p>\"While these relationships are not likely to result in an economic benefit in the near term, we think that increasing the number of potential PayPal touch points, notably within in-person transactions where it has limited traction to date, can increase habituation for PayPal customers over time,\" wrote Morgan Stanley's James Faucette.</p><p>He said that the announcement comes as \"a positive sign to the market,\" since there was some expectation that PayPal and Apple would become more directly competitive. Rather, the latest arrangement \"indicates industry players are increasingly more likely to focus mainly on their core competencies and cooperate when they see fit.\"</p><p>UBS analyst Rayna Kumar added that amid \"the increasing competition in the space, we believe this partnership displays PayPal's ability to safeguard its competitive advantages, while expanding its reach.\"</p><p>But the latest earnings report also brought back memories of the PayPal of the past for a less positive reason, as the company once again lowered its full-year revenue forecast.</p><p>\"PayPal's 3Q results evoked feelings from two quarters ago when it reported better than feared results but cut guidance on macro concerns,\" explained JPMorgan's Tien-tsin Huang. \"Then, [the] stock rallied on a prudent guidance reset even though some feared the implied [second-half] growth ramp might not prove to be conservative enough. The skeptics appear to be right, and the stock's probably not going to rally this time because [second-half] growth is going to end up looking a lot like [the first half].\"</p><p>The stock was down about 7% shortly after Friday's open.</p><p>To be sure, there was also some fresh news in PayPal's last report, particularly around cost savings. Even as the revenue forecast underwhelmed, analysts seemed content with PayPal's early progress on recently announced expense-reduction initiatives as executives upped their full-year earnings forecast and gave guidance for at least 15% growth in next year's adjusted earnings per share.</p><p>Executives pointed out \"continued traction on what we believe to be the most important aspect of the PayPal story, namely, delivering margin expansion and consistent EPS growth through the cycle,\" wrote SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Andrew Bauch.</p><p>He added, however, that he and others \"would have preferred visibility around cost-saving opportunities incremental to the previously stated $1.3 billion [target for 2023], given the over-promise and underdeliver mistakes of 2021-2022, we suspect management was especially keen to remain conservative, particularly as the macro has only gotten worse.\"</p><p>PayPal earnings report offers blasts from the past</p>",
