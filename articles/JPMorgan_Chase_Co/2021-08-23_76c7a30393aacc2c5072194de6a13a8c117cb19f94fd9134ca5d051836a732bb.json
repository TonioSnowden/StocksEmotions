  "text": "<p>   And smaller problems were annoying: On Indigo's marketplace platform, certain crops that are typically measured in pounds or tons, such as rice and sunflowers, were listed by the bushel, leading farmers to reach for calculators. </p><p>   Mr. Jorgenson said problems with crop quantity listings had been fixed. He said that updates mean its systems can better manage the paper trail, and that letting buyers deal directly with farmers has streamlined the process. </p><p>   As Indigo's marketplace expanded, some farmers complained of delays in getting paid. Typically, sales to a local co-op or grain elevator would be paid within a matter of days, a critical time frame during periods when farmers are placing advance orders for seeds or supplies. Some farmers using Indigo's platform said they sometimes waited weeks or months for full payment. </p><p>   Jim Sheehan, who raises corn and soybeans with his family on nearly 17,000 acres near Pierre, S.D., said Indigo was late on payments in 2019 and throughout 2020, disrupting the farm's cash flow. At one point, Mr. Sheehan said, his father took a flight to Boston to make an in-person request for payment, but didn't get a meeting and left empty-handed. </p><p>   \"Farmers had high hopes for them bringing in new choices,\" he said. Indigo was \"probably too cavalier.\" </p><p>   Mr. Hovsepian said Indigo's marketplace now collects data needed for grain transactions in about one week and pays farmers in about two days. An Indigo spokesman said no current staff recalled the elder Mr. Sheehan's visit and that it was unfortunate no one met with him. </p><p>   Some of Indigo's investors said they warned the company that its ambitions were overly broad and costly. They wanted to see Indigo focus on making one or two of its ventures successful before pushing further into new lines of business. </p><p>    Robert Berendes, a Flagship executive partner and Indigo's chairman, said that the company's mission has stayed consistent as it has developed new businesses, and that it has quickly learned from mistakes. </p><p>   In spring 2019, Indigo announced its most ambitious venture so far: measuring the carbon that farm fields withdraw from the atmosphere and hold in the soil, creating carbon credits and selling them to companies looking to reduce their carbon footprint. </p><p>   It announced commitments from major companies last year, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and International Business Machines Corp., to purchase carbon credits through its system. The company said it has been finalizing data and plans to make its first carbon payments to farmers this fall, with credits sold to buyers next spring. </p><p>   Last year in an investor presentation, Indigo projected $1.1 billion in revenue for 2020, up from $223 million in 2019. Recently, the company declined to disclose actual 2020 revenue but said fourth-quarter 2020 was Indigo's biggest so far in revenue. </p><p>   Mr. Hovsepian said his first task as CEO was to call 25 farmers, apologizing to some for past mishaps. \"I got an earful,\" he said, calling the conversations constructive. Mr. Hovsepian, a longtime technology-industry executive, joined the company as acting chief operating officer in early 2020, before taking over as CEO. </p><p>   Mr. Hovsepian has overhauled Indigo's management team, hiring Mr. Jorgenson, who had previously worked in grain trading operations at Andersons Inc. and Cargill. Indigo brought on other executives who previously managed operations and logistics for digital retail and delivery companies Grubhub Inc. and Wayfair Inc. About three-quarters of field sales employees now come from agriculture backgrounds, the company said. </p><p></p>",
