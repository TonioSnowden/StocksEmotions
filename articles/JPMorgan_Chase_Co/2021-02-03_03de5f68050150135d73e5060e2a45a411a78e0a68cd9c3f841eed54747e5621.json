  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  What to Learn From Trump and the Experts?",
  "text": "<p>   Barton Swaim's \"Trump and the Failure of the Expert Class\" (op-ed, Jan. 23) describes how the \"experts\" got it wrong in 2016 because they were totally out of touch with the average American and misread the mood of the voter. The flashing light that should have been a signal to the pollsters, consultants and political pundits was the consistent 30%, plus or minus, support for Bernie Sanders and similar support for Donald Trump throughout the Democratic and Republican primaries. The conclusion to be drawn was that approximately 60% of all Americans were fed up with the establishment \"business as usual\" political system and were looking for drastic change either in the form of a self-avowed socialist or populist. When Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, it was no surprise that Bernie supporters either stayed home or voted for Donald Trump. </p><p>   Mr. Swaim points out the inability of experts who \"acknowledge no error,\" leaving little doubt they will continue to misread the mood of the American people. According to a December 2020 Gallup poll, Congress's approval rating was 15%, indicative of the public's disdain for how the government is being run. Antifa-encouraged riots, continued strong support for Sen. Sanders and his agenda and the 2020 election results showing President Trump received more votes (including those of African-Americans and Latinos) than any previous Republican should be a wake-up call for the Republican Party. If Republicans want to be relevant in future elections, they should recognize Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are tired of the status quo, which isn't working for them. </p><p>   Members of the expert class will continue to create their opinions within their own bubble of reinforcing data, leaving a wide-open political landscape for those willing to venture beyond those self-imposed constraints. </p><p>   Ken Dropek </p><p>   Houston </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Experts systematically examine raw data and draw logical conclusions which, in turn, form the basis for their expert opinions. Examples of experts include Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Francis Collins, Jamie Dimon and Janet Yellen. The point for emphasis is that Donald Trump did not value experts, but was happy only with those who agreed with his predetermined views. No one, not even a skilled writer like Mr. Swaim, can put lipstick on that pig. </p><p>   Dwight Oxley </p><p>   Wichita, Kan. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ever since the Vietnam War, America's experts from both parties have been wrong on many major issues. These authorities led us into and maintained the war on drugs and the war on terror, both of which continued far after it became apparent that they should be wound down. They told us housing prices never fall, so subprime mortgage lending was safe and wouldn't sink the economy. These experts gave short shrift to the impact that free trade and increased immigration (both legal and illegal) have had on Americans, especially those living outside large metropolitan areas. All these wrong forecasts had detrimental effects on the lives of average Americans, but not to the career prospects of these experts. </p><p>   Kurt Moeller </p><p>   Bethesda, Md. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Swaim can count himself among the failed expert class, if he doesn't consider President Trump's early-on bellowings that \"elections are rigged\" and \"the press is the enemy of the people\" to be an authoritarian attack on democracy. These and other warning signs -- the big lie of birtherism and the \"fine people\" at Charlottesville -- were there from the beginning. They were alarming, and they found their paroxysm on Jan. 6. </p><p>   Christopher Davis </p><p>   The Villages, Fla. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   What amazes me is that the Democrats still fail to get it. They believe Donald Trump's election was an anomaly that needed to be crushed so they could resume politics as usual. They learned nothing from the Tea Party movement. Americans don't want an elite ruling class. Mr. Trump may be gone but, as deplorable as we might be, Joe Sixpack will rise again. </p><p>   Jim Barber </p><p>   Mesa, Ariz. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   I hope to God that Mr. Swaim is right about a new generation of experts caring more about the truth and being more balanced. By all accounts, however, the farm system for the expert class is heavily stocked with more progressive and closed-minded experts than the ones they will replace. </p><p>   The next group of expert truth seekers were mentored by progressive educators, who outnumber conservatives on college campuses by as much as 10 to 1. They will be the ones populating think tanks, polling firms and newsrooms. Our democratic institutions survived Donald Trump, but our democratic republic remains under siege by those on the left who prefer a purer, majority-rule democracy run by experts. Mr. Swaim hopes the new experts will be wiser and more honest, but it is as likely that replacements will double down on progressive fundamentalism and self-righteousness. </p><p>   Pat Walsh </p><p>   Charleston, S.C. </p><p></p>",
