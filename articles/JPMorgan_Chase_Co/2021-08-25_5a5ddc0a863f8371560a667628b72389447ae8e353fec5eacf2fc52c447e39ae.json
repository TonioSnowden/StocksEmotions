  "title": "TPG Hires JPMorgan, Goldman for Its IPO  ----  By Miriam Gottfried, Corrie Driebusch and Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   TPG has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to underwrite its planned initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter, moving the private-equity powerhouse closer to a milestone it has flirted with for years. </p><p>   The Wall Street Journal reported in June that TPG was in the early stages of weighing a public listing that could value it at some $10 billion. </p><p>   The firm, which at the time was considering both a straightforward IPO and a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, is moving forward with the former and has been drafting paperwork it plans to file confidentially with regulators in the coming weeks, some of the people said. That could set up the shares to start trading by year-end. </p><p>   \"We continue to evaluate strategic alternatives and have nothing to announce at this time,\" a TPG spokesman said. </p><p>   With headquarters in San Francisco and Fort Worth, Texas, TPG manages nearly $100 billion in assets. The firm, one of the last of the original buyout giants to remain a private partnership, has considered launching an IPO at times in the past. </p><p>   This time, TPG seems determined to see the plan through -- though there is no guarantee, especially given that the red-hot IPO market could cool at any time. </p><p>    Jon Winkelried, who was president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman before joining TPG in 2015, became the firm's sole chief executive in May. Earlier this month, TPG named firm veteran Jack Weingart to the role of chief financial officer. </p><p>   Shares of publicly traded private-equity firms, including Blackstone Group Inc., KKR &amp; Co., Carlyle Group Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc., have been on a tear as their investment portfolios benefit from a rising stock market and they amass \"permanent capital,\" which generates steady management fees. </p><p>   TPG has scored big on early-stage investments in new-economy stalwarts including Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. </p><p>   Other private-market investment firms have seized the moment and staged IPOs. European private-equity firm Bridgepoint Group PLC listed shares in London last month, and Blue Owl Capital Inc. was formed in May through a merger with a SPAC. </p><p></p>",
