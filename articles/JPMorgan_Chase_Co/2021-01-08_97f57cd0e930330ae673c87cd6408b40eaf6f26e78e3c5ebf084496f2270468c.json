  "title": "Banks Still Have Cards To Play In Payments --- JPMorgan Chase deal suggests view on travel",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase recently acquired the global loyalty division of Loyalty Group Holdings, which serves credit-card rewards programs and helps connect them to ways that rewards can be used.</p><p>The move suggests in part that JPMorgan Chase sees travel and cards continuing a long-running association, and the deal includes travel services. Americans may have started using different cards or looking to find other uses for points in 2020. Lenders have responded by increasing rewards for grocery shopping and streaming. But many firms are betting that a pent-up desire for escape still exists, and spenders soon will be eager to use points again.</p><p>The deal is also notable for coming during the emergence of many technology players in payments and rewards. PayPal has been beefing up its platform that gives its users ways to use their card points, and investing in other inducements to shop, such as digital coupon-clipping service Honey. Meanwhile, part of buy-now-pay-later platform Afterpay's success is that shoppers can find merchants through Afterpay, rather than just the other way around. The company said this week that referrals to partner merchants this holiday season more than doubled versus the prior year through its Shop Directory service.</p><p>A risk of this emerging payments ecosystem to card issuers is that they become somewhat secondary to the e-commerce value chain. Even if people travel again, they might be shopping for that travel quite differently. By buying a rewards business, JPMorgan Chase can have a broader role.</p><p>The pandemic has shaken up spending and travel, and investors have bet that digital upstarts will be big winners. JPMorgan Chase's deal is a reminder that the card giants won't stay in lockdown.</p>",
