And if this has been forwarded to you, hello.&#xa0;Please sign&#xa0;up&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/newsletter-signup/swamp-notes\"><em>here</em></a><em>.&#xa0;</em></p> <p>In the past few days, we have heard increasingly urgent warnings about vaccine nationalism. A better term would be vaccine myopia. In theory, nationalists are putting their own country first — or continent, in the case of the EU. </p> <p>In a global pandemic that approach makes no sense. If protecting your people is a priority, as it must be, nationalist logic should endorse global vaccine equity. Either the west tackles coronavirus globally, or we totally wall ourselves off. “The prevailing combination of vaccine nationalism and half-open borders is a losing strategy,” <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/manaus-virus-highlights-rich-countries-self-interest-by-jean-pisani-ferry-2021-01\">argues Jean Pisani-Ferry</a>. “There is no effective middle way.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Sadly, that is where we are heading. Even if the EU fails to get the supply it expected of AstraZeneca's vaccine in the coming weeks, the continent has enough other sources to attain herd immunity by late 2021 (see my colleague Alan Beattie's excellent newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ee520dd-564b-47a3-932e-774c13dda185\">Trade Secrets</a>, for more on that). The same applies to America. If Joe Biden can meet his target of 1.5m shots a day over his first 200 days, America should reach herd immunity by the end of summer or early autumn. </p> <p>By contrast, the current expectation is for a fifth of the developing world to be vaccinated by the end of the year. And even that is in question. It would be better than nothing, but nowhere near good enough. The roughly 4bn people living in low- and middle-income countries would have to wait until 2023 or 2024 to reach post-Covid normality.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's the “catastrophic moral failure” to which the World Health Organization's head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, referred last week. But there is an equally large defeat of self-interest. As viruses spread, they mutate. In the past two months, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5691b1bb-0f9f-4410-9ade-84f4d55ea778\">three new variants</a> have emerged — from south-east England, South Africa and Manaus, Brazil. This is particularly concerning given the mutations could render existing vaccines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5691b1bb-0f9f-4410-9ade-84f4d55ea778\">less effective. </a></p> <p>If we allow billions of people to play the role of Petri dish on behalf of Covid-19 for another two or three years, how many other variants will emerge? What kind of hermetic sealing counts as an effective border control against a microbe? These questions answer themselves. There is no solution to coronavirus that is not global. As with any disease — but multiplied by 100 for Covid — prevention is far cheaper than cure. Independent forecasts say the world would lose roughly $9tn in output over the next two years if it failed to vaccinate developing countries. About half of that lost output, or $4.5tn, would fall on the west. That's about two years of trend growth.&#xa0;</p> <p>Compared to that, the cost of vaccinating the world is minute. Covax, the international vaccine alliance, is seeking $27bn to meet its 2021 goal of inoculating 2bn people. This is small change. Pisani-Ferry estimates it would cost $30bn to vaccinate three-quarters of the developing world at cost. Biden's pandemic relief bill, which is hanging in the balance, includes $400bn to boost the US vaccine rollout (and improve testing and contact tracing). </p> <p>The good news is that Biden wants to join the global effort. The US has belatedly joined Covax and reversed Donald Trump's withdrawal from the WHO. The bad news is that he faces political headwinds in appropriating money for the domestic rollout, let alone for the global effort. Europe, meanwhile, is threatening export controls on vaccine production. I know it's facile to poke holes at our low-calibre democratic performance. But the west is being presented with a textbook opportunity of enlightened self-interest at cut-price rates. Will we embrace it? Or are we too punch drunk to see beyond our own noses? Rana, how would you sell global vaccine equity to America?</p> <h1>Recommended reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Highly attentive Swampians may recall that I am <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e341fb5-269a-497a-a58d-4105071219a0\">researching a biography of Zbigniew Brzezinski</a>, one of America's great cold war architects (and much else besides). As a thoroughly civilised employer — and indeed, a practitioner of enlightened self-interest — the FT has kindly given me leave to research that biography. For the next six weeks, other writers, some of them colleagues, will spar with Rana in my place — starting with the inestimable Peter Spiegel, the FT's US managing editor. My only request is that he doesn't do it too well. Rana, could I rely on you ensure that Peter doesn't over-perform, as he undoubtedly will? I value my job security.</p></li>  <li><p>My <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d09049bf-e8fd-4b02-977f-b7e57d7acb7b\">column this week</a> warns Biden off America's increasingly fraught history wars between the 1619-ers and 1776-ers.&#xa0;“One narrative sees America as essentially good; the other as mostly bad,” I write. “This is no academic matter. When countries re-litigate yesterday, they are fighting over who owns tomorrow.”</p></li>  <li><p>My colleague Katie Martin, has an<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcfb2252-f752-4177-a860-07dc66b0b9e8\"> excellent primer</a> on the emergence of the Occupy Wall Street spirit among day traders — on Reddit and elsewhere. It struck me that GameStop is almost the perfect Freudian name for a game that never ends — the culture of hyper-speculation in a casino economy.</p></li>  <li><p>Finally, it was Holocaust Remembrance Day this week and I read this jaw-<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/opinion/jonas-noreika-lithuania-nazi-collaborator.html\">dropping piece by Silvia Foti </a>on her Lithuanian grandfather, a man she had been raised to see as a hero for his fight against the Soviets but who played a key role in rounding up the country's Jewish population during the German occupation. Her honesty is shockingly admirable.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h1>Rana Foroohar responds </h1> <p>Ed, this is a very powerful note that you are leaving on, and very persuasive. Sadly, it's an incredibly difficult time to sell average Americans on anything global, a topic that I explore in my own Monday column, which analyses the politics of Buy America.&#xa0;</p> <p>Part of this is about a pervasive sense that there's just so much to fix at home right now.&#xa0;According to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/12/17/6-views-of-foreign-policy/\">2019 Pew poll</a>,&#xa0;53 per cent of US adults say “it's best for the future of our country to be active in world affairs”, while 46 per cent say “we should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate more on problems here at home”.&#xa0;Part of it is about the usual bipartisan divides, particularly when it comes to overseas involvement:&#xa0;Democrats are more likely than Republicans (62 per cent vs 45 per cent) to say global engagement is best for the nation.&#xa0;</p> <p>I tend to fall a bit more than many of our colleagues into the “fix things at home first” camp. I think the best thing that Joe Biden could do to sell the US on global vaccine equity is to immunise every American as fast as possible, keep the economy on an even keel, and give people a sense that they can once again trust their own government. Once people feel more secure in their own prospects, I expect it will be easier to sell aid abroad.</p> <p>And don't worry, I'll never dump you for Peter (though I am looking forward to sparring with him, as we did in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/a4e53a70-5cc1-4a13-aa9b-72df5c2833e3\">election video series</a>. As we say in the Heartland, you got to dance with the one who brung ya!</p> <h1>Your feedback </h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc09362d-528c-47a1-b0b2-6b0544abe839\"><strong>‘Biden unleashed'</strong></a><strong>: </strong></p> <p>“Edward Luce writes that the Biden team wants to overhaul capitalism without first checking in with Jamie Dimon. If that happens, just how quickly will JPMorgan and other companies go back on their pledge of not funding the legislators who supported the attempted ‘coup'? Perhaps they'll recognise the relevance of the Utilitarian principle in their decision making, but I do not hold out hope.” <em>— Gail Berney, Duchess County, New York</em></p> <p>“Biden's short-term actions and future plans are very worrisome to me as a capitalist (and I was a labourer before I was a capitalist). One item that Ed mentioned that is especially worrisome is the new administration's engagement in a shift to ‘stakeholder capitalism'. If history was studied, one would find clear evidence of the failure of the ‘stakeholder governance models' and the concept of ‘stakeholder capitalism.' Post WWII, although the words may never had been spoken, the predominant governance model of US public companies was something akin to a stakeholder model. In an attempt to keep labour happy, wages spiralled out of control. And, as GE's Jack Welch found when he joined the Business Roundtable, the CEOs of America's largest companies had the lion's share of their focus on corporate social issues rather than commercial concerns. In short, major US public companies were&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;focused on maximising performance, competitiveness, profit or value. This approach to business appeared to be ‘working' but only because there was so little competition with Japan and most of Europe having been destroyed in WWII. In studying history, this lack of competition cannot be emphasised too strongly.” <em>— Henry D Wolfe, Chicago, Illinois </em>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Edward Luce  2021 'The west's vaccine myopia' FT.com 29 January.
