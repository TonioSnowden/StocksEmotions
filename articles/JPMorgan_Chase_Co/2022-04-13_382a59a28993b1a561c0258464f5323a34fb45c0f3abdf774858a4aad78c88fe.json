  "text": "<p>James Bullard, president of the St Louis branch of the Federal Reserve, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e759c33f-2515-4269-8c9b-e9e517d22a3d\">warned it is a “fantasy”</a> to think the US central bank can bring down inflation sufficiently without raising interest rates to a level where they constrain the economy.</p> <p>Bullard, a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee and one of its foremost hawks, said the central bank needed to be more aggressive in its efforts to root out the highest inflation in four decades as he called for rates to rise to a point where they actively curtail growth.</p> <p>That is the level at which rates neither fuel nor restrict economic activity and is estimated to be about 2.4 per cent. Bullard said the central bank would need to get beyond that threshold as quickly as possible this year if it wanted to bring inflation closer to the Fed's longstanding 2 per cent target.</p> <p>“There's a bit of a fantasy, I think, in current policy in central banks,” Bullard said in an interview with the Financial Times. “Neutral is not putting downward pressure on inflation. It's just ceasing to put upward pressure on inflation.”</p> <p>His comments came on the day it was confirmed that consumer price growth had surged to 8.5 per cent in March, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b075001b-5cab-4641-a483-f3e470953166\">its fastest pace since 1981</a>.</p> <p>However, there were signs that rises in “core” CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, were beginning to slow. It rose 0.3 per cent last month, the slowest rise since September and equivalent to an annual rise of 6.5 per cent.</p> <h1>Read more on US inflation</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Robert Armstrong breaks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7347f726-33f4-41fc-b133-7e8bd8bd6802\">down the inflation report</a> in his daily Unhedged email. He calls the report “surprisingly benign” and points to falling used car prices as one of the reasons for the lower than expected increase in core CPI.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you think core inflation has peaked?
