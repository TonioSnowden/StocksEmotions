  "title": "Gazprombank: The Big Russian Lender That Dodged Western Sanctions; European Union diplomats say they kept Gazprombank free from sanctions because payments on gas imports need to keep going",
  "text": "<p>Gazprombank is special. A bank created to serve the financial needs of Russia's Gazprom, one of the largest natural gas exporters in the world, Gazprombank is a vital part of the gas trade. It has also done business with close associates of President Vladimir Putin and has been embroiled in money-laundering troubles in Europe.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Should Gazprombank have been subject to sanctions? Why or why not?</p><p>Gazprombank's press office in Moscow didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>European Union diplomats say they kept Gazprombank free from sanctions because payments on gas imports need to keep going. The European Union last year imported 45% of its natural gas from Russia, equivalent to around $70 billion last year, according to Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank. EU officials said on Tuesday that they aim to cut that dependency by two-thirds this year, but it will take much longer to end it completely.</p><p>Gazprombank also avoided a ban on Swift, the financial-messaging infrastructure that links the world's banks, which is being cut off for seven other Russian banks. EU and U.S. leaders have also said they are ready to sanction more banks, without specifying which ones. </p><p>A Gazprombank bank branch in Moscow.

When Russia's economy crashed in 1998, leading to widespread bank failures, Gazprombank took over most of the gas export contracts with foreign countries, according to its 1998 annual report. That made it a key dealer of foreign currencies and link to the global financial system.</p><p>Gazprombank has correspondent-banking relationships with several Western banks, which enable it to move U.S. dollars, euros and other currencies on behalf of Russian clients. Foreign banks maintain accounts at banks in the U.S. and elsewhere to access those financial systems.</p><p>Listed correspondent banks include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Commerzbank AG. Gazprombank's arms in Switzerland and Luxembourg also have their own correspondent banks. The three also use one another for transactions.</p><p>Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Commerzbank declined to comment on Gazprombank. Deutsche Bank said in general, it may decide not to execute a payment, even coming from a non-sanctioned bank, if it considers it too risky. Bank of New York didn't reply to requests for comment.</p><p>Sparing Gazprombank from sanctions could open the door for the lender to become a conduit for businesses to and from Russia, a way to work around sanctions imposed on peers, according to sanctions consultants. Sanctioned VEB had an 8% stake in Gazprombank as of September, according to Gazprombank's most recent results report.</p><p>\"The point with leaving some banks open now is to allow gas payments to flow. But that also means channels are open for other payments that may not be those intended,\" said Cari Stinebower, a partner at law firm Winston &amp; Strawn in Washington, D.C. and former officer in the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces sanctions.</p><p>\"If you look at Iran and Venezuela, banks have become masterful at setting up front companies and layering transactions so that it is almost impossible to tell who the ultimate beneficiaries of the transfers are,\" Ms. Stinebower added.</p><p>While Gazprom is still its single largest customer, the bank has grown over the years and now has operations touching much of Russia's economy and connecting it to the West.</p><p>In Europe, Gazprombank has offices in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Cyprus where it provides financial services that can link Russian clients to the continent. Out of Luxembourg, it offers financing for private jets and yachts, according to its website. Within Russia it is one of the country's largest retail banks, with over 3 million customers.</p><p>The bank is also part of the larger Gazprombank Group that holds assets such as Škoda JS, which produces equipment for nuclear power plants in the Czech Republic, and a Russian media empire that owns major television channels, distribute movies and publishes celebrity magazines.</p><p>Several individuals who have done business with Gazprombank have been hit with sanctions over their ties to the Russian government or Mr. Putin. Its chief executive, Andrey Akimov, and chairman, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, were both designated officials of the Russian government by the U.S. Treasury in 2018 when their assets in the U.S. were frozen. Last month, the U.S. sanctioned another Gazprombank board member, Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov, chief executive of the country's state-owned diamond mining company and son of one of Mr. Putin's closest allies, according to the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>Spokespeople for Gazprom, Gazprombank and the diamond company didn't respond to requests for comment from the three executives.</p><p>One tycoon who was both a client and a former employee of Gazprombank is Kirill Shamalov, Mr. Putin's former son-in-law, according to the U.S. and U.K. governments. The Kremlin—which is tight-lipped about Mr. Putin's personal life—has long declined to confirm that the president's daughter was married to Mr. Shamalov. A former lawyer for Gazprombank, Mr. Shamalov is the son of a businessman said to be a longtime friend of Mr. Putin.</p><p>In 2014, Gazprombank financed Mr. Shamalov's purchase of a 17% stake in Sibur, a major Russian petrochemicals company. The deal made Mr. Shamalov, who was 32 at the time, Russia's youngest billionaire, according to Forbes. He later sold most of his stake, and Forbes estimated his net worth last year to be $800 million.</p><p>The U.K. imposed sanctions on Mr. Shamalov after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the U.S. sanctioned him in 2018. Reached by telephone, a spokeswoman for his company, Ladoga Management, asked for questions to be submitted in writing and didn't respond to an email.</p><p>Gazprombank isn't completely unsanctioned. The U.S. imposed limited restrictions on it in 2014 after Moscow took over Crimea, barring U.S. lenders from extending medium- or long-term financing to the bank. When the invasion started last month, the U.S. narrowed the window of financing allowed further to no longer than 14 days. While the move could complicate Gazprombank's business, it doesn't have the effects of full-fledged sanctions imposed on other banks that basically shut them off from the U.S. market.</p><p>In Switzerland, the financial regulator banned Gazprombank's local arm in 2018 from taking on new wealthy customers. It found the unit failed to carry out adequate checks on clients and transactions. This came after civil-enforcement proceedings sparked by the Panama Papers data leak in 2016, which included information on a Gazprombank Switzerland account held by a close associate of Mr. Putin.</p><p>Finma, the Swiss regulator, said the bank was in serious breach of its anti-money-laundering due diligence requirements for 10 years through 2016. It included a period when the bank belonged to another Russian lender.</p><p>Gazprombank said at the time that it accepted Finma's decision, adding its main business in Switzerland was corporate banking, and that it conducted limited business with private individuals. It said it had boosted compliance. The Finma ban expired and it started taking new clients again in 2021.</p><p>In February, Gazprombank's Swiss unit said Zurich's public prosecutor opened a criminal investigation into some unnamed employees. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office confirmed it has initiated proceedings against some employees, including the unit's chief executive, Roman Abdulin.</p><p>Mr. Abdulin didn't reply to requests for comment. Gazprombank said in February that the employees under investigation had the full confidence of the management and board.</p><p>—Margot Patrick and Laurence Norman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@wsj.com</p><p>Gazprombank: The Big Russian Lender That Dodged Western Sanctions</p>",
