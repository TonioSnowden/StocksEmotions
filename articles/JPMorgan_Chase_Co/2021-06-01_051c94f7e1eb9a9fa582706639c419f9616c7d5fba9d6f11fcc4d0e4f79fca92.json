Register for the free online event <a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/327337\">here</a>. (Don't forget to watch the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3b021684-5e03-4215-9c39-44aef5c3c848\">FT film</a> on the saga to get up to speed beforehand.)</p> <h2>Private equity diverges on post-pandemic plans</h2> <p>Trying to keep a score on Wall Street during the pandemic has been as difficult as writing theatre criticism during the ancient festival that Athenians called Dionysia.</p> <p>Like the Greek thespians who staged lavish outdoor performances every year to honour their god of wine, the performance of US private equity funds has been uniformly excellent.</p> <p>That's not to say they've all been following the same script, as DD's Mark Vandevelde <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/c6fe4f63-fa44-4c18-b763-b13523bff94e?\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Beginning in the first weeks of the crisis, <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, <strong>Blackstone </strong>and other private equity giants began deploying billions of dollars, hoping to gain an edge over their rivals by rolling out the distinctive playbooks they have perfected over many decades.</p> <p>Whether they invested in technology or food retail, bankrupt car rental companies or speculative electric vehicle ventures, just about anyone with money has earned a healthy return so far.</p> <p>But as America's great reopening gets into full swing, that may be about to change.</p> <p>Some are set to benefit from a resumption of normal life, having invested in airlines, car rental companies and travel agencies that could earn large windfalls if newly vaccinated Americans rediscover wanderlust after months of forced isolation.</p> <p>Others believe they have spotted lasting lifestyle changes inspired by the pandemic, the effects of which will be felt for years in healthcare, retail and beyond.</p> <p>After riding high for a year on a massive <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> stimulus that has lifted the value of a broad range of assets even as the economy faltered, investors are anxious to find out what strategy will earn the biggest rewards.</p> <h2>The brokers accused of a multimillion dollar fraud&#xa0;</h2> <p>Earlier this year, <strong>BGC Partners</strong>, the US interdealer broker run by the hard-charging <strong>Howard Lutnick</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f76e01ec-65cb-42bb-8dc9-9ee539c31585\">claimed</a> it had been the subject of a multimillion dollar fraud.&#xa0;</p> <p>The alleged perpetrators, accused of defrauding more than $35m from the company, were described as two former associates, but until now we didn't know their identity.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Friday, the FT's Kadhim Shubber and Philip Stafford <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f6635b8-5a81-4ffb-8c0c-43bb7de4ebf8\">revealed</a> that BGC had named the two UK-based employees in a civil lawsuit in London. The broker accused <strong>Michael Viney</strong> and <strong>Xavier Alcan</strong> of funnelling cash due to or from the UK tax authorities into their own pockets between 2015 and 2020, according to the court filing.&#xa0;</p> <p>The lawsuit claims Alcan, a senior broker, “encouraged” Viney, a tax adviser, to facilitate the fraud and bought Viney “extravagant items including holidays, electronics and luxury designer jewellery”.</p> <p>According to the suit, the money may have been used to buy <strong>Cartier</strong> and <strong>Bulgari </strong>jewellery and some 18 properties in England. <strong>Hallelujah King</strong>, Viney's girlfriend, is also named as a third defendant by BGC, which claims some of the assets may have gone to her.</p> <p>It appears no defence has yet been filed for Alcan or King. Viney's defence was filed recently but is not yet publicly available.&#xa0;</p> <p>If Alcan's name sounds familiar, city veterans might remember <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/cantor-court-told-of-whoring-6334315.html\">his colourful comments</a> as a witness in a 2002 lawsuit between <strong>Cantor Fitzgerald</strong> (another firm run by Lutnick) and rival <strong>ICAP</strong>.</p> <h2>Wall Street and China's star-crossed romance</h2> <p>Last week DD chronicled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91f242f4-dee1-47d4-95b8-74832a0834fb\">a tale of two Chinas</a>. In one, a bitter geopolitical feud bubbles between Beijing and Washington, exacerbated by a Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57174621-3863-42b0-a39a-a36801fd7481\">probe</a> into the origins of the coronavirus.&#xa0;In the other, Wall Street rakes in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bba86de5-1da4-4b5a-bb40-6ff71c18cb7b\">bumper fees</a> from equity deals on Chinese companies, and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> leads the wealth management gold rush to strike it big on the country's growing household <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfa56fcc-e345-4c17-b988-b1194b3d9ab5\">wealth</a>.</p> <p>The US lender's recently unveiled alliance with<strong> ICBC</strong>, one of China's largest banks, has gained initial approval from regulators. It could soon reap the potential of hundreds of millions in savings from the bank's Chinese customers. In China, huge quantities of household savings have historically sat uninvested in bank deposits or chased returns in the property market.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fd79007-e556-4f04-aa6e-43557652890f\"><strong>BlackRock</strong></a> has its own deal in the works, while <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has plans to invest $415m in <strong>China Merchants Bank</strong>'s wealth unit, adding more of Wall Street's biggest names to an investment market currently dominated by the Chinese banking sector.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an era of flaring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf71feb2-297f-4e3a-8627-b89931cc6a80\">geopolitical tensions</a>, how can these realities exist on the same plane?&#xa0;</p> <p>As the FT's Thomas Hale and colleagues describe in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">Big Read</a>, the opportunity is simply too large for US banks to resist. Goldman expects there to be $70tn of investable assets across the country's households by 2030, for which it plans to eventually offer “cross border” products, among others.</p> <p>The prospect of a retirement crisis in China amplifies the need for a new path forward, which Wall Street is happy to help forge. This week, in a sign of its concerns over an ageing population, Beijing announced a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc884ee0-94d9-4e2a-ad4b-14329a7a253f\">three-child policy</a> that contrasts sharply with decades of tighter control over the birth rate.</p> <p>But amid grand plans for growing foreign involvement in China's wealth management landscape, where the country's banks currently dominate, uncertainty lingers — especially when it comes to geopolitics.</p> <p>“China is too big a market to ignore, but at the back of your mind is the thought, ‘What can go wrong?',” Morningstar senior equity analyst<strong> Greggory Warren</strong> told the FT. “In China, the rules and attitudes can change overnight.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Goldman's boss David Solomon seemed aware of potential complications in a congressional hearing last Thursday, acknowledging that the US-China relationship is “incredibly complex”.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Celeste Mellet Brown</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210528005066/en/Evercore-Names-Celeste-Mellet-Brown-as-Next-Chief-Financial-Officer\">was named</a> chief financial officer at <strong>Evercore</strong>, the first woman to hold the position at the New York investment bank. Mellet Brown was previously CFO of <strong>Fannie Mae</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>After nine years in the role, <strong>Rich Lesser </strong>will step down as chief executive of <strong>Boston Consulting Group </strong>to enter the role of global chair. He will be replaced by the firm's head of central and eastern Europe <strong>Christoph Schweizer</strong> in October.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Acquired taste </strong>The Michelin restaurant guide, which has been around since the 1900s, is seen as a bible in the culinary world. But some have levelled accusations that the restaurant ratings are a kind of Francophile cultural police. (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e622ec53-ea9f-487a-a434-747f13f5ffa0\">FT</a>)</p> <p><strong>Dealers' dilemma </strong>The respective downfalls of Wirecard and Greensill Capital revealed a little-discussed paradox of modern finance: such risk-hungry start-ups rely on the stability of traditional banks. Lenders benefit from the system, but it could put their depositors at risk. (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f535f974-38c6-42df-86b4-646e025ed2da\">FT</a>)</p> <p><strong>The great pizza debate </strong>Delivery apps such as DoorDash and Uber Eats have revolutionised food delivery. But the original pioneer of the concept — the pizza industry — is torn over whether to embrace these apps or cut their own slice of the corporate pie. (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pizza-business-is-divided-on-delivery-11622367002?mod=cxrecs_join#cxrecs_s\">WSJ</a>)</p> <h2>News round-up&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a59555b-765e-4cec-bcb7-b642d0e68a9c\">Credit Suisse compliance chief was warned about Gupta</a> (FT)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70ba7bbf-85e5-444f-a995-9dc807342d4d\">UK and European funds shun Deliveroo</a> (FT)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-warned-deutsche-bank-over-anti-money-laundering-backsliding-11622390670?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">Fed warned Deutsche Bank over anti-money-laundering backsliding</a> (WSJ)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb85b921-023d-4aeb-a83c-e81757e922d2\">Hong Kong exempts finance executives from virus quarantine rules</a> (FT)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autostrade-m-a-atlantia/italy-takes-back-motorways-as-atlantia-investors-approve-sale-idUSKCN2DC143\">Italy takes back motorways as Atlantia investors approve sale</a> (Reuters)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85a1c58d-a082-4bf8-901b-27ee6f63cdd2\">Robinhood: latest offer is more sound bite than money spinner</a> (Lex)</p> <p><a href=\"https://ft.com/content/426cd09b-6d57-4364-a27d-000fbc2eb718\">Crowdcube to launch IPO platform for retail investors</a> (FT)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/porsche-piech-families-weigh-direct-stake-possible-porsche-ipo-sources-2021-05-31/\">Porsche, Piech families weigh direct stake in possible Porsche IPO</a> (Reuters)</p><p>Source:  2021 'Back to the future: private equity predicts life after lockdown' FT.com 1 June.
