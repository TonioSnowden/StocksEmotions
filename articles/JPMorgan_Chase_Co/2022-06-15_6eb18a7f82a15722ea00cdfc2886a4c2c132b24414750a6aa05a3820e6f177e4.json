  "title": "Chinese Bond Market Records Fourth Month of Foreign Outflows; International investors' holdings of yuan-denominated bonds have fallen by $61 billion since February",
  "text": "<p>The pullback is easily the largest since the Chinese bond market was made more accessible to foreigners in mid-2017, with the launch of the Bond Connect trading link with Hong Kong. The move, coupled with the addition of Chinese debt to influential indexes, helped spur a surge in inbound buying.</p><p>International investors last month reduced their bond positions by a total of 109.4 billion yuan, equivalent to about $16.2 billion, a similar amount to April, according to data from two clearinghouses, the China Central Depository &amp; Clearing Co. and the Shanghai Clearing House.</p><p>Foreign investors began paring their holdings of Chinese bonds the same month that Russia invaded Ukraine, which created concerns around the geopolitical risks of investing in China. In April, yields on Chinese government bonds fell below the yields on equivalent U.S. Treasurys for the first time in more than a decade, removing a key attraction for foreign investors in Chinese debt.</p><p>Chinese government-bond yields have been rangebound this year while Treasury yields have soared, thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate increases to combat persistently high inflation. As of Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury note yielded 3.385%, versus the 2.841% yield on the 10-year Chinese government bond, according to Tullett Prebon data.</p><p>Extended Covid-19 lockdowns in China have also weighed heavily on growth in the world's second-largest economy, making Chinese bonds less appealing to investors. Since mid-April, the yuan has weakened rapidly, and on May 12, it slid to more than 6.82 to the dollar, its lowest point since September 2020. It has since recovered some to trade at 6.71 per dollar.</p><p>Foreigners' positions in Chinese bonds totaled the equivalent of $542.8 billion at the end of May, their lowest level in a year, according to CCDC.</p><p>Arthur Lau, head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, said his firm has been underweight Chinese government debt and policy-bank bonds since the start of this year. \"The rate trajectory in China is a completely different story from the U.S.,\" he said, adding that he expects Treasury yields to climb further this year as the Fed raises rates to combat inflation.</p><p>China's macroeconomic environment, on the other hand, \"continues to be very weak, and the slowdown is gathering pace,\" he said. While Beijing is expected to ease policy and increase government spending to arrest the downturn, Chinese bond yields are unlikely to move much, he predicted.</p><p>The yuan could also weaken, which would hurt returns for dollar-based investors such as PineBridge, he added. \"We don't think it's a good time to increase our positions in local government bonds because of the FX concern.\"</p><p>The calculus is different for bond investors that are focused on Asia's emerging markets, said Jason Pang, a senior portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. While a U.S. dollar-based index of Chinese government bonds is down about 2.6% this year on a total-return basis, it has performed better than government bond indexes for most other countries.</p><p>\"As an Asian investor you would not be better off being underweight China versus the rest of the region,\" Mr. Pang said, adding that his firm remains invested in Chinese government debt.</p><p>Foreign holdings are largely, but not entirely, composed of Chinese government bonds and of bonds issued by large government-backed lenders known as policy banks.</p><p>May's decrease included a net reduction of 14 billion yuan in foreigners' holdings of onshore Chinese government bonds, figures released on Wednesday by the CCDC showed. International investors also sold a net 74.63 billion yuan of notes issued by policy banks.</p><p>The continued outflow happened despite Chinese regulators' recent effort to boost foreign investors' interests in the Chinese bond market. On May 27, the People's Bank of China, China Securities Regulatory Commission and State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued a directive to further open up the Chinese bond market to foreign investors.</p><p>They said that starting from June 30, foreign investors will be allowed to invest in onshore exchange-based bond markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as accessing the interbank debt market in which they are already trading.</p><p>Write to Cao Li at li.cao@wsj.com and Serena Ng at serena.ng@wsj.com</p><p>Chinese Bond Market Records Fourth Month of Foreign Outflows</p>",
