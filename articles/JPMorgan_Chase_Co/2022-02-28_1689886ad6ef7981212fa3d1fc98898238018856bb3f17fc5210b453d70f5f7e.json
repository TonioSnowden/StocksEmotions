  "text": "<p>Canada's TD Bank Group has agreed to buy US regional rival First Horizon for $13.4bn, a move that will turn the Toronto-headquartered bank into the sixth-largest lender in America.</p> <p>TD Bank will pay First Horizon shareholders $25 per share in cash, a 37 per cent premium on the US bank's closing stock price on Friday. As part of the deal announced on Monday, First Horizon's chief executive Bryan Jordan will join TD as vice-chair, while TD's head of US retail banking Leo Salom will lead the combined group. </p> <p>Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries have been on a buying spree in the US since the mid-2000s as it spent billions of dollars to amass assets and become a leading consumer banking player across North America. It first acquired Banknorth of Maine in 2004 and later went on to acquire Hudson United for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c4fce86-f2cf-11d9-8094-00000e2511c8\">$1.9bn in 2005</a> and Commerce Bancorp <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90415c6c-70ee-11dc-98fc-0000779fd2ac\">for $8.9bn in 2007</a>.</p> <p>Canadian banks have been aggressively expanding in the US in recent years as stringent regulation for large US rivals has made it easier for financial institutions north of the border to act as consolidators of the fragmented American banking industry. </p> <p>Large US regional banks, including PNC Financial and BB&amp;T, have also sought to consolidate by buying smaller rivals. PNC acquired the US operations of Spain's BBVA for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42a97547-d857-465d-afd3-7f5b7c9c4d74\">$11.6bn in 2020</a>, creating the fifth-largest bank in America, and a year earlier <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0330a7e0-2aca-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8\">BB&amp;T combined with SunTrust</a> to form a large financial institution across the east coast of America. </p> <p>Bharat Masrani, chief executive of TD Bank Group, said the First Horizon acquisition “provides TD with immediate presence and scale in highly attractive adjacent markets in the US with significant opportunity for future growth across the south-east.”</p> <p>The addition of the Memphis-based regional bank will bolster the US assets of the Canadian bank to $614bn, with a network of 1,560 branches and almost 11mn consumers. First Horizon has a strong presence in the south, particularly in Tennessee and Louisiana as well as in Florida, the Carolinas and Virginia. It also has a foothold in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as in Dallas and Houston, two wealthy Texas markets.</p> <p>TD Securities and JPMorgan served as financial advisers to TD Bank and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett and Torys acted as legal advisers to TD. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to First Horizon and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell served as legal adviser.</p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan in London 2022 'TD increases US presence with $13.4bn acquisition of First Horizon' FT.com 28 February.
