  "title": "Markets & Finance: Green Investors See Growth Story for European Banks",
  "text": "<p>In theory, a boom in lending to and advising companies spending on renewable energy or cutting carbon emissions could open up a new source of demand. Some see Europe's green push as a differentiator for the region's lenders, giving them expertise in an area that American rivals might be less focused on.</p><p>HSBC Holdings PLC plans to provide as much as $1 trillion of financing to reduce carbon emissions by 2030. Barclays plans to provide $138 billion of green financing by 2030, while Deutsche Bank has pledged $235 billion of sustainable finance by the end of 2023.</p><p>Financing renewable power generation and other low-carbon projects could generate more than $6 billion of additional annual revenues for listed European banks and lift their share prices by as much as 20%, according to Autonomous Research, a unit of AllianceBernstein.</p><p>Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. said this year that financing the transition to a low-carbon economy could be a rare growth story for European banks and might add 2% annual loan growth in the next decade.</p><p>\"Autonomous and KBW are no fools,\" Federico Wynne, senior cross-asset analyst at Fidelity International, which manages more than $600 billion, said in an interview. \"They are clearly looking beyond the current investment horizon and telling investors: 'Wake up. This is a big opportunity for banks. Banks are cheap.\"'</p><p>Fidelity owns shares in banks including Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered PLC.</p><p>To be sure, markets have been slow to factor in potential gains from green lending, in part because they are hard to measure.</p><p>\"Financing the transition to a low-carbon economy is a long-dated process and there are many other factors that are more relevant today, especially Covid and interest-rate risks, but in the long run this is likely to be positive for banks,\" Justin Bisseker, European banks analyst at Schroders PLC, a London-based fund manager with $968 billion of assets under management, said.</p><p>So far only London-based emerging markets lender Standard Chartered discloses information about green financing income, according to Autonomous. The bank said sustainable financing revenue rose 55% in the first half of 2021 compared with the same period last year, without giving more information.</p><p>Autonomous estimates Standard Chartered's annualized revenue from sustainable financing at $250 million, small compared with the bank's $15 billion revenue base. The bank has a medium-term target of $1 billion of annual sustainable financing revenue.</p><p>A Standard Chartered spokeswoman said the bank would announce details of its plans to transition to more green lending later this year.</p><p>European bank shares have long lagged behind their American peers, with most trading at a significant discount to their book value, a common metric looked at by investors. The region's top seven banks together have a combined market value of around $467 billion, equal to the size of one U.S. lender, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>European financial regulators are pushing banks to cut the carbon dioxide emissions they finance and to boost renewable energy. They have urged bankers and investors to see the commercial opportunity as well as the environmental benefit.</p><p>Standard Chartered and HSBC stand to gain because they are regulated in Europe but have large corporate banking operations in Asia, a region with significant green financing requirements, according to Autonomous.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
