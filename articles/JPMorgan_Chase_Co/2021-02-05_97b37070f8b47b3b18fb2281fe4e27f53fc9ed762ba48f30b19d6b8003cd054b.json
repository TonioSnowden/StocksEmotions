  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, vaccine rollouts are ramping up in the U.S., offering hope that there may be a sharp economic rebound later in the year.</p><p>A handful of stocks that grew popular on online forums and posted big swings in recent days have also calmed.</p><p>\"The move now is for cautious optimism: The market is turning back to fundamentals,\" said Grace Peters, an investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank . \"Volatility is here to stay, but markets will ultimately grind higher.\"</p><p>The broad stock market index ticked up 41.57 points, or 1.1%, to 3871.74, its sixth record close of 2021. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 167.20 points, or 1.2%, to 13777.74, also a high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 332.26 points, or 1.1%, to 31055.86, off 0.4% from its Jan. 20 peak.</p><p>The latest data on jobless claims showed that 779,000 people applied for initial benefits last week, a decline from the previous week, but still at a historically high level.</p><p>Cold weather, a surge in Covid-19 case numbers and the threat of a new, highly contagious variant of the virus have contributed to a broader winter slowdown that has hindered the labor market's recovery, economists say.</p><p>Investors are awaiting the next steps on a new fiscal stimulus package in the U.S.</p><p>In a Wednesday evening call with House Democrats, President Biden said he is willing to send the next round of checks to a smaller, more targeted group of people.</p><p>\"I think that flexibility is a good thing,\" said Mrs. Peters, since it could improve the chances of passing the next stimulus bill in a timely manner.</p><p>\"The market is expecting around $1 trillion; anything more than that could be positive for equities,\" she added. \"This is one of the tailwinds we're looking for to support growth through the second quarter and beyond.\"</p><p>In corporate news, e-commerce giant eBay jumped $3.08, or 5.3%, to $61.12, after the company's profit climbed, beating analysts' projections.</p><p>PayPal rose $18.53, or 7.4%, $270.43, after reporting its earnings tripled from a year earlier. Chip maker Qualcomm slid $14.33, or 8.8%, to $147.97, after it posted revenue that came slightly below expectations and said its results were hit by supply constraints.</p><p>\"The tech earnings so far have been really quite impressive,\" said Will Rhind, founder and chief executive of GraniteShares. \"I think our sort of broader thesis is still very much intact, which is this is an economy that is very much made up of winners and losers. And the winners for the most part are those that have a digital strategy or a strategy that enables them to survive in an increasingly digital world.\"</p><p>GameStop fell $38.91, or 42%, to $53.50. The videogame retailer has been among a handful of stocks that soared in popularity among day traders in recent days, and Thursday's move reflects the dwindling frenzy.

This is just a very typical thing,\" said Mr. Rhind.</p><p>Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, ticked up 0.7% to $58.84 a barrel.</p><p>Oil prices have been buoyed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ' statement Wednesday asking countries to stick with production cuts given the uncertain market conditions, said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic bank SEB Group.</p><p>\"What they are doing is driving down inventories and driving prices higher,\" Mr. Schieldrop said.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.6%. In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei was up 1.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.8% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.7%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.2%.</p><p>In currency markets, the WSJ Dollar Index, which compares the greenback against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.35 point, or 0.4%, to 86.21.</p>",
