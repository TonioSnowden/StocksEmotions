  "text": "<p>A US federal banking regulator has dropped its case against two former London-based bank traders just months before they were due to stand trial, ending an eight-year battle concerning allegations they tried to fix prices in the global foreign exchange market.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had brought the case against Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan Chase, and Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, in 2017, at the same time as they were charged in a US criminal indictment. </p> <p>Usher and Ramchandani were later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e192f6e-d7a5-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8\">acquitted</a> of a single charge of price-fixing by a jury in New York federal court in 2018. </p> <p>The OCC's regulatory case focused on to what extent the traders engaged in “unsafe” or “unsound” practices. The regulator sought to ban them from the banking industry and levy $1.5m fines against each.</p> <p>On Wednesday the OCC abandoned the case, drawing a line under the allegations of price-fixing against the two men.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ramchandani's lawyer Heather Nyong'o said: “As we have been telling the OCC for years, there was no merit to their case and no factual basis to continue to bring it. It is unheard of for OCC cases that are this close to trial to get dismissed with prejudice. But our client did nothing wrong, and has now been vindicated.”</p> <p>Usher's lawyer Jonathan Pickworth said: “This is a complete and total exoneration for Mr Usher.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The OCC chose to pursue a meritless case against an honest, hard-working, highly successful British trader, who lived and worked in London,” he said. “At long last, following a thorough testing of the facts and expert evidence in depositions, the OCC has realised that the allegations were baseless.”</p> <p>The case against the two men had been set to go to trial later this year. They had been taking part in joint depositions in recent weeks when the OCC dropped the case.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another of Usher's lawyers, Mark Gidley, who represented him in the civil and criminal proceedings, said: “After many years of defending his conduct before a US jury and now these extensive administrative proceedings, we are grateful that the OCC has moved unilaterally to dismiss all of its charges against Mr Usher.”<br><br><br></p><p>Source: Kate Beioley in London  2021 'US regulator drops case against two former forex traders ' FT.com 8 July.
