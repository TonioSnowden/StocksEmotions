  "title": "Biden Nominee for Fed's Top Banking Regulator Confirmed as Fed Governor; Confirmation gives central bank a full seven-member board; Senate set to vote to consider Barr for key regulatory post",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Barr's confirmation provides the central bank with a full seven-member board for the first time in nearly a decade and would add to a group of Biden-appointed financial watchdogs. Mr. Barr has a record that suggests he might seek to restore at least some of the financial rules that were eased by the Fed during the Trump administration.</p><p>A dean of public policy at the University of Michigan, Mr. Barr is the last of Mr. Biden's slate of five appointees to the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and three other appointments were confirmed in recent months.</p><p>The supervision role that Mr. Barr is set to fill is responsible for developing a broad vision for the regulation of big banks and other financial firms. That includes developing policy recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Randal Quarles, who previously held the Fed supervision post, focused on simplifying financial regulations enacted after the 2008-09 financial crisis, moves that supporters have said clarified or better calibrated the central bank's rules but that some Democrats said significantly softened the impact of the Wall Street rulebook. Mr. Quarles left the Fed in December.</p><p>Mr. Barr is expected to weigh in on a Biden administration push to review the way regulators assess the mergers of large banks, a process in its early stages that could make bank tie-ups more difficult.</p><p>Friends and former colleagues said that if Mr. Barr does try to change direction at the Fed, they expect he will take a collaborative and pragmatic approach. An academic known for his work on financial inclusion and consumer advocacy, Mr. Barr had stints in the Treasury Department during the Clinton and Obama administrations, including as a top lieutenant to then Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Mr. Barr played a role as an architect of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.</p><p>Analysts said they expect Mr. Barr would likely pursue relatively modest steps to strengthen bank stress tests rather than wholesale revisions to the annual exercise to test whether large lenders are able to withstand a severe recession. Stress test results now feed into banks' capital requirements for the ensuing year.</p><p>\"He will be a thoughtful and effective leader, but we should be expecting his tenure to produce a series of targeted tweaks rather than a wholesale revision of the regulatory regime,\" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at financial-services firm BTIG.</p><p>Mr. Barr said at a May hearing that he wanted to get a broad view of various bank-capital and liquidity requirements before pushing for adjustments to specific rules.</p><p>Brandon Barford, a partner at research firm Beacon Policy Advisors, said Mr. Barr will have to navigate the bank-merger issue by working with the Democratic heads of other agencies, notably at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., who have called for tougher merger guidelines. Mr. Barr's views on the matter weren't made clear in his confirmation hearing.</p><p>\"I think it will be a pretty big fight as Barr looks to protect the Fed's prerogative over mergers, but also has to work with other regulators who have proved they are not afraid to break norms in order to try to push regulation further left,\" Mr. Barford said.</p><p>Mr. Barr's confirmation is a victory for the Biden administration after multiple regulatory nominees failed to gain traction in the evenly divided Senate. Mr. Biden's first nominee for the Fed banking-supervision post, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew from consideration in March after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, said he couldn't support the nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.</p><p>Another top pick, Saule Omarova, in December withdrew from consideration for Comptroller of the Currency, a separate job overseeing large national banks. She faced objections from both Republicans and some Democrats.</p><p>The Biden administration had planned to nominate Mr. Barr for the comptroller position shortly after Mr. Biden's inauguration last year, but some progressive Democrats succeeded in torpedoing that plan, citing his advisory ties to financial-technology firms. Mr. Barr's Fed role is much more influential than the comptroller position, both domestically and with overseas counterparts.</p><p>Bank lobbyists say they don't expect the White House to nominate someone else for the comptroller role, or as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., before November's midterm elections.</p><p>Both agencies are currently run by Democrats appointed by the White House on an acting basis who can continue to serve in that capacity, without Senate confirmation. A White House spokesman had no immediate comment.</p><p>An early test of Mr. Barr's approach could come from the way he proposes to treat Treasurys and deposits banks hold at the central bank under capital requirements known as the supplementary leverage ratio. The Fed allowed a temporary, pandemic-related reprieve from the capital requirements to expire last year, but promised to propose a broader revamp to the rule's treatment of ultrasafe assets. It has yet to do so.</p><p>Senior Democrats such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) and House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) have said any extension of the relief would be a mistake, weakening the postcrisis regulatory regime. Republicans and banks generally pressed for an extension.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Nominee for Fed's Top Banking Regulator Confirmed as Fed Governor</p>",
