  "title": "Cross Country: Federal Unemployment Bonus Holds the Recovery Back",
  "text": "<p>What explains the turnaround? In May, Gov. Asa Hutchinson decided to opt Arkansas out of the extra $300 in weekly unemployment benefits the federal government is offering. Before the announcement, Arkansas was still down 32,000 jobs compared with February 2020. Considering the recession had officially ended more than a year earlier, in April 2020, something was clearly blocking the recovery.</p><p>According to research published by the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Institute, because of the supplemental $300 a week, 48% of American workers made at least as much in unemployment benefits during the pandemic as they did while working. At the start of May, the number of people collecting unemployment in Arkansas was still nearly twice as high as it was before the pandemic started -- yet at the same time, the state's employers had a record 80,000 job openings.</p><p>People can do the math. The prospect of making more money by staying home than going to work was an offer many felt they couldn't refuse. That's why ending the unemployment bonus has done a world of good. Using original data provided by the Arkansas Division of Workforce Services, the Foundation for Government Accountability, where I work, recently found that job-search activity increased as soon as the extra unemployment bonus stopped. In the two weeks following the June 26 cutoff, the state's job-matching system saw a 28% increase in new daily registrations. Over 14 days in late June and early July, nearly 20,000 Arkansans registered to find work through the system.</p><p>Better yet, many more Arkansans found work. Between Mr. Hutchinson's early-May announcement and mid-July, employers hired nearly 160,000 workers, thousands of them after the extra payments expired. Once the bonus was no longer available, companies were filling roughly 2,600 jobs a day -- nearly twice as many as they were before.</p><p>Obviously, the boom in jobs is good for workers and families. Every person who goes from unemployment to a job is on a better path in life. But what's good for workers is also good for taxpayers. Our analysis shows that total state and federal unemployment spending dropped by 90% in Arkansas after the bonuses went away. When was the last time you heard of a 90% drop in government spending?</p><p>The turnaround has been noticeable across Conway and, by all accounts, every corner of the state. Arkansas was right to end the extra unemployment bonus, and President Biden and Congress were wrong to extend it in March. The policy held workers and businesses back at a time when the state and the country needed their energy to move the economy forward.</p><p>The bonus is set to expire for everyone on Sept. 6. But that isn't a sure thing. Mr. Biden has gone from openness to extending the policy to passive opposition, with the administration saying in a letter to Congress that the payments should end. Yet lawmakers still feel pressure to keep the money flowing as the Delta variant spreads. In its letter, the Biden administration also urged states to use some of the $350 billion they got in the American Rescue Plan to keep the higher payments going, maybe indefinitely. The White House clearly thinks the bonus was a good idea, despite the evidence.</p><p>My town, and my state, prove this path isn't worth taking. As important, they show there's a better path -- one that empowers businesses to thrive and families to rise.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Horton is research director at the Foundation for Government Accountability.</p>",
