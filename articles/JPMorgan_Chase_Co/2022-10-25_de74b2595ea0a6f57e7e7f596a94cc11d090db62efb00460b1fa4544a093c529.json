  "text": "<p>HSBC Holdings PLC reported a 46% drop in third-quarter profit and named a veteran banker as its new chief financial officer, putting him in the mix as a possible successor to the top job at the global banking giant.</p><p>London-based HSBC, Europe's largest bank by market value, said profit was reduced by a one-time hit from the sale of its French retail unit. Profit was also damped because the bank socked away cash to prepare for potential pickups in bad loans in the U.K. and in China's property markets.</p><p>The bank said that, otherwise, it continues to benefit broadly frominterest-rate increases by central banks. These have boosted the income HSBC earns from interest paid by consumers and businesses.</p><p>The lender is nearly three years into a broad restructuring, during which it has retrenched from North America and parts of Europe to shift resources to Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>The bank appointed Georges Elhedery, 48 years old, as its new finance chief. He is succeeding Ewen Stevenson, who is stepping down from the job at the end of the year and leaving the bank in April.</p><p>Mr. Elhedery is currently the co-chief executive of HSBC's global banking and markets team, which will now be run solely by Greg Guyett. The bank said it made the change after reviewing its executive committee with a focus on succession planning.</p><p>HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn said that he plans to remain in his role for years to come but that the bank had reached an inflection point to start looking for potential successors.</p><p>\"There is no change to my commitment as a consequence to these people moves,\" Mr. Quinn told reporters Tuesday. He called Mr. Elhedery \"an exceptional leader\" in a statement.</p><p>HSBC's profit fell to $1.9 billion in the July-through-September quarter from a year earlier, the bank said Tuesday. Analysts had expected it to report about $1.15 billion in profit, according to estimates compiled by the bank.</p><p>The bank took a $2.4 billion charge tied to the planned sale of its French retail-banking operations, a disposal that is part of its pivot to Asia.</p><p>The bank set aside $1.1 billion of provisions for expected credit losses. It said that was due to economic uncertainty, inflation, rising interest rates and \"ongoing developments\" in China's commercial real-estate sector. The higher expected credit losses are a contrast to the third quarter of 2021, when HSBC released nearly $700 million of provisions amid rising profit. It later revised that figure down to about $600 million.</p><p>HSBC executives said they believe the bank will absorb those losses while still meeting its financial targets. \"The overall quality of our loan book remains good,\" said Mr. Stevenson, the outgoing CFO.</p><p>HSBC reported revenue of $11.6 billion in the third quarter, down from $12 billion a year earlier.</p><p>American banks Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reported increases in third-quarter revenue this month, but they have also prepared for tough times ahead. The banks have put hundreds of millions of dollars in reserve to prepare for a rise in customers falling behind on loans if the economy falters.</p><p>HSBC has said that, for now, it is benefiting from interest-rate increases by central banks to curb inflation. Those rate increases enable banks such as HSBC to charge higher rates for consumer and business loans, earning more in interest.</p><p>But HSBC faces several risks. More expensive credit will make it harder for many households and businesses to stay on top of their loans and some will default, which would ultimately eat into HSBC's earnings. A global economic downturn would threaten to sap demand for HSBC's products, such as commercial loans and mortgages.</p><p>Under Mr. Quinn and Chairman Mark Tucker, HSBC is also attempting to head off a push from its largest shareholder, China's Ping An Insurance, to potentially split off the company's Asian operations from its other businesses.</p><p>In the first nine months of 2022, HSBC's Asian units generated 80% of the bank's pretax profit. Growth is slowing in the region, but the hit to major Asia-focused banks like HSBC will be mild, Moody's Investors Service said in a report this month.</p><p>HSBC's Hong Kong-listed shares closed 5.1% lower. They have fallen more than 14% this year.</p><p>Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com and Elaine Yu at elaine.yu@wsj.com</p><p>HSBC Posts Profit Decline, Names Georges Elhedery as Finance Chief</p>",
