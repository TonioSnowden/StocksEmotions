  "text": "<p>UK broker Peel Hunt has struck a deal with Santander to use the Spanish bank's balance sheet to compete with the big “bulge bracket” investment banks for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79beaac7-8944-4289-b96f-968abae3f296\">UK's biggest IPOs</a> and corporate fundraisings.</p> <p>In an unusual European tie-up to be announced on Monday, Santander has agreed to underwrite transactions for the broker, which is fighting to win mandates against much larger international rivals in one of the most active IPO and fundraising markets on record.</p> <p>UK investment groups sometimes struggle to win positions on some of the largest and most lucrative fund raisings because they cannot compete with the underwriting firepower of global investment banks.</p> <p>Under the new agreement, Peel Hunt will be able to offer access to underwriting from Santander to customers looking to raise money, while the Spanish bank will be able to tap into Peel Hunt's client base and contacts to secure positions on IPOs in the UK.</p> <p>Santander's corporate and investment banking division reported revenues of €5.4bn and net profit of €1.8bn last year but, while the business is dominant in the Iberian peninsula and Latin America, it is relatively small in the UK investment banking market.</p> <p>José M Linares, head of Santander CIB, said this was an important step towards its aim of becoming one of the leading corporate and investment banks in Europe.</p> <p>Linares has been working to expand Santander in Europe since he joined from JPMorgan in 2017.&#xa0;</p> <p>The bank held preliminary discussions with Peel Hunt about a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04b5853c-babc-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5\">takeover in 2018</a>. The talks did not progress, but a person close to the bank said the companies had successfully worked together on several deals since, encouraging them to formalise their relationship with Monday's announcement.</p> <p>The partnership will be on a deal-by-deal basis, with both sides able to choose when to use the arrangement. However, those involved said it would be larger fundraising, needing deep pockets of capital, that would be most appropriate.</p> <p>In a statement, the two companies said the deal would provide both with the “scale, expertise and financial firepower to underwrite the UK's largest equity capital markets transactions”.</p> <p>Peel Hunt will bring its research, distribution capabilities and equity markets team, they added, while Santander offered “European strength, global scale and cross-border underwriting capabilities”.</p> <p>Peel Hunt has 157 corporate clients, including 34 in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. It raised £3.6bn in 69 equity capital markets transactions during 2019 and 2020. It recently appointed Evercore to explore options for the future, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79beaac7-8944-4289-b96f-968abae3f296\">including a potential IPO</a>.</p> <p>The agreement includes share offerings, such as primary offerings and placings to support M&amp;A activity or boost corporate balance sheets, as well as secondary offerings, including stake sales by big shareholders.</p> <p>Steven Fine, chief executive of Peel Hunt, said Santander would “enhance our ability to underwrite substantial . . . transactions”.</p> <p>He added: “As our business has grown, so too have our clients and the size and number of high-profile transactions on which we advise, underwrite and execute.”</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas and Nicholas Megaw in London 2021 'Peel Hunt and Santander agree joint venture on corporate fundraising' FT.com 26 April.
