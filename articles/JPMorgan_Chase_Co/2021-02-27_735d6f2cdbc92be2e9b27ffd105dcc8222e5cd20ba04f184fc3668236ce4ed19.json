  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Saving Now Likely Means Spending Later",
  "text": "<p>The Commerce Department on Friday reported that personal income shot up a seasonally adjusted 10% in January from December, buoyed by the latest round of pandemic-relief payments. Spending rose strongly, too, but with a gain of 2.4% from the prior month, not by nearly as much. And with that, the personal saving rate -- or saving as a share of after-tax income -- shot to 20.5% from 13.4%. That marks its highest level since May. The only time the saving rate was higher before the pandemic was during World War II.</p><p>Besides government payments, another driver is the weakness in services spending as people have forgone things like vacations and dining out. Friday's report showed that services spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, was down 5.3% from its year-earlier level.</p><p>This means there is more cash on household balance sheets. Federal Reserve figures show that as of the end of the third quarter households had $2.2 trillion more in cash and cash equivalents than at the end of 2019. That amount is undoubtedly higher now and, with another round of government relief in the works, could go higher still.</p><p>Of course it is wealthier households that have accrued the most. But the less wealthy appear to be amassing savings, too. An analysis of 1.8 million family checking accounts conducted by economists at the JPMorgan Chase Institute shows that as of the end of October the median balance was up by about 40% from a year earlier. And median balances for families in the lowest quarter of the income distribution were up by about 45%.</p><p>While many are still in tough financial straits, especially those once employed in service-sector jobs, many poorer Americans could boost their spending substantially once the crisis eases. As they likely have more needs that aren't already met, they have a much higher propensity to consume.</p><p>The toll that the past year has exacted on poorer Americans is enormous, but that hardly means they will feel any less relief if the pandemic starts to fade.</p>",
