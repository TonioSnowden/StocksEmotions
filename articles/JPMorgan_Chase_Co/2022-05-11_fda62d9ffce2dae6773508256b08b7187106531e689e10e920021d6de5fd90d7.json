  "text": "<p>Citigroup Inc. has named Tom Anderson as its new chief compliance officer.</p><p>Mr. Anderson, who currently serves as compliance chief of Citi's personal banking and wealth management business, will begin his new role on June 1, according to an internal memo from Citigroup General Counsel Brent McIntosh seen by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Mr. Anderson \"played a key role in moving Citi's compliance risk program forward,\" Mr. McIntosh said.</p><p>Mr. Anderson rejoined Citi last summer following a seven-year stint at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., where he was head of compliance for consumer and community banking at JPMorgan Chase Bank.</p><p>Before that, Mr. Anderson worked as chief executive of American Express Global Banking for about five years, serving as a liaison to U.S. and international regulators. He began his career at Citi as a management trainee, then moved up the ranks over 20 years, according to his profile on the professional networking site LinkedIn.</p><p>Citigroup said outgoing Compliance Chief Mary McNiff will aid Mr. Anderson in the transition. Ms. McNiff assumed that role in June 2020 after serving as chief executive of Citibank, which accounts for about 75% of Citigroup's assets.</p><p>Her move into the compliance role came a few months ahead of a $400 million settlement between Citigroup and U.S. banking regulators, who cited \"significant ongoing deficiencies\" in the bank's risk management systems.</p><p>At the time, the Federal Reserve said Citigroup hadn't adequately remediated \"longstanding enterprise-wide risk management and controls deficiencies.\"</p><p>As part of that settlement, the bank's board agreed to make a plan that would see senior management improve its risk management practices. The board also agreed to give Citigroup's general counsel overall responsibility for the compliance function at the bank and its subsidiaries.</p><p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in a separate settlement order cited the bank's \"longstanding failure\" to fix problems in its risk systems as the basis for a fine.</p><p>Citigroup said at the time that it had engaged in significant remediation projects.</p><p>Write to Richard Vanderford at richard.vanderford@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup Names New Compliance Chief</p>",
