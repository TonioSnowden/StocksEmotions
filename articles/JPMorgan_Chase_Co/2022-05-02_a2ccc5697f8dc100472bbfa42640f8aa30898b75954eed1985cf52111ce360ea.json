  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: thousands of people descended on the Nebraskan city of Omaha at the weekend for <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>'s annual meeting. It was the first time shareholders had heard in person from the group's billionaire founder <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> since the pandemic. Read all about it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/049d1084-f2eb-439b-b01e-575ef0dea525\">here</a></p> <h1>China's two contradictory directions for investors</h1> <p>China's appetite for global finance seems increasingly to be pulling in two contradictory directions, reports my colleague <em>Tabby Kinder</em> in Hong Kong. On one hand, policy reforms over the past five years have provided unprecedented access for global firms. Just last month, China said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06a8e069-20c7-44be-bc55-bd8774aff3af\">it will launch</a> an official private pension scheme that aims to push more of the country's vast household savings into the financial market.</p> <p>International investors like <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>JPMorgan</strong> and <strong>Amundi</strong> have all been expanding their presence in China in the past couple of years. Now they are positioning to grab a piece of a potentially huge new business, as we report in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfdfb0bc-3624-49e9-8c4e-5f3b16032918\">this analysis</a>.</p> <p>China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0463c70d-4d24-4b9b-b7e5-ace22409d8e2\">recent capitulation</a> to the US over access to audit files on Chinese companies suggests Beijing is open to further foreign investment and better international co-operation on finance. China wants Shanghai to be an international financial centre with “major global influence” by 2035. Things appear to be moving in the right direction.</p> <p>But on the other hand, Beijing has spent a year interfering in markets and issuing a series of regulatory edicts to corporate China so severe that trillions of dollars have been knocked off its largest companies. JPMorgan last month called China's internet sector, once an engine of growth, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cda606f-aa6a-444a-8331-310c6b5f167d\">“uninvestable”</a>. Many big investors have headed for the exits. This week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bf52409-fe31-4f57-ae24-f2bd9146a698\">we revealed</a> that <strong>Weijian Shan,</strong> the chair of <strong>PAG</strong>, a $50bn fund and one of Asia's biggest investors, has diversified away from China. </p> <p>In a video of a meeting viewed by the Financial Times, in which he likened China to “the US and Europe in 2008,” he said:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“We think the Chinese economy at this moment is in the worst shape in the past 30 years. The market sentiment towards Chinese stocks is also at the lowest point in the past 30 years. I also think popular discontent in China is at the highest point in the past 30 years.”</p> </blockquote> <p>It is a tug of war of priorities that has ultimately led to stasis. The growth of China's economy has slowed. Strict adherence to eliminating Covid-19 means it is virtually impossible to get in. Shanghai has literally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca999419-f017-4269-a715-7424baa18df5\">ground to a halt</a>, with some districts entering their fifth week of a lockdown in which some people have even been locked in their apartment buildings. Any concept of Shanghai as an international finance centre or a destination has been off the cards for more than two years and counting. Chinese stocks have declined steeply. An expected windfall for Hong Kong as mainland China makes it more difficult for its companies to list in the US has not materialised.</p> <p>It is a worst-case scenario for investors that is still darkening. A lot is hinging on whether Beijing will be put into the same lockdown scenario as Shanghai.</p> <p>“China's Covid caseloads have moderated but overall sentiment has worsened further,” says <strong>Ting Lu</strong>, an economist at <strong>Nomura</strong>. “We believe the worst is yet to come.”</p> <p>Meanwhile read Tabby's profile of PAG's Shan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cd2de31-7101-4544-9667-60ed5435da90\">here</a>.</p> <h1>Of funds, fees and fairness</h1> <p><strong>Melvin Capital</strong> performed one of the fastest U-turns in hedge fund history when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77d85908-c17e-4588-ade4-a4d513c4b781\">backtracked</a> on controversial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1a3990b-e262-4bb4-9879-5fc22ed13a38\">plans</a> to start charging clients performance fees again.</p> <p>The New York-based firm, the highest-profile casualty from the <strong>GameStop</strong> frenzy last year, had tried to remove so-called high-water marks — investor protections that ensure clients do not have to pay performance fees before they are made whole again on losses.</p> <p>Within a matter of days, founder <strong>Gabe Plotkin</strong>, a protégé of <strong>Point72 Asset Management </strong>billionaire <strong>Steve Cohen</strong>, had written a grovelling apology, admitting that after some “candid” feedback from investors he had been “tone deaf”.</p> <p>From the ultra fee-conscious Australian pension funds to private wealth managers happy to pay the pass-through costs of the huge multi-manager platforms, hedge fund fees is a topic that never fails to provoke controversy.</p> <p>Plotkin's move was seen by many in the industry as particularly egregious, with the idea that a rich hedge fund manager could effectively plead poverty when it came to paying their traders garnering little sympathy. So what would be a fair structure for both investors and managers?</p> <p>My colleagues <em>Brooke Masters</em> and <em>Laurence Fletcher</em> tackle this tricky topic in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a6eb556-1b06-4a19-bbaf-7bb1e0e97c10\">this analysis</a>, exploring models such as the one espoused by <strong>Peter Kraus</strong>, former CEO of <strong>AllianceBernstein</strong>, who is experimenting with ditching high-water marks in favour of a clawback structure.</p> <p>There are no easy answers, however. <strong>Patrick Ghali</strong>, co-founder of hedge fund advisory firm <strong>Sussex Partners</strong>, said he'd seen structures that were “so complicated that even after spending hours on them we still didn't fully understand what was going to be paid and when”. Don't expect this issue to go away anytime soon.</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>Like vampires, <strong>Freddy Krueger</strong> and goldbugs posting dual axis charts of US M2 overlaid with the S&amp;P 500 on Twitter, the Bloomberg Terminal refuses to die. The hunt for a “Bloomberg Killer” has been ongoing ever since <strong>Mike Bloomberg'</strong>s clunky but crack-addictive terminal first took over the financial data world. It seems no one is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8918acc-c7c5-4cd6-802e-c81d895ab0f1\">getting any closer</a>, writes FT Alphaville editor <em>Robin Wigglesworth</em>. The latest data from <strong>Burton-Taylor</strong> highlights what a wildly profitable and surprisingly resilient behemoth Bloomberg is. In the industry that sells financial data and analysis to banks and investment managers, it remains the orange-tinted champ. Despite a cavalcade of upstarts and industry giants that have attempted to undercut it over the years, the company's market share remains seemingly rock-solid at about a third of the now $35.6bn annual spend on financial data and analytics (up 7.4 per cent from 2020). It has remained at about a third for aeons. Because let's face it, no one ever made a<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2010/09/someone_ordered_a_wedding_cake.html\"> wedding cake</a> in the form of an Eikon terminal.</p> <h1>10 unmissable stories this week</h1> <p>High-growth technology stocks that sparkled in the coronavirus crisis have entered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72a16c35-79a5-4cb1-9ee4-b34fbb4be3d6?edit=true\">bear market territory</a>, hurting investors such as <strong>Ark Invest</strong>, <strong>Tiger Global </strong>and <strong>Baillie Gifford </strong>who have taken part in one of the most lucrative trades of recent years.</p> <p>Inside the UK's race to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65eb9636-d253-42af-8526-50d70c41a19b\">woo the crypto industry</a>. Global investment in the sector topped $30bn in 2021, but critics say the government's plan to attract some of that money lacks detail.</p> <p><strong>HSBC</strong> is under mounting pressure <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63e7df2e-6d22-440d-b540-8c8af902a83a\">to break up</a> after its largest shareholder, Chinese insurer <strong>Ping An</strong>, told the bank to split its Asian and western operations, calling time on a dual focus that has endured for more than a century.</p> <p><strong>Bill Hwang</strong>, founder of collapsed family office <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong>, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acc0158d-77cd-422d-b8be-d3ae64b588a1\">been arrested</a> by US authorities and charged with racketeering, fraud and market manipulation. So how did Wall Street's so-called risk controls <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ece9e7d-a7c3-4276-9d3d-7ac47634f219\">allow it to lend</a> billions of dollars to the alleged fraudster?</p> <p>Should <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>'s <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> be broken up when he steps back? This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89ca1c10-85ac-4d88-8361-ee6b6be1384f\">opinion piece</a> argues that splitting the conglomerate would enable more scrutiny and allay some investors' concerns.</p> <p>People who live in glass houses . . . <strong>Schroders</strong> plans to scrap an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f27f5848-198d-47a7-b933-9608abe538b9\">“anachronistic” ownership structure</a> that has deprived some shareholders of voting rights, as one of the UK's largest asset managers tries to burnish its governance credentials. Here's the Lex column's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b995a8-aac2-471c-8d06-1eb1725111d1\">thoughts</a> on the move.</p> <p><strong>John Foley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37a2b66e-9693-4fb1-a224-efa704bf8972\">is retiring</a> as chief executive of UK savings and investment group <strong>M&amp;G</strong>, which has struggled to find its feet since its demerger from insurer <strong>Prudential</strong> in 2019.</p> <p>Investors in British companies can expect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/108ccde3-c1af-481d-b1d9-eac8d3a5f9d3\">higher dividends</a> this year than previously forecast, as higher oil and commodity prices brighten the outlook for shareholder payouts, according to funds group <strong>Link</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Grayscale Investments</strong>, the world's biggest investment vehicle for cryptocurrencies, is scouring Europe's top financial hubs to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dea87860-db58-4ad1-b628-e431d3e4d74f\">launch expansion</a> beyond its North American base.</p> <p>Billionaire financier <strong>Leon Black</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25552058-8629-4655-818a-a8eb677ceec8\">gave his ex-mistress £2mn</a> for a UK golden visa and introduced her to a lawyer to discuss her application, hoping to facilitate a transatlantic move for the former fashion model.</p> <h1>And finally</h1> <p>Colnaghi London has recently opened a new exhibition devoted to female still life, the highlight of which is a rediscovered still-life by mannerist artist <strong>Fede Galizia</strong> (1578-1630). <a href=\"https://www.colnaghi.com/exhibition/forbidden-fruit-female-still-life\"><em>Forbidden Fruit: Female Still Life</em></a> includes other rare works by <strong>Giovanna Garzoni</strong>, painter to the <strong>Medicis</strong> and one of the first women to practice the art of still life, as well as the only known painting by <strong>Caterina Angela Pierozzi</strong>, protégée of <strong>Grand Duchess Vittoria della Rovere</strong>.
