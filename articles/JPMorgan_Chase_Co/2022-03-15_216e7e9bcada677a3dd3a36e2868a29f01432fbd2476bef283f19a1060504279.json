  "title": "Sarah Bloom Raskin Withdraws as Biden's Pick for Top Fed Banking Regulator; The move comes a day after Sen. Joe Manchin said he couldn't support Ms. Raskin's nomination, citing her views on climate change.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Biden in January nominated Ms. Raskin to be the Federal Reserve's vice chairwoman of banking supervision, which plays a key role supervising the largest U.S. financial firms including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>For weeks, Ms. Raskin's nomination has been stuck in the Senate Banking Committee after Republican lawmakers opposing her refused to attend a crucial committee vote. That deprived Democrats of a quorum needed to advance her to the full Senate along with President Biden's four other Fed picksâ€”including Chairman Jerome Powell, who has been nominated for a second term leading the central bank.</p><p>Her withdrawal could end that impasse.</p><p>Republicans, especially from energy-producing states such as Pennsylvania and Wyoming, are opposed to Ms. Raskin, in part because of her 2020 criticism of the Treasury Department and Fed providing broad-based emergency-lending backstops to assist businesses during the pandemic. She said the backstops should have been designed to avoid lending to highly indebted fossil-fuel companies.</p><p>In his statement, Mr. Manchin, who represents a major coal-producing state, indicated he shared those concerns.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com</p><p>Sarah Bloom Raskin Withdraws as Biden's Pick for Top Fed Banking Regulator</p>",
