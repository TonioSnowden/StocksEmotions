  "title": "Finance & Markets:  Saudi Arabia's PIF Gets $17 Billion Loan From Banks  ----  By Rory Jones",
  "text": "<p>   Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund said it raised a $17 billion, seven-year loan from banks, a fresh injection of cash for a kingdom pouring unprecedented amounts of capital into diversifying its oil-dependent economy. </p><p>   The Public Investment Fund is central to economic reforms launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's 37-year-old de facto ruler, and pledged to invest $40 billion domestically each year to help the Saudi economy become less beholden to oil revenue. </p><p>   The loan, agreed to with 25 financial institutions from the U.S. and elsewhere, is a sign of Wall Street's confidence in the Saudi economy as it benefits from high oil prices. The Saudi government said it won't immediately hand its surplus oil revenues to PIF, and the fund has sought to broaden its sources of funding, most recently issuing debt for the first time. </p><p>   In October, about 400 American executives visited the Saudi capital Riyadh for a conference sponsored by PIF, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and David Solomon, head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p><p>   The new facility will help repay an $11 billion loan arranged in 2018 with 15 financial institutions, and help \"to drive impactful investment in Saudi Arabia and internationally,\" PIF said. </p><p>   PIF's capital-raising strategy is unusual for sovereign funds, which often use national resources to invest and maintain a country's wealth for future generations. Taking on large debts isn't common for sovereign-wealth funds. </p><p>   PIF has reinvented the traditional meaning of a sovereign-wealth fund, industry consultants say. Part of its mission is to remake the Saudi economy, which is reliant on the kingdom's oil export revenue. It combined elements of a private-equity firm and venture-capital investor with a mandate to develop new industries at home to increase the government's non-oil revenues. </p><p>   The fund created dozens of new companies in the kingdom and is building tourism resorts, housing communities, theme parks and entertainment venues. Its latest launch: an international airport in Riyadh that hopes to host 120 million passengers by 2030. </p><p>   The government helped the fund with capital injections and asset transfers, including handing it a piece of oil giant Aramco earlier this year. </p><p>   PIF previously said the fund made a return of 3% annually in the years before 2017, when Prince Mohammed revamped it from a holding company for state assets into a more active profile investor. In its October bond prospectus, the fund said its return rose to 12% since being given a new mandate. </p><p></p>",
