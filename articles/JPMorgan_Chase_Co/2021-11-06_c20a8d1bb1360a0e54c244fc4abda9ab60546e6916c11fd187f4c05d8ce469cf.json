  "title": "Olaplex is a ‘health and beauty unicorn' analysts say as newly public company takes a premium approach to haircare",
  "text": "<p>Truist Securities calls Olaplex OLPX a “health and beauty unicorn” that “appears to be at the infant stages of its growth opportunity” in its initiation note.</p><p>“We believe its unicorn characteristics along with the higher barriers to entry created by the company's 100+ patent portfolio, justify a premium valuation to its high growth consumer peers and to the peer-unicorn stocks,” Truist said.</p><p>Analysts estimate that the global haircare market is worth $77 billion. Many consumers are looking for products to reverse the effects of styling. The company says that about 91% of U.S. women do something every day to damage their hair, like chemical treatments, heat styling and coloring.</p><p>Olaplex's eponymous product line, which consists of shampoos, conditioners, oils and other treatments, are created with “bond-building technology” intended to correct this problem.</p><p>“As consumers increasingly blow dry, color, straighten, curl, and even comb/brush their hair, they tend to damage their hair,” Truist writes.</p><p>See: Allbirds IPO: 5 things to know about the eco-friendly shoe company before it goes public</p><p>Moreover, analysts note that the company has built a viral marketing machine on social media through key influencers: beauticians and stylists.</p><p>Truist rates Olaplex stock a buy with a $35 price target, that's 25% above its current price.</p><p>Olaplex Chief Executive JuE Wong says that customers have treated haircare as part of self-care during the pandemic, showing a willingness to pay a premium for products.</p><p>“People will pay a little more for the results they want,” Wong told MarketWatch soon after shares began trading on Sept. 30.</p><p>The company had the largest launch in its history this year with No.&#xa0;8, which generated $7 million in sales at Olaplex's largest accounts within the first three weeks.</p><p>Olaplex was founded in 2014, and sells items through hair stylists and salons, direct-to-consumer and through retail channels, particularly Sephora where the company says it is a top haircare seller.</p><p>One of the risks the company identifies is that it relies “on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our net sales,” and the loss of one of those customers could be significant.</p><p>Olaplex is also dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers and manufacturers, which is also a risk.</p><p>https://twitter.com/olaplex/status/1452717700308951043“At a high level, we believe Olaplex's proprietary, patented-protected technology has enabled the company to successfully carve out a niche for itself in the broader hair care category (principally, treating and repairing hair at a molecular level),” wrote JPMorgan analysts in its initiation note.</p><p>What's more, as its product line is being increasingly embraced by the professional hairstylist community, the company's medium-term target of 25%+ revenue growth is “achievable (and beatable),” analysts wrote, especially given the opportunities to grow brand awareness, distribution, and enter new geographic markets.</p><p>JPMorgan rates Olaplex stock at overweight with a $32 price target.</p><p>And:A bunch of fitness companies have jumped into the IPO market this year. It's not working out.</p><p>Olaplex says that sales are typically higher later in the year, when customers are purchasing for special events, including holiday parties.</p><p>Olaplex had net income of $39.3 million in 2020, down from $60.9 million in 2019. Sales in 2020 were $282.3 million, up from $148.2 million in 2019. For the first six months of 2021, net income totaled $94.9 million and sales were $270.2 million.</p><p>Specialty retail represented 18% of total 2020 net sales, and direct-to-consumer totaled 27%.</p><p>Olaplex is an emerging growth company, which means it does not have to make the same disclosures required of bigger public companies. A business remains an emerging growth company until it reaches a number of milestones, including annual revenue of more than $1.07 billion.</p><p>As of June&#xa0;30, 2021, Olaplex's debt on its term loan facility was $766.8 million, which, combined with other expenses, could be a risk.</p><p>Once the offering was complete, funds affiliated with Advent International Corp. became the owners of nearly 80% of the company's outstanding common stock, making Olaplex a controlled company.</p><p>Olaplex did not receive proceeds from the public offering and doesn't expect to offer a dividend anytime soon.</p><p>JuE Wong has been CEO of Olaplex since Jan.&#xa0;8, 2020. prior to joining Olaplex, she has held executive positions at other beauty companies including CEO of Moroccanoil Inc. and president of Elizabeth Arden.</p><p>Eric Tiziani&#xa0;has been chief financial officer since June 2021. Tiziani was previously a finance leader at Unilever for more than 21 years.</p><p>“We believe Olaplex is one of the best-in-class consumer ideas as it uniquely combines the qualities of a consumer staples company and a high-growth retail disruptor with a robust financial profile,” wrote Cowen analysts in their initiation note.</p><p>Analysts conducted their own survey among 78 hairstylists and found “high enthusiasm” for the brand.</p><p>See: National Retail Federation forecasts a record holiday shopping season, sales between $843.4 billion and $859 billion</p><p>Cowen rates Olaplex stock at outperform with a $33 price target.</p><p>“Its large, under-penetrated addressable market, high customer loyalty, premium prices and sustainably low cost structure make the model uniquely compelling,” wrote Raymond James analysts.</p><p>Olaplex's price points “leave room for lower-priced alternatives to come in, and several companies have substantially larger salon-focused hair care businesses (e.g. L'Oréal, Wella). However, we think customers are more willing to stay loyal andpay a premium to products that effectively fix a problem,” they wrote.</p><p>Raymond James rates Olaplex stock a strong buy with a $37 price target.</p><p>Olaplex stock started the week at $27.91 after its IPO priced at $21 and the stock jumped 22% in its trading debut in October.</p><p>The Renaissance IPO ETF IPO has gained 6% for the year to date while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 23.3% for the period.</p>",
