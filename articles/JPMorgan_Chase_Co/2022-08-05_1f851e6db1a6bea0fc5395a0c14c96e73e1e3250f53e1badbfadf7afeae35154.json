  "title": "Stocks' Summer Rally Fueled by Drop in Bond Yields; The S&P 500's 13% rebound since June reflects investors' bet that inflation will ease",
  "text": "<p>Major indexes have been racing higher from their June lows, with the S&amp;P 500 surging 13%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 19%.</p><p>\"The bond market is the driver here,\" said Zhiwei Ren, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. \"That's definitely a big boost for the equity market.\"</p><p>Fueling the surge: Bets that inflation, which has been at a 40-year-high, will fall in the future and the Federal Reserve will walk back from its aggressive pace of interest-rate increases. Mr. Ren said he has unwound a position that Treasury prices will fall and yields will rise because he thinks that the Fed will have to slash rates while the economy loses steam, potentially falling into a recession.</p><p>The recent move marks a return to a trend that dominated in recent years, even during the Covid-19 pandemic: Yields stayed relatively low and stocks continued a steady ascent, with investors spotting few other alternatives to park their cash. Tech stocks in particular flourished.</p><p>Volatility in the bond market throughout this week—stemming from comments from Fed speakers—showed that the consensus can quickly turn. Several of these speakers underscored that additional rate increases are necessary to tame inflation, stoking a move higher in yields.</p><p>Sebastien Page, head of global multiasset at T. Rowe Price, said he was bearish on Treasurys for much of the year in the portfolios he oversees and looked to hold less of them than the benchmarks he tracks. The firm's asset-allocation committee has since pared that stance and is considering when to step in to buy stocks.</p><p>Still, he said that the lockstep rally in stocks and bonds \"feels a little bit premature.\"</p><p>Supporting the bond-market rally, asset managers recently increased bullish positions on Treasurys to the highest level since December 2019, according to Deutsche Bank data, though leveraged funds such as hedge funds increased their bearish bets. In mid-June, when the 10-year yield was around its peak, investors were expecting that the federal-funds rate would reach 4% next year. Interest-rate derivatives now show rates reaching between 3.25% and 3.5% by early next year, followed quickly by rate cuts.</p><p>Riskier corners of financial markets have benefited from the shift. Investors piled into junk bonds in late July after six consecutive weeks of outflows, according to Deutsche Bank. The extra premium that investors demand to hold these below investment-grade corporate bonds recently fell to the lowest level since early June, FactSet data show.</p><p>And stock funds tracking companies promising fast growth in the future have attracted record inflows relative to value funds—those tracking stocks that look inexpensive relative to the market—in July, according to research firm Strategas. Investors yanked money from funds tracking commodities and energy funds.</p><p>Earlier this year, many investors had placed a premium on firms that are generating high cash flow now rather than further out in the future. But JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists expect shares of tech and growth companies to outperform other corners of the market in the near term after lagging behind for much of the year, in part because of the drop in yields, according to a recent note to clients.</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped 2.7% this week, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's roughly 0.5% gain.</p><p>Surprising even some investors, the decline in yields has come at the same time that the Fed has ratcheted up the pace of monetary-policy tightening, having raised short-term rates by 0.75 percentage point at both its June and July meetings.</p><p>Motivating the Fed to move more quickly, inflation data has continued to come in hotter than expected. Yet investors' inflation expectations have moved in the opposite direction, driven primarily by signs of slowing economic activity.</p><p>Such expectations can be self-reinforcing. Fears that the developed world is heading quickly into a recession have already helped drive down commodity prices, which analysts expect to show up in the next round of inflation data.</p><p>Although data have been mixed, some investors have also become cautiously optimistic that the pace of wage growth is slowing, reducing their concerns about a wage-price feedback loop.</p><p>That assessment is hardly universal. Many investors, looking at the same wage data, are far more pessimistic, seeing the seeds of stubbornly high inflation even if growth continues to slow.</p><p>Should Treasury yields rise steeply again, it isn't clear that stocks and other riskier assets would react quite as negatively as they did the first time around.</p><p>When yields were rising earlier in the year, investors sold stocks not only because of how high yields were at the time but also because it was unclear how high they would need to go before they started slowing the economy, some investors said.</p><p>Investors at this point have \"greater confidence in the ability of the Fed to contain inflation, [and] greater confidence in the idea that you won't have to go all that high,\" said Tony Crescenzi, a portfolio manager at Pimco and member of the firm's investment committee.</p><p>When the 10-year yield climbed to 3% in the spring, \"it scared the heck out of investors,\" he noted, but \"the next time around, it could take something higher.\"</p><p>Write to Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com and Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks' Summer Rally Fueled by Drop in Bond Yields</p>",
