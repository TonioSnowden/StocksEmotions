  "title": "World News:  Europe Skirts Winter Slump,  But War Hampers Economy  ----  By Tom Fairless and Paul Hannon",
  "text": "<p>   Europe's economy looks set to avoid the severe shock that the region feared amid the energy crisis resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the region's medium-term problems look harder to fix, and leave Europe facing a struggle to retain its industrial core. </p><p>   Russia's war in Ukraine and its economic fallout has shaken Europe's export-oriented business model. Skyrocketing energy prices threaten industries at the heart of the continent's manufacturing system, such as chemicals and metal production. Businesses around Europe are reducing production and starting to redirect investment overseas, including to the U.S., which is luring foreign companies with hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies. </p><p>   Despite the shocks of war and inflation, Europe's economy has shown surprising resilience. Gross domestic product in the euro currency area increased by 1.7% in the first three quarters of this year, compared with just 0.2% growth recorded in the U.S. in the period. That partly reflects a rebound in tourism in Southern Europe this year, helped by the return of big-spending American tourists, as Covid-19 restrictions eased. </p><p>   A period of contraction has likely begun. A survey of purchasing managers by S&amp;P Global has recorded declines in activity in each of the final three months of the year, but the December fall was the smallest. A survey of German businesses also pointed to a rebound in confidence as the year draws to a close, as did a survey of eurozone consumers. </p><p>   \"We can look to the new year with significantly less pessimism than we expected in late summer,\" said Guido Baldi, an economist at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. </p><p>   The war's fallout is reshaping Europe's relationships with its biggest trading partners, the U.S. and China. </p><p>   The U.S. economy is currently growing solidly, at roughly a 3% annualized rate according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Its businesses are hungry for advanced engineering goods and machinery produced in Europe as the country builds entire new energy networks. </p><p>   Meanwhile, China's bumpy exit from Covid, its increasingly authoritarian leadership and its deepening ties with Russia are encouraging some European companies to seek out alternative markets and sources of supply. </p><p>   The European Union's goods exports to the U.S. grew by almost 30% in the first nine months of this year, compared with just 3% growth in exports to China, according to the EU's statistics agency. That helped the U.S. surpass China as the bloc's biggest trading partner for goods. The U.S. is also an increasingly important supplier of raw materials to Europe, notably liquefied natural gas. </p><p>   The eurozone's economy is likely to enter recession this winter, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, but to grow by 0.5% for 2023 as a whole, according to economists at J.P. Morgan. The U.S. economy is expected to grow continuously through the third quarter of next year, and by 1% for 2023 as a whole, driven by household consumption and business investment, according to the forecasts. China's economy is likely to grow by 4.3% next year, J.P. Morgan said. </p><p>   Europe's relative resilience to a historic energy crisis partly reflects government largess. Countries in the euro currency area have budgeted about 600 billion euros, equal to about $637.5 billion, to help households with their energy bills, according to Bruegel, a Brussels-based research institute. Government spending is helping to support growth in the eurozone this year but not in the U.S., according to J.P. Morgan. </p><p>   The government aid will provide only temporary relief, however. Rising borrowing costs are putting pressure on highly indebted European governments such as Italy's to trim deficits and are expected to weigh on business spending and investment too. Eurozone inflation, at 10.1% in November, is eroding the purchasing power of workers. </p><p>   Natural-gas prices in Europe are expected to remain roughly seven times prices in the U.S. through early 2024, and two or three times as high through the end of the decade, according to estimates by the German Council of Economic Experts, which advises the German government. </p><p>   The European Central Bank signaled this month that it will continue to increase its key interest rate, currently set at 2%, for several months to combat inflation that is expected to prove stickier in Europe than the U.S. </p><p></p>",
