  "text": "<p>   Maggie Peloso, a climate lawyer advising several banks belonging to the alliance, said banks had legitimate reasons to be wary of agreeing to Mr. Carney's global agenda because local regulations are simultaneously shifting in countries where these institutions operate. \"It's like trying to build the plane while you are flying it,\" she said. </p><p>   Some resented being chided by one of their own. Evan Siddall, a former colleague at Goldman Sachs and the Bank of Canada, said Mr. Carney can get testy when people don't live up to his expectations. \"He has a hubris and impatience that limits his ability to manage people,\" said Mr. Siddall, now the CEO of Alberta Investment Management Corp., a pension and government fund manager. </p><p>   Mr. Carney said that while he is \"not perfect\" as a manager, he holds people to high standards in public service or in a crisis such as climate change because \"there is very little margin for error.\" </p><p>   Another move that attracted scrutiny was a more lucrative job Mr. Carney started last year. In August 2020, he became a vice chairman at Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which specializes in real-estate, infrastructure and renewable power investments. He now oversees investments designed to help with the transition to clean energy and runs a $7 billion fund chasing \"positive social and environmental outcomes.\" </p><p>   His dual role, as both green investor and an architect of a new global climate finance regime, has opened him up to questions about potential conflict of interest. In his U.N. role, he is pushing banks and investors to stop funding fossil-fuel producers and the like. At Brookfield, he's investing in companies that will benefit from a decline in those industries. Mr. Carney said the criticism of his job at Brookfield \"doesn't make sense\" because the company is a founding member of his alliance and has made the same commitment to reducing investments linked to carbon emissions. </p><p>   He's also been criticized by some environmental groups for making it too easy for financial firms to appear eco-friendly while doing little of substance. \"If there's one advantage of being a central-bank governor for 14 years,\" Mr. Carney said, \"it's that you get used to being criticized on both sides.\" </p><p>   As the Glasgow conference got closer, Mr. Carney increased pressure on the recalcitrant banks. </p><p>   He and his political and industry allies pushed their big shareholders, who are under pressure from their own clients to use their financial firepower to combat climate change. Some major investors -- including Fidelity Investments and Canada's two largest pension funds -- have in recent weeks pressed some holdouts to the U.N. effort about either joining Mr. Carney's alliance or doing more to fight carbon emissions, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   He turned to government officials to twist arms. U.S. banks that hadn't signed on to the U.N. alliance weren't invited to President Biden's climate summit this spring, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Mr. Carney's pressure started to pay off. In September, the U.K. prime minister came to New York and pressed Wall Street executives to do more on climate change. Mr. Carney also has a role as the prime minister's finance adviser for the climate conference. Mr. Johnson, as the host of the Glasgow conference, has tried to become the most environmentally conscious leader of a major economy. </p><p>   A turning point came at a breakfast hosted by Mr. Johnson at a British diplomat's luxury Manhattan condo. As the event broke up, Daniel Pinto, a top executive at JPMorgan, pulled Mr. Carney aside. The bank -- named the world's largest lender to fossil-fuel companies in a report this year from several environmental advocacy groups -- was a high-profile holdout to the U.N. alliance even though it had already announced a pledge to align with the Paris climate agreement and work toward global net-zero emissions by 2050. </p><p>   The bank's position was becoming harder to defend in the face of growing pressure from shareholders and governments. Investors had waged a vote-out campaign in 2020 against a longtime JPMorgan board member, former Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Lee Raymond, who stepped down at the end of that year. And months of internal work had convinced JPMorgan executives that Mr. Carney's goals were both achievable and profitable. The bank was in, Mr. Pinto told Mr. Carney. </p><p>   A JPMorgan spokesman said Mr. Dimon supports Mr. Carney's alliance \"and what it is aiming to achieve.\" </p><p>   The five big Canadian banks -- major sources of fossil-fuel financing, given that country's rich energy reserves and expertise in drilling -- signed up next, along with Wells Fargo. Goldman Sachs was last in among the big U.S. banks. As of Friday, 34 of the world's biggest 50 banks had joined Mr. Carney's alliance. </p><p>   Giant banks from China and India, two of the world's biggest carbon emitters, haven't signed up, and neither have most big banks from Japan and Australia. The Glasgow conference starts Monday and Mr. Carney said he is campaigning to the end. </p><p>   \"We have this massive problem, we have left it very late,\" Mr. Carney said. </p><p></p>",
