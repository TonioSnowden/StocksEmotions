  "text": "<p>A loan deal would provide liquidity and give vendors confidence they can continue to ship goods to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which is fighting to correct missteps from an ill-fated push into private-label brands. The retailer had been seeking about $375 million to pad its cash levels and help pay down existing debt, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.</p><p>The size and structure of the final deal wasn't clear on Tuesday. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond didn't respond to a request for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment.</p><p>The company's shares skyrocketed last week on a burst of interest from individual investors but have been sliding since billionaire activist Ryan Cohen announced his exit from the stock and sold off his 10% stake.</p><p>The company has signaled it has to raise cash. While it has said it should be fine for a year, its business remains in decline. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has said it would provide an update on efforts to strengthen its balance sheet at the end of the month.</p><p>---</p><p>Laura Cooper contributed to this article.</p>",
