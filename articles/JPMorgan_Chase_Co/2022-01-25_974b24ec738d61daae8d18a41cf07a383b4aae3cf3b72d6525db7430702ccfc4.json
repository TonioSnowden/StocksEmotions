  "text": "<p>The moves follow a jarring intraday reversal Monday, when major indexes clawed back losses to post a big comeback. The Dow reversed losses of more than 1000 points for the first time in history. After falling more than 4% in intraday trading, the Nasdaq recorded its biggest reversal since 2008.</p><p>Concerns about the Fed have driven investors out of stocks and stoked worries that the popular trade of buying small dips in the market was growing weaker, potentially removing one source of support for the stock market. Monday's comeback showed that many investors were quick to pounce on beaten-down stocks, though much of that enthusiasm appeared to fade by early Tuesday.</p><p>more on markets</p><p>* What to Watch in the Stock Market Today</p><p>* Junk Loans Shine Amid Market Rout</p><p>* Investors Lose Appetite for Stocks of Unprofitable Companies</p><p>\"My fear is we are going to go lower,\" said Zhiwei Ren, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. It's \"going to be a big week.\"</p><p>Behind the selloff: fears about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates this year and withdrawing the stimulus that propelled markets in recent years. Some investors said they no longer expect the so-called Fed put—or the Fed's tendency to cut rates or hold off on rate increases in response to market turmoil—to stay in place. Others have been more optimistic.</p><p>\"We expect the earnings season to reassure, and in a worst-case scenario could see a return of the 'Fed put,\" wrote JPMorgan strategists in a note to clients on Monday.</p><p>General Electric fell over 6% after reporting a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion, while Raytheon Technologies declined 0.5% after posting quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations.

Meanwhile, earnings have failed to deliver the bumper beats investors became accustomed to last year, while geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine and Russia have weighed on sentiment.</p><p>Around 77% of companies reporting so far have surpassed analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv. That hasn't been enough to lift stocks.

That potentially helped the market record its historic comeback.</p><p>While earnings in 2021 were a source of strength for equity markets, recent results suggest companies are beginning to struggle with inflation and slowing economic growth, said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.</p><p>\"We have gotten so used to this cycle of companies blowing the roof off of earnings expectations, but so far that is not happening,\" he said.</p><p>Meme stocks continued to suffer Tuesday.
