  "title": "What Is the Debt Ceiling and Why Does Congress Need to Address It? Lawmakers are again confronting the nation's borrowing limit, which could rattle markets if the issue isn't resolved soon",
  "text": "<p>Her initial forecast came after Congress raised the debt ceiling in October, following a deal among party leaders to lift the limit by $480 billion. The Senate and House then approved a short-term agreement, averting default for the moment.</p><p>Similar to earlier this year, there are partisan disagreements in Congress over how to address the debt ceiling. Democrats have called for bipartisan action on the issue, while Republicans have said Democrats, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House, should go it alone.</p><p>What is the debt ceiling?</p><p>Congress limits how much money the government can borrow, and once the limit is reached, lawmakers must raise or suspend the ceiling before the Treasury Department can issue more debt.</p><p>Why is this debt-limit fight happening now?</p><p>Congress voted in October to lift the debt ceiling by $480 billion to roughly $29 trillion, a limit the Treasury is now bumping up against.</p><p>The Treasury has been using emergency measures to conserve cash so the government can keep paying its obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients, veterans and others. Those measures have included redeeming certain investments in federal pension programs and suspending new investments in those programs.</p><p>A coming transfer tied to President Biden's recent signing of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill could put strains on how much cash the Treasury has on hand. The law instructs the Treasury to move $118 billion to the Highway Trust Fund, which Ms. Yellen said would happen Dec. 15.</p><p>Ms. Yellen urged lawmakers to take action on the debt limit as soon as possible.</p><p>Does raising the debt ceiling approve new spending?</p><p>No. A vote to raise the debt limit doesn't authorize new spending, but it essentially allows the Treasury to raise money to pay for expenses the government has already authorized. About one-third of federal spending is discretionary, which Congress approves through annual appropriations bills. The rest is automatic spending on programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.</p><p>Although Democrats are aiming to raise revenues to pay for their economic agenda over the next decade, their plans would still add to deficits in the first few years as new spending programs increase before tax increases fully kick in. Those near-term shortfalls could require a bigger debt-limit increase than would otherwise be necessary to cover new spending over the next several years.</p><p>What would happen if the debt limit isn't raised?</p><p>If the government can't borrow to pay bills that come due, it would have to suspend certain pension payments, withhold or cut the pay of soldiers and federal workers, or delay interest payments, which would constitute default. Unless Congress raises the debt ceiling, the Treasury could be forced to cut payments by more than 40%, including to some U.S. households, according to one estimate from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's stripped the U.S. of its triple-A credit rating for the first time after the Treasury came within days of being unable to pay certain benefits. Business groups, current and former Treasury officials and Wall Street firms have raised alarms in recent weeks over the prospect of a government default, which they say would be disastrous for financial markets and the U.S. economy.</p><p>How does the debt ceiling relate to a possible government shutdown?</p><p>The terms refer to separate issues, but both affect the ability of the federal government to function. Hitting the debt ceiling stops the government from issuing new debt to pay its bills and could ultimately lead to default. A partial government shutdown occurs when Congress hasn't appropriated new funds to pay for keeping the government fully open, typically leading to temporary furloughs for some government workers until a new spending bill is passed. In past shutdowns, the government has continued to make its regular payments to debtholders, retirees and others, leaving the impact primarily concentrated on federal workers and contractors.</p><p>In September, Congress extended funding for the federal government through Dec. 3, but it will need to pass another extension soon.</p><p>Could Democrats lift the debt limit on their own?</p><p>Yes, in theory Democrats could lift the debt limit with no Republican votes. They could decide to revise their current budget resolution either to increase the debt limit as a stand-alone bill or fold it into the $2 trillion budget package they are currently negotiating, using a process called reconciliation. That would allow them to move a bill through the 50-50 Senate with just a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes required of most legislation. However, it would be a complicated and potentially very time-consuming process, and it isn't entirely clear it could be completed in time.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How concerned are you about government debt? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The new instructions for the fiscal-year 2022 budget resolution, which has already been approved in both chambers, would have to move through the House as well as the evenly divided Senate Budget Committee, where Republicans could block it by not showing up and denying the panel a quorum. But provided that Republicans show up and the bill gets a tie vote in the Budget Committee, a simple majority of the full Senate could vote to bring it to the floor, with Vice President Kamala Harris providing the tiebreaking vote.</p><p>The Senate would then have to hold a debate and a typically long marathon of amendment votes known as \"vote-a-rama\" on the new, revised budget resolution. Lawmakers would then write the new legislation increasing the debt limit to a specific figure, and that bill would go through the same process.</p><p>Why don't Democrats want to act unilaterally to raise the debt ceiling?</p><p>Democrats say that raising the debt ceiling is a joint responsibility and that putting the burden on only one party politicizes a task that is part of the basic functioning of government. Democrats also say that the debt has increased in part because of policies advanced under Republican presidents, including tax cuts under former President George W. Bush and former President Donald Trump. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats are also hampered by Senate rules that require most legislation to secure a supermajority of 60 votes.</p><p>In addition, the party faces challenges in passing the $2 trillion package of spending on healthcare, child care, education and climate change through reconciliation, and it would prefer to keep separate the question of increasing debt.</p><p>Is this always a big partisan fight?</p><p>Voting to increase the debt limit has become politically difficult for lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, because it is often seen as a vote for more spending that could be used in campaign ads against them. Republicans in recent years have used the debt-limit vote as a pressure point to try to force spending cuts in programs they oppose. The 2011 showdown led to a bipartisan agreement to impose federal spending caps over the next decade, but Democrats have since resisted GOP efforts to tie the debt limit to budget or policy changes.</p><p>In 2019, Congress voted to lift the ceiling with relatively little drama, as part of a broader agreement between then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).</p><p>Write to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com</p><p>What Is the Debt Ceiling and Why Does Congress Need to Address It?</p>",
