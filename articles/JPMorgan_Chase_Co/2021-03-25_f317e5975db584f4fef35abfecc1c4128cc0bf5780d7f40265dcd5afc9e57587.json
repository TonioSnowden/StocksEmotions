The investment bank says the short-term impacts are unclear, noting possible margin income enhancement. Citi points out the investment requires significant initial capex but has potential to generate recurring revenue and cash with relatively low capital intensity. It lifts its target price on the stock by 5.3% to A$13.90 but maintains its sell rating. Shares are halted for a capital raising at A$14.99.

Up for public discussion: climate change. Privately, the council will also discuss hedge fund activities &amp; open-end mutual fund performance during the pandemic. (andrew.ackerman@wsj.com; @amacker)</p><p>1954 GMT - The costs of investing have come down so much that it makes it easier to design a customized portfolio based on your values, Zoe Financial founder Andres Garcia-Amaya says. Even from a decade ago, \"the level of costs associated with trying to create an environmentally-friendly portfolio that was designed just for me [a retail investor] just wasn't there,\" he says. People under the age of 40 are becoming more vocal about investing with purpose, he says. He sees all clients eventually creating a mission statement for their financial advisors. The ubiquity of customization could come in five to 10 years, he says, as we see a generational wealth transfer. (kimberly.chin@wsj.com; @mskimberlychin)</p><p>1947 GMT - The Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act--a cannabis bill in Congress that aims to open up banking services for marijuana companies--would make the marijuana industry more normalized and less underground, Scott Greiper, founder of Viridian Capital Advisors, says on a forum about cannabis hosted by the law firm Dentons. The bill would further entrench among large buy-side investors the perception that the industry is getting interesting. Viridian recently said it tracked 58 cannabis-related deals in the first 11 weeks of the year, \"higher than the comparable period in any year except 2019.\"(micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)</p><p>1936 GMT - Andres Garcia-Amaya, a former JPMorgan executive who founded and leads Zoe Financial, says the technology is nearly there to allow investors to create personalized portfolios, reflecting interests and values while screening out investments that go against those values. \"It's not only for someone that has $50 million who can create that level of granularity,\" he tells WSJ, \"but it's that 30-something that, by the way, in a couple years will be 40-something and then 50-something and will have all the wealth.\" Garcia-Amaya, whose fintech startup connects people with financial advisers, says that while personal indexing is still years away, the momentum is there and will likely become the norm. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)</p><p>1846 GMT - The tug of war between the financial-advice industry and asset-managers like Vanguard that specialize in lower-fee, passive investments has been going on for years. But Andres Garcia-Amaya, co-founder of wealth manager Zoe Financial, says the rise of Vanguard doesn't mean financial advice tailored to client needs and issues is no longer relevant. By lowering costs for investments, Vanguard helped widen the pool of people needing advice beyond the wealthiest, he tells WSJ reporters. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)</p><p>1817 GMT - Energy has been the stock market's best-performing sector this year, and after a two-week rough patch energy shares are once again back in business as they follow soaring crude-oil prices higher. The XOP oil and gas exploration and production ETF is up 4%, shale firm Devon climbs 6% and oilfield services giant Halliburton rises 4%. WTI crude prices hit a six-week-low yesterday but are more than 5% higher today--their best day since November--as many investors sensed a seemingly perfect, buy-the-dip opportunity. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</p><p>1640 GMT - Moody's changed its outlook on the US banking system to stable from negative to reflect the sector's improving operating environment and significant buildup of reserves. The ratings firm says the reserves are more than sufficient to absorb expected pandemic-related net charge-offs. Accelerating economic recovery and stabilization of asset risk will also help ease the pressure on profitability. \"We expect US banks to maintain solid buffers against stress losses, even as shareholder distributions resume, and to maintain strong funding and liquidity,\" the firm says. The previous negative outlook had been in place since March 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. (michael.dabaie@wsj.com)</p><p>1609 GMT - QQQ, the giant tech-focused ETF run by investment manager Invesco Ltd., has in recent months grabbed the attention of a new generation of retail investors. Shares have surged 90% over the past year, and assets in the fund have soared to a recent $150B, making it one of the largest ETFs anywhere. In the run-up to the 2000 dot-com bubble, Dave Nadig , director of research at ETF Trends, saw tons of enthusiasm for QQQ, making it one of the \"it\" buys of the time. \"For a long time in the run-up, the default was you hit 'buy' on the Q's pre-market,\" he said. \"Back then, it was a pretty darn good proxy for what was going on in the Internet and investing craze of the moment.\" QQQ spent more than $66M on marketing in 2020. \"The category has historically been dull, but the Q's give us permission,\" said Emily Pachuta, chief marketing and analytics officer at Invesco. \"This is an investor who likes the product because of access to innovation,\" she said of the target audience. (julia.carpenter@wsj.com)</p><p>1452 GMT - Environmental, social and governance exchange-traded funds aren't as supportive of environmental and social shareholder proposals as passive and active ESG funds are, Morgan Stanley analysts say, citing data from Proxy Insight. Between 2017 and 2020, the analysts say that ESG ETFs supported 51% of environmental and social resolutions, compared with 59% among passive ESG funds and 63% among active ESG funds. Meanwhile, non-ESG ETFs were against 93% of the proposals. (dieter.holger@wsj.com; @dieterholger)</p><p>1348 GMT - NatWest Group 's planned exit from the Republic of Ireland offers expansion opportunities for the country's local banks, says Deutsche Bank . Ireland's banking sector remains in flux despite nearly a decade elapsing since the Irish real-estate crisis, the German bank says. \"Natwest's announced exit from Ireland offers opportunities for local banks to acquire high-quality assets and to quickly expand in a country where credit growth has been lacking for the last decade,\" says analyst Robert Noble. Local rivals include AIB and Bank of Ireland . Meanwhile, Deutsche raises its rating on NatWest to hold from sell with an unchanged 170 pence price target. Shares rise 0.3% to 196 pence.
