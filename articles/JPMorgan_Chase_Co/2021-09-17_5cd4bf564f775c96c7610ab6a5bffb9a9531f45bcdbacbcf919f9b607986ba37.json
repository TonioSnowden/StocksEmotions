  "title": "Energy Price Crunch Pushes Investors in Europe to Bet on Inflation; Short-term market gauges of inflation expectations signal consumer prices to keep climbing",
  "text": "<p>The rise in investors' fears about inflation in recent weeks is in contrast to the U.S. where a similar gauge has been relatively stable. Inflation in the U.S. has also risen but a data release on Wednesday showed that consumer price rises have begun to ease slightly.</p><p>This marks a nascent shift in the European Union's long history of persistently low inflation. Consumer prices in the trade bloc rose by an annual rate of 3% in August, the highest level in a decade and above the European Central Bank's 2% target. Investors are split about whether this uptick is temporary or longer-term, with the surge in energy prices adding fuel to the debate.</p><p>\"I don't think inflation is going to end up being a problem in the long run, but it also may not be as temporary as we thought,\" said Jorge Garayo, a fixed-income and inflation strategist at Société Générale.</p><p>Natural-gas prices hit records in Europe in recent days from a combination of greater demand from the pandemic recovery and lower stores of fuel in tanks. Unusually calm and dry weather further boosted demand as wind turbines stopped spinning and hydroelectric reservoirs ran dry. Electricity prices more than doubled in the U.K. in September at their peak and also soared in Germany, France and the Netherlands.</p><p>The spike prompted U.S. fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings Inc. to close two U.K. plants this week.</p><p>\"The rise in energy prices is so bad that consumers are losing purchasing power in Europe,\" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic bank SEB. \"We'll have high prices through the winter and then things are most likely going to start to normalize on the other side. But some elements may be more lasting than others, there are definitely uncertainties.\"</p><p>A doubling of energy prices in Europe plus the U.K. would cost consumers an extra 128 billion euros a year, equivalent to $150.6 billion, according to research by SEB. Energy makes up 9.5% of the basket of goods and services in a key eurozone inflation measure.</p><p>ECB executive board member Isabel Schnabel said earlier this week that eurozone inflation is likely to continue to rise through to the end of the year and then ease—and that the central bank isn't going to move to dampen it.</p><p>\"A premature monetary policy tightening in response to a temporary rise in inflation would choke the recovery,\" she said in a speech on Monday.</p><p>Expectations for longer-term inflation in Europe, as seen in the 10-year German bund break-even rate, have been on the rise but peaked at 1.76% this week. This is still below the ECB's target rate of 2%. The break-even rate is the difference between the yields of an inflation-linked bond and a comparable conventional bond.</p><p>\"You might get near term impulses like energy prices but longer-term inflation expectations still look remarkably low relative to where the central bank would like them to be,\" said Iain Stealey, chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>He sees more value in holding German bunds than U.S. Treasury notes or British gilts, expecting the ECB to keep monetary policy loose in a bid to try to stoke inflation going forward.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Energy Price Crunch Pushes Investors in Europe to Bet on Inflation</p>",
