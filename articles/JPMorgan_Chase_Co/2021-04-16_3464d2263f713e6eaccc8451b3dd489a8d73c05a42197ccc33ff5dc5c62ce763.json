  "text": "<p>Economist Milton Friedman, in his 1970 essay on corporate social responsibility advised: \"It may well be in the long run interest of a corporation that is a major employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities to that community or to improving its government. That may make it easier to attract desirable employees, it may reduce the wage bill or lessen losses from pilferage and sabotage or have other worthwhile effects.\"</p><p>DuPont CEO and Business Roundtable chairman Irving Shapiro echoed the point in 1983 when he told me: \"Most businessmen are sensible and rational people. They recognize that they've got to meet the needs of our society or they're not going to be successful. Free enterprise is a slogan. It means different things to different people. . . . I would make the case that we must get rid of the adversary approach and simply say we have a common objective.\"</p><p>Ensuring social cohesion in democracy is part of a CEO's job of managing the strategic environment. No CEO wants finger-pointing employees dealing with hostile consumers and communities -- even if \"wedge\" issues are appealing to Republican politicians with a divide-and-conquer plan for staying in office.</p><p>Speaking up is also part of the job. Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan all spoke to issues outside the shop. The 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer found that 92% of employees expect their CEO to speak out on issues of the day. Surveys have found CEOs are among the most trusted voices in society today.</p><p>A Morning Consult survey found that more than 6 in 10 adults would be prouder to work for a company if it gave them time off to vote or advocated for safe and free elections. A new Morning Consult poll we commissioned last week found 73% of adults agree that the government should ensure voters have equitable access to polling locations and drop-boxes. The poll also found that a majority of Democrats and a plurality of Republicans agree that companies should support legislation that increases access to voting and should not support officials who favor limiting voting rights.</p><p>Some 70 black business leaders, including Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault, courageously issued a joint statement condemning Georgia's new restrictions as voter suppression and called on other corporate leaders to join them in protesting these and other, even harsher voter restrictions.</p><p>I admonished the public passivity of Georgia's business leaders. Before the new law's enactment last month, they reassured me that working quietly backstage with Gov. Brian Kemp, they'd purged problematic voter restrictions and allowed for innocuous security provisions. Sadly, however, the actual law was drafted in the dark of night and raced through the Legislature the next morning. The secret 100-page bill was promptly signed into law.</p><p>Among the law's antidemocratic features, it authorizes partisan legislators to dismiss the authority of elected county voting officials and override the elected secretary of state to decide, at will and after an election, whose ballots count. Global watchdogs would disqualify an election held under such rules. Lawmakers in 46 other states are considering bills to limit voting; research by Leadership Now and the Brennan Center indicates that some of them have even worse voter-access problems.</p><p>In 1962, Atlanta's mayor dubbed it \"the city too busy to hate.\" Two years later, when Martin Luther King won the Nobel Peace Prize, Coke's CEO warned Atlanta leaders to honor King on his return or risk the company's relocation. This year, when the CEOs of Coke and Delta followed these footsteps, the state GOP threatened them for their free speech with boycotts and retaliatory tax punishment. Talk about cancel culture!</p><p>Amid such threats last week, I contacted 120 CEOs to meet last weekend for a rapid-response crisis caucus. Ninety of them called in -- from finance to pharmaceuticals, transportation to technology, manufacturing to healthcare, retail to professional services. Despite favoring a range of solutions, their spirit was defiant against politicians trying to muzzle them. They rallied to support one another, especially those with the courage to have stood up first, as well as to fortify their roles in ensuring the harmonious society and functioning democracy that vibrant markets need.</p><p>Civil-rights legend Andrew Young once told me his successes in voting-rights battles between 1954 and 1963 relied on the voluntary support of Southern business in advance of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. \"Believe it or not,\" Mr. Young said, \"I almost have more faith in business than I have in the church, politics or anything else I do. And the reason is there is more freedom and more courage in our free-enterprise system.\"</p><p>American religious history produced four Great Awakenings -- and now American business is sparking a fifth spiritual awakening.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Sonnenfeld is a professor and dean at the Yale School of Management and author of \"Corporate Views of the Public Interest\" (1981) and \"Firing Back: Overcoming Adversity\" (2007).</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Replying to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld on Woke CEOs\" -- WSJ Apr. 21, 2021)</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Sonnenfeld Responds to His Critics, Defends Woke CEOs\" -- WSJ April 26, 2021)</p>",
