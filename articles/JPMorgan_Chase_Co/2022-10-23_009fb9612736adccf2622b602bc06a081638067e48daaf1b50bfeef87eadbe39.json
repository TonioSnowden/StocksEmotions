  "title": "Soaring Yields Press Asia's Junk-Bond Issuers to Seek Funding Elsewhere; Dollar-bond issuance by non-investment-grade companies has plunged this year",
  "text": "<p>The average yield on an ICE BofA index of Asian high-yield dollar bonds is around 19.8%, near its highest in more than a decade. Even excluding bonds of real-estate developers from China, which are mostly distressed, the average junk-bond yield in Asia was around 12% in the middle of October, up from 5.5% at the end of 2021.</p><p>Excluding Chinese property firms, Asian bonds rated single-B were yielding around 16.7%, levels that make it difficult—if not impossible—for many companies to issue new dollar debt.</p><p>That is forcing them to look for other sources of funding. Companies that generate revenues in local currencies also have an uphill battle. The large depreciations in their currencies against the greenback mean they have to come up with more cash than they anticipated to meet coming dollar debt maturities.</p><p>Junk-rated Asian companies have $60 billion of dollar bonds to pay back next year, and another $56 billion falling due in 2024, according to Dealogic data.</p><p>Across Asia excluding Japan, companies without investment-grade ratings sold just $8.2 billion of dollar bonds in the year through Oct. 21, Dealogic data showed. They sold $55.4 billion of bonds throughout 2021.</p><p>Most of the fall in volumes was because of a collapse in issuance from Chinese real-estate developers following a series of offshore bond defaults. But companies in other countries have also been forced to shelve plans for dollar bond sales this year.</p><p>Funds that invest in Asian corporate bonds have experienced significant outflows in 2022. Around $3 billion had been pulled from Asian high-yield bond funds by the end of August, while funds that invest in a mix of investment-grade and high-yield debt suffered $4.7 billion in withdrawals, according to Morningstar.</p><p>\"The market has really ground down to a halt,\" said Sheldon Chan, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price who leads the firm's Asia credit bond strategy. He said that once Chinese property deals are taken out of the equation, the size of redemptions should be manageable for most companies. But finance executives still face some tough choices.</p><p>Despite the depreciation of Asian currencies this year, the best option for many borrowers could be selling debt in their domestic markets, said Shaw Yann Ho, head of J.P. Morgan Asset Management's Asian fixed-income team. She said companies are also considering bank loans and private credit deals as another avenue for dollar funding.</p><p>Local-currency corporate bond volumes are now rising in most countries in Asia, according to data from the Asian Development Bank. The total volume of outstanding domestic bonds in China was 13% higher in the second quarter than it was a year ago, while the local bond market grew 8% in Singapore, 9.5% in Thailand and 4% in Indonesia.</p><p>Most central banks in the region have increased interest rates this year but at a slower pace than the Federal Reserve. \"The price advantage of the U.S. dollar market has faded,\" said Shu Tian, a senior ADB economist.</p><p>Companies are also turning to local banks for funding. India's Vedanta Ltd., a natural-resources company that has previously sold high-yield bonds, raised around $972 million from a rupee-denominated loan earlier this year and struck a deal with a government-run insurer for the equivalent of $500 million. Vedanta Resources Ltd., its parent company, has tapped Indian public-sector banks for financing.</p><p>\"We're seeing a real shift,\" said Owen Gallimore, head of credit analysis for Deutsche Bank's Asia-Pacific flow-trading desk. \"A lot of the high-yield companies we look at are getting cheaper funding in their domestic bond and loan markets. Every week more and more companies are taking this route.\"</p><p>Other companies are raising money directly from nonbank investment firms. Continuum Green Energy Ltd., an Indian wind- and solar-power generator, raised $350 million from a placement to two large institutional investors in July, before adding a further $50 million the following month. Such private deals often require companies to post collateral that can secure the debt.</p><p>India's Adani Group, which took over the country's Mumbai airport in 2021, needed to raise money earlier this year to pay off a bridge loan from banks that originally helped to fund the deal. The airport operator scrapped a planned sale of public high-yield bonds and ended up selling $750 million in secured notes that pay 6.6% annually to funds managed by Apollo Global Management Inc.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How will movements in the junk-bond market affect global economic recovery? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Many funds are looking for private credit deals right now,\" said Matt Michelini, an Apollo partner and head of its Asia-Pacific business. He added that more companies are exploring this fundraising route given the volatility in the capital markets.</p><p>There are still glimmers of hope that Asia's high-yield dollar bond market could absorb more sales. Bankers are still working to bring sub-investment-grade companies to the market, and some investors say they are willing to invest in the right deal—as long as they get rewarded.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say it's full risk-off mode,\" said Andy Suen, head of Asia ex-Japan credit research at PineBridge Investments. \"We do find some high-quality high-yield companies in certain sectors. It's a question of pricing.\"</p><p>—Serena Ng contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Matthew Thomas at matthew.thomas@wsj.com</p><p>Soaring Yields Press Asia's Junk-Bond Issuers to Seek Funding Elsewhere</p>",
