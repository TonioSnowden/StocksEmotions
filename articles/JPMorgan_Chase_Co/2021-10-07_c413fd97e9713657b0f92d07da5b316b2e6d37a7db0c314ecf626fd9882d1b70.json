  "title": "Interim Deal Near On Debt Ceiling --- Democrats are close to accepting GOP offer to defer borrowing-limit fight until December",
  "text": "<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that her department is likely to exhaust its cash-conservation measures by Oct. 18 if Congress doesn't raise the ceiling, saying Wednesday at a White House meeting that the U.S. is \"staring into a catastrophe.\"</p><p>The debt ceiling doesn't authorize new spending but allows the Treasury to raise money to pay for expenses the government has previously authorized. Even so, Republicans have wanted to force Democrats to raise the debt limit without any GOP help, seeking to tie Democrats, at least in voters' eyes, to higher debt levels just as the party pursues programs that would cost in the trillions of dollars.</p><p>Democrats have argued that both parties should be responsible for raising the debt ceiling, noting that increases or suspensions of the limit were bipartisan during the Trump administration.</p><p>\"We are willing to take this offer to stave off fiscal ruin, but we are all beside ourselves that the only thing Republicans are willing to do is prevent disaster for three months and put us right back in this position,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.).</p><p>The potential breakthrough on Capitol Hill came ahead of a planned Senate procedural vote on suspending the debt ceiling through mid-December 2022, which Republicans were expected to block. Democrats abruptly called a recess while they weighed the offer from Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the GOP leader who said the overture was intended to \"protect the American people from a near-term Democrat-created crisis.\"</p><p>Mr. McConnell said late Wednesday that Republicans and Democrats were working on language for the bill. Asked whether he saw a deal being finalized Wednesday night, he said: \"I couldn't predict that.\"</p><p>Democrats have struggled to raise the debt ceiling in the 50-50 Senate because they need 60 votes to advance most legislation. Given that dynamic, Democrats and Republicans had been fighting for weeks over the procedures through which the Senate would enable the increase.</p><p>Rather than allowing Democrats to pass a bill through normal legislation, Republicans insisted Democrats should use a process called reconciliation, which allows legislation to proceed with just a simple majority but requires complicated legislative steps.</p><p>Democrats, who are using reconciliation to pass much of President Biden's legislative agenda, had argued that embracing that procedure for the debt limit as well would be too risky and time-consuming, and said that the easiest path was for Republicans to just step aside. But other factors were at play: Under the rules governing reconciliation, Democrats may also be forced to assign a dollar value to the new debt ceiling level, more directly tying Democrats to higher debt, rather than simply suspending the limit to a future date.</p><p>That fight was shaping up to reassert itself in several months, but the deal allows both sides to regroup. A delay would allow Democrats to focus squarely on their intraparty negotiations over their social policy and climate legislation, as well as a parallel bipartisan infrastructure bill in the House.</p><p>\"We're definitely not using reconciliation for this at this point,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said. \"If we can move it till December, that just gives us more time\" to work on Mr. Biden's agenda.</p><p>\"McConnell caved,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). \"And now we're gonna spend our time doing child care, healthcare, and fighting climate change.\"</p><p>Republicans, for their part, put off an immediate deadline and can continue to try to force Democrats to use reconciliation, saying Democrats could no longer say they lacked enough time.</p><p>The new deadline \"will moot Democrats' excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified Democratic government more than enough time to pass stand-alone debt limit legislation through reconciliation,\" Mr. McConnell said.</p><p>Senate Democrats, who met behind closed doors Wednesday morning with White House officials including his chief domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, hadn't settled on a backup plan if they continued to be unable to pick up 10 Republicans to advance most legislation.</p><p>Mr. Biden tried to turn up the heat on Republicans with a meeting Wednesday of business leaders, including those at Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Nasdaq Inc., AARP and the National Association of Realtors, in an attempt to warn against the threat of recession and a downgrading of the U.S. credit rating.</p><p>Jane Fraser, chief executive of Citigroup Inc., described the situation as \"playing with fire.\" She said a default would cause lasting reputational damage to the U.S. and it would hurt consumers and small businesses.</p><p>---</p><p>Alex Leary contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
