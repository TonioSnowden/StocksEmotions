  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Weak Retail Sales Offer a Preview as Variant Spreads  ----  By Justin Lahart",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Covid-19 worries weighed on spending in July. August could be worse. </p><p>\n  The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that retail sales -- spending at stores, restaurants and online -- fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.1% last month from June. </p><p>\n  The drop wasn't entirely due to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases brought on by the Delta variant of coronavirus: Spending at online and other nonstore retailers fell 3.1%, for example, but that probably was in part due to Amazon.com's decision to hold Prime Day sale in June instead of July. Sales at car dealers fell 4.3%, which likely reflected vehicle shortages brought on by the global chip shortage. </p><p>\n  But with most categories registering declines, and all the categories that managed to eke out gains -- such as restaurant and bar sales -- growing at lower rates than they did in June, the rise in Covid-19 cases over the course of the month probably put the biggest damper on sales. In the last seven days of July, an average of 84,288 new Covid-19 cases were reported daily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compared with 13,922 in the last seven days of June. </p><p>\n  Worse, the retail sales report might not show the full extent of the spending hit. It doesn't include many services categories, such as airline ticket sales, which credit-card data collected by economists at JPMorgan Chase and at Bank of America show have slowed. </p><p>\n  Nor does the July sales data reflect the full extent of what has occurred. In the first part of month, with the number of new Covid-19 cases still relatively low, worries about the Delta variant were muted. </p><p>\n  Moreover, the situation is now worse than it was just a couple of weeks ago, with new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths all significantly higher. The sharp drop in consumer sentiment reported by the University of Michigan in its preliminary report on consumer attitudes in August shows that Delta has people spooked. </p><p>\n  There are limits to how much outlays are likely to slow. The job market remains strong, and that will keep providing a boost to people's incomes and spending power. Moreover, many Americans still have substantially more money in the bank now than they did before the pandemic started, and the monthly child tax-credit payments that started going out last month are increasing those savings. </p><p>\n  But even if the rise of Delta isn't going to make people spend substantially less, it sure as heck isn't going to make them want to spend more. </p><p></p>",
