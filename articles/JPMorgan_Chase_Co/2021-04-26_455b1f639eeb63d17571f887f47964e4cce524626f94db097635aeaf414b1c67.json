  "text": "<p>Discount chain Pepco will float in Warsaw rather than London as it outlined plans to open thousands of new stores across Europe and appointed City grandee Richard Burrows as chair.</p> <p>Andy Bond, the former Asda chief executive who now runs Pepco, said the decision was “definitely not a snub to London” after the disappointing investor reception for the recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4220e2a-153b-489e-abf4-78181e8c123b\">Deliveroo float</a>.</p> <p>“Poland is our home market, it's our biggest market, it's where the business was born,” he said. “I don't think we'll be under investors' radar. Warsaw has had a coming of age over the last couple of years.”</p> <p>The exchange was the venue for October's initial public offering of ecommerce group Allegro, whose shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b70bd767-517c-401d-ad60-4ecde68d9b4a\">rose 60 per cent</a> on the first day of trading. Although they have since fallen back, they are still above their float price and the group remains the largest company on the market.</p> <p>No new money will be raised in the Pepco IPO, which will have a free float upon listing of at least 15 per cent and a likely market value of about €4.5bn.</p> <p> The company's owner, South African conglomerate Steinhoff, is selling part of its stake to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01eca674-bde4-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722\">reduce indebtedness</a> following a financial scandal. It has already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/666bb5d2-0799-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd\">sold Bensons for Beds</a>, another UK retailer, to private equity group Alteri.</p> <p>Steinhoff operates 2,229 stores under the Pepco brand across central and eastern Europe, selling discount fashion to families on tight budgets, and revenue growth driven by a rapid store rollout is the group's sales pitch to investors. </p> <p>Pepco also operates 818 Poundland stores in the UK and 199 of its sister brand Dealz in Spain and Ireland. These are less biased to apparel than Pepco and more towards impulse food and general merchandise.</p> <p>It aims to become Europe's leading discount variety retailer and deliver annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of more than €1bn within five to seven years.</p> <p>For the six months to March 31, total sales grew 4.4 per cent driven by 225 new store openings and the acquisition of Fultons Foods in the UK. Same-store sales were down 2.1 per cent, which the company attributed to disruption caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>“We've demonstrated our ability to grow through Covid and the market is very much in our favour as its effects ripple through the economy, leading people to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/554984ba-c010-4956-9125-6a7fc6806295\">seek more value</a>,” said Bond.</p> <p>“Over the past six months we've opened in Italy and the initial reaction has been very reassuring. We'll be opening our first stores in Spain in the next couple of weeks,” he added.</p> <p>The group believes it could open another 8,000 stores across the whole of Europe, but Bond said that given the small catchment of each shop he had few concerns about saturation.</p> <p>“We think we have got 20 or 30 years of openings at the current rate before we have to worry about cannibalising our own sales.” He pointed out that in the similarly-sized US market, Dollar General has more than 17,000 stores.</p> <p>Like many other discounters, Pepco does not sell online, citing the poor economics of ecommerce with low price points and small average basket sizes.</p> <p>Burrows, who has chaired British American Tobacco since 2009 and was governor of Bank of Ireland at the time of the global financial crisis, will become chair when the company lists. </p> <p>A full prospectus will be published in May and about 5 per cent of the shares will be offered to Polish retail investors. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are acting as joint global co-ordinators.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Pepco sets out store in Europe' FT.com 26 April.
