  "title": "Eargo stock plummets to record low as the former hot IPO is now a target of a DOJ criminal probe",
  "text": "<p>The news led J.P. Morgan, which was one of the lead underwriters of Eargo's initial public offering last year, to reverse course and recommend investors sell.</p><p>The stock EAR plummeted 67.3% in active afternoon trading, enough to easily make it the biggest decliner on major U.S. exchanges, and putting it on track for a record low close. Trading volume spiked to 46.5 million shares, which compares with the full-day average over the past 30 days of about 762,000 shares, according to FactSet.</p><p>Eargo said in an 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday that on Sept. 21, the company was informed of a criminal investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice, related to insurance reimbursement claims the company submitted on behalf of its customers covered by federal employee health plans.</p><p>“The company is cooperating with the investigation,” Eargo said in the 8-K. “In addition, the company intends to work with the government with the objective of validating the process to support any future claims that the company may submit for reimbursement.”</p><p>In the company's 10-Q filed last month, the company had disclosed that it has been the subject of a “claims audit” by its largest third-party payer, which accounted for 80% of gross accounts receivable as the end of June. Due to the audit, the company had not been paid on claims submitted since March 31.</p><p>J.P. Morgan's Robert Marcus double downgraded Eargo to underweight, after being at overweight since initiating coverage in November 2020, about a month after the company went public. Marcus slashed his stock price target to $11 from $44.</p><p>“While we were already aware of the continuing claims audit being conducted by the company's largest third-party payer, the involvement of the federal government adds an additional element of uncertainty that makes it very difficult to confidently forecast the company's insurance revenues,” Marcus wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>He noted for context, that federal insurance revenue represented approximately 50% of sales, and was a greater percentage of incremental growth going forward.</p><p>What a difference 11 months makes for Eargo. The company went public on Oct. 16, 2020, after it's upsized IPO priced at $18 a share, well above the expected range of between $14 and $16 a share. The company sold 7.85 million shares in the IPO to raise $141.3 million, more than the previously expected offering of 6.67 million shares.</p><p>FactSet, MarketWatchAnd with 35.14 million shares outstanding after the IPO, the pricing valued the company at about $614.6 million. J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities acted as the lead book-running managers.</p><p>The stock closed its first day of trading at $33.68, or 87.1% above its IPO price. Four months later, it had closed as high as $75.37 on Feb. 10, or more than four times its IPO price. At that price, the company was valued at about $2.9 billion.</p><p>Since then, as company had revealed wider-than-expected losses in two of its three quarterly reports, the stock had plunged 71.2% through Wednesday. Over the same time, the Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund IPO had lost 8.8% and the S&amp;P 500 index SPX had gained 12.4%.</p><p>Add in Thursday's losses, and the stock was down 90.6% from its record close, and is trading 60.7% below its IPO price. The market cap has sunk to about $277.3 million.</p><p>And now J.P. Morgan's Marcus sees risk of even further losses, given that such a large portion of future revenue is tied to a “highly unpredictable and hart to diligence binary event.”</p><p>He said the company has enough cash on hand to sustain business for two to three years. However, “we believe a resolution in the short to midterm is unlikely and will likely force the company to restructure and better appropriately size spending.”</p>",
