  "text": "<p>The European Central Bank has warned lenders with significant exposure to Russia to ready themselves for the imposition of international sanctions against the country if Moscow invades Ukraine.</p> <p>The warning from the ECB, which supervises 115 of the biggest eurozone banks, came as the US warned that Russia would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/475d6954-ea9b-4ad4-a884-a4afb38cfc14\">face “massive consequences”</a> if sent troops into Ukraine.</p> <p>Sanctions would raise considerable risks for the international banks with large Russian exposure including Citi in the US, France's Société Générale, Austria's Raiffeisen and Italy's UniCredit.</p> <p>ECB officials have asked for details of how the banks would handle different scenarios, such as a move to block Russian banks from accessing the Swift international payments system, according to several people briefed on the talks.</p> <p>The requests underlined how the ECB wants to ensure that European banks are able to comply with any sanctions regime and quickly cut out clients with whom they are banned from doing business.</p> <p>The central bank has explored the risks of various possibilities and pressed the banks to share details of their own assessments and contingency plans, according to people briefed on the discussions.</p> <p>It has also requested information on Russian and Ukrainian exposure from Deutsche Bank and ING, the biggest lenders in Germany and the Netherlands, respectively. Citi, Deutsche Bank, SocGen, Raiffeisen and ING declined to comment, as did the ECB. UniCredit could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>International banks, including their Russian subsidiaries, have about $121bn in assets owed to them by Russian-based entities, and there is $128bn in loan and deposit funding from Russian entities to foreign banks, according to the Bank for International Settlements.</p> <p>SocGen has the biggest financial exposure to Russia of any European bank, with €2.6bn, according to research from JPMorgan. Austria's Raiffeisen has €1.9bn of exposure, while UniCredit has €1.4bn.</p> <p>Andrea Orcel, chief executive of UniCredit, was among the top executives from large Italian companies who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da18b7ef-467a-415e-ae3e-07afaf812543\">joined a video meeting</a> with Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss economic ties.</p> <p>A senior executive at one of the banks said the main risk from sanctions was for its Russian investment banking operations, which deal with big multinational companies and oligarchs, rather than to its commercial banking unit, which mostly deals with midsized companies.</p> <p>The executive said the biggest “systemic risk” would be if Russia was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2eaba73-cec8-4a0f-b991-7de558bb0ee1\">cut off from the Swift payments network</a>, which could “have an impact on the whole banking system in Russia”. However, the executive said the Russian central bank planned to activate a domestic interbank payment system to replace Swift, if needed.</p> <p>An additional risk for the European banks was that conflict in Ukraine could hit the value of the rouble, reducing the value of equity held in their Russian subsidiaries.</p> <p>Another European bank executive said there was a concern about the risk of going to jail in Russia if Moscow retaliated against banks that tried to implement international sanctions. “We need to be able to implement sanctions very fast . . . sometimes it takes time, you may have relationships to wind down,” the executive said.</p> <p>Michael Lyons, partner at law firm Clifford Chance, said sanctions could affect a broad group of banks operating in Russia. “Customers of retail banks are not just regular individuals, but also corporates, and private [business] entities. Some may have sizeable private wealth management divisions.”</p><p>Source: Martin Arnold in Frankfurt and Laura Noonan, Owen Walker and Stephen Morris in London 2022 'ECB warns European lenders on Russia sanctions risk' FT.com 26 January.
