As in the UK, the Federal Reserve and the White House have both been at pains to stress that current&#xa0;inflationary pressures were temporary and are likely to fade as lockdowns ease and supply catches up with pent-up demand.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>US prices are being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aadaa577-b286-443f-b173-256dfc4af6a5\">driven higher by a number of factors</a>, including energy costs; airfare and hotel charges; rents; and services such as restaurants which are springing back to life as pandemic restrictions are loosened. A notable common factor for the UK and the US — where they were responsible for a third of June's CPI increase — is prices for used cars, which have soared as the global semiconductor shortage hits the supply of new models.&#xa0;</p> <p>The new figures add to pressure on Fed chief Jay Powell to justify the bank's stance at his appearance in Congress today, with some arguing that the central bank should begin tapering its pandemic support measures as early as September. Opposition Republicans say the government's $1.9tn economic stimulus has fuelled the rise in prices. </p> <p>In prepared remarks ahead of his appearance, Powell reiterated that the central bank stood <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37d57052-c2a5-4a44-8b27-9d205a2a1c50\">ready to intervene</a> should inflationary pressures begin to spiral higher but that the threshold to altering its debt purchase programme was “a ways off”.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/784d4146-7504-413b-962a-038eb9ef6bdf\">financial markets</a>, the UK data led to a fall in the prices of British government bonds, known as gilts, and traders betting that increases in interest rates could come sooner than expected, while Powell's remarks led to US stocks opening higher and Treasury bonds rallying.</p> <p>Inflationary pressures are not confined to the US and the UK. We also report today on the increasing pressure on the government and central bank in India, where rises in prices of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de840a18-cb5e-45e7-ad4e-981b8aee2d58\">essentials such as milk and gas for cooking</a> are compounding the economic shock from the pandemic.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>The <strong>G20</strong>, which contains 63 per cent of the world's people and 87 per cent of its output, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9448d15-8410-47d3-8f41-cd7ed41d8116\">failed to meet the key global challenges</a> of escaping from the pandemic and climate change, says chief economics commentator Martin Wolf. It has been unable to resolve the shortfall in funding for Covid-19 treatments and vaccines, making the chances of tackling the even greater threat of global warming even more remote, he argues.</p> <p><strong>China</strong> will publish second-quarter GDP figures tomorrow with investors anxious to see any signs that economic recovery might be faltering. Here are<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/419f57a6-719b-478a-815d-ef232171c8cf\"> five things to watch.</a></p> <p>The <strong>Tokyo Olympics</strong> was meant to be an expression of a renewed and self-confident Japan after years of economic stagnation, but as our Big Read on Tokyo 2020 explains, they have become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75f2b380-1d04-4a5a-981a-9ef033fe409e\">a matter of survival</a>. The city is living with a Covid-19 state of emergency, foreign spectators will be absent, and more than half the public wants the games cancelled or postponed.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan</strong> kicked off US earnings season by reporting second-quarter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73999cf3-82ed-453d-a30c-e88e55cc8813\">surges in fees from deals</a> and initial public offerings. Earnings at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94e26c0f-4fd3-4d31-a624-8e6ec35ce0ae\">JPMorgan</a>, the largest US bank, rose to $3.78 per share from $1.38 last year, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ded77c47-ce4b-4a33-89c1-2e4ea18cf094\">Goldman's</a> rose from $0.53 to&#xa0;$15.02. <strong>Bank of America</strong>, the second-largest US lender, reported a steeper than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20e2a584-9685-4aca-bac8-78c23e828400\">fall in revenues</a> as loan growth dwindled with EPS rising to $1.03 from 37 cents last year. <strong>Citigroup</strong> also reported falling revenues.</p> <p>The <strong>Bank of England</strong> followed the Fed and the European Central Bank by removing pandemic restrictions on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb4d5ff9-e2a3-48a4-abb5-3b0b5a14a757\">bank dividends and share buybacks</a>. The FT Editorial Board welcomed the move but said the BoE should also have made banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77ffebb6-4d9b-4554-8b3a-65cc38e7b189\">bump up their rainy-day funds</a> (aka “countercyclical buffers”) for another 18 months. Columnist Helen Thomas says bank boards “should heed the same message delivered to those contemplating a return to the sticky floors of UK nightclubs:<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d2d81ce-d246-4f95-9d35-6fc5414cb443\"> tread carefully</a>.”</p> <p><strong>Tui, the UK's largest travel company</strong>, said its workers would only need to be in the office for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ecee317-2c6c-44fa-969e-f23ef89cec16\">one day a month</a>, in the latest sign of how the world of work has been changed by the pandemic. Chief UK business correspondent Daniel Thomas looks at efforts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa5cc7b7-25b1-4015-83f6-1280d2e03ab7\">to maintain Covid-19 safety</a> as the government passes responsibility to companies, which now have to make difficult choices on which coronavirus restrictions to keep and which to scrap. </p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>Investors have become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a848d661-3970-4f9d-97c4-693e2427b7e8\">“much less bullish”</a> on <strong>prospects for global growth</strong> and profits, according to a Bank of America survey, although fund managers were still optimistic about Europe's bounceback. Inflation and the risk of unstable markets when central banks withdraw their pandemic support are money managers' main concerns. </p> <p>The <strong>International Energy Agency</strong> warned that higher oil prices could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/404ae3a1-5077-4d5d-bd06-59f539607c63\">damage the global economic recovery</a>, particularly in poorer countries. Unless the Opec+ group of producers resolved their disagreements over production, the IEA said, “oil markets will tighten significantly as demand rebounds from last year's Covid-induced plunge. The overhang in global oil stocks that built up last year has already been worked off, with OECD industry stocks now well below historical averages.” A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c1a3ee8-2630-48de-b386-976aa9d24040\">deal between UAE and Saudi Arabia</a> appears to be within reach.</p> <p><strong>Cross-border debt</strong> for poorer countries is usually denominated in hard currency, mostly dollars, making them vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates: nine currencies&#xa0;of developing economies fell more than a quarter in 2020 as the pandemic took hold. Sony Kapoor, chief executive of the&#xa0;Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, writes in the FT that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b570cac-a6f7-4908-b68e-47ad0803486c\">global fund is needed</a> to help them cut their risk.</p> <h1>The essentials</h1> <p>London mayor Sadiq Khan and Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected the government's move to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdc5f236-2c27-4146-b6d0-8c489e61530e\">downgrade mask-wearing</a> on public transport to a matter of <strong>personal choice</strong> rather than keeping them mandatory. The Welsh government is taking a similar view. National rail and bus companies however do not plan to insist on face coverings, fearing problems of enforcing the rules without legal backing from central government. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>Victoria Plum</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad1b6f5b-6335-43c3-9470-bba2b92c40da?commentID=03683e68-b8af-49d6-a34c-ffbf0293e2a9\">Benefit cuts focus debate on shape of post-Covid safety net</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I now live and work in Norway. When my start-up went bust after two years, I could quickly enrol online for my benefits, no questions asked at 65 per cent of my former salary. It was not just that they give you a liveable amount; it is the thoughtful and respectful way they have built the welfare system. They seem to want to help you back on your feet and not run some psychological discomfort game on you — which they think will help you find a job. I can see now that the UK clearly signals they do not trust those on unemployment, so they treat them like low-lifes. I appreciate Norway has deep pockets, but I have worked continuously since 23 and paid my NI.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>Spending too much time with your eyes glued to your computer screen while working at home?
