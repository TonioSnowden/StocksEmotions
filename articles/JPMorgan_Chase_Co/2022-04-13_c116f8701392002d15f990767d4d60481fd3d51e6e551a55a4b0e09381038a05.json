  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s pandemic boom ended with a 42% drop in profits and a warning: Rising inflation and the war in Ukraine pose big threats to the U.S. economy.</p><p>Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the economy is strong and growing, citing double-digit growth in card spending, low delinquencies and healthy household and consumer balance sheets. But the bank surprised Wall Street by setting aside $900 million in new funds to prepare for economic turmoil; a year ago, it freed up $5.2 billion it had reserved for potential loan losses in the pandemic's early months.</p><p>Those extra funds could cushion the bank if the economy tips into recession, sending loan defaults higher. Mr. Dimon said that risk remains remote but has grown following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and as inflation has hit its highest level in 40 years.</p><p>\"Those are very powerful forces, and those things are going to collide at one point,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"No one knows what's going to turn out.\"</p><p>A recession, he said, is far from a sure thing. \"Is it possible? Absolutely,\" he said.</p><p>The nation's biggest bank recorded a profit of $8.28 billion in the first quarter, down from $14.3 billion a year ago.</p><p>Revenue fell 5% to $30.72 billion, ahead of analyst expectations for $30.59 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>JPMorgan shares were down 3.2% to $127.40 on Wednesday. The stock has now lost about 20% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 7%.</p><p>Profits are expected to decline across the banking industry. Analysts expect banks in the S&amp;P 500 to report first-quarter earnings of about $27 billion, down 37% from a year ago, according to FactSet.</p><p>Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. report on Thursday, while Bank of America Corp. will go it alone on Monday.</p><p>JPMorgan took total credit charges of $1.5 billion. Of the $900 million set aside for potential future losses, about one-third was tied to Russia, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said. The rest, he said, is to account for the risk that interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve could cause the economy to slow too much, resulting in a recession.</p><p>Consumer spending on credit cards rose 29%, with a 64% increase in spending on travel and entertainment. Consumers started carrying more debt as well, as credit-card loans increased 15%. Though card loans remain below prepandemic levels, the increase potentially signals that some customers have started to burn through stimulus funds that buffered them throughout the pandemic.</p><p>Still, a 15% increase in consumer and small-business deposits indicates that many remain flush with cash.</p><p>Losses on consumer loans were just 0.5% of outstanding loans, and there were fewer loans in 30-day and 90-day delinquencies than a year ago.</p><p>Rising rates and supply-chain snarls dented other areas of JPMorgan's consumer operation, which saw total revenue decline in the quarter. Mortgage originations dropped 37% from a year ago, largely due to soaring interest rates on home loans. Auto-loan originations dropped 25% because of a dearth of available vehicles.</p><p>A sharp decline in the volume of initial public offerings helped push revenue down 7% and profit down 26% in JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your outlook for JPMorgan? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The unit also took $524 million in losses related to the bank's commodities and Russia exposure, including $120 million in trading losses tied to nickel. JPMorgan is a top margin lender to Chinese metals giant Tsingshan Holding Group, whose giant short position on nickel plunged when the price of the metal surged after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p><p>Total investment-banking fees fell 31%. Equity underwriting sank 76% to its worst quarter in six years.</p><p>Trading revenue fell 3% from the year earlier when corporate debt sales, IPOs and an army of individual investors powered a stock-market boom. Fixed-income trading was down 1%, and equities trading fell 7%.</p><p>Markets will get even choppier in the coming months as the Fed moves to tame inflation, Mr. Dimon said. The central bank raised interest rates last month for the first time since 2018, and it is expected to continue to raise rates throughout the year.</p><p>\"I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets,\" he said. \"That could be good or bad for trading, but there's almost no chance it won't happen.\"</p><p>Still, higher rates also make lending more profitable, since they allow banks to charge more on loans. The bank's net interest margin, a measure of what it collects on loans minus what it pays for deposits, rose to 1.67% from 1.63% at the end of December.</p><p>Total loans increased 6%, a welcome sign after two years of sluggish loan growth.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says 'Powerful Forces' Threaten U.S. Economy</p>",
