  "text": "<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Lewis would become the first person of color to lead the federal export credit agency that supports the exports of U.S. goods and services. An announcement related to her nomination is expected later Monday.</p><p>Founded in 1934, the federal agency supports U.S. exports through a range of programs, including guaranteeing loans to foreign buyers, credit insurance and some direct lending to foreign companies.</p><p>Supporters of the bank say it puts U.S. firms on a level playing field with other countries that similarly offer financing for their domestic manufacturers. Ex-Im Bank financing in the past has helped large companies such as Boeing Co. sell planes and General Electric Co. export turbines. It has also aided smaller firms seeking to sell overseas.</p><p>Some Republicans have argued that the bank provides corporate welfare, saying it puts taxpayers at risk of losing money to finance sales that should be left to the private sector. Conservative Republicans tried to quash the bank as unnecessary and successfully constrained its operations for part of the past decade by refusing to approve board members.</p><p>But Congress moved in late 2019 to revive the agency, after then-President Donald Trump changed his position on the agency and backed it as a way to compete with China.</p><p>In the past, the bank's short-handedness meant it lacked a quorum needed to approve financing for deals of more than $10 million. Over nearly four years, approvals to support export deals totaling roughly $40 billion got held up and as much as $20 billion of additional deals may have shifted to countries where companies could obtain export assistance from credit agencies, according to people familiar with the bank's deal pipeline in early 2020.</p><p>In renewing the bank in late 2019, Congress also took steps to ensure the agency would remain fully operational through 2026 even if the Senate again declines to confirm individuals tapped for its board seats. The authorization allows a temporary board to operate should the bank board lack a quorum.</p><p>Before joining the organization, Ms. Lewis was an attorney in private practice and served as special representative for global intergovernmental affairs at the State Department under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Ms. Lewis previously worked as a special assistant for political affairs to President Bill Clinton. Following the Clinton administration, she served as vice president and counselor to the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>She also served in the District of Columbia government in the 1990s as chief of staff to the Department of Public Works. She unsuccessfully ran for D.C. mayor in 2014.</p><p>Write to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com and Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Biden to Nominate Reta Jo Lewis to Lead Export-Import Bank of the United States</p>",
