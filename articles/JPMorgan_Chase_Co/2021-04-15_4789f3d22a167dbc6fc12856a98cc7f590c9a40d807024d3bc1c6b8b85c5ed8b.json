  "text": "<p>The Citi never sleeps? On Thursday, Citigroup announced that it is scaling back what once made it famous — its wall-to-wall global presence on the ground. New chief executive Jane Fraser announced that the US lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ca269fc-f257-4aed-a5c9-03e140a10a54\">would shutter</a> its consumer operation in thirteen markets, including the likes of Australia, India, China and other parts of Asia. </p> <p>She argued the resource commitment was too great given the competition and market opportunity. At the same time, however, Citi said it would “double down” on wealth management. It plans to focus on four “wealth centres” where the global elite congregate: London, UAE, Hong Kong, and Singapore.</p> <p>Since the financial crisis, Citigroup and Bank of America have struggled to shed legacy liabilities and keep pace with JPMorgan which has expertly balanced being a Main Street and Wall Street bank. In recent years, the pair have seemed to made strides. Yet in Citi's case, high profile blunders have stung and investors have remained skittish. It remains a show-me story.</p> <p>In February, Citi announced that it was retroactively reducing its profits from last year by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/998c61d3-7402-4697-bfb0-84b12f305391\">more than $300m</a> because $500m of its own money had mistakenly been sent to lenders of its client, Revlon. The debacle exposed the bank's aged systems and processes and federal regulators hit Citi with a <a href=\"https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2020/nr-occ-2020-132.html\">$400m enforcement action</a> over lax risk management and controls.</p> <p>Like the other big commercial banks, Citi's net interest income slid in the first quarter, though that was balanced by strong investment banking revenue growth and the release of previously accrued loan losses. The big commercial banks are hopeful that a strengthening economy through the year will usher in higher loan growth and higher interest rates.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Citi shares are up 18 per cent so far this year. That is ahead of the S&amp;P 500 but more than 10 percentage points behind Bank of America. BofA also trades at 1.4 times book value while Citigroup is at just 0.8, even as its return on equity is higher.&#xa0;</p> <p>Wealth management has become the bright shiny object in financial services given the high potential fees, relatively low capital costs and the burgeoning pockets of wealth around the world. Citi has termed this reboot as a “strategy refresh” and there will undoubtedly be more shoes to fall. A change in sentiment would lift the valuation multiple, as with BofA and other peers.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
