  "text": "<p>Two of Standard Oil's biggest descendants considered a reunion. The leaders of Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp. discussed merging their companies last year after the coronavirus outbreak put them under financial strain. Such a deal would reshape the oil industry and reunite the two offshoots of John D. Rockefeller's oil monopoly -- which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911. The talks aren't ongoing but could come back in the future. Such a merger could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. Chevron shares added 1.4% Monday.</p><p>ALPHABET INC.</p><p>GOOG +7.4%</p><p>Global ad spending is on the mend, helping Google's parent company reach new heights. Alphabet posted a record $56.9 billion revenue on Tuesday, with its Google search and YouTube units driving performance in the quarter. Ad spending took a hit in early 2020 when people paused travel plans and other purchases in response to the pandemic. Its recovery helped YouTube revenue soar 46% in the quarter. The company said the platform now reaches more users between the ages of 25 and 49 than all cable networks combined. Alphabet shares rose 7.4% Wednesday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN -2%</p><p>Jeff Bezos is stepping back from Amazon. The CEO will hand the day-to-day reins to Amazon's cloud-computing guru Andy Jassy and become executive chairman later this year, the company said Tuesday. Mr. Bezos started Amazon in 1994 as an online bookseller. It now is America's largest online retailer, a cloud-computing giant and a powerful provider of entertainment, groceries and logistics. Amazon shares fell 2% Wednesday.</p><p>MERCK &amp; CO.</p><p>MRK -1.7%</p><p>Mr. Bezos isn't the only chief executive who announced he was relinquishing that title. Merck's Kenneth Frazier will retire as CEO at the end of June and will be succeeded by Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis, the drugmaker said Thursday. Under Mr. Frazier's leadership, Merck became a leader in cancer immunotherapy and faced criticism about how the industry prices its medications. Mr. Frazier also emerged as a leading voice in an industry push to hire more Black employees. Just four CEOs of S&amp;P 500 companies are Black, including Mr. Frazier. Merck shares lost 1.7% Thursday.</p><p>PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC.</p><p>PTON -5.9%</p><p>Peloton is backpedaling on the launch of its new treadmill due to shipping woes. The at-home exercise company said Thursday that it would delay the much-anticipated product release and start shipping its equipment by air in an effort to ease monthslong wait times and delivery cancellations. Peloton's logistics problems stem from surging demand for its pricey stationary bikes -- especially during Covid-19 -- as well as shipping logjams and weather disruptions. It said it expects delivery times to return to normal by the end of June. Peloton shares fell 5.9% Friday.</p><p>FORD MOTOR CO.</p><p>F +1.2%</p><p>Auto makers are slashing production thanks to a global semiconductor shortfall. Ford said Thursday it plans to cut production of its F-150 pickup truck -- the nation's top-selling vehicle and the company's biggest moneymaker -- because of the shortage. Car makers use semiconductors in everything from engine-control units and transmissions to the large tabletlike displays embedded in the dashboard. Ford executives warned that losses of vehicle production globally in the first two quarters could trim $1 billion to $2.5 billion from its pretax bottom line this year. Ford shares rose 1.2% Friday.</p><p>LVMH MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON</p><p>LVMUY +1.6%</p><p>It's time for Tiffany &amp; Co. workers to go back to the office. A month after acquiring the U.S. jeweler, the French luxury giant LVMH told its New York City employees to return two days a week beginning March 1. Tiffany will join a small list of large New York companies requiring employees to return during the pandemic, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. LVMH's acquisition of Tiffany closed on Jan. 7, after a tumultuous few months in which it tried to back out of the deal. American depositary shares of LVMH added 1.6% Friday.</p>",
