  "text": "<p>Markets have been on edge this week ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data that will shed light on how much work the Federal Reserve has left to do in containing decades-high price rises. U.S. producer-price data are due out Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's crucial consumer-price index release.</p><p>Investors have repeatedly been caught wrong-footed in recent months by the persistence of inflation. In recent months, inflation gauges have shown widespread pricing pressures on categories like food and housing, while energy prices have eased.</p><p>\"Inflation certainly broadened out and entered into areas that were more sticky,\" said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS. \"That's why there's been an increase in expectationsâ€¦that the Fed needs to keep rates at a higher level for longer to get inflation down.\"</p><p>Corporate earnings will also provide insight into how businesses are dealing with price pressures. PepsiCo delivered its quarterly report early Wednesday, and its shares were up 2.7% premarket. The coming days will bring updates from a range of companies including Delta Air Lines and banks like JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Mr. Ganesh said earnings estimates for the remainder of the year and 2023 are too optimistic, posing another risk for stocks in the months ahead.</p><p>\"If you look at market performance so far this year, it's pretty much fully explained by the move in rates and bond yields,\" said Mr. Ganesh. \"Higher rates should mean lower expectations for growth and earnings, and that's not priced into the market yet.\"</p><p>Investors also continue to eye turmoil in U.K. government-bond markets after a historic selloff last month after the government set plans for large, debt-funded tax cuts. The Bank of England's attempt to prevent broader market dysfunction that had hit pension funds particularly hard has had mixed results.</p><p>On Tuesday, BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey confirmed that the central bank plans to wind down its bond-market intervention program by Friday as planned, sparking a selloff in the British pound. The message was reiterated by BOE officials on Wednesday.</p><p>U.K. markets were mixed. The pound rebounded 0.7% to $1.1051 but U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, remained under pressure. The U.K. 10-year gilt yield rose to 4.546% from 4.431% on Tuesday while the yield on a 30-year gilt topped 5%. Yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 and the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 both rose 0.4%.</p><p>Asian stocks were mixed. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite gained 1.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei 225 index was flat. In commodity markets, Brent crude prices rose 0.6% to $94.87, but remain off the highs reached when the OPEC+ group of oil producers agreed last week to slash output.</p><p>Write to Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rebound Ahead of Inflation Data</p>",
