  "text": "<p>The recent volatility in THG shares has left City stockpickers puzzled, with many analysts opting to leave target prices unchanged at levels several times the current stock price.</p> <p>Investors last week wiped another fifth from the group's value after the company issued a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea3565cb-dd5c-445c-b9d7-80ca19bff9ec\">relatively mild warning</a> that foreign exchange rates would have a small negative effect on margins at its two main divisions. The drop came just weeks after an even bigger slide. </p> <p>THG shares now trade at less than half their 500p offer price.</p> <p>A number of bulge-bracket investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and HSBC helped bring the Manchester-based ecommerce group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06b3022b-b891-4642-9048-3ac2683b828c\">to the market</a> in September 2020 and have broadly maintained positive views of the company.</p> <p>Yet target prices vary from the 347p set by Marcus Diebel at JPMorgan to the 900p derived by Catherine O'Neill at Citi. The shares closed on Friday down another 3 per cent at 216p.</p> <p>Simon Bowler at Numis has the lowest target at 230p and is at present the only investment bank analyst with a negative recommendation on the company. Numis was a bookrunner on the initial public offering but is not an adviser to THG. Barclays, Jefferies and Citi are joint house brokers.</p> <p>There is also a wide range of estimates among those not involved in the float, with the 300p set by Charlie Muir-Sands at Exane BNP less than half the 750p target of Wayne Brown at Liberum. </p> <p>Brown said he was “mystified” by the 20 per cent fall in the share price following the update and called an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b88d9d9-1ee4-496c-ba8b-342659401401\">even bigger decline</a> after a capital markets day last month “unjustified”.</p> <p>Many analysts ascribe a valuation to the sales and estimated profits of each of THG's three main business units based on comparisons with publicly listed peers.</p> <p>This is relatively straightforward for Beauty and Nutrition, which are ecommerce operations selling brands such as Espa and Myprotein direct to consumers and for which a wide range of online retailers could serve as reference.</p> <p>However, it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7466fff9-d827-4902-8e9f-4b61a26201a7\">more difficult for Ingenuity</a>, the suite of ecommerce technology products and services that THG is in the process of commercialising. It has reported contract wins but revenues are growing from a small base.</p> <p>Ingenuity has been the focus of investor attention since May, when THG said it had granted funds linked to Japanese investment group SoftBank an option to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d8962cf-6ea9-49c0-8c0f-9abae4afa59a\">buy a 20 per cent stake</a> in the unit at a price that implied an enterprise value of £4.5bn for all of it.</p> <p>Most analysts estimate Ingenuity's likely value as less, partly because of the uncertainty over whether the option will be exercised. At its current share price, THG's entire market capitalisation is £2.7bn, considerably below the implied value of Ingenuity alone.</p> <p>One analyst said that including or omitting the cash that the SoftBank payment will put into Ingenuity if it does trigger the option materially affects the unit's valuation, as does the way that central costs are allocated between the various divisions. </p> <p>THG has disclosed little detail about profits at each of its business units, making this calculation harder. “It's not an easy one to follow,” the analyst said.</p> <p>Bowler's assessment is that Ingenuity is worth just £130m because there is so much uncertainty about its future growth. “Whilst the business has built up some external revenues, we find it hard at this stage to attribute value here,” he said in a recent note.</p> <p>However, O'Neill pointed to potential new client wins, for existing customers to take more services or expand into more geographies, efficiency gains from automation and changes in how Ingenuity services are priced, to justify a £5.4bn valuation.</p> <p>That compares with the £1.97bn value that Diebel puts on Ingenuity and Brown's estimate of £2.6bn, suggesting that the debate on what the group as a whole is worth will only be settled when SoftBank exercises its option or THG discloses more detail about Ingenuity's profitability.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'City stockpickers divided over THG value as share slide continues' FT.com 1 November.
