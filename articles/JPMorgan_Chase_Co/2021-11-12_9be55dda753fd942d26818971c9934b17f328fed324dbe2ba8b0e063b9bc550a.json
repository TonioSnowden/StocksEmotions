  "text": "<p>Good morning. I received a fair amount of emails and comments pushing back on my laid-back response to Thursday's US CPI numbers. Lots of readers think inflation is quickly getting worse not, as I believe, just steady-state bad. I continue to sort through the evidence, and Ethan and I will write a lot more about inflation next week. In the meantime, email us: <a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a> and <a href=\"mailto:Ethan.Wu@ft.com\">ethan.wu@ft.com</a></p> <h2>The China discount, bond edition</h2> <p>Way back on Tuesday, we <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7953a046-c4c2-4377-85b3-44acec1f938b\">wrote</a> about the wild jump in dollar-denominated Chinese junk bonds as property developer Evergrande's repercussions continue to ripple. It has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4dce1e1e-0517-4b96-8c62-65139401af31\">worsened</a> since; yields on the junk index have gone from 26 to 29 per cent (they were under 10 per cent back in June). More developers are missing, or threatening to miss, payments on bonds and wealth management products, as it is all but impossible for them to refinance their debt in the market.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/0c6579b0-6093-4ef4-ab0a-f63bb29d0525.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Dec Mullarkey of SLC Management, a regular Unhedged correspondent, points out that what is happening with investment grade China dollar bonds is almost equally interesting. He sent along this chart, which compares the spread over US bonds on a JPMorgan index of investment grade China bonds with the spread on a broader emerging market bond index:</p> <p>There was once a China premium (a narrower spread) compared to other emerging market debt, and the premium got bigger when the Covid crisis first broke out — a “competence premium” in Dec's words. But the premium narrowed after the IPO of Ant, the fintech giant founded by Jack Ma, was shut down by the Chinese authorities in November of last year. This spring's clampdown on tech companies was enough to flip the premium into a discount, and that discount has widened with the Evergrande crisis.</p> <p>The problems in China are not confined to tech stocks and high-yield bonds. It looks like the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6035da74-dd39-42f2-9501-0140466f40cb\">China discount</a> is becoming pervasive. </p> <h2>Zillow and Opendoor</h2> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d610714-48f8-4b0e-bba6-1056fb431610\">progressively worse</a> pieces of news about Zillow's house-flipping unit emerged in recent weeks — it was selling blocks of homes at a loss; it was pausing all purchases of homes; it was getting out of the business altogether and taking big losses — shares in its rival Opendoor, a pure house flipper, fell in sympathy. Opendoor's shares went from $24 last Thursday to $19 this Wednesday just before it reported earnings — a 20 per cent drop. </p> <p>Would Opendoor report that, like Zillow, it had been left holding bad inventory due to house price volatility?</p> <p>It would not. Its earnings were just fine. Margins were a little lower than in recent quarters, but still solidly positive. Revenue per home sold rose by 11 per cent. What happened to Zillow just did not happen to Opendoor, and Opendoor's stock is back above $22.</p> <p>How to explain the difference? One not-very-informative answer is that Opendoor has always run its business with more room for error than Zillow — wider margins are built into its business. Here is a chart of gross margin at Zillow Offers (the house-flipping unit) and Opendoor:</p> <p>Part of the margin clearly has to do with volumes. Zillow had said that it had one margin goal for house-flipping returns while the business was growing (-2 to +2 per cent) and another for the future, when it was at scale (4-5 per cent). Opendoor's target range is currently 4-6 per cent. Here is the number of homes sold by the two. Opendoor was running at almost double the sales volume:</p> <p>But scale is not a sufficient explanation of the margins, and margins are not a sufficient explanation for why Zillow blew up and Opendoor did not. Of course it could be that Zillow is just no good at buying and selling houses, and Opendoor was good at it. Indeed, something like this has to be true. But before one decides to, say, own shares in Opendoor — its has a market cap of $15bn and trades at about 150 times next year's estimated adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation — one might want to know exactly what being good at flipping houses means.</p> <p>The analysts on Opendoor's earnings call were rather eager to know that, too. It's their job to know. Here was the first question:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Can you touch on housing pricing volatility and how you feel your model is kind of positioned to withstand that and kind of detect it, given the turnover? </p> </blockquote> <p>Carrie Wheeler, the chief financial officer, said: </p> <blockquote>  <p>We're very good at this. This is core to what we do. We have built, over the last seven years, very robust pricing systems. We have seven years of investment in the data, in the modelling and in our team that will allow us to continuously improve how we model and approach home price valuations . . . </p>  <p>We are rigorously back testing our models every day. They're highly responsive. They have fast feedback loops, and we can react to changing market conditions. Our forecasting accuracy was what allowed us to manage the business with a reasonable range of outcomes and deliver margins within that 4 per cent to 6 per cent contribution margin range that we've guided to. Ultimately, the proof of our ability to do that is in our results.</p> </blockquote> <p>We are good at this. We have been at it for a while. We have data. We backtest. And we have positive house-flipping margins (Opendoor is not profitable at the corporate level). This may all be true, but it's not an informative answer. So another analyst has a go:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I think there's a lot of available data [from real estate agents] . . . Is there an angle to how [your] data is structured and deployed that we need to think more about in terms of a competitive moat? </p> </blockquote> <p>Eric Wu, the chief executive, replied: </p> <blockquote>  <p>It's a good question . . . and something that we treat as proprietary and a large competitive moat that compounds as we get to scale over time. And so I would just say that since we started Opendoor, this has been core and foundational to the business and we've invested time, energy and the team, the data pipelines, how we think about feedback loops across multiple vectors of pricing to be in the position we are in today. And so I'm not going to speak to the specifics, but it is a very big investment area for the company.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's not very informative, either. Maybe an informative answer to this sort of question is impossible, even if Opendoor does have really great predictive models. As a reminder, though, here is what median house prices have done over the period Opendoor has been in business (data from the National Association of Realtors):</p> <p>I am still not quite convinced that data analytics can make high volume, high velocity house flipping into a steady business through whole economic cycles. But we're going to find out sooner or later. </p> <h2>One good read</h2> <p>I'm a bit late to this, but here is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa719574-b457-43fd-9c45-ae19a510c1cb\">depressing story</a> from my colleagues Nikou Asgari and James Fontanella-Khan about the amount of fees GE paid to investment bankers as it tried and failed to reinvent itself over the past two decades.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong and Ethan Wu 2021 'The China discount spreads' FT.com 12 November.
