  "text": "<p>Institutional investors are busy protesting against executive pay. In the US, pay packages at public companies have received their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50e73d21-3de5-4196-b124-7281ec7af828\">lowest approval</a> levels since votes became mandatory 10 years ago. In the UK, the average proportion of No votes has reached its highest level in at least seven years.</p> <p>Pay revolts are very much in keeping with the ESG zeitgeist. And disinterested observers can be pleased there is resistance to chief executives earning massive multiples of average wages at a time of global suffering.&#xa0;</p> <p>But investors are not disinterested observers. Their job is to deliver returns, including for those who depend on income for their retirement. Rather than trying to make chief executives poorer they should worry about making their clients richer.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is one thing to fight soft incentive targets or the sort of goalpost shifting that made it easier for General Electric chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afaddd0e-d1b8-4b24-8496-3565b6c0d5a9\">Larry Culp</a> to earn a $47m bonus.</p> <p>But investors are bothering too much about pay at high-performing companies. They are also increasingly complaining about the “quantum”, a word designed to confer scientific precision on a squidgy sentiment: “It feels high!”</p> <p>On this basis, one of the worst offenders on CEO pay in recent times is Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who in 2018 was given an options plan worth up to $56bn.</p> <p>Earning it requires a 12-fold increase in the carmaker's market value over 10 years and increasing profits and revenues by more than 15 times.&#xa0;The fact that Musk is on course to hit these stretching targets — with the market value having risen from $59bn to $565bn — is either testament to his skill or just evidence of a bubble. But if it endures to 2028, sensible investors will not begrudge him his full payout. </p> <p>One of those to endorse the scheme is Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based investment manager, whose own outperformance in recent years has been helped by its bold bet on Tesla.</p> <p>It takes a more liberal approach than many other UK investors, whose resistance to pay awards is generally greater than in the US, even though both pay and returns are much lower.</p> <p>Since he joined AstraZeneca in 2012, Pascal Soriot has re-energised the pharma company, fought off a takeover bid and presided over a 170 per cent increase in its share price. Whether he is paid £50,000 or £50m is of vanishingly little importance compared with the value he has created for shareholders over that time. The FTSE 100 has managed an anaemic 21 per cent rise in the same period. Yet investors, including Aviva and Standard Life Aberdeen, protested against his pay last week.</p> <p>Chief executives tend to care about their pay. That is why banker Andrea Orcel was in court in Madrid this week, arguing that he deserves up to €112m compensation for a withdrawn job offer from Santander.&#xa0;For his part, Soriot thinks he is worth as much as US pharma executives and <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/interview-i-was-right-to-fight-off-pfizer-says-astra-zeneca-boss-pascal-soriot-czx69dmrr\">resents being</a> paid less. Perhaps that is a character flaw. But should he choose to leave the company it will be poorer without him. </p> <p>Smith &amp; Nephew lost a chief executive in 2019 who wanted to be paid on par with his US peers. The UK medical devices company's shares fell 9 per cent on the day Namal Nawana's departure was announced — a £1.4bn plunge that comfortably outstrips any pay demand he might have made. They are still 17 per cent lower.</p> <p>Exclude those who want to be paid in line with peers overseas or at private equity-backed rivals and the talent pool depends on people who are less motivated by money. Philip Jansen, BT chief executive, is independently wealthy thanks to his old job at Worldpay. Jes Staley, Barclays CEO, earns five times less than his old boss Jamie Dimon, but has made plenty of money in his career. It's not ideal to rely on hobbyists, though.</p> <p>Of course there is excessive CEO pay. But it often lies outside the eye-catching numbers or plans. It is those who deliver mediocre performance year in year out with a high-six or low-seven figure package that is just low enough to keep the pitchforks at bay. In other words, people very much like many fund managers themselves.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdb57880-55c7-4d56-b99f-1db9ce9deca6\"><em>Undercut by one boss's delightful candour on pay</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdb57880-55c7-4d56-b99f-1db9ce9deca6\"><em>From Anthony Warwick-Ching, London W13, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Tom Braithwaite 2021 'The hypocritical attack on CEO pay' FT.com 21 May.
