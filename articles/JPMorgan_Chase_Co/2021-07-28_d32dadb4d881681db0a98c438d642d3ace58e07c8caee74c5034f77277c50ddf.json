  "text": "<p>Deutsche Bank has ditched a cost-cutting target central to chief executive Christian Sewing's effort to revive the fortunes of Germany's biggest lender, telling shareholders that the transformation was now “significantly advanced” after reporting its best run of profits in almost a decade.</p> <p>The bank said on Wednesday it was scrapping its cost-cutting target for 2022, a centrepiece of the turnround plan Sewing first unveiled two years ago, and raised its full-year revenue target for this year.</p> <p>The move comes shortly after Deutsche backtracked on a goal of cutting 18,000 jobs, a target set in the summer of 2019 when Sewing unveiled a radical plan to end more than a decade of disappointing earnings and scale back the bank's global ambitions.</p> <p>Until now the bank's senior management has repeatedly argued that costs are the key benchmark to measure the success of the restructuring, because they are the only lever under its control. Sewing's predecessor John Cryan was ousted in 2018 after acknowledging that the bank would miss a crucial cost-cutting target. </p> <p>The decision to abandon the target came as Deutsche delivered better than expected second-quarter results, with net profits hitting €692m, comfortably surpassing analysts' expectations of €372m. The bank claimed it had generated “sustainable profitability” in the first half of the year. </p> <p>The performance was partly driven by the investment bank, which coped better than rivals with a slump in fixed-income trading compared with a year ago, when the onset of the pandemic hit financial markets.</p> <p>Fixed-income trading revenues fell just 11 per cent, beating estimates as well as Wall Street rivals, which suffered an average decline of 43 per cent. Deutsche's provisions for bad loans were more than 50 per cent lower than forecast, echoing the improving economic outlook other lenders have reported.</p> <p>Shares in Deutsche were down 0.7 per cent to €10.54 in trading on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the second-quarter results were “strong across the board”.</p> <p>Deutsche said it “will no longer disclose an absolute cost target” but instead focus on the bank's cost-to-income ratio, which it wants to bring down to 70 per cent from its current level of 80 per cent. Analysts forecast the ratio will hit 76 per cent next year. </p> <p>The bank in December raised its cost-cutting target for 2022 by €300m to €16.7bn. In April, however, it acknowledged that costs would be about €400m higher than planned this year because of higher-than-expected bank levies and other unforeseen headwinds. </p> <p>Chief financial officer James von Moltke on Wednesday reiterated the bank's 2022 target of generating a return on tangible shareholder equity of more than 8 per cent, compared with the 5.5 per cent achieved in the second quarter.</p> <p>The lender's common equity tier one ratio — a core indicator of balance sheet strength — fell 0.5 percentage points in the quarter to 13.2 per cent, but was well above the bank's minimum target of 12.5 per cent. </p> <p>“Deutsche Bank's credit positive restructuring is solidly on track,” said Moody's analyst Michael Rohr.</p> <p>However, the lender also disclosed that it would ramp up spending on its internal controls after it was rebuked by German financial regulator BaFin over poor anti-money laundering functions this year. </p> <p>“The new BaFin order expects us to adopt further internal safeguards and comply with due diligent obligations,” Deutsche said, adding that this would lead to “additional expenses” which it did not quantify. </p><p>Source: Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt 2021 'Deutsche Bank ditches cost-cutting target after bumper quarterly performance ' FT.com 28 July.
