  "title": "Tobacco group PMI wins support of Vectura's board for £1bn takeover",
  "text": "<p>The board of UK inhaler maker Vectura has agreed to support a £1bn takeover bid from cigarette company Philip Morris International after a fierce bidding war, despite concerted lobbying by health groups.</p> <p>Vectura's board on Thursday said PMI's offer was “fair and reasonable” and would give shareholders a higher price than a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab7753be-8bc8-4e0d-b00e-edcae1809b18\">rival bid from the US private equity group Carlyle</a>. </p> <p>The tobacco company plans to “increase research and development investment and to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit”, the board said in a statement, adding that it will now recommend the offer to shareholders. It will need approval of just over 50 per cent to succeed.</p> <p>PMI has said it wants to buy Vectura to expand revenues in its “beyond nicotine” business as it attempts to reduce its reliance on cigarette sales. </p> <p>Its bid sharpens what one top-20 Vectura shareholder this week described as a “dilemma”. </p> <p>“Many of our investors want us to be able to show we're putting ESG up there” alongside financial returns, he said ahead of the board's announcement. “It's a very difficult one.” He said he feared that selling to the tobacco group might enable it to use Vectura as “window dressing” or for “greenwashing”. </p> <p>However, a PMI spokesman hit back at “critics of the transformation of the tobacco industry”. The company “has been very clear about its strategy to leave cigarettes behind”.</p> <p>Smoke-free products now accounted for 28 per cent of PMI's revenues, up from “almost zero” in 2015, he said. </p> <p>PMI has offered 165p per share for Vectura, compared with Carlyle's 155p offer. The buyout group this week appealed to shareholders to back its lower bid, citing the possible impact on “wider stakeholders” of selling the company to a tobacco business. </p> <p>“We are extremely shocked and concerned” by the board's decision to support the PMI bid, said Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation. “It's totally absurd that PMI could make more money from providing treatments to the very people they have made ill in the first place.” </p> <p>A group of 26 health charities, public health experts and doctors wrote to Vectura's board ahead of its decision, saying the company's “future commercial viability as a company dedicated to improving respiratory health would be seriously jeopardised should the PMI takeover proceed”. </p> <p>The letter said the global health community “utterly rejected” the notion that PMI was becoming a wellness company. </p> <p>Axa Investment Managers, TIG Advisers and Berry Street Capital Management, which together own 11.2 per cent of Vectura shares, had made a commitment to back Carlyle unless a rival offered 10 per cent more.</p> <p>Axa signed a “tobacco-free finance pledge” in 2018, saying it would divest from the industry because its products are a “major threat to public health”.</p> <p>PMI did not raise its bid to meet that threshold by a 5pm deadline on Thursday. </p> <p>Carlyle and PMI had been in a bidding war for Vectura for several weeks but the private equity group said this week that it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b860f52-ddf7-447b-bd74-c44b25a69da7\">no longer compete with the cigarette maker on price</a>. </p> <p>JPMorgan and Rothschild &amp; Co advised Vectura. </p><p>Source: Kaye Wiggins in London 2021 'Tobacco group PMI wins support of Vectura's board for £1bn takeover' FT.com 12 August.
