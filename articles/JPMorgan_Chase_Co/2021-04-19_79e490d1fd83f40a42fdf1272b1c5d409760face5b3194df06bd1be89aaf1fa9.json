  "text": "<p>Shareholders in <a href=\"https://www.melroseplc.net/\">Melrose Industries</a> are in line for a substantial payout after the industrial conglomerate agreed to sell its US air conditioning unit for $3.65bn (£2.6bn).&#xa0;</p> <p>The FTSE 100 group said on Monday it would sell 73 per cent of Nortek Air Management to privately owned, Chicago-based Madison Industries in an all-cash deal. </p> <p>Melrose will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its current net debt of about £2.85bn, contribute £100m to the pension fund of its aerospace and car parts unit GKN and provide a payout to shareholders.&#xa0;</p> <p>Melrose said it had yet to decide how much of the proceeds to return to shareholders, but analysts at housebroker JPMorgan Cazenove estimated they could be in line for a payout of about 10p a share or £500m.&#xa0;</p> <p>Simon Peckham, Melrose chief executive, said the sale was further validation of the company's modus operandi, to “buy, improve and sell”. </p> <p>“Making money is not a bad thing . . . Our job is to take underperforming businesses and to make them better,” he said.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The group has in the past generated substantial returns for executives and shareholders through its focus on buying underperforming manufacturing businesses, restructuring them and selling them on.&#xa0;</p> <p>Melrose stripped out central management functions and invested in new products at Nortek to help improve its profitability. </p> <p>It had considered selling the business at the start of 2020, but the sale was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Melrose will retain ownership of Ergotron, a designer of ergonomic products, and Nortek Control, an automation and home security company.</p> <p>The disposal will be Melrose's largest deal since its controversial takeover in 2018 of GKN for £8bn. The £100m injection into GKN's pension will reduce the funding deficit to about £200m.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shares in Melrose were trading 3 per cent lower at 174.02p by the early afternoon. They were trading close to 245p a share before the pandemic struck last year, impacting Melrose's key automotive and aerospace end markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>Peckham on Monday said the group was seeing some recovery in the automotive sector, although progress was being delayed by the global shortage of computer chips. He reiterated that the company did not expect to see any recovery in the aerospace sector this year but predicted that when it did come, “the market will come back sharply”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company is investing heavily in energy efficient solutions, including in new technology that can be used for the storage of hydrogen. Melrose had invested about $75m in Nortek's StatePoint business to help it fund the development of proprietary technology used to stop servers in large data centres from overheating.</p> <p>Peckham said the group would return <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04f77859-2a62-47a9-b5c5-666fbdd77c0d\">to look at acquisitions </a>once the Nortek sale was finalised, adding that aerospace “would be a good place to deploy capital”.&#xa0;</p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer and Harry Dempsey 2021 'Melrose to sell US air conditioning unit to Madison for $3.6bn' FT.com 19 April.
