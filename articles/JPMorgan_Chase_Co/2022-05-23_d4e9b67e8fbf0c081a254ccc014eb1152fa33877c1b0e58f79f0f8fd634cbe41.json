  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase shares enjoyed their best day in more than a year on Monday as the largest US bank by assets signalled that it would earn billions of dollars more than previously expected from its lending business.</p> <p>The updated outlook was delivered during an investor day at its Manhattan headquarters, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/324b1b48-7a73-4c18-8713-aa1eaff5d2e7\">held in response to shareholder concerns</a> about the Wall Street bank's strategic direction and spending plans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e\">JPMorgan</a> raised the outlook for how much its core lending business will earn this year to more than $56bn, from at least $53bn previously, as it anticipates benefits from rising interest rates. By the fourth quarter of 2022, net interest income on annualised basis will be at least $66bn, the bank anticipated.</p> <p>Shares of JPMorgan closed 6.2 per cent higher on the news, outpacing the broader KBW Bank index and marking the stock's biggest one-day gain since November 2020.</p> <p>“We have a very compelling story. You saw that sizzle reel,” chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Jamie_Dimon\">Jamie Dimon</a> told investors, referring to a promotional video played at the start of the event.</p> <p>“I would buy that stock,” he joked.</p> <p>Analysts had expected the lender would lift its NII guidance — the difference between what banks pay on deposits and what they earn from loans and other assets — after the Federal Reserve indicated it would lift rates faster than previously expected to combat high inflation.</p> <p>Given the brighter NII outlook, Dimon said there was a “very good chance” the bank would hit a medium-term target for return on tangible common equity, a crucial measure of profitability, of roughly 17 per cent in 2022 and that it may exceed that target in 2023 “in a benign environment”. The bank had guided in January that it could miss the target this year and next. </p> <p>Higher rates should enable lenders such as JPMorgan to earn more from the loans they make.</p> <p>However, some analysts have expressed concerns that aggressive monetary tightening <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce305e83-fd33-4ed2-9662-8e04764d83a2\">risks pushing the US economy into a recession</a>, an environment in which banks often struggle.</p> <p>Despite the upbeat guidance and what it said was a “strong” US economy, the bank warned investors of the “storm clouds” of high inflation and the war in Ukraine. </p> <p>JPMorgan president Daniel Pinto also cautioned that fees from investment banking would be down about 45 per cent year on year in the second quarter as part of a slowdown in dealmaking. Revenues from trading, however, would pick up some of the slack and should be up 10-15 per cent, Pinto said.</p> <p>Dimon and about a dozen of his top lieutenants spent much of the five-hour investor event providing more details of the benefits the bank expects to gain from around $15bn in new investments budgeted for 2022. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e543adf0-8c62-4a2c-b2d9-01fdb2f595cc\">spending was announced in January and spooked investors</a>. The plans include $6.7bn on technology investments, which far exceed what rival banks have earmarked. </p> <p>“I want to get the modernisation [of the bank's technology] done,” Dimon said. “It's a lot of work.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Eric Platt in New York</em></p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'JPMorgan shares leap after bank raises interest income target' FT.com 23 May.
