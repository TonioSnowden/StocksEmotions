  "title": "Banking & Finance: Fraser Makes Her Pitch to Citi Investors",
  "text": "<p>Investors aren't yet buying it. After several years of underperformance, shares are down more than 5% since she took over on March 1, 2021, lagging behind the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which is up 20%, and the S&amp;P 500, which is up 15%. The stock is trading below its book value, a measure of its net worth, the only big U.S. bank with that distinction.</p><p>Ms. Fraser and her management team acknowledged they have to rebuild credibility with investors and make the strategy easier to understand. They billed their presentations Wednesday as a chance to share their vision of the new Citi and how its global businesses will create higher profit.</p><p>\"Normally I think investor days are overrated,\" said Hunter Doble, a portfolio manager at investor Hotchkis &amp; Wiley. \"This one is a little bit more meaningful.\"</p><p>The pitch won't be easy. While 20 of the 29 analysts following the company rate its stock a \"buy,\" according to FactSet, their forecasts warn of a trying few years and a continued gap between Citi and rivals.</p><p>The last time Citi held an investor day was 2017, and that one left a sour taste for everyone. Then, Citi's management set ambitious targets for profitability and shareholder returns. But the bank proceeded to miss some of those targets, and the stock lagged behind peers. Management became obsessed with hitting the numbers, people familiar with the bank have said.</p><p>In 2019, the bank exceeded its key target, but was headed toward a miss in 2020 when the pandemic rendered the projections worthless.</p><p>The team that presents this week comprises an entirely different set of executives. Investors and analysts want the executives to explain the logic behind their strategic choices and a road map to better returns.</p><p>Investors are focused on three specific forecasts: profitability, costs and shareholder returns.</p><p>The bank's return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability, has trailed competitors' for years. Citi managed 12.1% in 2019, but analysts aren't sure when it will get that high again.</p><p>With asset sales and high expenses for a few years, analysts project the bank will only hit 10% in 2024. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. are both expected to top 17% that year.</p><p>Analysts and investors also want more clarity on total costs. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason has declined to detail the cost of the transformation work, but has said the bank will cut costs elsewhere to keep the total in check.</p><p>Analysts and investors say Citigroup could generate enthusiasm by promising more stock buybacks. In December, the bank surprised the market by pausing buybacks. It was a decision based on capital levels and an accounting-rules change, but Citi was the only bank to announce a pause. It has restarted repurchases.</p>",
