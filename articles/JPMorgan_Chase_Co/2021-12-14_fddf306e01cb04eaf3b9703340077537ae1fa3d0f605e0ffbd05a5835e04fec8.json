  "text": "<p>In Europe, where the economic recovery isn't yet complete and tough new restrictions have been imposed to contain a wave of Covid-19 infections, the arrival of Omicron has lowered growth expectations for the coming months. At the same time, the variant, which is more contagious, could push up prices if outbreaks worsen supply-chain bottlenecks and exacerbate labor shortages.</p><p>All that is complicating some central-bank decisions on how to phase out multitrillion-dollar stimulus programs and move to higher interest rates.</p><p>On Thursday, the ECB is expected to signal that it will continue buying bonds for some time, and that it won't increase interest rates next year. That is despite inflation that has reached 4.9%, the highest since records began in 1997.</p><p>In the U.K., economists and investors had until recently expected the BOE to raise rates at its meeting Thursday to contain inflation that was 4.2% in October, the highest in almost a decade. But the rapid spread of Omicron in the U.K. and last week's decision by the government to reimpose Covid-19 restrictions mean the bank may hold off on an increase, some economists say.</p><p>In China, the central bank acted last week to inject money into the economy in an effort to head off a fall in its vast housing market and rekindle growth.</p><p>By contrast, in the U.S., where the economy is expanding rapidly and inflation is highest among major economies, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to signal a faster wind-down of the bank's giant bond-buying program on Wednesday, likely setting the stage for U.S. interest-rate increases next year. A quicker pace would put the stimulus program on track to end in March instead of June. U.S. inflation surged to 6.8% in November, a 39-year high, the Labor Department said Friday.</p><p>The new variant poses a dilemma for some central banks: Should they simply wait to see its impact, or act pre-emptively?</p><p>Major central banks spent much of the year telling investors that the surge in consumer prices would prove temporary. They have dialed back those claims in recent weeks as inflation soared even higher. Global supply-chain bottlenecks, one cause of higher prices, are now expected to persist through at least the first half of 2022.</p><p>\"I think there is a concern that inflation isn't coming back down as quickly as people had felt and central banks need to react,\" said Iain Stealey, a portfolio manager with J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>Most businesses don't expect global inflation to peak until next year and nearly two-thirds have become more negative about global growth prospects over the past month, according to a survey of some of the world's largest companies by Oxford Economics, conducted shortly after the emergence of the Omicron variant. Roughly one-fifth now expect supply-chain disruptions to affect them beyond 2022, the survey found.</p><p>If central banks move too fast to curb inflation, they risk hobbling the economic recovery before it is complete. But if they wait too long, they might need to increase interest rates aggressively in the future, potentially triggering a recession.</p><p>---</p><p>Rates Likely to Rise</p><p>In U.S., Not in EU</p><p>Investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates two or three times next year, with the case for increases strengthened by Friday's inflation data, while European Central Bank officials have signaled that the bank is unlikely to raise rates at all in 2022.</p><p>The ECB's caution partly reflects concerns about Europe's highly indebted south, where government borrowing costs are edging up as investors anticipate a slowdown in ECB bond purchases, putting the recovery at risk, economists say.</p><p>\"In contrast to the ECB, the Fed is really getting out of the bond-buying business,\" said Commerzbank chief economist Jorg Kramer. \"The Fed simply doesn't have Italy to support.\"</p><p>The aggressive asset purchases by major central banks, especially the Fed and ECB, have been a vital crutch for emerging markets since the start of the pandemic, by flooding global markets with liquidity.</p><p>Emerging markets could now be squeezed as the flood of liquidity tapers off, U.S. interest rates rise and the dollar strengthens. Central banks in Brazil, Russia and Mexico have increased interest rates aggressively in recent months to shore up their currencies against the dollar and cool surging inflation.</p>",
