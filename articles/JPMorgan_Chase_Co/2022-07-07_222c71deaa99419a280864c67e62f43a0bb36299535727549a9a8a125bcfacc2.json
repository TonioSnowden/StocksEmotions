  "text": "<p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 245 points, or 0.8%, at 31,282.</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 47 points, or 1.2%, to 3,892.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP increased 229 points, or 2%, to 11,593.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 70 points, or 0.23%, to 31038, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 14 points, or 0.36%, to 3845, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 40 points, or 0.35%, to 11362.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the market higher as investors reacted to the fall in commodity prices over the past month, which has helped to cause a moderation in inflation expectations and a fall in bond yields. The shift has benefited growth stock valuations.</p><p>Even as crude oil prices recovered some ground on Thursday, they remained down nearly 20% over the past month, though energy stocks rallied on the day, reversing some recent losses. Chevron CVX rose 2.5%, while Exxon XOM gained 3%.</p><p>Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said economic growth fears that have triggered the pullback in commodity prices also have inspired a shift in thinking about the Federal Reserve's plans.</p><p>Investors increasingly are betting that the central bank won't need to be as aggressive with its interest rate hikes.</p><p>\"Markets right now are betting that the Fed is going to break and follow the economy, not necessarily inflation,\" Nolte said.</p><p>Instead, traders are hoping that the battering delivered to stocks this year means that there might be an opportunity for the market to be pleasantly surprised when the U.S. second quarter earnings reporting season enters full swing next week.</p><p>While awaiting Friday's jobs report, investors heard from several Fed officials, including Fed Gov. Christopher Waller who said he backs a 75 basis point rate hike later this month, and likely another 50 basis point increase in September. Waller also said recession worries are \"overblown.\"</p><p>Some analysts are wary though.</p><p>\"Stocks could see a second phase of bear market driven by earnings weakness. A trough is likely to come only when unemployment rates are close to peaking, which could be a year or so from now,\" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management.</p><p>\"Broad diversification, active tactical asset allocation and disciplined downside risk management will be key to navigate the bumpy road ahead,\" he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, equity investors appear to have decided that the minutes from the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting, released on Wednesday, contained little to be concerned about.</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up 8 basis points at 3%.</p><p>Data released Thursday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless insurance increasedby 4,000 last week, while the number of ongoing claims increased by 51,000. Investors are now looking ahead to Friday's payrolls report for the month of June. Nolte said that stocks might run out of steam later in the session as investors close out their positions ahead of the Friday morning report.</p><p>The U.S. also saw its trade deficit narrow in May, data that Capital Economics says could help bolster growth in the second quarter. Lately, investors have increasingly feared that the U.S. economy might see slow growth, or perhaps even a contraction, during the second quarter.</p><p>See: Hiring in U.S. likely fell to 18-month low in June —250,000 new jobs forecast</p><p>Single stock movers</p><p>* Shares of Micron MU, AMD AMD and Nvidia NVDA were all higher by more than 1% after South Korea's Samsung KR:005930 reported stronger than expectedearnings guidance.</p><p>* Freeport-McMoRan FCX, Schlumberger SLB and Diamondback Energy FANG, APA Corp. APA and Halliburton Co HAL. were all up more than 5% thanks to the rebound rally in oil.</p><p>* ON Semiconductor Corp. ON was also up on the Samsung news.</p><p>* Elevator maker Otis Worldwide Corp. OTIS slumped more than 2% on Thursday after a JP Morgan analyst expressed concerns about the stock's valuation.</p><p>Other markets</p><p>* Crude oil was firmer. West Texas Intermediate crude CL.1 CLQ22 rose 5% to climb back above $103 per barrel. The U.S. benchmark lost nearly $10 over the previous two sessions amid worries about easing global demand.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar Index DXY was down 0.1% to 107. On Wednesday, the dollar topped 107, its highest level in 19 years as worries about the European economy and political turmoil in the U.K. pressured the euro and sterling.</p><p>* Gold GC00 GCQ22rose 0.1% to $1,738 an ounce and silver SI00 added 0.8% to $19.25 an ounce.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD advanced by 22.9% to $20,860, but was still down nearly 70% from its record high, as traders warily eye recent turmoil in the crypto sector.</p><p>* In Europe, the STOXX Europe 600 XX:SXXP climbed 1.9%, while the FTSE 100 UK:UKX in London rose 1.1% after U.K media said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would resign. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP rose 0.3% and the Nikkei 225 index JP:NIK rose 1.4%.</p><p>—Jamie Chisholm contributed reporting to this article.</p><p>Dow up 250 points as investors await Friday job's report</p>",
