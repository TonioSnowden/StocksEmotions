  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Intercontinental Exchange has deepened its push into the US housing market data business, striking the largest deal in its history by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42af04d4-992a-4962-851e-15870c5a5a05\">agreeing to purchase</a> mortgage software company Black Knight for $13.1bn.</p> <h2>Has Tiger Global lost the plot?</h2> <p><strong>Chase Coleman </strong>has shown little interest in changing his stripes.</p> <p>The descendant of <strong>Julian Robertson</strong>'s <strong>Tiger Management </strong>clawed out from behind the shadow of his legendary former boss to launch the largest and most successful hedge fund of any of his fellow “Tiger Cubs”.</p> <p>Coleman's<strong> Tiger Global </strong>borrows from Robertson's signature long-short playbook, placing big bets on tech and shorting underperforming stocks.</p> <p>Like his mentor, Coleman positioned himself as a master stockpicker, prioritising long-term potential over valuations and yielding huge gains from stocks often considered expensive by traditional valuation metrics. He has built a huge private tech investing business with a similar ethos.</p> <p>The move-fast-and-break-things approach — piling into high-growth tech stocks while successfully shorting the losers — panned out particularly well in the coronavirus pandemic bull market. But times have changed.</p> <p>Tiger Global's flagship hedge fund lost 15.2 per cent in April, a person familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31ff7d44-f8a4-4cde-989e-50aa08301155\">told the FT</a>, and is down more than 40 per cent so far this year — one of the worst drawdowns in hedge fund history, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eadcb9c-e828-4385-b1c7-22029ee7dae8\">Alphaville notes</a>.</p> <p>“April added to a very disappointing start to 2022 for our public funds. Markets have not been co-operative given the macroeconomic backdrop, but we do not believe in excuses and so will not offer any,” the firm's investment team wrote in a letter to investors seen by the FT, adding that it would continue to manage the portfolio as described in its Q1 letter.</p> <p>Coleman sticking to his guns shouldn't come as a surprise to investors. “Tiger is long tech. That is their job. If you don't want to be long tech, don't own Tiger,” one Tiger Global investor told DD's Antoine Gara.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31dcd748-26d2-4f7a-ad3d-a3efc05c0f25'\">bottleneck in the IPO pipeline</a> — brought on by increased market volatility, lacklustre IPO performances and the fizzling Spac frenzy — has also taken a toll. </p> <p>Tiger's fall from grace reminds DD of a similar case last year when <strong>Melvin Capital</strong>, which runs a pretty aggressive short book, suffered heavy losses after betting against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f6b47f9-70c7-4839-8bb4-6a62f1bd39e0\">meme-stock darling</a> <strong>Gamestop. </strong></p> <p>The fallout was so bad that founder <strong>Gabe Plotkin</strong>'s old boss<strong> Steve Cohen </strong>and <strong>Citadel'</strong>s <strong>Ken Griffin </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1791269f-fe8c-47e3-b933-62125ee83242\">stepped in</a> with a capital infusion to save the day. But things haven't gotten any better. Melvin has lost a further 20.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>Coleman and Plotkin are both facing a dilemma that even their most deep-pocketed allies can't fix: performance fee structures.</p> <p>Hedge funds have long maintained so-called high-water marks, which prohibit them from charging performance fees until losses have been recovered. Last month, Plotkin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77d85908-c17e-4588-ade4-a4d513c4b781\">backpedalled</a> on his own efforts to change the rules after facing searing investor backlash. </p> <p>Without the broader tech market on its side, it'll be difficult for Tiger Global to stage a comeback any time soon — let alone start charging performance fees again.</p> <h2>The ex-KKR dealmaker waging a campaign on a K-Pop machine</h2> <p>Activists have historically held little sway in South Korea.</p> <p>The industry has long been viewed there as predatory foreign funds engaging in what is known locally as “eat and run”.&#xa0;</p> <p>After campaigning against a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7cef15c-0a5b-11e5-82e4-00144feabdc0\">contentious merger</a> in 2015 of <strong>Samsung</strong>'s construction and chemicals subsidiaries, <strong>Elliott Management</strong> was berated in the press as a “parasite”. Its founder, <strong>Paul Singer</strong>, was caricatured on <strong>Samsung C&amp;T</strong>'s website as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59a40d52-2a0f-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca\">bespectacled vulture</a>.</p> <p>Thirty-five-year old <strong>Changhwan Lee</strong>, who left <strong>KKR </strong>last year to set up his own activist fund in Seoul, sees an opening for change.</p> <p>“Everyone in the Korean stock market is frustrated by local companies not realising their value because of poor governance,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5202ee36-e2a3-45ee-a920-d91e0951e2bc\">told the FT's Christian Davies</a>. “It's been like that for 20 years.”</p> <p>For months, the millennial activist has been waging a campaign to improve governance at <strong>SM Entertainment</strong>, the publicly traded K-pop factory behind popular artists including singer/songwriter <strong>Ryeowook</strong> and rapper <strong>Taeyong</strong>.</p> <p>Lee's <strong>Align Partners</strong>, which holds a 0.9 per cent stake in SM and has just $65mn in assets under management, successfully campaigned for an independent auditor on SME's board — a decisive victory against the company's founder and controlling shareholder<strong> Soo-man “SM” Lee</strong>, who has stacked the music group's board with relatives, childhood friends and other allies.</p> <p>It's an important win for activists in Korea Inc., where corporate behemoths including Samsung and <strong>Hyundai </strong>operate without much interference. A bigger change will come, according to Lee, when the country's growing army of retail investors begins to leverage its power over the market.</p> <p><strong>Aston Martin puts a new driver in the hot seat</strong></p> <p>The hardest part of keeping the <strong>James Bond </strong>franchise alive is changing the lead.</p> <p><strong>Aston Martin</strong>, whose sleek models saturated the Craig-era flicks, has a similar quandary.</p> <p>The luxury carmaker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db433c25-c209-4c0b-8320-08e9623dcc9d\">abruptly parted ways</a> with chief executive <strong>Tobias Moers</strong> on Wednesday, with the former <strong>Mercedes</strong> engineer making way for one-time boss of <strong>Ferrari</strong>, <strong>Amedeo Felisa</strong>, the FT's Peter Campbell reports.</p> <p><strong>Lawrence Stroll</strong>, the company's chair and owner, decried that the change was needed for the next chapter in a turnround that he hopes will rekindle Aston's fortunes and bring it within touching distance of Ferrari as a hallmark for luxury motoring. </p> <p>But Moers' departure has been brewing for months, if not longer, and is largely down to the robust management style of the German.</p> <p>Dozens of senior executives have left the business during Moers' two years at the helm, high churn even by the standards of the most rigorous corporate turnround.</p> <p>Stroll was forced to deny in January that he planned to switch out Moers, after the undercurrent of rumours broke the surface. </p> <p>At a private dinner between the pair the following week, Stroll told Moers to improve morale in the business that had fallen to near-rock bottom. Things improved, but the damage was done. </p> <p>The biggest question is how long 76-year-old Felisa, who ran Ferrari until 2016, plans to stay. </p> <p>Coupled with the announcement was a set of first-quarter results that reminded investors of the long road ahead. Pre-tax losses mounted after depreciation of investments into older cars, while payments on its high-interest debt continue to sap what profitability is left. </p> <p>For all its Bondian sheen, Felisa is taking hold of a business that is brittle. Try to bring it back in one piece.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has promoted <strong>Jeremy Capstick</strong> to global co-head of market infrastructure.
