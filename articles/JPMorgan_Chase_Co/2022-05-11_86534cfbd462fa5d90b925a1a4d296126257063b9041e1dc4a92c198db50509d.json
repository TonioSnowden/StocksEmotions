  "text": "<p>\"These headwinds created a drag on revenue estimated to be approximately $2 million in the quarter, which would have represented an additional 15% year-over-year growth in our international business,\" said Joey Zwillinger, co-founder and co-chief executive of Allbirds BIRD, on the earnings call, according to a Motley Fool transcript.</p><p>\"As we look at the balance of 2022, we are managing to a more conservative outlook to reflect what we believe are transitory factors affecting our international business. We believe that the impact of full year revenue will be approximately $15 million to $20 million, which is reflected in the guidance we're providing today.\"</p><p>Allbirds' new outlook is for revenue of $335 million to $345 million, down from $355 million and $365 million previously. Shares of the sustainable shoe company sank nearly 11% in early Wednesday trading after the guidance adjustment.</p><p>Shares sank 10.7% in Wednesday trading after the earnings announcement. The stock has sunk 73.2% for the year to date.</p><p>See: Under Armour price targets slashed as supply chain headwinds challenge margins</p><p>\"We continue to view the scale-up of our international business as an important element of our growth algorithm. Having invested early in regions like Europe and Asia, we believe we have established a broad foundation from which to grow as we strive to elevate our brand awareness into a consumer set that is at least as large as the opportunity in the U.S.,\" Zwillinger said.</p><p>U.S. revenue for the quarter was up 35% while international revenue grew 3%. Revenue for the quarter totaled $62.8 million, up from $49.6 million last year and just above the FactSet consensus for $62.0 million.</p><p>\"Investor skepticism in this name was already high, and the guide down is not going to convert many doubters to believers,\" wrote Wedbush analysts.</p><p>\"Silver linings, however, include the strong U.S. growth, positive commentary around early wholesale sell-throughs, plans for more cautious expense growth in 2H (getting the company to EBITDA breakeven in 2H), and the fact that the guidance cut embeds a fairly draconian international scenario.\"</p><p>Wedbush rates Allbirds stock outperform and trimmed its price target to $7 from $8.</p><p>\"We acknowledge external challenges (Ukraine, China COVID restrictions, FX, supply chain, etc.) and are encouraged by attention to expense management but business momentum is underwhelming relative to expectations,\" said Stifel.</p><p>\"In the context of both the external disruptions and the rerating of the valuation, we believe the current share price undervalues the business, franchise, and asset including sustainable materials intellectual property.\"</p><p>Stifel rates Allbirds stock buy and slashed its price target to $7 from $20.</p><p>And: Etsy is setting its sights on male shoppers</p><p>Allbirds said stores were a big growth driver, with U.S. retail growing 150% year-over-year.</p><p>\"[W]e see 'early innings' growth of +20-30%, with Allbirds' positioning versus peers differentiated through minimalist 'evergreen' product designs, innovative and novel materials science, and a digitally led omni-channel approach,\" said JPMorgan.</p><p>\"That being said, Allbirds' growth is highly dependent on new store growth contributions, new product launches, and brand awareness growth.\"</p><p>JPMorgan rates Allbirds shares neutral with a $7 price target, down from $12.</p><p>Allbirds' international business takes a hit from war in Ukraine, COVID in China</p>",
