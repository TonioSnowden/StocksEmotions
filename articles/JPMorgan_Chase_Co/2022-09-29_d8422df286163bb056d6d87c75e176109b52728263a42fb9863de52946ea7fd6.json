  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which household expenses have you pulled back on recently? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Other examples of some sticky-priced services include haircuts, which have risen 4.4% from a year ago, or car repairs, which are up 11%, according to the Labor Department's August consumer-price index. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, items such as gas or your electric bill may rise and fall depending on a variety of factors, but a sticky item like the cost of your haircut will take longer to fall after a price hike, eating a bigger share of your budget from here on out.</p><p>The sticky-price CPI, an economic indicator calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, can help gauge which costs in your life might stay high for months to come.</p><p>The sticky-price CPI tracks a basket of items within the broader CPI tracked by the Labor Department. These sticky items tend to have costs resistant to change. The Atlanta Fed labels an item as \"flexible\" when its price changes more frequently than every four or so months and sticky when a price change takes longer than the same amount of time to budge.</p><p>On the Atlanta Fed's sticky list: household furnishings, baby clothes, alcohol, education, public transportation and medical care. On the flexible: fresh fruits and vegetables, clothing and shoes. (The list of items in the sticky basket are fixed.)</p><p>Consumer prices rose more slowly in August, 8.3% year over year compared with 8.5% recorded in July. Prices for sticky goods and services, meanwhile, rose 7.7% in August, accelerating from a 5.4% rise in July. On a year-over-year basis, the index increased by 6.1%.</p><p>These sticky prices are part of the reason inflation can be so hard to stamp out, economists say. Sticky inflation makes it even harder for people to make financial plans, and the supply-chain crisis and pandemic shutdowns also changed the nature of these price changes, said Brent Meyer, assistant vice president and economist at the Atlanta Fed.</p><p>\"One thing we've seen during the pandemic is that the set of prices that we pull and call 'sticky,' we've seen some of those prices increase more rapidly and be more volatile than they would be outside of a pandemic,\" Mr. Meyer said.</p><p>Comparing the change in sticky and flexible prices won't help Americans predict the future necessarily, said Jordan Jackson, global market strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. But it can help when deciding what purchases to hold off on, what to buy now, and where to make sacrifices and trade-offs in their budgets.</p><p>\"Some prices, like for tomatoes, we can expect to change every three weeks,\" Mr. Jackson said. \"But for other items you may take 6½ years to see any sort of price changes.\"</p><p>Someone shopping for a refrigerator, which tends to have a sticky price, according to the Atlanta Fed, might expect to see prices fluctuate from $2,000 to $2,200, but not to $4,000, he said.</p><p>Many sticky prices are likely to remain elevated, and bigger-ticket items, such as furniture, which is up 7.1% over the past year, and appliances, which are up 3%, according to the CPI, won't be falling in price soon—and could get more expensive.</p><p>\"We're seeing this area of persistent upward movement, which is not necessarily the most comforting signal when it comes to the trajectory of overall inflation,\" Mr. Meyer said.</p><p>Americans have already figured out several pieces of the budgeting puzzle. People know to make substitutions, seek out deals and shop around for the lowest prices possible. Sustained high prices may push people to cut their budgets down even more as it becomes harder to pay for necessities.</p><p>\"It's hard to make your budget decisions when you're not sure how much things are going to cost and how much things are going to cost in the future,\" said Randall Wright, professor of finance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p>Write to Julia Carpenter at julia.carpenter@wsj.com</p><p>The 'Sticky' High Prices Unlikely to Come Down Any Time Soon</p>",
