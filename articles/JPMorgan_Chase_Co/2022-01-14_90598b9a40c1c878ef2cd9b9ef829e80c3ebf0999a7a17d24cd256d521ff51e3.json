  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 274 points, or 0.8%, to 35,826, weighed by declines in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and American Express Co. AXP</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX gave up 15 points, or 0.3%, to around 4,643.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP fell 22 points, or 0.2%, to reach 14,782.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow fell 177 points, or 0.49%, to 36114, the S&amp;P 500 declined 67 points, or 1.42%, to 4659, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 382 points, or 2.51%, to 14807.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Markets were experiencing unsettled trade on Friday.</p><p>Comments from several Federal Reserve speakers this week showed central bank officials were thinking about making as many as five interest rate increases in 2022, though three increases is what the dot plot of economic projections by policy makers is currently forecasting.</p><p>That dynamic could offer a tough road ahead for stocks that have previously enjoyed a regime of rates at or near 0%.</p><p>Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller on Wednesday suggested that as many as five interest-rate increases are a possibility in 2022 as the central bank aims to beat back rampant inflation. Though the policy maker said his baseline expectation was for three rate increases on the year, which is more in line with expectations.</p><p>“The three-day U.S. tech rally fell apart, despite Treasury yields moving lower, following a selection of updates from Fed speakers in the past couple of days,” said Ian Williams, a strategist at U.K. broker Peel Hunt.'</p><p>On top of that, U.S. retail sales&#xa0;dropped by 1.9%&#xa0;in December as the omicron variant of the disease that causes COVID-19 spread, undercutting consumer buying. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.1% decline in December retail sales. The figures are seasonally adjusted.</p><p>Such sales activity are seen as a major part of consumer spending and offer cues on the strength of the U.S. economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. industrial output fell 0.1% in December after a revised 0.7% gain in prior month and industrial capacity use edged down to 76.5% last month versus 76.6% in prior month.</p><p>And a closely followed gauge of consumer sentiment fell to 68.8 in January from 70.6 in the prior month, marking the second-lowest reading in a decade, with omicron concerns partly attributed to its drop-off.</p><p>Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said that the fall in consumer sentiment reflects the pain lower-income Americans are facing amid inflation.</p><p>“January's Consumer Sentiment reading starkly underscores how high inflation hurts lower-income households most,” he wrote in emailed comments.</p><p>“Sentiment fell sharply for households earning less than $100,000, but rose for those earning above that level. Especially with energy and food prices so high, which take up a much higher percentage of lower-income budgets than other expenses, financial stress is mounting on the 70% of U.S. households below the $100,000 threshold,” he said.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and Wells FargoWFC each reported stronger fourth-quarter earnings than forecast. CitigroupCposted a decline in its quarterly profit. Citi's shares were down 2.2%, those for Wells Fargo were up 3.2% and JPMorgan Chase's stock was down 4.6%.</p><p>Asset manager BlackRockBLK reported that its assets under management reached $10 trillion. However, its stock was down 2.2%.</p><p>Shares of paint-maker Sherwin-Williams SHWwere down nearly 2% after it lowered its guidance, citing supply shortages.</p><p>Tesla's stockTSLA was in focus after its CEO, Elon Musk, said the electric-vehicle maker would accept meme asset dogecoinDOGEUSD as payment for some merchandise. Shares of Tesla were up 1.5% while dogecoin changed hands at 19.6 cents, up about 19%.</p>",
