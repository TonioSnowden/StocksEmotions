  "text": "<p>What did Avaya's bosses know and when did they know it? The troubled US telecom company raised $600mn of new debt in June in the form of a new loan plus convertible bonds. These were hairy transactions. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/b5bf5983-0487-4945-8ba5-daaa23bef21a\">Avaya</a> was already struggling with heavy leverage and an underlying business in decline. Then everything got worse.</p> <p>In late July, the company replaced its chief executive. It also said that its ebitda forecast for the quarter would come in at just a third of its previously weak forecast — a shocking reduction.</p> <p>Naturally, buyers of the June debt offerings are wondering why Avaya deteriorated so quickly. Some have hired lawyers to advise them on their legal options.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the company announced quarterly results consistent with its reduced outlook. It said the board of directors had launched an investigation into the circumstances of the profits warning.</p> <p>Avaya's market worth has fallen to under $100mn, squashed by a debt load of $3bn. Its existing senior loans trade at under 70 cents.</p> <p>The new senior term loan, sold by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, came with a juicy interest rate that exceeded 10 per cent. It was reportedly the highest yielding loan of its kind this year. The buyers, some of them existing Avaya creditors, were sophisticated Wall Street investors. They negotiated onerous legal terms to protect their investment.</p> <p>Avaya also said on Tuesday its status as a “going concern” was in doubt. That signals an approaching bankruptcy. For years, companies like Avaya have taken advantage of loose financial conditions to raise money repeatedly hoping to gain wriggle room for turnrounds. But, with interest rates rising and the economy softening, such opportunities are diminishing.</p> <p>The actions of Avaya and its bankers merit searching scrutiny. The timing of the financing and the profits warning raise awkward questions.</p> <p>With hindsight, Avaya should have made a public reckoning of its situation earlier this summer and comprehensively restructured its debt. For investors, the takeaway is that high yields always come with high risks.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Avaya: messy rescue financing shows an earlier reckoning was in order' FT.com 9 August.
