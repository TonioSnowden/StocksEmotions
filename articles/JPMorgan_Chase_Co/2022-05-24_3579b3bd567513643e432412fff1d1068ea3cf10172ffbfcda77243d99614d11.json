But sometimes it's not executed well. </p> <p>Last week <strong>Stuart Kirk</strong>,<strong> HSBC Asset Management</strong>'s global head of responsible investing and a former FT journalist, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1716d9fb-4c8f-4d05-a6b4-bb02a48a73a4\">told a room full of people</a> who had gathered to talk about ESG concerns that they should ignore “unsubstantiated, shrill hyperbole” about climate change. </p> <p>You don't have to be a climate scientist to figure out how that went down. </p> <p>On Sunday the FT's Owen Walker revealed that Kirk <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e1a16ea-bf63-45f8-81af-dc41c0df4e06\">had been suspended</a> as a result of his bluntly delivered presentation at the FT Moral Money Summit, titled “why investors need not worry about climate risk”.</p> <p>While the bank has more pressing issues to address, including its troubles with China, Kirk's comments have taken centre stage.</p> <p>The backlash was swift. Environmentalists and other ESG investors have called for Kirk's head on a platter. </p> <p> <strong>Nicolas Moreau</strong>, the head of HSBC's asset management arm, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1716d9fb-4c8f-4d05-a6b4-bb02a48a73a4\">one of the first to distance himself</a> from Kirk's comments. </p> <p><strong>Noel Quinn</strong>, HSBC's chief executive, took a couple of days to come out with his statement. “I do not agree — at all — with the remarks made at [this] week's FT Moral Money Summit,” he wrote on LinkedIn this weekend. The lender's chief sustainability officer <strong>Celine Herweijer</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6933487850713722880/\">voiced her own rebuttal</a> on the social media platform.</p> <p>This may all have come as a bit of a surprise to Kirk. People with knowledge of the event's planning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e1a16ea-bf63-45f8-81af-dc41c0df4e06\">told the FT</a> that&#xa0;Kirk's presentation was given the green light internally before Kirk spoke on Thursday. </p> <p>Details are still murky on how a presentation that has ruffled so many feathers in HSBC's top ranks had ostensibly made it past its PR team. </p> <p>Kirk also used his stage time to make several jabs at <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, the former <strong>Bank of England</strong> governor and <strong>Brookfield</strong>'s head of transition investing. “The Mark Carneys of this world have to convince us all that every single one of us is wrong on climate risk. That's possible, but it's a big call to make,” he said.</p> <p>Both Carney and Herweijer are set to appear on a panel at Davos on Wednesday morning moderated by Martin Wolf. DD's Arash Massoudi is on the ground in Switzerland to listen in on the discussion.</p> <p>DD's take is that climate change is important. However, it shouldn't just be used as a buzzword or marketing gimmick. Kirk has raised important questions about greenwashing and whether companies that appear to be environmentally friendly really are. That's something worth exploring. </p> <h2>Michael Dell's OG ‘funding secured' deal</h2> <p>During their effort to buy technology conglomerate <strong>EMC</strong> <strong>Corporation</strong> for $67bn in 2016, a pivotal moment for PC mogul <strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Dell</strong> and his dealmaking partner <strong>Egon</strong> <strong>Durban</strong> of <strong>Silver</strong> <strong>Lake</strong> occurred in the law offices of <strong>Skadden Arps</strong>.</p> <p>EMC's board was meeting at the law firm to vet the takeover bid but was unsure whether they had the cash to close. Dell and Durban's wild card was <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> boss <strong>Jamie</strong> <strong>Dimon</strong>.</p> <p>“They've got the money,” Dimon told EMC's board, as recounted by DD's Antoine Gara in his final Forbes Magazine <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2021/08/03/deal-of-the-century-how-michael-dell-turned-his-declining-pc-business-into-40-billion-windfall/?sh=405d0b295c2a\">cover story</a> before joining the FT. “We'll do the whole deal.”</p> <p>Having the head of the largest bank in America standing behind your financing package is the “funding secured” any dealmaker can only dream of. </p> <p>Dell and Silver Lake's gargantuan return on the takeover indicated Dimon made the right call.</p> <p>Chipmaker <strong>Broadcom</strong> is in talks to acquire <strong>VMware</strong>, the crown jewel asset that Dell and Durban acquired when taking control of EMC, in a deal that could fetch the software group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0978baf-cb16-4603-8019-a2a802c8e7e6\">more than $50bn</a>.</p> <p>VMware shares surged about 20 per cent on Monday, putting Dell's 36 per cent holding at a $17.6bn valuation and Silver Lake's holding worth nearly $5bn. If Broadcom moves forward, it would cement a big windfall for the duo.</p> <p>Dell kept VMware independently managed with a 19 per cent stake listed on public markets, but combined the remainder of EMC inside his bigger enterprise technology mothership <strong>Dell</strong> <strong>Technologies</strong>.</p> <p>After selling off non-core assets to pay down debt in November, Dell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ca808da-d0a7-4f42-98c4-b49745289616\">spun off its 81 per cent ownership</a> of <strong>VMware</strong> and pulled a $12bn dividend out of the cloud computing company to deleverage.</p> <p>Net debt at Dell has fallen from $40bn in 2020 to about $17bn presently, as it nears $100bn in annual sales. Michael Dell owns a stake in Dell worth more than $14bn, while Silver Lake's shares are worth nearly $4bn.</p> <p>The coup underscores that arcane technological infrastructure companies such as VMware are the big money makers on Wall Street, and where deal activity remains strong. </p> <h2>The executive tasked with enticing IPOs to Hong Kong</h2> <p><strong>Nicolas ‘Gucho' Aguzin</strong>, the chief executive of Hong Kong's stock exchange, arrived at Davos this week with a cardinal mission: drumming up enthusiasm for foreign investment in Chinese companies. </p> <p>The challenge is doing it just as China sentiment among global investors is more negative than at any time in recent memory.</p> <p>It caps a difficult first year in the job for the former JPMorgan banker, who is the first non-Chinese person to run<strong> HKEX </strong>and does not speak Mandarin.</p> <p>Total equity fundraising is at the lowest level since the global financial crisis and the market value of HKEX has fallen about a quarter, or roughly $19bn.</p> <p>Much of the blame can be thrust on HKEX's over-reliance on listings by mainland Chinese companies, which account for almost 80 per cent of its $4.8tn stock market. Beijing's zero-Covid and national security measures have shifted mood for global investors, wiping trillions of dollars off the value of the country's biggest tech companies. HKEX is critically exposed. </p> <p>On top of that, more than two years of effectively closed borders has damaged Hong Kong's reputation among international finance as an accessible place to conduct business.</p> <p>Gucho — a childhood nickname that is even used by his old boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> — is a firm believer that maintaining capital flows between China and the world is the key to avoid geopolitical tensions escalating into conflicts. </p> <p>The Argentine-born chief executive spent April in mainland China meeting officials in Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. He was given a fresh mandate by officials to make sure Hong Kong is “plugged into the international market”, he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f50e937-cf08-4a4d-b225-f0a7204023c5\">told the FT's Tabby Kinder and Hudson Lockett</a>. </p> <p>It's a tall order considering the “listing traffic jam” — as described by an executive close to the exchange — that has resulted from deteriorating US-China relations and Beijing's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a21d88c-1d63-497e-ad10-aa7a5b14052f\">regulatory crackdown</a>.</p> <p>Aguzin must also look outside of China and persuade more international companies to list in Hong Kong if he wants to boost the exchange's fortunes.</p> <p>HKEX's failed tilt at acquiring the<strong> London Stock Exchange</strong> in 2019 under his predecessor <strong>Charles Li</strong> now looks like a missed opportunity more than ever.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields </strong>has hired <strong>Jenny Hochenberg</strong> as a partner in its corporate and M&amp;A practice, based in New York. She joins from <strong>Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Gonzalo Ardura </strong>has been promoted to head of investment banking for Spain at<strong> Barclays</strong>, where he has been a managing director since 2018. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Cloud capital</strong> Capitolis, a Silicon Valley start-up that aims to repurpose locked-up capital into new banking products, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-airbnb-of-wall-street-wants-to-free-up-trapped-bank-capital-11653256576?mod=hp_lista_pos1\">could revolutionise</a> banks' role in the financial system, the Wall Street Journal reports. But it requires undoing crisis-era safeguards.</p> <p><strong>Disorder in the court</strong> A landmark EU directive in 2011 was meant to boost safeguards for whistleblowers in Germany. More than a decade on, those who raise red flags in Europe's biggest economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/280144a6-146b-450f-b061-05d63ffacef1\">still find themselves in legal purgatory</a>, the FT writes.</p> <p><strong>Private equity under fire </strong>Buyout firms have used “roll-up” acquisitions to control large swaths of the economy. The top US antitrust enforcer told DD's James Fontanella-Khan that the practice <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f222e618-dc96-4204-8a27-00e0a9316236\">deserves more scrutiny</a>.</p> <p><strong>News round-up</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b72d9946-de2a-450d-906c-9d9ad7d786d3\">Chelsea Football Club sale set for approval after Abramovich meets ‘red lines'</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ea2b194-3575-4b7b-9a61-521abdbb1602\">Didi investors vote to delist in US in bid to revive China business</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/abu-dhabi-based-borouge-sets-ipo-price-gets-seven-cornerstone-investors-2022-05-23/\">Abu Dhabi's Borouge secures cornerstone investors including India's Adani family</a> (Reuters)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de8c79d4-0d9a-4901-bf43-7251838007a5\">Clifford Chance raises pay for newly qualified lawyers to £125,000 a year</a> (FT) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9aca4ded-e5b7-4009-836b-6b2cf1a8f340\">JPMorgan shares leap after bank raises interest income target</a> (FT + <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d50d442-bb31-4aca-8773-e089bb51fadb\">Lex</a>) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d459f435-edff-412c-85a5-0961d50aba69\">Binance promoted terra as ‘safe' investment before $40bn collapse</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/credit-agricole-italy-expressed-interest-banco-bpms-insurance-business-2022-05-23/\">Crédit Agricole Italy interested in Banco BPM's insurance business</a> (Reuters) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d49fcc62-43a3-4a84-8e4a-e57f28e8386c\">Swedish fintech Klarna to cut 10% of workforce</a> (FT + <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/595f91a3-8052-4f74-b73b-2c3cc710e6ce\">Lex</a>)</p><p>Source:  2022 'The HSBC banker suspended for speaking his mind' FT.com 24 May.
