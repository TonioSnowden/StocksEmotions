  "title": "Derby's Take: Economists See Fed Penciling In Two 2022 Rate Increases at FOMC Meeting; Some expect the central bank to raise rates in June",
  "text": "<p>The Fed is on track to wrap up its bond purchases as it confronts inflation pressures that are both much higher and longer lasting than officials had once expected. Those pressures, coupled with steady improvements in the job market, may be advancing the date for when the Fed will need to start countering them by raising its now near zero short-term target interest rate range.</p><p>Fed officials, even those on the front lines of calling for an accelerated pace for reducing asset purchases, have been notably reticent to say when they would like to see the central bank raise rates. But by ending its bond buying sooner than anticipated, the Fed would gain more flexibility in terms of timing for raising rates.</p><p>St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard said earlier this month the Fed needs to be \"nimble\" and has been an early proponent of paring asset buying. As for the timing of a rate increase, \"what I want is to be able to assess the data in the early part of the spring there and just see where we are, and then I think we can chart outâ€¦possible paths\" for rate increases, he said.</p><p>At the Fed's September policy meeting, the last one where it updated forecasts, officials' median interest rate projection had one quarter-percentage point rate increase for next year. Now, many forecasters at big banks expect to see more increases projected for 2022.</p><p>Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at bond investment fund Pimco, said in a note to clients on Friday that following the release of November's very strong consumer inflation data, she sees the Fed's taper pace doubling. She added that \"we also expect that the median rate path to imply two rate hikes in 2022, followed by another three in 2023, and four in 2024.\"</p><p>Ms. Wilding noted that while that would be an aggressive change by historical standards for the Fed, there is the potential for the central bank to project something even more robust for rate increases.</p><p>Two rate increases next year is a common view among forecasters, starting with, according to Ms. Wilding, an increase in June. In a note to clients on Friday, J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli offered a similar take, writing that the bank has adjusted its forecast, now expecting liftoff in June instead of next September, \"followed by a quarterly pace of hikes thereafter.\"</p><p>Even a former Fed insider expects a more aggressive turn by the central bank to try to tame inflation pressures. On Wednesday, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in a Bloomberg opinion article that he sees the Fed penciling in three increases for next year.</p><p>The big test for this shift in monetary policy expectations will be how inflation behaves next year. The Fed's baseline case has been to tie the surge in inflation to disruptions driven by the pandemic. While inflation has come in much higher than expected and has broadened in a way Fed officials are collectively concerned about, key officials still expect price pressures to ease sometime next year.</p><p>If price pressures do wane, that could strip away the urgency behind raising rates. If they don't, then the Fed will be in position to act without shocking markets too much, although there remain serious questions about whether higher rates can counter inflation created by a supply shock. That said, to the extent that high demand is also behind the surge in prices, steeper borrowing costs could help lower inflation, although that may not help the job market.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
