  "text": "<p>Citigroup Inc.'s first-quarter profit fell 46%, dragged down by higher expenses and potential losses from its exposure to Russia.</p><p>Profit fell to $4.31 billion, or $2.02 per share, compared with analysts' forecast for $1.43 per share. A year ago, Citi posted a profit of $7.94 billion, or $3.62 per share.</p><p>Revenue fell 2% to $19.19 billion but topped Wall Street's expectations for $18.19 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>The bank had $755 million in net credit charges for souring or potentially souring loans, a reversal from the prior year, when it had a $2.1 billion benefit.</p><p>Citigroup set aside $1.9 billion for potential loan losses from its exposures in Russia and the broader impact of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Citigroup has a bigger presence in Russia, including a retail bank, than other U.S. banks. It has been racing to reduce the exposure to Russia, cutting it to $7.8 billion from $9.8 billion in December. Its most up-to-date forecast shows it expects to lose a maximum of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down from the nearly $5 billion it had earlier warned was possible.</p><p>The bank also said it would exit commercial banking in Russia, but said it will continue working for large corporate clients there. About 85% of those clients are based outside of Russia, it said.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said Wednesday it was budgeting for higher losses because of the war in Ukraine. JPMorgan also took some losses related to commodities like nickel, which have been volatile since the invasion.</p><p>Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser is pushing a new strategy that includes selling international consumer businesses while expanding wealth management and business banking. The changes required shuffling some business reporting lines, and Thursday is the first period with its new internal structure.</p><p>Revenue in the institutional clients group, which includes investment banking and trading, fell 2% to $11.16 billion and profit dropped 51% on expenses and the Russian credit charges.</p><p>The consumer side, now named personal banking and global wealth management, reported revenue of $5.91 billion, down 1% from a year ago. Its profit fell 23%.</p><p>Total expenses rose 15% to $13.17 billion. The bank is under regulatory orders to complete a costly internal project to strengthen its risk systems.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup's First-Quarter Earnings Drop 46%</p>",
