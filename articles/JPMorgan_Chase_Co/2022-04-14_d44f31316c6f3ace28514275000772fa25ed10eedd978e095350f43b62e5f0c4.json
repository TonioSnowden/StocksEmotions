  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley performed better than expected in the first quarter as its M&amp;A and trading businesses helped to offset a slowdown in equity underwriting and wealth management amid the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>The Wall Street lender on Thursday said net income fell 11 per cent to $3.5bn, or $2.04 per share, down from $4bn, or $2.22 per share in the same period last year. However, that beat analysts' average estimate of $3bn, or $1.7 per share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p> <p>Net revenues for the first quarter were $14.8bn, down 6 per cent from $15.7bn a year earlier, but again were higher than analysts' expectations for $14.2bn.</p> <p>Chief executive James Gorman said the bank had delivered “strong” profitability “in the face of market volatility and economic uncertainty, demonstrating the resilience of our global diversified business”.</p> <p>Investment banking revenue plunged 37 per cent to $1.6bn, missing analysts' estimates for $1.8bn. While M&amp;A advisory earnings almost doubled, equity underwriting fell 82 per cent as the special purpose acquisition companies (Spac) boom subsided and the initial public offering market dried up amid the war in Ukraine and surging inflationary pressures.</p> <p>Rival JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday also reported a drop in investment banking revenue, as did Goldman Sachs on Thursday.</p> <p>Revenues from trading, which benefited from market turbulence caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising interest rates, rose slightly to $6bn compared with the same quarter in 2021, which itself was a bumper three months for the division. That comfortably beat forecasts for $4.84bn.</p> <p>Fixed-income trading revenues were $2.9bn, versus estimates for $2.1bn, while income from equities was $3.1bn, exceeding expectations for $2.59bn.</p> <p>“Our model was tested and we performed,” chief financial officer Sharon Yeshaya said in an interview.</p> <p>“As it relates to Russia, we exited the country a few years ago and gave up our banking licence, so the direct financial impact was limited,” she said. “The second-order volatility in the marketplace I cannot predict . . . [but] we are always subject to it and we'll all have to deal with that.”</p> <p>Revenues in wealth management, which includes online trading platform ETrade, were little changed year on year at $5.9bn, missing estimates for $6.2bn. </p> <p>Yeshaya said the performance demonstrated the “resiliency of our wealth management platform” and that the expected rise in interest rates “should only be more beneficial for margins”. The bank had previously said it hoped for an extra $500mn in net interest income in 2022.</p> <p>In investment management, revenue was up marginally to $1.3bn, bolstered by the integration of asset manager Eaton Vance, a deal that was completed in March 2021.</p> <p>The shares rose 1 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley disclosed in February that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d14c8bf-d6fd-4cb0-b654-9dfdc4254bc1\">examining its block trading business</a> since 2019. The Department of Justice subsequently started its own investigation.</p> <p>Yeshaya declined to comment on the status of the regulatory and internal probes into the affair.</p> <p>Separately, billionaire Elon Musk said on Thursday he had hired Morgan Stanley as his adviser on his $43.4bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1b87776-2f7d-459d-9671-f3e58f79fc73\">takeover bid</a> for Twitter.</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris in London and Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Morgan Stanley beats expectations as M&amp;A and trading cushion impact of war in Ukraine' FT.com 14 April.
