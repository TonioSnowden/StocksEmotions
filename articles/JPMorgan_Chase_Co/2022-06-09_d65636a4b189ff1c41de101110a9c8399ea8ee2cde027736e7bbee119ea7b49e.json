  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>Citigroup <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d28409-54c0-4106-a428-475acec4a332\">has been given</a> the go-ahead for a court bid to shut down three UK companies in Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, a move that would hit large swathes of the metals magnate's British operations and put hundreds of jobs at risk.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter:&#xa0;</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Credit Suisse risks striking out&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>The death of Spacs?&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Greensill saga reverberates in UK village</p></li> </ul> <h2>Chaotic drift at Credit Suisse</h2> <p>As comebacks go, this week's efforts by <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> rank among the shortest-lived.</p> <p><strong>David Miller</strong>, the Swiss lender's global head of investment banking and capital markets, gave a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-07/-we-are-back-credit-suisse-s-top-banker-signals-new-swagger\">tiggerish interview</a> to Bloomberg published on Tuesday afternoon, proclaiming that: “I've been using the entire first five months of this year running around seeing clients and telling them we are back.”</p> <p>It's a bold statement given that Credit Suisse has stumbled from one crisis to another over the past three years — from an embarrassing corporate spying scandal, to a hugely damaging fund suspension, a multi-billion- dollar trading loss and a swathe of lawsuits from clients and shareholders. Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3b8e2a8-36c9-4c2c-906f-3c07082fde3b\">says the bank</a> is suffering from “chaotic drift”.</p> <p>Miller's boosterism included baseball analogies (“we're in the last three innings, not in the first three innings of this turnaround”) and claims that the bank was embarking on a major recruitment drive, with plans to bring in another 40 managing directors.</p> <p>His colleagues were less than bullish, with some telling the FT's Owen Walker that if prospects don't improve this year they will be forced to draw up plans for job cuts and hiring freezes, especially in the stricken investment bank.</p> <p>Less than a day later, Credit Suisse issued its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83206826-ba9f-48df-af4e-f590ef2de683\">third profit warning</a> of the year, cautioning that tumbling revenues in its investment bank would result in a fourth quarterly loss for the group in 18 months.</p> <p>The results were met by a 5 per cent fall in shares, taking its stock to a 30-year low.&#xa0;</p> <p>That drop, however, reversed later on Wednesday after <a href=\"https://insideparadeplatz.ch/2022/06/08/state-street-will-offenbar-cs-uebernehmen/\">a single-sourced story</a> appeared in Switzerland's ultra-gossipy finance blog, <strong>Inside Paradeplatz</strong>, claiming that US custodian bank <strong>State Street</strong> was preparing a bid for Credit Suisse.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cue hours of reporters and traders trying to get a clear statement from State Street, which produced barely more than a no comment, sending its shares lower.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rumour raises an interesting prospect. Some top bankers think that there is much that can be salvaged from a better managed Credit Suisse. In particular, its asset management arm could be of interest to the big banks and other money managers who are looking to bulk up assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>But a deal for all of Credit Suisse is harder to envisage. That means the bank's leadership will need to focus on execution, better management and a multiyear rebuilding effort to win back trust.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Spac-tacular failure</h2> <p>We've talked before about how essentially everyone benefits from Spacs, except for the investors.&#xa0;</p> <p>The focus has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b481c63-f9b4-4226-a639-238f9fae4dfc\">typically been on sponsors</a>, the term used for the people who launch the Spac.</p> <p>Remember they get 20 per cent of the listed company for a nominal sum so if things go well, which they did during the height of the Spac boom, that turns into millions of dollars. If they don't, sponsors can actually end up losing money.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>But things don't have to go well for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a560343-69eb-4e36-9833-cc579a7dc8a\">investment banks to rake in lucrative fees</a> on Spac listings and deals. In fact, a company can fail and advisers can still walk away with their pockets full.&#xa0;</p> <p>The top-five Spac underwriters, including <strong>Citigroup</strong>, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and Credit Suisse, made roughly $1.7bn from listings in 2020 and in 2021, according to data from the <strong>London Stock Exchange Group</strong>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, many of the companies that listed through Spacs have seen their shares slide. It isn't the best environment for high-growth, zero-revenue businesses that are running out of cash — and investors have largely turned their attention elsewhere.&#xa0;</p> <p>As have the very banks who only months ago were only too happy to keep churning out new Spacs.&#xa0;</p> <p>The change of heart has been brought about by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, which in March proposed that banks underwriting and advising on deals would potentially be liable for misstatements related to blank-cheque companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>Goldman, which last year ranked as the market's second-largest underwriter, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34d28d11-118f-41a1-9bc0-3ab9412d9b9f\">has paused new Spac offerings</a> and is no longer working with many of those it helped take public. Citi and Bank of America are also taking a more cautious approach.&#xa0;</p> <p>What does this all mean for the Spac market? It was already teetering on the edge but according to one banker Spacs are “dead”.&#xa0;</p> <p>That might be a slight exaggeration. Banks that dominated the market before the 2020 boom, such as <strong>Cantor Fitzgerald</strong> and Credit Suisse, will be sticking with it. But it definitely isn't going to be anywhere near as active as it was in 2020 and 2021.&#xa0;</p> <p>Several people who spoke to the FT said Spacs will probably revert to being a product that lurks in the backwaters of finance. Everything comes full circle.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Greensill Capital's local difficulties</h2> <p><strong>Greensill Capital</strong>'<strong>s</strong> collapse last year snowballed into a financial and political scandal that tarnished the reputations of luminaries including former British prime minister <strong>David Cameron.</strong></p> <p>The saga spanned Australia, where founder <strong>Lex Greensill</strong> used to run a watermelon farm; Switzerland, where Credit Suisse investors funded Greensill; and Japan, where <strong>SoftBank </strong>bought into Greensill at a racy valuation.</p> <p>But it has also reverberated around a small village in the north of England.</p> <p>Chester-based <strong>Special Needs Group</strong> is owned by local businessman <strong>Barnabas Borbely</strong>, who lives around the corner from Lex Greensill in the Cheshire village of Saughall.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\">FT revealed</a> that Greensill had provided this very local business with a £5mn emergency coronavirus loan, which benefited from a guarantee from the UK government.</p> <p>Now, Special Needs Group has collapsed into administration, with Greensill Capital set to recover less than a quarter of the money it lent to the business. And, in contrast to some of Greensill's other Covid loans, the British taxpayer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d37fca1-2fed-443f-83ff-1bef446d3140\">could still be on the hook</a>, as revealed by DD's Robert Smith.</p> <p>Last year, the state-owned <strong>British Business Bank</strong> suspended government guarantees on £400mn of loans Greensill advanced under a separate Covid-19 lending scheme for large companies. Yet the backstop is still in place for a series of loans the finance firm made to smaller businesses such as Special Needs Group.</p> <p>The British Business Bank told the FT, however, that it has now launched a fresh investigation into these smaller loans too, which could lead to “the removal of the guarantee” if Greensill is found to have breached the terms of the scheme.</p> <p>While the outcome of the investigation is uncertain, DD is pretty sure that the whole affair will still make for some awkward conversations in the Saughall village pub.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has hired <strong>Lazard </strong>banker <strong>Jim Rossman </strong>as its global head of shareholder advisory, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-08/barclays-said-to-tap-lazard-s-rossman-for-shareholder-advisory?sref=fLR6XBbO\">reports</a>. Rossman, who begins his new role at the end of the year, has been at Lazard for more than two decades and co-leads its capital markets advisory business.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, the senior <strong>Amazon</strong> executive who announced he would leave the company last week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcf71482-8a24-4e91-b9d6-090b09a472cc\">is set to become</a> chief executive of <strong>Flexport</strong>, a logistics software start-up.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Michael Dobson</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/153b2ec1-0e5b-4159-91f5-29da7d071491\">will join</a> housebuilder<strong> Berkeley Group </strong>as chair in his first major role since stepping down as chief executive of Schroders this year. Dobson will replace <strong>Glyn Barker </strong>when he leaves in September.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Rakesh Mehta </strong>and<strong> Najeeb Ali </strong>have joined <strong>Centerview</strong> as partners in the San Francisco and New York offices, respectively. Both Mehta and Ali join from <strong>JPMorgan Chase's</strong> healthcare investment banking group.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Heather Miner</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fa-mag.com/news/goldman-loses-chief-saleswoman-at-asset-manager-to-buyout-firm-68239.html\">will join</a> buyout shop <strong>Advent International Corp. </strong>as chief operating officer and will be leaving <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>where she previously ran operations for the asset management division, Bloomberg reports.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Space junk </strong>Companies such as Amazon, SpaceX and OneWeb have plans to build mega constellations that will provide high-speed internet access across the globe.
