  "title": "The slow-motion succession battle at JPMorgan",
  "text": "<p>Jamie Dimon was once touted as a potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/859c0222-783a-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691\">US presidential candidate</a>. When the long-serving JPMorgan Chase chief executive decided against a run for the White House in 2020, one turn-off might have been the two-term limit.</p> <p>This week JPMorgan set the stage for a slow-motion battle to succeed Dimon, who has held the top job since 2005, by announcing the retirement of one of his top lieutenants and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e31d7a7-4911-493b-919d-31e04d756438\">the elevation</a> of Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak to run the bank's vast consumer business.</p> <p>Analysts interpreted the moves as a sign that JPMorgan could be set to appoint the first female chief executive in its history. But few inside the bank expect the popular and outspoken 65-year-old Dimon to relinquish his role any time soon.</p> <p>The JPMorgan board had told Dimon it would like him to stay on for a “significant number of additional years”, the bank said. Internally, JPMorgan executives have been told this means another five to seven years, according to a person briefed on the matter.&#xa0;</p> <p>That would extend the reign of Dimon, who underwent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55538a00-5f3b-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98\">emergency heart surgery</a> last year, into a third decade — or what would be the start of a sixth presidential term. </p> <p>“The man has had a very long and serene tenure, aside from the London Whale,” said John Coffee, a law-school professor at Columbia University, referring to the 2012 scandal when JPMorgan lost $6.2bn by secretly betting with credit derivatives.</p> <p>“Everyone else who was around when he started is long gone.”</p> <p>While this week's changes atop JPMorgan do not herald the imminent departure of Dimon, they come at a time of a broader changing of the guard at the biggest US lenders, some of which have made more concerted efforts to usher in new leadership. </p> <p>Last autumn, Mike Corbat, Citigroup chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/029264f1-f9a6-44c4-aa3e-86c7d50e3b55\">announced</a> he would step down after eight years in charge, earlier than many had expected, and handed over to Scotland-born Jane Fraser. </p> <p>On Thursday, rival Morgan Stanley kicked off a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/248cbea8-6dbe-4c97-b194-e68dbe121d1f\">succession battle</a> when chief executive James Gorman made a series of leadership changes, most notably promoting two top deputies, Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein, to be co-presidents.</p> <p>One template for the eventual departure of Dimon, a throat cancer survivor, could be Disney's Bob Iger, who last year stepped down as chief executive while staying on as chair to manage the transition. That has been the practice in all recent chief executive successions at JPMorgan, including when Dimon took over from William Harrison, Jr.</p> <p>If either Piepszak or Lake were to clinch the top job, JPMorgan would become the second big Wall Street lender to be led by a woman following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/029264f1-f9a6-44c4-aa3e-86c7d50e3b55\">elevation</a> of Fraser at Citigroup. </p> <p>Gordon Smith, who is being replaced by Lake and Piepszak when he retires as consumer boss at the end of the year, said the pair had risen to the top of the bank because they were strong leaders. </p> <p>“The consumer business has over 120,000 people and they have the ability to balance the IQ and the EQ for that job,” Smith told the Financial Times.</p> <p>The two bankers have been with JPMorgan for more than two decades. Most recently, Lake has been in charge of JPMorgan's consumer lending business while Piepszak has been chief financial officer since 2019, when she replaced Lake.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lake has had external suitors. She held talks about taking the chief executive job at Wells Fargo in 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. The role eventually went to another JPMorgan veteran, Charles Scharf.</p> <p>Upon the retirement of Smith, JPMorgan's board sees investment banker Daniel Pinto, an Argentine, as the first executive in line to take over from Dimon in the short term should he be unable to fulfil his role in an emergency.&#xa0;He will become the bank's sole president and chief operating officer at the end of this year.</p> <p>Pinto, who has worked for the bank since 1983, deputised as chief executive alongside Smith last year when Dimon had his surgery. </p> <p>There are other internal contenders at JPMorgan, according to one person briefed on the matter. The lender's operating committee was expanded in September and two of those who joined — Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees security services, and Troy Rohrbaugh who leads the trading operation — are seen as rising stars.</p> <p>Mary Erdoes, in charge of JPMorgan's $3.4tn asset and wealth management division, is another high-profile contestant and has long been one of the bank's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4a46f0-3e2b-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca\">top-paid executives</a>, receiving more than $20m a year.</p> <p>The promotions for Pick and Saperstein at Morgan Stanley, along with two other top bank lieutenants, Jonathan Pruzan and Dan Simkowitz, sets up a four-way race to eventually take over from Gorman, an Australian who has led the bank since 2010.</p> <p>Pick and Saperstein respectively lead the institutional securities and wealth management divisions, two business units at Morgan Stanley that generate about 90 per cent of the bank's revenues.</p> <p>Some inside the bank refer to the group of contenders as the “four horsemen”, reflecting the all-male make-up of the shortlist.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gorman, 62, has told Morgan Stanley's board, that he is committed to staying on for at least three more years. However, he does not expect his tenure to extend beyond the next five, according to a person briefed on his plans.</p> <p>Directors at both JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have little reason to hurry out their incumbent chief executives. Dimon and Gorman have enjoyed longer and more successful tenures than their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be17ac83-2f6a-4a4c-859b-2eefabdb4e1b\">European peers</a>, who are struggling with negative rates and a succession of scandals.</p> <p>But in both cases, the two sexagenarians look set to extend their tenures at a time when the industry is facing new pressures from a younger generation of employees to move more quickly on environmental and sustainability issues, as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">clashing views</a> on how bankers should return to the office after the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Boards have to notice when a CEO is no longer prioritising what's important to the next generation of leaders. That's particularly important at the moment in financial services where there is a huge demographic shift,” said Nell Minow, a governance expert at ValueEdge Advisors.</p> <p>For Morgan Stanley, the lack of diversity among the current crop of contenders was conspicuous, Minow said. </p> <p>She added: “When you see a crop of potential candidates like that, you think: don't you get out much? What are you missing?”&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Stephen Morris in London 2021 'The slow-motion succession battle at JPMorgan' FT.com 21 May.
