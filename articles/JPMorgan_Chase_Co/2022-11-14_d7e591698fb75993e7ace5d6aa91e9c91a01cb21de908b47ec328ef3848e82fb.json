  "title": "Investors Cheer Beijing's Plan to Support China's Housing Market, but Challenges Remain; Developers' stocks surge and bonds rebound from deeply distressed levels",
  "text": "<p>Prices of dollar bonds of developers that haven't defaulted on their debt—including Agile Group Holdings Ltd. and Longfor Group Holdings Ltd.—also rose sharply from deeply distressed levels.</p><p>\"China's housing rescue is finally here,\" China economists Wei Yao and Michelle Lam from French bank Société Générale Group said in a report on Monday. They added, however, that Beijing's plan \"should be viewed as temporary pain relief, rather than a stimulus that could trigger another sustained upswing.\"</p><p>The large market-price gains contrasted with debt investors' extreme pessimism less than a month ago, when dollar bonds from some developers were being quoted at below 10 cents on the dollar, indicating high expectations of more defaults.</p><p>The rally was sparked by China's move to dial back its real-estate crackdown late last week, when the country's central bank and banking regulator issued a wide-ranging series of measures aimed at supporting the troubled property market. The new policies were signed off on by China's leader, Xi Jinping, The Wall Street Journal reported. Economists and market strategists said they signaled an important shift in tone from crackdown to support.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.7% on Monday, adding to last Friday's big gains that followed China's easing on some of its stringent Covid-19 rules. The benchmark, which is heavily weighted with Chinese stocks, has now risen 21% from its previous trough on Oct. 31.</p><p>In Australia, shares of mining giants BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto Ltd. also gained on hopes of a recovery in demand from China for raw materials used in building construction.</p><p>BHP—a top 3 producer of iron ore globally and the world's largest exporter of metallurgical coal in a joint venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.—closed 4.6% higher in Sydney. Rio Tinto rose 3.3%, while rivals including Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. and South32 Ltd. also rallied.</p><p>China's property sector accounts for roughly 30% of the country's steel demand and between 20% and 30% of its demand for aluminum, zinc and copper, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar. Still, it is hard to tell how quickly the property sector may recover, given the significant erosion in home-buyer and creditor confidence, he said.</p><p>The new policies, which represent Beijing's biggest step yet to rescue the housing market from a downward spiral, included encouraging banks to step up lending to the sector and offer financing to help stronger developers acquire projects from weaker ones. It also allowed developers to extend loans and bonds due in the next six months by a year.</p><p>Importantly, the policies also emphasized that private-sector developers should be treated the same way as those owned by the state.</p><p>The 16-measure plan follows other support to the property sector. On Tuesday last week, China's interbank regulator restarted a funding program to support yuan-denominated bond issuance by private companies, including developers. The next day, Longfor secured approval to issue up to the equivalent of roughly $2.8 billion in bonds in the domestic market.</p><p>While the markets have reacted enthusiastically to the new policies, some economists said the measures, while an important policy pivot, don't represent a full reversal of China's earlier efforts to tame the property sector and appear targeted at engineering a soft landing.</p><p>The new measures may have \"little direct impact on stimulating home purchases,\" which is the bread and butter of rebooting the industry, said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. He said Beijing's mantra that \"houses are for living in and not for speculation\" hasn't changed.</p><p>\"Even after a recovery, new home sales could settle on a level significantly lower than prior to the pandemic,\" Mr. Lu said.</p><p>The new policies also lack measures to boost demand, said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ. Previous demand-side policies such as relaxing purchase limits and mortgage-rate cuts have largely failed to boost property sales, he added.</p><p>New residential home sales in China have remained sluggish in recent months. Sales in the first nine months of the year totaled the equivalent of $1.2 trillion, a 29% decline from a year earlier, according to data by China's National Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile, sales at China's 100 largest developers fell from a year earlier in October for a 16th straight month, according to industry data provider China Real Estate Information Corp.</p><p>While the package of new measures is \"by far the most all-round one\" since the liquidity crisis started in late 2021, it alone isn't a game changer, according to a note JPMorgan wrote to clients on Monday. This is because the policies address developers' funding problems but don't solve the core issue of weak property sales, analysts said. A more sustainable rally will depend on proof of sales recovery, they added.</p><p>—Rhiannon Hoyle contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com</p><p>Investors Cheer Beijing's Plan to Support China's Housing Market, but Challenges Remain</p>",
