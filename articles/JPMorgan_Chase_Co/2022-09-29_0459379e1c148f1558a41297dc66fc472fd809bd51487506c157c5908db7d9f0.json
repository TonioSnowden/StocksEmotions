  "title": "Tyson's Choice of CFO Raises Concerns About Potential Conflicts of Interest; The meat producer named the 32-year-old son of its chairman to the finance chief role. The Tyson family controls a large chunk of voting rights at the company",
  "text": "<p>Tyson Foods Inc.'s move to elevate the 32-year-old son of its board chairman to chief financial officer is in line with the company's history of putting members of the namesake founding family in positions of power. But corporate governance experts say the appointment raises particular concerns around potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>The Springdale, Ark.-based company––which is largely controlled by the Tyson family––on Tuesday said John R. Tyson, who currently serves as executive vice president of strategy and chief sustainability officer, will step into the CFO role on Oct. 2. He succeeds Stewart Glendinning, who was named CFO in 2017 and will remain with the company. Mr. Tyson joined the company in 2019 after working in investment banking at JPMorgan &amp; Chase Co.</p><p>While the company, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, hasn't run afoul of any securities regulations in its appointment, observers say it does raise questions about investor safeguards and board independence. Mr. Tyson's father, John H. Tyson, has been chairman since 1998 and served as chief executive from 2000 until 2006. The elder Mr. Tyson's aunt, Barbara Tyson, has been on the board since 1988.</p><p>The main issue facing the company's board is ensuring it can terminate the younger Mr. Tyson's role should he not perform, despite the father-son relationship, said Joseph Grundfest, a senior faculty member in the corporate governance center at Stanford University's law and business schools. \"The core question is whether he is competent to perform the CFO function,\" Mr. Grundfest said.</p><p>There is no conflict of interest, a spokesman for the company said of Mr. Tyson's appointment. Chief Executive Donnie King, together with a 13-person board of mostly independent directors, has oversight of the performance of the company's executives, including the CFO, the spokesman said. The company declined to make Mr. Tyson or other family members available for comment.</p><p>The company has two classes of stock, each with different voting rights on matters such as elections of directors. Most investors are entitled to one vote per share, but the Tyson Limited Partnership––the entity that represents the family's holding––owns nearly all of the shares that come with 10 votes for each share. The Tyson family had nearly 71% of total voting rights as of December 2021, according to a securities filing.</p><p>\"It is concerning [that] they appointed a 32-year-old with minimal financial experience, but that is the risk that minority shareholders take on when they purchase shares of a family-owned company,\" said Rebecca Scheuneman, a senior equity analyst working for the research arm of financial-services firm Morningstar Inc.</p><p>Mr. Tyson will be the youngest CFO at a company in the S&amp;P 500 or Fortune 500 when he takes over, according to Crist Kolder Associates, an executive search firm. That title is currently held by Kaes Van't Hof, the CFO of Diamondback Energy Inc., who was 35 as of mid-April. The average age for CFOs at companies in the S&amp;P 500 and Fortune 500 is 53.1 years for males and 52 years for females, Crist Kolder said.</p><p>While at the company, the younger Mr. Tyson managed strategy, mergers and acquisitions and procurement, including commodity purchases, alongside sustainability and other issues. The incoming CFO will retain responsibilities for corporate development, strategy and sustainability, the company said. Mr. Tyson previously held roles in private equity, venture capital and investment banking, including at JP Morgan. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University and a master in business administration from Stanford University.</p><p>\"Naming your son CFO in a public company is rather unusual,\" said Charles Elson, founding director at the Weinberg Center for corporate governance at the University of Delaware. Such family relationships can compromise the independence of both parties, cause issues in cases of disagreements or weak performance, and raise questions around favoritism, Mr. Elson said. \"It introduces a personal angle that shouldn't be involved in professional relationships.\"</p><p>Still, Mr. Tyson's promotion is consistent with the company's practice of \"keeping it in the family\" and in line with other family-led businesses in which family members move into executive leadership roles at younger ages than is standard at other companies, said Cathy Logue, head of the financial officers practice at Stanton Chase, an executive search firm.</p><p>\"Whether or not he is ready for the top spot yet is still to be determined, but he will benefit from a strong leadership team around him, including Stewart Glendinning,\" Ms. Logue said. Current CFO Mr. Glendinning will remain with the company and become group president of prepared foods.</p><p>Other examples of close family relations at U.S. public companies include Carvana Co., the used-car retailer run by the Garcia family, mining company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and automotive retailer Sonic Automotive Inc.</p><p>Charlotte, N.C.-based Sonic Automotive is led by David Bruton Smith, the son of O. Bruton Smith, the founder of the company and its longtime chairman before his passing earlier this year. The younger Mr. Smith also sits on the board of the company together with his brothers, Marcus Smith and B. Scott Smith. The Smiths collectively control more than half of voting power at the company as of March, according to a securities filing. Sonic didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Celso Goncalves, meanwhile, is chief financial officer at Cleveland-based Cleveland-Cliffs and is also the son of the company's chairman and CEO, Lourenco Goncalves. The finance chief has a strong financial background and has overseen as CFO the company's capital structure and growth and executed M&amp;A transactions, a spokeswoman said of Celso Goncalves.</p><p>Ernie Garcia III in 2012 spun Tempe, Ariz.–based Carvana out of DriveTime Automotive Group Inc., a car dealership started in the 1990s by his father, Ernie Garcia II. Mr. Garcia II, while not an executive or director, owns around 85% of the company's voting shares together with his son, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2021. Carvana declined to comment.</p><p>Mark Maurer and Nina Trentmann contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Jennifer Williams-Alvarez at jennifer.williams-alvarez@wsj.com</p><p>Tyson's Choice of CFO Raises Concerns About Potential Conflicts of Interest</p>",
