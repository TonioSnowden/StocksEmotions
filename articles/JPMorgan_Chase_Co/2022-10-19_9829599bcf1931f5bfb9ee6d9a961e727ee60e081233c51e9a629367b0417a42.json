  "text": "<p>Dear reader,</p> <p>Greetings from São Paulo, Brazil. I'm here for family reasons, doing my London job in a distant timezone. But it's impossible not to rubberneck at the closing stages of Brazil's most acrimonious presidential election in decades — almost as distracting as the omnishambles unfurling back home in the UK. </p> <p>The divide between the two remaining candidates and their supporters is bitter and has turned violent. Both wear bulletproof vests for public appearances. They are as far apart as possible on the political spectrum.</p> <p>On the left is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — Lula, for short — a charismatic former union leader and already two-time president from 2003 to 2010. </p> <p>To his opponents, however, Lula is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27e8a949-c3c8-4298-99c1-8c56c31231b1\">symbol of state corruption</a>, the architect of not one but two giant vote-buying schemes in Congress who spent almost two years in prison — ruling him out of the 2018 election — before his conviction was quashed. </p> <p>Way over to the right is Jair Bolsonaro, in office since 2019. He is a former soldier and admirer of Brazil's military dictatorship, sometimes known as the “Tropical Trump”. To his supporters, he is the outsider, a champion of traditional values who speaks for ordinary Brazilians against leftwing wokery.</p> <p>The less sympathetic think he is a nasty piece of work who has bred division in society, brought disaster on the Amazon and trashed Brazil's reputation overseas.</p> <p>Their rivalry has split Brazil down the middle. In the election's first round on October 2, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva\">Lula</a> got 48 per cent of the vote to Bolsonaro's 43 per cent. It was closer than the polls predicted. The two go into a run-off on October 30. Lula is tipped to win but the momentum is with Bolsonaro. The president has threatened, if defeated, not to accept the result. </p> <p>The winner will take over a country on the up. Headline inflation has fallen below 8 per cent from a peak of 12.1 per cent in April thanks to a central bank that tightened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d7fa8a-47d9-4a4d-ade2-9472dca146b9\">early and aggressively</a>. The currency is one of the world's very few to have gained against the dollar this year, up more than 8 per cent. </p> <p>Meanwhile, MSCI's Brazil equity index is up more than 8 per cent in dollar terms. But Brazilian shares are still cheap, at less than 7 times forward earnings versus a 10-year average of 11 times. JPMorgan expects the economy to grow 2.6 per cent this year.</p> <p>The pick-up in the economy has helped Bolsonaro's prospects. Ironically, enduring hardship may hurt Lula's: some of the poorest say they <em>would</em> vote for him, if only they could afford the bus fare to the polling station.</p> <p>In some policy areas, the two are not far apart. Both have said they will lift the legal ceiling on public spending, raising fears of profligacy. Bolsonaro's team would try to link any such change to offsetting measures such as a reform of public bureaucracy. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/2fc407d7-c4d8-41f8-903c-5af26d12f09a\">Bolsonaro</a> would continue to pursue privatisation, possibly preparing the ground to sell control of the listed state oil company Petrobras, until recently a heresy bordering on treason. Lula would not do that. But both would continue concessions in infrastructure to private sector companies.</p> <p>Basic sanitation is one area in need: in a country of almost 220mn, an estimated 35mn people have no access to treated water, 85mn have no sewage collection and 118mn have no sewage treatment. Private companies such as Aegea, Iguá and BRK have become big concession holders over the past 15 years.</p> <p>Tax reform is acknowledged as essential but has defeated governments for decades. Lula's plan is wide-ranging, that of Bolsonaro is more piecemeal. Both would struggle to make significant change in a fractious, pork-barrel Congress.</p> <p>In other respects, though, the two are oceans apart. Bolsonaro has promoted an upswing of violence and destruction in the Amazon which Lula would certainly move to reverse. Brazil's vast agribusiness sector is predominantly pro-Bolsonaro but Lula would be their best bet, reducing the threat of export restrictions imposed by European and other markets. </p> <p>But the real divide runs deeper. Both candidates have their origins in the dictatorship that ended in 1985, Lula as a revolutionary, Bolsonaro as an enthusiast. The country is as divided today as it was then, between messy democracy that is hard to do and the easy certainty of the populist right.</p> <p>Enjoy the rest of your week,</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Wheatley</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em> </p><p>Source: Jonathan Wheatley in São Paulo 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: Brazil's election splits the country in two' FT.com 19 October.
