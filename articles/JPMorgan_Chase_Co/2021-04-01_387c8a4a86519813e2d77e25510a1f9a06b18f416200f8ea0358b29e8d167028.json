  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Archegos's Fall Is a Wake-Up Call  ---  Capital requirements pushed risk into darker corners of the financial system  ----  By Rochelle Toplensky and Telis Demos",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The big damage from Archegos's collapse seems to have been limited to Credit Suisse and Nomura. But that doesn't mean all is well in the financial system. </p><p>\n  As the dust settles on the fund's implosion, the impact is becoming clearer. Credit Suisse and Nomura were slow to sell shares, costing them dearly relative to early movers Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. The anticipated losses are enough to cause Credit Suisse and Nomura serious pain, but not to threaten their solvency. </p><p>\n  The Swiss bank had a core capital buffer of 12.9% at year-end. If the Archegos hit is $4 billion, that ratio could fall by roughly 1 percentage point to well below the 12.5% minimum targeted by the lender, according to brokerage Berenberg. Shareholders can expect a suspension of its share buyback program at the least. A more cautious approach to risk management could trim growth prospects for revenue and profit. </p><p>\n  On first reading, the story appears to offer a fairly clear endorsement of tighter banking regulation since the 2008 banking crisis, which has probably saved Credit Suisse and Nomura from deeper harm. </p><p>\n  But there is a wrinkle: Some of the roots of the Archegos blowup can be traced back to postcrisis regulation. </p><p>\n  Tougher rules have pushed riskier activities into parts of the banking world where there is less oversight and far less disclosure. Archegos's family office structure, whereby it undertook to invest its own money rather than acting for clients, allowed it to keep its hedge-fund-like activities relatively private. </p><p>\n  Tighter rules have forced lenders to hold more capital, a heavy weight on profitability even as it protects them from collapse. Providing lucrative services to hedge funds is one way to boost their returns. Only a few lenders with big balance sheets can now afford to offer it, concentrating the risk in a few systemically important institutions. </p><p>\n  Low interest rates are another protagonist in this saga. They have pushed investors and lenders to take more risk in search of returns. Archegos was extremely leveraged: Initial reports suggest it had $30 billion of exposure backed by its $10 billion. </p><p>\n  Most measures suggest hedge-fund leverage overall is fairly high right now, albeit not at historical peaks. Leverage dropped sharply as the pandemic spread, though it has likely rebounded, according to the Federal Reserve's financial stability report. A proxy tracked by analysts at JPMorgan Chase shows levels now nearing their pre-2008 crisis high, but well below the early 2000s peak. </p><p>\n  Still, history shows that one messy unwind can easily spread. The U.S. Office of Financial Research finds that the 10 largest hedge funds were leveraged far more heavily than the next 40 largest funds, as of June. And many family offices may not be counted in these statistics at all, which mostly rely on disclosure forms they are able to avoid. </p><p>\n  There are some obvious responses for regulators, such as mandating disclosure of the total return swaps that allowed Archegos to build big positions out of the public eye. But there are no easy answers to the wider challenge of overseeing leverage within the broadest financial complex when debt is almost free. </p><p>\n  The system has held up under the latest strain, but this isn't a victory. Archegos means one who leads the way. Regulators must do what they can to ensure as few as possible follow. </p><p></p>",
