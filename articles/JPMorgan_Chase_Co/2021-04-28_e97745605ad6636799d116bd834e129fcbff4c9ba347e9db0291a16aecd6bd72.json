  "text": "<p>Mishcon de Reya is set to become the most highly valued law firm on the London stock market after partners voted in favour of taking the 83-year- old firm public later this year.</p> <p>The blue-chip firm said on Wednesday it had appointed JPMorgan to explore a possible listing as early as the fourth quarter, depending on market conditions. The firm could be valued at about £750m, according to two people familiar with the plans.</p> <p>The firm has a pugnacious reputation in litigation and defamation law, and also has large practices in real estate and employment. It also represented Diana, Princess of Wales, during her divorce in 1996 and recently acted on the UK Supreme Court challenge to the government's decision to prorogue parliament last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>The firm said that it wanted funds to accelerate its expansion overseas and to invest in growth opportunities in the technology sector, as well as to recruit more lawyers around its hubs in the UK and Asia.</p> <p>Partners voted to explore a listing at a meeting at the end of last week ahead of a board meeting on Monday, making it the latest legal services firm to do so. </p> <p>All employees will receive shares as part of the plans, in a move designed to foster loyalty among younger workers who would not normally receive a stake. </p> <p>The scheme will also include a salary sacrifice system for partners who take shares, and the firm will set up a super bonus pool over and above its existing one, comprising 5 per cent of Mishcon shares placed in a trust. A separate pool of shares will be set aside to fund the firm's social projects.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mishcon said that it expected revenues of about £188m for the 12 months to April 9 2021 and had had revenue growth of more than 40 per cent over the past five years.</p> <p>Mishcon said it would aim to float about 28 per cent of the company, leaving the majority of the firm in the hands of its partners and employees.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company has 178 partners, whose top echelon pocketed more than £1m each last year on average. It employs 1,000 people in offices in London and Singapore — a base it launched in 2020.&#xa0;</p> <p>Kevin Gold, executive chair at Mishcon, said that the listing decision had been driven by the need to “move the dial” on its growth, which would require a “huge amount more capital”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Law firms generally run with thin cash buffers and low levels of borrowing — unlike companies, they must ask partners to stump up cash for new investments. A listing would also allow the firm to “enfranchise” its staff — a “John Lewis” model, according to Gold.</p> <p>Mishcon will become one of a growing number of law firms to list on the public markets amid pressure to boost investment in technology and global expansion.&#xa0;</p> <p>Rival firm Irwin Mitchell is also considering a flotation this year. Other listed law firms include Manchester-based DWF, which has a market value of about £275m, Keystone Law, valued at £210m, and Knights Group, which is worth about £350m.&#xa0;</p> <p>RBG Holdings, which owns Rosenblatt, floated in 2018 on Aim and is valued at about £110m. Its share price has more than doubled this year.</p> <p>Mishcon's listing comes as the firm comes under pressure to expand internationally, including into Asia and the Middle East and invest in technology and acquisitions.</p> <p>In the past five years, the firm has increased revenues from £130m to £188m, having boosted turnover by 6 per cent in the 12 months to April 2020. It has also developed a series of non-law consultancy businesses such as MDR Mayfair — a private family office service — and MDR Brand Management. The firm is also seeking to establish an e-sports gaming agency.</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas and Kate Beioley in London 2021 'Mishcon de Reya set for £750m London listing' FT.com 28 April.
