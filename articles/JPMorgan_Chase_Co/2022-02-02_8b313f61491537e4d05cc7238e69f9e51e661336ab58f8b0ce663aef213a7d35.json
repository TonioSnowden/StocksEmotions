  "title": "PayPal Shares Tumble Premarket After Disappointing Outlook; Payments giant cited effect of inflation on personal spending in tempering its growth outlook for the year",
  "text": "<p>In a call with analysts, John Rainey, the company's chief financial officer, said that the Omicron variant of Covid-19, inflationary pressures and lack of additional government stimulus packages have weighed on spending and PayPal's business. He noted that the impact has been greatest on lower-income customers and has continued into the first quarter.</p><p>\"The persistence of inflationary effects on personal consumption, labor shortages, supply chain issues and weaker consumer sentiment have led us to adopt a more cautious outlook,\" Mr. Rainey told analysts.</p><p>If sustained, the 17% drop would be PayPal's biggest single-day fall since it was listed in its current form in 2015, according to FactSet. PayPal shares fell 15.8% on March 16, 2020, during the height of the pandemic selloff.</p><p>It is the second quarter in a row that PayPal has disappointed investors. In November, shares fell 10% after it reduced its forecast for online payment volumes and revenue.</p><p>Jefferies analyst Trevor Williams wrote in a note that the company's outlook for the next fiscal year \"lacks anything redeeming.\"</p><p>Shares in the payments company soared during the pandemic as commerce turned online, sending PayPal's valuation higher than all U.S. banks except JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>The share price peaked in July 2021 and then tumbled later in the year after news leaked that the company was in talks to buy social-media platform Pinterest Inc. The company abandoned its Pinterest pursuit under shareholder pressure.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>PayPal Shares Tumble Premarket After Disappointing Outlook</p>",
