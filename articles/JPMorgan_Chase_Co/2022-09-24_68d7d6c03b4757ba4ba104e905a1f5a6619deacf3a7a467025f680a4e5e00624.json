  "title": "Stocks Slump as Economies Reel --- Dow closes at 2022 low and oil prices plunge as new readings warn of global slowdowns",
  "text": "<p>Treasury yields rose again to their highest level in more than a decade, with the 2-year yield climbing to 4.212%. U.S. benchmark crude futures closed at $78.74, down about 36% from its June peak.</p><p>Behind the shaky markets are surging inflation, a robust central-bank response, anxious investors and the impact of Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The U.S. economy has largely escaped the worst of these ills, but a rising dollar is punishing the rest of the world at a time when price increases in many places are already outpacing incomes.</p><p>Economic activity in Europe declined sharply in September, data showed Friday, raising the risk of recession as governments grapple with war-related disruptions. In the U.K., the pound declined to its lowest level since 1985 after the government proposed tax cuts in a bid to restart growth, intensifying inflation concerns. Japan's yen resumed on Friday its decline against the dollar, just a day after the country intervened to boost its value for the first time since 1998.</p><p>Around the world, trade volumes are sputtering and inflation is crushing household and business confidence. China's housing market is cracking, while Europe's energy crisis is hammering factory output. The market's disavowal of the U.K. tax-cut plan highlights the narrow options governments face as they try to rebalance in the face of soft growth and high inflation.</p><p>Central banks led by the Federal Reserve, just two years after dispensing massive stimulus, are prioritizing the fight against inflation, increasing interest rates at a pace not seen in decades. The result is a pronounced weakening in economic activity in many regions, amplified by market volatility that in some cases is returning to levels last seen in the financial crisis.</p><p>\"It's a bit of an experiment, how fast and hard you can [raise interest rates] without destroying the real economy,\" said Jens Magnusson, chief economist at SEB, a Sweden-based bank.</p><p>The signals that the end of an unusual economic cycle is at hand were being received loud and clear by bankers and economists. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut this week its 2022 year-end S&amp;P 500 target by 16% to 3600. Rates have \"shifted dramatically,\" Goldman's David Kostin said. As a result, the outlook for markets is \"unusually murky.\"</p><p>Bank of America said on Friday it expects U.S. real gross domestic product to fall 1% in the four quarters ending in the last quarter of 2023, and for the U.S. unemployment rate to rise to 5.6% in December 2023.</p><p>Those forecasts underscore a central riddle of this cycle: how bad will the economic news get, after record stimulus helped avert economic disaster during Covid-19?</p><p>For now, some supply bottlenecks are easing and unemployment remains low across advanced economies. Households in these countries have dipped into savings amassed during the pandemic, with their spending increasing by an annual rate of 2.4% in the six months through June, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Global employment also rose at more than twice its prepandemic pace during the period, the analysts said.</p><p>The U.S. so far is weathering high inflation, slowing economic output and the Ukraine impact better than some other parts of the world. Consumer spending and job growth remain robust and some manufacturers are shifting production from overseas, boosting investment.</p><p>Contracting U.S. business activity moderated in September, according to surveys of purchasing managers by data firm S&amp;P Global. Its U.S. composite purchasing managers index -- which measures activity in both the manufacturing and services sectors -- was 49.3 in September, an improvement on August's 44.6 reading.</p><p>Cooling U.S. inflation will likely require somewhat higher unemployment and a sustained period of slower growth, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday.</p><p>Still, the housing market, often a leading indicator of economic weakness, is softening as mortgage rates soar. Fed officials lowered on Wednesday their median expectations for economic growth from 1.7% to 0.2% this year.</p><p>In the eurozone, retail sales declined in recent weeks as consumer sentiment hit the lowest level since records began in 1985. The region's industrial output shrank by 2.4% in July from a year earlier as runaway energy costs strangled manufacturers. Deutsche Bank reckons the region's economy could shrink by 2.2% next year, led by a 3.5% contraction in Germany.</p><p>Germany's economy, the European Union's largest, is deteriorating at a rate not seen outside of the pandemic since the 2008 global financial crisis, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at data firm S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. The pullback in economic activity in the country, which is highly reliant on manufacturing and one of the most exposed in Europe to the gas crisis, was particularly dramatic, S&amp;P Global said.</p><p>\"A eurozone recession is on the cards as companies report worsening business conditions and intensifying price pressures linked to soaring energy costs,\" Mr. Williamson said.</p><p>Friday's surveys showed a deepening decline in German business activity in September, led by the service sector.</p><p>Adding to the mystery of what comes next in Europe: the increasingly dangerous geopolitics of the moment. President Vladimir Putin of Russia this week threatened nuclear strikes and ordered reservists to mobilize after his troops suffered stinging setbacks in Ukraine, suggesting Europe's most significant conflict since World War II could either drag on or escalate.</p><p>Across Asia, export growth is weakening in the region's major trading economies, a sign of declining demand for electronics as Western appetite for consumer goods fades.</p><p>\"There really are signs now that things are starting to turn,\" said Alex Holmes, senior Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Singapore.</p><p>Chinese export growth in August slowed to an annual 7.1%, versus 18% growth a month earlier. Exports to the EU grew by an annual 11.1% in August, about half the rate in July, data from China's customs authority showed.</p><p>\"The global economy is in the emergency room,\" said Jerome Haegeli, group chief economist at reinsurer Swiss Re and a former official at Switzerland's central bank. \"Anything like a soft landing is wishful thinking.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Hannah Miao, Harriet Torry and Chelsey Dulaney contributed to this article.</p>",
