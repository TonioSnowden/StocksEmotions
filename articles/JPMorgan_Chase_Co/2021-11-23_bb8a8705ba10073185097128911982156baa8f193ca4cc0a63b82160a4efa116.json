  "title": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Told to Boost Capital Buffers; Financial Stability Board, a global group of regulators, increases capital requirements for several large banks following a surge in lending during the pandemic",
  "text": "<p>The changes \"largely reflect the effects of changes in underlying activity of banks,\" the FSB said. Bank balance sheets swelled during the pandemic, a response to huge amounts of central bank stimulus and government spending. JPMorgan's total assets grew by more than a quarter to $3.39 trillion in 2020, from $2.69 trillion the year before.</p><p>The FSB updates its list of biggest banks annually. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, must increase its additional capital buffer to 2.5%, becoming the only global lender with a requirement of this size. The aim of the buffer is to ensure that the biggest banks have enough loss-absorbing capacity for an orderly resolution if the bank fails.</p><p>BNP Paribas must increase its additional capital buffer to 2%, joining Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC, which already have to meet this level.</p><p>Goldman and BNP Paribas declined to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Goldman Sachs must increase its additional capital buffer to 1.5%, joining lenders such as Bank of America Corp. and Barclays PLC, which already have to meet this requirement.</p><p>The FSB's secretariat is hosted by the Bank for International Settlements, a group owned by central banks around the world. After the rush of bank failures and bailouts in 2008 and 2009, regulators came together under the FSB to set minimum uniform standards for bank capital.</p><p>The FSB's decisions on additional capital requirements come in the form of recommendations, which national regulators have vowed to follow.</p><p>Write to Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Told to Boost Capital Buffers</p>",
