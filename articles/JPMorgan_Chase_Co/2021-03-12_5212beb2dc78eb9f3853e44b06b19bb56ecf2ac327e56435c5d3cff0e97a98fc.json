  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Boxed-up soggy noodles and grocery deliveries face stiff tests as restaurants and non-essential shops start to reopen across the globe. Home deliveries of food and other distractions helped make lockdown bearable. But, as of this month, Americans can buy their iPhones in an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/apple-stores-in-us-open-for-first-time-since-last-march.html\">actual Apple shop</a>; next month, all being well, Britons can follow suit. So lossmaking delivery companies Deliveroo and Coupang appear to have timed their public offerings on — respectively — the London and New York stock markets rather poorly. </p> <p>No matter. Coupang, like America's DoorDash before it, went down a treat with investors who accorded it an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4d7ab5b-76e9-4015-bc0f-4c91c3d28a03\">$84bn valuation</a> on its Thursday debut. Coupang's bankers had pitched the South Korean ecommerce group as Amazon but Lex was more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1e4c304-9a50-431d-b0ff-0d3ffe9b3fad\">struck by the differences</a> between the duo. </p> <p>Amazon turned free cash flow positive within eight years of listing; at a decade-plus Coupang is still reliant on external investment: negative free cash flow of $182.5m last year puts it at the mercy of capital markets. Its share of the (far smaller) South Korean market, at 25 per cent, is half that of Amazon's in the far bigger US market.&#xa0;</p> <p>Deliveroo, targeting a valuation of $10bn, is a smaller morsel but private investors including founder William Shu will be hoping it slips down as easily. Lex, perturbed at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17dc510c-b396-4dc5-84a8-243a5bfa7825\">Deliveroo's inability to turn a profit</a> when sales were up more than a half, spots several flies in the soup. Gross profit margins are slim beside other industries and escalating competition stands to pare those further. Deliveroo, backed by Amazon, sees food as the frontier of a £1.2tn total addressable ecommerce market. That is a metric so preposterous, investors should flinch every time they see it.</p> <p>Another name that has inspired much flinching in recent weeks is Greensill Capital. Perversely, given its fall into administration, Greensill's factoring business model may be one worth keeping. Consider that companies of all sizes need constant, steady working capital finance. When these included such blue-chips as Vodafone and Airbus, said Lex, established lenders understandably <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9aa9560-6fb4-405a-922b-225ec259024d\">wanted in on the game</a> that Australian financier Lex Greensill started.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sure, it sounds unglamorous and margins are thin. This is a business of paying off invoices clients owe to their suppliers at a small discount in return for a spread on later repayment. Hence, Greensill's need for third-party financing of its own for its assembly line of deals. But there is something worth preserving if the likes of Apollo Global Management and JPMorgan are interested.</p> <p>Apollo's plan to scoop up pieces of the business may have been scuppered, but the alternative assets firm was still in full dealmaking mode last week. It hatched a merger with its listed life insurance affiliate, Athene Holding, that values the combined business at $29bn.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal confirmed that “some of the smartest investors in the world believe that underwriting debt with single-digit returns is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4f3bb5f-0a43-4a06-a80d-dc3c1d9b3d6d\">a challenge worthy of their time</a>”, said Lex. Athene's share price has stagnated, despite a book value per share that had been compounding by 16 per cent annually. The enlarged company, with better aligned incentives, should be a better bet.</p> <p>Lex shone a sceptical light on some of the world's funkier assets. Lithium, on a roll fuelled by electric vehicles, faces a more sober day of reckoning. “Going long on commodities, such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14198829-bb4c-45b4-bc2c-a4594d6b3b41\">market darling lithium</a>, means shorting ingenuity,” said Lex. Bulls should recall that runaway demand usually meets its match in clever miners and technologists — especially when the metal in question is overabundant on earth.&#xa0;</p> <p>The price of lithium carbonate in China has soared 126 per cent since the end of July to almost $13,000 per tonne. That may be only half of the five-year peak, but lithium's cost curve means that today almost every producer can make a cash profit at the spot price.&#xa0;</p> <p>From an antediluvian metal to a yet-to-be-created, gleaming non-metal one: digital euros. Here, the danger is drained funds: under an extreme scenario war-gamed by analysts at Mediobanca, wholesale adoption of European Central Bank-issued digital euros <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e8b36c5-4986-4394-bd05-81da1c36e5f6\">could force the ECB to wade in </a>and bolster banks.</p> <p>For now, the EU is still considering whether to press ahead with a digital currency, which it would be likely to restrict to retail payments. But if interest rates stayed negative or very low, digital euros held directly with the ECB could drain the deposit accounts that help fund lending.</p> <p>The concept sows fear among both citizens and central banks but rest assured, China is not so unique. If cryptocurrencies show any signs of supplanting fiat money, you can be sure that central bank digital currencies will be widely touted as an alternative.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend, whatever currency you plan on spending.</p> <p><strong>Louise Lucas</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1e4c304-9a50-431d-b0ff-0d3ffe9b3fad\">Coupang: comparisons with Amazon have been greatly exaggerated</a> <br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17dc510c-b396-4dc5-84a8-243a5bfa7825\">Deliveroo: taste test</a> <br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9aa9560-6fb4-405a-922b-225ec259024d\">Greensill/Apollo: acquisition would have been the sincerest flattery</a><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4f3bb5f-0a43-4a06-a80d-dc3c1d9b3d6d\">Apollo/Athene: big, fat Greek wedding</a><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14198829-bb4c-45b4-bc2c-a4594d6b3b41\">Lithium/electric vehicles: a necessity for batteries, not investors</a><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e8b36c5-4986-4394-bd05-81da1c36e5f6\">State digital currencies: defence of the realm</a></p><p>Source: Louise Lucas 2021 'Best of Lex: stock market deliveries and funky assets' FT.com 12 March.
