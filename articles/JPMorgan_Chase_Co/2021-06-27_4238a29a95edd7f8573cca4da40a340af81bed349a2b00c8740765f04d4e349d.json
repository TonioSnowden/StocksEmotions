  "text": "<p>Sajid Javid has overcome <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38a4a80c-29a0-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\">numerous hurdles</a> in a career that has taken him from “the most dangerous street in Britain” to the Treasury, but when he quit as chancellor last year his prospects looked bleak.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief adviser at the time, boasted at the weekend that he “tricked” the prime minister into ousting Javid, whom he regarded as “bog standard”. As far as Cummings was concerned, Javid would not be coming back.</p> <p>On Saturday, Javid was confirmed as the new health secretary when <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/178ca5e0-4336-4d20-987e-7ae8e849db54\">Matt Hancock resigned</a> after images of him kissing an adviser in his London office were passed to a tabloid newspaper.</p> <p>Javid's return to the cabinet — less than 18 months after he exited the Treasury — marks a symbolic closure of the infighting in Number 10 associated with Cummings, who was himself ejected from Downing Street by Johnson last November.</p> <p>It also puts Javid, a friend of the prime minister's wife Carrie, back in the running as a potential eventual successor to Johnson, providing a cabinet counterweight to the ascendant Rishi Sunak, who succeeded Javid as chancellor in February 2020. </p> <p>“Boris and Carrie wanted him back to help counter Rishi,” said one well-connected Conservative party official. Among the senior figures at Johnson's cabinet table, Javid — a former home secretary, business secretary and chancellor — is a serious player.</p> <p>That is not how Cummings sees it, of course. The former adviser tweeted: “Saj = bog standard = chasing headlines + failing = awful for NHS.” The fact that Cummings was locked in a Number 10 power struggle with Carrie Johnson, a former adviser to Javid, fuelled the row.</p> <p>It was Cummings who urged Johnson to sack all of Javid's Treasury special advisers last year and to bring the chancellor under his sway through the creation of a new economics unit straddling 10 and 11 Downing Street. </p> <p>Javid resigned, saying the move would limit his ability to “speak truth to power” and Cummings rejoiced that he had hoodwinked Johnson into a confrontation with only one likely outcome. But senior Tories said Johnson immediately regretted Javid's departure and the two men remained close.</p> <p>Cummings' departure cleared the way for Javid's return, but in the meantime the former Deutsche Bank executive used his time as a Tory backbencher to top up his already substantial bank balance.</p> <p>The House of Commons register of MPs' interests showed Javid earned £150,000 a year advising JPMorgan and a further £151,835 plus share options working for C3 AI, a Californian software provider. </p> <p>The 51-year-old son of a Pakistani bus driver, Javid grew up on Bristol's Stapleton Road — once dubbed Britain's most dangerous thoroughfare by a newspaper — and ignored the careers advice dispensed at his comprehensive school to become a television repair man.</p> <p>After enrolling himself at a sixth-form college he succeeded in his A-levels, attended Exeter university and went on to catch the eye of Chase Manhattan, which offered him his first job.</p> <p>By the age of 25 he was a vice-president of the US bank, but was then poached to work in the emerging markets team at Deutsche. By the time he became an MP in 2010 he was earning about £3m a year.</p> <p>A young disciple of Margaret Thatcher, Javid's friends say he has made the “journey” familiar to many Conservative ministers: from small state free marketeer to an advocate of government intervention in some areas, even if his instincts remain on the right of the party.</p> <p>Cabinet colleagues like Javid but some say that his record as a minister is not exactly memorable, and that his 2019 bid for the Tory leadership — when he finished in fourth place — revealed political frailties.</p> <p>The new health secretary is no fan of Covid-19 lockdowns: Javid's first utterance in his new job was to promise to lift restrictions in England <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/749e3731-b702-4f1f-8d18-1408fbd8e3d7\">“as soon as possible”</a>.</p> <p>He will now be plunged into a fierce battle with Sunak over funding for social care reform in England and to clear the 5m-strong NHS waiting list for treatment in the country. </p> <p>Javid's allies say that in all but one of the departments he worked in before the Treasury — culture, business, local government and the Home Office — he secured larger budgets. The exception was business, where ministers were told to cut spending.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents healthcare organisations, said sector leaders would be “encouraged that the role of health secretary has gone to someone who should know the Treasury inside out”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, told the BBC that Javid recognised the crisis in social care from his time as local government secretary, when he agreed to a “sticking plaster” surcharge on council tax bills to help with funding.</p> <p>Johnson was working with Hancock to put pressure on Sunak to agree funding solutions on social care for implementation before the next general election, but the Treasury is baulking at the cost of protecting people from having to sell their homes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another imminent flashpoint will be pay. The government drew the ire of nurses and other healthcare staff this year when its submission to an independent pay review body proposed a below-inflation 1 per cent rise. Ministers must make a decision in the summer when the body has reported.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sunak has long regarded Javid as a mentor, and now their relationship is about to be tested.</p> <p>“Sajid will fight for what he thinks the NHS needs,” said one close colleague of Javid. “He's a tough negotiator. He doesn't fold. The NHS has always been the Treasury's nemesis: it will be fascinating to see who wins.”</p><p>Source: George Parker and Sarah Neville in London 2021 'Javid shows political longevity with return to cabinet' FT.com 27 June.
