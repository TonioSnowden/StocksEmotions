  "text": "<p>US government debt rallied on Thursday after data showing the American economy shrank in the second quarter prompted traders to trim expectations for Federal Reserve rate increases. </p> <p>The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to monetary policy expectations, dipped 0.12 percentage points to 2.88 per cent as the debt jumped in price. </p> <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves with growth and inflation expectations, reached its lowest level since April following the report, and was trading down 0.11 percentage points to 2.68 per cent at the end of the day. </p> <p>The fall in yields came after a report from the commerce department showed the world's biggest economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e4caa59-5799-430b-9896-e494369900dc\">contracted </a>at a 0.9 per cent annualised rate in the second quarter of this year, worse than expectations for a 0.5 per cent rise. </p> <p>Gross domestic product declined at a 1.6 per cent rate in the first three months of the year. </p> <p>Two straight months of contraction meets the technical definition of a recession, although a separate body, the National Bureau of Economic Research, will not weigh in until much later to determine if the economic cycle officially turned at the start of this year. </p> <p>The White House and the Fed have said they do not believe the US is currently in a recession, a claim backed up by the continued strength of the labour market, where the unemployment rate remains at the historically low level of 3.6 per cent. </p> <p>While the headline GDP figure dropped, personal consumption, which offers insight into the strength of the US consumer, grew by 1 per cent in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the first. </p> <p>“What the report showed was that consumers were still spending, businesses were still hiring, so we don't believe the economy is in a recession, though it is downshifting as the Fed rapidly tightens policy,” said Lydia Boussour, the lead US economist at Oxford Economics. <br><br>US equities rose, extending gains that began on Wednesday after the Fed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fd352f9-7dae-42ed-af3a-8d53905e0acb\">lifted its main interest rate</a> by 0.75 percentage points for the second straight month. Stocks rallied as markets focused on comments from chair Jay Powell, who said the central bank was open to the possibility of smaller increases in the future. </p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 ended the day up 1.2 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1 per cent after earlier losses.</p> <p>“At some point, it will be appropriate to slow down . . . We might do another unusually large increase [in September], but that's not a decision that we've made at all. We're going to be guided by the data,” Powell said.</p> <p>Traders and strategists said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/997d7d73-ec13-4d2c-9f88-910430789380\">Powell's suggestion that monetary policy decisions</a> would be data-dependent indicated a lower probability of large rate rises going forward.</p> <p>“This does imply less dramatic increases in the next three [Fed] meetings than in the last two,” said Tai Hui, market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, adding that recent readings on “inflation and labour market dynamics . . . currently signal the need for a more cautious approach into next year”.</p> <p>The disappointing data on Thursday further pushed down expectations for Fed rate rises for the remainder of this year. Federal funds futures signalled the central bank's main interest rate would register an average of 3.26 per cent in December from estimates of 3.32 per cent a day earlier. Estimates had run as high as 3.69 per cent just two weeks ago before a string of weak data led market participants to expect a more dovish policy path from the central bank. </p><p>Source: Adam Samson and Naomi Rovnick in London, Kate Duguid in New York, and Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong 2022 'US government bonds rally after disappointing GDP data' FT.com 28 July.
