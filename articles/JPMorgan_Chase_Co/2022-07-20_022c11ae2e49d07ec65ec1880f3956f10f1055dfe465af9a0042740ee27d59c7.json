There he helped run a nightclub called Kaos, which had its fair share of run-ins with the Edmonton police. </p> <p>You'll find all the colourful details <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38fdc2e1-bd36-4da9-bbd7-bb33e3fcfab1\">in this report</a> by DD's Mark Vandevelde and Ortenca Aliaj. </p> <p>Shvartsman filed a lawsuit against the cops, claiming they were trying to put the club out of business by maliciously spreading false information about the venue. The lawsuit was dismissed without any finding being made as to the truth of the allegations made by the police. Shvartsman hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing. </p> <p>Prosecutors in the southern district of New York didn't respond to questions about the reasons for their interest in Rocket One.</p> <p>Garelick couldn't be reached for comment. A representative for Shvartsman didn't provide a comment on the Department of Justice subpoenas.</p> <p>Kaos folded in 1999 and Shvartsman later moved to Florida, where he has built an eclectic collection of business interests spanning payments, patio furniture and a recruitment platform for migrants. </p> <p>Among them is Rocket One. “What initially started as a family office has turned into a venture capital firm,” its website stated before it was removed in the hours after the subpoenas became public. </p> <p>Rocket One invested in DWAC alongside ordinary investors in the company's September IPO, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The company's shares increased from $10 to $94 after the Trump deal was announced, before falling back as potential legal obstacles to the transaction have grown.</p> <p>Now, DWAC says that an investigation by federal prosecutors could delay its deal with Trump's media group. It is unclear where that leaves the Trump venture's $1bn in expected proceeds, or the aspirations of investors such as Shvartsman. </p> <h1>French power politics</h1> <p><strong>EDF </strong>is close to ending 17 precarious years as a public company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41806d67-213b-4c0c-8ed5-21fb83f7a1e4\">with a €9.7bn offer</a> from the French government, which will bring the company under full state control. </p> <p>For some it has been a long time coming. </p> <p>The French power group's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d7225ad-dd3b-4b95-95a6-c270a0089277\">long-suffering shareholders</a> have seen its stock price shrivel by 60 per cent since its IPO in 2005. Its largest investor — the government, which holds an 84 per cent stake — has sometimes made contradicting demands on the company. </p> <p>As recently as January, the state forced EDF to pay for price caps it introduced to protect consumers from soaring electricity costs. The company lost a fifth of its market value as a result. </p> <p>While most of the market has reacted positively to the government's plans to nationalise EDF, some retail investors are crying foul and pushing back against a tender offer they say leaves them nursing losses at €12 a share. One association representing some EDF employee shareholders is attempting to sue. </p> <p>But this sort of opposition should be relatively easy to overcome if the government reaches a 90 per cent acceptance threshold once it launches the offer at the end of September. </p> <p>A potentially bigger hurdle to getting the buyout done quickly could come from another front, in a last brush with politics for EDF investors. President <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>'s government needs to get its budget for the nationalisation approved in parliament before moving ahead.</p> <p>There's also a possibility that large asset managers, such as hedge funds, could come in and push for a better deal. Others, though, aren't waiting around. </p> <h1>Twitter wins its opening salvo against Musk</h1> <p><strong>Elon</strong> <strong>Musk</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> will square off in a Delaware courtroom <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a400f5f3-fa3a-45af-8f79-6968157f7a4a\">in October</a> in what is primed to be the biggest deal battle in a generation.</p> <p>Chancellor<strong> Kathaleen McCormick</strong> of the <strong>Delaware Court of Chancery</strong> is expediting a trial in which Twitter is seeking to force Musk to complete his $44bn takeover of the social media company.</p> <p>Phalanxes of bankers, lawyers and public relations handlers will shuttle to the state, or take refuge in the <strong>Hotel Du Pont </strong>for a first-hand account. </p> <p>In asking for an expedited trial, Twitter had argued that the uncertainty over the takeover was harming its business. </p> <p>“It's attempted sabotage,” <strong>Bill</strong> <strong>Savitt</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dd25c98-c81d-42f7-a34d-308d1cff9909\">Twitter's lead lawyer</a> at <strong>Wachtell Lipton</strong>, said during Tuesday's hearing. “He is doing his best to run Twitter down . . . and he's doing that as a way to try to get out of the contract he promised to consummate.”</p> <p>Musk hoped to hold a trial in early 2023, after his lawyers investigated bot activity on the social network.</p> <p>His lawyer, <strong>Andrew Rossman</strong> at <strong>Quinn Emanuel</strong>, argued that analysing Twitter's bots required investigating billions of data points that could take many months.</p> <p>McCormick ultimately favoured Twitter's arguments. “The reality is that the delay threatens irreparable harm to the sellers,” she said.</p> <p>It is an early win for Twitter. </p> <p>“Twitter is trying to decide this now because they think moving quickly is to their advantage,” <strong>Eric</strong> <strong>Laumann</strong>, head of North American risk arbitrage research at <strong>Oscar</strong> <strong>Gruss</strong>, told DD. </p> <p>“Musk is at his weakest right now,” he said, noting that the mercurial billionaire now faces a time crunch in building his case.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has named <strong>J&amp;J </strong>former chief executive <strong>Alex Gorsky </strong>as director to its board. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Todd Leland</strong> has been named president of <strong>Goldman Sachs International</strong>, reporting to the&#xa0;unit's chief executive<strong> Richard Gnodde</strong>. Leland will relocate from Hong Kong to London where he was co-head of the bank in the Asia Pacific region. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Francesco Ciardi</strong> has joined investment firm <strong>Stonepeak</strong> as a London-based managing director.
