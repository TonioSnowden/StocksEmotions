  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 52 points, or 0.2%, at 36,381, after carving out an all-time intraday high at 36,565.73.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX added 4 points, or 0.1%, at 4,702, looking to add to a seven-session winning streak.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP held on to a gain of 39 points, or 0.3%, at 16,010. The tech-heavy index was aiming for an 11th straight session gain, which would mark its longest win streak since Dec. 26 of 2019.</p><p>The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT was trading 0.4% higher at 2,445.</p><p>Last week, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite each ended at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed for six of the last seven weeks and 16 of the last 18 trading sessions.</p><p>What's driving market?</p><p>Stock indexes built on gains scored Friday after the employment report showed job growth rebounded in October, and healthy quarterly results have helped to support the market's persistent advance, despite some lingering concerns about inflation and the Federal Reserve's policy shifts.</p><p>“We expect equities&#xa0;to continue to climb the ‘wall of worry', as risks look largely priced in and showing signs of improvement,” JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists, led by Marko Kolanovic and Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a note. “In our view, investors should buy the dip in cyclical assets, such as value, small caps, energy, financials and EM equities, commodities, and position for yields to resume moving higher.”</p><p>Market strategists credit the market's buoyancy to a seasonal trend of buying, with the November period starting a bullish stretch for equities and company stock repurchases.</p><p>Read: ‘It's a melt-up': U.S. stocks are on an unusually strong run heading into the holidays</p><p>“Driving the momentum is aggressive retail investor activity, accelerating stock repurchases and strong seasonality,” wrote Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research.</p><p>“As earnings season winds down, investor attention will focus on a fresh set of catalysts, including the passage of fiscal spending deals, accelerating economic activity and improved investor sentiment,” he wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials indicated on Monday that the central bank could raise U.S. interest rates by the end of 2022 based on the rapid recovery of the economy and an extended bout of high inflation. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida repeated his view that the criteria for a rate hike could be met before the end of 2022. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Fox Business that he foresees the central bank raising interest rates twice next year, and that a more rapid pace of interest-rate increases could be adopted if inflation runs hotter than expected.</p><p>The Fed officials' comments come after Friday's employment report showed the U.S. economy&#xa0;added 531,000 jobs in October, more than the 450,000 jobs that economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected to see.</p><p>The remarks also came after the Fed announced last Wednesday that it will begin to wind down&#xa0;its bond-buying program, as expected, which was designed to prop up the economy during the pandemic. Policy makers also indicated that the factors boosting inflation are expected to be transitory. Investors are closely watching for signs about the reappointment of Powell, whose term as Fed boss expires in 2022, following reports that President Joe Biden met with the chairman and Fed Gov. Lael Brainard&#xa0;at the White House on Thursday.</p><p>Meanwhile, the House of Representatives approved an infrastructure package late Friday, though a larger spending bill remains in doubt. Biden is expected to sign the bill, which includes $110 billion in funding for roads, bridges and major projects.</p><p>In corporate news, Elon Musk's Twitter poll came out in favor of him selling 10% of his stake in Tesla TSLA, sending the electric vehicle auto maker's stock down around 2.8% on Monday.</p><p>Need to Know: What makes Tesla worth $1,400 a share? Here's why Jefferies has the highest price target on Wall Street.</p><p>Musk, in a tweet, said he was prepared to accept either outcome. Musk has repeatedly questioned the value of Tesla, and his brother Kimbal sold 88,500 shares on Friday, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>PayPal PYPL is set to report its third-quarter results after the close of trade. Its shares were up 1.7%.</p><p>Elsewhere, Japanese investment group SoftBankJP:9984 reported a record loss due to its Chinese holdings as it disclosed it no longer had positions in companies including Amazon.com Inc.AMZN, Taiwan SemiconductorTSM and PayPal. Shares of SoftBank in Tokyo closed down 0.8%.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y yields 1.486%, up around three basis points since Friday.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.3%.</p><p>Oil futures&#xa0;rose, with the U.S. benchmark&#xa0;CL00&#xa0;CLZ22&#xa0;climbing 0.6% to $81.78 a barrel. Gold futures&#xa0;GC00&#xa0;rose 0.6% to settle at&#xa0;$1,828 an ounce.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600&#xa0;SXXP&#xa0;finished up by less than 0.1% to add to its record high.
