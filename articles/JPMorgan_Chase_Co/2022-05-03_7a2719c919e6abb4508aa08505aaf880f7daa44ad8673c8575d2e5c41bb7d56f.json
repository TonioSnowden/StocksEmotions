  "title": "Over 50% of workers say they would take a pay cut to avoid returning to the office full-time; A global survey of almost 33,000 workers shows that 64% of employees would look for a new job if their employer forced them to return to the office full-time",
  "text": "<p>And younger workers are the least interested in returning to work full-time, as this chart shows:</p><p>While many younger workers say they don't want to return to full-time office work, some experts have argued that they are \"losing out on a lot\" by not growing their career in an office setting. Last year, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said working remotely \"does not work\" for young people or \"those who want to hustle.\"</p><p>Additionally, over half of all respondents (52%) in this survey said they would consider taking a pay cut — up to 11% — if it meant they could ensure \"more flexibility or a hybrid approach to work location.\"</p><p>See also: More Americans are fretting over their finances compared to last year. Take one guess on what their main worry is?</p><p>The survey was conducted in November 2021 and sampled 32,924 workers in 17 countries including the U.S., India, Italy and China.</p><p>\"The pandemic signaled a paradigm shift as today's workers re-evaluate the presence of work in their lives, and the stakes have never been higher for employers,\" Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP wrote in the report. \"Our research highlights the extent to which employees' views of work changed, now prioritizing a wider and deeper range of factors that are more personal in nature. With recruitment and retention among the most business-critical issues, these revelations offer both a challenge and an opportunity for employers as they seek to keep workers engaged and fulfilled.\"</p><p>It's important to note that some resistance that workers have returning to the office full-time may also have to do with flexibility in terms of hours that comes from working at home, and less about the literal location of the work, as The Wall Street Journal noted in its latest story about workers' desire for flexible hours — 95% of workers say they want to maintain the flexible hours and work schedule they get from working at home.</p><p>See also: Why the NFL Draft is the sporting event where bettors beat sportsbooks</p><p>The survey comes as companies like Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL and Apple Inc. AAPL are urging workers to return to the office a few days a week. Other companies like Twitter Inc. TWTR and Facebook parent Meta FB Platforms Inc. have offered employees even more flexibility, and Airbnb Inc. ABNB recently told its employees they can now work from basically anywhere in the world without a pay cut.</p><p>Over 50% of workers say they would take a pay cut to avoid returning to the office full-time</p>",
