  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The business of global banking can get very complicated, but sometimes it is also pretty simple: A good economy will be good for banks. </p><p>\n  JPMorgan Chase's net interest income -- a basic measure of the interest the bank earns, less the interest it pays for funding -- was up 8% from a year earlier, the bank said in its first-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. That number should continue to rise as interest rates do, but for now the bank declined to update its earlier forecast for 2022 net interest income, excluding the more volatile trading unit's contribution, to be $53 billion-plus. </p><p>\n  A static forecast may be disappointing, given how much more aggressively the Federal Reserve is now anticipated to move. But it is likely to prove conservative. The bank's executives indicated on the call with analysts that the upside potential to that $53 billion is getting bigger, and said it would give additional guidance at an investor day next month. </p><p>\n  The bank's lending book also grew, though not as quickly as some might have hoped. Average loans were up 5% from a year ago. Excluding the runoff of Paycheck Protection Program lending, loan growth was 8% year-over-year. Anticipated credit-card loan growth was delayed a few weeks by the effects of the Omicron variant on consumers, but started to filter through in March, the bank said. Consumer home loans declined, thanks to a drop in originations as mortgage rates rose. Auto originations dropped because of a limited supply of vehicles, the bank said. Some curing of supply chains should help both home-purchase and auto volumes. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, fees were affected by a sharp drop in Wall Street investment-banking activity, as corporate decision makers awaited the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- but revenue from trading was actually down 3% versus a record quarter a year ago. </p><p>\n  This should put the first quarter's hit to net income, which was down 42% from a year earlier, in context. Many of the major levers were noncash adjustments. Significantly, the bank suffered from a comparison with results a year earlier, which featured a multibillion boost from the release of reserves. In the first quarter, the bank built reserves related to specific Russia exposures, as well as a slightly higher chance of a recession in the U.S. </p><p>\n  JPMorgan does face rising constraints from capital requirements set by regulators. The bank is now running at an 11.9% ratio of risk-weighted assets to common equity Tier 1 capital, down from 13.1% at the end of last year. </p><p>\n  Capital ratios can be quite arcane, but investors ignore them at their own peril, because they are meaningful when it comes to the bank's return on equity, which is itself a key driver of valuation. They can affect the bank's flexibility to buy back shares and expand its balance sheet with higher-yielding securities to boost interest income on its own. </p><p>\n  But some of those constraints can reverse as bonds mature, markets calm and more of the bank's core income flows through to the bottom line. So even with its hands somewhat tied, JPMorgan remains in a position to be a beneficiary of rising rates and expanding loan demand. </p><p>\n  The key question, then, is if an economic downturn is on the horizon in the U.S. That would make banks generally a bad bet. But barring that, the nearly 20% drop in JPMorgan's stock so far this year looks like a buying opportunity for those with some optimism about the economy. </p><p></p>",
