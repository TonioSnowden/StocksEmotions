That's a long way behind the largest deal in the US — a more than $130bn tie-up between <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>'s<strong> Warner Media</strong> and <strong>Discovery</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Vonovia</strong>, Germany's largest residential landlord, agreed to buy its rival <strong>Deutsche Wohnen</strong>,&#xa0;giving it control of almost €90bn of property.&#xa0;</p> <p>Tie-ups between two listed companies on Germany's benchmark Dax index are rare — among the most recent examples are <strong>Dresdner Bank</strong>'s ill-fated takeover by <strong>Allianz</strong> in 2001 and <strong>Bayer</strong>'s acquisition of pharmaceuticals group<strong> Schering </strong>in 2006.</p> <p>The transaction marks a coup for Vonovia's chief executive <strong>Rolf Buch</strong>, who has tried before to clinch Deutsche Wohnen. The serial dealmaker has shaped Vonovia into a European real estate behemoth through acquisitions such as Austria's <strong>Conwert Immobilien Invest</strong> in 2016 and Sweden's <strong>Hembla</strong> in 2019.&#xa0;</p> <p>Buch's last attempt to buy his rival fell apart in 2016 when Deutsche Wohnen shareholders, including <strong>MFS Investment Management</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f8d1c88-9389-11e5-bd82-c1fb87bef7af\">vehemently opposed</a> his hostile <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f433b04e-7243-11e5-a129-3fcc4f641d98\">€14bn bid</a> and the group's chief executive <strong>Michael Zahn</strong> declared it a low-ball offer.</p> <p>But after dodging Buch's advances for more than five years, Zahn has finally relented.&#xa0;</p> <p>Why now? As the FT's Olaf Storbeck <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OlafStorbeck/status/1397252659606917128\">explains</a>, there's political pressure building in Germany's capital Berlin over rent increases which has weakened Deutsche Wohnen's share price and made it a takeover target.&#xa0;</p> <p>Plus, a change in tax laws due to take effect in July will make it much harder to avoid paying more than €1bn in stamp duty on DW's property portfolio — which is one reason Vonovia is pushing for the deal now, insiders told Olaf.&#xa0;</p> <p>More than a quarter of the combined group's property will be in Berlin, where mayor<strong> Michael Müller </strong>has already given the tie-up his seal of approval.</p> <p>At €53.03 a share, Vonovia has offered a 25 per cent premium to Deutsche Wohnen's three-month undisturbed share price. Vonovia said the deal was expected to generate €105m in annual cost synergies.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's up from the €84m in estimated synergies the company promised during its hostile attempt in 2016 — a figure that Deutsche Wohnen dismissed at the time as implausibly high.</p> <p>As the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e57c04ba-c88a-4694-86b8-373c6393bf88\">Lex column highlights</a>, Vonovia's offer is almost exactly equal to Deutsche Wohnen's reported net asset value in the first quarter. The lack of a de facto premium suggests political concerns about listed landlords are still top of mind.</p> <h2>Foreign bankers shovel into China's wealth management gold rush&#xa0;</h2> <p>Last year geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington had reached a boiling point.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Wall Street hardly noticed, raking in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bba86de5-1da4-4b5a-bb40-6ff71c18cb7b\">bumper fees</a> from equity deals on Chinese companies despite shuttered borders and a trade war. <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>led the pack, pulling in revenues of $382m, a 220 per cent increase from 2019, Dealogic data showed.&#xa0;</p> <p>And now the US bank has found another lucrative path to profit in China — its wealth management business, as it joins the flock of other foreign lenders looking to capitalise on the nation's burgeoning middle class.</p> <p>Goldman has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/263c5b4a-8c29-485a-8b25-20f74c04ae7d\">won initial approval</a> from Chinese regulatory authorities for a wealth management joint venture with <strong>ICBC</strong>, one of China's largest banks, of which it will hold a 51 per cent stake.</p> <p>The US bank's relationship with ICBC began in January 2006, when Goldman invested $2.58bn in the then-insolvent state institution. Later that year the Chinese bank raised $19bn in what was then the world's largest initial public offering. Goldman sold the last of its stake <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff9bbc0a-c1cf-11e2-9767-00144feab7de?ftcamp=published_links%2Frss%2Fcompanies_financial-air\">in 2013</a> for almost three times the initial investment.</p> <p>But now it's back for more. Beijing has opened the door to what Goldman estimates could be more than $70tn in investable assets by 2030, as the government liberalises China's tightly controlled financial system.</p> <p><strong>BlackRock</strong> has also ventured to China through a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fd79007-e556-4f04-aa6e-43557652890f\">wealth management deal</a> with <strong>China Construction Bank</strong> and Singapore's state fund <strong>Temasek</strong>, following France's <strong>Amundi</strong>, which became the first foreign company to launch a majority foreign-owned wealth management business last year with <strong>Bank of China</strong>. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> is slated to be next.</p> <p>But nothing is ever as easy as it seems.&#xa0;</p> <p>And, by becoming majority owner of its wealth management venture, Goldman Sachs could be opening a Pandora's box of potential diplomatic issues.&#xa0;</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc4d6749-9abb-4b58-8ad6-7b81fc74d867\">criticism</a> levelled at <strong>HSBC </strong>boss <strong>Noel Quinn</strong> by UK politicians for the bank's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/213c0e2c-f1c7-4637-a0b9-4c3f72709d52\">openly support</a> the national security law China imposed on Hong Kong.</p> <p>The Wall Street firm could undoubtedly encounter its own set of headaches Stateside as the deal progresses.&#xa0;</p> <p>Its operations in Asia haven't always gone well. Remember <strong>1MDB</strong>? Goldman's Malaysian subsidiary was forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c570376-a02f-4550-8304-8e61943f9782\">plead guilty</a> to a bribery charge and pay a record $2.9bn settlement over the money-laundering scandal.</p> <h2>KKR's ‘watershed' in the hunt for infrastructure deals&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>KKR</strong> and <strong>John Laing</strong> have very different problems.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US private equity behemoth needs to put its deep pockets of capital to work, including in infrastructure deals, but these can be hard to find and pull off.</p> <p>Laing, the UK-listed developer whose projects include a tolled express lane in Washington, is better connected to the shovels in the ground. Yet it has limited capital to pay for them.</p> <p>It has to rely on flipping investments, using the proceeds from its sales to fund new developments.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's the context behind KKR's £2bn bid to take<strong> FTSE 250</strong>-listed John Laing private, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Gill Plimmer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/142011a0-d422-4ccd-b75e-8eb9345dc29d#comments-anchor\">report</a>.</p> <p>Laing will be able to apply to the New York group's funds for cash for new developments. And KKR could own the company for longer than usual, having bought it using a pot of cash it calls “perpetual”.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a bet on the growing political appetite for infrastructure spending to drag economies out of Covid-19 induced recessions.</p> <p>US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> has pledged $3tn of infrastructure spending over the next eight years, while UK prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has set aside £600bn over the next five.&#xa0;</p> <p>But governments can borrow cheaply, while private sector infrastructure operators must earn commercial rates of return — ultimately heaping costs on to the users of essential services.&#xa0;</p> <p>So, will politicians choose to bring in private capital? Perhaps not.&#xa0;</p> <p>The UK's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8165ec0-1d61-4208-95ad-bb5c9b212407\">High Speed 2 rail project</a> is government-funded and managed by a public body.</p> <p>Meanwhile, private equity lobbyists have described Biden's plan so far as a “fund-it-through-the-government” approach.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s global head of prime brokerage <strong>Ed Keller</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c7c8832-6411-46e2-8582-8043f03c5d96\">leaving his role</a>. The bank said it was not connected to the $911m hit suffered by the bank from the collapse of <strong>Archegos Capital</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Apollo Global Management </strong>has promoted senior partner <strong>Stephanie Drescher</strong> to chief client and product development officer. She will also oversee the asset manager's newly established wealth management unit.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has hired <strong>Lucy Demery </strong>as a managing director to cover fintech clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. She joins from <strong>Standard Chartered Bank</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Former global co-head of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' merchant banking unit<strong> Sumit Rajpal </strong>has launched<strong> GrowthCurve Capital</strong>, a new control-oriented private equity firm focused on technology.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Philippe Houssiau </strong>has joined the private equity firm <strong>Permira</strong> as a senior adviser focusing on healthcare. He has previously worked at <strong>HgCapital</strong> and <strong>PwC</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Deutsche's second wind </strong>The beleaguered German bank has spent more than a decade plagued by scandal but it could be on the path to recovery under chief executive Christian Sewing.
