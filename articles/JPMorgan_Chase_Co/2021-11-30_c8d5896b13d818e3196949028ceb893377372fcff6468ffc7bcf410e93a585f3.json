It is up by 3.3 basis points for the month.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Powell surprised financial markets by saying it's appropriate for policy makers to consider wrapping up the tapering of bond purchases by possibly a few months sooner than expected. His focus on the potential for an accelerated tapering timeline, given a “very strong” economy and “high” inflation pressures, caught investors off guard. Losses for U.S. stocks deepened after Powell spoke, while a widely followed part of the Treasury curve flattened even further as traders factored in the likelihood of rate hikes in the next two years, as well as a diminished longer-term economic outlook.Read:Traders raise expectations for accelerated rate hikes by Federal Reserve after Powell speaks, flattening Treasury curve even furtherTreasury yields turned mixed on Tuesday after having been broadly lower during the New York morning. Early in the day, investors sought safety in Treasurys across the board after Moderna Inc. MRNA Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel told the Financial Times that existing vaccines will likely be less effective against the omicron variant discovered late last week in southern Africa.</p><p>“I think it's going to be a material drop” in effectiveness, he said. “I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data.
