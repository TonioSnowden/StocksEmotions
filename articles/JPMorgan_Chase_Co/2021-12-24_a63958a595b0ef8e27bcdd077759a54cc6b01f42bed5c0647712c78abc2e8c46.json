Thanks for reading!</p> <h2>The death of the conglomerate</h2> <p><strong>General Electric</strong>'s decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb73e702-e885-4c20-8857-ddd29dc623af\">break into three companies</a> marked the end of its status as America's best-known industrial conglomerate after years of turmoil. </p> <p>For investment banks, to who GE has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa719574-b457-43fd-9c45-ae19a510c1cb\">paid more than $7bn</a> in fees since 2000 as it amassed its corporate empire, it signalled another payday.</p> <p>The split is expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2c421bd-0ad2-403b-a585-7b4f52a3abf7\">trigger a feeding frenzy</a> among buyout firms. “This is epochal,” one private equity partner told DD, calling GE's break-up the “death knell” of the conglomerate. </p> <p>With <strong>Toshiba</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f27efd7-5a85-4056-8d9a-da5fbbbc448f\">considering a split</a> into three, and <strong>IBM</strong> exiting its services business, it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ca38b2c-a9ce-4450-b156-a17a24e33976\">become clearer</a> that an era is over.</p> <p>Tech behemoths, and huge alternative asset managers such as <strong>Apollo</strong>, <strong>Blackstone</strong>, <strong>Brookfield</strong>, <strong>Carlyle</strong> and<strong> KKR</strong>, are more formidable than GE was at its peak . . . </p> <h2>. . . which brings us to our next theme: are private equity firms the new conglomerates?</h2> <p>The so-called barbarians at the gate now resemble the multibillion-dollar empires they once sought to dismantle.</p> <p>If KKR's sprawling assets were listed under one entity, its market capitalisation could soon exceed $100bn — in the league of corporate giants such as GE,<strong> Lockheed Martin</strong> or <strong>3M</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The sector's growing might was evidenced when once-struggling <strong>TPG</strong> announced plans for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65a6274c-e4c4-4c27-a44b-de9a86c7e49b\">the next private equity IPO</a>. </p> <p>Private equity executives are growing more influential, raking in pay that dwarfs their fellow corporate chieftains. Blackstone's <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong> made $610.5m in pay and dividends last year, while KKR's <strong>Henry Kravis</strong> and <strong>George Roberts</strong> received $80.6m and $84.5m, respectively.</p> <p>But the industry continues to avoid meaningful transparency. <strong>Bridgepoint</strong>, the UK buyout firm that listed this year, used a complex structure that enables top executives to receive carried interest worth several times their salary and bonus, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25649306-ac8a-4183-894a-7df1eb798acf?\">without telling shareholders</a> how much they are making. </p> <p>If private equity groups are no longer the disrupters, who is? </p> <h2>Spacs have tried to fill that void. But DD readers know it has been a bumpy ride</h2> <p>Wall Street was in a blank-cheque boom come Q1, fuelling dealmaking's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacdf86f-e786-4439-966e-f5958adb1c59\">strongest-ever start</a> to the year. But trouble was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88d7f577-9bfa-4215-b57b-0f8a4da3644a\">just around the corner</a>. </p> <p>The short seller<strong> Hindenburg Research</strong>, which went for electric truckmaker <strong>Nikola </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4fc81eb-ae24-4039-b535-0eb5d119dc84\">last year </a>(the consequences of which are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4cbb58-d41c-4487-a24a-8ac8ce088375\">still being felt</a>), took on blank-cheque companies from “King of Spacs” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bffc55cd-7120-4d0d-95d6-15cadfd2d6c5\"><strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong></a>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f913a5a-a6ef-436b-8b58-4a4804665e70\"><strong>Clover Health</strong></a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e3835cd-b445-4a26-b3ec-62ced12536f6\"><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb109961-731f-4b3c-ac6c-460b056f2a0a\"><strong>DraftKings</strong></a>.</p> <p>Wall Street's top regulator also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\">cooled things down</a>, raising concerns over rosy revenue projections and endorsements of the vehicles from celebrities<strong> Jennifer Lopez</strong> and<strong> Alex Rodriguez</strong>, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22dcc2fe-f902-40cb-88cb-bcd1cb5ebfa0\">turning up the heat</a> on <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s media venture.</p> <p>(The UK, falling ever more behind the US, is desperate to join the Spac party.)</p> <h2>On the subject of bad PR, Teneo had quite the year</h2> <p>“The world's pre-eminent CEO advisory firm” found itself handling a reputational crisis of its own when the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77203615-503e-4f6d-8011-1dbf99286140\">revealed</a> that its chief <strong>Declan Kelly</strong> had inappropriately touched a number of women without their consent at a charity event in May.</p> <p>The event <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f555d441-82eb-4215-8f09-a5496d339870\">triggered his resignation</a> just six months after the departure of Teneo's founding partner <strong>Doug Band</strong>, who left after he described his bitter break-up with the Clintons in a Vanity Fair <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/confessions-of-a-clintonworld-exile\">interview</a>.</p> <p>The firm, once <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7412f910-3043-466c-a3a8-74132713cf7d\">described</a> by a judge as “skilled in the darker arts of influencing the media and public discourse”, must use its gifts to try and rebuild its top ranks. But swift consolidation in the PR world, including <strong>Finsbury Glover Hering</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2e33a1c-4086-4810-a446-18ac15c12d69\">purchase</a> of US rival <strong>Sard Verbinnen</strong> in October, will make that challenge more difficult&#xa0;</p> <h2>Greensill and Gupta</h2> <p>The FT broke scoop after scoop on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\">everything Greensill</a>, one of the biggest political and financial scandals in years. We set the scene <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9741d707-1be2-4c15-a78f-aca1c5fb6781\">here</a>.</p> <p>The collapse of Australian financier<strong> Lex Greensill</strong>'s eponymous <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, which was backed by <strong>SoftBank</strong> and <strong>General Atlantic</strong>, was just the beginning.</p> <p>The fallout drew in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/338cf979-e19e-4b41-be6a-c59c32e9e3fb\"><strong>David Cameron</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca5f4d3-6ae1-46ce-8729-ce2f2d4ab9f7\">metals</a> magnate <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/542e84a5-caed-4b8e-bcd7-63051ae65ce1\"><strong>Credit Suisse</strong></a> and even Saudi Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong>. The UK's <strong>Serious Fraud Office</strong> opened an investigation into Gupta's metals empire and its financing arrangements with Greensill. </p> <h2>Another fine mess: Archegos sets its prime brokers ablaze</h2> <p>The implosion of <strong>Archegos</strong>, the obscure family office run by <strong>Tiger Global Management</strong> alumnus <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>, left its prime brokers in the biggest industry upheaval since the financial crisis.</p> <p>The firm had levered itself to high heaven before one of its bets went sour and the prime brokers who had done business with Hwang — nine to be precise — were forced to unwind his book and absorb more than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f18f39ec-1276-4fed-95e4-6aca6d684a7f\">$10bn in losses</a>.</p> <p>Nomura and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a6be4fc-5102-4bd2-9bf3-f27dd9957c6f\"><strong>Credit Suisse</strong></a> bore the brunt of the Archegos fallout, with <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> selling out quicker.</p> <p>Credit Suisse <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31905026-18bb-4fea-bcda-86ad22e13ae7\">all but exited</a> prime broking, setting the scene for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4e95d7e-5d44-43e8-9646-ae99d4b518c3\">new era</a> as <strong>BNP Paribas </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c269c1a-caeb-45d2-94cc-4986aeb95d19\">stepped in</a> to fill the void. Nomura ceased offering cash prime broking in Europe and the US.</p> <p>Hwang once said he loved seeing “what God is doing through investing and capitalism”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The fiasco has offered the market a lesson of biblical proportions. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Wall Street grapples with another crisis of faith in China</h2> <p>Even as geopolitical tensions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57174621-3863-42b0-a39a-a36801fd7481\">simmered</a> between Washington and Beijing, US banks were becoming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">increasingly enamoured</a> with China.</p> <p>Beijing has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfa56fcc-e345-4c17-b988-b1194b3d9ab5\">begun to open</a> its tightly controlled financial system to foreign bankers, unlocking what Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/263c5b4a-8c29-485a-8b25-20f74c04ae7d\">estimates</a> could be more than $70tn in investable assets by 2030.</p> <p>But shortly after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91f242f4-dee1-47d4-95b8-74832a0834fb\">Goldman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fd79007-e556-4f04-aa6e-43557652890f\"><strong>BlackRock</strong></a> and JPMorgan set off on the wealth management gold rush, storm clouds circled.</p> <p>This July, the government launched an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/095eb7ac-09ea-4a5c-8253-d8ca2d945614\">investigation</a> into New York-listed ride-hailing group <strong>Didi Chuxing</strong> and announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/299ba00b-dfef-4c53-88a2-e6725d14025d\">new measures</a> against Chinese groups listing in the US. Wall Street bankers quickly realised they wouldn't be raking in the same <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bba86de5-1da4-4b5a-bb40-6ff71c18cb7b\">record fees</a> from equity deals on Chinese companies. </p> <p>Throw in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f1adc7-d6d8-49c2-8ebd-3b686751b187\">collapsed $3bn property deal</a> between <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Soho China</strong>, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f1adc7-d6d8-49c2-8ebd-3b686751b187\">deepening liquidity crisis</a> at <strong>Evergrande</strong> and a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58db4b4b-ec3c-4b0b-9441-47ad2096a9dd\">diplomacy faux pas</a> from JPMorgan boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, and you've got the year in Wall Street-China relations that nobody asked for. </p> <h2>Remember the Super League?</h2> <p>Our colleagues at Scoreboard recount the tale <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1d7ea1e-eb54-4c4a-990b-afbd35a7dc36\">here</a>. It goes something like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfdbbb9-75e4-4374-8214-977a1ddfce68\"><strong>Florentino Pérez</strong></a> wanted to upend football's power dynamics — with backing from <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>. </p> <p>Just 48 hours after he made his move, the project unravelled amid mass public protest and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7291cf-1225-4127-8972-6e46cc3f1ce1\">political backlash</a>. All six English clubs pulled out, followed by <strong>Atlético Madrid</strong>, <strong>Inter Milan</strong> and <strong>AC Milan</strong>, with grovelling apologies all around. Even Jamie Dimon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc927efb-1b05-4f2c-947d-a3832bfe7b36\">apologised</a>.</p> <p>For many fans, the victory marked a win for the love of the game over a pack of greedy billionaires trying to turn football into a money machine.</p> <p>DD isn't convinced that the world's favourite sport can't be bought, though.</p> <p>Just ask <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>. The deep-pocketed buyout firm saw off objections from <strong>Real Madrid </strong>and <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> to ink a financing deal with <strong>La Liga</strong>.</p> <p>It was a crushing loss for the Spanish clubs, who had already tasted Super League defeat. </p> <p>Cold hard capitalism reared its head again in October, when Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6732197-ee8c-41d6-81a6-f3136e2f1fe1\">resurrected its £305m takeover</a> of <strong>Newcastle United Football Club</strong>. </p> <h2>What the **** is SoftBank?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb02efc1-6dab-468b-9691-296b8e35d4dd\">We still can't seem to pin down</a> the Japanese conglomerate led by billionaire dealmaker <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>. We <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/49e2f1ee-c923-47f7-ac6d-7f8e1747305b\">even made an FT Film</a> trying to piece it all together.</p> <p>It's hard to think of another business that has changed its identity as frequently as SoftBank has over the past five years. </p> <p>If you asked us a few years ago, it was a telecoms group benefiting from the stability of its core businesses to wager a bunch of aggressive side bets, such as its investment in <strong>Alibaba</strong>. Then it started to look more like a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4403ee1a-050f-4742-b967-ba47b0f1de03\">hedge fund</a>.</p> <p>SoftBank has spent the past year on an emotional rollercoaster. It went from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/975b6de6-faaa-4755-b78b-a0f90bc6f8da\">its best quarterly performance</a> to declaring it was caught “in the middle of a blizzard”, battling a series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/854bebb2-c9ed-488f-9931-63017f547c6e\">tech bets gone wrong</a>.</p> <p>A series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29b4d990-4770-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441\">high-profile departures</a> from its Vision Fund and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/107fe840-1874-4fb2-a70b-f2f8f1381215\">internal tensions</a> over Son's controversial dealmaking style haven't helped.</p> <p>SoftBank's aggressive investment tactics (which sometimes involved conducting minimal due diligence and paying inflated prices to get the jump on its rivals) have caught on nonetheless.</p> <p>Investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e6b7543-3000-45e5-aee8-e8ccc9b5f661\">ploughed funds</a> into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5207cc15-f06e-4d37-b38f-cb831fbc3d5a\">private start-ups</a> at an unprecedented pace this year, with&#xa0;<strong>Tiger Global Management </strong>leading the pack.</p> <h2>McKinsey's new year's resolution: stop the scandals</h2> <p>Management consultancy <strong>McKinsey</strong> once served as a portal to upper echelons of Washington, Wall Street and Silicon Valley — through which <strong>Sheryl Sandberg</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>'s <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s <strong>James Gorman</strong> have travelled.</p> <p>But the allure of McKinsey's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0\">signature “mystique”</a> has faded as it has struggled to swat off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d159f32c-d2f4-465f-8280-313ab78eaed4\">scandal after scandal</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8923cfde-8a29-4d40-a214-57f6620ac019\">Voting out</a> former global managing partner<strong> Kevin Sneader</strong> for his handling of the various crises in February was meant to signal a fresh chapter at the firm.</p> <p>Only, just last month, US prosecutors charged one of its partners with securities fraud for alleged insider trading and the firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd3b119a-3476-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812\">paid $15m</a> to the US Department of Justice to settle claims that it failed to disclose conflicts of interest in bankruptcy cases.</p> <p>McKinsey veteran <strong>Bob Sternfels </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0619e19-2696-4ed4-9538-7ce5c2b9357f\">has been elected</a> to usher in change.</p> <p>Whatever he's planning, it can't be worse than McKinsey's 2010s-era “Evolve 2 Excellence” initiative for <strong>Purdue Pharma</strong>, intended to “turbocharge” the company's sales of its highly addictive painkillers. </p><p>Source:  2021 'DD, wrapped: our top 10 stories of the year' FT.com 24 December.
