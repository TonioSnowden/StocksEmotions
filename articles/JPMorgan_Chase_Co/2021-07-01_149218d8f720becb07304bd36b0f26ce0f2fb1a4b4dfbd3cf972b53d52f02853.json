  "title": "Markets Review & Outlook: Second Quarter: Real-Estate Debt Returns --- Supply of single-asset, single-borrower bonds expected to double in 2021 with new offers",
  "text": "<p>That marks a significant recovery after issuance of so-called single-asset, single-borrower bonds ground to a halt last spring, when the Covid-19 pandemic emptied commercial real estate across the country. Single-asset, single-borrower deals dropped 42% to around $26 billion in 2020, according to data from Trepp.</p><p>Sold as gold-plated debt from trophy properties, such as the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach, Fla., the bonds have been prized by investors for their relatively high yields in an era of ultralow interest rates. Now they are increasingly a way for some to wager on the rebound's winners, as reopenings test the commercial real-estate market in the second half of the year.</p><p>With borrowing costs low -- the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was on pace Tuesday to end the quarter below 1.5% -- analysts expect more single-asset, single-borrower deals in the months ahead. Bank of America analysts said banks are planning to price two more single-asset deals worth more than $1 billion combined over the next few months. JPMorgan analysts estimate these types of deals will double this year, exceeding pre-Covid-19 levels.</p><p>Despite reopening and return-to-work plans, some warn that hotels and office spaces remain threatened. Bond buyers have been watching the Seagram Building -- once home to Wells Fargo &amp; Co., now nearly 40% vacant -- to gauge the direction of the real-estate market. The Midtown Manhattan skyscraper backs $1 billion of debt sliced in multiple loans that pay investors based on projected revenue and high occupancy rates.</p><p>\"Things are on the uptick,\" said Edward Weil, a Chicago-based attorney at Dykema. \"Hotels are opening, travel has rebounded, but we are still seeing hotel deals come across our desk. Some have not weathered the storm as well as others.\"</p>",
