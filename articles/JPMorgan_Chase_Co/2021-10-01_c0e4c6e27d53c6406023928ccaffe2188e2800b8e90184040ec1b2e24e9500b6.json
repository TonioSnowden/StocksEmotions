  "title": "Glynn's Take: Clamps to Cool Australia's Soaring House Prices Appear Imminent",
  "text": "<p>The main questions are when and how will the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which sets lending criteria for the banks, approach the problem, and what segments of borrowing will be targeted.</p><p>APRA will progress knowing the weaponry it has at its disposal has tamed house price cycles before. A tightening of mortgage-lending regulations in the middle of the past decade caused house prices to fall for a periodâ€”a dip that has been recovered in recent years.</p><p>But where housing investors and interest-only loans were the target of APRA's guns the previous time, it will be riskier loans where low incomes and high debt intersect that take the brunt of regulation this time around.</p><p>There is plenty of smoke to suggest a fire is burning under regulators, and action could be taken within months.</p><p>The Reserve Bank of Australia recently warned about growing systemic risks, while APRA this week said it plans to publish an information paper on a framework for implementing macroprudential policy over the next couple of months.</p><p>Recent warnings about the overheating of the housing market have also come from the heads of major banks, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's office and the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>Data from UBS have also suggested that there has been an increase in the number of people who are exaggerating their financial strength to get a mortgage, adding to the risk around the home loan market.</p><p>\"Red hot activity in the housing market appears to have finally reached the point of discomfort for the Council of Financial Regulators,\" said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p><p>While the stock of household debt isn't materially outpacing growth in household income, it is new lending at high debt-to-income ratios that has risen considerably, Mr. Aird said.</p><p>House prices have grown nationally by more than 20% in the past year and the cause boils down to record-low interest rates and the RBA's signaling no increase until 2024, he said.</p><p>There has been a surge in new lending because of ultralow rates. Households are willing to borrow more and pay more for a dwelling.</p><p>\"It is this latter development that is concerning the Council of Financial Regulators,\" said CBA's Aird.</p><p>APRA's efforts should focus on measures of loan serviceability to take the heat out of the market.</p><p>Policy that addresses debt serviceability won't distort the lending market in a way that targeting a specific debt-to-income ratio might, Mr. Aird said.</p><p>Still, Tom Kennedy, economist at JPMorgan in Sydney, said that high debt-to-income lending is a growing problem, accounting for about one-quarter of all lending in the second quarter, and the trend is rising.</p><p>The data suggest Australia's housing debt-to-income ratio will surpass 145% by early 2022 from around 140% currently, he said.</p><p>Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, thinks APRA will proceed with caution when it rolls out new rules for lending, as there are a lot of headwinds already building against the housing market.</p><p>Deteriorating affordability will naturally slow the pace of growth in 2022 to around one-third the current rate, he said. Supply dynamics might also play a role as property listings increase and a recent construction boom puts the market into oversupply, he said.</p><p>Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com</p>",
