  "title": "Jimmy Cayne, Who Led Bear Stearns Before It Imploded, Dies at 87; Cayne, a blunt, competitive, cigar-smoking executive, loved to play bridge",
  "text": "<p>His death was confirmed by Alison Cayne, his daughter.</p><p>He was absent during key stretches in the firm's final year, golfing or playing competitive bridge, The Wall Street Journal reported and Mr. Cayne later confirmed to federal regulators. Under criticism for those absences and the firm's cratering stock price—and dogged by reports in the Journal that he smoked marijuana recreationally, which he denied—he ceded the CEO job to investment banker Alan Schwartz in January 2008. Two months later, Bear Stearns, hemorrhaging cash, reached a deal to sell itself to JPMorgan, a merger that in the early 2000s Mr. Cayne had rejected.</p><p>The 85-year-old Bear didn't fold but lost its independence, absorbed into what is now the nation's biggest bank. The deal turned out to be a headache for JPMorgan, which paid billions of dollars in mortgage-related settlements tied to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual Inc., its other crisis-era deal. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, has said he wouldn't do it again.</p><p>Bear Stearns was one of the first dominoes in what would become the global financial crisis that tanked the economy and reshaped Wall Street. Six months later, Lehman Brothers failed, Merrill Lynch was absorbed by Bank of America Corp., and the nation's biggest banks took rescue financing from the government.</p><p>James Eliot Cayne was born on Feb. 14, 1934 in Evanston, Ill. He attended Purdue University, but he left before graduating to join the Army. He moved to New York City in 1966 to play bridge, and met his wife, Patricia, playing cards.</p><p>\"He loved that every single hand, every single time was different,\" Ms. Cayne, his daughter, said. \"He never got bored.\" She survives him, along with his wife, another daughter and seven grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. Cayne, a blunt, competitive, cigar-smoking executive remained an archetype of a Wall Street boss now rarely seen. He once told an associate, after meeting her son, \"that kid's got a rotten handshake. He's going nowhere in life.\" He later sued that associate, Alexandra Lebenthal, claiming she failed to repay a $1 million personal loan.</p><p>A former scrap-iron salesman, Mr. Cayne joined Bear in 1969 and developed a rapport with its leader, Alan \"Ace\" Greenberg, also a bridge player, and the pair played regularly at the Regency Whist Club in Manhattan. He rose through its brokerage division and as CEO helped turn the trading powerhouse into a player in deal making and corporate finance.</p><p>Mr. Cayne left Wall Street behind in 2008, but he remained a fixture on the competitive bridge circuit. A world-class player, he won more than a dozen North American championships, his daughter said.</p><p>When reached for comment on the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, Patricia, to whom he was married for 50 years, said: \"He's retired and doing what he loves the best. Actually, it was second best. Bear was first.\"</p><p>Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com</p><p>Jimmy Cayne, Who Led Bear Stearns Before It Imploded, Dies at 87</p>",
