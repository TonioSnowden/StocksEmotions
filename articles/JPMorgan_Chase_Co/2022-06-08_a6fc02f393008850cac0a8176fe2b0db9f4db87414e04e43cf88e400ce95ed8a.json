  "text": "<p>Last month, I was reunited with a friend for the first time since the pre-Covid spring of 2019. We rejoiced on the terrace of a West End restaurant as London's pre-theatre crowd wolfed steak frites. As other friends landed, a hassled waiter scraped a second table along, hit an uneven paving slab and covered my trousers in Chablis.</p> <p>If it wants to compete with that pure shot of real world fun and farce — the roaring convivial heat doused by the cold edge of a dry-cleaning bill — the metaverse may have to work very hard to command the $13tn economy that some predict for it. The current hype — at least for now — may turn out to have been a pandemic phenomenon.</p> <p>That $13tn figure, according to a report published this week by Citi Research, is the top-end theoretical economical reach of the broadest definition of the metaverse by the end of the decade. The term is increasingly deployed to cover all future routes that might be taken by the internet and every person, business and institution that engages with it. The manager of a large global fund tells me he is in love with the idea of it, but cannot point to a single pure-play metaverse stock in his portfolio.</p> <p>Still, plenty of similar forecasts have landed on fund managers' desks in the eight months since Facebook stoked mainstream excitement by declaring its bet on the metaverse — even changing its name to Meta. Inevitably, when asked by ideas-hungry clients how best to play this, the stockbrokers' instinct has been to deepen as far as possible the metaverse-themed basket of corporate names and to pitch the whole narrative in an ungraspable, astronomical range. For now, the best investment bet seems to be the picks and shovels (the digital infrastructure and hardware) that will theoretically underpin the expansion of the metaverse user base into, perhaps, billions of people. The corporate world (intensely so in Asia) has obliged with grandiose metaverse strategies that have, in the majority of cases, cost and committed almost nothing.</p> <p>This stretching of the scope has been easier given the complexity of defining the metaverse. When a panel of world-leading experts wrestled with that challenge at the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c1033cd-1aea-45a1-b883-868395eebd0e\">Global Boardroom</a> event on Tuesday, they did an outstanding job. But they acknowledged that the fundamental story — the convergence of digital and physical lives — was a mixture of genuine migration of work and leisure into the digital world (some of that well under way) and speculative fantasy. This is an investment theme, remember, that allowed JPMorgan to tell investors in January that “a next generation financing company could potentially leverage digital clothing as collateral to underwrite virtual land and property mortgages”, without the sentence seeming out of place. </p> <p>Citi's report, in common with those that have gone before, has the metaverse as: “a virtual 3D space that is interoperable with the physical world, a step-change from the 2D webpage-style content of today's mainstream internet”. Morgan Stanley, in a February report, thought in terms of the narrower “next-generation social media, streaming, gaming and shopping platform”.</p> <p>The internet is clearly poised for a new phase where much of what we now think of as “online” is presented in the form of a virtual world. Gaming, entertainment and parts of the workplace will be the first to make this shift, but the technology will evolve to draw in everything else and eventually the risks to businesses of remaining outside the metaverse will be greater than those of going in.</p> <p>But locked deeply into the $13tn buzz is the issue of timing. The concept of both the metaverse and a distinctive move into a new phase of the internet may have been around for a while, but the truly explosive speculation peaked at a time when the world felt unprecedentedly receptive to the idea of life in a virtual world. </p> <p>The Facebook announcement in October, and the months that followed, were made as much of the world had been forced by the pandemic to swap the norms of social and work life for a digital version. The prospect of emergence from that seemed, at the time, viciously challenged by Omicron. It was a particularly potent time, therefore, to plant the idea that this enforced lurch between the real and digital worlds could become a regular cycle and, not illogically, that millions or even billions might simply decide that the virtual world was the safest nest.</p> <p>A full global emergence from the pandemic is not a foregone conclusion, but those places that have taken the biggest steps back to normality are a reminder that the real world — in all its splendour and spillage — was always going to be a fabulously tough competitor for the virtual one.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/6b8420bb-13f2-4c15-8a0c-6a0eb84f0860.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><a href=\"mailto:leo.lewis@ft.com\"><em>leo.lewis@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Leo Lewis 2022 'Investors' enthusiasm for the metaverse remains overheated' FT.com 8 June.
