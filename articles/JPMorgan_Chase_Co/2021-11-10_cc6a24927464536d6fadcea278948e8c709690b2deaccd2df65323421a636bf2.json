  "title": "Business News:  Barclays New Chief  Shuffles Leadership  ----  By Simon Clark",
  "text": "<p>    Barclays PLC's new chief executive made a slew of executive appointments, putting his stamp on the bank after his predecessor, Jes Staley, resigned last week over how he described his interactions with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. </p><p>    C.S. Venkatakrishnan took over leadership of the London-based lender vowing to build on Mr. Staley's strategy of expanding both retail banking operations in the U.K. and a trans-Atlantic investment bank that includes the former U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers. </p><p>    Paul Compton will head the corporate and investment bank, which he previously led with Mr. Venkatakrishnan, Barclays said Tuesday. They both joined Barclays from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., where Mr. Staley also previously worked. </p><p>    Alistair Currie will lead consumer banking and payments at Barclays. </p><p>    Ashok Vaswani, previously head of consumer banking, was appointed chief digital strategy officer. </p><p>   His new role reflects the need for traditional banks to respond to competition from startup financial technology companies. </p><p>   \"As technology shapes customers' interactions with banks, Ashok will accelerate the strategy and execution of Barclays' consumer-facing digital products and services,\" the bank said. </p><p>   Mr. Staley, 64, stepped down under pressure from regulators over how he characterized his relationship with Epstein. </p><p>   The probe found that Mr. Staley had provided an incomplete picture of his relationship with the financier, according to people familiar with the investigation. </p><p>   Barclays said the investigation didn't find evidence that \"Mr. Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr. Epstein's alleged crimes,\" and said Mr. Staley intended to contest the regulators' conclusions. </p><p>   Barclays shares closed down 1% in trading Tuesday  in London, having risen 29% this year. </p><p></p>",
