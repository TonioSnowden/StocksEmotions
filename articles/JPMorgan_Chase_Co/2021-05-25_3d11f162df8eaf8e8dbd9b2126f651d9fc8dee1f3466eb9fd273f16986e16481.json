  "title": "Sales of Bundled Junk Loans  Surge as Investors Seek Yield  ----  By Sebastian Pellejero",
  "text": "<p>   Sales of securities backed by bundles of risky corporate loans are hitting records, lifted by a recovering economy and demand from yield-starved investors. </p><p>   Issuance of new collateralized loan obligations, which buy up loans to companies with junk credit ratings and package them into securities, totaled over $59 billion as of May 20, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's' LCD. That is the highest-ever figure for that period in data going back to 2005. </p><p>   The prospect of rising inflation and a shift away from the Federal Reserve's easy money policies are making bonds tied to so-called CLOs attractive to a wider range of investors, analysts said. Many are expecting strong growth to prompt Fed tightening, eroding returns on corporate bonds. Yields on CLO bonds typically rise with interest rates. </p><p>   The CLO market's record sales pace marks a reversal from this time last year, when pandemic fears caused debt prices to plummet, freezing sales of new funds. Support from the Fed, including cutting interest rates to near zero and buying the highest-quality bonds from certain types of CLOs, has since helped bring investors back. </p><p>   CLOs have become a $760 billion market, accounting for 70% of new leveraged loan purchases last year, according to Citi. Because CLOs' loan holdings are diversified, the bonds can achieve higher credit ratings than the underlying loans, making them popular among institutions restricted to investment-grade debt, such as banks and insurers. </p><p>   At the same time, the economic rebound is improving the prospects of many companies whose loans are bought by CLOs. Just six nonfinancial, junk-rated companies defaulted during the first quarter of this year, according to Moody's Investors Service -- the lowest level since 2018. The ratings agency expects the trailing 12-month default rate to fall to 3.9% by the end of December, from 7.5% in March. </p><p>   Ratings firms are now putting some CLO securities on review for possible upgrade, which analysts say could spur demand in the months ahead. </p><p>   \"That supports the CLO market because investors see much less tail risk as those issuers get upgraded,\" said Tom Shandell, chief executive of Marble Point Credit Management, which manages $6.2 billion in assets, including CLOs. </p><p>   \"The default environment has been very benign and will be because the capital markets are open to companies that may be struggling a little bit,\" he added. </p><p>   The combination has analysts and investors expecting a banner year for CLO issuance. Bank of America projects sales to total around $360 billion this year, including refinancings, while Citibank expects around $290 billion. Both figures would surpass 2018's all-time high. </p><p>   \"You're going to see a ton of activity in the next few months,\" said Ryan Kohan, loan portfolio manager at Western Asset Management. </p><p>   Critics say CLOs allow companies to borrow more than they can support, exposing investors to losses in a downturn. A wave of leveraged loan downgrades hit CLO managers last year, causing some portfolios to surpass limits on low-rated holdings or breach collateral tests. </p><p>   Some investors are hesitant to add to CLO holdings. As of Friday, the average triple-A-rated CLO bond issued in May paid an extra yield, or spread, of 1.16 percentage points over the London interbank offering rate, or Libor, according to Refinitiv. That is above the record low of 0.98 from March 2018 but down from 1.31 points in December. </p><p>    BlackRock Inc. said in a note it has recently pared CLO exposure, seeking to reduce holdings of debt with limited upside. Some CLO tranches haven't traded consistently, wrote KKR analysts in a recent note, a sign that there could be some fragility lurking underneath the market's surface. </p><p>   \"Despite the high volume of activity, we do not believe that liquidity across the [CLO] market has been uniform and as robust as it may seem,\" they wrote. </p><p>   Still, around two-thirds of respondents to a recent JPMorgan survey said they plan to add CLO holdings to their portfolio in the next six months. In Japan, where low and negative interest rates have made investors there some of the biggest buyers of CLO debt in recent years, the market has started to come back, analysts said, after scaling back purchases in 2020. </p><p>    DJ Lucey, senior portfolio manager at asset manager Sun Life Capital Management, says his firm has favored investment-grade-rated CLO bonds over other similarly rated debt, believing there is still room for gains. </p><p>   \"CLOs are relatively cheap next to arguably very rich corporate credit markets. There's a lot of good news priced into the rest of the investment-grade markets,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
