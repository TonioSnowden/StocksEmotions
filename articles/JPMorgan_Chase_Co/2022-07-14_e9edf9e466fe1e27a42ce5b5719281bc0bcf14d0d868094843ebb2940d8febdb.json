  "title": "Dow Falls, Stocks Open Lower as Banks Kick Off Earnings Season; JPMorgan Chase lifted its provisions for potential future loan losses, signaling a dour outlook for the economy",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase shares fell 4.2% after the bank on Thursday set aside another $428 million to cover possible future loan losses, suggesting it was concerned about the economic outlook.</p><p>\"When you see interest rates move up and there is a downturn in the economy you will inevitably see more people unable to make their loan repayments,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>Morgan Stanley shares slipped 2.4% after it said profit slumped 29% in the second quarter. Both banks reported earnings per share that missed analysts' forecasts, suggesting that earnings estimates are too optimistic, Mr. Innes said.</p><p>Earnings from BlackRock, Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo will follow on Friday. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs will give updates on Monday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude dropped 4.6% to $95.13 a barrel. The international oil benchmark has slumped this month as investors fear a recession would undermine demand.</p><p>In Europe, Italian stocks led losses as political turmoil threatened to topple Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition government. Italy's FTSE MIB fell 3.1%, while the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 declined 1.4%.</p><p>The gap between yields on Italian and German benchmark government bonds widened Thursday. The extra yield, or spread, on Italian 10-year bonds over their German equivalent rose to 1.997 percentage points, according to Tradeweb. At the start of the year, the gap was 1.359 percentage points.</p><p>The stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data released Wednesday suggested rapidly rising consumer prices haven't yet peaked and heightened investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates than previously anticipated. With that backdrop, investors are looking to what bank executives have to say about the state of the economy as much as about their own balance sheets.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.994% from 2.904% on Wednesday while the yield on the two-year bond yield also rose. Bond yields rise as prices fall. The two-year yield rose further above the 10-year yield on Wednesday, a situation known as an inverted yield curve and often taken as a predictor of a recession. The yield curve is close to its most inverted since 2000.</p><p>\"The Fed will keep hiking rates until they get material signs that the economy is rolling over,\" said Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at Mediolanum International Funds. \"Effectively the Fed has got to keep hiking rates until they break something.\"</p><p>Jobless claims edged higher last week, data released Thursday showed. The figures, though low by historic standards, have trended higher in recent weeks.</p><p>Producer price increases picked up in June as suppliers, facing pressure from inflation and high energy prices passed on some of those costs to consumers.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index rose 1.2%. The index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, is close to its highest level in 20 years.</p><p>Gold prices extended their tumble in the wake of the higher-than-expected inflation figures. The precious metal fell 2.2% to $1,700.20 a troy ounce and has lost about 6% this month. While often considered a hedge against inflation, gold becomes less attractive to investors when interest rates rise.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged down 0.2%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.1%.</p><p>â€”Hannah Miao contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Falls, Stocks Open Lower as Banks Kick Off Earnings Season</p>",
