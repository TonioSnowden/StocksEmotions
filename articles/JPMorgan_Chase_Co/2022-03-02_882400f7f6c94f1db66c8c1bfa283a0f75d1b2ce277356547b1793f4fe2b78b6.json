  "title": "OPEC+ Sticks to Small Output Rise as Oil Tops $110; Decision comes after U.S. and IEA released emergency reserves amid worries over supply following Russia's invasion of Ukraine",
  "text": "<p>The OPEC+ decision came a day after the U.S. and other major crude-consuming nations said they would release 60 million barrels of oil from their emergency stockpiles in an attempt to tame surging prices. Cartel officials say OPEC+ didn't discuss any measures to counter this move by the International Energy Agency, though Saudi Arabia has pushed back against previous U.S. requests for extra oil supplies.</p><p>Oil prices have risen sharply in recent months, fueling inflation around the world, in part because several OPEC+ members have been unable to meet their share of production as global demand has picked up.</p><p>Crude prices surged Wednesday to over $110 a barrel for the first time since 2014, as refiners refused to buy Russian oil, taking a bite out of global supplies. Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, rose 5.8% to $111.03 a barrel, extending their advance so far this year to 43%.</p><p>Prices leapt in other pockets of the energy market tied to Russia. European natural-gas prices jumped 30%. So far there has been minimal disruption to the pipeline system in Ukraine, through which about a third of Russian gas exports to Europe flow, according to analysts.</p><p>OPEC members have benefited from the coordination of oil production with Russia and allies, with prices recovering following a sharp fall after the pandemic started. Many of them are now concerned though that a move to replace Russia's oil could lead to a breakdown of their alliance, OPEC delegates said. Riyadh and Moscow fought a price war during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 before reaching a pact to reduce output.</p><p>Some delegates said they pointedly avoided bringing up the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \"Our focus was to remain united, so there was no discussion on political topics,\" said an OPEC delegate. \"The embrace of the Russian bear makes us stronger.\"</p><p>Some delegates said Russia was unlikely to approve any additional supplies, as it benefits from higher oil prices, which could deter the U.S. from imposing sanctions that would hit Moscow's energy sector.</p><p>In a sign of Russia's growing influence, many of the U.S.'s closest oil-producing partners in the Middle East are staying neutral or tempering their criticism of Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, told French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday that the kingdom remained committed to the OPEC+ agreement.</p><p>OPEC officials also say they are worried about the possible return of over 1 million barrels a day of Iranian oil supplies to markets amid progress in nuclear talks with global powers to lift sanctions on Tehran.</p><p>\"We are expecting more production if anuclear deal with Iran works out, [since] there will be production from them,\" Timipre Sylva, the oil minister for key OPEC member Nigeria, said last week.</p><p>The cartel, however, may still change tack if Russian oil disruptions bring prices to levels that are unbearable to consumers.</p><p>The U.S has warned it is also looking at possible energy sanctions on Russia, which is one of the world's top oil-and-gas exporters.</p><p>Russia is already struggling to sell and ship its oil. Refiners have balked at buying Moscow's crude, while banks are refusing to finance shipments of Russian commodities, fearing the impact of sanctions. Tankers have been attacked or blocked in the Black Sea, a key oil export waterway.</p><p>\"Russia is experiencing 'death by 1,000 cuts' on its domestic oil production and sales,\" said Christyan Malek, a managing director in charge of oil and gas at JP Morgan.</p><p>OPEC officials said spiraling oil disruptions and rocketing prices may lead to a change in course. \"If prices rise to a level that would lead to demand destruction, then it is a different situation,\" a Saudi official said. But, \"none of the key players in OPEC+ is willing to act unilaterally otherwise.\"</p><p>â€”Quentin Webb, Dave Sebastian and Joe Wallace contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Quentin Webb at quentin.webb@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>OPEC+ Sticks to Small Output Rise as Oil Tops $110</p>",
