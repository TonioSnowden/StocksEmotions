  "text": "<p>In an amended complaint filed Tuesday, Mr. Arnal is no longer listed as a defendant. Gone are claims from the original complaint that Messrs. Arnal and Cohen colluded to boost the company's share price. The original filing didn't provide evidence for such conversations between the two men. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has said the lawsuit was without merit.</p><p>Mr. Arnal, 52, died by suicide in early September amid a mounting financial crisis at the retailer and shortly after he was accused in the original complaint of having sold Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares while in possession of material insider information. He sold about $1.4 million of stock in August under a prearranged trading plan, filings show.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Mr. Cohen, along with JP Morgan Securities LLC, are still named as defendants in the suit, which seeks class-action status. The amended filing alleges that Mr. Cohen \"orchestrated a market manipulation\" by deceiving individual investors that he would hold on to his investment, boosting Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock price and then \"secretly\" selling his holdings in the company.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Mr. Si declined to comment. Mr. Cohen didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Cohen has previously declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Cohen in March unveiled a stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and called on its management to consider strategic alternatives. The company then added new directors and in June said Chief Executive Mark Tritton would leave. Mr. Cohen unloaded his entire stake in August.</p><p>---</p><p>Suzanne Kapner and Kristin Broughton contributed to this article</p>",
