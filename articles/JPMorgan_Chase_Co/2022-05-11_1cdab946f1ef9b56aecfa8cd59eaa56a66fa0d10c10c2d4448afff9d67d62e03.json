  "text": "<p>The gym franchisor will still offer a standard membership for $10 a month. Even with the more affordable option, Planet Fitness PLNT says six out of 10 members chose the pricier plan.</p><p>\"Within 10 miles of a current Planet Fitness store, there are approximately 140 million people old enough to join a gym but do not belong to any gym,\" said Chris Rondeau, chief executive of Planet Fitness, on the earnings call, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"With fewer competitors due to significant industry consolidation, we believe that perhaps our 4,000 store potential in the U.S. may be the floor and not the ceiling for store growth.\"</p><p>See: Peloton stock plunge continues after earnings bring 'very few things to cheer about'</p><p>Planet Fitness is also reaching out to younger potential members through a program that offers high-school students free membership through the summer. In a statement, Rondeau said the High School Summer Pass gives teens an outlet during the country's current teen mental health crisis. The program is making a return after taking a break for the past two years.</p><p>During the earnings call, Rondeau added that many of the teens who participated in the program became members.</p><p>\"The program resulted in nearly 1 million teen participants and more than 11% of those teens are members today,\" he said.</p><p>Total members reached a record 16.2 million at the end of the quarter.</p><p>Planet Fitness is also expanding beyond the U.S., with a new agreement in New Zealand for a minimum of 25 locations over the next few years, and the first openings in Mexico, where at least 80 locations are planned for the next five years.</p><p>Planet Fitness reported first-quarterprofit that beat expectations, but missed on revenue. Rondeau pointed to the \"ups and downs\" of the quarter, but says there was a rebound in usage and new members as the period progressed.</p><p>\"Post-COVID fitness trends and member adds show Gen Z/millennial cohorts gravitating toward fitness more so than prior generations, with the company working to capitalize on and capture this demand,\" wrote JPMorgan in a note.</p><p>And with inflation soaring, analysts say members might be looking to trade down to a more affordable health club.</p><p>And: High beef prices could drive more consumers to chicken</p><p>\"Franchise appetite undeterred as weighing inflationary pressures on the consumer potentially prompts a shift in demand from expensive boutiques/clubs to value-oriented Planet Fitness,\" JPMorgan said.</p><p>JPMorgan upgraded Planet Fitness stock to overweight from neutral, with a $90 price target.</p><p>\"[W]e see opportunity for upcoming initiatives including the High School Summer Pass [â€¦],improved marketing (following local execution challenges during Q1), and pricing (not expecting Black Card mix to decline following raise to $24.99/month for new joins) to support continued member gains/comps in the quarters ahead,\" wrote Baird analysts.</p><p>Baird rates Planet Fitness outperform with a $92 price target, down from $108.</p><p>Also: Nonprofit company vows to produce generic insulin and sell it for $1 a day</p><p>\"This is the first broad-based increase since 2019, when the price was taken up $1, and prior to that there was an increase in 2017 of $2,\" wrote BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>\"Using these prior hikes as a reference point, management indicated that theyhistorically have seen Black Card acquisition be 'relatively flat' sequentially, but with Black Card penetration still growing year-over-year.\"</p><p>BMO Capital rates Planet Fitness stock outperform with an $88 price target, down from $96.</p><p>Planet Fitness stock rose 3.7% in Wednesday trading and is down 22.4% for the year to date.</p><p>Planet Fitness is raising the price of its Black Card membership but still offers a $10 option</p>",
