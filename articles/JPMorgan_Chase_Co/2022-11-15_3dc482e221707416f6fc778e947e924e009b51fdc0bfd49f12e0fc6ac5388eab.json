  "title": "Banking & Technology:  Most Investors Cheer China Housing Plan  ----  By Rebecca Feng",
  "text": "<p>   Global investors applauded China's new plan to resuscitate its ailing housing market, even as economists said the battered sector is unlikely to rebound quickly from its deep slump. </p><p>   Shares of Chinese property developers surged Monday. Country Garden Holdings Co., one of the country's largest real-estate companies by contracted sales, jumped 46% in Hong Kong, taking its gains this month above 200%. A Hang Seng subindex of Chinese property stocks rose more than 13%. </p><p>   Prices of dollar bonds of developers that haven't defaulted on their debt -- including Agile Group Holdings Ltd. and Longfor Group Holdings Ltd. -- also rose sharply from deeply distressed levels. </p><p>   \"China's housing rescue is finally here,\" China economists Wei Yao and Michelle Lam from Societe Generale Group said in a report Monday. They added, however, that Beijing's plan \"should be viewed as temporary pain relief, rather than a stimulus that could trigger another sustained upswing.\" </p><p>   The rally was sparked by China's move to dial back its real-estate crackdown late last week, when the country's central bank and banking regulator issued a wide-ranging series of measures aimed at supporting the troubled property market. The new policies were signed off on by China's leader, Xi Jinping, The Wall Street Journal reported. Economists and market strategists said they signaled an important shift in tone from crackdown to support. </p><p>   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.7% Monday, adding to last Friday's big gains that followed China's easing of some of its stringent Covid-19 rules. </p><p>   In Australia, shares of mining giants BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto Ltd. also gained on hopes of a recovery in demand from China for raw materials used in building construction. </p><p>   China's property sector accounts for roughly 30% of the country's steel demand and between 20% and 30% of its demand for aluminum, zinc and copper, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar. Still, it is hard to tell how quickly the property sector may recover, given the erosion in home-buyer and creditor confidence, he said. </p><p>   The new policies, which represent Beijing's biggest step yet to rescue the housing market from a downward spiral, included encouraging banks to step up lending to the sector and offer financing to help stronger developers acquire projects from weaker ones. It also allowed developers to extend loans and bonds due in the next six months by a year. </p><p>   While the markets have reacted enthusiastically to the new policies, some economists said the measures, while an important policy pivot, don't represent a full reversal of China's earlier efforts to tame the property sector and appear targeted at engineering a soft landing. </p><p>   The new measures may have \"little direct impact on stimulating home purchases,\" which is the bread and butter of rebooting the industry, said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. He said Beijing's mantra that \"houses are for living in and not for speculation\" hasn't changed. </p><p>   \"Even after a recovery, new home sales could settle on a level significantly lower than prior to the pandemic,\" Mr. Lu said. </p><p>   The new policies also lack measures to boost demand, said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ. Previous demand-side policies such as relaxing purchase limits and mortgage-rate cuts have largely failed to boost property sales, he added. </p><p>   New residential home sales in China have remained sluggish in recent months. Sales in the first nine months of the year totaled the equivalent of $1.2 trillion, a 29% decline from a year earlier, according to data by China's National Bureau of Statistics. </p><p>   While the package of new measures is \"by far the most all-round one\" since the liquidity crisis started in late 2021, it alone isn't a game changer, according to a note JPMorgan wrote to clients Monday. This is because the policies address developers' funding problems but don't solve the core issue of weak property sales, analysts said. A more sustainable rally will depend on proof of sales recovery, they added. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Rhiannon Hoyle contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
