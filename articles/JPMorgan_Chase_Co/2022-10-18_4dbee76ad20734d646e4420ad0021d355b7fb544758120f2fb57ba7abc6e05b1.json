  "text": "<p>\"Recent developments on these fronts — namely, the increasingly hawkish rhetoric from central banks, and escalation of the war in Ukraine — are likely to delay the economic and market recovery,\" wrote JPMorgan strategists led by Kolanovic in a Monday note.</p><p>The risk cutback follows Kolanovic's comment earlier this month that the company's year-end S&amp;P 500 SPX target of 4,800 may not be realized until 2023, or until risk factors ease. His price target implies nearly 30% upside from Tuesday's levels. The large-cap index traded at 3,725 in the afternoon.</p><p>\"Given the recent escalation in hawkish rhetoric, the likelihood of central banks committing a policy mistake with negative global consequences has increased, and this started showing in various cracks in FX and rates markets,\" Kolanovic earlier wrote in a note dated Oct.3. \"Even if a mistake is avoided, a delay will likely be introduced for the global market and economic recovery.\"</p><p>See: Popular U.S. recession gauge is at risk of hitting most-negative level since Reagan era, BMO says</p><p>Despite the cautiousness, Kolanovic has maintained a pro-risk stance in the hope that bearish investor sentiment and positioning could limit further declines in stocks and the expectation that Asian economic growth will support a global recovery.</p><p>\"We expect the global expansion to continue to display resilience through the middle of next year given an unwind of adverse supply shocks, a material slowing in inflation, and a healthy private sector,\" Kolanovic said in the note on Monday.</p><p>See: Want to keep beating the S&amp;P 500 and at much lower risk? Bet on Buffett, and perhaps this younger clone, says fund manager.</p><p>Kolanovic is not the only bull on Wall Street who has grown more cautious as stock-market volatility continues.</p><p>MarketWatch reported on Monday that Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus has just cut his year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 for the second time in three months. Stoltzfus said he now sees the S&amp;P 500 finishing the year at the 4,000 level, implying roughly 6.9% upside from Tuesday. He added that it would take a \"miracle\" for stocks to claw their way back to 4,800 given the uncertain outlook for global markets and the economy.</p><p>U.S. stocks are continuing a two-day rally on Tuesday as investors focused their attention on strong earnings reports from major Wall Street banks. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA climbed 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 1.2%.</p><p>One of Wall Street's most vocal bulls is scaling back his bullish calls on stocks and trimming risk in his bank's model portfolio. Here's why.</p>",
