  "text": "<p>UBS has pledged to return billions more to shareholders as surging income for the world's super wealthy led to a sharp rise in profits in 2020, despite the global pandemic. </p> <p>Ralph Hamers, the Swiss bank's new chief executive, said on Tuesday he was prioritising cost control and digitisation for the group, although he stopped short of unveiling a full strategic plan.</p> <p>UBS said that it intends to expand its plans to return capital to shareholders. It has proposed a dividend of $0.37 a share, payable in April, and added that its focus would further tilt towards share buybacks. It unveiled a SFr4bn ($4.5bn) buyback programme over the next three years, at least SFr1bn of which will be repurchased over the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>Shares in the group rose 4 per cent in early trading, but were up by a little more than 1 per cent by mid-morning.</p> <p>Full-year net profits rose 54 per cent year on year at $6.6bn, well above analysts' expectations of $5.9bn. </p> <p>The bank said it had met or exceeded all of its financial targets for the year. Return on core equity tier one capital — a key measure of the bank's financial strength — was 17. 6 per cent, compared with a targeted range of 12-15 per cent. </p> <p>Mr Hamers said despite UBS's cost/income ratio dropping 12.7 percentage points over the year to 74.1 per cent, expenses would still need to be tackled. </p> <p>“We'll have to operate even more efficiently going forward,” said the 55-year-old Dutchman, who took over from Sergio Ermotti in November, in a call with analysts. “[We need to be] relentless when it comes to discipline around cost. We'll have to be critical in what we invest in.</p> <p>“We'll have to systemically crowd out investments that are not delivering or that are just not good enough or just not strategic enough. That's where I think we can improve.”</p> <p>Mr Hamers has had a tumultuous start since joining the world's largest wealth manager. Last month a Dutch court reopened an investigation into his personal involvement in a huge money-laundering scandal at his former employer, ING.</p> <p>The UBS board has already considered alternatives should the Dutch probe prove too time consuming for Mr Hamers, but chairman Axel Weber has given his chief executive his full support.</p> <p>In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, Mr Hamers said: “I have always acted with good conscience during my tenure at ING and therefore I feel confident in the good outcome of this case. I am well prepared, so I can really focus on my role as&#xa0;UBS&#xa0;CEO.” </p> <p>UBS cautioned that the outlook for 2021 remained uncertain and that Covid-19 posed significant macroeconomic risks. Legal uncertainties are still hanging over the bank. UBS is contesting a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c112e418-6cd7-11e9-a9a5-351eeaef6d84\">€4.5bn French legal fine</a> imposed last year. </p> <p>Over the course of 2020, the bank's balance sheet climbed from $975bn to $1.12tn, with group revenue increasing 12 per cent to $32bn. Total invested assets on behalf of clients rose to $4.2tn, up from $3.6tn a year ago. </p> <p>“The general terms of shareholder focus, accountability and most important efficiency are pointing in the right direction,” said Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan.</p> <p>There was a near tenfold increase in credit-loss provisions to $694m as the effects of Covid-19 were felt on the global economy, but the bank reported rising revenues in all of its main divisions. </p> <p>In its flagship wealth management business, which caters to the world's super-wealthy, revenue grew 3 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2019. Pre-tax profits rose 22 per cent to $936m. </p> <p>The investment banking division chalked up a strong performance, compared with a rockier 2019. Revenue rose 20 per cent compared with the same quarter a year earlier, while pre-tax profits were $529m compared with a $22m loss. </p> <p>The bank was one of the few in Europe to pay out its full dividend as expected last year. The payment was split into two tranches after pressure from Switzerland's market regulator. </p><p>Source: Sam Jones and Owen Walker in London 2021 'UBS plans $4.5bn share buyback as profits jump' FT.com 26 January.
