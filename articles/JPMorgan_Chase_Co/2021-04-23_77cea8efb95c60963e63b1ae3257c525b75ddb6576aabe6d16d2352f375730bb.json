Get in touch with us anytime: </strong><a href=\"mailto:Due.Diligence@ft.com\">Due.Diligence@ft.com</a><strong>.</strong></p> <h2>What's a Spanish football king without his footmen?</h2> <p><strong>Florentino Pérez</strong> is a man with friends in high places.</p> <p>In secret talks over the course of several months, the Spanish construction tycoon and <strong>Real Madrid</strong> president* helped to assemble a powerful band of rebels to form the shortlived <strong>Super League</strong>, a breakaway European football competition.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Some of the owners of the participating clubs — or the “dirty dozen”, as critics chided — include the hedge fund Elliott Management (which controls <strong>AC Milan</strong>), the Russian oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich </strong>(<strong>Chelsea FC</strong>) and <strong>Sheikh Mansour bin</strong> <strong>Zayed Al Nahyan </strong>(<strong>Manchester City</strong>), a member of<strong> Abu Dhabi</strong>'s royal family.&#xa0;</p> <p>The plan was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f00bb232-a150-4f7d-b26a-e1b62cd175c3\">financed</a> by bankers at<strong> JPMorgan Chase</strong>, who committed to underwriting a €3.25bn “infrastructure grant” that was meant to be shared among the 12 clubs as a “welcome bonus” for joining the competition.&#xa0;</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfdbbb9-75e4-4374-8214-977a1ddfce68\">this closer look</a> at Pérez from the FT's Daniel Dombey and DD's Arash Massoudi shows it's his tight inner circle that's integral to his empire.</p> <p>His two trusted advisers work at <strong>Key Capital</strong>, a little-known Madrid-based brokerage and advisory boutique, that is instrumental to his plans to upend European football and transform his construction group <strong>ACS</strong> into the world's biggest toll road operator (DD breaks down the latter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2966b0f3-84a8-494a-ad36-620ed2f3896f\">here</a>).</p> <p>Enter <strong>Anas Laghrari</strong>, a 37-year-old Moroccan at Key whom Pérez has known since his birth.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Laghrari, a former <strong>Société Générale</strong> derivatives banker, joined Key in 2013 and is basically like family to Pérez, who once had a construction business venture with Laghrari's father.</p> <p>“Anas has Florentino's entire trust. If Anas doesn't like something or doesn't trust something, Florentino will not do the deal,” said one person that worked closely with both men.</p> <p>And then there is<strong> Borja Prado</strong>, a 65-year-old dealmaker who has advised Pérez for decades during gigs at <strong>Rothschild</strong>, <strong>Lazard</strong> and<strong> Mediobanca</strong>. Prado also spent a decade as chair of <strong>Endesa</strong>, the Spanish electricity group acquired by Italy's <strong>Enel</strong> in a 2009 deal**.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Prado</strong> is also chair of London-based <strong>Peninsula Capital</strong>, a private equity firm that employs the son of former French president <strong>Nicolas Sarkozy </strong>and is backed with funding from <strong>Qatar</strong>.</p> <p>(And outside the realm of finance, Prado, whose father was a close confidante of former Spanish king<strong> Juan Carlos</strong>, can be found breeding cattle for bullfights at <strong>Torrealta</strong>, a prestigious ranch. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50--scN37iQ\">Here's Prado</a> speaking about the bulls at the 2:45-minute mark.)</p> <p>The Super League collapse and subsequent backlash from livid fans is only the latest adversity Pérez and Prado have been through. There was the time in 2006 when Pérez quit as Real Madrid president following a poor set of results, or the financial crisis, after which ACS had to sell assets to shore up its position.</p> <p>“You can go back in time and find Borja getting votes for Pérez to become chair of Real Madrid,” one Spanish executive who knows the men well told Arash. “They are as close as it gets.”</p> <p>As Pérez's football dreams stand defeated for now and his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b05185a-9782-403d-bbf6-7fe708006c23\">€10bn bid</a> to buy Italy's largest motorway network from <strong>Atlantia</strong> is looking challenged, he will need his most trusted advisers now more than ever.</p> <h2>Tata seeks to reinvent after an epic family feud</h2> <p>Through much of its 150-year history, the <strong>Tata Group</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02ea9961-3db5-4cd5-9c32-eadd0bdea0f0\">pioneered the development</a> of India's economy with everything from steelmaking to aviation.</p> <p>Yet its modern iteration looks less cutting-edge. The storied group hasn't kept up with growth in India's consumer and digital markets, while legacy businesses like cars and power have struggled.</p> <p>Tata has also been mired in one of its most ignominious spells: A bitter dispute with former chair <strong>Cyrus Mistry</strong>, who was fired in 2016 and whose family is a large shareholder.</p> <p>The courtroom drama, which led to fierce scrutiny of Tata's mixed business record, was finally resolved last month when the Supreme Court rejected the Mistry family's claim that Cyrus was wrongfully ousted.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FT's Ben Parkin lays it all out in a dispatch from New Delhi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/707f6611-d8ba-4b08-b39b-76b02d2b0d81\">here</a>.</p> <p>Yet Tata now faces the even more daunting task of reclaiming its pioneering reputation. <strong>Natarajan Chandrasekaran</strong>, chair of holding company <strong>Tata Sons</strong>, wants to simplify the convoluted group — which is spread across dozens of companies — and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02ea9961-3db5-4cd5-9c32-eadd0bdea0f0\">sharpen its focus</a>.</p> <p>He has brought its food and beverage brands — which include<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/693a9bb7-31d5-4b65-8885-d381db51d5bf\"><strong> Tetley Tea</strong></a> — together in a new-look consumer-goods company designed to compete with the likes of <strong>Nestlé</strong>.</p> <p>Chandrasekaran told the FT last year that Tata would launch a “super app”, an all-in-one <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cac74a6a-3e03-4050-a9ab-7c56698157b8\">digital platform</a> of the sort popular in China, that he hopes will propel the company to the top of India's consumer internet market alongside the likes of <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Mukesh Ambani</strong>'s<strong> Jio</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But some are sceptical of whether they can catch up. “They've missed the retail bus,” one analyst said. Others, however, think their 150 years of experience and reputation will stand them in good stead as they try to stage a comeback.</p> <h2>Lex Greensill: suited and booted</h2> <p>DD readers are by now painfully aware of Lex Greensill's public persona.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7363a40c-f250-4e1a-bdff-002f065151f8\">the latest update</a> on the saga: <strong>David Cameron</strong>'s frantic attempts to lobby for struggling <strong>Greensill Capital </strong>last year included contacting the most senior official in the <strong>UK Treasury</strong> and sending multiple messages to the deputy governor of the <strong>Bank of England</strong>.</p> <p>Today, however, we're here to discuss a somewhat controversial trend peddled by Greensill that's become a topic of conversation in the (virtual) FT newsroom.</p> <p>And no, it's not <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ca7b05d-f1a8-4ddd-8fda-3383f11e5143\">supply chain finance</a>. It's suits with boots.</p> <p>For many of us, the widely circulated photograph of the Australian financier and former prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ed619c0-bb9a-44dc-a2f6-c5596a958ca8\">Cameron</a>, which was taken on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3cf4459-dd54-49c1-a777-276f8ae0d406\">desert adventure</a> to woo the Saudi crown prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong>, could not be unseen. (Go <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9467651/One-David-Camerons-civil-servants-allowed-work-Greensill-Whitehall.html\">here</a> to check out the photo. We don't have the rights, sadly).&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>For British journalist Nicholas Foulkes, it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/834ccb50-7342-4a9b-ad4e-989f89f3b0ba\">Greensill's ankle boots</a> — protruding from his trousers, their fabric pull tabs clearly visible — that were particularly bothersome.</p> <p>The offending boots, by Australian heritage brand <strong>RM Williams</strong>, are designed for life in the outback, meaning Greensill has every right to be trudging through the Arabian sands in them. Just maybe not with that outfit.</p> <p>At least Greensill's fashion faux-pas comes at the benefit of another Australian billionaire — the mining magnate <strong>Andrew Forrest</strong>, whose private investment vehicle <strong>Tattarang </strong>bought the brand last October. Any publicity is good publicity?</p> <p>Our Whitehall Editor Sebastian Payne is one paying, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SebastianEPayne/status/1381909328781836289\">if not slightly conflicted</a>, customer.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> appointed<strong> Alex Oh</strong> as its new director of the division of enforcement. She was previously a partner at <strong>Paul Weiss</strong> and before that, an assistant US attorney in the criminal division of the <strong>Southern District of New York</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters</strong> has hired <strong>René Döring</strong> as a partner in its employment law practice.

But behind the captivating collapse is a story about money and power months in the making.
