European and Asian stock markets <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/925100e0-e9e0-45f3-8ad8-1648541c59bf\">fell today</a> after the US Federal Reserve announced a third straight 0.75 percentage point rise in interest rates, and suggested it would keep borrowing costs high well into next year to tame rampant inflation.</p> <p>In one of his gloomiest pronouncements to date, Fed chair Jay Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af12dcb4-bab2-4aa7-8462-2941ca58cd1d\">refused to rule out a recession</a> in the world's largest economy after the US central bank raised interest rates to a target range of between 3 per cent and 3.25 per cent.</p> <p>“No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so, how significant that recession would be,” Powell said in response to a question at a press conference after the decision.</p> <p>Powell's stark comments <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d5764e7-3524-4898-b775-ed315c5e302e\">caught US investors off guard</a>. An early rally faded and the S&amp;P 500 ended the day 1.7 per cent lower, taking its losses for the year to more than 20 per cent. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite declined 1.8 per cent. </p> <p>In currency markets, the dollar extended its recent strength. The yen hit a fresh 24-year low against the US currency, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e039392-a302-440d-9ad6-47ddecd44567\">triggering an intervention by authorities</a> for the first time since the late 1990s. The South Korean won hit a 14-year low, breaching Won1,400 to the dollar for the first time since the financial crisis in 2008.</p> <p>In Europe, sterling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/049eb5e1-a5ab-49b8-a54e-e63d51588c64#post-62e71e11-e893-40ee-98f6-43552c41967a\">extended its recent declines against the greenback</a>, falling below $1.13. The Bank of England is due to announce its latest interest decision later today, with analysts at JPMorgan saying it is too “close to call” whether the UK central bank will raise its policy lending rate by 50 or 75 percentage points.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, central banks followed the Fed in continuing to tighten monetary policy as they try to stamp out inflation. Norway's central bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/049eb5e1-a5ab-49b8-a54e-e63d51588c64#post-6dfb91e9-f754-458e-9fde-f2f4ec0180c5\">lifted its benchmark rate</a> by 50 basis points and the Swiss National Bank increased its key lending rate by 75bp, taking it into positive territory for the first time since 2014. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion:</strong> The surge in US borrowing costs is having spillover effects for the rest of the world, brewing a global backlash against the Fed, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8f7889bd-b129-421e-9013-ab1adbf6d5dc\">writes Claire Jones</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you think the Fed is raising interest rates too quickly?

In a new podcast, labour and equality correspondent Taylor Nicole Rogers explains how these and other new unions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd3823ac-b4c0-47ad-bc23-4f902ef48172\">are running up against a classic problem</a> when trying to organise in the US.</p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia and the US are drifting back on to the rocks</strong> Joe Biden's embarrassment at fist bumping Mohammed bin Salman in July would have been worth it if it had undercut Vladimir Putin's Russia, says Edward Luce. No such result has been visible, he says.
