  "text": "<h1>The courage of her convictions</h1> <p>On a rainy Thanksgiving last November, I found myself in a pink Spanish colonial house in a leafy suburb of Nashville, Tennessee. Framed photographs of assorted <strong>Kennedys</strong>, <strong>Thatchers</strong> and <strong>Reagans</strong> looked down upon me, surrounded by four sleeping dogs, as I received a whistle-stop tour of supply-side economics from a man who has made studying taxation and incentives his life's work.<br><br>The motivations of my visit to the home of sprightly octogenarian economist <strong>Arthur Laffer</strong>, he of Laffer Curve fame, was not an economics seminar — although I certainly learned a lot. It was his decades-long mentorship to fund manager&#xa0;<strong>Cathie Wood</strong>. Laffer is just one of the dozen or so people from Cathie's inner circle whom I spoke with for this FT Weekend Magazine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a93f4de2-35d2-44e1-a6a1-0000cba0dd4d\">cover story</a> on Wood and her firm, <strong>Ark Invest</strong>. Look out for a cameo appearance from fellow tech evangelist <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, whose electric carmaker <strong>Tesla</strong> has (until recently) been responsible for a big part of Ark's returns.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8840924.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The magazine profile chronicles Wood's rise from precocious student at the University of Southern California — where she first encountered Laffer — to her stints at <strong>Jennison Associates</strong>, <strong>Tupelo Capital</strong> and most recently <strong>AllianceBernstein</strong>, where she was working when she had a spiritual epiphany. Within five minutes, the key foundations of what would become Ark's approach came to her: adopting open source research, embracing online media, investing in innovation.</p> <p>But right now Wood is facing the toughest test of her career. Assets in Ark's overall stable of thematic exchange traded funds have dropped to $23.1bn from their peak of $61bn a year ago. Its flagship Ark Disruptive Innovation ETF, stock market ticker ARKK, has more than halved in value in the same period, during which time every single one of the fund's 36 stocks has dropped over 20 per cent. And crucially, despite its stellar long-term record, most of its longer-term returns came when it had a much smaller asset base, meaning that most investors in Ark's funds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d26e8ee6-f724-4a7a-8cef-61bd5f101c28\">are underwater</a>. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8840660.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Critics — and there are many — argue that Cathie Wood's success owes more to the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy than to her investment research or stockpicking prowess. To these detractors, Wood represents the worst aspects of a frothy market, the gatecrashing of low-information retail investors and the triumph of a good story over hard data. None of which can end soon enough. For her retail following, she represents a middle finger to all of that. Fans want to believe her stories of a better, brighter future filled with flying cars, green energy and longer, healthier lives.</p> <p>As the US gears up for interest rate rises this year, Wood and the kinds of hot but unprofitable tech stocks that she favours are fighting against the tide of central banks. Another of her mentors, Jennison co-founder <strong>Spiros “Sig” Segalas</strong>, puts it like this: </p> <blockquote>  <p>“The problem right now is that interest rates are going up, and that tends to hurt valuations, particularly of growth companies with no current earnings power. A lot will depend on what happens to inflation and interest rates as to when her strategy is going to work. Eventually I think she'll be right, but I don't know how long that takes.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Wood, for her part, displays the dogged conviction that has characterised her entire career. She told me:</p> <blockquote>  <p>”We're at our best when the odds are against us. For compliance reasons, I've been asked not to give numbers, but the compound annual rate of return expectation that we have during the next five years is the largest I have ever seen in my career.”</p> </blockquote> <p>What do you think — will the markets stay “irrational” longer than Ark can stay solvent?

The bet did not work out. The shares have tumbled around 70 per cent since the close of trading on February 25 as investors ditch Russian assets. Polymetal has been ejected from the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59f346c2-710f-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926\"> FTSE 100 index</a>. </p> <p>BlackRock is among a large group of global investors, from pension plans, to hedge funds, and allocators of sovereign wealth, who hold Russian assets that were worth almost $170bn at the end of 2021. Moscow's equity markets are suspended, trading in many Russian firms listed abroad is halted, and bonds are almost impossible to trade. That leaves these asset managers facing the prospect of deep losses, my colleagues report in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dca77dfb-f5a8-4e99-a53f-a2778d115410\">this analysis</a>.</p> <p>“If you're left holding Russian assets either you sell at a very low price, assuming that it's possible and you can actually find a buyer,” said <strong>Cristian Maggio</strong>, head of emerging markets portfolio strategy at <strong>TD Securities</strong>. “Otherwise you may have to write them off to zero.”</p> <p>Norway's $1.3tn oil fund and <strong>Fidelity International</strong> are among the foreign investors to heavily write down the value of their Russian assets — in some cases to zero. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Prosperity Capital Management</strong>, one of the oldest and largest hedge fund investors in Russia with around $3bn in assets, has suspended investor redemptions and net asset value calculations as its Russian Prosperity fund fell 51 per cent this year to February 24.</p> <p>In markets where Russian assets are still changing hands, prices have collapsed. Russia's dollar debt is trading at roughly 20 cents on the dollar, while an MSCI index tracking Russian stocks traded in London and New York is down more than 95 per cent this year.</p> <p>So far at least 26 fund managers including <strong>JPMorgan Asset Management</strong>, <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Amundi</strong>, <strong>UBS</strong>, <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>, <strong>Abrdn</strong>, <strong>Schroders</strong> and <strong>Pictet</strong> have frozen funds with Russia exposure since the invasion, stopping investors from moving their more than €4bn in combined assets out of the strategies. </p> <p>More are expected to follow. Foreign holdings of Russian equities reached a total of $86bn at the end of 2021, <strong>Moscow Exchange</strong> data show. Foreign investors also held $20bn of Russia's dollar debt and rouble-denominated sovereign bonds worth $41bn, according to the central bank, while <strong>JPMorgan</strong> estimates corporate debt holdings at $21bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile turbulent times are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c781fdc-3e37-4748-bb1c-d688e6883f20\">upending hedge funds</a>, writes <em>Laurence Fletcher</em>. The pace of the interest rate hiking cycle and Ukraine war have forced a scramble to reposition portfolios. <strong>Pharo Management</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf5d732f-b2e0-4b3b-a545-64cdf85aeec5\">took a hit</a> from tumbling Russian debt prices.</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>Commodity prices surged last week by the most on records going <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5753f4dd-1e8e-4159-a4e4-d232e4ad50ed\">back to 1970</a> as the cost of raw materials from oil to wheat shot higher on concerns the war in Ukraine will diminish already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fdcbc36-7c3f-44ae-a1db-b4a14af67529\">low global supplies</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The S&amp;P GSCI index, a broad measure of global commodities prices, rallied 20 per cent to the highest level since 2008, writes <em>Adam Samson</em>. The increase came as European natural gas, a fuel that is widely used across industry, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6a28dd9-ecea-4d67-b6b5-a50301b731b2\">wheat</a>, a key grain in food production, reached record highs.&#xa0;Oil prices have also climbed rapidly as many big consumers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc93a656-5305-4642-9bc5-6922e33faa06\">shun Russian crude</a>. </p> <p>Global investors are now grappling with how to position their portfolios for a double whammy of higher and more sustained inflation and a slowdown in economic growth. The term “stagflation” is beginning to pop up with worrying&#xa0;regularity.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Ongoing events in Ukraine point to a prolonged military conflict, triggering extensive sanctions in response,” analysts at UK bank <strong>Barclays</strong> said at the weekend.&#xa0;“Soaring commodity prices and risk aversion in financial markets are the main contagion channels, implying a global stagflationary shock, with Europe being the most exposed region.”</p> <p><strong>Bruce Kasman</strong>, <strong>JPMorgan</strong> chief economist, took a similar view, noting that the conflict had prompted the Wall Street bank to make a “substantial” cut to its global growth outlook, with Europe taking an especially big hit.&#xa0;</p> <p>JPMorgan now expects global economic growth to clock in at 3.1 per cent, down 0.8 percentage points from a previous estimate less than a month ago. Inflation, meanwhile, is forecast to come in at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022, up almost a full percentage point from the bank's previous estimate.&#xa0;</p> <p>The situation for Russia is, of course, much worse. JPMorgan expects the country's economic output will fall 12.5 per cent from peak to trough, on a par with the country's financial crisis in 1998.&#xa0;</p> <h1>10 unmissable stories this week</h1> <p>Trouble never seems to be far from <strong>H2O Asset Management</strong>, which is under investigation by multiple financial regulators. Its flagship fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63c8dbc5-f8cb-4db7-b504-3b37409437b3\">carried a bet</a> on the Russian rouble that was equivalent to nearly half of its assets just weeks before <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> launched his invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>How does ESG continue to evolve, wonders <em>Merryn Somerset Webb. “</em>It will continue to evolve until one way or another it encompasses everything. Then, like everything that has tried to be all things to all men before, it will mean nothing.” Notably she explores whether defence stocks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9073a69f-bc90-4944-b9d9-d2a0a2ff1f15\">are now ESG</a> — because surely supplying weapons to the invaded underdog in an unprovoked fight is a social good.</p> <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06a6d4f8-c3c0-4bc9-988d-d9f58fc5358f\">inflationary pressures</a> including for energy, food and other commodities, and depressed the economic growth outlook, according to <strong>Nicolai Tangen</strong>, chief executive of Norway's $1.3tn oil fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. </p> <p><strong>Peter Harrison</strong>, chief executive of £731bn UK asset manager <strong>Schroders</strong>, said the war sharpens the urgency for a rapid expansion of renewable power to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e98393b-13d1-4ab7-a584-cec5a6c8fbff\">reduce European dependency</a> on Russian energy. </p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Man Group</strong> chief executive <strong>Luke Ellis</strong> is “sceptical” of whether markets had really seen the end of “easy money”, and argued that the war likely means central banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76eaa674-1dc9-4faa-8060-695ef540ebc6\">will take longer to tighten</a> the ultra-loose monetary policy. </p> <p>The UK should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96dc133d-0b84-4878-9462-554eb7e0ef91\">borrow more</a> to fund targeted projects that stimulate productivity in order to combat the “depressing” economic outlook, according to <strong>Andrew Law</strong>, head of global macro hedge fund <strong>Caxton Associates</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Russian bonds have tumbled this week as investors braced themselves for the possibility that the latest round of western sanctions could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a72d966-15ee-424a-bc62-1f46980827d4\">push Moscow to default</a> on its debt for the first time since 1998.</p> <p>Senior European officials including <strong>Christine Lagarde</strong> are pushing for new measures to make sure crypto isn't used <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/325864c5-01c5-4373-bdd2-aaa56400b30b\">to dodge sanctions</a>, adding to calls from UK lawmakers and Washington heavyweights including Senator<strong> Elizabeth Warren</strong>. </p> <p>But crypto exchanges have resisted calls, including from Ukraine's vice-prime minister, to support the western effort to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33c79ec2-6d26-4083-9093-2f05c3010536\">freeze Russia out</a> of the financial system by blocking the country. <strong>Jesse Powell</strong>, founder of the exchange <strong>Kraken</strong>, said his company's mission was to “bridge individual humans out of the legacy financial system and bring them into the world of crypto . . . where they don't have to worry about being caught in broad, indiscriminate wealth confiscation”. </p> <p>The <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> opened 300 probes into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f66ef57e-e52f-485b-bc37-e9f577057c72\">unauthorised cryptocurrency operators</a> over the course of six months last year, as the UK financial watchdog pushes back against a wave of scams and unregulated ventures.</p> <h1>And finally</h1> <p>In the last two decades of her career, <strong>Louise Bourgeois</strong> began to incorporate clothes from all stages of her life into her art. This developed into a varied body of work — from monumental installations, to figurative sculptures and abstract collages — incorporating textiles such as bed linen, handkerchiefs, tapestry, and needlepoint. This <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/art-exhibitions/louise-bourgeois-woven-child\">exhibition</a> at the Hayward Gallery is the first major retrospective of this legendary French-American artist to focus exclusively on her work using fabrics and textiles.</p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew, Asset Management Editor  2022 'Cathie Wood: ‘a boom or bust investor' tries to keep a sinking Ark afloat ' FT.com 7 March.
