  "text": "<p>The Marshall Plan was a multi-pronged U.S. strategy after World War Two to rebuild Europe, help modernize its economy and block communism from taking root in the impoverished and war-torn continent.</p><p>The U.S. spent the equivalent of more than $100 billion in today's dollars to finance the ambitious program at the dawn of the Cold War. The program was the brainchild of George C. Marshall, the former Army chief of staff and secretary of state.</p><p>With a new cold war of sorts emerging after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly urged Biden on Wednesday to craft a similarly ambitious strategy to ensure energy independence for the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>Read:Jamie Dimon tells Biden the U.S., Europe need ‘Marshall Plan' for energy independence</p><p>A new Marshall plan of sorts would entail increased production of U.S. fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas as well as efforts to produce more energy from solar, wind, hydrogen and other “green” sources.</p><p>The Biden administration is already focused on electric cars and other clean sources of energy, but it's also been trying to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels in response to the threat of climate change. The U.S. is the world's biggest oil producer.</p><p>Europe is especially reliant on Russian-produced oil and natural gas. Prices have spiked both in Europe and the U.S. after the attack on Ukraine and ensuing sanctions imposed on Russia. High energy prices could even threaten recession.</p><p>Read:A Russian oil-sparked U.S. recession? This is how it could happen</p>",
