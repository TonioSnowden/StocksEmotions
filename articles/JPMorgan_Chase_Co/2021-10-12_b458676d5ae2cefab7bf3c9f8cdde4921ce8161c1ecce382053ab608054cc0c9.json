  "text": "<p>Stock indexes have been dragged lower in choppy trading in recent weeks. Investors are contending with an energy crunch that threatens to add to inflationary pressures just as signs emerge that global economic growth is slowing.</p><p>Concerns about China's struggling real-estate sector continue. Two board members of embattled developer Fantasia resigned, days after the company failed to make a $206 million bond payment. Its troubles add to worries that China's property sector difficulties extend beyond Evergrande, whose failure to meet its debt payments raised concerns about a fresh drag on the world's second-biggest economy.</p><p>Oil prices continued their ascent Tuesday, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark rising 0.2% to $80.83 a barrel, its highest level since 2014. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 0.4% to $83.92 a barrel. Crude prices have been on an extended climb in recent weeks amid a world-wide shortage of natural gas.</p><p>Investors are looking to the third-quarter earnings season, which begins this week, for clues on how companies are faring with price increases. Some of the U.S.'s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, are set to kick off the reporting season Wednesday.</p><p>\"The main topic will be inflation, there is some real concern about a winter of discontent,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy for Mediolanum International Funds. \"We could see some volatility if companies don't get their communications right on their cost pressures.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, investors are also awaiting the International Monetary Fund's world economic outlook report, which should offer insight into the faltering post-pandemic recovery. U.S. data on job openings and labor turnover are due at 10 a.m. ET.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.612% Tuesday from 1.604% Friday. U.S. bond markets were closed Monday for a federal holiday. Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, have been on an upward trajectory since the Federal Reserve strongly signaled last month it could start tapering its bond purchases as soon as November.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.1% Tuesday, led by automotive and mining companies.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were broadly lower. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 lost 0.9%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.4%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.3%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Waver Amid Energy, Inflation Concerns</p>",
