  "title": "Vodafone guides towards higher capital spending as revenues fall",
  "text": "<p><strong>Vodafone</strong> guided towards rising capital expenditure as the telecoms group accelerates investment into digital services, 5G and business-to-business services. </p> <p>Group revenue for the full year to March was down 2.6 per cent to €43.8bn as Covid-19 restrictions cut roaming and visitor revenue, as well as foreign exchange movements. Adjusted ebitda slipped 1.2 per cent to €14.4bn.</p> <p>Management also set out midterm targets for the first time with Vodafone guiding for revenue growth in Europe and Africa and mid single-digit underlying earnings growth.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs said Vodafone's new capex guidance “will drive a 7-9 per cent annual free cash flow hit over the next three years. In our view, this overshadowed the group's first-ever midterm guidance for high quality growth.”</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Britvic</strong> posted a half-year profit to March of £33.2m, down 14.7 per cent, as pandemic restrictions cut volumes sold through the hospitality sector and for on-the-go consumption. The drinks bottler reinstated its interim dividend and said it was ramping up investment following encouraging trading in the first weeks of the second half. </p> <p><strong>Micro Focus</strong> said first-half trading has beaten market expectations. The software and IT services group said it generated $1.4bn in revenue for the six months ended April on an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 36 per cent. Strong sales execution and earlier than expected deal closings helped bolster performance and Micro Focus left full-year revenue guidance unchanged. </p> <p><strong>Imperial Brands</strong> reported first-half organic adjusted revenue of £3.57bn, up 2.4 per cent year on year but slightly weaker than consensus expectations. The tobacco maker blamed lower US trade inventories and a drop in travel retail sales due to the pandemic. Nevertheless, Imperial left full-year guidance unchanged. </p> <p><strong>Phoenix</strong>, the retirement group that owns Standard Life Assurance and ReAssure, confirmed it is now in advanced discussions about the potential sale of its European businesses. Sky News <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/phoenix-close-to-offloading-european-arm-to-elg-in-550m-deal-12309460\">had reported earlier</a> that Phoenix was close to agreeing a £550m deal to sell its European operations to European Life Group, a privately owned vehicle backed by the private equity fund Sixth Street.</p> <p>Property developer <strong>Landsec</strong> said its pre-tax loss for the year ending March widened to £1.4bn from an £837m loss the year before as like-for-like rental income dropped 30 per cent. It said that while the London property investment market remained resilient, central London office markets were still subdued which could translate into some rental weakness. The near-term outlook for retail remains challenging, particularly for shopping centres, Landsec added. Its portfolio valuation as measured by net tangible assets fell 17.4 per cent to 985p per share.</p> <p><strong>Homeserve</strong> said its Home Experts division, which operates the Checkatrade&#xa0;portal in the UK, should reach profitability this year. Group revenues for the full year to March rose 15 per cent to £1.3bn and profit was up 6 per cent to £191.3m, Homeserve said. However, the scrapping of a consumer relationship management system came at a cost of £84.8m and meant statutory pre-tax profit fell by two-thirds to £47.2m.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>DCC</strong> named former JPMorgan mergers and acquisitions executive <strong>Mark Breuer</strong> to succeed current chair <strong>John Moloney</strong> from July. News of the appointment came as DCC posted full-year results to March showing adjusted operating profit up 7.3 per cent to £530.2m. The fuel, marketing and support services conglomerate said 2022 “will be another year of profit growth and development”.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Energy groups must stop all new <strong>oil and gas exploration projects</strong> from this year if global warming is to be kept in check, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bf04fff-5b2f-4d96-a4ea-ff55e029f18e\">the International Energy Agency said</a>. The proposal is one radical aspect of a scenario outlined by the Paris-based institution in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050\">a report</a>&#xa0;released today on ways to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, the level required to keep temperatures from rising above 1.5C.</p> <p><strong>Amazon</strong> is in talks to acquire <strong>MGM</strong>, the film studio behind the James Bond franchise, for about $9bn, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86f1d781-e8a7-4ca0-97e5-cbca1282d6f4\">according to people familiar with the matter</a>. After a wave of mega-consolidation, MGM is one of the few Hollywood studios not to have been gobbled up by a larger conglomerate. It has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic as cinemas have remained largely empty in the US and Europe over the past year. MGM postponed releasing the blockbuster Bond film&#xa0;<em>No Time To Die&#xa0;</em>four times.</p> <p>Warren Buffett's <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> sold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8f9c368-2a3c-490e-a289-ec8a1216f943\">the vast majority of its stake</a> in <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> in the first quarter, unloading an investment that has been a staple of the conglomerate's portfolio dating back to 1989. The company disclosed on Monday it had shed 99 per cent of its remaining stake in the bank —&#xa0;or some 51.7m shares —&#xa0;reducing its holdings in Wells Fargo to just $26.4m at the end of March.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Pilita Clark</strong> <br>The world has rarely seen any environmental idea take off like the push to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Yet for many businesses, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b956926d-73e0-4167-a256-2abb64563ac0\">the rush to net zero</a> looks like a looming car crash.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>The current market value of Britain's listed pub and restaurant groups suggests, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c5e7d9-9e48-40c9-bf12-9a37425ef3f6\">on a very rough gauge</a>, that future earnings per share will return to about 80 per cent of the levels expected at the start of 2019. To some analysts, that's overly pessimistic.</p> <p><em>The FT has launched a new email.
