  "text": "<p>US media tycoon Barry Diller and music mogul David Geffen are under investigation for potential insider trading connected to the purchase of Activision Blizzard options days before the video game maker agreed to be acquired by Microsoft, said people briefed about the matter. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The US Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are each probing to determine whether Diller and Geffen used non-public information to profit from Microsoft's $75bn takeover of Activision. Alexander von Furstenberg, the son of Diller's wife, the acclaimed fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, is also being investigated. </p> <p>In a transaction executed by JPMorgan, the three acquired Activision options for $40 per share on January 14. Activision shares closed at $65 that day. Four days later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">Microsoft said it would acquire Activision</a> in an all-cash transaction valuing the company behind <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> at $95 per share. &#xa0;</p> <p>The three have yet to sell their options, said those briefed about the matter, but at present stand on about $60mn worth of paper gains. They had acquired about $108mn worth of Activision options, which are now worth about $168mn. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision has yet to close, but if completed the three could net more than $100mn.</p> <p>JPMorgan reported the trade to US authorities after the deal was announced, as the US bank is obliged to disclose any transaction where it has evidence or is concerned about any potentially illegal activity as part of a criminal settlement it reached in 2020 connected to market manipulation, said a person briefed about the matter. JPMorgan declined to comment.</p> <p>“None of us had any knowledge from any person or any source or any anything about a potential acquisition of Activision by Microsoft,” Diller told the Financial Times.</p> <p>“We acted simply on the belief that Activision was undervalued and therefore had the potential for going private or being acquired. And if we had any such information, we would never have traded on it. It strains credulity to believe we would have done so three days before Microsoft and Activision made their announcement,” he added. </p> <p>The justice department declined to comment on the investigation and the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Diller, who leads IAC, which has backed a variety of internet media brands, including Tinder and Expedia, is a friend of Activision's chief executive Bobby Kotick. The two also sit on the board of Coca-Cola, although the beverage company said Kotick would step down this year. Kotick declined to comment.</p> <p>Diller added that “because of the timing, we immediately told our lawyers to preserve everything because we were sure somebody would say, ‘Well, how could this be such a coincidence?' It turns out, that's all it is.”</p> <p>The media tycoon and Geffen have been close friends for decades after both dropped out of the University of California, Los Angeles to pursue Hollywood careers in the 1960s, starting as low-level employees at the William Morris talent agency. </p> <p>Diller became one of Hollywood's most successful film and television producers and Geffen became a music mogul, but both built the bulk of their multibillion-dollar fortunes as investors.</p> <p>He led Paramount Pictures in the 1970s and 1980s, producing blockbuster films including <em>Grease </em>and <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, before building up Fox Broadcasting for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Diller left Hollywood in the early 1990s to bet on the internet, creating IAC/InterActive, which has spun off numerous public companies including Expedia, Ticketmaster and Match Group. </p> <p>Geffen was one of the most successful music producers from the 1970s into the 1990s, working with artists such as Jackson Browne and releasing hit records for Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Guns N' Roses. Geffen, however, has made billions as an investor, betting on companies such as Apple and in hedge funds.</p> <p>The probes were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. </p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan and Antoine Gara in New York and Stefania Palma in Washington 2022 'US probes Barry Diller and David Geffen over Activision trades before $75bn merger' FT.com 9 March.
