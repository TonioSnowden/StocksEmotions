  "title": "S&P, Nasdaq Stumble, but Dow Gains --- Decliners include consumer, technology, travel, casino stocks; Spirit jumps on bid",
  "text": "<p>Even after rallying Friday, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped for six consecutive weeks, its longest weekly losing streak since June 2011. The index is down 16% this year.</p><p>Among Monday's biggest decliners were shares of travel and casino companies. Expedia Group, Caesars Entertainment and Penn National Gaming all dropped more than 5%. The consumer discretionary and technology sectors led the S&amp;P lower.</p><p>Investors, worried that the Federal Reserve has been too late to spot the risks from soaring inflation, fear the central bank will move too aggressively to fight it, a mistake that could cause a recession.</p><p>The resulting selloff, which has been compounded by the war in Ukraine and Covid-19 lockdowns in China, has been broad, affecting most assets from cryptocurrencies and stocks to government bonds, leaving investors unsure of where to seek safety.</p><p>After weeks of losses, some investors are holding on to stocks, or buying more, hoping declines are reaching their nadir. Others are settling in for a protracted period of volatility.</p><p>\"We are moving into a more challenging time for markets. We need to see signs that inflation is not just peaking but actually decelerating before you find a sustainable bottom in the market. That is going to take at least a couple of months,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.</p><p>\"That doesn't mean we won't have counterrallies higher from day to day, but I think this is a long, drawn-out process and it is largely data-driven,\" he said.</p><p>Investors are grappling with so many issues -- the Russia-Ukraine war, Federal Reserve policy, inflation, China's economic slowdown -- it is hard for them to justify holding any assets for too long, said City Index market analyst Fawad Razaqzada. Most fundamentally, he said, investor confidence has been shaken by the selloff.</p><p>After Friday's rally, investors hope that at least a temporary bottom has been put in, several analysts said.</p><p>From a broader perspective, the changes in monetary policy and the rise in inflation have fundamentally changed the dynamic between stocks and bonds, said Evercore ISI analyst Julian Emanuel.</p><p>Stocks can still go up, he said, but because of rising bond yields, the upside for equities will be \"truncated\" as opposed to \"runaway.\"</p><p>Among individual stocks, Twitter shares fell $3.33, or 8.2%, to $37.39 after Elon Musk on Saturday said the company's legal team accused him of violating a nondisclosure agreement.</p><p>Mr. Musk Friday said that his $44 billion acquisition of the social-media company was \"on hold,\" sending the company's shares down nearly 10%.</p><p>Spirit Airlines jumped $2.29, or 13%, to $19.27 after The Wall Street Journal reported that JetBlue Airways plans to launch a hostile takeover of the discount carrier. JetBlue shares lost 61 cents, or 6.1%, to $9.45.</p><p>McDonald's shares slipped $1, or 0.4%, to $244.04 after the company said it would quit Russia and sell its business there.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 2.877% from 2.932% on Friday.</p><p>In commodities, U.S. crude oil jumped 3.4% to $114.20 a barrel. The U.S. national average price of regular gas at the pump rose to a high of $4.48 a gallon, according to AAA.</p><p>One signal investors are using to gauge a possible bottom is, surprisingly, bitcoin. The cryptocurrency careened last week amid a collapse in the stablecoin TerraUSD and is down about 35% year to date. But as bitcoin has become more tightly attached to the wider capital markets, some investors are using its movement as a gauge of speculative appetite, analysts said. Bitcoin on Monday fell 3.6% to $29,880.45.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose less than 0.1%.</p><p>In mainland China, major stock indexes fell after weaker-than-expected data showed the economic cost of strict lockdowns imposed to control Covid-19 outbreaks. Retail sales fell about 11% year over year in April, and industrial production contracted 2.9% on the same basis, while growth in fixed-asset investment slowed.</p><p>The CSI 300 Index, which tracks the 300 largest companies listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, fell 0.8%, while the broader Shanghai Composite lost 0.3%. Early Tuesday, the CSI 300 was up 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.1%.</p><p>\"The April economic numbers have confirmed investors' concerns about a China slowdown,\" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong.</p><p>Still, U.S. markets have already sold off markedly in recent weeks, partly on concerns about Chinese supply-chain disruptions, so the weak data were unlikely to have much impact on broader global markets, he said.</p><p>At midday in Tokyo, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.2%.</p><p>---</p><p>Rebecca Feng contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
