  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked down 112.24 points, or 0.3%, to 36319.98, a day after the blue-chip index notched its 44th record of 2021. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 95.81 points, or 0.6%, to 15886.54.</p><p>Some investors view Tuesday's pullback as a breather after the rally. Propelled by strong third-quarter earnings, stocks have continued to trend upward against the backdrop of supply-chain issues and concerns about inflation.</p><p>\"I don't read anything into it,\" said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer for First American Trust in California. \"That's just a natural reaction to a great eight-day run.\"</p><p>General Electric gained $2.87, or 2.7%, to $111.29 after the industrial giant said it planned to form three public companies focusing on healthcare, energy and aviation.</p><p>Tesla shares fell $139.44, or 12%, to $1,023.50 extending Monday's decline after Chief Executive Elon Musk signaled he might sell a big chunk of his stock.</p><p>\"Tesla is more of a bellwether for animal spirits in the market than it is of fundamentals and earnings projection,\" said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders, a British investment management company. Mr. Callahan said Tesla could be adding to the S&amp;P 500's decline Tuesday. \"That stock is sort of a barometer of what is the risk appetite in the market.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Roblox shares jumped $32.52, or 42%, to $109.52 after the online entertainment company said its revenues more than doubled in the third quarter.</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value hit a record, trading as high as $68,525.84, according to CoinDesk. It previously topped $66,000 in October, powered by a wave of buying after the first U.S. exchange-traded fund linked to the cryptocurrency started trading.</p><p>After faltering in early fall, stocks took off in mid-October as solid earnings bolstered investors' confidence in the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve's signals for interest rates to remain low and its position on inflation have also aided the rally, some investors say. Though some money managers remain concerned about the Fed raising rates at some point, many think stocks will continue to eke out gains. Data out Tuesday showed producer prices in October rose 0.6% from September and 8.6% on the year, signaling that inflation remains elevated.</p><p>Strong demand from consumers is powering the U.S. economy and profits at its biggest companies, said Mike Bell, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Of course that's causing some inflationary pressure, but the marketsâ€¦are buying into the Fed narrative that rates aren't going to go up too quickly,\" he added.</p><p>Mr. Bell sees two main risks: A winter rush of Covid-19 cases could put pressure on hospital systems and prompt governments to reimpose some economy-slowing restrictions. Further out, he thinks investors are underestimating the extent to which the Fed will push up interest rates to quell inflation.</p><p>Shares of AMC Entertainment, popular among individual traders, fell $5.13, or 11%, to $39.93. The cinema chain reported a loss and said attendee levels remained lower than pre-pandemic.</p><p>Meme stocks have come back into focus lately after volatile moves. \"Some of the stocks have been lit up on hopes, dreams, themes and memes,\" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, who is recommending holding small cap and value stocks.</p><p>Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the rental-car giant that emerged from bankruptcy this summer, started trading again on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Shares declined $2.83, or 9.8%, to $26.17.</p><p>Investors took a dim view of PayPal's growth outlook after company executives said they expect revenue for the final three months of the year to be lower than initially expected. Shares dived $24, or 10%, to $205.42.</p><p>Bond markets have calmed after a spell of volatility that inflicted losses on some hedge funds. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes ticked down for the third day to 1.431%, the lowest value in more than a month.</p><p>Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, gained $1.35, or 1.6% to $84.78 a barrel, its seventh-highest settle value this year.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked down 0.2%. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks' Slide Ends Eight-Day Winning Streak for S&amp;P 500</p>",
