  "text": "<p>The consortium bidding to take Kaz Minerals private has made a final offer for the London-listed copper miner as it seeks to win over minority shareholders.</p> <p>Nova Resources, which is controlled by Kaz chair Oleg Novachuk and billionaire metals tycoon Vladimir Kim, said it would pay 850p a share for the 61 per cent of the company it does not already own.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>That is up from a previous bid of 780p a share made in February and a first offer in October at 640p. </p> <p>Shareholders will also be entitled to a special dividend, paid in US dollars, of 27 cents a share, giving the final offer an aggregate value of 869p, or £4.1bn. The company's shares were up almost 3 per cent at 863.4p in mid-morning trading in London.</p> <p>Kaz decided not to declare a final dividend for 2020 when it reported annual results last month. The special special dividend is conditional on the new offer reaching a 75 per cent acceptance threshold and being declared unconditional on April 9.</p> <p>“Interestingly, the special dividend is payable to all shareholders, including Nova,” said analysts at JPMorgan.</p> <p>Commenting on the improved bid, Novachuk said Nova had listened to shareholders that had opposed the previous bids. </p> <p>He said the final offer fully reflected the change in “copper market dynamics” since its original bid. “We wanted to reflect that in the price. We have continued to listen to the market and respect its opinion.” </p> <p>To delist the Kazakh-focused copper producer, Nova needs to win approval from 75 per cent of shareholders.&#xa0;Including the shares it owns, the investment vehicle already has acceptances from nearly 60 per cent of shareholders. </p> <p>It has also received non-binding letters of intent from two hedge funds — Samson Rock Capital and Alpine Associates Management — to accept the offer. Together they own 3.17 per cent of the company.</p> <p>RWC Partners, which owns 3.1 per cent of Kaz Minerals and has publicly opposed the previous offers, said the new bid was “satisfactory”.</p> <p>“Given that this revised offer would secure our investors a price of 869p, and therefore is substantially higher than the 640p offered at the start of this protracted process, RWC believes that the revised offer is satisfactory,” it said. “Accordingly, RWC supports this third and final offer from Nova Resources.”</p> <p>Since Nova's first bid in October, copper has been on a tear and recently rose to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8305fd5-1dda-41cc-a7d2-b1476408ec43\">10-year high</a> of almost $9,500 a tonne before easing to about $8,900. The metal, used in electric vehicles and wind turbines, will play a crucial role in the shift away from fossil fuels as the world battles climate change. </p> <p>Analysts expect demand to rocket over the next decade, meaning many more new mines will be needed to avoid a supply crunch. </p> <p>That includes projects such as Baimskaya, a huge ore body in a remote part of Russia that Kaz is looking to develop. </p> <p>Baimskaya is regarded by some investors as one of the mining industry's most exciting under-developed copper prospects, even though its estimated capital expenditure has increased to roughly $8bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>In Friday's statement Nova laid out the risks to the project including potential cost blowouts, increased working capital requirements and liabilities related to long-term logistics contracts. </p> <p>“In this context, Kaz Minerals' long-term interests are best served as a private organisation,” said Novachuk.</p> <p>Tyler Broda, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the increased offer was likely to get Nova over the 75 per cent acceptance level.</p> <p>“Should Kaz not receive the 75 per cent threshold there could be a scenario where Kaz accepts a lower level of acceptances but would not be able to delist the company,” said Broda. “We think this is unlikely at this juncture and would expect the bid to be successful.”</p><p>Source: Neil Hume and Arash Massoudi 2021 'Kaz Minerals bidders raise offer to £4.1bn ' FT.com 26 March.
