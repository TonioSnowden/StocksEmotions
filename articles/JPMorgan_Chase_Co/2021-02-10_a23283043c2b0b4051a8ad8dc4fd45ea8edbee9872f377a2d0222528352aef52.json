  "text": "<p>(Little, Brown, 285 pages, $28)</p><p>Around 12 o'clock on the cold, moonlit night of Jan. 21, 1897, a 42-year-old black farmer named George Dinning, his wife, Mollie, and seven of their children were sleeping in their cabin near Price's Mill, Ky., when they were awakened by two dozen white men surrounding the house. Wielding pistols and shotguns, the mob accused Dinning of some recent thefts and ordered him to vacate his 125-acre farm, which he had purchased 20 years before from the family that had enslaved him.</p><p>When Dinning called out that he wasn't guilty, and could prove it, the men fired into the cabin, grazing him in the head and arm. Still in his underclothes, he grabbed his shotgun, ran to an upstairs window and got off a single round of birdshot, killing 32-year-old Jodie Conn, the son of a wealthy planter. The mob fired another volley and then retreated. The next morning Dinning surrendered to the Simpson County sheriff, Bud Clark. That same day, several men returned to the farm, evicted Mollie, and torched the fields, house and outbuildings. She and the children fled to relatives in Tennessee.</p><p>Kentucky (birthplace of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis) had declared neutrality in the Civil War, but racist violence was common there in the 1890s, with 10 lynchings recorded in the 13 months before the attack on George Dinning. As Ben Montgomery relates in \"A Shot in the Moonlight,\" his deeply felt, copiously researched chronicle of this episode and its repercussions, what made Dinning's case extraordinary, even more than his forceful self-defense, was his unprecedented search for justice.</p><p>Dinning was aided by a surprising number of whites, starting with Sheriff Clark, who spirited his prisoner to distant Louisville for safekeeping. Later, when Dinning was conveyed back to Simpson County to be tried for murder, many doubted that he would live to see the verdict. But Republican Gov. William Bradley, who had recently signed an anti-lynching law, dispatched two companies of soldiers to guard the accused, along with a pair of cannon.</p><p>When the trial began, in June, the prosecution witnesses admitted to being in the crowd that night but claimed that they had gone with friendly intent and were leaving when Dinning fired. The defense attorney, a local man known for fairness, seized on the implausibilities and inconsistencies in their testimony. Why would Dinning shoot if the men were dispersing? When the white jury returned, they found the defendant not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, sentencing him to seven years at hard labor.</p><p>Though relatively lenient, the verdict sparked an outcry. From across the state, public officials, newspaper editors, clergymen, professors, housewives -- white and black, ex-Yankee and ex-Confederate -- implored the governor to exercise clemency. Many commentators praised Dinning for his heroism in defending his home and argued that if he were white he never would have been charged. Others warned that the state's very honor was at stake. \"If Dinning is pardoned,\" one editor wrote, \"it will show people in the North and East that in Kentucky there is a chief executive who has the courage to see that a friendless negro obtains justice . . . that in Kentucky all citizens are treated alike.\" Gov. Bradley issued the pardon, the first in the South for a black man who killed a member of the mob that assaulted him.</p><p>The Dinning family never returned to their farm, settling in Jeffersonville, Ind. Then in September 1897, Dinning was assaulted on a dark street in nearby Louisville and left for dead, his skull fractured and his right eye gouged out. According to a witness, he had been chased by a gang of whites, but the assailants were never identified.</p><p>The following year, Dinning took a step that must have required even more courage than firing back at the night riders surrounding his house -- he filed civil suits against the men who had burned it. As Mr. Montgomery points out, it was the first time that a black man in the South had dared to sue a white mob for damages, and, like the criminal trial, it caused a sensation. In one of the cases, a jury deliberated for an hour before awarding Dinning $50,000 (though he never collected close to that amount). In another, six defendants settled for a total of $3,500.</p><p>Representing Dinning was a prominent Louisville attorney named Bennett Henderson Young. The son of a businessman and slaveholder, Young had enlisted in the Confederate army, escaped from a Yankee prison and led an audacious raid on St. Albans, Vt., the northernmost land action of the war. But afterward, back in Kentucky, he devoted himself to good works on behalf of the former slaves, representing freedmen pro bono and co-founding an orphanage and a community center for black youngsters.</p><p>Yet Young was equally dedicated to celebrating the Lost Cause. He published a book, \"Confederate Wizards of the Saddle,\" that glorified his former comrades, and as the leader of a Confederate veterans group, he helped to erect memorials to fallen rebels throughout the South. It's a remarkable paradox, and one wishes that Mr. Montgomery had examined it in greater depth. Whatever his motivations, Young pursued his dual passions until his death in 1919 -- long before his monuments started being toppled as symbols of a shameful past.</p><p>George Dinning worked as a teamster and laborer until his death in 1930. But his fearless pursuit of justice inspired other black victims to sue their white attackers, in Kentucky and beyond. Decades later, Mr. Montgomery suggests, Dinning's influence is felt still. Courage like Dinning's, he writes, \"inspired the men and women who fought for the right to vote, who fought for equal treatment, who fought against Black Codes and Jim Crow, who fought the Second Klan, . . . who fought against government persecution and police prosecution, who fought for liberty, who are still fighting, chanting 'Black Lives Matter.'\" George Dinning's memorials may be less concrete than Bennett Young's, but they are proving more durable.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Helferich's most recent book is \"An Unlikely Trust: Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan, and the Improbable Partnership That Remade American Business.\"</p>",
