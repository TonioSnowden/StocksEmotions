  "title": "Banking & Finance: Financial ETF Rebounds",
  "text": "<p>ETFs tracking the S&amp;P 500's technology, communication, consumer-discretionary and health-care sectors surpassed their pre-Covid-19 highs last year. But many cyclical groups, including financials, had lagged behind the broader stock market's recovery as investors favored buying shares of fast-growing companies. Since the November elections, though, the investment tides have shifted toward economically sensitive companies amid expectations of heavy spending by Democrats, which investors expect will help boost growth.</p><p>Investors have sought to increase their exposure to bank stocks by putting money into the Financial Select Sector ETF for 11 straight weeks. Flows so far in January have reached $3.6 billion, already exceeding every full-month total since November 2016, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.</p><p>But some investors might not realize that the ETF is essentially a wager on the success of a few of the biggest financial stocks in the S&amp;P 500. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. account for about a quarter of the fund, while the addition of Bank of America Corp. increases the collective weighting of the three stocks to roughly 33%. It is no surprise then that the ETF's return to record levels coincided with a rally in those stocks.</p><p>The index on which the ETF is based is market-cap weighted, meaning bigger companies have more influence, just like in the broader S&amp;P 500 index. Shares of JPMorgan, which carry a 12% weighting in the ETF, hit a record $141.17 last week ahead of the bank's reporting its highest-ever quarterly profit. Berkshire hit its own record high last week.</p><p>Big banks on Wednesday wrapped up fourth-quarter earnings season: Overall, the pandemic has proved profitable for most banks after many released some of the reserves they had set aside at the pandemic's onset. But low interest rates continued to eat into performance.</p><p>Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and Bank of America are bullish on financial stocks this year, while Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA, said the research firm has \"buy\" ratings on more than a third of the stocks in the sector.</p><p>Smaller bank and financial stocks have also been rallying. Shares of more than a dozen companies in the sector, including Raymond James Financial Inc., First Republic Bank and Ameriprise Financial Inc., have hit record highs this year.</p><p>That has helped push up an ETF that equally weighs all of the components in the financial-services sector, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF, ahead of its market-cap weighted version by more than 2 percentage points over the past three months, according to FactSet. That gap had widened over the past week as shares of big banks plateaued, or even fell, despite reporting mostly upbeat earnings results.</p><p>Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, said the strong pace of gains across regional banks in recent months might be hard to keep up due to a more muted earnings recovery. Low interest rates will continue to stifle net interest income, or what banks earn from the loans they give out, she said. Unlike most regional banks, the big banks have various other businesses, such as capital markets, to offset that.</p><p>Regions Financial Corp. and Huntington Bancshares Inc., whose results are due Friday, and Raymond James Financial, due Wednesday, are among the regional banks whose quarterly reports investors will parse in the coming days.</p><p>\"The regional-bank earnings recovery may take a little longer and that may put pressure on the industry, which has had a strong run in the 2 1/2 months ahead of the reporting period,\" said Ms. Bell.</p>",
