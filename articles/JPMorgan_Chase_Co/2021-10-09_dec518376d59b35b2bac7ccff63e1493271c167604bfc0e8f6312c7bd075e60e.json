  "text": "<p>Edward D. Miller grew up in Brooklyn's rough Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. His early jobs included bartending and selling pretzels on the streets. After studying engineering at Brooklyn College for two years, he dropped out and took a clerical job at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, known as Manny Hanny.</p><p>With neither a business degree nor Ivy League polish, he might have seemed unlikely to go far in New York banking. After serving in the U.S. Marines in the early 1960s, however, Mr. Miller returned to Manny Hanny and joined a management-training program. At the age of 29, he was promoted to overhaul the company's credit-card business. Success there led to a series of promotions.</p><p>Mr. Miller played a central role in combining some of the nation's largest banks after the 1991 merger of Manny Hanny and Chemical Banking and the 1995 combination of those banks and Chase Manhattan. He was senior vice chairman of the new Chase, now part of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>He credited his early studies in engineering for teaching him to develop processes rather than relying on improvisation. The Marines, he said, gave him a sense of how to create teamwork among a diverse group of people in stressful circumstances.</p><p>Mr. Miller died Sept. 26 at his home in Jupiter, Fla. He was 80 and had been under treatment for cancer.</p>",
