  "text": "<p>US banks have waited more than a year for consumer lending to recover. Loan growth at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5fa2ba2-1fdf-4a55-a500-fdb0e7cba8e6\">JPMorgan Chase</a> suggests they will have to go on waiting.</p> <p>America's largest bank kicked off the third-quarter earnings season on Wednesday by comfortably beating analyst expectations. Profits were almost a quarter higher than a year ago. Strong investment banking revenues, along with the release of more than $2bn in loan-loss reserves, offset a slowdown in bond trading. All told, return on equity came in at an impressive 18 per cent.</p> <p>But loan growth remains a sore point. Total loans grew 6 per cent during the quarter. But dig past the headline figure and it is clear this growth was driven by the bank's asset and wealth management division. Consumer and commercial borrowing growth — the lifeblood of traditional banking — remains elusive. Loans shrank 2 per cent and 5 per cent year-on-year respectively. </p> <p>Americans have not given up shopping. At JPMorgan, credit card spending jumped 30 per cent during the third quarter. But consumers are opting to pay down their card balances rather than incur interest payments, resulting in a 21 per cent drop in income from the business. Home lending shows the same pattern. Mortgage fees and income are down by almost half amid a surge in refinancing.</p> <p>JPMorgan says that the picture for lending is improving. That may not fulfil investor optimism about a recovery that has helped big bank stocks to stage a dramatic rally this year. Its share price fell more than 2 per cent. The KBW Bank index has soared 70 per cent over the past 12 months, well ahead of the S&amp;P 500's 24 per cent. The sector's valuation —&#xa0; at 1.8 times tangible book — is near a five-year high. </p> <p>The bull case for banks rests on the notion that rising interest rates and the return of consumer loan activity will help to revive net interest income. Without a pick-up in loan growth, the sector does not look like much of a bargain.</p><p>Source:  2021 'JPMorgan: muted loan growth takes air out of bank sector rally ' FT.com 13 October.
