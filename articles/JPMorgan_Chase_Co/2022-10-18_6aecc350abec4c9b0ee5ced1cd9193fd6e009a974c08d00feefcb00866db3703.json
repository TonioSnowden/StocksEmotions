  "text": "<p>\"The customers' resilience and health remain strong,\" Mr. Moynihan said Monday on a call with analysts after the company reported its third-quarter earnings.</p><p>Executives and everyday Americans alike are trying to figure out the uncertain economic outlook. The highest inflation in decades has prompted the Federal Reserve to aggressively lift interest rates to slow the economy.</p><p>Like other lenders, Bank of America is preparing by stowing away additional money to cover possible loan defaults. The $378 million the bank added to its reserves was a drag on its earnings.</p><p>Bank of America earned $7.08 billion in the latest period, down 8% from $7.69 billion a year earlier. That amounts to 81 cents a share. Analysts expected 78 cents, according to FactSet. Revenue rose 8% to $24.5 billion. Analysts expected $23.54 billion.</p><p>Still, Mr. Moynihan, the longtime head of the nation's second-largest bank, has stood out in recent years for having a sanguine outlook on the economy. He was early to say the economy was rebounding from the pandemic shutdown in 2020. At the time, many banking executives feared widespread customer defaults, which never materialized.</p><p>Mr. Moynihan's remarks Monday stand in contrast to other big-bank CEOs, namely JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s Jamie Dimon, who reiterated his belief on Friday that an economic \"hurricane\" is coming. JPMorgan executives said consumers will deplete the extra money in their checking accounts around the middle of next year.</p><p>Despite Mr. Moynihan's optimism, there were some notes of caution. Spending growth, while high, slowed to 10% in September, versus 12% for the year so far, according to the bank's metrics.</p><p>Mr. Moynihan said at an industry conference last week that his bank expects a shallow recession with a modest increase in unemployment. Economists widely expect a recession in the next 12 months, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.</p><p>Meanwhile, higher rates are boosting banks' lending businesses. Bank of America's net interest income jumped 24% to $13.77 billion.</p><p>Noninterest income fell 8% to $10.74 billion. A deal-making drought caused investment-banking fees to fall 46% to $1.17 billion. Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street banks reported similar declines.</p><p>Trading revenue rose 13% to $4.11 billion during a turbulent quarter for markets.</p><p>Swooning financial markets also prompted wealthy people to pare their borrowing for the first time in years last quarter. Until recently, wealthy people were taking out securities-based loans at a rapid pace, even when markets plunged in the first half of this year. Those are loans backed by assets like stock-and-bond portfolios.</p><p>At Bank of America, those loans dropped by almost 3% over the third quarter, to $52.6 billion. That was the first quarter-over-quarter drop since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>",
