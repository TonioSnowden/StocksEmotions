  "title": "Derby's Take: Fed May Seek to Tamp Down Talk of Very Aggressive Rate Rises; Several Fed officials have cast doubt on need for 75 basis point rate increase",
  "text": "<p>The Fed is so behind the curve in trying to keep inflation in check that there has been rampant speculation the central bank would need to raise rates this week by more than 50 basis points. Even an increase of that size will be a fairly radical action for a central bank that has long preferred quarter percentage point increases. The last time the Fed approved a 50 basis point increase was in May 2000.</p><p>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard put the idea of a 75 basis point rate increase into play. Mr. Bullard was one of the first policy makers to argue in favor of the Fed shifting monetary policy to tackle inflation and for ending the extraordinary levels of stimulus the central bank provided in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. He even voted in favor of a 50 basis point move at the March FOMC meeting while his colleagues opted for a quarter percentage point increase.</p><p>In a recent public appearance, Mr. Bullard noted the Fed boosted its target rate by 75 basis points as part of its super aggressive tightening effort of 1994. The Fed raised the federal-funds rate from 3% at the start of that year to 5.5% by its end, capped by a 75 basis point increase in November 1994.</p><p>That aggressive chapter in monetary policy was successful and \"set up the U.S. economy for a stellar second half of the 1990s, one of the best periods in U.S. macroeconomic history,\" Mr. Bullard said on April 18.</p><p>Mr. Bullard, however, said he probably won't formally vote for a 75 basis point increase, and several other Fed officials have also expressed doubts that such a large move is necessary.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday \"will probably try to avoid giving much concrete guidance about the size of future rate hikes, but he certainly won't push back on the idea that additional half-point moves might be on the table at upcoming meetings,\" Wrightson ICAP analysts wrote in a note to clients this past weekend.</p><p>\"The Fed began the year stressing the need to be 'nimble'; it now wants to be 'methodical' in getting rates 'expeditiously' back to neutral by year-end,\" the analysts added.</p><p>Economists believe the Fed could try to set expectations for future rate rises that stay along a path of half percentage point increases. How the Fed describes its rate outlook in its policy statement will be important, according to Michael Feroli, an economist with J.P. Morgan. He wrote in a research note that if the Fed says it \"anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,\" it will leave open the size of future moves, which could include quarter percentage point increases.</p><p>But if the Fed statement draws on language some officials have used lately to describe the rate outlook and warns that it will \"continue to expeditiously remove accommodation,\" or something along those lines, that would be a strong hint that 50 basis point moves will be the default setting going forward, Mr. Feroli wrote.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
