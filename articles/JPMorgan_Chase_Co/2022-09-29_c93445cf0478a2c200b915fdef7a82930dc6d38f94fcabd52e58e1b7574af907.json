  "text": "<p>The CFPB said Regions employed \"counterintuitive, complex transaction processing\" that made it hard for consumers to understand or reasonably avoid paying fees.</p><p>Regions, based in Birmingham, Ala., will pay a $50 million penalty to the CFPB and will refund customers around $141 million for these so-called authorized-positive overdraft fees.</p><p>The bank didn't admit or deny the CFPB's findings as part of the settlement.</p><p>Regions said in an email that it disagreed with the CFPB's characterizations but that it is pleased to move forward.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have pressed banks to cut back on overdraft charges.</p><p>Following scrutiny from regulators and politicians, banks including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. made changes to their overdraft practices.</p><p>Black households and those with low to moderate incomes are almost twice as likely to incur overdraft fees as white households or those with higher incomes, according to a report from the Financial Health Network, a research firm partly funded by financial institutions.</p>",
