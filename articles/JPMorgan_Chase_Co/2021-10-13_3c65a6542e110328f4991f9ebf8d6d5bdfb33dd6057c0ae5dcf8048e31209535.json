  "text": "<p>Stock indexes have been dragged lower in choppy trading in recent weeks. Investors are contending with an energy crunch that threatens to add to inflationary pressures just as signs emerge that global economic growth is slowing.</p><p>\"Investors are running around like chickens with their heads cut off,\" said John Buckingham, portfolio manager at Kovitz. \"They focus on one thing at a time and buy and then change their mind and sell.\"</p><p>Communications stocks led losses among the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, declining more than 1%. Google parent Alphabet slid $49.30, or 1.8%, to $2,728.98 and Facebook fell $1.68, or 0.5%, to $323.77. Steeply rising bond yields and regulation issues have dragged down tech shares in recent sessions.</p><p>Those losses were offset by gains among real estate and consumer discretionary stocks. MGM Resorts International rose $4.27, or 9.6%, to $48.69, its highest close since 2008, after Credit Suisse more than doubled its price target for the company. Other entertainment stocks joined the rally with Caesars Entertainment and Las Vegas Sands both adding around 2%.</p><p>General Motors said it would recover from supplier LG Electronics Inc. nearly all of the $2 billion cost of recalling Chevrolet Bolt electric models for the risk of battery fires. GM Shares rose 87 cents, or 1.5%, to $58.96.</p><p>Third-quarter earnings season, which begins this week, will provide clues on how companies are faring with price increases. Some of the U.S.'s biggest financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, are set to kick off the reporting season Wednesday.</p><p>\"The main topic will be inflation, there is some real concern about a winter of discontent,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy for Mediolanum International Funds. \"We could see some volatility if companies don't get their communications right on their cost pressures.\"</p><p>Oil prices waffled in volatile trading but held near multiyear highs.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, gained 12 cents a barrel, or 0.1%, to $80.64 a barrel, its highest settlement value in nearly seven years.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark, lost 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $83.42 a barrel. Crude prices have been on an extended climb in recent weeks amid a world-wide shortage of natural gas.</p><p>Concerns about disappointing economic data also have increased for investors.</p><p>U.S. data showed job openings dropped to 10.4 million, missing forecasts of 10.9 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth forecast for the world economy for this year, citing supply-chain disruptions in rich economies and global-health concerns caused by the spread of the contagious Covid-19 Delta variant.</p><p>\"There is a tone of worry on the data front, and that's been the factor that hasn't really turned around yet. We haven't seen any strong reports that suggest that this is just a temporary Delta variant driven slowdown,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager and head of multiasset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note was little changed at 1.579%. Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, have been on an upward trajectory since the Federal Reserve signaled last month it could start tapering its bond purchases as soon as November.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index declined less than 0.1%.</p><p>Concerns about China's struggling real-estate sector continued.</p><p>Two board members of embattled developer Fantasia resigned, days after the company failed to make a $206 million bond payment. Its troubles add to worries that China's property sector difficulties extend beyond China Evergrande, whose failure to meet its debt payments raised concerns about a fresh drag on the world's second-biggest economy.</p><p>Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei was down 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.3%.</p>",
