A black turtleneck-clad Son took to a stage in Tokyo <a href=\"https://group.softbank/en/event/earnings_2020q4#1\">to present to investors over livestream</a> his latest batch of <a href=\"https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/presentations/2020/earnings-presentation_q4fy2020_01_en.pdf\">unique PowerPoint slides</a>.</p> <p>But his appearance comes against a sharp downturn in technology stocks in recent days that hasn't spared SoftBank's shares. It is a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes change in the market and why it is never possible to settle on a simplistic view of SoftBank's performance.&#xa0;</p> <p>One thing, however, can always be counted upon. And that's Son's taste for traders and trades that defy expectations.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's in that context that SoftBank this week struck <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d8962cf-6ea9-49c0-8c0f-9abae4afa59a\">a series of deals</a>, including a $730m investment, with UK-based ecommerce group <strong>THG</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Alongside the equity investment — noteworthy becomes it comes just eight months after THG tapped stock market investors during its initial public offering in London — was a second arrangement agreed between the companies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c\"><strong>SB Northstar</strong></a>, a unit of SoftBank that Son created last year to manage its public equities investments, is getting a free option to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in a division of THG called <strong>Ingenuity</strong> for $1.6bn.</p> <p>The ecommerce outsourcing unit had just £137m in sales last year. The hypothetical option places a huge valuation of $6bn on Ingenuity and implies that the sum of the parts valuation on which THG presently trades on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ad84653-e32d-4249-bfb4-b33c88ce4569\">is far too low</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The power of revealing the option arrangement alongside the equity funding is that shares in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad173723-47a5-4d44-8cd0-1b5e11c44db6\">THG soared on the news</a>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The key architect behind this nifty bit of dealmaking is <strong>Akshay Naheta</strong>, a former <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>trader who runs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c\">SB Northstar</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>He's the focus of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b29f452a-40c4-4f62-b193-d0c90af84bfe\">this profile piece</a> which also looks in-depth at the THG deal by DD's Arash Massoudi and Rob Smith, and the FT's Jonathan Eley.</p> <p>The complex structure of the deal is signature Naheta, who has overseen some of the group's most complex and controversial trades including the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2\"><strong>Nasdaq</strong> whale</a> and one tied to the now-disgraced German payments company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8eec9d0-0c85-467d-8cb1-467ad87adced\"><strong>Wirecard</strong></a>.</p> <p>It is also a sign of his growing influence at SoftBank as he steps out from the shadow of his mentor <strong>Rajeev Misra</strong> — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71ad7cda-6ef4-11e8-92d3-6c13e5c92914\">one of Son's top lieutenants</a> and a fellow Deutsche Bank alum who recruited Naheta back in 2017.</p> <p>“Akshay's stock has risen quite a lot. He's proven himself to be highly adept and now speaks to Masa frequently,” one person who knows both men told DD's Arash Massoudi.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The key thing is that he's like Rajeev's adopted son. He's really mentored him and brought him in. They may have disagreements but Rajeev loves to be a player-coach.”</p> <h2>The ‘SoftBank of Africa' has a multi-billion-dollar value problem</h2> <p><strong>Naspers</strong> has one of the best problems to have in financial markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>The South African internet group is famous for having made a $32m bet in 2001 on an obscure Chinese start-up.&#xa0;</p> <p>Twenty years later, its 28 per cent stake in<strong> Tencent</strong> is valued at $210bn — an epic return that has led many to dub it “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47b1a8fa-a7a3-11e9-b6ee-3cdf3174eb89\">Africa's SoftBank</a>”, a call back to the Japanese conglomerate's winning bet on <strong>Alibaba</strong>. But Naspers itself is still only worth $100bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's the simple reason for a complex manoeuvre Naspers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd84b50c-219d-45c1-b734-a0becdd5c9a1\">announced on Wednesday</a> to swap nearly half of its ordinary N shares for those of <strong>Prosus</strong>, an Amsterdam-listed investment unit that holds the Tencent stake and other assets, writes the FT's Joseph Cotterill in a DD dispatch from Johannesburg.</p> <p>Naspers is just too big for its bourse, the company says. As Tencent's share price keeps rocketing, Naspers keeps dominating the Johannesburg stock market and forcing South African investors to sell, adding to the discount.</p> <p>And not for the first time — Prosus was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daa5ddc2-942d-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2\">created in 2019</a> to deal with this very problem. Worth about $170bn, it trades at a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13219d5e-4f04-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294\">lower discount</a>.</p> <p>This time round, a share swap will cut Naspers down to size, but keep it in control of Prosus and give investors more than $100bn of the newly doubled Prosus free float to play with.&#xa0;</p> <p>Already Europe's biggest listed internet company, deal-hungry Prosus is likely to become even more of a M&amp;A machine. (And after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00935372-f4e9-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6\">three failed bids</a> for the UK's Just Eat several years ago, the group's latest share-swapping deal will potentially up its shareholder appeal.)<br></p> <p>Naspers and Prosus' chief executive <strong>Bob van Dijk</strong> and chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/facee384-d094-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6\"><strong>Koos Bekker</strong></a> have<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af7e20b2-00c0-476e-b145-44fbcdd48ee2\"> signalled</a> ambitions to chase more acquisitions for its digital emerging-markets empire, extending across Indian online payments, South American food delivery and Russian social media.</p> <p>Yet Naspers remains a complex beast for investors. Working on the discount is a nice dilemma for the group to find itself in, but it's also one that probably won't go away anytime soon.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Matt King</strong> has resigned as chief executive of US bookmaker <strong>FanDuel</strong> after four years in the role. FanDuel's parent company <strong>Flutter</strong> said his departure could stall <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb0cf9a4-3079-4a41-a18e-b2a2e67e9b36\">potential plans</a> to partially float the gambling group on the American market.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has appointed <strong>Tim Devine</strong> as a managing director and co-head of Financial Institutions Group. He joins the Chicago office after serving as head of speciality finance in the Americas within FIG banking at <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> has hired <strong>David Ibáñez </strong>as managing director within its Emea technology group. He was previously a managing director in <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>'s technology, media and telecoms unit.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Jones Day </strong>has hired <strong>Amy Kläsener </strong>and <strong>Michael Lundberg </strong>as partners in its global disputes practice.

He joins from <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Behind the velvet rope </strong>Perhaps the most exclusive men's club in history aside from the Vatican has been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1146Z:SW\">Banque Pictet &amp; Cie</a>, a secretive Swiss bank for the point-one per cent.
