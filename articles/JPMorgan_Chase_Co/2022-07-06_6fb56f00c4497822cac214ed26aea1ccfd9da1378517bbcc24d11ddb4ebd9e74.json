  "text": "<p>The crypto market has seen more than $2 trillion worth of valuation disappear as the price of bitcoin, ether and most other cryptocurrencies has plunged. The early-May collapse of the Terra platform erased $60 billion worth of tokens and started a chain reaction through hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital Ltd. and lenders like Celsius Network LLC, Voyager Digital Ltd., and BlockFi Inc.</p><p>Vauld, which has about 800,000 users mainly in Asia, was the latest party to experience trouble. On Monday, it suspended withdrawals, disclosing that users had pulled almost $200 million over the past three weeks. The company had laid off 30% of its staff and said it was looking into its alternatives, including a restructuring.</p><p>Founded in 2018, Vauld raised $25 million in Series A funding last summer, attracting funds from Valar Ventures, which was founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, as well as Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures. In a press release, Nexo, which has about four million users, compared current conditions to the U.S. banking crisis of 1907, a time before the creation of the Federal Reserve when markets didn't have a so-called lender of last resort.</p><p>That panic subsided only after J.P. Morgan and associates injected private capital in the market. Recently, the billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried has made a number of deals that have drawn the comparison to Morgan. Nexo put itself in that category as well.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
