  "text": "<p>Jamie Dimon was in London last week. Among other priorities, JPMorgan's chief executive was giving a shot in the arm to the US banking giant's latest expansion drive — the rollout of its retail banking brand in the UK, via an online-only initiative.</p> <p>JP's swaggering global ambitions contrast starkly with the diminished outlook of many European banks. Over recent months, the roll-call of lenders from across the continent opting to give up on US operations has lengthened. </p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-bnp-hires-advisers-explore-15-bln-bank-west-sale-sources-2021-11-15/\">it emerged</a> that France's BNP was seeking to sell San Francisco-based Bank of the West. A year ago Spain's BBVA <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42a97547-d857-465d-afd3-7f5b7c9c4d74\">sold its American unit</a> to PNC. Over the summer, HSBC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d51df836-092b-4b6e-9b50-b5e8e6c98d96\">divested the bulk</a> of its US operations to Citizens.</p> <p>Citizens itself was owned by RBS (now NatWest) for almost 30 years until the UK group's collapse and bailout forced a sale six years ago.</p> <p>Independence from a foreign owner, especially a weak one, has proved a liberating experience. With a stock market listing of its own, Citizens, under the leadership of Bruce Van Saun (previously RBS's finance director), has been able to attract high-quality bankers who wouldn't have considered working for a subsidiary of a British group.</p> <p>It is partly about rewards. Stock-based remuneration is based on a more direct influence on the fortunes of the business. There is no risk of losing out on capital allocation from headquarters in London or Edinburgh. </p> <p>At the same time Citizens has engaged in targeted expansion — into commercial banking, M&amp;A and basic investment banking services. As a whole it has added up to a return on tangible common equity — a benchmark of profitability — of close to <a href=\"https://investor.citizensbank.com/~/media/Files/C/CitizensBank-IR/reports-and-presentations/3q21-earnings-release.pdf\">14 per cent</a> at the last count, more than double the tally when it was spun out of RBS and not far off JPMorgan's <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2021/3rd-quarter/3983239a-3b6f-4e6b-a52f-6ce651dfd70f.pdf\">18 per cent</a>.</p> <p>The fortunes of US operations under European ownership have been less inspiring. Many foreign banks have been drawn by the size of the US market and margins that tend to be fatter than back home, not to mention an economy that has looked in better fettle for years. </p> <p>But none has been able to claim the scale necessary to mount a credible business to compete with nationwide players such as JPMorgan or Bank of America. The advent of fintechs has added to the competitive challenge. Regulatory compliance costs — far higher post-2008 — have, meanwhile, proved disproportionately burdensome for smaller groups.</p> <p>The net result? European banks have underperformed, having attracted second-tier staff, second-rate clients, and what a former bank boss calls a “serious negative selection issue” on strategy.</p> <p>For one European lender, that is almost part of the strategy. Santander's subprime car loans business, Scusa, has grown dramatically in recent years, picking up customers spurned by mainstream banks. An added boost has come thanks to the cash windfalls distributed as part of the US Covid-19 relief programme, which have prompted millions of families to splash out on items including cars.</p> <p>Santander's US operation has quietly overtaken the likes of Spain, Brazil and the UK to become the top profit contributor to the group: it generated €2.8bn of pre-tax profit out of a group-wide €11.4bn in the<a href=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/resultados-trimestrales/2021/3q/rt-3T-2021-informe-financiero-en.pdf\"> first nine months </a>of the year. As things stand, the Spanish group looks like a significant exception to the broader European trend of failure and withdrawal, with plans instead to expand further.</p> <p>Some rivals argue that problems are brewing. At the peak of a debt cycle, there is a danger that defaults, particularly among subprime borrowers, will shoot up. The subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-8 showed the potential dangers in this area. The group was last year forced to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-lending-idUSKBN22V2GS\">strike a $550m settlement </a>with US authorities after being accused of aggressive lending practices, though current management point to reformed practices.</p> <p>Another criticism made of Santander's US operation is that it comprises a hotchpotch of units: in addition to the subprime consumer lender and an investment banking arm, it owns a wealth manager in Miami and a low-profit retail banking operation in Boston. The synergies should, though, be boosted in the coming months: a plan to buy out the listed 20 per cent minority of the consumer lender will allow deposits to be recycled freely to back the car loans business. Ana Botín, Santander's hard-charging executive chair, began her career as a banker at JPMorgan. Whether long term she can really buck European banks' pattern of US ignominy, and emulate a little of Jamie Dimon's success, is an open question.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:patrick.jenkins@ft.com\"><em>patrick.jenkins@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Patrick Jenkins 2021 'Why European banks have failed to crack the US' FT.com 22 November.
