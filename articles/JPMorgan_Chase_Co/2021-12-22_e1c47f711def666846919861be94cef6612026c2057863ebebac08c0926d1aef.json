  "title": "BNP Paribas lays down markers of its investment banking ambitions",
  "text": "<p>When Covid-19 sparked widespread shutdowns in Europe last year, one bank cropped up more than most as a lender providing cash to jittery companies across the region.</p> <p>“You'd be offering to take a €100m slice of a loan and BNP Paribas would come in and say: ‘I'll do it all',” said one senior executive at a US bank in Paris. “They made the most of a moment when they had room to manoeuvre, which was the right thing to do.”</p> <p>This lending push is one of several markers BNP has laid down in its increasingly conspicuous drive to do what few rivals aspire to these days: become the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/627282f7-b920-48f6-88a7-09b967ba775d\">go-to European investment bank</a> for clients, not just in the region but around the world. </p> <p>Fresh from gains this year in areas where it was not previously a high-flyer, including advising on stock market listings, BNP wants to show this is not just a pandemic one-off linked to nervous rivals hitting pause on lending in 2020.</p> <p>While it announced this week that it was getting out of US retail banking, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8cd3541-8869-4ef7-ac96-f0c528edbc02\">selling its Bank of the West operation to Bank of Montreal for $16.3bn</a>, it wants to round out its New York presence in advisory as it tries to woo companies considering transatlantic business, according to people familiar with its plans. </p> <p>It also aims to invest further in its Exane research and brokerage business, possibly also in the US, the people said. At the same time, it has expanded its prime broking business that serves hedge funds, taking on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31905026-18bb-4fea-bcda-86ad22e13ae7\">client referrals from Credit Suisse</a> and absorbing the Deutsche Bank prime business it bought two years ago. </p> <p>However, the experience of European rivals with grand expansion plans provides some cautionary tales on overextending.</p> <p>Credit Suisse, for example, is in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f51d236-6f9c-4222-bc7e-9a5073696883\">midst of a major restructuring</a>, sparked by losses at its prime broking business after the collapse of family office Archegos<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f51d236-6f9c-4222-bc7e-9a5073696883\">.</a> It was one of a number of European banks, from UBS to Deutsche, that 10 years ago was jostling to compete as global players with dominant US investment banks such as JPMorgan. </p> <p>A decade on, all of them have shrunk their US presence, while the two Swiss banks decided to focus more on wealth management. </p> <p>BNP Paribas was never really part of that group. Long perceived as a solid, reliable commercial bank, it is the EU's largest listed bank, with roughly a fifth of its €2.5tn balance sheet made up of French assets. It was seen as lacking the panache of rivals, which are known for recruiting the deal “rainmakers” sought after by governments and chief executives for advice. </p> <p>People who work there have said this belied years of gradual expansion, with hires and acquisitions at BNP's investment bank long predating the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>“This has been built up over time and clients noticed well before rivals or analysts,” said Yann Gérardin, a BNP veteran who has run its corporate and institutional banking unit since 2014. BNP's chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé has been at the helm for the past decade. </p> <p>Had the pandemic struck several years earlier, BNP might not have pushed as hard as it did to lend to clients from the UK to Germany, when it did not have as wide a range of other services to offer, Gérardin said.</p> <p>“It's like a Swiss watch. All the pieces of the clockwork need to fit together. The watch was ready.”&#xa0;</p> <p>BNP is particularly keen to stress its improved standing in equity capital markets. Its roll call of mandates include a rights issue for Cellnex, a Spanish mobile phone tower operator, and the stock market spin-off of Daimler's trucks business. &#xa0;</p> <p>Hires in markets where it was largely absent as an investment bank even three years ago, such as the Nordics, have yielded equity placements there too.</p> <p>During the pandemic, it capitalised on US banks focusing on their domestic market, coming third place in the investment bank revenue league tables for Emea last year. This year however US rivals are back on the offensive and in the year to mid-December BNP had fallen back to sixth place with a 4.4 per cent share of revenues, according to Dealogic.</p> <p>“They have definitely succeeded in taking market share, but it's been a gradual build,” said Jon Peace, an analyst at Credit Suisse. </p> <p>BNP executives said it was not pursuing an expansion of its investment bank for its own sake, but to stay relevant to corporate clients that were increasingly turning to public markets rather than banks for funding. </p> <p>Some critics have said that by extending its balance sheet as it woos clients, BNP has taken on too much risk and last month global regulators at the Financial Stability Board ordered it to increase its capital buffers by 0.5 percentage points by 2023.</p> <p>The FSB, which monitors systemically important banks, moved BNP into the third of its five categories of banks, based on the amount of reserves they need to cover losses in a downturn. JPMorgan is the only bank ranked higher in terms of its exposure, according to the FSB.</p> <p>By its own admission, BNP still lags behind rivals in areas such as mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>Some peers question whether it can make a meaningful mark here, but it has hired around 100 junior and 30 senior advisory specialists this year alone in areas such as healthcare and infrastructure. More hires are expected to follow next year, including a handful in the US, two people familiar with the plans said. </p> <p>“Their ambitions are not completely mad,” said one recent joiner. He said he took a pay cut to take the job, but was persuaded by the bank's stability and its willingness to invest. </p> <p>BNP has also said it had other overlooked assets. When it was hired to advise on a private equity buyout of UK supermarket Wm Morrison this year, it was partly thanks to another one of its businesses, a real estate arm that provides warehouse services, including for supermarkets.</p> <p>The coming year will be a major test of BNP's renewed drive, with a strategy day in February. It will have fully absorbed Deutsche's prime broking business, and hopes this will help it to generate more revenues from institutional customers and hedge funds. Its acquisition of Deutsche's electronic equities division has also given it a technological edge.</p> <p>Some rivals remain sceptical. “They have the platform, [and] they will be fine on the technology and on pricing as they have a massive balance sheet. But the question is on the relationship side and challenges to get in the room with the people who make the decisions,” said one competitor. </p> <p>However, according to one shareholder: “They are in a good place. But everyone is waiting for the strategy update for more details.”</p><p>Source: Sarah White in Paris and Owen Walker in London 2021 'BNP Paribas lays down markers of its investment banking ambitions' FT.com 22 December.
