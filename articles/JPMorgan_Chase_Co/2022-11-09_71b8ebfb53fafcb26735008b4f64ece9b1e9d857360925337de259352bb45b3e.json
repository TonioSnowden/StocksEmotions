  "text": "<p>The danger is obvious: There's no one big enough to rescue Binance.</p><p>Many, including my colleague Justin Baer, have compared the deal to the 2008 rescue of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan. But that relied on help from the Federal Reserve, something impossible in the freewheeling government-free world of crypto.</p><p>A better comparison may be the 1907 Wall Street panic, when John Pierpont Morgan, JPMorgan founder, corralled New York's bankers to provide enough money to restore confidence and end bank runs. Back then there was no Federal Reserve, and there was no one big enough to rescue JPMorgan had it run into trouble. Luckily it didn't, partly because Mr. Morgan loomed larger than life over American finance.</p><p>But there's an obvious danger of relying on a single person, even Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ. After all, until this week it was Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX founder, who was lauded as a modern-day J.P. Morgan for his rescues of smaller crypto crashes.</p><p>Back in 1907 the need to rely on Mr. Morgan and his colleagues in what was labeled a \"money trust\" was the catalyst needed to start the process of setting up a central bank. The Fed was created by law six years later with a mandate to supervise banks and lend against good assets, among other things.</p><p>It's impossible to create a central bank of cryptoland, because the whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they are independent of the government.</p><p>\"If you go there, you're on your own,\" Stefan Ingves, governor of Sweden's Riksbank, the world's oldest central bank, told me on Wednesday.</p><p>This leaves crypto with no backstop against banklike runs if there's a loss of confidence in its exchanges, which are really a combination of banks and brokerages, many with little or no regulation. The exchanges themselves often make things worse by being secretive about the risks they are taking, while reusing customer assets to boost profits. But even if they were perfectly transparent, they can't avoid a run so long as they don't have the ready cash to repay in full customers who lose faith and pull their assets.</p><p>The problem here isn't crypto in itself. If everyone hewed to the suggestion made by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in crypto's 2008 founding document, all would be fine (if much less exciting). Nakamoto set out the case for a decentralized, trustless blockchain where everyone held their own account and transactions were verified by anyone who wanted to take part. The trouble with the bitcoin Nakamoto created is that transactions are slow, expensive and hard to scale up.</p><p>Instead the crypto boom has largely led to customers trading and holding crypto on exchanges, avoiding the need to interact directly with the blockchains.</p><p>The reliance on trust that Nakamoto was trying to avoid has been reintroduced—and one of the biggest lessons of financial history is that where there's a need for trust, there are also dire consequences when trust breaks down. Mr. Bankman-Fried experienced that firsthand this week as his attempts to reassure clients were ignored.</p><p>For now CZ's intervention holds out the hope of some stability for FTX and the broader crypto ecosystem. It's impossible to say how long it might last, if the deal even goes through. But the fundamental flaw of centralized finance is that it needs central banks to end chaotic bank runs, and crypto has reinvented centralized finance.</p><p>Write to James Mackintosh at james.mackintosh@wsj.com</p><p>Crypto Reinvented Centralized Finance—but Forgot the Central Bank</p>",
