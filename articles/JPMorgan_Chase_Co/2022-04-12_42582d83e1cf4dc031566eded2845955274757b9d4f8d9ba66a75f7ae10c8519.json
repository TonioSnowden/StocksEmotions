  "text": "<p>Ukraine's finance minister has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46622383-d75c-4a08-b909-fbf1279b3814\">made an appeal for immediate financial support</a> of tens of billions of dollars to plug a gaping fiscal deficit caused by the Russian invasion.</p> <p>Government spending exceeded revenues by about $2.7bn in March and Ukraine expects the gap to expand to $5bn-$7bn a month in April and May. </p> <p>“We are under great stress, in the very worst [financial] condition,” Sergii Marchenko said in an interview with the Financial Times. “Now it is a question of the survival of our country. If you want us to continue fighting this war, to win this war . . . then help us.”</p> <p>Marchenko painted a grim picture of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33df4912-3926-4264-a706-aead38054335\">damage to Ukraine's economy</a> inflicted by more than seven weeks of war with its neighbour. Destruction to civilian and military infrastructure was estimated at $270bn, he said, with nearly 7,000 residential buildings damaged or destroyed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a former Russian finance minister said the country's economy would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8397113f-bc37-4376-9bde-339fded97569\">shrink by more than a tenth this year</a>, citing internal forecasts that have not been made public. Alexei Kudrin, who served as finance minister from 2000 to 2011 and now runs a budget watchdog, said the economy was struggling after sanctions were imposed on Russia, according to state news agency Interfax.</p> <h1>More from Ukraine: </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Diplomacy: </strong>Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer said he had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c17a97f-a867-42ed-9e74-bef305e0b884\">“no positive impression”</a> of his talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin, after a trip to Moscow yesterday to try to broker an end to the country's invasion of Ukraine.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Military update:</strong> Signs Russia was nearing a significant new offensive in eastern Ukraine mounted yesterday as US defence officials reported that troops withdrawn from Kyiv and the surrounding areas were being resupplied and reinforced by the Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/167c6cfb-44c3-41d4-b071-ea28ae520901\">for redeployment in the Donbas region</a> in the east of Ukraine.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>War crimes investigation: </strong>The Netherlands has called on governments to increase their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5dab1dcf-2add-4a65-a156-7511e8ff5854\">financial and political support</a> for the International Criminal Court as it investigates alleged war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Russian default:</strong> Moscow has vowed to sue if sanctions force it to default on its bonds but academics and lawyers have dismissed the threat as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e248abf-aa48-4b32-9f0f-c13289ba44a7\">“payment theatre”</a> designed to project the state's financial strength.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Track Russia's invasion of Ukraine </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4351d5b0-0888-4b47-9368-6bc4dfbccbf5\"><em>in maps</em></a><em> and for the latest news go to </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8397113f-bc37-4376-9bde-339fded97569#o-topper\"><em>our live blog</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Here's the rest of the day's news — Gordon.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. US orders non-essential consulate staff to leave Shanghai</strong> The US state department has ordered non-essential workers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5fa8730-0e36-4a77-97cf-718b7f9d4266\">to leave its consulate in Shanghai</a>.

Grocery stores performed well during the pandemic and have managed to keep that upbeat performance going even as inflation raises food prices and threatens margins.</p> <h1>What else we're reading and listening to</h1> <p><strong>No dethroning the dollar</strong> Sanctions against Russia are built around denying Moscow access to foreign currencies, particularly the dollar. It should follow that countries wanting to avoid a similar fate would seek to diversify away from the US currency.
