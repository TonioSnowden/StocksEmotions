  "text": "<p>Tidy desk, tidy mind. Tidy statement, tidy company?</p> <p>Next invites the question at least once a quarter with market communications that are models of clarity. An unscheduled update from the retailer on Wednesday set out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04082cc7-7879-4ac7-a410-c63860a4c316\">unambiguous targets</a> and gave its supporting evidence in plain language.</p> <p>Straightforwardness is easier when delivering good news, of which there was plenty. Recent sales trounced expectations. International expansion and demand for third-party labels kept momentum behind the online business. Stores remained in gentle decline. A shrinking of finance income also shrunk historic worries about regulation and customer credit risk. </p> <p>Cash discipline also helps maintain the sense of order. This year's surplus will find its way to shareholders via special dividends, and to the government via a refund of business rates relief. It's the kind of delivery that has earned Simon Wolfson, chief executive since 2001, an irreproachable reputation for competence.</p> <p>But surface calm risks underplaying Next's dramatic and potentially messy process of reinvention. Stable trading through a pandemic is a remarkable achievement. The bigger challenge is to emerge on the other side as an international multi-line retailer that's no longer beholden to lossmaking UK stores. </p> <p>There is a lot still to do. Online accounts for more than half of Next's group sales yet its estate has hardly changed in a decade. Closures whittled the store count to below 500 last year but total floor space crept higher to 8m square feet. That is in spite of revenue per square foot falling by about 60 per cent since the mid 2000s. </p> <p>Recent lease renewals have been an opportunity to push for turnover-linked rent but, when competitors are forcing rent cuts on landlords through insolvency proceedings, management's approach to real estate still feels conservative. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the hunt for online growth draws Next into unfamiliar territory. The habit of discipline competes with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ba6b7c2-649c-49a2-9797-d88cf0991db6\">acquisitions</a> and cash-hungry ventures such as an experiment in software licensing. Understanding their potential probably has to wait for the levelling out of a late-pandemic consumer spending wave that Wolfson states clearly will not last. </p> <p>Add in a UK incursion by Germany's Zalando and the threat to Next's credit business from buy-now-pay-later services <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aac740a4-106f-4bbf-b9ce-19af2a74055a\">such as Klarna</a>. Though management quality alone can justify Next's valuation premium to UK peers, at about 14 times upgraded earnings expectations, the process of navigating between its possible futures will be unavoidably messy. </p> <h2>Bridgepoint: public toll</h2> <p>Congratulations to JPMorgan Cazenove for getting its sums wrong in the right direction.</p> <p>Caz was sole sponsor and joint global co-ordinator with Morgan Stanley on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/181f6b11-9dad-4e92-b2e8-52cc9a43090b\">float of Bridgepoint</a>, so was central to setting a valuation just shy of £2.9bn. Less than half an hour after trading began, the private equity group was worth £3.6bn. </p> <p>It is a well understood quirk of IPOs that a debut day pop is cast as a victory while a drop causes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdf6ac6b-46b5-4f7a-90db-291d7fd2898d\">shame and agonising</a>. Intuitively, it should be the opposite. Companies pay syndicate banks to find the best price to sell. The secondary market is a test of whether they succeeded, or whether a desire to keep important trading customers sweet has resulted in leaving too much on the table. These and similar conflicts of interest are behind a recent enthusiasm for direct listings, led in the UK by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/811dacb5-a2ed-4208-9b93-41522f3b032b\">currency dealer Wise</a>.</p> <p>Bridgepoint wanted to raise cash so chose the traditional route to market, though it had alternatives. A stock market introduction after a private placement, for example, would surely have been within the scope of an organisation whose bread and butter is fundraising and transaction structuring. </p> <p>But Bridgepoint needed more than just new money, it wanted an exit for existing investors too. Pre-float shareholders accounted for more than 60 per cent of its primary offer. By far the easiest way to convince new investors to buy their second-hand stock is with the expectation of a debut pop.</p> <p>Bridgepoint and its advisers will be celebrating a job well done. But its first-day success only draws attention to the interlinked compromises at the heart of the conventional IPO process, which by over-prioritising those who want an exit ends up short changing nearly everyone.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Straight-talking Next offers few certainties but wins on clarity' FT.com 21 July.
