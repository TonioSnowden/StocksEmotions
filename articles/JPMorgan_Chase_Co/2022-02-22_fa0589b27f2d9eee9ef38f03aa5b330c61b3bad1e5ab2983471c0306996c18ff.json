  "text": "<p>Look at the share-price charts for Europe's banks and one fact is unmissable. Investors are finally feeling confident about these companies' prospects.</p> <p>After a decade during which the continent's banks have struggled with ever lower interest rates squeezing margins on the lending that is the dominant business line for most, the growing hawkishness of central banks is proving a cause for optimism. </p> <p>In the year to date, European bank stocks have clearly outperformed their US rivals — a rare event over any period since Wall Street's finest began pulling away from the European competition in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. </p> <p>That growing gap in profitability, and thus in relative market valuation, had many underpinnings — more decisive intervention from the US authorities in 2008 and 2009; a consistently better performing economy; but also a bias towards investment banking, which prospered thanks to booming securities trading and dealmaking that was eased by “free money”.</p> <p>But with higher interest rates favouring banks that depend instead on lending margins, European names are finally coming back in fashion. In the year to date, the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index is up more than 8 per cent, while the Dow Jones US banks index is up 3 per cent.</p> <p>The banks themselves have been busy stoking shareholders' nascent enthusiasm. </p> <p>Last week, the perennially unloved <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/04a061e0-0b47-4dee-81ff-456c105cc534\">Commerzbank</a> enjoyed an 8 per cent boost to its stock price, leaving the shares up by nearly a third since the start of the year. Lacklustre annual results were offset <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80fb7fef-ac62-495d-b44d-cbd1be782b6f\">by a prediction</a> that rising interest rates would yield a €1bn windfall.</p> <p>Earlier in the month, Spain's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d47803e0-9965-4d9a-af69-c346aa27ade8\">Santander</a> gave a similar impetus to a recent stock market rebound. After underperforming for several years, it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e13af549-5780-4352-b998-7fc04e25bddc\">struck a bullish tone</a> in its full-year results, predicting a boost to revenue from higher interest rates and promising higher shareholder payouts. The bank's share price is up 13 per cent year to date.</p> <p>Even NatWest, still majority owned by the UK government, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24c5d36d-265c-4a2a-b07e-6a2057a3d043\">sought last week</a> to shake off concerns about a lossmaking investment-banking arm and low-quality profits bolstered by the write-back of earlier loan loss provisions. It highlighted a booming mortgage business and insisted it was witnessing “really good customer resilience” despite growing concerns about a cost-of-living crisis for many Britons. The shares are flat thus far this year.</p> <p>The blindness to the downside risks — by investors and management teams alike — seems almost wilful.</p> <p>Just consider the looming danger of all-out war in eastern Europe, with all the global ramifications. Even European banks with substantial operations in Russia and/or Ukraine have largely shrugged off the risk. Only Raiffeisen has seen its shares decline (marginally) this year. Société Générale and UniCredit, the other two big participants in the region, are both up 6 per cent year to date.</p> <p>Geopolitics aside, the bull case for Europe's banks assumes that the upside of fatter interest-rate margins outweighs the related challenges of higher inflation and potential asset-price deflation. The fact that central bank stimulus has been so extreme and so long-lived over the past decade makes this a dangerous assumption.</p> <p>Higher mortgage costs at a time of increasing consumer inflation — particularly if energy bills rise further if there is war or protracted tensions over Ukraine — could well puncture housing bubbles across many markets. In Europe, where much of the mortgage risk sits on lenders' balance sheets, banks would bear the brunt.</p> <p>European banks with geographic diversification are not insulated as they might have been in previous cycles. The likes of HSBC and Standard Chartered, for example, clearly face heightened political risk doing business in China and Hong Kong. At the same time, their emerging markets focus exposes them to default risk from clients which have borrowed in dollars, as interest rates rise and the US currency strengthens.</p> <p>There are countless other idiosyncratic risks. What about the ongoing political and fiscal tensions from Italy to Latin America, where Spanish banks have large operations? And don't forget the growing competitive threat to incumbent banks in Europe — whether from US giants such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs or from tech challengers, big and small.</p> <p>It all adds up to a cocktail of issues that upbeat investors seem intent on ignoring. They will do so at their peril.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:patrick.jenkins@ft.com\"><em>patrick.jenkins@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Patrick Jenkins 2022 'Why European bank shares are experiencing a false dawn' FT.com 22 February.
