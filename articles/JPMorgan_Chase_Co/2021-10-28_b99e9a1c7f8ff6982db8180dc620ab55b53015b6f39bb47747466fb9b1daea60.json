  "title": "Oil's Topsy-Turvy Moment; The depletion of oil storage at Cushing is just one of the many market indicators that have flipped since April 2020",
  "text": "<p>Today, the opposite dynamic is playing out: The main worry is that the oil inventory level at Cushing, Okla., the pricing hub for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude, is getting too low. Any lower and it could drive WTI prices up dramatically. Last year's glut that caused oil prices to do the unthinkable seems like a distant memory.</p><p>Inventory at Cushing topped out at 65.4 million barrels last year in early May. As of last week, inventories have dropped to 27.3 million barrels, inching closer to the 20 million barrels that Cushing tanks require to maintain normal operations. The landlocked oil-tank capital of the world could be weeks away from being \"effectively out of crude,\" according to a report last week from JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>The widening price gap between front-month futures contracts, which are currently more expensive than those for deliveries further in the future, suggests that the market thinks the oil inventory level at Cushing might actually hit the bottom, notes Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. The price of WTI oil for December delivery today is $82.11 a barrel, $1.15 more expensive than the oil for January delivery, widening from $1.04 a week earlier.</p><p>The difference is even more stark when comparing the price of oil for delivery in December 2021 and 2022; that spread touched $12.50 a barrel Monday and is now about $10.48. Put another way, the market is so desperate for oil today that it is willing to pay a roughly 87 cent premium per barrel for every month of earlier delivery. Mr. Bouchouev dubs this \"super-backwardation,\" noting that the spread seen Monday was the third widest in WTI's history. That is the inverse of last year's situation, when the oil markets saw a super-contango, as prices for future delivery of oil were much costlier than oil delivery in the near term.</p><p>Both JPMorgan and Mr. Bouchouev note that it is unlikely for Cushing storage to actually hit bottom, just as the oil glut last year didn't actually lead to Cushing's storage reaching tank tops. JPMorgan, for example, said in its report that there is an increasing flow of crude oil from Canada and signs that U.S. oil production will increase in the fourth quarter. In previous bouts of low storage at Cushing, physical traders were nimble enough to react and redirect oil to the depleted hub. Moreover, WTI is now priced at only a small discount to Brent crude, the international benchmark, which should curb further flows of oil abroad. Additional draws at Cushing still could send prices higher, though.</p><p>Will there be any pain when that happens? Last year, super-contango and the plunge below zero meant several funds that tracked front-month oil futures—including the popular United States Oil Fund—suffered huge losses, hurting many individual investors. Today, that same strategy would make the same investors a lot of money. Ironically, changes those funds made to mitigate risk have limited their gains. Still, USO has gained 72% year-to-date and has outperformed its benchmark front-month WTI futures by 3.1 percentage points.</p><p>While the ride might be smoother for financial investors, motorists won't be so fortunate.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Oil's Topsy-Turvy Moment</p>",
