  "title": "Elon Musk's Tesla-Share Selling Spree Continues Into Second Week; Separately, JP Morgan sues car maker over alleged breach of contract involving stock warrants",
  "text": "<p>JP Morgan says that Tesla was required to deliver the bank shares or cash if the price of the car maker's stock was above the warrants strike price at the time the contract between the companies expired, which was the case. \"Tesla has flagrantly ignored its clear contractual obligation to pay JPMorgan in full,\" the lawsuit alleges.</p><p>The dispute between America's biggest bank and the world's most valuable auto maker over the warrants is complicated by Mr. Musk's assertion in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, only for him to reverse the statement soon after. The original assertion led the Securities and Exchange Commission to sue Mr. Musk for fraud, leading to several actions against the Tesla boss, including his relinquishing the role of Tesla chairman.</p><p>JP Morgan twice repriced the options over the episode, a move Tesla challenged as \"unreasonable\" at the time, according to the lawsuit. The bank rejected Tesla's complaint, the legal filing states, and argued its moves to adjust warrant prices were contractually required. Tesla's stock price at the time the warrant expired this year was above both the original and adjusted strike prices, the bank says in the filing.</p><p>Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the case.</p><p>Monday's sales mean Mr. Musk has sold around 7.3 million Tesla shares valued at about $7.8 billion since he signaled little more than a week ago that he would offload as much as 10% of his stock holdings in the company.</p><p>The latest sales came after Mr. Musk, therichest person in the world, mocked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) over the past weekend after the former presidential candidate tweeted that the ultra rich should pay their fair share of taxes.</p><p>\"We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,\" Mr. Sanders's account tweeted early Sunday afternoon.</p><p>\"I keep forgetting that you're still alive,\" Mr. Musk replied. \"Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word…\" he said in a follow-up reply.</p><p>A representative for Mr. Sanders didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Musk, at that point, had sold roughly $6.9 billion worth of Tesla stock the past week, one of the largest-ever stock disposals by a chief executive officer over a several-day period. The sale came after Mr. Musk earlier this month asked his followers through a Twitter poll if he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares. People voted in favor of the sale. Mr. Musk, ahead of the poll, had already scheduled the first share sales.</p><p>Mr. Musk has a net worth of around $279 billion, the richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and ahead of the second wealthiest, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated wealth of $203 billion.</p><p>The Twitter exchange between Mr. Musk and Mr. Sanders also comes as Democrats and the White House have been tryingto push the Build Back Better plan into law, which—among other things—would raise taxes on very high-income Americans and large companies. Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who ran against President Biden for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been in favor of raising tax rates on companies that have large gaps between what their workers and CEOs make.</p><p>Mr. Musk's social-media pronouncements have previously prompted scrutiny. He tweeted in 2018 about a potential buyout of Tesla that led to the Securities and Exchange Commission settling an enforcement action with the company alleging the CEO had committed fraud through his tweet. Mr. Musk and Tesla each had to pay $20 million to settle the case.</p><p>He also agreed to have lawyers for Tesla preapprove public statements from him disseminated on social media. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the SEC informed Tesla in 2020 that Mr. Musk's Twitter use had violated that policy twice.</p><p>MUSK'S STOCK SALES</p><p>* Elon Musk Sells Additional Tesla Stock Worth More Than $1.2 Billion (Nov. 12)</p><p>* Elon Musk Needs to Sell Millions of More Tesla Shares to Meet 10% Pledge (Nov. 11)</p><p>* Elon Musk's Possible Tesla Share Sale Comes as Tax Bill Looms (Nov. 9)</p><p>* Elon Musk's Twitter Poll Results Favor Tesla Stock Sale (Nov. 7)</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Elon Musk's Tesla-Share Selling Spree Continues Into Second Week</p>",
