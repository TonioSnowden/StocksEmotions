  "text": "<p>BlackRock, the world's largest money manager with $9 trillion in assets under management as of end March, has made expansion in China a priority. It got a nod from the China Securities Regulatory Commission in August 2020 to establish the mutual-fund business, which is now permitted to begin selling funds. \"We look forward to sharing our global investment expertise and offering more differentiated investment solutions to Chinese investors,\" Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink said.</p><p>Other global investment houses setting up wholly owned mutual-fund units in China include Fidelity International and the asset-management arm of JPMorgan.</p><p>BlackRock's Shanghai-based unit, BlackRock Fund Management Co., has six months to launch its maiden fund for individual investors, a spokeswoman said. This and future funds are likely to be sold through traditional mutual-fund distribution channels in China, she added.</p><p>Last month, BlackRock was permitted by China's banking regulator to pursue an onshore joint venture in wealth management with a unit of state-owned China Construction Bank and Singapore state investment company Temasek.</p>",
