  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Big Banks  Embrace  Diversity  Hiring  ----  By Ben Eisen",
  "text": "<p>   Five of the largest U.S. banks publicly committed to mandating a diverse slate of applicants when hiring employees, part of a push to diversify an industry whose top ranks remain largely white and male. </p><p>   JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and U.S. Bancorp all said they would either adjust policies for considering job candidates or disclose the ones they already have in place. </p><p>   Their policies mirror the so-called Rooney Rule, which started in the National Football League as a way of making sure people of color are considered for coaching jobs. In recent years, the rule has gained traction in corporate America, particularly for boards. </p><p>   The commitments came about after the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a union group, sent proposals to the banks in its capacity as a shareholder. The group owns shares through its reserve fund. That led to discussions and a series of agreements, according to Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets at AFL-CIO. </p><p>   Banks say they already had interview policies to diversify their ranks, but the public agreements are meant to add an element of accountability for their progress. </p><p></p>",
