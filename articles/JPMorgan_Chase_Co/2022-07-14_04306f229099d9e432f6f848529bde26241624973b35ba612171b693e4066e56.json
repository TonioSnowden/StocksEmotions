  "title": "Recession Noise May Drown Out Banks' Loan Boom",
  "text": "<p>Both businesses and consumers have dramatically picked up the pace of borrowing in the second quarter. Outside of a stimulus-aided surge early in the pandemic, U.S. bank loans' seasonally adjusted, annualized 15% quarter-over-quarter growth rate in the second quarter through June 29 would be the fastest in a quarter since 1984, according to Autonomous Research analyst Brian Foran's tracking of Federal Reserve data. The fastest growth was in commercial-and-industrial lending, at a roughly 24% annualized pace.</p><p>In theory, this can compound the positive earnings impact of higher interest rates: More loans, yielding more, equals a sharp increase in revenue. The leap in institutional-client borrowing should even help offset some of the fee business investment banks missed out on during Wall Street's capital-markets and deal-making slowdown. However, big lenders face a long list of things that may also blunt the upside in investors' minds of this long hoped-for arrival of loan growth in the earnings season that starts this week.</p><p>For one, there is the macro environment. Though JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon warned of an economic \"hurricane\" coming, he left open the possibility it would be a minor one.</p><p>Bankers also widely said that consumers are in good shape, with strong balance sheets, and with little expectation there will be lots of job losses -- usually a key trigger for credit problems. Still, even if it isn't their baseline expectation, banks might have to add to their reserves for potential credit losses if their models indicate a higher chance of a bad economic storm. That translates to lower net income via credit provisions.</p><p>This could be accompanied by another accounting hit, to capital levels. Rising Treasury and agency mortgage-bond yields mean lower market values of securities in banks' own portfolios. For the largest banks, that mark-to-market adjustment can flow through into a reduction in key capital levels. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that the very largest banks they cover could see an average 3% reduction to their tangible common equity-capital levels from this effect.</p><p>That doesn't show up in net income. But it puts yet more squeeze on banks' capital ratios. Already, banks including Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan are facing rising minimum capital requirements due to stress tests and other rules. Investors' hope is that this doesn't curtail banks' ability to use their balance sheets to tap into volatile markets via their trading desks, which has been lucrative for them so far.</p><p>It also leaves less room for capital return. Banks have laid out their dividends, but further details on how much of their share-buyback capacity they plan to use will be closely watched.</p><p>It will also be important to hear banks' commentary about deposits. Banks in the U.S. were on pace in the second quarter for a seasonally adjusted, annualized deposit decline of roughly 0.4%, which would be only the eighth such quarterly decline in the past 50 years, according to Autonomous.</p><p>Some of the biggest banks shouldn't yet feel too much pressure on funding costs, as many had an excess of fast-moving institutional cash that was always likely to shift into money markets. And big U.S. banks still had loan-to-deposit ratios of about 55% as of late June, according to Fed figures -- well shy of the 70% level at the start of 2020.</p><p>But all of these further-out worries may still cast a shadow over what might in many ways be a good quarter, marked by loan growth and solid trading revenues. S&amp;P 500 banks are now trading at a discount to book value and hovering around their lowest multiple ofnext-calendar-year earnings in about a decade, aside from March and April 2020, according to FactSet data. This highlights just how concerned investors are about the future. That is a tall wall of worry for banks to climb, and it will likely require more than just one good quarter.</p>",
