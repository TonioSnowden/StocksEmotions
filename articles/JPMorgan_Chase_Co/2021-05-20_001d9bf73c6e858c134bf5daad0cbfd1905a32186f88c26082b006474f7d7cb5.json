  "title": "Business News:  Oat-Milk Maker Oatly  Prices IPO at High End  ----  By Corrie Driebusch",
  "text": "<p>   Celebrity-backed Swedish oat-milk maker Oatly Group AB priced its initial public offering at $17 a share, at the high end of expectations, a positive sign for the company amid volatile stock-market trading. </p><p>   Oatly's IPO raised $1.43 billion, and the $17 price tag-gave the celebrity-backed company a valuation of roughly $10 billion. Oatly had set its sights on raising between $1.27 billion and $1.43 billion by selling roughly 84.4 million American depositary shares at $15 to $17 apiece, according to a regulatory filing. The proceeds will go to the company and selling shareholders. </p><p>   Oatly's stock will begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Thursday under the symbol OTLY. Proceeds from the IPO will go to both the company and selling shareholders. </p><p>   Pricing at the high end of the range is an encouraging   sign for Oatly, especially because going public has proved tough for several companies recently. The stock market has taken a turn lower on fears of inflation and investors have increasingly shied away from the types of growth companies that typically go public. The Nasdaq Composite Index, chock full of growth companies, has fallen 4.8% in May. </p><p>   Last week, at least three companies postponed their IPOs because of volatility in the stock market. On Wednesday, website-development company Squarespace Inc.'s shares made their debut on the New York Stock Exchange at a level far below their last financing round, then proceeded to fall further through the afternoon. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 ended Wednesday down 0.3%, recovering some of its losses from earlier in the trading session. </p><p>   Oatly and its lead underwriters, which include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse, hoped because the company is a consumer name rather than a technology company, it could sidestep some of the weakness in the broader market, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Oatly boasts famous investors including Oprah Winfrey and Natalie Portman, as well as private-equity giant Blackstone Group Inc. and lead investor Verlinvest. In July, Oatly announced a deal to sell a 10% stake to the group of celebrities and Blackstone for $200 million, valuing the company at $2 billion. </p><p>   Oat milk's popularity has soared recently. Its rise has been part of a shift among consumers toward more plant-based foods, similar to those produced by plant-based meat company Beyond Meat Inc. </p><p></p>",
