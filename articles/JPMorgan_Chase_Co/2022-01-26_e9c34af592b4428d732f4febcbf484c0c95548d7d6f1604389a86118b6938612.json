  "title": "24 software stocks, including Microsoft, expected to rise by double digits over the next year",
  "text": "<p>In a note to clients on Jan. 25, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote that forward price-to-earnings valuations for software companies had “contracted 23% [this year] after contracting 10% in '21 and expanding 80% in '20.”</p><p>He added that, following previous interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, “software valuations have contracted 24% on average.”</p><p>The stock market looks ahead — the declines from the highs of 2021 have anticipated increases in the federal funds rate, which is still in a target range of zero to 0.25%. But long-term interest rates have already begun to rise as the Fed tapers its bond purchases. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD10Y increased to 1.78% on Jan. 25 from 1.52% on Dec. 31.</p><p>The actual cycle of official rate increases may begin Wednesday afternoon when the Federal Open Market Committee releases its policy statement.</p><p>Read:Stock-market selloff is so overdone, the bar is low for a positive Fed surprise, say JPMorgan analysts</p><p>Thill wrote “there is still room for multiples to contract,” which means he doesn't think software stocks have bottomed yet. But for investors who wish to begin considering software stocks for the eventual rebound, a screen showing expected price increases and sales-growth rates is below.</p><p>Software P/E declines</p><p>In the midst of an earnings season during which stock prices have been falling, price-to-earnings ratios may decline more quickly than the stocks themselves, because forward earnings estimates have been increasing.</p><p>For example, shares of Microsoft Corp. MSFT closed at $288.49 on Jan. 25, down 14% from their Dec. 31 close at $336.32. But Microsoft's forward price-to-earnings ratio declined 16% to 28.6 as of the close on Jan. 25 from 34.1 at the end of 2021. Those forward P/E ratios are based on rolling 12-month earnings estimates among analysts polled by FactSet. The rolling EPS estimate for 12 months has increased as Microsoft's share price has fallen.</p><p>Microsoft's current forward P/E of 28.6 compares to forward P/E ratios of 24.9 for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector and 19.7 for the full S&amp;P 500 Index SPX. Then again, Microsoft's higher P/E valuation may seem justified if you look at the following comparison:</p><p>Forward P/E  Avg. forward P/E – 5 years  Sales CAGR – 5 years  EPS CAGR – 5 years  Microsoft Corp.                        28.6         26.8                        16.8%                 34.7%  S&amp;P 500 information technology sector  24.9         21.1                        10.2%                 19.4%  S&amp;P 500 Index                          19.7         18.9                        6.6%                  13.9%  Source: FactSet</p><p>The compound annual growth rates (CAGR) are based on calendar years through 2021 as calculated by FactSet for Microsoft (because the company's fiscal year ends June 30) and as estimated by FactSet for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector and the full index.</p><p>Now check out a comparison of five-year total returns:</p><p>FactSetSo a high P/E itself doesn't mean you shouldn't consider a stock, especially one of a company that has been increasing its sales and earnings so rapidly.</p><p>Software ETF and a stock screen</p><p>Thill pointed to the $5 billion iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV when discussing valuations. The ETF's share price is down 16% so far this year.</p><p>IGV holds 129 stocks and, through a modified market-cap-weighted strategy, “redistributes its portfolio away from tech giants into smaller, more growth-oriented software companies.” Among the 129, 90 are covered by at least 10 analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The following stock screen starts with that group of 90 companies, but doesn't consider earnings, because some rapidly growing — and highly regarded — software companies haven't yet turned profits.</p><p>To err on the side of caution, the following screen from the IGV list includes 24 companies covered by at least 10 analysts, with at least 85% “buy” or equivalent ratings. The list is sorted by implied 12-month upside, based on consensus price targets and includes expected sales CAGR through calendar 2023:</p><p> Company                               Ticker   Share “buy” ratings  Closing price – Jan. 25  Cons. price target  Implied 12-month upside potential  Estimated sales CAGR from 2021 through 2023  Market cap.
