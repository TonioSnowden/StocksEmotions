  "text": "<p>Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan signalled that he plans to continue leading the lender until the end of the decade, as he became the latest Wall Street boss to seek an extended tenure.&#xa0;</p> <p>In a memo to employees, Moynihan, 61, announced a shake-up of the bank's top ranks and said he had told the board of directors it would be his “privilege to serve with [the new team] as chief executive as we drive responsible growth through its second decade”. </p> <p>Moynihan is the latest banking executive to indicate that he intends to a keep a tight grip over his institution rather than hand the reins to a younger successor.&#xa0;Elevated to the top job in 2010, he “is planning to stay as chairman and CEO through this decade”, the bank confirmed. </p> <p>JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, 65, recently confirmed his desire to extend his tenure as chief executive into a third decade. The bank's board in July granted Dimon, who has been JPMorgan's chief since 2005, a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/177cd5e4-d17a-4516-974a-084a7a1eab26\">special award</a>” of share options, which directors said reflected their desire for him to continue leading the bank for a “significant number of years”.&#xa0;</p> <p>James Gorman, 62, has told Morgan Stanley's board that he is committed to staying on for at least three more years. However, he does not expect his tenure to extend beyond the next five, according to a person briefed on his plans, at which point he will have been in the role for about 16 years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Extended tenures of chief executives have attracted criticism from corporate governance experts who argue that leaders who have been in the job for a long period of time can struggle to prioritise new challenges. </p> <p>And potential successors can grow impatient and leave the bank, as has happened at JPMorgan, where a string of executives tipped for the top job have departed in recent years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bank of America also announced the departure of three senior executives and a broader restructuring of more than a dozen upper management positions on Friday.</p> <p>“This means we can apply a fresh perspective to reporting lines with an eye toward developing future leaders and giving them new roles and responsibilities to drive our responsible growth operating model into the next decade,” the bank said.</p> <p>Moynihan's overhaul will remove layers of management between himself and important business lines following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bf312c9-69d5-45ea-ad8f-d71b15da530f\">retirement announcements </a>last month of two senior leaders, chief operating officer Tom Montag and vice-chair Anne Finucane.&#xa0;</p> <p>Montag, who for years was paid more than Moynihan, had amassed a broad range of responsibilities and power not typically associated with the COO role. Having joined when BofA acquired his former employer Merrill Lynch, he oversaw all of the businesses that serve companies and institutional investors including trading and investment banking. </p> <p>The trading, investment banking and commercial banking business heads who previously reported to Montag will report directly to Moynihan. </p> <p>The bank also said Alastair Borthwick will take over from Paul Donofrio as chief financial officer. Borthwick's prior roles at BofA include president of global commercial banking and co-head of global capital markets</p> <p>Finucane's responsibilities will be divided among several executives elevated in the reshuffle. </p> <p>Thomas Scrivener, head of consumer and wealth operations, will manage the bank's firmwide processes as chief operations executive. </p> <p><em>This article has been amended to correct Thomas Scrivener's new title and role.</em></p><p>Source: Imani Moise and Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Moynihan signals desire to stay as BofA chief until end of decade' FT.com 10 September.
