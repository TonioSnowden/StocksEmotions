  "text": "<p>A group of liberal Democrats in the US Congress is pressing Joe Biden to pursue direct talks with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, opening a new front of pressure on the president's Ukraine strategy as his administration tries to maintain domestic support for Kyiv.</p> <p>“We urge you to pair the military and economic support the United States has provided to Ukraine with a proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a ceasefire,” the group wrote in a letter to the White House.</p> <p>It urged the US to “engage in direct talks with Russia” and “explore prospects for a new European security arrangement acceptable to all parties” before demanding the US “seek a rapid end to the conflict and reiterate this goal as America's chief priority”.</p> <p>The letter was signed by 30 lawmakers including Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43b56648-99f8-4aab-bcef-f80c6cb19afc\">a group of liberal congresswomen known as “the Squad”.</a></p> <p>The fresh division between the Democratic progressives and the White House comes just a week after Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/188401b5-229e-490a-9254-42167735d030\">warned that future assistance to Ukraine could be limited</a> if the party wins the House of Representatives in November's US midterm elections.</p> <p>Confirming the letter had been received, John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said the White House appreciates “their thoughtful concerns about what's going on in the war in Ukraine”, but added it was up to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to decide when to engage with Putin.</p> <p><em>Do you agree with the progressives?
