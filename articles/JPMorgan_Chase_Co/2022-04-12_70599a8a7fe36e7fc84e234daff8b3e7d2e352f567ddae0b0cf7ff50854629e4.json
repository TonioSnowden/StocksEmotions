  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 176 points, or 0.5%, to 34,484.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 28 points, or 0.6%, at 4,441.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 126 points, or 0.9%, to 13,538.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow fell 413 points, or 1.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2%. The S&amp;P 500 ended the session down 7% on the year.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. consumer prices rose 1.2% in March, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. Year over year, prices rose 8.5% — the fastest pace since January 1982.</p><p>But the news that cheered investors was that core price growth slowed to a 0.3% monthly rise versus expectations for a 0.5% increase. That still nudged the year-over-year rate to a 40-year high of 6.5%.</p><p>“The best you can say is that core CPI came in lower than expected at ‘only' 6.5%,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “That might give some relief to markets which were preparing for the worst.”</p><p>The key, he said, is whether inflation has peaked and, if so, how fast it will decline. “While this reading probably locks in a more aggressive Fed action near-term, there is some reason to believe that CPI will decline enough by year-end to avoid the most severe Fed action.”</p><p>Read: Inflation in March ran hotter than expected. Here's the good news.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which on Monday reached a three-year high, dropped nearly 7 basis points to around 2.70%. The surge in yields has been making stocks less attractive on a relative basis and has weighed in particular on technology and other so-called growth shares whose valuations are based on earnings and cash flow far into the future.</p><p>Investors were also awaiting the unofficial kickoff of earnings season on Wednesday, with results due from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, while other big Wall Street banks were due to report on Thursday.</p><p>Earnings Outlook:U.S. banks are facing body blows from Ukraine war and a slump in investment banking activity</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>Shares of CarMax Inc.KMX fell 5% after the used-car retailer missed fiscal fourth-quarter profit estimates, offsetting a revenue beat.</p><p>How other assets are trading</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.1%.</p><p>Oil futures bounced sharply higher, with the U.S. benchmark CL.1 up 6.7% at $100.61 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 rose 1.7% to trade above $1,981 an ounce.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP fell 0.5%, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX declined 0.6%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP rose 1.5%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 0.5% in Hong Kong and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK slumped 1.8%.</p>",
