  "text": "<h2>JPMorgan Russia: bear necessities</h2> <p>“Bears are faster than most think, do not try to outrun them.” So says the email signature of Oleg Biryulyov, lead manager of <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=JRS:LSE\">JPMorgan Russian Securities</a> investment trust. The closed-end single-country fund has been the London market's worst performer this year, losing as much as 90 per cent of its value for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">obvious reasons</a>.</p> <p>The Moscow stock exchange's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad1b2b36-5f86-4854-b904-3a92a87bc8b0\">partial reopening</a> on Thursday has given JPMorgan Russian Securities some respite as key holdings, including Gazprom, Sberbank and Lukoil, could once again be benchmarked. But JPMorgan did not adjust its net asset value for the fund of 40.3p per share, which is based largely on a few Kazakh-listed holdings and was less than half of its closing price on Thursday. The board, having recommended in early March that investors vote for the fund to continue for another five years, now has to balance reputational damage to its parent against the impossibility of winding up tidily while Russian markets remain off-limits. Calls to Biryulyov were directed to the JPMorgan Asset Management press office, which declined to comment.</p> <p>But who are the investors now on the hook? <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=CLIG:LSE\">City of London Investment Group</a> remains the JPMorgan fund's biggest shareholder, having cut its stake from nearly 30 per cent a year ago to 17.6 per cent as of this week. The specialist fund manager, commonly known as CLIG, is an oddity: it buys closed-end funds for emerging and frontier markets and puts them into low-tax, high-yield wrappers that are sold almost exclusively to US institutions. JPMorgan Russian Securities has been among its core holdings for at least two decades. And while CLIG's name and a headquarters next to Leadenhall Market speak of Englishness, its chief executive Tom Griffith works from an office known as <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/v76CXb5hsoZkNhZU9\">The Barn</a> on the outskirts of Coatesville, Pennsylvania — a small town about an hour west of Philadelphia.</p> <p>CLIG's London-listed shares slid lower by as much as 25 per cent on the outbreak of war in Ukraine, in spite of assurances on the company's website that its exposure to Russian securities on a see-through basis was only approximately 0.25 per cent of assets. The slump drew out one knowledgeable buyer: Barry Olliff, who founded the stockbroker that became CLIG in the 1980s and <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/aikenstandard/sundays_best/barry-olliff-a-life-of-investments-and-horses/article_49db77de-786a-11eb-8072-b7e3d4f747ce.html\">emigrated to Coatesville</a> in the 1990s. Having stepped down from an executive role at the end of 2019 and sold down most of his stake, Olliff flipped strategies to catch the stock's one-year low in early March and netted an almost instant 16 per cent return. He is spending his retirement at a stables in South Carolina, where advice about outrunning bears is not always a metaphor.</p> <h2>Man Group: marked man</h2> <p><a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=EMG:LSE\">Man Group</a> takeover speculation comes around about as often as an Olympic Games. The £3bn-valued investment manager was back in focus this week thanks to Shore Capital, whose analyst Ben Williams advised clients to “buy it before someone else does”.</p> <p>For a fast-growing business that delivers high returns from hard-to-replicate products, Man's valuation of just over 9 times forward earnings looked wrong, Williams said in a research note. And though 2021 was an exceptional year for the company — with net inflows of $14.7bn and assets under management up 20 per cent to $149bn — its after-tax profit margins have been reliably high since 2019. A share price of 320p, a 44 per cent premium to Thursday's close, would be more appropriate for what in recent years has become a better quality business, Williams wrote. </p> <p>Might the fantasy M&amp;A have some foundation this time around? Man chief executive Luke Ellis was a panellist at Morgan Stanley's European Financials Conference last week. Themes included how a prolonged bear market would force asset managers with weak profitability into consolidation and how private market valuations had become inflated relative to public ones. Similar themes have been behind the recurring speculation over the years that Man itself would be a target for a US bank such as BNY Mellon, which in 2017 took over back-office administration of the company's flagship AHL quantitative fund set, or JPMorgan, where Ellis spent a decade in the 1990s building its global equity derivatives business.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2022 'JPMorgan's Russian connections prove tricky to untangle' FT.com 24 March.
