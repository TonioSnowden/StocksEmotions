  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For the past year, investors have been worried that rising costs might start putting a big drag on companies' earnings. It looks as if that happened in the first quarter. </p><p>\n  Analyst estimates now put first-quarter earnings per share at companies in the S&amp;P 500 at 6.4% ahead of their year-earlier level, according to Refinitiv. Net income, which doesn't include the flattering effects of companies' share count reductions, is estimated to be up a more modest 4.3%. </p><p>\n  Given that reported results tend to come in better than estimates, the actual growth figures should be a bit higher, but they still won't be close to the fourth-quarter's earnings-per-share gain of 32% and net-income gain 30%. </p><p>\n  What is more, they are likely to grow more slowly than S&amp;P 500 revenue, which analysts now put at 10.9%, or U.S. gross domestic product, which JPMorgan Chase economists estimate expanded by 10.4% from a year earlier, unadjusted for inflation, in the first quarter. </p><p>\n  One challenge companies faced in the first quarter was rising commodity costs, particularly the jump in fuel costs that came after Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February. Over time, companies can pass these costs on to consumers, but the suddenness of some of the increases -- diesel went from an average of $4.03 a gallon in February to $5.11 in March -- might have meant that companies couldn't act fast enough to prevent inflation from taking a bite out their first-quarter earnings. </p><p>\n  The bigger and more consequential issue for public companies might be the combination of rising labor costs and shifting spending patterns. </p><p>\n  Labor costs rose last year, but even so, companies' share of the U.S. economy rose. Commerce Department figures show that after-tax corporate profits (which includes both public and private companies) came to 10.5% of GDP last year, the highest level on record going back to 1929. But with the Labor Department's measure of aggregate weekly payrolls for private-sector employees 11.1% higher in the first quarter than a year earlier, that profit share might now be slipping. </p><p>\n  At the same time, U.S. consumers are shifting more of their spending back toward services and away from goods. That matters for S&amp;P 500 earnings, because the index includes a higher concentration of goods-selling companies than in the economy at large. So the dynamic might be one in which goods-selling companies face rising labor costs, because they compete to some extent for workers with companies that sell services, yet have a harder time passing those costs on as their sales growth slows. </p><p>\n  Moreover, the pressure on profit margins might not go away soon, as a tight labor market provides more workers with the bargaining power they need for their paychecks to keep up with, or exceed, inflation. Analysts expect S&amp;P 500 earnings growth to bounce back, and to begin exceeding revenue growth again by the third quarter, but that could be wishful thinking. </p><p></p>",
