  "title": "Perfect Storm Struck a Black Swan:  Pros Explain Your Falling 401(k)  ---  Financial experts roll out the buzzwords.  'Going back into the vault of cliches.'  ----  By Gregory Zuckerman",
  "text": "<p>   On Wall Street, there's still one bull market -- in metaphors to explain the fall. </p><p>   Tumbling prices for stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies have investment pros and executives scrambling to explain what happened, and why so many were caught flat-footed. Many have turned to the title of Sebastian Junger's 1997 book about a fishing boat lost at sea when three dangerous weather events converged. </p><p>   \"This is like the perfect storm,\" Mizuho Group analyst Dan Dolev recently said about the crypto collapse. </p><p>   We're in a \"perfect storm with energy prices,\" heating-oil executive Katie Childs added. </p><p>   Researcher Paul Rowaday used the same blustery image to explain the challenges facing Robinhood Markets, while analyst Dan Ives employed it for the tech-stock tumble. </p><p>   The perfect storm is not alone. Blockchain executive Ahmed Ismail, seizing on another contender for the year's most beloved bromide, labeled the recent collapse of stablecoin terraUSD \"a black swan event.\" </p><p>   Offering reassurance, Coinbase Global CEO Brian Armstrong said his firm wasn't at risk of bankruptcy even if in the event of \"a black swan.\" </p><p>   That image, of course, refers to the colorful term for an unpredictable event popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2001 book \"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets,\" and later bestseller \"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.\" </p><p>   Downturns have always sent analysts searching for easy and relatable explanations. Often they reach for the same cliches. In 2008, with the economy in recession, many pointed toanother nautical reference: \"headwinds.\" </p><p>    The phrases suggest trouble due to factors that, like natural disasters, even experts couldn't be expected to anticipate. In May, instant-delivery company Getir Perakende Lojistik said it was cutting staff to \"adjust to the new climate.\" JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon said an economic \"hurricane\" was brewing. </p><p>   \"People are going back into the vault of cliches,\" said Sydney Finkelstein, a corporate-leadership professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, referring to the recent, um, perfect storm of buzzwords. </p><p>   Some find comfort in metaphors, however mixed. In May, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski of Klarna Bank, in announcing layoffs, told staffers, \"Klarna does not exist in a bubble.\" </p><p>   Headded: \"While crucial to stay calm in stormy weather, it's also crucial not to turn a blind eye to reality.\" </p><p>   Descriptive imagery can be helpful, a way to visualize an event or challenge. Vicious periods for stock investors have long been described as bear markets (often with a dependable modifier, \"grinding\"). </p><p>   Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset wrote: \"The metaphor is perhaps the most fruitful power of man. Its efficacy verges on magic.\" </p><p>   But many see the reflexive resort to trite analogies as unhelpful. \"People feel a need to make sense of events and find explanations, and this gives a veneer of credibility, but in fact the executives have no clue and are flailing around like everyone else,\" Mr. Finkelstein said. \"It's the perfect excuse to shift blame.\" </p><p>   Mr. Taleb is critical of those who invoke the concept he wrote about.  In \"The Black Swan,\" he describes events that carry extreme impact and are outside the realm of regular expectations. \"Very few people understand what the term means. It's tremendously frustrating,\" said Mr. Taleb. </p><p>   It offends him to hear the term used for this year's market doldrums and crypto collapse, which many had anticipated and which aren't unusual by historic norms. </p><p>   \"You have to be a moron to think these are rare, unpredictable events,\" he said. </p><p>   It's not clear why lazy analogies seem more popular in the executive suite than in areas like politics. Academics have their theories. \"The perfect storm suggests a degree of impotence in the face of challenges, which is usually not the best look for politicians,\" said Mr. Finkelstein. </p><p>   Some executives are trying to ignore dark clouds or find rays of sunshine, so to speak. In May, after the S&amp;P 500 dropped 4% in a single day, Robinhood sent customers advice on dealing with the market's \"volatility,\" rather than use a more downbeat description of the plunge. Louis Schoeman, CEO of Forex Suggest, in June called the crypto selloff a \"cleansing process.\" </p><p>   That month, instant-delivery startup Jokr SARL said it was profitable -- based on \"fully gross profit positive on a group level for our local business across all of our countries after 12 months of operations,\" a metric that left tax expert Robert Willens scratching his head. \"It's an extreme example of a company devising its own eclectic metric to highlight its 'profitability,'\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Junger cautions about using his turbulent title to explain these times. The perfect storm he wrote about resulted from a rare convergence of three weather patterns yet wasn't shocking to meteorologists. Sailors were caught too far out to sea. </p><p>   Business leaders and financial pros may be more akin to meteorologists, who had reason to expect a storm, than the sailors. \"It seems like there are some cautionary actions that can be taken in finance that you can't a thousand miles out at sea when there are alarming things on the horizon,\" Mr. Junger said. </p><p>   The resort to the perfect-storm explanation is understandable, he said, even if it is rarely an exact analogy. At least Wall Street and corporate executives aren't using it for life's mundane setbacks. </p><p>   \"I've heard people say it's a perfect storm if they're late picking up their kids from school,\" Mr. Junger said. </p><p></p>",
