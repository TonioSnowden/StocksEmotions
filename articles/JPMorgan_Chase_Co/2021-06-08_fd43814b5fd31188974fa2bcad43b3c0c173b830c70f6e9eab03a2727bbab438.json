  "title": "Commodity Prices  Skyrocket, Adding  To Inflation Fears  ----  By Tom Fairless, Alistair MacDonald and Jesse Newman",
  "text": "<p>   The across-the-board rise in commodity prices at levels not seen since the start of the financial crisis is casting a cloud over the global economic recovery, slamming vulnerable businesses and households and adding to fears that inflation could become more persistent. </p><p>   Lumber, iron ore and copper have hit records. Corn, soybeans and wheat have jumped to their highest levels in eight years. Oil recently reached a two-year high. </p><p>   Economists are expecting consumer-price data due this week to underscore the trend. They said China's producer-price index, a gauge of factory-gate prices, could climb to its highest level since August 2008 on Wednesday amid rising commodity prices. The U.S. consumer-price index, released a day later, is expected to show a sharp rise in the 12 months through May, also driven by higher labor costs. </p><p>   Ordinarily, economists and central bankers try not to worry too much about commodity-price moves. Commodity prices can be volatile, and they make up a smaller part of consumer inflation than other costs, like housing. </p><p>   But manufacturers' profit margins are shrinking because of higher costs for raw materials. Households are paying more for gas, groceries and some restaurant bills, curbing their ability to spend elsewhere. In poorer countries, some are going without basic needs entirely. </p><p>   \"We are being hit from every possible angle,\" said Franz Hofmeister, chief executive of Quaker Bakery Brands Inc. in Appleton, Wis. He said his costs for items including wheat, energy and new aluminum equipment have shot up at least 25% to 35% this year. </p><p>   Many factors are driving the increases, including ultra-strong consumer demand and supply-chain bottlenecks. But behind many of them, many economists said, is a deliberate decision by policy makers in the U.S. and elsewhere to run their economies hot for now, with lots of stimulus, to ensure they recover fully from damage caused by Covid-19. </p><p>   Central bankers must decide whether they can keep looking past commodity-price increases, along with other signs of higher inflation, or must move faster to cool demand through rate rises or other moves. In the 1970s, the last time before the financial crisis that commodity prices jumped at these levels, many countries gave priority to jobs and growth over controlling consumer prices during a series of oil shocks, and experienced high inflation. </p><p>   Brazil, Russia and Turkey have tightened policy as commodity prices climb. </p><p>   Officials at other central banks, including the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, have remained sanguine. At an event in May, ECB chief economist Philip Lane argued high unemployment would help keep inflation under control. </p><p>   Commodities generally make up a relatively small part of consumer prices. They are mainly used for producing goods as opposed to services, which are a bigger part of developed-world economies. Goods make up about 20% of the weighting of the U.S. consumer-price index. </p><p>   Academic work also suggests that the impact of commodity-price shocks on inflation has fallen in recent decades, as elements such as branding have become important in final costs. </p><p>   Commodities also have come to play a smaller role in final production as businesses become more efficient, according to research by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The U.S. roughly tripled its economic output per kilogram of oil consumed between 1990 and 2015, according to the World Bank. </p><p>   \"Oil used to be important enough to swing inflation, but now no commodity is,\" said Dirk Schumacher, a former ECB economist now at Natixis. </p><p>   Still, commodity prices could be decisive at a time when other forces are pushing prices higher, he said. </p><p>   Surging commodity prices also can be an early warning of future inflation because commodity markets react more rapidly to changes in the economy than prices for final goods. </p><p>   The impact of oil's climb already is showing up in consumer-price data: Figures for the eurozone showed consumer prices were 2% higher in May than a year earlier, the fastest rise since late 2018, largely because of energy. </p><p>   In the U.S., it now costs an average of $1.02 a gallon more to fill up a gas tank than a year ago, according to GasBuddy, which analyzes fuel prices. </p><p>   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said global food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade, led by surges in products such as vegetable oils and cereals that are crucial to developing world diets. </p><p>   Companies including General Mills Inc. and Hormel Foods Corp. are raising prices. </p><p>   Economists note that some commodity prices, notably crude oil, are merely returning to pre-pandemic levels. Recent increases are built on comparisons with mid-2020, when consumption was depressed because of the pandemic. </p><p>   Many also believe commodity-price growth will subside this year as some U.S. consumer spending shifts to services, which are less commodity-intensive. Chinese consumption of industrial metals, which is about half of global demand, is expected to fall as Beijing reins in credit growth, according to Capital Economics. </p><p>   \"Oil has gone from $35 to $70 [a barrel]. It's not going to rise to $140,\" said Dan Smith, special adviser at Oxford Economics in London. \"A lot of commodity prices will go broadly sideways for the next three to six months.\" </p><p>    Michael Hanson, senior global economist at JPMorgan Chase Bank, said that while higher prices for raw materials will probably result in temporary inflation pressures, it won't make much of a dent in the U.S. economy. </p><p>   Much of the recent inflation uptick is because of the frenzied nature of the economy's reopening, he said, and the economy is strong enough to weather it. </p><p>   The commodity boom also has winners: It is creating a windfall for farmers and agribusinesses, lifting prices for U.S. farmland and benefiting commodity-exporting nations. </p><p></p>",
