  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Who Pays for Climate Change? --- An ex-central banker is leaning on big banks to commit to the U.N.'s green protocols. It can be a tough sell.",
  "text": "<p>\"The world is watching,\" he said in an interview. \"I am going to be judged. Everyone is going to be judged.\"</p><p>Can he pull it off? The answer will help determine one of the biggest open questions of the coming decades: Who pays for climate change? There is a general agreement among businesses, investors and the U.S. government that the country should become carbon neutral in the coming 30 years while limiting the climate costs already incurred. The challenge, however, is figuring out how to split the price of making that happen.</p><p>Mr. Carney's appeal to the global finance community is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Analysts say as much as $150 trillion is likely needed over the next three decades to fund renewable energy projects, upgrade electric grids, mothball fossil-fuel plants, seed new agricultural technologies, and pay for damages tied to climate change.</p><p>The Glasgow summit, the successor to the Paris conference that produced the 2015 climate accords, offers another forum to wrestle with these issues. This time, nations are under pressure to lay out clear plans to cut carbon emissions this decade and become carbon neutral by 2050. The aim is to limit global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels, and preferably 1.5 degrees, thresholds above which many climate scientists warn of catastrophic and irreversible harm.</p><p>As the U.N.'s point man on climate-change finance, Mr. Carney had some early successes. He got commitments last spring from Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. to shift their money to businesses that reduce global carbon emissions. Big insurers and asset managers, too, signed on in large numbers.</p><p>The rest of Wall Street was a tougher sell. He encountered resistance at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where Mr. Carney spent 13 years. The major Canadian banks dragged their feet, too, another awkward setback for Mr. Carney, a native son who harbors political ambitions in the country. Most big banks from China, India, Japan and Australia haven't joined.</p><p>What he wanted the banks to do specifically was agree to steps outlined in a 14-page protocol written by the environmental arm of the United Nations. That would mean setting targets for less lending and investment in enterprises that produce carbon emissions; devoting more support to new, environmentally sustainable technologies; and publishing their progress on these targets each year. Banks would be under pressure to either push clients away from carbon emissions or drop those that don't comply.</p><p>Some of the biggest concerns from the banks were potential legal risks, the feasibility of measuring their total exposure to carbon emissions and how annual progress reports could be received by shareholders. Banks were particularly worried about getting lending and investment portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier. If a bank failed to reach net zero, would shareholders sue? Bank chief executives also fretted that climate promises might harm their successors if targets weren't met.</p><p>Supporters of Mr. Carney, such as the White House and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, put the screws to fellow financiers in ways that some found irritating. Large shareholders that belonged to his alliance prodded holdout banks. During the U.N. General Assembly meeting in late September, Mr. Carney walked through gridlocked traffic to lobby Goldman's CEO, David Solomon -- a stark reversal of roles from the days when Mr. Carney, the central banker, set the rules and Wall Street obeyed.</p><p>He appealed to their vanity. Banks that didn't commit by Oct. 15 wouldn't have their logos on Glasgow press materials. Their executives would miss out on prime speaking slots at the conference, Mr. Carney's staff warned.</p><p>One of Mr. Carney's biggest challenges would be convincing JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, boss of the largest bank in the U.S. by assets. Mr. Dimon privately criticized Mr. Carney's effort as overly vague, people familiar with the matter said. He also worried that it would conflict with potential new regulations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, these people said.</p><p>Mr. Carney, 56, is the product of a remote town in Canada's Northwest Territories called Fort Smith, where the average January high is 0 degrees Fahrenheit and the motto inscribed on the town flag is \"perseverance.\" His parents -- who moved to Edmonton, Alberta, while he was still young -- were teachers and volunteers in local community, church and school programs. He said they encouraged him to \"give and serve.\"</p><p>Mr. Carney did well enough in school to attend Harvard University, where he studied economics and economic history and paid for schooling with a grant and student loans. He later got a master's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Oxford, in economics.</p><p>He joined Goldman because, he said, his brother had worked there and \"I had an enormous sum of money in student loans\" that needed to be paid off. It also allowed him to see the world; he helped countries such as South Africa, Japan and Russia dig their way out of economic crises in the 1990s. The work helped him understand, he said, the impact one could have in government and influenced his decision to leave so he could help set monetary policy and regulate banks. He was governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and then governor of the Bank of England for seven years.</p><p>During his stay at the Bank of England he usually ran twice a week to his office -- roughly 9 kilometers from his West Hampstead home -- and did so without any security or bodyguards. \"It was the best way to be on the streets and not get recognized,\" he said. \"Surprisingly therapeutic.\"</p><p>He said he still jogs twice a week along the Ottawa River with friends who have been running with him for about 20 years. Except for winter months, his run ends with a plunge in a pond near his home in Rockcliffe Park, an affluent Ottawa neighborhood with heritage homes, foreign embassies and private schools. He said he also goes to Catholic church at least once a week, meditates and is a fan of Benedictine monk Laurence Freeman, the director of the World Community of Christian Meditation. His taste in music ranges from Nick Cave to Taylor Swift, whom he saw in concert while in the U.K.</p><p>Mr. Carney became increasingly critical of the financial industry in recent years. This spring he published a book titled \"Value(s): Building a Better World for All\" that he wrote during the pandemic. In it Mr. Carney, who experienced the aftershocks of the 2008-09 financial crisis in Canada and England, said he \"worked to heal the malignant culture at the heart of financial capitalism.\"</p><p>His climate work began with what he assumed would be a short assignment. After leaving the Bank of England in 2020, he took on what he thought was a six-month job as U.N. special envoy on climate action and finance, a way to burnish his credentials with a private sector he hoped to re-enter. That six-month gig is now going on two years.</p><p>He launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero this spring. That set him off on a global recruiting effort to get financial companies to agree to set meaningful targets for reducing loans and investments to businesses that, directly or indirectly, are big emitters of greenhouse gases.</p><p>The campaign offered a new set of challenges for banks. Many had already backed away from the dirtiest investments, such as directly financing coal-fired power plants or new mines in ecologically sensitive spots. But the guidelines set by the U.N.'s environment arm would require that financial institutions first set public targets for shifting clients away from carbon emissions and then calculate the emissions produced by any investment long after the check was written -- a task made more complicated by the range of industries banks typically support.</p><p>A bond of bundled car loans, for example, would have to measure the gas burned by those vehicles. A letter of credit guaranteeing safe passage of an oil tanker would have to account for the carbon released when that crude is refined. It is not yet known how this tracking will work exactly and whether it might raise costs for banks or borrowers.</p><p>After an initial wave of bank sign-ups in the spring, Mr. Carney's recruiting campaign stalled. By early September, 28 of the world's largest 50 banks by assets had not joined, leaving just a month to deliver on his mandate before diplomats descended on Glasgow.</p><p>He tried to act like the regulator he once was, scolding banks in an August tweet: \"If you're not part of the solution, you are the problem.\" He appealed to their greed, calling the fight against climate change \"the biggest commercial opportunity in the world.\"</p><p>Neither strategy worked. His campaign struck many executives at holdout firms as both arrogant and toothless, likely to mire their firms in paperwork for decades and expose them to potential lawsuits from shareholders claiming they weren't doing enough. Similar blowback surfaced recently after banks signed a pledge not to fund oil drilling in the Arctic. Some investors and environmentalists say that pledge contains loopholes, and money has continued to flow from big banks to companies active in areas of Norway, Russia, Canada and Alaska rich in oil and gas.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
