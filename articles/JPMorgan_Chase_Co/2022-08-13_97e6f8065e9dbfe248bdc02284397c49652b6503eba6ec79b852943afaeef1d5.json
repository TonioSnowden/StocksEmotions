  "text": "<p>Good morning from sweltering Brooklyn, where the dog days of summer lead to my neighbours blasting off fireworks in the streets and local basketball titans shooting off fireworks in their tweets. (Sorry.) This week the <strong>National Basketball Association</strong> off season took a turn when <strong>Brooklyn Nets</strong> star <strong>Kevin Durant</strong> reportedly offered team owner <strong>Joe Tsai</strong> an ultimatum on his demand for a trade, leading the <strong>Alibaba </strong>vice-chair to blast off an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joetsai1999/status/1556791235427405824?s=20&amp;t=v-tflkA4zQMa0ishebBAIQ\">indirect dig</a> at KD. </p> <p>Across team sports, trade deadlines and front office machinations are the stuff of intense palace intrigue. What makes the Nets conundrum peculiar is its potent combination of a star player in Durant — caught in the embarrassing limbo of asking for a trade and still waiting for an answer — with the thus-far unprecedented public pushback by an owner. Whatever the outcome in Brooklyn, this situation will be a litmus test for the player-empowerment era.<br><br>Speaking of empowerment, we lead off this week with a look at the legacy of <strong>Serena Williams</strong>, and proceed with a report card on the conclusion of the <strong>Commonwealth Games</strong>. Do read on —<em> Sara Germano, US sports business correspondent</em></p> <h1>Serena Williams and the tennis she leaves behind</h1> <p>This month's <strong>US Open</strong> championships are to be the curtain call for Serena Williams, after a more than two-decade professional tennis career that has shattered barriers and broken records.</p> <p>In a first-person <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-retirement-in-her-own-words\">cover story</a> for Vogue published this week, Williams said her desire to expand her family with her husband, the <strong>Reddit</strong> co-founder <strong>Alexis Ohanian</strong>, coupled with her deepening work in venture capital and sports management, led to her decision to step off the court. </p> <p>With 23 Grand Slam titles to her name, Williams stands one shy of tying <strong>Margaret Court</strong>‘s all-time record, achieved mostly before the Open era. That's more major titles than any of the men's Big Three (<strong>Rafael Nadal</strong> at present leads with 22 titles), placing Williams in the stratosphere as the greatest tennis player of all time. </p> <p>Along the way, it's no exaggeration to say Williams and her elder sister <strong>Venus</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb4bdbcc-3eeb-4118-b1d2-584f10270936\">transformed the sport</a>. Their precocious success in winning <strong>Wimbledon</strong> and US Open titles in their teens introduced tennis to a new generation of fans, especially black women and girls. </p> <p>A pivotal moment came in 2001. Months before the US Open began, executives at <strong>Viacom's CBS</strong>, then the domestic tournament rights holder, made a historic decision to move the women's final to prime time, slotting it against guaranteed ratings draws of US college football. As luck would have it, the Williams sisters ended up meeting each other for the championship match — their first meeting in a Grand Slam final — making it the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/tennis/usopen01/s/2001/0909/1249852.html\">most-watched programme</a> on US television that night.</p> <p>“It really transcended sports and became a news item”, CBS Sports president <strong>Sean McManus</strong> said at the time. “People who wouldn't normally watch a women's tennis event tuned in to see what all the buzz was about.”</p> <p>Over time, Serena gained the competitive and marketing upper hand. Not one but two catsuits (the first by <strong>Puma</strong>, the other by her current outfitter <strong>Nike</strong>) sparked transformative conversations about fashion. Serena's ability to transcend tennis earned her a long list of corporate sponsors, from <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> to <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>Audemars Piguet</strong>. To date, she's amassed almost $95mn in career prize money with a net worth of more than $260mn, according to Forbes.</p> <p>In the two days since her retirement announcement, the average ticket price for the opening rounds of the US Open shot up 25 per cent to $188, according to ticketing firm <strong>Logitix.</strong></p> <p>If Flushing will indeed be Serena's swansong on the court, then those running global tennis are going to need fresh ideas to keep crowds and sponsors coming. As in other professional sports, there have been talks within tennis about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24166f9c-a6a7-43fb-b78b-f6b5f5377acd\">private capital investment</a> in tour operations. Younger stars such as <strong>Naomi Osaka</strong>, <strong>Iga Świątek</strong>, and <strong>Coco Gauff</strong> are dynamic players and sponsor favourites, though as tennis and the world may be about to discover, there is no comparison to Serena.</p> <h1>Can a smaller Commonwealth Games survive?</h1> <p>This week, the <strong>Commonwealth Games</strong> crossed the finishing line in Birmingham. It had already been billed as the last of its kind, amid concerns about rising costs and falling interest. The organisers are well aware of the competition's shortcomings and set about reforming it late last year. </p> <p>In future, the Games will be cheaper, smaller and more flexible. The goal is to attract a more diverse range of potential hosts, especially beyond the UK and Australia. Rather than host cities, the Games could be staged in host regions, nations or even continents. The 2026 event will be across the Australian state of Victoria, while the longer-term dream is a pan-Caribbean or pan-African Games. </p> <p>The plans were prompted in part by Durban's fluffed attempt to host the Games. The 2022 contest was moved to Birmingham after the South African government decided not to fund it. &#xa0;</p> <p>But the Commonwealth Games has more problems other than just the costs. It is not the apex of athletic achievement. Not only is it missing many key nations, but those that do participate don't always send their top athletes. This year's event came hot on the heels of the <strong>World Athletics Championships</strong> in Oregon, causing some would-be winners to skip it. </p> <p>Broadcasters and sponsors appear to be in short supply. The Games has just one long-term sponsor, watchmaker <strong>Longines</strong>. The other sponsors at Birmingham were all on one-time deals and included a local university and the local water company. Broadcasters were still being signed up with just days to go.</p> <p>There is a big risk with trying to slim down the event. With commercial opportunities in short supply, one of the main incentives to host the Games is the chance to boost local infrastructure, according to Simon Shibli, professor of sport management at <strong>Sheffield Hallam University</strong>. Birmingham was able to secure 80 per cent of the almost £800mn investment for the Games from a UK government keen to showcase post-Brexit Britain. So for some hosts, the high cost can actually be the main selling point. </p> <p>“Unless you're using it as a Trojan horse for significant infrastructure investment, it's what used to be known as a white elephant,” Shibli told Scoreboard. “Having stripped out the Trojan horse argument — is it really an interesting product for people to watch across the globe?”</p> <p>The Commonwealth Games will return in 2026, and there are hopes for a potential centenary event in Hamilton, Canada, where the competition first began. But its long-term future looks in serious doubt. </p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Formula 1</strong>‘s <strong>Toto Wolff</strong> sits down for this week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a91e9ca9-8d8c-4d5a-a289-fc20bda36df1\">Lunch with the FT</a>.
