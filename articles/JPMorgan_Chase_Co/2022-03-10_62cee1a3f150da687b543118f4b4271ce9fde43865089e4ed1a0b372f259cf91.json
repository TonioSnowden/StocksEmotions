  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Amazon <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/da3bb04d-69dd-4b0d-9719-f8dc2d8e6e65\">has announced</a> a 20-for-1 stock split and a share buyback of up to $10bn, in an effort to boost its stock price in the face of heavy operating costs and concerns over staff retention.</p> <h2>Regulators probe Diller and Geffen's lucrative Activision bet&#xa0;</h2> <p>Billionaires <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab6ec72c-c1d1-11e4-bd24-00144feab7de\"><strong>Barry Diller</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/David_Geffen\"><strong>David Geffen</strong></a> made great fortunes uncovering talent in Hollywood, music and technology. </p> <p>Now, their side hustle of sniffing out unannounced corporate takeovers has caught the eye of the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> and <strong>Department of Justice</strong>. </p> <p>The duo purchased $108mn of options contracts tied to video game developer <strong>Activision</strong> on January 14 for about $40 per share, alongside <strong>Alexander von Furstenberg</strong>, Diller's stepson from his marriage to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73594056-5d3f-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98\"><strong>Diane von Furstenberg</strong></a>.</p> <p>Three days later,<strong> Microsoft </strong>announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95e17671-a6ac-4dcc-bae7-e9f34af1349c\">$75bn takeover</a> of Activision for $95 a share, propelling the trio's options to achieve paper gains of roughly $60mn.</p> <p>The trades are so good that they've <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62fb944e-4827-4d90-9cd4-69e0f1f7944d\">become the subject of an insider trading investigation</a> by US regulators, DD's James Fontanella-Khan and Antoine Gara and the FT's Stefania Palma report.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, the bank that the trio used to place their bet, reported them to US authorities after the takeover was announced. JPMorgan declined to comment.</p> <p>Diller told the FT that the trade is clean and was made on the basis of their belief that Activision was undervalued and could eventually be acquired or taken private. </p> <p>“None of us had any knowledge from any person or any source or anything about a potential acquisition of Activision by Microsoft,” he said. </p> <p>The three men purchased in-the-money options contracts versus out-of-money contracts that would have been far more profitable, <strong>Andrew Verstein</strong>, a professor of law at <strong>UCLA</strong>, told DD.</p> <p>But they placed a leveraged bet on Activision, which gave them more upside potential than simply buying the stock, as <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>'s<strong> Berkshire Hathaway</strong> did <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df83a28f-4d65-483f-acc9-97466c120e91\">in the lead up</a> to the deal.</p> <p>“It is suspicious when a person buys an aggressive derivatives-based bet in an unannounced merger,” said Verstein. “Most rich people don't do that.”</p> <p>Diller told the FT that his lawyers have preserved all documents of their trade “because we were sure somebody would say, ‘well, how could this be such a coincidence?' It turns out, that's all it is.”</p> <p>Diller is a friend of Activision's chief executive <strong>Bobby Kotick</strong> and is the founder of media group <strong>IAC</strong>, which has backed various internet media brands including <strong>Tinder</strong> and <strong>Expedia</strong>.</p> <p>If Diller's version of events prevails, he and Geffen have pulled off one of the great trades of 2022.</p> <h2>H2O plays Russian roulette&#xa0;</h2> <p>How do you explain to your investors that you just incinerated 40 per cent of their money on a leveraged bet on the Russian rouble?</p> <p>That's the unique quandary facing <strong>H2O Asset Management</strong>, the accident-prone investment firm that still manages nearly €14bn in assets despite its recent scandals.</p> <p>Regular DD readers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6bc5882-9a0a-406e-a36b-7c91f5526d02\">will know H2O</a> as a fallen star of European asset management that has lurched from crisis to crisis since the summer of 2019, when the FT revealed that its funds held <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51b425fc-94b6-3cc5-a4ea-47d72dca5e75\">more than €1bn of bonds</a> linked to controversial financier<strong> Lars Windhorst</strong>.</p> <p>H2O's founders <strong>Bruno Crastes</strong> and <strong>Vincent Chailley</strong> make no bones about their penchant for high-risk, high-reward bets. Crastes once even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10bc7016-063d-4b02-adfe-4545f790ffcd\">told a crowd</a> of fellow investment professionals that their industry had become “corrupted by all this regulation and all this risk management”.</p> <p>Even so, DD did a double take when we saw that H2O's flagship fund had exposure to the Russian rouble through derivatives — equivalent to more than 48 per cent of its €1.9bn in assets — just weeks before Russian tanks crossed the border to invade Ukraine.</p> <p>The results have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63c8dbc5-f8cb-4db7-b504-3b37409437b3\">disastrous</a>. And yet, the firm has outlined the unique reasons why it's clinging on for a rebound.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8923463.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In a letter to investors last week, H2O said selling the rouble would be a “gift” to buyers including “the Russian government”. (H2O posted an amended version to its website on Monday excluding the word “gift”.)</p> <p>Then on Tuesday, Chailley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94d2ee7c-a6a4-45fa-9101-161b49cb2c6c\">explained in a video address</a> to investors that the group's team expects the currency to rebound because there will be a “negotiation [between Russia and Ukraine] that will start in the coming weeks”.</p> <p>“Putin knows and said very consistently what he wants to achieve,” he added, before explaining that H2O would adjust the portfolio if there was a further “escalation” in the war.</p> <p>As a reminder, Putin has said consistently that he wants to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0783ea10-b493-4889-8da8-5a5ea75cb977\">“demilitarise and de-Nazify”</a> Ukraine. We're not sure if Chailley is hoping to profit from this process, because H2O declined to comment on his remarks beyond confirming their accuracy.</p> <p>In an age of faddish ESG investing, perhaps some may consider such honesty refreshing. </p> <p>However, we also noticed that H2O's website explains that it is “currently working on our firm-wide ESG policy”. Clearly there's more to be done on that front.</p> <h2>The trading scandal that shook Japan Inc</h2> <p>When Japan's financial regulators raided the offices of the country's third-largest broker <strong>SMBC Nikko </strong>last year in a probe into alleged market manipulation, they didn't stop after going through the files of the company's traders on the premises.</p> <p>They went to the bankers' homes, going through their personal phones and computers, and called in senior staff for questioning. </p> <p>One June weekend, shortly after multiple interrogation sessions that lasted up to 10 hours, a senior trader died of a brain aneurysm, with Nikko <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33c9f47c-d55e-4b74-a3a2-7043f4a67bd5\">lodging a complaint</a> to the regulators that centred on the stress caused by the investigation. (The FT's Antoni Slodkowski breaks down the implications on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slodek/status/1501401562068881412\">this Twitter thread</a>.)</p> <p>The probe has since been taken over by the prosecutors who have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4c71489-2401-4968-a79d-6f2731c41b9a\">arrested four executives</a>, including two foreigners, the head of Nikko's equity business, <strong>Trevor Hill</strong> and his deputy, <strong>Alexandre Avakiants</strong>.</p> <p>At the heart of the allegations against them are trades executed by the firm's proprietary trading desk to allegedly boost the price of stocks being sold by institutions as large blocks.</p> <p>The arrests, which have sent shockwaves through Tokyo's financial community, have drawn attention because of how rare it is for prosecutors to get involved — and arrest the executives — when the company under investigation is a domestic brokerage.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Eurazeo </strong>has appointed <strong>JCDecaux</strong> co-chief<strong> Jean-Charles Decaux</strong> as chair of its supervisory board.
