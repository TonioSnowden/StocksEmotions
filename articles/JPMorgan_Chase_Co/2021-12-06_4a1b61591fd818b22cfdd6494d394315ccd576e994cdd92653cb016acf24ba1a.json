  "title": "New York City Sets Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate for Private-Sector Workers; New 'first in the nation' requirement goes into effect later this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio says",
  "text": "<p>\"We've got Omicron as a new factor. We've got the colder weather, which is going to really create additional challenges with the Delta variant. We've got holiday gatherings,\" Mr. de Blasio said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" where he announced the new mandate. \"We in New York City have decided to use a pre-emptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid.\"</p><p>The city will also require children ages 5 through 11, who recently became eligible to get vaccinated against the virus, to have vaccine proof for indoor dining, entertainment and fitness.</p><p>The private-sector vaccine requirement will affect about 184,000 businesses in the city, according to New York City Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi. Mr. de Blasio said the mandate will apply to employees working in person. More details about the rules and how they would be enforced will be released Dec. 15, he said.</p><p>Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group whose members include large companies such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., said many employers in the city were caught off guard by the announcement and its timing.</p><p>\"There's no clarity around who and how this will be enforced,\" Ms. Wylde said in an interview.</p><p>She said some employers asked her on Monday morning if they would need to fire workers who don't comply with the new rules, or if there will be a way for employees to take a test in lieu of vaccinations. She has told them that much remains unclear.</p><p>Adding to the confusion for some, the mandate is slated to take effect just days before Mayor-elect Eric Adams replaces Mr. de Blasio.</p><p>\"The Mayor-elect will evaluate this mandate and other Covid strategies when he is in office and make determinations based on science, efficacy and the advice of health professionals,\" Evan Thies, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, said in a statement Monday.</p><p>New York City, like other parts of the country, has seen newly reported Covid-19 cases rise in recent days as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread. The seven-day average of daily confirmed and probable infections was 1,589 as of Dec. 3, according to the latest data from the city's health department. That was higher than the seven-day average of 1,423 cases a week earlier, and 882 a month earlier.</p><p>Officials are also worried about the potential impact of the Omicron variant. New York state said last week it had detected five Covid-19 cases linked to the new variant, four of which were in New York City residents.</p><p>Drug researchers and health authorities have been racing to figure out how Omicron could affect people, drugs and vaccines. The World Health Organization has said preliminary evidence showed that people previously infected with Covid-19 may be at greater risk of re-infection with Omicron than with other variants. The variant also could be more transmissible than others, the WHO said.</p><p>Almost 78% of New York City residents have gotten at least one vaccine dose and 70% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to data from the city's health department. Ms. Wylde said surveys conducted among the Partnership's members have shown that the vast majority of employees had already been vaccinated.</p><p>The new vaccine mandate could slow return-to-office efforts at a time when New York leaders want more companies to bring workers back, Ms. Wylde said. Some companies had already delayed return-to-office timelines to give them more time to study the Biden administration's vaccine or testing mandate.</p><p>\"The mayor has been eager to support return to the office; this goes in the other direction because it basically confuses the situation more,\" Ms. Wylde said. \"What we need to get people back to the office is confidence in a consistent set of policies coming from all levels of government.\"</p><p>The Biden administration has mandated employers with at least 100 workers to require employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or test negative for it weekly and wear a mask in the workplace. A federal appeals court, however, temporarily blocked the implementation of the rules last month. Small-business owners say they are already preparing for the potential new rules, which could take effect Jan. 4.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio said Monday he was confident the city's new mandate would survive any legal challenges \"because it's universal.\"</p><p>\"I don't know all the intricacies of what the Biden administration has been through, but I do know this: Our Health Commissioner has put a series of mandates in place. They have won in court, state court, federal court, every single time,\" Mr. de Blasio told MSNBC.</p><p>The city in August started requiring people to show proof of vaccination for certain indoor activities, such as going to the gym or eating inside restaurants.</p><p>Even so, the new rules could create \"problematic confrontations\" between employers and workers and spur potential layoffs as some businesses struggle with labor shortages, said Randy Peers, president and chief executive of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>\"With surrounding counties and states unlikely to follow, people will choose to shop and work outside the city, imposing horrific financial consequences on our tax base and our businesses,\" Mr. Peers said.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The mayor has previously said vaccine mandates are needed to keep people safe and help the city's economic recovery.</p><p>â€”Allison Prang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>New York City Sets Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate for Private-Sector Workers</p>",
