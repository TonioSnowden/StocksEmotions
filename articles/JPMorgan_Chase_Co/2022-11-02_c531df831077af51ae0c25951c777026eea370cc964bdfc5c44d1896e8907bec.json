Estimize is guiding for $1.6 billion.</p><p>Stock movement: DoorDash stock has fallen after reporting earnings in two of the past three quarters, and has risen after five of the seven reports the company has made since going public. DoorDash shares are down almost 70% so far this year through Tuesday's session, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has fallen about 19% year to date.</p><p>What analysts are saying</p><p>Aaron Kessler, an analyst for Raymond James who has a market perform rating on DoorDash stock, said food delivery user growth is slow \"given the tough comps from 2021.\" He said data shows that DoorDash's U.S. daily average users increased just 4% year over year, compared with a rise of 13% in the second quarter, and declined 3% quarter over quarter.</p><p>Doug Anmuth, an analyst for JPMorgan who has a neutral rating on the company's stock, said DoorDash's gross order value \"has room to grow,\" and noted that \"COVID-19 tailwinds may not be sustainable.\"</p><p>He also said that profitability for Europe-based delivery company Wolt, which DoorDash bought last year, could take time and put pressure on margins in the near term. Kessler estimates that Wolt saw an 18% increase year over year but a 5% decline in orders quarter over quarter.</p><p>Overall, though, Anmuth wrote that he is \"positive on DASH's value proposition and execution, but need more disclosure around core U.S. restaurant profitability, and path to profitability for growth segments to become more positive.\"</p><p>DoorDash earnings: What to expect</p>",
