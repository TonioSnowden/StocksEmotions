Meanwhile, the number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, rose by 62,000 to 1.67 million, the highest reading since February.

Last week, data showing hotter-than-expected acceleration in wage growth, along with a more robust labor market, sent stocks sharply lower as investors surmised that the Fed's efforts to counter inflation were not having their intended effect.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that unemployment will likely need to rise in order for the Fed to succeed in suppressing the worst inflationary wave in four decades. The Fed is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points when it meets next week from December 13-14.</p><p>See: JPMorgan looks at 'Armageddon scenario' of Fed jacking rates up to 6.5%.
