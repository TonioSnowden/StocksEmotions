  "title": "Natural gas-focused methane pact expands at climate summit, minus China; Reducing leaks of methane — a main component of the natural gas used for electricity and more than one-third of U.S. stoves — could save valuable degrees of global warming",
  "text": "<p>With the pledge, countries representing 45% of global methane emissions have vowed to reduce their emissions by 30% by 2030.</p><p>The methane pact was introduced and pushed by the United States and the European Union at last year's COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, with about 100 countries signed up in its earliest days. China, the world's largest polluter by some measures, has not signed the deadline-based pledge, but has agreed to reduce methane emissions.</p><p>With the world's population expanding, and much of the global economy returning to business as usual after the worst of the COVID-19 shutdown, methane emissions are still rising. In 2021, methane's atmospheric levels increased to 1,908 parts per billion, the highest levels in at least 800,000 years. Last year's increase of 18 parts per billion was the biggest on record.</p><p>If methane-reduction pledges are met, the result would be equivalent to eliminating the greenhouse gas emissions from all of the world's cars, trucks, buses and all two- and three-wheeled vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>Read: JPMorgan Chase and 5 other U.S. megabanks behind one-third of global funding to expand coal, oil and gas</p><p>The pledge targets climate-damaging leaks, venting and flaring from natural gas industriesNG00. Kerry said it will also target natural gas emitted in the agriculture and waste industries, through such methods as altering the diets of cattle and pigs, which pass the gas into the air through burps and flatulence.</p><p>Kerry and the European Union's top climate official, Frans Timmermans, said the pledge focuses on simple fixes, such as tightening leaky wellheads, to achieve big reductions in methane emissions, which are for more potent than carbon dioxide.</p><p>In fact, over 20 years, methane causes 85 times more warming than the same amount of carbon dioxide. But methane doesn't stay in the atmosphere as long as CO2, so stopping methane leaks today can have a fast impact on lowering global temperatures.</p><p>\"If we do these simple things the baseline assessment indicates we can avoid 0.2 Celsius in global warming in atmosphere between 2040 and 2070,\" the EU's Timmermans said. \"Every decimal less warming will be important, crucial even.\"</p><p>Eyes on China</p><p>China is by far the world's largest methane emitter. It has not signed the Global Methane Pledge, though last year it did sign the bilateral U.S.-China Glasgow Declaration on climate action, where both countries agreed to develop a national action plan for \"methane control and reductions in the 2020s.\"</p><p>China has not yet revealed the details of its draft plan, but a Chinese official at the COP27 currently underway signaled that a preliminary plan has been written.</p><p>\"We're making progress on methane, and there's wide recognition of the imperative to lower methane levels, but we're not going fast enough,\" said Daphne Wysham, CEO of Methane Action, a Washington State-based advocacy group.</p><p>\"To keep 1.5 alive, we'll need more than voluntary frameworks and preliminary plans. We need a binding agreement, with targets and timetables for getting record-high atmospheric methane concentrations back down to preindustrial levels,\" she said.</p><p>Gas industry incentives for change</p><p>Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it can leak anywhere along the supply chain, from the wellhead and processing plant, through pipelines and distribution lines, all the way to the burner of your home's stove or furnace.</p><p>Natural gas, which is relatively cheaper to produce than other fossil fuels, has been the major alternative to more-polluting coal in electricity generation. It also functions as part of an established pipeline infrastructure, and is pushed by the industry as a viable alternative alongside solar, wind ICLN and other means.</p><p>Nationwide, electricity is the most common energy source used for cooking — electricity often powered by gas. Still, about 38% of U.S. households use natural gas directly for cooking, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Read: The bitter breakup with gas stoves is getting closer — here's another reason why</p><p>And: Another reason to swap your gas stove? Study finds cancer-causing chemicals in natural gas</p><p>There are a number of voluntary industry-led efforts to reduce methane emissions, and a number of individual companies have announced methane reduction targets in the past year, the IEA says, though it, too, has pushed for more universal rules and regulated score-keeping of these efforts.</p><p>The American Gas Association, a trade group representing energy companies that deliver natural gas, mostly to utilities, says industry changes to date are making a difference. A concerted effort by natural gas utilities to upgrade our nation's pipeline network to enhance safety has also reduced methane emissions by 73% according to the 2020 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, AGA said in a release.</p><p>Related: Biden's climate envoy Kerry gives natural gas a 10-year expiration date</p><p>Some experts see an incentive for the oil CL00 and gas industry to robustly tackle methane emissions.</p><p>\"There's also another reason for the methane focus, and it makes this strategy more likely to succeed: Stopping methane leaks from the oil and gas industry can largely pay for itself and boost the amount of fuel available,\" said Jim Krane, fellow for energy studies at the Baker Institute for Public Policy and a lecturer at Rice University's Jones Graduate School of Business, in a commentary.</p><p>Nearly all of these emissions can be stopped with new components or regulations that prohibit routine flaring, he said. Global oil and gas operations emitted more methane in 2021 than Canada consumed that entire year, according to IEA estimates.</p><p>If that gas were captured, at current U.S. prices — $4 per million British thermal unit — that wasted methane would fetch around $17 billion. The IEA determined that a one-time investment of $11 billion would eliminate roughly 75% of methane leaks worldwide, along with an even larger amount of gas that is wasted by \"flaring\" or burning it off at the wellhead.</p><p>\"The repairs and infrastructure investments would not only reduce warming, but they would also generate profits for producers KMI LNGand provide direly needed natural gas to markets undergoing drastic shortages due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" Krane said.</p><p>Listen: How Russia's power play will hit consumers and reshape energy markets</p><p>Natural gas-focused methane pact expands at climate summit, minus China</p>",
