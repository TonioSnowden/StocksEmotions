  "title": "Biden Expected to Nominate Wall Street Critic as Top Banking Regulator; Cornell law professor Saule Omarova will be named Comptroller of the Currency, say people familiar with the matter",
  "text": "<p>A formal announcement could come this week, the people said.</p><p>A White House spokeswoman declined to comment. Ms. Omarova didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Bloomberg News reported earlier on the expected nomination.</p><p>The OCC is an independent bureau of the Treasury Department. It oversees about 1,200 banks with total assets of $14 trillion, some two-thirds of the total in the U.S. banking system, making it one of the most powerful regulators alongside the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p><p>The powerful Comptroller of the Currency has a seat on the board of the FDIC as well as on the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of senior regulators charged with detecting risks to the financial system. The bulk of the job revolves around supervising the day-to-day operations of the world's largest banks.</p><p>A native of Kazakhstan, if confirmed Ms. Omarova would be the first woman to serve as the full-time comptroller to run the 3,500-strong agency since Abraham Lincoln signed it into law in 1863.</p><p>She would likely work to help fulfill Mr. Biden's campaign push to expand access to banking services in underserved communities. As part of that effort, she would help lead a planned overhaul of the rules for the Community Reinvestment Act, a decades-old law governing hundreds of billions of dollars in lending and investment in low-income areas.</p><p>On Twitter, Ms. Omarova criticized this summer's end to temporary restrictions on big bank share buybacks and dividends after the banks performed well in annual stress tests.</p><p>In a separate tweet, she criticized a news report on acquisitions by JPMorgan. \"Does the world need JPMorgan to grow bigger or more powerful? Just wondering,\" she wrote.</p><p>In academic writing, Ms. Omarova has called for a shift of consumer banking deposits from private firms to the Federal Reserve and called to \"effectively end banking as we know it.\"</p><p>The same 2020 paper endorsed steps to \"radically redefine the role of a central bank as the ultimate public platform for generating, modulating, and allocating financial resources in a democratic economyâ€”the People's Ledger.\"</p><p>The pick is expected to be cheered by progressive Democrats who support her criticism of banking and is likely to meet opposition from Republicans and industry groups.</p><p>A Republican Senate aide said GOP lawmakers are concerned that her views are \"far to the left of anyone we've seen in the regulatory space.\"</p><p>The Biden administration has struggled to find a comptroller nominee who would be embraced by its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. Earlier this year, the White House abandoned a former Obama-era Treasury official it had eyed for the post after he drew opposition from progressive Democrats. Several other people were considered for the role but never nominated.</p><p>Michael Hsu, a former Fed staffer, has been serving as acting comptroller since May.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Expected to Nominate Wall Street Critic as Top Banking Regulator</p>",
