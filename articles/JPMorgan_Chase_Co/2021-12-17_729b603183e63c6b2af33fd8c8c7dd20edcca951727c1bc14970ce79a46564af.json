  "text": "<p>The Omicron variant has sent cases of Covid-19 sharply up, with New York state hitting a daily record of 21,027 in confirmed new cases Friday.</p><p>Most of JPMorgan's staff has been in the office regularly since July. The bank didn't bend much to the earlier spike in Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant this fall. But with rising cases jeopardizing holiday plans, JPMorgan is joining other banks in allowing staff to work from home full time. The bank also urged staffers to cancel work-related holiday parties and dinners where masking is difficult.</p><p>\"By minimizing any potential exposure now, you'll reduce the risk of missing out on holiday gatherings with friends and family,\" the memo said.</p><p>Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. have taken similar steps. Other parts of corporate America are also pushing back office-reopening plans.</p><p>The JPMorgan memo urged employees to get tested before returning to work in January.</p><p>The bank earlier this week moved its annual healthcare conference to a virtual setting said employees and guests must be vaccinated to enter its New York offices.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan Allows Employees to Work From Home for Rest of Year</p>",
