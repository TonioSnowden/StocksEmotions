  "text": "<p>Stock-market bulls are looking for corporate earnings reports to take the focus away from the surge in inflation that has ratcheted up Federal Reserve interest rate-hike expectations and has sent Treasury yields sharply higher so far this year.</p><p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 203 points or 0.6%, at 34,423.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 36 points, or 0.8%, at 4,433.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP jumped 225 points, or 1.7%, to 13,596.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite erased strong early gains to end lower.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Treasury yields were in retreat Wednesday, providing some support for technology stocks and the Nasdaq Composite index as investors wagered on a peak in U.S. inflation, despite a rise in March wholesale prices.</p><p>The U.S. producer price index, which measures the cost of wholesale goods and services, jumped 1.4% in March largely because of higher gas and food prices, signaling that U.S. inflation is likely to stay near a 40-year high through the spring. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 1.1% gain. The increase in wholesale prices over the past year jumped to 11.2%, from 10% in the prior month — the highest level since the early 1980s.</p><p>The PPI reading comes a day after the U.S. Labor Department reported the strongest year-over-year rise in U.S. consumer prices in 40 years, at 8.5%. The CPI data showed a 0.9% drop in durable-goods inflation, at the same time there was a 0.7% gain in services inflation, both evidence of a normalizing economy after pandemic supply disruptions.</p><p>“These core inflation dynamics suggest that underlying price pressures are peaking in the U.S.,” said analysts at BCA Research.</p><p>Read: This stock-market indicator says investors don't think inflation has peaked: analyst</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday that she was more worried about the prospects of a recession in Europe, given the impact of the war in Ukraine, but that the Federal Reserve also would need luck and skill to maintain a strong labor market while bringing inflation down. “It has been done in the past. It's not an impossible combination,” Yellen said, in a talk at the Atlantic Council.</p><p>The U.K. reported the fastest inflation rate in 30 years, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made a bigger-than-forecast half percentage point interest rate hike. The Bank of Canada also raised its benchmark interest rates by a half point Wednesday.</p><p>Meanwhile, the first-quarter U.S. earnings reporting season got underway as investors digested results from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, as well as Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, BlackRock Inc.BLK, and others.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase shares fell 4% to lead Dow decliners after the bank reported lower first-quarter profit that missed Wall Street's estimate, and cast some gloom on the financial sector.</p><p>“JP Morgan's Q1 earnings are the fairly dull bookend to a golden two-year period in banking,” said Octavio&#xa0;Marenzi, CEO of Opimas LLC, a capital markets consulting firm, in emailed comments.</p><p>“During the pandemic, [return on equity] hovered close to 20%. Investment banking and trading did magnificently well, while loan losses remained extremely low. Now, with rising interest rates, JP Morgan's earnings got clobbered, falling by over 40%. This is going to be the new normal in banking for the foreseeable future,” he said.</p><p>Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that consensus earnings expectations for the S&amp;P 500 this year have actually moved higher, to $230 in April from $224 in January.</p><p>“Given the myriad headwinds faced by companies in the first quarter and the year ahead, we think first-quarter reporting season has the potential to be a mess. But we also see the potential for it to not be as bad as feared, given the likelihood that buy-side expectations are much lower than official sell-side forecasts – as long as robust assessments of underlying appetite/demand remain in place,” she said.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>Shares of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, were flat after it reported net income that topped expectations.</p><p>Delta shares rose 4.3% after reporting stronger-than-forecast results, lifting other airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.AAL, which was up 8.9%. The popular U.S. Global Jets ETFJETS rose 4.4%.</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.BBBY advanced 3% after the retailer reported a surprise fourth-quarter loss and missed on sales.</p><p>How other assets are trading</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell 6 basis points to 2.67%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.4%.</p><p>Bitcoin BTCUSD rose 5% to trade back above $41,000.</p><p>Oil futures extended a rebound to push the U.S. benchmark CL.1 up 2.4% to trade near $103 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 were up 0.4% above $1,983 an ounce, on track for a fifth straight daily gain.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP ended fractionally higher, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX was up 0.1%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP fell 0.8%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 0.3% in Hong Kong and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK jumped 1.9%.</p><p>––Steve Goldstein contributed reporting</p>",
