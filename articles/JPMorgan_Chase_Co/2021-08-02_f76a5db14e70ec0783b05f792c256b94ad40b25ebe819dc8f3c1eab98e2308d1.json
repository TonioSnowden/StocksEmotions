  "text": "<p>Investors are pushing back at the riskiest US loans, demanding better terms in a sign that fund managers are becoming more picky in a deluge of deals.</p> <p>Most deals are still sailing through the market with rampant demand, while companies refinance old loans at rock-bottom interest rates and private equity groups load up on cheap debt to fund acquisitions. But the average price of new loans in July dipped to 99.22 cents on the dollar from 99.33 cents in June, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, the biggest discount since December. </p> <p>The forward loan calendar, an indication of the amount of debt expected still to be raised in the market, rose to over $50bn this month for the first time since January 2020. The dip in price at the same time reflects confidence among investors that with opportunities continuing to roll in, they can be more choosy on which deals to buy. </p> <p>“When the market is as busy as it is now and there is plenty to choose from, the companies with a harder story to tell need to offer better pricing,” said Jeff Bakalar, head of leveraged credit at Voya Investment Management. “Deals are still getting done. Someone is willing to take the risk. It just has to be at a better price.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Lowly-rated SVP Worldwide last week borrowed $370m to fund Platinum Equity taking a majority stake in the holding company that owns sewing machine brands Singer and Viking. The company had a bumper 2020, with the number of new people taking up sewing doubling during Covid-19 lockdowns compared with a normal year, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings.&#xa0;</p> <p>However, rating agencies and investors expect the reopening of global economies to cool further growth. Doubts over whether the sewing craze will last eventually pushed the price of the loan to 93 cents on the dollar from 98 cents after a protracted three weeks of negotiation with bankers at Bank of America, who led the deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The company lacks meaningful scale and is narrowly focused in a mature industry that could revert to sub-par growth once global economies reopen,” noted S&amp;P analysts in a ratings report.&#xa0;</p> <p>Commercial roofing and cladding contractor Flynn Group also faced pushback on its proposed $300m loan to fund share buybacks, a dividend to its owners and debt repayments. JPMorgan, which led the syndication of the loan, eventually cut its size to $250m, with the price dropping to 97 cents on the dollar from 99.5 cents when it was first marketed to investors.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pharmaceutical company Alvogen Pharma borrowed $160m at the end of last week, with bankers at Jefferies selling the loan at a price of 96.25 cents on the dollar.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bank of America declined to comment. Platinum Equity, SVP Worldwide, Flynn Group, Alvogen, JPMorgan and Jefferies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>John Gregory, head of leveraged finance capital markets&#xa0;at Wells Fargo, said that with so little resistance from yield hungry investors for most of the year, banks had become “fearless” in their attempts to syndicate lower quality loans, with the handful of loans facing pushback standing in contrast to most deals still benefiting from high demand.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The deals struggling in the market don't have the credit quality people are looking for,” he said. “I think underwriters might have gotten carried away.”</p><p>Source: Joe Rennison in New York 2021 'Risky US loans face pushback from investors spoilt for choice' FT.com 2 August.
