  "title": "U.K. Markets Are On Sale. Nobody Wants to Buy. Valuations on U.K. stocks and bonds are at historic lows, but investors are wary over government borrowing plans and the end to the BOE's bond buying",
  "text": "<p>Investors yanked a net total of $3.7 billion from U.K. stock mutual and exchange-traded funds in Septemberâ€”an all-time monthly record, according to fund-flow tracker EPFR. And redemptions in October haven't slowed so far.</p><p>Meanwhile, a September survey from BofA Global Research showed fund managers are the most underweight U.K. stocks in nearly two years. Sentiment also isn't looking much better for the British pound, which has seen continued bearish wagers against it.</p><p>\"It's an untouchable market right now,\" said Viraj Patel, a London-based global macro strategist at Vanda Research. \"You could easily make a case where things get progressively worse from here.\"</p><p>Investors had already been retreating from U.K. assets in recent months as they weighed risks building in the economy. These include decades-high inflation, growing risk of a recession and a looming energy crisis.</p><p>The unveiling of the largest tax cuts in the U.K. since the 1970s kicked investor skittishness into overdrive. Ms. Truss decided Friday to reverse crucial parts of the tax proposal and fire Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng.</p><p>On Monday, his replacement, Jeremy Hunt, said he was reversing nearly all of the government's proposed tax cuts and would pare back an energy price cap. Speaking before an emergency statement to Parliament on the economy, he said \"the most important objective for our country right now is stability.\"</p><p>Investors welcomed the Treasury chief's announcement, with stocks, bonds and the British pound all rising on Monday. The yield on the 10-year gilt fell to 3.958% after trading most of last week above 4%. Yields fall when bond prices rise. Meanwhile, the British pound advanced 0.8% against the dollar to $1.1305. The benchmark FTSE 100 gained 0.8%.</p><p>Still, investors and strategists say they are bracing for more uncertainty. The Bank of Englandwrapped up its government bond purchase program Friday, marking the final opportunity for pension funds to unload long-dated bonds to the central bank. Some market-watchers said they were worried that could stir volatility anew.</p><p>On paper, U.K. stocks, bonds and the currency look inexpensive on a historic basis. The FTSE 100 on Thursday traded at 8.8 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to data from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. that is lower than 15.7 for the S&amp;P 500 and the 11.2 multiple for an MSCI Europe index that excludes the U.K.</p><p>The difference between yields on U.K. government debt and U.S. or German debt are at their widest in at least a decade, according to FactSet.</p><p>Regardless of the low valuations, turmoil in the new British government only reinforced the decision to stay away, said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, which manages about 67 billion Swiss francs (about $67 billion).</p><p>Among his concerns: The conflict the Bank of England has faced in trying to ease and tighten monetary policy at the same time. Throughout this year, the Bank has raised interest rates to combat inflation and planned to begin selling its holdings of gilts, as government bonds are known, to tighten money supply.</p><p>But the market turmoil forced the central bank to put those bond-selling plans on hold. Instead, the BOE felt compelled to intervene and begin buying bonds to stabilize the markets.</p><p>\"Those elements are completely incompatible,\" Ms. Ielpo said, noting that while U.K. stocks trade at a large discount, he views few opportunities. \"We don't think valuations are a relevant indication\" for U.K. equities.</p><p>Another factor keeping investors away has been the large swings in markets. The pound has moved more than 1% up or down on roughly half the days in the past 16 trading days, according to FactSet. On Friday, yields on the 30-year gilt, a favorite of the pension funds at the heart of the recent bond-market turmoil, swung 0.66 percentage point in a single day, the type of move that outside of the past few weeks would normally take months to play out.</p><p>To be sure, heavy pessimism can also be its own attraction for investors. JPMorgan's prime-brokerage arm has recently seen buyers scooping up larger, U.K.-based companies that derive much of their revenue internationally, according to Eloise Goulder, head of the global market, data and positioning intelligence teams in equity trading at the bank. However, she said, flows into domestically focused U.K. companies remain sparse.</p><p>Market sentiment in the U.K. is very low, she said. \"Far lower than for the other major regions we track.\"</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Markets Are On Sale.
