The incident echoed a bungling of the initial vaccine announcement in November when AstraZeneca and developers at Oxford university reported confusing data about efficacy. </p> <p>The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had hoped the trial results would end speculation that the jab could cause blood clots, which led several countries in Europe to suspend its rollout and caused jitters in the developing world where it is a central element of vaccination programmes. </p> <p>AstraZeneca has also been locked in a supply dispute with the EU, which says the company is not honouring its commitments and so should not be exporting outside the bloc to places such as the UK. Remarks from prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f139aed7-619f-4ce6-88ac-50d798b924fc\">Boris Johnson</a> that the UK's successful vaccination rollout was down to “greed” and “capitalism” will do little to ease tensions.&#xa0;</p> <p>European leaders — who meet tomorrow to discuss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74e30a00-37aa-414b-8200-40ed91767089\">export curbs</a> — are angry that factories in the bloc have been exporting doses overseas while the EU has received none from elsewhere. Inspectors today identified a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48b28b7e-9161-47a4-9c37-cf89fea2bc12\">stockpile</a> of 29m AstraZeneca doses in Italy that would be blocked if intended for outside the EU. &#xa0;</p> <p>The European Commission proposals, published ahead of tomorrow's meeting, enhance the existing authorisation scheme, allowing exports to be blocked even if the company was meeting its contractual commitments to Brussels and also if the recipient country already had a good supply of shots or was far ahead of the EU in vaccinating its population. </p> <p>The proposals are not specifically aimed at the UK, which heavily relies on EU deliveries, but at all countries that restrict vaccine exports to the bloc, encouraging them to do more to share their own production. Some argue export bans are not needed: only one shipment has so far been blocked — a delivery of AstraZeneca shots from Italy to Australia — while 381 have gone ahead as planned.&#xa0; </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>The US stimulus programme is fuelling optimism for growth, but risks remain from the uneven introduction of vaccines, changes in business models and increasing political tensions. Chief economics commentator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf2d5ad5-2b60-4398-a6d3-cbec8716d9ec\">Martin Wolf</a> takes stock of the <strong>global recovery.</strong></p> <p>Economics reporter Valentina Romei analyses the state of the <strong>UK economy</strong> on the first anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec7ba8d9-8319-4cb2-9173-a658d9d6736c\">lockdown</a> as the biggest drop in output for more than 300 years is compounded by the effect of Brexit on trade. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4098913e-7eca-4d71-a657-60f940a74f48\">Inflation</a> slowed down in February from 0.7 per cent to 0.4 per cent, according to data this morning, but is expected to rise as the economy reopens. A successful vaccination campaign is injecting hope into the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c5faedb-247e-46ac-89c8-7fb1306c2c7d\">labour market</a> and Britain's dominant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/806288be-2c41-4750-8e68-c001546999a1\">services sector</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic, along with Brexit tensions in Europe, renewed aggravation between the US and China and the blocking of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eec9f3a6-2817-45f5-b007-a290f3e530c6\">Suez Cana</a>l has laid bare the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6458318f-deb8-48c4-8d79-d73acb3401e3\">problems</a> in <strong>supply chains</strong>. Read the first part of our special report: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/rethinking-supply-chains\">Rethinking supply chains</a>. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Private equity group KKR is working with BMG, one of the world's largest music companies, on a hunt for <strong>music labels and catalogues </strong>as consumers become more willing to pay for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cf2d759-5f44-486b-a6d4-b0892d51a63a\">streaming services</a> during the pandemic. Although notoriously ungenerous for most artists, streaming — which accounts for 62 per cent of global music sales — could help some offset the loss of touring income. Overall, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ac93b24-d986-4cea-8802-85606d4cbb9f\">music industry</a> revenues last year hit their highest levels since 2002.</p> <p><strong>Investment banking</strong> remains something of a sweatshop, writes chief business commentator Brooke Masters on the revelations that some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19a14cad-b5fc-4fc3-aa5a-ca306af5b831\">Goldman Sachs</a> juniors were working 95-hour weeks. “Remote work has been a disaster for banks and other businesses that rely on an apprenticeship model,” Brooke argues, as the pandemic intensifies tensions between old-style tough management and the more balanced approach expected by millennial and Gen Z workers.</p> <p>The Covid-19 horror movie may soon be over: <strong>Cineworld</strong> will reopen US cinemas next month and UK venues in April, expecting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d0db11c-23ec-4acc-a8d7-5cf82ef62ea1\">“business as normal”</a> by the fourth quarter. Investors were less convinced by the timetable and sent the group's shares down 8 per cent.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>New fears about <strong>rising infections</strong> in Europe have put the brakes on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7bc385a-de13-4f4c-94c5-ad1045ce8426\">“reopening trade”</a>, hitting shares in companies expecting to profit from the return to “normality” and reanimating sectors such as tech that had benefited from lockdown and remote working.</p> <p>Banks including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Barclays still believe in the emergence of an <strong>oil supercycle </strong>where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4e155b5-ac1a-43cb-921a-e4128917b491\">demand outstrips supply</a>, despite the current “correction” in recent weeks that has seen prices fall because of vaccination slowdowns and renewed lockdowns. “This could end up being quite constructive&#xa0;for the price as it keeps the brakes on capital, which is what you need for a supercycle to develop,” said a JPMorgan analyst. </p> <p><strong>Stock pickers</strong> such as hedge funds and actively managed share portfolios, outgunned in recent years by passive investment methods, could benefit from the global recovery, says US investment editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dda3aa9-10e6-4620-b1b7-efed6c314302\">Michael Mackenzie</a>. “The long-term trends of technology and disruption are accelerating and the challenge for stock pickers is distinguishing how Covid transforms companies,” said an executive at BlackRock.</p> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>For reasons obvious to CBU readers, booking a summer holiday in Europe this year is fraught with risk. Money Mentor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7014833c-cb04-48c6-9a65-0f7b23be25fb\">Lindsay Cook</a> guides you through the options for <strong>travel insurance</strong>.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Katsuwonus comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72feaabd-5f94-40ad-9073-0178db969b23?commentID=e7425866-1dab-464d-a49e-17990c41b962\">Unvaccinated sailors risk deepening global supply chain crisis</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Seamen are frontline workers and deserve the same priority as healthcare workers, carers and others that have been prioritised by governments. They are the largely unsung heroes that have kept the wheels of trade turning over the past year. The flag states of their ships should be responsible to vaccinate them, but with so many vessels registered to flags of convenience, some of them mini-states with no vaccines yet, it won't happen. Yet another example of what is wrong with flags of convenience.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Whether celebrating the relaxation of lockdowns or in need of solace from further restrictions, a <strong>glass of wine</strong> always helps.
