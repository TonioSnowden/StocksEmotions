  "title": "Bank of America Fed Outlook Gets More Hawkish Amid Inflation Worries; Bank's chief global economist forecasts seven rate rises over course of 2022, while trimming growth outlook for year",
  "text": "<p>\"The Fed has all but admitted that it is behind the curve\" when it comes to controlling inflation, and this monetary policy path \"should affect the economy with a lag, weighing on 2023 growth,\" Mr. Harris wrote. He said in his note he had trimmed his growth outlook for this year to a 3.6% increase, and he now sees inflation, stripped of food and energy costs, of 3% over 2022, up from a prior estimate of 2.6%.</p><p>At its December meeting, the Fed pointed to the possibility of three rate rises this year. A number of Fed officials have affirmed that they see three rate increases, although some officials, like St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard, reckons four rate rises could be appropriate, while Fed governor Christopher Waller said even more increases are on the table.</p><p>J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli said in a note to clients Friday his bank also expects more increases out of the central bank. \"We are revising our Fed call to look for five rate hikes this year (previously four hikes), though we are now looking for only three hikes next year, one less than our prior expectations,\" he wrote.</p><p>Also weighing in, Evercore ISI said data released Friday support an outlook of five rate rises, but there is a risk that the Fed could raise rates six or seven times depending on inflation.</p><p>The central driver in the Fed's policy outlook is inflation that is both higher and longer-lasting than the central bank's officials had expected. The Fed's concern about price pressures is such that it accelerated the end of its bond-buying program, and at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, the central bank strongly signaled it would raise rates in March.</p><p>On Friday, the government reported that the Fed's preferred inflation barometer, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, hit a 5.8% overall rise in December, the highest level since the early 1980s, with prices stripped of food and energy factors up by 4.9%. Meanwhile, employers spent 4% more on wages and benefits last year, the biggest such gain since 2001.</p><p>\"With both wage and underlying price inflation spiraling out of control, no wonder the Fed is a lot less confident that this surge will be short-lived,\" said economists at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</p><p>What happens after the likely March rate rise is unclear and will be driven by a hard-to-forecast outlook, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a Wednesday press conference, held after the Fed meeting. He also noted the Fed can work to bring inflation under control without harming the labor market, saying \"there's quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market.\"</p><p>Speaking during a National Public Radio interview Friday, Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashakri agreed there is a lot of uncertainty about the outlook, and while tighter monetary policy looms, it is really too soon to say how far the Fed will need to go.</p><p>\"We think a lot of the reason that prices are high right now are temporary factors related to Covid,\" he said on the radio program. Those disruptions could be resolved and take away the need for an aggressive path of action, but it is unclear how that will play out, he said.</p><p>But even in the face of that uncertainty, higher rates are probable. \"The economy is doing well, fundamentally, but it's a little bit imbalanced right now. And we need to bring it back into balance,\" Mr. Kashkari said.</p><p>While the speed with which the Fed is likely to raise rates appears aggressive to some, Deutsche Bank analyst Alan Ruskin said Friday that history tells a different story. Against the Fed's current outlook that could take the fed-funds rate target to 1% or 1.25% by the close of 2022, Mr. Ruskin said that in tightening cycles going back to 1973, the average amount of tightening in the first year was just under 3% and the median just under 2.5%.</p><p>The current median for these cycles \"is roughly double what has been priced in for the first year of tightening in this cycle. What is priced in for the first year of a 2022/23 tightening would represent a very slow start relative to tightening cycles over the last five decades,\" Mr. Ruskin wrote.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
