  "text": "<p>President Xi Jinping's education reforms last year wiped 90 per cent off the value of China's biggest private sector education company, New York-listed New Oriental Education, undoing decades of work by its founder Yu Minhong.</p> <p>When Yu vowed to rise again, few expected the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/801a6ff0-d163-4969-9bc6-d5c40afb8cbc\">godfather of modern Chinese private education</a> to turn to hawking steaks, books and lipstick to rebuild his business empire.</p> <p>Yet livestreaming that combines English training and history lessons with unabashed product sales are central to Yu's pivot from physical classrooms to online services.</p> <p>The popularity of videos by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/dd5495aa-99c1-4e79-b4a6-40a4e8f62879\">New Oriental</a> and its Hong Kong-listed subsidiary Koolearn Technology — with some drawing millions of viewers — has captured the attention of investors and delivered a 125 per cent share price increase in the past three months. </p> <p>Whether Yu is able to rebuild New Oriental's business has now become a litmus test of Beijing's attitude towards companies damaged by Xi's regulatory crackdown.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10706690.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>New Oriental's fortunes may also cast light on whether Chinese entrepreneurs like Yu understand where Beijing's new “red lines” lie since the reassertion of the Chinese Communist party's control over the business landscape. </p> <p>“It is more like a thick band of red line with grey edges,” said Liqian Ren, a China watcher and director at&#xa0;WisdomTree Asset Management in the US. “And the government may push back on the edge.”</p> <p>A year ago, Beijing banned for-profit companies from tutoring primary and middle school students, cratering New Oriental's core revenue stream.</p> <p>The sudden rule change was a warning for companies beyond China's education sector of the potential for Xi's sweeping “common prosperity” policy — which was rolled out in the name of reducing social inequality and reining in big business — to dramatically overhaul an entire industry.</p> <p>Now Citi analysts are among those advising clients that the worst is over for Chinese private education. The US bank has a “buy” rating on New Oriental, after the group laid off 60,000 staff in January and reported a $876mn loss for the six months to November last year.</p> <p>Citi forecasts New Oriental's shares in Hong Kong will recover more than 40 per cent, based in part on the group's ability to use its livestreams to sell merchandise.</p> <p>“We think New Oriental has a visible growth trajectory over the longer-term, aided by robust demand for quality education services in China,” the bank's analysts said.</p> <p>JPMorgan points out that New Oriental's net cash position of about $4.3bn is higher than its current market capitalisation of around $3.9bn. The bank's analysts also said the company's share price, which is still down around 88 per cent from its high in February last year, was “punitive” in the wake of Xi's reforms.</p> <p>“Investors are literally being paid to wait until it completes restructuring . . . and establishes its path to scale and profitability,” a JPMorgan analyst said, noting that the process could take several years.</p> <p>New Oriental declined to comment.</p> <p>Yu, a prolific user of social media, has made it clear that pandemic controls under China's zero-Covid policy continue to have a “high impact” on his business, forcing the suspension of offline classes and a wave of refunds.</p> <p>The 59-year-old has also warned that losses could continue for years. But he is unwavering as he tries to revive the business he started in a single classroom in a rundown Beijing building in 1993.</p> <p>“The most important thing is to ignite the light in children's hearts,” he said in June.</p> <p>The company plans to focus more on education-adjacent businesses, such as livestreaming and book publishing, tutoring for English-language proficiency tests and consulting for admissions into foreign universities, which are activities that Beijing has not banned.</p> <p>However, staff at New Oriental and other large Chinese companies have said they are still trying to gauge the limits of government tolerance.</p> <p>In a move seen by some as signalling a reprieve for private sector companies, Beijing on Thursday issued leading ride-hailing group Didi with a $1.18bn fine for data security violations. The fine appeared likely to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a6b150a-f32e-42d8-8b68-26f3548ad20b\">pave the way</a> for Didi to resume signing up new customers after a year in regulatory purgatory.</p> <p>But Tencent, the Shenzhen-headquartered social network giant that has also been hit by Xi's regulatory storm, has cut its stake in Koolearn amid fears the common prosperity push makes the unfettered consumerism propagated by livestreaming too risky.</p> <p>Controversy involving China's top online sales host Li Jiaqi has fuelled concerns about government controls on livestreaming. Li is known as the “lipstick king” for his make-up marketing to tens of millions of followers on Douyin, China's version of TikTok. But he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/469aa407-9f0e-48a8-8f21-1e78267b3d92\">disappeared from public view</a> after featuring a tank-shaped dessert a day before the June 4 anniversary of the bloody 1989 crackdown on protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</p> <p>New Oriental is not the only corporate victim of the regulatory crackdown to turn to ecommerce livestreaming. Qudian, a Chinese online microlender, also made the move this year. The New York-listed internet finance company, which has seen its market valuation fall $4.2bn since Beijing banned loans to borrowers with no income in December 2017, now aims to become a “food company”. In one marathon 19-hour livestreaming session this month, Qudian founder and chief executive Min Luo sold 9.56mn ready-to-cook dishes.</p> <p>Jing Daily, a specialist publication covering China's luxury market, said New Oriental had been “distinguishing itself” from typical livestreaming with its free English lessons, rather than heavy product discounts. However, the publication also cautioned that “as the livestream industry is saturated in China, the rivalries within it are fierce”.</p> <p>“So far, [New Oriental's] channel has driven substantial social buzz with its unique livestreaming approach. Let's see how long it can sustain the hype,” Jing Daily added.</p> <p>The crackdown on private education companies was part of a broader effort&#xa0;to cut the cost of childcare to boost the country's low birth rate. But demand from Chinese parents for education-related services appears to remain strong amid an ultra-competitive job market and record youth unemployment.</p> <p>One teacher, who asked not to be named but who taught with New Oriental for 10 years, said she had started teaching children “on the side” since the ban, a move that carries immense personal risk.</p> <p>“I have to be very careful choosing parents. If you let in a troublesome parent who ends up reporting you, then you're done,” she said, adding that many more parents wanted to send their children overseas because the new regulations had limited their access to tutors.</p> <p>Still, industry insiders have said lingering regulatory risk means there is little prospect of a return to the golden era of Chinese private education.</p> <p>“Before the regulations changed, the phrase was <em>tangying</em> — lie in bed and win,” the New Oriental teacher said. “For salesmen and saleswomen, all they had to do was sit in the office and wait for clients to come. The days of <em>tangying</em> have passed.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Gloria Li and William Langley in Hong Kong</em></p><p>Source: Edward White in Wellington, Maiqi Ding in Beijing and Eleanor Olcott in London 2022 'Investors bet on redemption for China's godfather of education' FT.com 25 July.
