  "title": "DraftKings Abandons $22 Billion Bid for Entain; U.S. sports-betting operator walks away from offer to buy British competitor, saying decision follows negotiations with Entain's leadership",
  "text": "<p>The Entain deal would have given DraftKings a stake in bricks-and-mortar betting sites in the U.K. through Entain's Ladbrokes and Coral brands. It also would have given DraftKings a foothold in international gambling via Entain's licenses to operate in dozens of countries and through its online technology.</p><p>In the U.S., Entain is also a key partner to one of DraftKings' biggest rivals, MGM Resorts International, which had said that completing the deal would require its support.</p><p>Jason Robins, DraftKing's co-founder, chairman and chief executive, said that DraftKings is confident it can grow rapidly in North America without adding Entain. The company's shares climbed about 6% Tuesday morning, a sign investors were skeptical about the potential deal. Shares had fallen more than 10% since DraftKings confirmed its bid for Entain on Sept. 21.</p><p>DraftKings, which went public in a blank-check merger in April 2020, is riding a wave of growth in sports betting that has followed a 2018 Supreme Court decision that allowed states to legalize sports gambling. Since then, dozens of states have let companies run sportsbooks. Leagues such as Major League Baseball and the National Football League, which once eschewed associations with gambling, have signed partnerships with companies such as DraftKings and competitor FanDuel Inc.</p><p>Since going public in 2020, DraftKings shares have more than doubled.</p><p>The large investment required from DraftKings and the complexity of integrating the two companies would have made finalizing a deal tough, J.P. Morgan analyst Joseph Greff wrote in a note Tuesday morning.</p><p>\"We are not surprised by this outcome, because we viewed this deal as just too complicated to close from the start,\" Mr. Greff wrote.</p><p>Earlier in 2021, Entain rebuffed a proposal from MGM, saying that its offer of Â£8.09 billion, or about $11 billion, wasn't enough. MGM and Entain are partners in the U.S. sports-betting market through BetMGM, a joint venture.</p><p>Entain's London-traded shares fell 6.9% Tuesday. Representatives for the company didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the negotiations.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>DraftKings Abandons $22 Billion Bid for Entain</p>",
