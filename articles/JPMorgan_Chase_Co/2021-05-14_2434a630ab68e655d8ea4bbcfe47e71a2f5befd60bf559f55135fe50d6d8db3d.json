  "text": "<h2>Matthew Moulding: clear improvement</h2> <p>Few companies polarise opinion like THG, Matthew Moulding's £6bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ad84653-e32d-4249-bfb4-b33c88ce4569\">protein powder</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97b541c0-e9b0-4ce1-9a2d-59de40307456\">lucky dip cosmetics box</a> empire. </p> <p>THG this week secured investment from SoftBank in a deal put together by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b29f452a-40c4-4f62-b193-d0c90af84bfe\">Akshay Naheta</a>, the derivatives specialist who also brokered the Japanese group's $1bn bet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\">on Wirecard</a>. SoftBank's vote of confidence marks a rapid turnround in THG's reputation over the past year, at least according to its reviews <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/THG-Reviews-E802179_P11.htm?sort.sortType=OR&amp;sort.ascending=false&amp;filter.iso3Language=eng\">on Glassdoor</a>. </p> <p>THG's overall score on the employee review site has been creeping steadily higher, from a lowly 2.3 stars on average in 2019 to its current rating of 3.6 stars. Grumbles about the Manchester-based company's staff turnover, working hours and frugality have been eclipsed by glowing praise, which often arrives in clusters of six or eight reviews per day.</p> <p>Though THG's Glassdoor listing dates back to 2014, a remarkable 43 per cent of its five-star reviews arrived on the site since the start of 2021 versus just 14 per cent of its one-star reviews. THG said the dramatic improvement reflected better staff engagement and a recently adopted policy of inviting Glassdoor reviews in its exit surveys.</p> <p>Yet opinion remains deeply divided. About three-fifths of reviewers overall have rated THG either five or one star. Fellow retailer Asos earns a <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/ASOS-Reviews-E35373.htm\">similar total rating</a> to THG but on a much more conventional distribution, with its scores crowded in the middle rather than at the extremes. Less than 15 per cent of Glassdoor reviews rate Asos one star, whereas nearly 30 per cent of current and former employees gave THG the lowest score possible. </p> <h2>Jitse Groen: fighting talk</h2> <p>There's no restraining <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46be3f78-e585-4234-989d-5516879062b1\">Jitse Groen</a>. Just Eat Takeaway's chief executive complained <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jitsegroen/status/1392107158867750912\">via Twitter</a> this week about analysts who “can't even do basic maths” and mix up definitions. “At least buy a calculator or be prepared for a good slapping on our next call,” he tweeted. “You are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jitsegroen/status/1392116014893223936\">breaking my brain</a>.”</p> <p>What triggered the outburst? JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Marcus Diebel had started coverage of rival food delivery business Deliveroo with a “neutral” rating. A peer comparison table on page 13 of Diebel's note had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jitsegroen/status/1392725936240533506\">potentially understated</a> Just Eat's projected gross merchandise value.</p> <h2>Siemens: ill winds</h2> <p>Bankers in Frankfurt and London have been investigating options to fix one of the European market's trickiest problems: how to untangle €17bn-valued wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa and Siemens Energy, the gas and power business that Siemens of Germany spun out last year.</p> <p>Siemens Energy has a 67 per cent stake in Siemens Gamesa, which was created in 2017 via a reverse takeover of Gamesa by Siemens Windpower. A streak of profit warnings followed as the German-Spanish management team struggled to impose a chain of command, though the shares remained buoyant on hopes that Siemens Energy would eventually squeeze out minorities. Having a renewables business in the portfolio has been handy for Siemens Energy's green credentials, but the complex ownership structure is a drain on time and resources.</p> <p>With Siemens Gamesa down 35 per cent from January highs, options now under consideration are said to include a full merger. Analysts have questioned whether Siemens Energy has the balance sheet capacity to finance a takeover bid, however, while any nil-premium union would be unpopular among the environmentally focused funds that hold Siemens Gamesa shares. People familiar with the companies said to expect no decision on the way forward before late 2021 at the earliest.</p> <h2>Searle: family jewels</h2> <p>Farewell, Searle. The silverware and jewellery dealer in the City's Royal Exchange will close this summer after 128 years of trading. Launching a “retirement sale”, managing director Nigel Bird said in a letter to customers that the family-run business had no succession plan in place and Covid-19 had accelerated plans to sell.</p> <p>Losing independent traders such as Searle throws into relief The City of London Corporation's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c59d4058-3ec3-4b94-b459-be92e71a91ff\">plans to adapt</a> to a post-pandemic era by offering rent breaks to high-tech industries. How to balance tradition with modernity will be a hot topic on Monday, when the Lord Mayor of London will mark pubs reopening by delivering a barrel of beer by shire horse to the <a href=\"https://www.olddoctorbutlershead.co.uk/\">Old Dr Butler's Head</a> (established 1610).</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'It's like Marmite: THG is loved or hated despite rising approval ratings ' FT.com 14 May.
