  "title": "Cerberus President Zames To Leave",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Zames, who previously served as chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., was hired in 2018 as part of a series of moves at the New York investment firm that included the naming of firm veteran Frank Bruno as co-chief executive alongside co-founder Stephen Feinberg.</p><p>As president, Mr. Zames had broad responsibilities at New York-based Cerberus, which manages over $50 billion in assets across credit, private equity and real estate and is known for investments in struggling companies like Avon Products Inc. He oversaw the firm's investments in the financial-services sector, including big stakes in Germany's Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG.</p><p>With Deutsche Bank, Cerberus took on the unusual role of becoming a paid adviser to the bank. That put Mr. Zames in the position of both trying to fix Deutsche Bank, which had been suffering from years of losses, restructuring, legal fines and management turnover and attempting to salvage Cerberus's investment.</p><p>Cerberus's stake in Deutsche Bank, which it first disclosed in 2017, was valued at less than half of what it paid by the time its advisory relationship with the bank ended in 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported. Recently, Deutsche Bank shares have been rebounding.</p><p>Mr. Zames, 50 years old, had developed a reputation as a fix-it man for banks. He had helped steer JPMorgan through the $6 billion \"London whale\" trading fiasco.</p>",
