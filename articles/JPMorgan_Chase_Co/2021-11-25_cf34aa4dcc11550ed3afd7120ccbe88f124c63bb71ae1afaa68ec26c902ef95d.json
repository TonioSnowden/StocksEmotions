  "text": "<p>Cause for celebration at Mitchells &amp; Butlers, the group behind pubs, bars and restaurants including Browns, All Bar One and Toby Carvery. </p> <p>It said this morning that it had returned to profitability and cash generation in the period since Covid restrictions were lifted. It reported a full-year operating profit of £81m — though it still made a pre-tax loss of £42m. Roughly 80 per cent of sales came in the six months to September, showing the extent of the bounceback. </p> <p>A “challenging” trading environment and “cost headwinds” continued to put pressure on the sector, M&amp;B said. But boss Phil Urban struck an optimistic tone thanks to the strength of consumer demand. </p> <p>Are hospitality businesses being too optimistic about the winter ahead? Or are they justified in thinking the outlook has brightened? Tell me what you think at&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a>.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Vitol</strong>, the world's largest independent oil trader, has struck a deal to take Africa-focused petrol station group Vivo Energy private again in a deal which values <strong>Vivo's</strong> equity at £1.8bn, a 25 per cent premium to last night's closing share price. Vitol owned 55 per cent of Vivo before it floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2018 and now holds a 36 per cent stake, with Helios Investment Partners holding 27 per cent. Helios is voting in favour of the takeover. </p> <p>The <strong>Financial Reporting Council</strong> said companies have more to do on disclosure around board appointments, succession planning and diversity, in its annual review of reporting against the <strong>UK Corporate Governance Code</strong>. It also said a greater focus on reporting the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems could improve confidence.</p> <p>A UK-headquartered medical cannabis company has announced its intention to float on Aim. <strong>Equinox International Holdings</strong> said it was seeking to raise funds to build “a state of the art cultivation, extraction and production facility on a Home Office-approved 20-acre UK site”. </p> <p>And <strong>Hochschild Mining</strong> welcomed an announcement from the Peruvian government yesterday which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec08376e-7425-4e96-9b7e-ef0a4388e4cb\">backtracked on unilateral mine closures</a>. Shares in the London listed company rebounded in Wednesday trading after shedding 25 per cent of their value on Monday.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Deutsche Bahn</strong> whistleblowers alleged fraud at Germany's biggest infrastructure project, Olaf Storbeck reports from Stuttgart. One of the employees was fired during an internal investigation that cleared managers of wrongdoing; the other cut off contact with compliance staff fearing retaliation. The employees alleged that some senior staff at the state-owned railway misused corporate funds as part of a widespread fraud. Deutsche Bahn says it has investigated the complaints but did not find anything untoward. The full story from Olaf is well worth a read: you can find it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7373c137-80ce-4a23-8257-9be3e8af0297\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ee3fad6-957d-4410-b5a7-9421ea131e51\">apologised (twice)</a> to <strong>China</strong> after telling a group of US business leaders that the bank he runs, <strong>JPMorgan</strong>, would outlast the <strong>Chinese Communist party</strong>. Joking about the centenary of both the party and the bank, Dimon said “I'll make a bet that we last longer,” adding: “I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway.” In one of his apologies, he clarified that he was “trying to emphasise the strength and longevity of our company”. Oops.</p> <p>And for something completely different: read how <strong>crypto miners</strong> in <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> (not something I was aware of, certainly) face a bitter winter of power cuts. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/086b7ec7-f71a-4214-bfa0-5644852056f3\">Martha Muir reports</a> how illegal miners and mass relocations after a ban on crypto mining in China have overloaded the energy grid. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4dd3acdc-6507-4dc0-a831-feb8d3cb3e3f\">My column this week</a> is on how businesses struggle with the art of raising prices.</p> <p>If you do want something different, though, try <strong>Claer Barrett</strong> on how the lights going out at <strong>Bulb</strong> signal a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26333fa0-c4bb-462e-9a70-6d5e35320b46\">worrying new stage</a> in the energy crisis.</p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Pub group Mitchells &amp; Butlers recovers as customers return' FT.com 25 November.
