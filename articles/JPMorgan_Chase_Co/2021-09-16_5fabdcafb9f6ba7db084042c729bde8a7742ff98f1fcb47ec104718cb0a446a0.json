  "title": "U.S. Retail Sales Likely Took a Hit From Delta Variant; Product shortages appear to have damped sales on items such as autos, restraining economic recovery. Retail could recover quickly once Covid-19 surge eases, economists say.",
  "text": "<p>The report will offer clues about how Delta, a highly contagious strain of the Covid-19 virus, has affected the recovery. Retail sales—including spending on restaurant meals, cars, cellphones and computers—are a big slice of consumer spending, which itself is the largest source of economic demand in the U.S.</p><p>Economists believe that industries relying on human contact, particularly restaurants, have suffered as some consumers retreat to their homes to avoid contracting the Delta variant. Private-sector data, such as restaurant bookings tracked by the website OpenTable, show that sales dipped last month after a rise in Covid infections and new orders by governors and mayors for customers to wear masks indoors.</p><p>\"It was just this really cruel moment for us, where there was this industrywide hope and public perception that restrictions were lifting and life was resuming normal,\" said Bill Jensen, a co-owner of Reveler's Hour, a pasta-and-wine bar in Washington, D.C. \"Those were dashed.\"</p><p>The restaurant first opened on the final evening of 2019 and was booked for the next three months. Then, after the pandemic hit the U.S., it temporarily closed. Business picked up quickly earlier this summer as more customers became vaccinated and the city lifted rules that had limited the number of customers indoors and required masks. In August, after the city imposed a new mask mandate and news of the Delta variant spread, business fell sharply again, and sales are roughly a third or less of their pre-pandemic level, Mr. Jensen said.</p><p>Thursday's report will also likely show the effect of ongoing shipping problems and shortages that have prevented merchants from meeting customer demand. Few industries have been as affected as car dealers, whose inventories are running thin because of a global computer-chip shortage.</p><p>Retail sales—reflecting how much Americans spent at merchants such as restaurants, grocery stores and hardware stores—are estimated to have dropped 0.8% last month, mostly owing to a steep drop in car sales, according to the Journal poll. Excluding autos, sales likely rose 0.1%.</p><p>Overall sales fell 1.1% in July from June, Commerce Department figures show, but were still up sharply from a year earlier.</p><p>Problems associated with the Delta variant have led economists in recent days to downgrade estimates for economic growth in the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday projected gross domestic product to expand at a 5% annual rate in July through September, down from a prior estimate of 7%, citing lower demand and production shortages, particularly in the car industry. </p><p>Few industries have been as affected as car dealers, whose inventories are running thin because of a global computer-chip shortage.

Economists believe retail sales could recover quickly as more Americans become vaccinated and feel safe again to venture out, and as product shortages ease.</p><p>\"I think consumer spending is taking a significant hit in August and probably September, but I don't think there's going to be lasting damage,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, a bond trading firm. \"I think the fundamentals are still as they were before.\"</p><p>Those fundamentals include a historically high level of savings, strong job growth and rising wages. \"Households have plenty of income to spend,\" Mr. Stanley said.</p><p>Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Retail Sales Likely Took a Hit From Delta Variant</p>",
