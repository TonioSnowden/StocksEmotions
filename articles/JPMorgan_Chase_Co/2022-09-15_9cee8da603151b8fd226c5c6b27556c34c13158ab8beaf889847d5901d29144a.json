  "title": "For Alzheimer's Trials, There's Little to Lose",
  "text": "<p>Since 1995, more than $42.5 billion went into enrolling thousands of patients across more than 1,000 trials. Yet to this day, not a single treatment is available to cure or slow disease progression.</p><p>Four drugs treat the disease's symptoms and Biogen's Aduhelm was approved last year in a controversial Food and Drug Administration decision, though its coverage was later restricted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, making the drug effectively inaccessible to the millions of patients.</p><p>One very frustrating aspect of the colossal failure that has been the quest for an effective Alzheimer's treatment is that the \"amyloid hypothesis\" -- the idea that targeting a buildup of the protein in patients' brains should slow dementia -- continues to let investors and patients down. Dozens of amyloid-targeting drugs failed in clinical trials.</p><p>Over the next year, drug companies have three more solid shots on goal using amyloid-targeting drugs. Optimism is understandably restrained. \"These studies will either help save this class of treatments or put the final nail in the coffin on this whole hypothesis,\" said Yatin Suneja, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities.</p><p>The first study to read out will be for Biogen and Eisai's lecanemab, which could come as soon as this month. Results for trials of Roche's gantenerumab and Eli Lilly's donanemab are expected within the next 12 months.</p><p>Each of the coming studies has incorporated lessons from past failures, so there is room for some hope. Among the positive things going for these studies is they have \"enrolled patients with clear amyloid disease, have optimized antibody dosing, picked the most sensitive endpoints and can detect even modest changes in the rate of cognitive decline,\" according to Morgan Stanley analysts.</p><p>Biogen has the most riding on these results. Its shares are down 31% over the past 12 months. The company has slashed costs and it is currently rudderless. Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos left in the wake of the unsuccessful commercialization of Aduhelm. If lecanemab falls short, whoever replaces Mr. Vounatsos will be under pressure to cut costs further. Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison suggests Biogen might need to make fewer attempts to \"swing for the fences\" and focus on getting a few \"low risk singles\" by looking for genetically defined neurological indications. If the study does produce excellent data -- an outcome many analysts view as having less than a 40% chance -- the stock would likely jump at least 30% to account for the multibillion-dollar opportunity that is Alzheimer's.</p><p>For Lilly and Roche, a failure wouldn't be as meaningful for the shares because those companies have broader drivers of growth. JP Morgan's Chris Schott says Lilly's donanemab is the front-runner in the race given its favorable study design and its record in previous trials. Because Lilly has other promising drugs in its pipeline, such as obesity treatment tirzepatide, the downside to the stock from a failure might not be very significant.</p><p>However disappointing it would be if all three trials fail to deliver tangible cognitive benefits, Alzheimer's patients have reason for continued hope. It could take years for meaningful progress, but there are many studies looking at different pathways of the disease.</p><p>For now, though, all eyes are on the drug industry's last-ditch effort to prove the amyloid hypothesis correct.</p>",
