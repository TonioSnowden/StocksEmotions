  "title": "'Teacher, Preacher, Soldier, Spy' Review: Paragon of the Strenuous Life; John R. Kelso was the ﬁrst man in his Missouri county to join the Union army. His fearlessness would win him the nickname 'the Hero of the South West.'",
  "text": "<p>Born in 1831, Kelso grew up in backwoods Ohio and Missouri. He was humiliated by his family's poverty, and from an early age believed he was destined for something greater than hardscrabble farming. Though he had virtually no formal schooling, he nurtured his ambition by devouring the few books he could find. By the time he was a teenager, he was master of the local school and a preacher in the Methodist church. At 18, after quarreling with his father, he left home and supported himself as a quarryman, river boatman and itinerant schoolteacher. Before age 30, he had broken with the church, earned a college degree, married, divorced, remarried, fathered four children and opened a private academy in Buffalo, Mo., in the southwestern corner of the state.</p><p>When the Civil War began in April 1861, Kelso was the first man in his county to enlist on the Union side. As a border state, Missouri was divided in its loyalties, and the war there was a vicious guerrilla struggle pitting neighbor against neighbor. In the first year of the war, Confederate sympathizers burned Kelso's house and drove off his family. \"From this time forward,\" he wrote, \"a new, less noble, but no less powerful motive would be added to my motives of patriotism. . . . This new motive was revenge, an intense desire for blood, which . . . became at last with me an all-absorbing passion which nothing but the blood of my enemies could ever appease.\"</p><p>Kelso threw himself into combat with hyperactive fury, leading daring raids against rebel positions and conducting hazardous spy missions deep in enemy territory. Drawing on Kelso's extensive memoirs, Mr. Grasso devotes nearly half of \"Teacher, Preacher, Soldier, Spy\" to these wartime exploits, which he recounts in vivid detail. Over one frenetic span, Kelso went four days without rest, until he fell asleep walking. Once he escaped Confederate captors even as they were building a makeshift gallows to hang him. During a firefight, he received a shotgun blast, suffering wounds that would plague him for the rest of his life. In a poignant episode, he happened upon the skeleton of a Union soldier propped against a tree, still clutching the faded photograph of a beautiful young woman. Once, after he became separated from his unit and his name was posted among the dead, he arrived home to find his own funeral in progress.</p><p>Promoted to lieutenant and later to captain, Kelso was celebrated by Unionists throughout Missouri as \"the Hero of the South West.\" \"No other Union officer [in the region] was ever so loved, so praised, so idolized by the Union people,\" he boasted, \"or so hated, so feared, so bitterly cursed by the rebels.\" Both sides were astonished by his fearlessness, which was rooted in the conviction that he was destined for further greatness after the end of hostilities.</p><p>Between military operations, Kelso mounted a political campaign, and in 1864 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he supported Radical Republican policies such as disenfranchisement for the rebels, political equality for freedmen and the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. He brought to Congress the same manic zeal he had shown during the war, but when his health suffered from overwork, he declined to run for re-election. Kelso's dreams of future greatness would not be realized in politics.</p><p>The rest of his life was a letdown. He opened a private academy that failed. He ran again for Congress but placed a distant third. He bought a farm that floundered. Distraught after losing two young sons within a month—a 5-year-old to tetanus and a 14-year-old to suicide—he left his wife and surviving children and headed for California. Divorcing, then marrying for a third time, he eventually settled in Colorado.</p><p>Whatever remained of Kelso's early religious devotion had not survived the war, and for the rest of his life the former Methodist preacher searched for something to take its place. Though he gave lectures and wrote books on subjects including spiritualism, atheism, anarchism and free love, his work never found a wide audience. By the time he died, on Jan. 26, 1891, \"the Hero of the South West\" had been forgotten.</p><p>There's no question that Mr. Grasso has written the definitive biography of John Russell Kelso. But what are we to make of this unfulfilled life? Mr. Grasso, a professor of history at William and Mary, admits that his subject was not a \"Great Man\" in the traditional sense, since \"he never achieved greatness by his exemplary accomplishments or his historical influence.\" To broaden Kelso's story, the author takes every opportunity to look beyond the man, with cogent discussions of national political and cultural trends and enlightening digressions on everything from phrenology to dueling. He concludes that Kelso was \"a representative man of nineteenth century America,\" personifying \"modes of character\" such as the Evangelical Christian, Enlightened Critic, Sentimental Hero and Radical Reformer.</p><p>But this claim seems unnecessary. Yes, Kelso's life reflected and illuminated the tumultuous times in which he lived, but most readers will be drawn to his story not for the archetypes he embodied, but for his amazing wartime exploits and for his striving, searching, far-from-perfect humanity. And that, it seems, should be enough for any life.</p><p>Mr. Helferich's most recent book is \"An Unlikely Trust: Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan, and the Improbable Partnership That Remade American Business.\"</p><p>'Teacher, Preacher, Soldier, Spy' Review: Paragon of the Strenuous Life</p>",
