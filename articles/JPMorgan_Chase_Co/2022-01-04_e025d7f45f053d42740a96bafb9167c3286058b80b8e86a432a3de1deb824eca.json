  "text": "<p>Opec and its allies agreed on Tuesday to boost oil output for the seventh consecutive month as oil prices climbed back above $80 a barrel, with the Omicron coronavirus variant increasingly seen as unlikely to substantially hit demand.</p> <p>The Opec+ group, which has included Russia since 2016, said it would increase production by another 400,000 barrels a day in February, continuing with the monthly plan agreed in July to gradually replace output cut at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Large oil consumers including the US, India and Japan regularly called on Opec+ last year to increase production at a more rapid rate, fearful that energy cost inflation could derail their economic recovery. But Saudi Arabia and other large members of the group have consistently stuck with the plan of more gradual output rises.</p> <p>“[Opec] has stayed steady with their policy despite all this uncertainty,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p>Croft added that, despite soaring coronavirus infections globally, the spread of Omicron appeared to have had less effect on oil consumption than feared. “Governments have shown that they are really reluctant to bring back deeply unpopular mobility restrictions, so the demand impact has been fairly contained.” </p> <p>Crude prices recovered strongly in 2021 as the global economy bounced back from the depths of lockdowns designed to control the pandemic, but had fallen back at the end of the year as the Omicron wave took off. The US also co-ordinated a move by consumer countries to release crude from strategic reserves to try to cool price inflation.</p> <p>But since falling from $85 a barrel in October to $65 in early December, Brent crude has started to climb again. Brent rose 1 per cent on Tuesday to move back above $80 for the first time in a month, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate climbed 0.5 per cent to $76.44.</p> <p>Christyan Malek, at JPMorgan, said that Opec and its allies were probably less concerned about Omicron than they were a month ago, but that the group might struggle to maintain the rate of production increases later this year, with some members finding it difficult to boost production.</p> <p>“These Opec monthly&#xa0;increments will eventually naturalise into lower monthly&#xa0;increments as they cannot maintain the 400,000 indefinitely due to shrinking spare capacity,” Malek said. </p> <p>“They are still very nervous about the need to encourage investment and that leans towards higher rather than lower prices.”<br><br>Beyond the lingering uncertainty of coronavirus, continuing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a5a7ed5-6476-4d92-bc4b-75f9e58e107c\">nuclear talks with Iran</a> and the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine represented further “wild cards” for Opec+ to manage, said RBC's Croft. “These are the negotiations that really matter near-term for oil,” she said.</p> <p>Croft added that the possibility that dialogue would fail to avert a renewed conflict in eastern Ukraine, resulting in further disruption to European energy markets, was another reason US officials continued to pressure Opec+ to keep increasing production.</p> <p>Amrita Sen, at Energy Aspects, a consultancy, also warned that oil demand could rebound quicker than expected in 2022 if the Omicron wave marked a shift in the response to the pandemic.</p> <p>“If the high level of infection does not translate into substantially higher hospitalisations and deaths, as some of the early data suggests, we could get a pretty big boost to demand if more restrictions are lifted and people are less afraid to travel for work or to fly off on holiday,” Sen said. </p> <p>“If that happens, forecasts for oil demand growth may need to be revised higher.”</p><p>Source: Tom Wilson and David Sheppard in London 2022 'Opec and allies agree to boost oil output as Omicron concerns ebb' FT.com 4 January.
