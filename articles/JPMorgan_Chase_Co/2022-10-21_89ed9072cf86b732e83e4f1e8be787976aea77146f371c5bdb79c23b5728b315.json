  "title": "Stocks Close Higher to Finish Strong Week; Yields pause their climb as investors weigh possibility of smaller rate increases",
  "text": "<p>All three major indexes ended with weekly gains of at least 4.7%, a reprieve after a prolonged period of volatility that has been marked by big swings for stocks and bonds around the globe. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 finished their best weeks since June, while the Nasdaq closed with its best week since July.</p><p>Major indexes turned higher and Treasury yields paused their climb as The Wall Street Journal reported that Federal Reserve officials are set to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point at their Nov. 1-2 meeting but are poised to debate shifting to a smaller increase in December.</p><p>Worries about the pace of interest-rate increases—and whether they will help drive the U.S. into a recession—have driven a sharp selloff throughout the year.</p><p>\"I think we're in the final innings of peak Fed hawkishness,\" said Christian Hoffmann, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management overseeing bonds.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped Friday but climbed for a 12th consecutive week, notching its largest gains over such a stretch since 1987. The yield on the benchmark note ended the week at 4.212%, near its highest levels of the past decade.</p><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is typically more sensitive to interest-rate expectations, also slipped Friday, ending the week at 4.489%.</p><p>Investors have been closely watching earnings for clues on how rising rates, a strong dollar and high inflation are affecting company profits. Results for the third quarter have thus far been a mixed bag. U.S. banks helped boost markets earlier this week with better-than-expected results, but cracks are showing elsewhere. So far, the net profit margin of S&amp;P 500 companies in the third quarter is set to decrease for the fifth consecutive period.</p><p>Snap shares tumbled $3.03, or 28%, to $7.76, after the company reported a further slowdown in sales growth and signaled the digital-ad market could remain lackluster for some time.</p><p>\"The reality is that we see weak growth, higher inflation, and earnings surprising to the downside. It's a pretty difficult combination,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \"This earnings season is going to still be OK. The worry is for the next two, in a way.\"</p><p>Twitter shares slid $2.55, or 4.9%, to $49.89,after Bloomberg News reported that Biden administration officials are discussing whether the U.S. should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national-security reviews.</p><p>Still, the week has been dotted by several signs that the U.S. economy is stronger than many initially feared. Several corporate leaders—from those at JPMorgan Chase to Delta Air Lines—have expressed confidence that the consumer remains strong. And fresh data on Thursday showed that the jobs market is still healthy.</p><p>In the U.K., markets came under pressure Friday as investors wondered who will win the race to become the country's next prime minister after the resignation of Liz Truss on Thursday.</p><p>Her election and resignation have driven sharp swings in the country's currency and bonds. The U.K. 10-year gilt yield rose to about 4.05% from 3.860% Thursday. Bond yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index rose 0.4%. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.6%</p><p>In commodity markets, oil prices edged up. Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained $1.12, or 1.2% a barrel, to settle at $93.50.</p><p>Asian stocks were mixed. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.4% and Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com and Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Higher to Finish Strong Week</p>",
