  "text": "<p>The Goldman Sachs executive who spearheaded its push into consumer banking is leaving, 10 months after he handed over day-to-day running of the business.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5365e1a-d79d-4da8-81b6-d1c2786a3860\">Harit Talwar</a> will exit Goldman in October. The departure crystallises a transition to a new phase of leadership at its consumer business, one of the Wall Street investment bank's biggest initiatives in decades. </p> <p>Talwar, the former US cards boss at Discover, joined Goldman in 2015 as the first employee of what would become Marcus, its new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8678e6ab-b773-303c-83f1-949d8b1d8817\">consumer lending </a>business. The goal was to find new sources of revenue by banking retail depositors and borrowers, diversifying from Goldman's traditional client base of big institutions and rich individuals. </p> <p>“We set out to build a fintech inside a 150-year-old investment bank. There were many sceptics, some frankly inside the firm and many more outside, about whether this could be done,” Talwar told the Financial Times. </p> <p>Talwar led the launch of Marcus, named after the bank's founder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f96eeb68-65dc-11e6-8310-ecf0bddad227\">Marcus Goldman</a>. Goldman has also partnered with other companies such as Apple to push financial products, including credit cards.</p> <p>Marcus now has more than 2,000 staff, 8m customers, $100bn in deposits and almost $10bn in loans and card balances. </p> <p>A report this month by Autonomous Research pegged the value of Goldman's Marcus business at between $7bn and $11bn. Goldman's total market capitalisation is about $130bn. </p> <p>Autonomous estimated that Marcus is the second-largest “neobank”, a digital banking services provider, by revenue behind Square's Cash App.</p> <p>JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank with a vast network of bricks-and-mortar branches, had just over $1tn in deposits within its consumer and community banking unit at the end of the second quarter. </p> <p>“If you look at what we've accomplished the last five years, whether at the size of deposits, the range of products, the range of partnerships, it is unprecedented. It is, in our minds, one of the best fintech stories in the industry,” Talwar said. </p> <p>Goldman's consumer business has encountered change at the top. Talwar at the start of 2021 handed over day-to-day management to his longtime deputy, Omer Ismail, who soon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/118b29ba-f118-46ff-b639-675ceb3c1cf6\">departed</a> Goldman for Walmart. Talwar had stayed on at Goldman as chair of the consumer division and a partner at the bank. </p> <p>The consumer business is now run by Peeyush Nahar, who joined Goldman earlier this year having previously worked at Uber and Amazon. </p> <p>In a sign of Goldman's ambitions to further grow its consumer business, the bank last week announced a $2.2bn deal to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9897043-cde9-491a-8417-831bf3b89002\">buy</a> online loans provider GreenSky. </p> <p>“We have savings, lending, investing, and we're close to launching checking. We're getting to the moment where we can help someone holistically manage their financial lives,” Stephanie Cohen, Goldman's global co-head of consumer and wealth management, told the Financial Times. </p> <p>Talwar is the latest senior executive to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c83b53a-4427-4415-877b-f534ea3b379a\">leave</a> Goldman, with Stephen Scherr, the bank's chief financial officer, saying last week he would leave after 28 years. </p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Goldman Sachs executive who led consumer banking launch set to depart' FT.com 23 September.
