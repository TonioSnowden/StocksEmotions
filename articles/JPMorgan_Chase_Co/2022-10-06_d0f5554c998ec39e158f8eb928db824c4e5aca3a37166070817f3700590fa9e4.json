  "title": "Business News: Credit Suisse Faced Online Attack",
  "text": "<p>But while the meme-stock crowd has rallied to support ailing retailers and cinema chains, it remains suspicious of traditional finance. Much of the commentary around Credit Suisse was far more negative, poking fun at a bank some dubbed \"Debit Suisse.\"</p><p>Rumors about the financial health of Credit Suisse began flying late last week with social-media chatter about the company's tumbling share price. The company's chief executive urged employees in a memo that leaked late Friday not to confuse stock performance with capital strength and liquidity.</p><p>The bank has weathered a series of scandals and executive turnover in recent years, and the memo did little to assuage investors or armchair experts. A now-deleted tweet by a journalist in Australia claiming a major international investment bank was \"on the brink\" helped fuel speculation.</p><p>On Reddit, individual investors piled on, with some suggesting Credit Suisse could be the next Lehman Brothers, the U.S. investment bank that collapsed in 2008. Credit Suisse began to trend on Twitter. \"How the mighty have fallen,\" posted CNBC's Jim Cramer.</p><p>When markets opened Monday, the fallout was swift. The bank's shares plunged 12% in Zurich, touching a record intraday low, before recouping most of their losses in high trading volumes. The value of the bank's riskiest bonds dropped sharply, and the cost of insuring Credit Suisse's debt against default surged.</p><p>Jim Lewis, the co-founder of Wall Street Silver, a popular Twitter account and Reddit forum, said concern over the Federal Reserve might also have fueled anxiety. The central bank is lifting interest rates and paring its bondholdings, in a process known as quantitative tightening. \"When you have such a dramatic change in interest rates and quantitative tightening so quickly, someone has to be on the wrong side of this,\" Mr. Lewis said.</p><p>Still, the kerfuffle over Credit Suisse surprised some market watchers. Despite years of scandals, including a more-than-$5 billion hit last year from its dealings with its client, Archegos Capital Management, there were no obvious triggers for the sudden turmoil.Credit Suisse plans to provide a strategy update on Oct. 27.</p><p>The bank spent the weekend communicating with clients and investors, people familiar with the matter said, emphasizing the bank's nearly $100 billion capital buffer. Some employees monitored social-media posts across Twitter and Reddit, one of the people said.</p><p>The surge of posts on sites such as Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, a popular individual-investor hangout, marked a new frontier for the financial institution. Large banks typically haven't historically needed to spend much time scouring Reddit.</p><p>Wall Street analysts rushed to the bank's defense. JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note that they saw Credit Suisse's \"capital and liquidity position as healthy.\" At Citigroup, analysts said: \"This is not 2008.\"</p><p>By Tuesday, some of the nerves had subsided. Credit Suisse's Swiss-traded shares rebounded nearly 9%.</p>",
