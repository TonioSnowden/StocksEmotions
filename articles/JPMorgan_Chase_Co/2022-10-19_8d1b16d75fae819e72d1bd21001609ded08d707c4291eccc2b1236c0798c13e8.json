  "text": "<p>Jeremy Hunt has established a new Economic Advisory Council in a little-noticed element of the new chancellor's fiscal plan that swept away most of the unfunded tax cuts from last month's “mini” Budget. </p> <p>Consisting of former officials who now work in finance, the council members were chosen for their expertise and knowledge of markets, according to allies of the chancellor. </p> <p>The idea for the group was hatched over the weekend and was the brainchild of Rupert Harrison, former chancellor George Osborne's chief economic adviser who now works as a portfolio manager at BlackRock. </p> <p>“Rupert Harrison in particular has enormous experience of running the Treasury under George Osborne over many years, and I think that he will make an important contribution, as will his colleagues on the council,” said Hunt when he announced the formation of the group.</p> <p>The other members are Sushil Wadhwani, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and founder of Wadhwani Asset Management, a hedge fund now owned by Prudential Financial Inc; Karen Ward, European economics lead at JPMorgan Asset Management and a former adviser to former chancellor Philip Hammond; and Gertjan Vlieghe, a former MPC member, who is now chief economist at Element Capital, the hedge fund. </p> <p>The Treasury said the number of members would be increased in due course. </p> <p>The announcement in parliament of their appointment was designed to make clear that ministers in the Treasury were no longer taking advice from economists that had supported Kwasi Kwarteng's “mini” Budget. </p> <p>These included Patrick Minford, Gerard Lyons and Julian Jessop, said a Treasury official, although he disputed the degree of influence these economists had over Kwarteng's economic policy. Lyons denies he advised on the “mini” Budget.</p> <p>The new council members' prominent roles in finance have however raised eyebrows with other market participants who privately voiced concerns about possible conflicts of interest. </p> <p>The Treasury responded that council meetings would be a “one-way conversation” without any testing of government policy. One of those selected said the appointments were subject to approval by the compliance departments of their current employers. </p> <p>According to the council's <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-advisory-council-terms-of-reference/economic-advisory-council-terms-of-reference-october-2022\">terms of reference</a> the positions are unpaid. Members will meet periodically at the chancellor's discretion and will hold no policymaking power. </p> <p>“Care will be taken to ensure council members will not be given access to or provided with material non-public information or anything which raises issues of anti-competitive behaviour or market abuse,” the terms of reference say. Members will be required to recuse themselves from meetings if they have a conflict of interest. </p> <p>Chancellors have for decades sought external advice in forums similar to the Economic Advisory Council, although the precise form has shifted a number of times. </p> <p>In the 1990s, Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke consulted the so-called Treasury wise men for advice and economic forecasting until the group was scrapped by Gordon Brown when he became chancellor in 1997. </p> <p>Brown and Osborne later used a “Council of Economic Advisers” as a way to employ advisers as a shadow Number 10 policy unit to prepare for becoming prime minister. </p> <p>Hunt's council will be modelled most closely on the arrangements employed by Hammond when he was chancellor, and ministers and the Treasury's chief economist convened meetings with external advisers. </p> <p>“In a period of global economic challenge and volatility, exacerbated by Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine, prioritising UK economic stability is vital and will underpin long-term growth,” said Hunt. </p> <p><em>This story has been amended to add that Gerard Lyons denies he advised on the “mini” Budget</em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/91b8a350-5817-4b40-a5ea-c62ec832aa9c.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a62d9e3f-edd8-4b50-ba74-250567d03669\"><em>An economist, outside the tent, looking in/ From Gerard Lyons, London W1, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Chris Giles in London  2022 'Jeremy Hunt reinforces return to ‘orthodoxy' with Economic Advisory Council' FT.com 19 October.
