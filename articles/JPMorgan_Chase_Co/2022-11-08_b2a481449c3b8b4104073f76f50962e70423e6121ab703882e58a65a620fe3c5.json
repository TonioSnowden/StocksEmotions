For <strong>Liverpool FC </strong>owner <strong>John Henry</strong>, the price was too tempting.</p> <p>Henry's <strong>Fenway Sports Group </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a131793d-028d-4aa8-9da3-acb50967ddfa\">exploring a sale</a> of the football club, 12 years after purchasing it for just £300mn.</p> <p>Henry became one of the most active dealmakers in sports long before owning teams became a hot Wall Street commodity. Along the way, he has shown a knack for knowing when to buy and, most importantly, sell.</p> <p>Henry made his first big purchase buying the ailing <strong>Florida Marlins </strong>in 1999 for $158mn, but quickly flipped the baseball team and pursued a far better deal — his 2001 purchase of the <strong>Boston Red Sox</strong> for $700mn.</p> <p>The Red Sox and Liverpool are the heart of a sports empire Henry has assembled from his winnings as a futures trader, running quantitative investment strategies for his eponymous <strong>John W. Henry &amp; Co</strong>, which closed in 2012. Effectively, the big numbers, finance guy went on to make a killing applying his maths genius to sports.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhTxMV2olP4\">You'll never monetise alone</a>, though. The Boston-based group is being advised by <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>and <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>after it was approached by at least one potential buyer.</p> <p>Henry appears to be walking away from football while he's still on top.</p> <p>The Chelsea sale attracted more than 200 bids and kicked off other major deals at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/146cc390-3060-45cd-a986-e09e7e6c67cb\"><strong>AC Milan</strong></a> and France's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60edd262-a16d-4036-b706-636ef6a312a1\"><strong>Olympique Lyonnais</strong></a>, illustrating demand from buyers. The insatiable appetite for football assets is not the only reason Henry's looking to part ways with the club, however. </p> <p>He has had not one, but two failed attempts to cash in on Liverpool's triumphant resurgence: once in 2020, in a secret plan to transform English football dubbed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22ffc8bb-81d8-4d8d-86f3-2b4c70b38ccb\">“Project Big Picture”</a> and during discussions around the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3ab9f68-65b2-4839-96b3-ec4d2928053b\"><strong>Super League</strong></a> the following year — both of which were criticised as power grabs by the top clubs.</p> <p>“I want to apologise to all the fans and supporters of Liverpool Football Club for the disruption I caused over the past 48 hours,” he said in a rare video appearance following the Super League's collapse.</p> <p>Liverpool's manager<strong> Jürgen Klopp</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/14/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-city-ffp\">caused a stir</a> earlier this month when he declared “there are three clubs in world football who can do what they want financially”, reportedly referring to Gulf-owned clubs such as <strong>Manchester City, Newcastle United </strong>and <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong>.</p> <p>But he was likely echoing concerns held by Henry and his fellow club owners in the west. Plans to revive the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28a6bb35-ac53-4365-abf2-7d6e1a57d3e9\">breakaway league</a> notwithstanding, fan opposition to a structural overhaul places a limit on their ability to turn clubs into moneymaking machines. </p> <p>European football's promotion and relegation process also makes the sport inherently risky for investors: the Premier League's highly competitive annual battle among clubs to qualify for European tournaments, for example, means that no side is guaranteed to remain at the top.</p> <p>Henry's purchase of a controlling stake in the <strong>Pittsburgh Penguins</strong> hockey team last year and interest in buying a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/11/24/red-sox-fenway-sports-owner-nba\">US basketball franchise</a> look like safer bets in comparison.</p> <p>The former hedge fund manager's interest in Liverpool has always been more financial than emotional. “I think he wants to make money,” as one person who knows him <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e60b408e-f325-4340-a342-6d5f0b11762b\">told the FT's Sara Germano</a> in 2020.</p> <h1>Elliott snus-es out a deal</h1> <p>Not bad for a few months of work. That's what traders at <strong>Paul Singer's Elliott Management </strong>will be thinking after securing about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a624ec6b-bc6a-4b51-9d09-e83a532c4ddf\">$150mn of profits</a> from building up a large stake in shares of <strong>Swedish Match</strong>.</p> <p>The smokeless tobacco group has been in the crosshairs of larger rival <strong>Philip Morris International</strong> for months. The Swedish company's signature snus, aka oral tobacco pouches, are the fastest-growing alternative nicotine category and key to PMI's pledge to “unsmoke the world”.</p> <p>But the presence of hedge funds led by Elliott threatened to undermine the plans of PMI's boss <strong>Jacek Olczak</strong>. After an initial deal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef5aa545-f017-4dc1-8955-76b6e1a5ee8b\">was agreed</a> at a price of SKr106 in May, fast money investors led by Elliott poured into Swedish Match's shares and created a headache for its would-be acquirers. </p> <p>Last month, Olczak responded by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5056409a-5746-41a8-ad21-ecdf2fb67643\">upping his offer to SKr116</a>. It was a generous near-10 per cent bump, covered in large part by the strength of the US dollar against the Swedish krona. But the deal's success came down to whether Elliott and the other funds would accept the offer or make mischief for months to come.</p> <p>Those fears were put to rest on Sunday when the FT revealed Elliott had agreed to tender its 10.5 per cent stake. PMI on Monday said it had shareholders acceptances of 83 per cent and was on its way to reaching the 90 per cent hurdle it needed to cross. </p> <p>Singer's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3bb0f96-1816-4481-8318-4f7583326a4a\">dismal outlook</a> on markets could be one reason that Elliott senior portfolio manager <strong>Nabeel Bhanji</strong>, who led its investment from the firm's London office, was keen to avoid a long fight with PMI. Either way, Elliott never had to say anything publicly to earn this big payday. </p> <p>It's also the latest sign that the ‘bumpitrage' strategy is alive and well in Europe. The next <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b53b758-02e0-42a9-8252-3f5ee9f129fe\">showdown</a> between investors pushing for more from a European corporate takeover: <strong>Schneider Electric</strong>'s deal for the UK's <strong>Aveva</strong>. </p> <h1>How Oaktree conquered Versailles</h1> <p>In early 2021, just months before a liquidity crisis at Chinese property developer<strong> Evergrande </strong>hit global stock markets, the company's chair launched an ambitious plan to turn a sprawling plot of farmland in north Hong Kong into an ultra-luxury project with his own 240,000 sq ft villa that would resemble the Palace of Versailles.</p> <p>To fund this dream, which it had nicknamed “Project Castle”, Evergrande quietly turned to Los Angeles-based distressed debt investor<strong> Oaktree Capital</strong>, which had been increasing its lending in Asia. Oaktree loaned Evergrande $720mn, which it secured against the land, meaning it could take control in the event Evergrande defaulted on its debt.</p> <p>Oaktree pulled that trigger barely a year later after Evergrande admitted it could not meet its financial obligations, which had accumulated into a $300bn mountain of debt. The firm appointed receivers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d82c807-ca1f-4101-b515-e0f53f9503ed\">seize the land from Evergrande</a> in January.</p> <p>The move made it harder to restructure Evergrande's other international debts — foreign investors had piled about $20bn into its bonds — and put Oaktree at the front of the queue to recoup its investment in the ailing Chinese property giant.</p> <p>Oaktree closed the circle this week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d52f90-9a13-4c1d-a7aa-c0ba3ba192c7\">selling the land to an as yet unidentified buyer.</a> On Monday, Evergrande revealed to the Hong Kong stock exchange that its losses on the project would be a colossal $770mn.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Oaktree recouped all of its original investment and made a profit of about $140mn, according to a person familiar with the matter, due to a 19 per cent interest rate on its loan.</p> <p>While the funds that bought up Evergrande's bonds as it spiralled towards bankruptcy look set to lose almost all of their investment, the Oaktree saga is a masterclass in debt investing.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Brian Gudofsky</strong>, <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s global head of technology investment banking, is joining <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> as head of technology, media and telecommunications investment banking.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> has promoted<strong> Erik Savola</strong> as Nordic cluster head, country head for Sweden, and co-head of Nordic banking, capital markets and advisory. The US bank has also promoted <strong>Nicholas Skjold Hendy</strong> as country head and head of corporate banking for Denmark.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>has hired<strong> Zheniya Sidarchuk</strong>, a banker at <strong>Silicon Valley Bank Securities</strong>, as a managing director, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-04/jpmorgan-hires-svb-securities-technology-m-a-banker-sidarchuk\">per Bloomberg</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>London-listed chemical manufacturer <strong>Croda</strong> has named former<strong> Meggitt</strong> chief financial officer<strong> Louisa Burdett</strong> as group finance director, succeeding <strong>Jez Maiden</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Highly caffeinated </strong>Howard Schultz is back for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33c71eb1-e396-477a-b156-f32fcfe17fbc\">a third shift as Starbucks' CEO</a>. The failed presidential candidate, whose chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri told the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson that she consumes about eight shots of espresso a day, will need to find a way to re-energise the business.</p> <p><strong>Game over </strong>HSBC's days as the banking embodiment of globalisation have ended. As geopolitical tensions intensify and a row with Ping An continues, the bank's next generation of leadership may need to accept that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80fd0450-9100-4c40-a579-1bdd4d2f1340\">its model is out of kilter</a> with a fracturing world, the FT's Patrick Jenkins writes.</p> <p><strong>Silver linings </strong>The dealmaking slump has forced banks to trim their ranks.
