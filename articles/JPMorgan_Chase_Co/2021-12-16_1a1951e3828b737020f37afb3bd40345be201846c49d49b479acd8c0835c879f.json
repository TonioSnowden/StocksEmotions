  "title": "How Banks Win When Interest Rates Rise; Banks are hungry for higher rates, which let them charge more on loans. But don't expect deposit rates to budge.",
  "text": "<p>For the nation's biggest banks, even a small increase in the Fed's benchmark rate could lead to billions of dollars in revenue, since the banks can charge more on loans but aren't likely to pay depositors more. Banks also are sitting on giant piles of cash that aren't earning returns, and some bankers have said they plan to redeploy that money into securities as soon as interest rates rise.</p><p>Bank investors are paying close attention. Trading windfalls that propelled banks through the early pandemic are expected to slow, and many are expecting higher expenses for technology and expansion plans.</p><p>\"The tiebreaker could be interest rates,\" said John McDonald, a banking analyst at Autonomous Research. \"Banks are as rate sensitive as they've ever been.\"</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. are loaded with U.S. deposits and are the most sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. Both calculate they could earn more than $7 billion in additional annual revenue if there were a 1 percentage point jump in both short- and long-term rates at the same time, according to their disclosures.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. would gain $6.7 billion in revenue. The bank brought in about $52 billion in net interest revenue in the past 12 months.</p><p>Wall Street's expected 2022 earnings per share for big banks would be on average 19% higher if they added the gains from that hypothetical rate move, Mr. McDonald said. For Wells Fargo, it would be a 38% boon.</p><p>Still, that scenario is unlikely. Most Fed officials still have interest rates topping out at 1% in 2022, not jumping that much overnight. And the scenarios assume banks and their clients keep all assets unchanged.</p><p>Banks make their core profits from collecting more interest from borrowers than they have to pay depositors. As the Fed raises interest rates, banks can start charging more for loans but are unlikely to face higher deposit costs immediately.</p><p>The Fed's last round of rate increases started in late 2015. Industrywide, net interest income grew 7% to 9% a year from 2016 to 2018, according to Barclays analysts. Banks generally didn't increase their payments to depositors much, confident they had strong enough relationships to keep customers from chasing a few dimes every month.</p><p>That is expected to play out again this cycle. The biggest banks are awash in deposits, even more so than they were a few years ago, so they can afford to be stingy.</p><p>\"When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes I think it's déjà vu all over again,\" Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in October. \"In 2015, 2016, 2017, it was all about the Fed's going to normalize rates and you're going to have to raise prices. And we didn't have to.\"</p><p>On the other hand, banks are able to raise interest rates on loans fairly quickly. Postcrisis regulations mean banks hold more short-term loans, which can quickly reprice to higher interest rates. For instance, banks no longer hold many 30-year mortgages. Instead, they have lots of auto and commercial loans, which tend to last only a few years.</p><p>Banks are also holding more cash at the Fed than normal. That kind of dry powder can quickly be moved into investments if interest rates rise, bankers have said. JPMorgan has said about $200 billion could be shifted in days; Bank of America has said it has about $350 billion to maneuver.</p><p>Analysts at Janney Montgomery Scott said banks could boost earnings per share by a median 9% by 2023 if they redeploy their extra cash into investments.</p><p>Still, increased rates don't automatically mean more profits. For example, higher rates can depress mortgage lending. Also significant is the Fed's take on the economy, not just what it does with rates.</p><p>\"The why is far more important than the number,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in April.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will you move your deposits if your bank doesn't raise rates?
