  "title": "Why We're Bullish on Energy Stocks; The ESG bubble has begun deflating, and high interest rates make technology companies less attractive.",
  "text": "<p>Some investments are suitable for the fearful, others for the greedy. U.S. energy stocks may be a rare fit for both. The sector is an inflation hedge and also has home-run growth potential if liberated from shareholder-imposed mandates to abide by environmental, social and governance constraints. Energy stocks should continue to outperform as capital rotates from technology to energy.</p><p>Record low interest rates from 2009 through 2021 led investors to embrace risk by valuing uncertain cash flows in the distant future relative to low-yielding cash in the bank. That fueled a 12-fold appreciation in U.S. technology stocks, as the sector's average price-earnings ratio rose to 34 from 13. (The S&amp;P 500 index increased fourfold and multiples expanded from 14 to 25.) Pandemic policies in 2020-21 supercharged this trend. Unprecedented fiscal stimulus left consumers and states flush with cash that fueled even greater risk-taking, while lockdowns and remote work favored tech.</p><p>U.S. energy stocks charted a different course. Low interest rates encouraged oil companies to overleverage and overinvest in low-returning projects. In late 2014, the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus boosted production, leading to a supply glut that caused oil prices to collapse by 70% and energy stocks to plummet.</p><p>Poor returns made it easy for dividend-hungry short-term investors to embrace ESG mandates for reduced fossil-fuel production and net-zero emissions targets. Long-term investors usually serve as a check against short-termism, but the ESG movement applied a veneer of prudence and moral virtue.</p><p>Thus over the same period that investors ascribed rich value to uncertain future profits in tech stocks, they abandoned their willingness to do so for energy stocks. As their cost of capital declined, tech companies were free to invest in valuable long-term projects if it meant trading off short-term profitability, while energy companies were under pressure to do the opposite. Merrill Lynch aptly declared energy \"arguably . . . the biggest loser of a rise in ESG investing.\"</p><p>Three things changed this year. Soaring inflation provided a tailwind for U.S. energy stocks that benefit from higher oil and gas prices. Rising interest rates reduced investors' risk appetite, which disfavored tech stocks. Most important, Russia's invasion of Ukraine exacerbated oil and gas shortages and highlighted the long-run risks of underinvestment in energy. These factors show that a global transition from fossil fuels won't happen on the time horizon implied by the prevailing ESG investment consensus.</p><p>U.S. energy is positioned for growth. It still trades at historically depressed valuations: Since June 2018, it has underperformed the market even as profits have overperformed. From June 2018 through June 2022, earnings per share for the energy sector rose 93%. Stock prices dipped 3%. In the tech sector, earnings rose only 73%, yet stock prices rose 82%. U.S. energy stocks would have to appreciate 3.5 times to achieve their historical relative value versus technology stocks since 1990. Add potential for increased earnings by meeting supply shortages, and the potential for P/E expansion as investors ascribe greater terminal value to fossil-fuel producers, and there is still ample room to run.</p><p>U.S. energy indexes have already caught the beginnings, appreciating 58% year to date, but stocks haven't yet priced in the potential scale of a looming supply-demand imbalance for oil and gas. Global demand has been artificially suppressed by China's zero-Covid policies and the Biden administration's tapping the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, now at its lowest inventory since 1984. The European Union's ban on Russian oil is due to take effect in December, creating the potential for a global supply shock. OPEC producers have already signaled they are producing oil at near-maximum capacity, presenting an opportunity for U.S. energy to fill the vacuum.</p><p>Some investors may be deterred by regulatory headwinds, but policy changes are quietly shifting in favor of the sector. In June the Supreme Court held in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in forcing coal and gas producers to subsidize renewables, a decision that could neuter broader regulations on oil and gas. The Biden administration appears to be loosening restrictions and softening its posture on drilling permits in response to political pressure.</p><p>A key obstacle: ESG-linked asset managers remain the largest shareholders of publicly traded U.S. energy companies. They have imposed scope 3 emissions caps (Chevron) and climate-change strategies (Exxon) that constrain U.S. energy companies from making necessary investments in fossil-fuel production. JP Morgan estimates by 2030 oil and gas companies will require an additional $1.2 trillion to $1.3 trillion in capital expenditures to meet demand. Chronic underinvestment in production now leaves the world at risk of sustained oil and gas shortages. In the name of minimizing negative externalities, these ESG investors have created externalities of their own by encouraging decarbonization in the absence of feasible alternatives.</p><p>If post-ESG investors deliver a different shareholder mandate—to invest in greater production and meet long-run demand—U.S. energy companies can outperform. Warren Buffett, who last year criticized BlackRock-backed ESG mandates at Berkshire Hathaway as \"asinine,\" has quietly amassed U.S. energy exposure, going from no reported publicly traded holdings at the start of this year to a 20.9% stake in at least one large publicly traded U.S. energy company as of late September. One of us (Mr. Sokol) served as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, with an equity value of approximately $90 billion today and widely regarded as one of Mr. Buffett's best acquisitions. The other founded a new asset manager that mandates energy companies to focus exclusively on long-run profitability over ESG factors.</p><p>If other market participants defect from the ESG-driven consensus, that will drive energy-sector outperformance. Trends already point in that direction: May 2022 marked the first month in three years that ESG funds saw their inflows decline. As Mr. Buffett wrote during the early stages of U.S. stock-price recovery after the 2008 crisis, \"if you wait for the robins, spring will be over.\"</p><p>As the season of the tech giants fades to winter, the resurgence of energy may bound into spring—especially if investors sow the seeds by delivering a new shareholder mandate to the sector. Four of the five largest companies in the world by market capitalization are U.S. tech companies (the fifth is an oil company, Saudi Aramco). Only one U.S. energy company, Exxon Mobil, cracks the top 10. As recently as 2013, Exxon was the largest company in the world. It could be again.</p><p>Mr. Ramaswamy is executive chairman of Strive Asset Management and author of \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam\" and \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.\" Mr. Sokol is chairman and CEO of Teton Capital and a co-author of \"America in Perspective: Defending the American Dream for the Next Generation.\"</p><p>Why We're Bullish on Energy Stocks</p>",
