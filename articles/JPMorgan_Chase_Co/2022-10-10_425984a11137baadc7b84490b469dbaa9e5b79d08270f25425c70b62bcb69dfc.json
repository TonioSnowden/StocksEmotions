  "title": "JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon warns US recession ‘likely' in six to nine months",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon predicted the American economy will tip into a recession next year, warning the downturn threatened to spark “panic” in credit markets and wipe an additional 20 per cent from the value of US stocks.</p> <p>The comments from Dimon, whose economic pronouncements are closely followed by investors, followed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/276c1364-c312-4ad8-8b76-31f4d25dfa5f\">similar remarks last month</a> by billionaire investor Ken Griffin and point to a growing consensus among senior figures on Wall Street about the likelihood of a US recession.</p> <p>In an interview with CNBC on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Jamie_Dimon\">Dimon</a> listed rising interest rates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine as factors stoking the risk of a downturn in 2023.</p> <p>“These are very, very serious things, which I think are likely to push the US and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the US in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,” Dimon said.</p> <p>Dimon said early signs of distress were evident in the financial system, pointing to the depressed market for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/ipos\">initial public offerings</a> and high-yield debt deals, and anticipated the pain would soon spread into other areas.</p> <p>“The likely place you're gonna see more of a crack and maybe a little bit more of a panic is in credit markets,” he added.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07108e32-aff1-4d8c-8950-7f7c4e5a5f28\">Dimon warned of an economic “hurricane”</a>, and on Monday he again encouraged investors to be “very, very cautious”. He added: “If you need money, go raise it.”</p> <p>Asked where he saw the trough for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 share index, which is down more than 20 per cent this year, Dimon said the decline may still “have a ways to go” and “could be another easy 20 per cent”.</p> <p>“I think the next 20 per cent will be much more painful than the first. Rates going up another 100 basis points are a lot more painful than the first 100 because people aren't used to it.”</p> <p>JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, will report earnings on Friday. Analysts expect JPMorgan and other big banks will collectively <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dded71a6-2637-45ec-b8b5-da0154455c8b\">set aside more than $4bn</a> to cover potential losses from bad loans, in a sign of growing pessimism about the US economy.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon warns US recession ‘likely' in six to nine months' FT.com 10 October.
