  "title": "Staying Domestic Is Working for U.S. Bank Investors; Big Wall Street banks have to worry about global market volatility, but regional banks can benefit from a pickup in rates and loan growth",
  "text": "<p>Given what's going on in the world right now, U.S. bank investors can be forgiven for sticking closer to familiar territory.</p><p>Overall, U.S. banks don't have a significant amount at risk directly in Russia, with by one measure roughly $15 billion worth of exposure to the country, according to Bank for International Settlements data. That is a relative drop in the bucket. But banks' direct claims aren't the end of the story and many bank stocks have tumbled with the broader market this year.</p><p>One possible worry was that interest rates could rise more slowly if the spillover from Russia's invasion of Ukraine impacted the U.S. economic outlook. For now, though, the Federal Reserve is sharply moving up its rate projections and penciling in several more increases. Bank stocks are typically closely linked to rates because their interest income is expected to rise as rates do.</p><p>Wall Street banks that earn lots of fees from clients can outperform if there is a question about a slower pace of rate increases. But disruptions in markets—particularly in commodities, where prices have gyrated—have themselves been a major part of the concern in recent weeks. Market gyrations and selloffs can depress banks' revenues from client trading or advising companies on mergers and capital raising. Analysts' estimates anticipate first-quarter year-over-year trading revenue declines of about 20% across the biggest Wall Street banks, according to data from Visible Alpha.</p><p>The upshot: So far this year, global Wall Street banks have been underperforming large U.S. banks overall. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are all down more than the KBW Nasdaq Bank index's 1.6% decline. The banks outperforming the index include Wells Fargo and big U.S. regional and superregional lenders. These banks have exposure to U.S. rates and loan growth but less so to fees from global markets.</p><p>And corporate lending actually might benefit from clients' exposures to rising commodity prices. Broadly, commercial-and-industrial loans at large U.S. banks grew at the fastest year-over-year pace since 2020 in the most recent weekly update of Federal Reserve data. The $22 billion week-over-week growth was the largest dollar uptick since March 2020.</p><p>Shares of banks including Citizens Financial Group, Comerica, Fifth Third, KeyCorp, Truist Financial, Wells, U.S. Bancorp and Zions are either up or have outperformed the bank index so far in 2022. Citizens noted earlier in March that some corporate clients were \"pre-positioning and ordering ahead, in terms of bulking up on supplies,\" helping the bank on the utilization of credit lines. Fifth Third recently observed that \"capital markets disruption,\" which can make it harder for companies to raise new debt from investors, could benefit utilization rates. Zions has also said it expected to see utilization of credit by upstream energy clients with oil and gas reserves to go up \"fairly robustly.\"</p><p>The biggest Wall Street banks of course are also commercial lenders. Notably, JPMorgan is part of agroup of banks that have worked with Chinese metals producer Tsingshan Holding Group to provide the company with credit to cover margin calls. But with those banks' more global banking and trading exposure, investors might for now stay more cautious given the unpredictability of geopolitics. Bank analysts at Berenberg Bank noted that trading banks will have to carefully manage their exposures, particularly in commodities, and volatile markets might also necessitate taking on more risk-weighted assets, impacting capital ratios.</p><p>With potential risks lurking in the pace of rate increases and the effects of inflation on corporate margins and the economy, investors should stay cautious. But there are scenarios in which banks can pick up some business and offer U.S. investors some of the comforts of home cooking.</p><p>Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com</p><p>Staying Domestic Is Working for U.S. Bank Investors</p>",
