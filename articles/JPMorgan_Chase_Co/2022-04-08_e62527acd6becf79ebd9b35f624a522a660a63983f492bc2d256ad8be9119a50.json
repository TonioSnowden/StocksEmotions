  "text": "<p>BlackRock will not go ahead with plans to switch a €1.4bn iShares corporate bond exchange traded fund to an environmental, social and governance index, after a shareholder meeting to approve the change failed to reach quorum.</p> <p>Last month the world's largest asset manager <a href=\"https://www.igniteseurope.com/c/3533384/451994?referrer_module=article\">proposed</a> changing the index for its €1.4bn iShares € Corp Bond ex-Financials Ucits ETF to the Bloomberg MSCI Euro Corporate ex Financials Sustainable SRI index.</p> <p>The Dublin-domiciled ETF, which launched in 2009, currently tracks the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Corporate ex-Financials Bond index.</p> <p>BlackRock said at the time that the proposal came in response to “increased investor demand for evolving the existing sub-fund to adopt ESG characteristics while maintaining its broad market exposure”.</p> <p>However, the asset manager has since announced that the extraordinary general meeting held on April 1 to approve the changes “failed to pass as a quorum was not able to be met”.</p> <p>“The EGM was in relation to a proposed change to the benchmark index of the fund and therefore the investment objective and policy of the fund. The fund will therefore not undergo these proposed changes,” BlackRock said.</p> <p>The US group added that it would “take action in order to seek to understand the reasons behind the result of the EGM”.</p> <p><em>*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.
