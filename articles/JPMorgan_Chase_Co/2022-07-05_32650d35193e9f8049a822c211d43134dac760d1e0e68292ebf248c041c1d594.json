  "text": "<p>\"We are firmly in the midst of the economic slowdown we expected,\" wrote strategists at Morgan Stanley led by Michael Wilson, chief investment officer, in a client note. \"Furthermore, due to the war in Ukraine and China's extended zero covid policy, this slowdown is even worse than we expected.\"</p><p>\"We believe most investors are also now in our camp and trying to determine how much earnings need to fall,\" they wrote. \"…In short, stock prices should be determined more by earnings than the macro going forward.\"</p><p>Read More: Credit Suisse cuts S&amp;P 500 target again for 2022 as U.S. stocks sink</p><p>Earnings season gets under way next week as results roll in from PepsiCo Inc.

JPM and Morgan Stanley MS, with the pace then picking up.</p><p>\"Equity markets could hang around, and even rally in the absence of a confirmation of a recession,\" the strategists wrote. \"Conversely, in the absence of confirmation a recession will be avoided, it will also be difficult for equity markets to rally too far. As we have discussed, earnings are too high even in the soft landing outcome.\"</p><p>Under that scenario, Morgan Stanley expects the S&amp;P 500 SPX to reach a fair value target of approximately 3,400 to 3,500.
