  "text": "<p>\"This positive development isn't something the industry or investors were expecting and so we look at this policy news as [a] sizable positive for a sector that has been viewed as very tough to invest in by the buy-side,\" Greff wrote in a note to clients, for two key reasons:</p><p>* \"Miserable\" near-term operating environment in which recent gross gaming revenue run rates are only about 10% of pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>* The lack of anyone's ability to reasonably predict when travel mobility would start improving between mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.</p><p>Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. WYNN shot up 12.7% to pace the gainers in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, and Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s stock LVS surged 12.4% to place second in the benchmark index.</p><p>Elsewhere, Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Ltd. shares MLCO rocketed 28.2% to a five-month high and MGM Resorts International's shares MGM gained 0.8%.</p><p>Greff said that although the e-visa news is positive for all Macau-centric stocks, he likes Las Vegas Sands (LVS) the best, as he views it as a play, not just for the Macau recovery, but also for expected estimate increases for its Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore.</p><p>\"We'd expect incremental capital return as both of its markets experience a recovery (something that should distinguish LVS from the others),\" Greff wrote.</p><p>For the second quarter, LVS reported total Macau-based revenue of $374 million, or 35.8% of total revenue, while revenue from the Marina Bay Sands total $679 million. For Wynn, total Macau operations revenue was $117.2 million for the quarter, or 12.9% of total revenue, while MGM's China revenue of $143.0 million was 4.4% of total revenue.</p><p>\"Of course, there likely will be fits and starts with COVID outbreaks, but this news has to be a positive for a sector that has experienced massive multiyear underperformance where sentiment can be described as negative to apathetic,\" Greff wrote.</p><p>Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts stocks lead S&amp;P 500 winners after Macau's surprise new COVID-recovery plan</p>",
