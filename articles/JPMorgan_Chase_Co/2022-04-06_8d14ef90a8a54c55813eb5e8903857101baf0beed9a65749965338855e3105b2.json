  "title": "HSBC Lifts Stake in China Securities Venture to 90%; Bank buys a bigger holding in HSBC Qianhai Securities from its state-owned partner",
  "text": "<p>The London-based lender said Wednesday it had bought the 39% stake in HSBC Qianhai Securities Ltd. from its partner, state-owned Qianhai Financial Holdings Co. The latter has retained a 10% stake in the business. HSBC didn't say how much it paid.</p><p>HSBC has moved to sharpen its focus on Asia in recent years, saying in 2021 that it would pour $6 billion of investment into the region over five years. China is an integral part of that shift, including a plan to hire 3,000 onshore wealth planners.</p><p>Asia is already HSBC's main profit center, generating $12.2 billion of profit before tax last year, or nearly 65% of the bank's total. And Hong Kong and mainland China are two of its most lucrative markets, alongside the U.K., producing pretax profits of $5.9 billion and $3.3 billion respectively.</p><p>\"Our increasing stake in HSBC Qianhai Securities reflects our commitment in developing China's rapidly growing capital markets,\" said David Liao, co-chief executive of HSBC Asia-Pacific, in a statement.</p><p>An HSBC spokeswoman said the increased stake would give the bank more board seats and greater flexibility in managing the unit, and would help justify it making more investment in the business.</p><p>HSBC Qianhai Securities started operating in late 2017, and was the first majority foreign-owned securities joint venture in China. At the time, HSBC was able to take advantage of an economic-partnership deal between Hong Kong and mainland China to get ahead of international rivals in securing that approval.</p><p>Since then, Beijing has opened the doors more fully to foreign financial firms, including Wall Street banks and big U.S. money managers, thanks partly to a trade deal with Washington. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. were both cleared last year to take full control of Chinese securities units.</p><p>Western banks are jostling for bigger roles in what has become one of the world's largest financial markets. As of February, Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks were worth some $13.7 trillion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, while central-bank data shows that China's bond markets, broadly defined, were worth about $21.4 billion.</p><p>The most-recent annual report on HSBC Qianhai Securities' website showed the unit made a loss of 136 million yuan, equivalent to $21.4 million, in 2020, on operating income of 260 million yuan. It ended that year with 1.45 billion yuan in assets and 202 staff.</p><p>Clarence Leong contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Quentin Webb at quentin.webb@wsj.com</p><p>HSBC Lifts Stake in China Securities Venture to 90%</p>",
