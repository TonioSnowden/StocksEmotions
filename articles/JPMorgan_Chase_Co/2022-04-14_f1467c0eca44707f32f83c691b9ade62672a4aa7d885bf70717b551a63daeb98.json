  "text": "<p>Citigroup's profit nearly halved in the first quarter as the US bank warned of up to $3bn in potential losses linked to its Russian operations.</p> <p>Citi said on Thursday it had set aside $1.9bn to cover loan losses, including $1bn for its Russian exposure and $900mn to cushion the blow from deteriorating economic conditions driven by inflation and soaring energy prices.</p> <p>But shares rose 2 per cent to $51.10 during morning trading as the impact from the war was less than feared and sudden swings in currency and commodities fuelled by the conflict helped prop up trading revenue.</p> <p>“Obviously, the Russia-Ukraine war drove significant volatility in FX markets,” chief financial officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters, referring to foreign exchange markets. “We were able to take advantage of that and we were well-positioned to do so in commodities.”</p> <p>Total revenue fell 2 per cent to $19.2bn, but exceeded Wall Street forecasts by $1bn, as volatility in commodities prices buoyed Citi's capital markets division and partially offset the sharp decline in investment banking fees<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47c9ec9f-e86e-427e-8a50-34e4a6757852\"> across Wall Street.</a></p> <p>Fees from trading commodities more than doubled, Mason said, and overall trading fees fell by just 1.8 per cent compared with the 14 per cent plunge analysts were expecting.</p> <p>The bank's profits in the first three months of the year fell 46 per cent to $4.3bn, or $2.02 per share, reflecting higher credit costs due to rising default and falling revenues. However, the result still beat analyst estimates of $3bn, according to FactSet data.</p> <p>The fallout from the war is another challenge for chief executive Jane Fraser, who laid out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1d0f4ae-5ffe-4222-a14d-beeeaf141537\">her plan</a> to improve profitability at the straggling US lender days after the Russian invasion began. </p> <p>Citi has accelerated efforts to reduce its exposure to Russia, which stood at $9.8bn as of the end of last year and fell to $7.8bn in the most recent quarter. The bank put its consumer operations in Russia up for sale a year ago and decided last month to exit its commercial banking business in the country.</p> <p>The lender did not provide an update on the sale process for its consumer bank, which has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/894144b6-c785-4fd5-8a3b-76747bc534dc\">stuck in legal limbo</a>. Tough sanctions imposed by western governments after the February 24 invasion have made it unlikely that Citi can exit the business without further losses. </p> <p>The bank now expects total potential losses from its exposure to Russia could amount to $2.5bn to $3bn, down from previous estimates of about $4bn “as a result of proactive de-risking”. </p> <p>“This is a fluid situation, and the ability to exit those businesses is really going to hinge on how the environment plays out,” Mason said.</p> <p>French lender Société Générale said it would take a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21b64f70-e71e-47d7-bf24-ad90dfa6a854\"> €3.1bn</a> hit after agreeing to sell its Russian retail bank to an investment company founded by billionaire Vladimir Potanin earlier this week.</p> <p>Russian operations of other large US banks were mostly limited to investment banking and have so far been less costly to unwind. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2eb49e29-dbf8-4d5f-be40-94915ae5e6d0\">reported results</a> on Wednesday, earmarked about $300mn for potential losses on loans associated with Russian entities in its corporate banking and asset management divisions. </p><p>Source: Imani Moise in New York 2022 'Citi profits tumble as bank warns it could lose $3bn in Russia' FT.com 14 April.
