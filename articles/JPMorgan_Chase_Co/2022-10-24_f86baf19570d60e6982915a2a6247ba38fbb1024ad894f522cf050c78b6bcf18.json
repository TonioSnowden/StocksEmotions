  "text": "<p>   Mr. Mtangi's Irish-Italian American mother, Lauren Lackey, raised him and a younger sister in subsidized housing in East Providence, R.I. His mother had met his father, Stanlake Mtangi, a chemist who was born in Zimbabwe, at a Newport disco in the late 1970s, and Mr. Mtangi became closer to him as an adult. </p><p>   Mr. Mtangi went to Harvard University and was drawn to the high stakes of Wall Street. He traded derivatives for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America, and at Credit Suisse ran a group handling complex trades in company stocks and share indexes. </p><p>   He was athletic, running 5 miles through Manhattan or biking to visit his sister in Brooklyn. Humor and a cool demeanor powered Mr. Mtangi over social and racial divides, people close to him said. He played pickup basketball on city courts and was nodded in by doormen at exclusive clubs in the Meatpacking District. </p><p>   The trader's prowess showed in a roughly $100 million gain Mr. Mtangi and his team made for Bank of America from a brief volatility spike shortly before he left for Credit Suisse, according to former colleagues and a media report at the time. </p><p>   Impending fatherhood presented a new path. On his 40th birthday, his partner took a photo of him holding a cake, shirtless and tattooed, a view of Manhattan behind him. </p><p>   On his final week, Mr. Mtangi stuffed his computer in a bag at his apartment and told his partner he was going to the office. </p><p>   It was Tuesday, and he checked into a hotel down the street and stayed there overnight, texting his partner and other family the next morning to say that he was OK but needed some time alone. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Mr. Rainey, the alleged drug courier, appeared on hotel surveillance, stopping to check his phone. </p><p>   Mr. Mtangi was on a call that evening with his boss, Michael Ebert. He didn't make a follow-up call later that night. </p><p>   Mr. Mtangi's partner called his family the next morning, and separately, Mr. Ebert got in touch with his sister to say he was trying to reach him. The credit card charge at the hotel eventually tracked him down. </p><p>   Mr. Mtangi's sister and her partner rushed to the hotel, where he was dead. His son was born three weeks later. </p><p></p>",
