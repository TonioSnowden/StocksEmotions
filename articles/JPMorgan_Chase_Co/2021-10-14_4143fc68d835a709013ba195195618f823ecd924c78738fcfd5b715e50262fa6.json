  "text": "<p>Bank of America reported double-digit revenue growth on Thursday as big increases&#xa0;in interest income and fees helped it to outperform megabank peers.</p> <p>Though the largest US lenders have been able to report higher profits this year due to lower credit costs and strength in fee businesses such as trading and investment banking, almost all have struggled to increase the revenue they make from core lending because of low interest rates and a slowdown in borrowing.</p> <p>But BofA was able to increase net interest income by 10 per cent during the third quarter, despite a 3 per cent drop in average loan balances, as it was more aggressive than peers in redeploying cash into investments.</p> <p>Overall, the second-largest US lender reported that revenue surged 12 per cent year on year to $22.8bn, ahead of an estimate of $21.7bn, according to a FactSet poll of analysts. </p> <p>Wells Fargo and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe68be0f-6496-4437-b223-068dfc7179d3\">Citigroup</a>, which also released quarterly earnings on Thursday, reported declines in revenue of 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. JPMorgan Chase earlier <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5fa2ba2-1fdf-4a55-a500-fdb0e7cba8e6\">reported </a>that revenue rose more than 1 per cent.</p> <p>BofA's profit also easily topped Wall Street projections as the bank followed peers in releasing more than $1bn in reserves for potential bad loans as the economic outlook improved, and reporting strong performance in dealmaking and equities trading. </p> <p>Earnings leapt 58 per cent to $7.7bn, or 85 cents a share, topping analyst expectations of 71 cents a share. BofA's shares climbed 1.1 per cent on Thursday while JPMorgan and Citi were roughly unchanged. </p> <p>Government stimulus payments and quantitative easing programmes have caused deposits to pile up on bank balance sheets faster than they can lend them out. With the outlook for loan growth still uncertain, some banks have started using the cash to buy Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in search of yield.</p> <p>“Right now we have more liquidity sources — cash Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities — than we have loans,” Paul Donofrio, BofA chief financial officer, told reporters. “That's a phenomenal statistic.”</p> <p>By contrast, JPMorgan Chase has been sitting on cash waiting for the chance to invest at higher rates. Chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said that the bank was still “happy to be patient” as the bank on Tuesday reported a $256m loss on its investment portfolio.</p> <p>But with interest rates slowly inching higher and rivals posting gains on their investments, JPMorgan may change its approach.</p> <p>“It wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities” for the bank's cash, Barnum said. </p><p>Source: Imani Moise in New York 2021 'Bank of America registers double-digit revenue growth' FT.com 14 October.
