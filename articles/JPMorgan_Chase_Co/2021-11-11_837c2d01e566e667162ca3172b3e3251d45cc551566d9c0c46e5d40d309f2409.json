  "text": "<p>\"There is very strong demand out of Europe, particularly for the longer-dated tranche,\" said Alexander von-zur-Muehlen, chief executive for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>\"It is clear that as China's fixed-income markets, already the second largest in the world, continue opening up, European investor interest and allocation is growing,\" he said in emailed comments.</p><p>The appetite for Chinese sovereign debt denominated in euros is mirrored by rising international holdings of bonds that Beijing issues domestically in its own currency.</p><p>Yuan-denominated Chinese government bonds have been added to indexes compiled by FTSE Russell, Bloomberg LP and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and global investors have increased their holdings in recent years.</p><p>The debt offers a premium over even-more-negative benchmark European government debt, which helps to explain the investor interest.</p><p>Three-year German government notes yielded about minus 0.733% as of Wednesday, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>This is the third straight year that China has issued bonds in both dollars and euros in the fall.</p><p>Unlike in the two previous years, this time the sale of euro bonds is bigger than its dollar equivalent, Deutsche Bank noted.</p><p>Asian governments and companies have typically found it easier to raise money in the world's huge dollar-denominated bond markets than in euros.</p><p>China's $4 billion dollar-bond sale last month also drew strong demand from international investors, despite data showing the country's economic growth slowed to 4.9% year over year in the third quarter, down from 7.9% in the previous three months.</p><p>China hired 12 banks, including Chinese, U.S. and European institutions, last week to manage the euro bond sale.</p>",
