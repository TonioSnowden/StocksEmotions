  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley MS advanced 3.8% on Thursday, accelerating the stock's 1.8% gain in the previous day's trading after it beat Wall Street's earnings target.</p><p>Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said the firm added $1 trillion in client assets last year, including $438 billion in net new assets.</p><p>The bank ended the year with about $6.5 trillion in client assets including its $4.9 trillion in wealth management and $1.6 trillion in its asset-management unit, with that figure expected to grow to $10 trillion in the not-too-distant future, Gorman said.</p><p>Adding color to the firm's guidance, Gorman said he expects a “very healthy growth rate” of 5% to 7% in client assets, ahead of the past growth rate of 3% or 4%.</p><p>He estimated if the figure grows by 5% a year in net new money and enjoys market appreciation of 5% to 6%, the firm will reach $10 trillion within five years.</p><p>“If you compound…you get to really big numbers,” Gorman said. “We can see a path to $10 trillion here, and we want to call that because we believe that's going to happen.”</p><p>See also:Goldman Sachs profit drops below Wall Street expectations</p><p>Morgan Stanley also provided an outlook for roughly 20% return on average tangible common shareholder equity (ROTCE), in line with the 20.2% delivered in 2021, including 20.4% in the fourth quarter. Previously, the bank had said it expected ROTCE of 14% to 16% over the last couple of years.</p><p>“I don't think you're going to find another bank in the world that's putting out a 20%-plus ROTCE goal,” Gorman said.</p><p>One analyst asked if Morgan Stanley will ramp up its risk exposure to reach the 20% ROTCE target, but Gorman said no.</p><p>“This is not about growing the balance sheet and growing risk-weighted assets,” Gorman said. “This is about growing durable fee sources, durable revenues, and managing our expenses. I don't know if we're going to achieve it every single year, but we're certainly – it's certainly a goal and it's a goal for a reason. So, no, I don't think it involves taking extra risk.”</p><p>Read now:Wells Fargo outshines JPMorgan as big banks kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season</p><p>BMO Research analyst James Fotheringham said Thursday that Morgan Stanley's long-term financial targets were broadly in line with previous expectations.</p><p>He reiterated an outperform rating on Morgan Stanley and shaved his price target by $1 to $108 a share on higher expected costs.</p><p>“MS continues to exhibit strong fundamental momentum across its businesses (particularly in wealth management and investment management,” he said.</p><p>These two units will help Morgan Stanley shift to “more predictable and faster-growing business,” he said.</p><p>Fotheringham trimmed his forward earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley by as much as 3% due to higher costs.</p><p>Morgan Stanley shares are up 2% so far in 2022 and about 35% in the past year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's SPX year-to-date loss of 3.8% and rise of 19% in the last 12 months.</p><p>Don't miss: How young, everyday investors convinced a top billionaire dealmaker to join them as a crypto bull</p>",
