  "text": "<p>Accountancy firm BDO has told staff to decide for themselves when to come to the office after the pandemic, adopting a more flexible approach than banks and professional services groups that have told employees how often they should expect to commute. </p> <p>The UK's fifth-largest accountant, which employs about 5,500 people across 18 offices, will ask staff to work wherever is most productive depending on the task they are doing. For most people this will involve a mixture of working at home, in the office and at client sites, BDO said. </p> <p>“Teams will work out amongst themselves with clients when they should be together and when they won't,” Paul Eagland, BDO's UK managing partner, told the Financial Times. </p> <p>“I can't give you a barcode or an algorithm to tell each person exactly where they need to be and what they need to do but the trust that we can carry forward from the pandemic is that each individual human probably knows what they've got to do,” he said. </p> <p>BDO's decision to let staff and managers decide for themselves when to come to the office puts it at odds with accounting rivals and other companies that are adopting a more prescriptive approach. </p> <p>KPMG UK told its 16,000 employees this month that they will spend a maximum of four days every two weeks in the office after the pandemic while PwC has said its 22,000 UK staff will commute <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e04e5a4-fce6-4007-b032-befde6895a43\">two to three days a week</a> on average. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have ordered staff to be ready to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">return to the office</a> once restrictions are lifted. </p> <p>“Why try to go back to our old way of thinking and saying ‘it must be this, it must be that'?” Eagland said. </p> <p>A staff survey at BDO found that 79 per cent wanted to be able to work from home or have a hybrid working model after the pandemic. </p> <p>The firm has also rewarded staff for their work during the pandemic with the choice of either a bonus of one week's pay in their September pay packet or an extra week's holiday, Eagland said. It follows similar pandemic bonuses at competitors Deloitte, EY and Grant Thornton. </p> <p>BDO furloughed 700 staff last year, unlike the other top six UK accountants which declined to use the scheme, fearing it would inflict reputational damage. The firm initially decided not to repay the £4.1m in taxpayer support because it had not made any redundancies but reversed its position after a public backlash when it reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/009623d8-1253-4256-8ba2-e7f438d6da72\">average profit per partner of £518,000</a> in December. </p> <p>In preparation for hybrid working, BDO will spend £8m on refitting its London and Bristol offices so “it feels like a place people want to turn up”, Eagland said. It plans to follow this by reconfiguring its other offices to make more space for meetings and teamwork in line with other professional services firms. </p> <p>Accountants such as Deloitte and KPMG have confirmed the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de1bf628-b515-466b-9a35-2c8c6fc98abd\">closure of some of their offices</a> because remote working has reduced demand for space, but BDO does not plan to pare back in the medium term, Eagland said. The firm will be able to increase the number of people it employs without renting more space, he added. </p> <p>BDO's offices have remained completely shut since the UK tightened coronavirus restrictions last year and will reopen on Monday for staff who need to attend for wellbeing reasons, the firm said. It has earmarked £10m to be invested over three years in technology to improve remote working.</p><p>Source: Michael O’Dwyer 2021 'Accountancy firm BDO tells staff to work where they want after pandemic' FT.com 17 May.
