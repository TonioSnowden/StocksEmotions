It took just 48 hours.&#xa0;</p> <p>It began on Tuesday as English football clubs<strong> Chelsea</strong> and<strong> Manchester City</strong> were first to say they were preparing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3ab9f68-65b2-4839-96b3-ec4d2928053b\">pull out</a> of the competition. It came just a matter of days after they had agreed to join 10 other clubs from England, Spain and Italy in the league. </p> <p>Within a few hours, the other English football clubs involved — <strong>Arsenal</strong>, <strong>Liverpool</strong>, <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> and <strong>Manchester United</strong> — followed suit.&#xa0;</p> <p>Their exit effectively marks the end of the project and an embarrassing defeat for its powerful architects, which was masterminded by <strong>Florentino Pérez</strong>, a Spanish <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2966b0f3-84a8-494a-ad36-620ed2f3896f\">industrial tycoon</a> and president of <strong>Real Madrid</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Among his supporters in the project who will be laying low after the disastrous reform efforts are <strong>Andrea Agnelli</strong>, a scion of the Italian billionaire dynasty that owns Italy's <strong>Juventus</strong> and whose defection prompted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa8ca103-515a-42d7-8acf-81527114f552\">sharp words</a> from the head of Uefa, European football's governing body.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is also a big blow to bankers at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> who have worked with Pérez for years on the idea and who had committed to underwriting a €3.25bn “infrastructure grant” that would have been shared among the clubs as a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f00bb232-a150-4f7d-b26a-e1b62cd175c3\">welcome bonus</a>” on joining the competition.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>One former JPMorgan banker looks to have lost his job as a result of the mayhem. That would be <strong>Ed Woodward</strong>, Manchester United's executive vice-chair, <a href=\"https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/man-utd-announces-ed-woodward-to-leave-role-at-end-of-2021?utm_campaign=ManUtd&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=twitter\">who the club said </a>would step by the end of this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Their defeats amount to an easy win for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7291cf-1225-4127-8972-6e46cc3f1ce1\">a chorus of politicians</a> — including <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> and<strong> Emmanuel Macron</strong> who were able to tap into the populist anger of fans whose fury came from the Super League's desire to create a competition with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cbef20a-7599-4580-82aa-2af383bd0f5a\">15 permanent members</a> and only five other qualifying spots.</p> <p>It's clear that the Super League's participants hadn't anticipated the wave of opposition they would face by trying to turn the world's favourite sport into a moneymaking machine that would benefit a select circle of clubs to the detriment of all others.</p> <p>As the FT's Murad Ahmed and DD's Arash Massoud<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/arash-massoudi\">i</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e80299a4-8012-447a-8512-c24e149304b1\">revealed on Tuesday morning</a>, backers of the league planned to introduce measures from revenue-sharing arrangements to strict spending limits with the goal of creating a more reliable business model that pays out year after year, akin to US leagues like the <strong>NBA</strong>.</p> <p>Of course, they would also have ensured stakeholders a more steady flow of returns. It's worth pointing out that many participating teams have American owners that identify with the financial structure of US sports:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Liverpool — <strong>John Henry</strong>, the billionaire investor who also owns the <strong>Boston</strong> <strong>Red Sox</strong> baseball team and <strong>The Boston Globe </strong>newspaper;</p></li>  <li><p>Manchester United — the Florida-based <strong>Glazer family </strong>that owns the <strong>NFL</strong>'s<strong> Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong>;&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Arsenal —<strong> Stan Kroenke</strong>, owner of the NFL's<strong> Los Angeles Rams </strong>and the<strong> Denver Nuggets </strong>basketball franchise.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you're thinking this sounds like it's all about the money, that's because it is. Football clubs such as <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> and<strong> Inter Milan</strong> have taken <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86e2dbae-3748-4be4-bb85-0435785b8bf2\">huge hits</a> to their balance sheets since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>And it's not lost on us that the first two clubs to pull out of the Super League are owned by billionaires, who can afford to listen to the fans.</p> <p>Because the plans were so shortlived we did not have time to learn whether broadcasters, streaming services, and sponsors would have signed up to sponsor the Super League matches, which were predicted to generate more than €4bn a year in revenue streams.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's roughly double the amount earned by the <strong>Champions League</strong>, the premier European competition that the Super League sought to displace.&#xa0;</p> <p>One person involved in the Super League talks told Murad: “I read [the terms of the new league] again today, and thought, where the **** are the fans on this?”&#xa0;</p> <p>Today, many of them are likely celebrating.</p> <p>(Don't forget to <a href=\"https://subs.ft.com/scoreboard\">subscribe</a> to our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/scoreboard\">Scoreboard</a> newsletter, produced in conjunction with the DD team and delivered every Saturday morning.)</p> <h2>Credit Suisse: insiders recount the red flags</h2> <p>Earlier this month we chronicled <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s quest to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1333420f-ab58-4a85-b7c6-b7cd5562be8e\">rein in Casino Suisse</a> after consecutive scandals, as it dealt with the blowback from the implosions of <strong>Greensill Capital </strong>and<strong> Bill Hwang</strong>'s <strong>Archegos</strong>.</p> <p>The collapse of Greensill's controversial supply chain finance operation could cost the Swiss bank's clients as much as $3bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>As for Archegos, Credit Suisse itself faces losses of at least $4.7bn. Meanwhile, shareholder payouts have been cancelled and bankers face <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d95855d4-fac2-43eb-a708-2559eddeebf1\">big bonus cuts</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's hard to believe that just five months before Greensill Capital's collapse, Credit Suisse invited a special guest to present to its top ranks in Asia: <strong>Lex Greensill</strong> himself.</p> <p>But then again, maybe not. In interviews with the FT, six current and former Credit Suisse managers said the bank hollowed out risk expertise and trading acumen in favour of promoting salesmen and technocrats. Read it in full <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb708ba2-ea8c-4c66-9190-0255fa5112e3\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The Chinese asset manager testing Beijing's patience for bailouts</h2> <p><strong>Huarong Asset Management</strong>, China's largest distressed debt manager, is no stranger to distress of its own.</p> <p>Its former chair <strong>Lai Xiaomin</strong>, found guilty of taking Rmb1.8bn ($280m) of bribes, was executed in January in a dramatic ending to the most <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/820cf0ec-09a7-4d2e-a86d-897de725d712\">severe corruption case</a> since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, according to the judge.</p> <p>But now all eyes have turned to <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/2aabfd64-6527-442f-b6fb-36c3804dcfc7?\">a far larger sum</a>: the $22bn of dollar-denominated bonds owed by the state-owned company.&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors in those bonds, including <strong>BlackRock</strong>, have been on a rollercoaster ride since Huarong announced it would delay its 2020 results at the end of March, after which trading in its stock was suspended in Hong Kong.</p> <p>The latest moves came on Tuesday evening in Asian time, when prices of Huarong dollar bonds fell after <strong>Reorg Research</strong>, a US-based group, reported that regulators were considering a restructuring.</p> <p>Later that evening, Huarong International, the unit which issues or guarantees most of its offshore debt, said it returned to profit in the first quarter in a statement posted on <strong>WeChat</strong>, the Chinese social media platform.</p> <p>The incident highlights a trade-off for international investors with exposure to corporate China. Companies like Huarong, which is majority owned by the <strong>ministry of finance</strong>, are believed to be fully supported by the government if they come under financial pressure. But these companies can also lack transparency.&#xa0;</p> <p>The west has already undergone over a decade of debate about moral hazard and government bailouts following the near collapse of its banking sector during the financial crisis. In China, the terms of that debate are still taking shape.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Anne Wojcicki</strong>, chief executive and co-founder of <strong>23andMe</strong>, will become a non-executive director of UK-based online used car retailer <strong>Cazoo</strong>'s board following its New York listing via a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9d21ee4-c94a-4b10-aef8-532bf11fcc4f\">blank-cheque deal</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Houlihan Lokey </strong>has hired <strong>Jonathan Guskind</strong> as a managing director in New York. He joins from <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, where he spent more than a decade.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>White &amp; Case </strong>has hired <strong>Lionel Shawe</strong> as a partner in Johannesburg. He joins from<strong> Allen &amp; Overy</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Advisory firm <strong>Gleacher Shacklock</strong> has hired <strong>Petros Stylianides</strong> as a managing director. He was previously at <strong>BMO Capital Markets</strong>, where he co-headed the European power, utilities and infrastructure team.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>The devil still wears Prada </strong>The world is ready for a couture-fuelled “roaring twenties” of post-pandemic luxury, Condé Nast's top editor Anna Wintour tells the FT. But the Vogue publisher's unfashionable history of diversity issues will also define its future.
