  "text": "<p>Vanguard, the world's second-largest asset manager, controls holdings worth $86bn in companies that produce or burn thermal coal, according to a new report that provides a comprehensive assessment of the financial sector's involvement with coal. </p> <p>Asset managers and pension funds have pledged to support targets agreed at the 2015 Paris conference to curtail global warming, which will require huge reductions in fossil fuel consumption. </p> <p>Environmental campaigners complain that the finance industry is more interested in “greenwashing” than addressing the task of decarbonising society. </p> <p>Company holdings exposed to thermal coal worth $1.03tn are still owned by a group of 4,228 institutional investors, including asset managers, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, according to an analysis by Reclaim Finance and Urgewald, two non-profit environmental campaigning groups. </p> <p>Vanguard tops the list followed by BlackRock, Capital Group, State Street and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest public pension scheme. T Rowe Price, JPMorgan and Fidelity also featured in the “dirty thirty” group of institutional investors which control holdings worth $512bn in companies that produce or burn coal. </p> <p>Katrin Ganswindt, head of financial research at Urgewald, said it was “time for the spotlight to shine on Vanguard” as the biggest investor in coal companies worldwide. </p> <p>Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, which is owned by the 30m investors in its funds, holds positions that together are worth almost $86bn across 222 companies that produce or burn coal. </p> <p>The bulk of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b80cd1d-8913-4019-b6aa-b6f6ddb155a5\">Vanguard's $7tn assets</a> is held in passive tracker funds which allocate money based on the market value of each company in broad financial indices. This makes Vanguard a permanent shareholder in almost every listed company globally but it does not have the discretion to sell positions that have weak environmental credentials, unlike an active manager that aims to pick winning stocks. </p> <p>Vanguard said it cared about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\">climate change</a> and it engaged with companies about their oversight and disclosure of climate-related risks. </p> <p>“Companies should pursue globally accepted climate risk mitigation targets, such as those in the Paris agreement, and report on their progress towards meeting those goals. Where companies are not taking the necessary action to mitigate climate risk, we will take action,” said Vanguard. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/eba8dff7-ae9e-47db-b054-c8ed52ad8e79.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>It has pledged to support the Paris agreement but it has not joined Climate Action 100+, a coalition of 545 institutional investors that supports cuts in carbon emissions and improvements in climate disclosures. </p> <p>Ganswindt said Vanguard's words would “ring hollow” if they did not translate into concrete votes on climate risks and divestments from fossil fuel companies.</p> <p>“Vanguard has enjoyed a fair deal of obscurity until now but it has an even worse record on the dirtiest of fossil fuels than BlackRock,” said Ganswindt. </p> <p>BlackRock owns positions worth $84bn spread across 200 companies that produce or burn coal. The world's largest asset manager has divested from fossil fuel companies that generate more than 25 per cent of their revenues from thermal coal in its discretionary active investment portfolios. About $5.7tn of BlackRock's assets are held in tracker funds where it relies on its stewardship team and voting power to pressure companies to align with zero carbon emissions by 2050. </p> <p>“We expect companies to have clear policies and action plans to manage climate risks and to realise the opportunities presented by the global energy transition,” said BlackRock. </p> <p>It voted against management at 69 companies due to climate-related issues at annual shareholder meetings in 2020. BlackRock also intends to ramp up engagement with more than 1,000 carbon-intensive companies in 2021. </p> <p>“BlackRock is still heavily invested in companies launching new fossil fuel projects,” said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investments campaigner at Reclaim Finance.</p> <p>Ganswindt said the “vast majority” of US institutional investors had refused to adopt coal exit policies, in contrast to Europe where the exclusion of fossil fuel companies was becoming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbb179c7-e098-48cd-a980-93e673172a72\">more widely accepted</a>. </p> <p>Capital Group, the $1.9tn Los-Angeles based active manager, said: “ESG issues are complex and don't typically lend themselves to simple ‘yes or no' decisions on sectors.”</p> <p>Paddy McCully, climate and energy programme director at Rainforest Action Network, said the new US administration must address the role of Wall Street as a driver of climate pollution.</p> <p>“Wall Street's massive investments in the coal industry are driving us ever deeper into a climate crisis,” he said.</p><p>Source: Chris Flood 2021 'Vanguard tops list of world's largest coal investors' FT.com 25 February.
