  "title": "Wells Fargo Profit Rises 59% on Reserve Release; Bank beat analyst expectations, but quarterly revenue fell 2%",
  "text": "<p>Big banks are moving beyond the initial shock of last year's pandemic economic collapse and contending with a new normal. Consumers and businesses have largely continued to pay their loans, prompting Wells Fargo to release $1.65 billion of reserves it had stockpiled to cover potential loan losses.</p><p>Net charge-offs fell almost two-thirds from a year earlier.</p><p>But low rates and a fragile economy have curtailed demand for banks' bread and butter business of making loans. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said on Wednesday that its total loans were roughly flat compared with three months earlier, but up 6% versus a year ago.</p><p>Wells Fargo's revenue fell 2% to $18.83 billion. That beat the $18.27 billion expected by analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The bank's net interest income, a measure of lending profit, fell 5% to $8.91 billion. Outstanding loans fell 6% from a year ago, but rose 1% from the prior quarter.</p><p>Third-quarter mortgage originations of $51.9 billion were down about 16% from a year earlier. Auto loan originations jumped roughly 70% to $9.2 billion.</p><p>Noninterest income, which includes fees, was flat at $9.93 billion. Wells Fargo's corporate and investment bank, which is smaller than rivals, posted 25% growth in investment-banking fees but saw a 15% drop in trading revenue.</p><p>Wells Fargo is still trying to work past its five-year-old sales-practice scandal, where it created perhaps millions of phony accounts. In September, Wells Fargo paid a $250 million fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of its top regulators, for failing to fix problems in its mortgage business.</p><p>Another regulator, the Federal Reserve, still has a cap on how much the bank can grow. Charles Scharf, who became chief executive roughly two years ago, has long said that it will take years to complete the work regulators have requested.</p><p>\"I believe we are making significant progress, and I remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years, though we may continue to have setbacks along the way,\" Mr. Scharf said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Scharf has also said he hopes to find $8 billion in annual cost savings. To get there, he has been laying off workers, closing branches and reducing office space. Noninterest expenses fell 13% to $13.3 billion in the third quarter.</p><p>The bank's head count dropped by more than 5,000 during the third quarter, and it is down by more than 21,000 from a year ago.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo have climbed roughly 50% this year. They fell about 2% in Thursday morning trading.</p><p>More on Wall Street Earnings</p><p>Recent stories selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* Bank of America Quarterly Profit Rises 58%</p><p>* Morgan Stanley Profit Rises, Powered by Deal Making, Trading</p><p>* Citigroup Profit Jumps After Releasing Rainy-Day Funds</p><p>* BlackRock Results Helped by Actively Managed Funds</p><p>* Heard on the Street: JPMorgan Shows Why Bank Stocks Are Stuck in Neutral</p><p>Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Wells Fargo Profit Rises 59% on Reserve Release</p>",
