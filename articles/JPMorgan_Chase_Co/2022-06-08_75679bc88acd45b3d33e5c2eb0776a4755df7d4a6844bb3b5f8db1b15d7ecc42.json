  "title": "Fed Pick Michael Barr Approved by Senate Panel, Overcoming Key Confirmation Hurdle; Senate Banking Committee also approved pair of SEC nominees",
  "text": "<p>Support from members of both parties signals confirmation is likely in the narrowly divided Senate over coming weeks. Mr. Barr's prospects for confirmation appeared on track after a May hearing in which no Democrats expressed opposition to him.</p><p>Senate lawmakers also approved two nominees for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Republican Mark Uyeda and Democrat Jaime Lizárraga, advancing their nominations to the full Senate. Their nominations passed the committee by voice vote.</p><p>The supervision role that Mr. Barr could soon take is responsible for developing policy recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>A dean of public policy at the University of Michigan, Mr. Barr would round out Mr. Biden's slate of appointees to the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and three other appointments were confirmed in recent weeks.</p><p>Mr. Barr's expected confirmation would be a win for the Biden administration, which has struggled to advance its financial nominees through the evenly divided Senate. Mr. Biden's first nominee for the banking-supervision post, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew from consideration in March after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, said he couldn't support the nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.</p><p>Mr. Manchin, frequently a moderate swing vote, said last month that he planned to support Mr. Barr. Progressive Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) also have said they would support him.</p><p>Mr. Barr has a record that suggests he might seek to restore at least some of the financial rules that were eased by the Fed during the Trump administration. \"We need to undo the damage caused by the last four years of policy,\" Mr. Barr said in June 2020, referring in part to Trump-era policies that pared back capital and other cash-management requirements for large U.S. lenders.</p><p>Mr. Barr said he wanted to get a broad view of various bank-capital and liquidity requirements before pushing for adjustments to specific rules.</p><p>If confirmed by the full Senate, Mr. Barr would provide the Fed with a full seven-member board for the first time in nearly a decade. The SEC would also return to a full-strength five-member commission—if Messrs. Lizárraga and Uyeda are confirmed—while allowing Democrats to remain in control.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If he is confirmed, what steps should Michael Barr take to regulate the nation's financial institutions? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The SEC currently comprises three Democratic commissioners and one Republican. If confirmed, Mr. Lizárraga would replace Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, a Democrat, who plans to leave once a successor arrives. Mr. Uyeda would fill a vacant seat.</p><p>Mr. Uyeda has advised former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and two former Republican commissioners. Since January 2021, Mr. Uyeda has been temporarily assigned to the Senate Banking Committee as securities counsel to Mr. Toomey, a frequent critic of the current chairman, Gary Gensler. President Biden nominated Mr. Gensler.</p><p>Mr. Lizárraga has served as an aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) for nearly 15 years. Though he isn't well-known among lawyers and lobbyists in the SEC's orbit, Mr. Lizárraga told Senate lawmakers last month that he played key roles in all financial regulation that has moved through Congress in recent decades, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd-Frank Act.</p><p>Fed Pick Michael Barr Approved by Senate Panel, Overcoming Key Confirmation Hurdle</p>",
