  "title": "Sri Lankan Officials Met With Bankers in Bid to Solve Debt Crisis; The island nation faces a July maturity on $1 billion in debt that some don't expect the government to pay",
  "text": "<p>Rothschild declined to comment. Lazard and the Sri Lankan government didn't immediately return requests for comment.</p><p>Sri Lanka's central bank two weeks ago said that it and the government were \"committed to [honor] all forthcoming debt obligations and thereby maintain Sri Lanka's unblemished record of debt servicing\" and that it didn't believe the government needed to restructure its debts.</p><p>The nation has faced an economic crisis since 2020. That year, its economy contracted 3.6% in real terms, the deepest recession since its independence from the U.K. in 1948, according to the central bank.</p><p>Sri Lanka imports the majority of goods it uses to power its economy, and it sells certain commodities like diesel oil to consumers and businesses at fixed prices, leaving the country vulnerable to price swings in global markets. Higher fuel prices have put pressure on the country's foreign-exchange reserves in the past year, and as available funds have dwindled, the country's power grid operator has instituted rolling blackouts amid fuel shortages.</p><p>A major source of tax revenue and foreign-exchange reserves for the country's government stems from tourism, which has declined since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The country's sovereign debt has traded down to distressed levels in recent months as investors voiced concerns about dwindling reserves that can be used for debt repayments.</p><p>Sri Lanka managed to pay off a $500 million sovereign bond that came due last month, but the government has an additional $1 billion bond coming due in July, and analysts said that the country's foreign-exchange reserves may not be sufficient to pay off the debt based on forecast expenditures on imports in the coming months.</p><p>\"Foreign-exchange reserves jumped to $3.1 billion in December…likely due to the central bank drawing down a $1.5 billion [People's Bank of China] swap line,\" wrote Milo Gunasinghe and Trang Nguyen, emerging markets analysts at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., in a Jan. 18 note.</p><p>\"However, questions on how usable the swap line is for purposes other than financing Chinese imports alongside the recent selling of close to half of Sri Lanka's gold reserves likely indicate that near-term [foreign-exchange] liquidity challenges remain,\" the analysts said.</p><p>China has invested heavily in Sri Lanka over the past decade, including loans to help develop a $13 billion seafront business hub in the capital, Colombo, and a port and airport in Hambantota, the home constituency of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa's family.</p><p>Beijing helped finance many of those developments through debt and has taken over certain projects when Sri Lanka's government was unable to repay, including the port in Hambantota that China helped build. To settle the loan, Sri Lanka granted a Chinese state company a 99-year lease on the facility.</p><p>The Sri Lankan government owed more than $16 billion to international bondholders as of April 2021, according to government data. It also owed around $3 billion directly to China as well as to Japan, and around $1 billion to India. Sri Lanka also has outstanding debt to institutional creditors such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p><p>Analysts said a number of avenues are still open to the Sri Lankan government to repay its debts in the coming year, such as a line of credit from the International Monetary Fund or additional bilateral loans, but a difficult macroeconomic picture won't help the government build up more reserves to pay its international debts.</p><p>\"In the absence of meaningful foreign exchange inflows…we think the foreign currency outlook points to uncertainties around external financing beyond the [January] bond maturity,\" wrote Mr. Gunasinghe and Ms. Nguyen in a December 2021 note to clients.</p><p>Soma Biswas contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com and Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p><p>Sri Lankan Officials Met With Bankers in Bid to Solve Debt Crisis</p>",
