Gérald Darmanin, France's interior minister, said 31 people had drowned after the migrant boat capsized, including five women and a girl. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“It was an extremely frail boat, and when the rescuers arrived the boat had deflated like an inflatable garden pool.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The AFP news agency reported that prosecutors in Dunkirk had launched an inquiry into possible offences of people smuggling and aggravated involuntary manslaughter.</p> <p><em>Thank you for reading FirstFT Europe/Africa.

In this episode of the FT podcast Working It, host Isabel Berwick tries to work out what we are worried about.

In other words, it is meant as a joke. That explains a lot. Scott is many things, among them a sometimes peerless grand-design film-maker.
