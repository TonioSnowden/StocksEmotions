  "text": "<p>Iceland has launched the privatisation of state-owned lender Islandsbanki, marking its financial rehabilitation following the collapse of its banks in the 2008 crisis.</p> <p>The country <a href=\"https://www.islandsbanki.is/en/news/ipo\">intends</a> to sell at least a quarter of the bank next month even as it recovers from the Covid-19 shock to its tourism-dominated economy and as it prepares for national elections in September.</p> <p>“This is a big moment for us,” Islandsbanki chief executive Birna Einarsdottir told the Financial Times. “I have been very excited for the past 10 years that this will happen one day.”</p> <p>Islandsbanki was formed in 2008 from the domestic assets of Glitnir, one of the three large Icelandic banks that imploded in the financial crisis, leading to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81bc3a88-0737-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b\">capital controls</a> until 2017 and the conviction of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcdb43d4-bd52-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080\">several leading bankers</a>. Privately owned Arion Bank was the first of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94c36aa0-19cc-11e7-a53d-df09f373be87\">the three</a> to list <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c77ddd90-59b3-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8\">in 2018</a>.</p> <p>Iceland then recovered thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf31fe6a-8ae6-11e6-8cb7-e7ada1d123b1\">boom</a> in tourism, which was stifled first by the bankruptcy of local airline Wow Air in 2019 and then by the pandemic. Unemployment shot up from less than 2 per cent at the end of 2018 to more than 9 per cent at the peak of the pandemic and remains high by Icelandic standards at 8.6 per cent. </p> <p>An Iceland economist said the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26f9c1e4-d5a2-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9\">left-right coalition government</a> seemed to be in a rush to sell Islandsbanki before the September polls. “It's strange, the hurry to do it, and I'm afraid it will be sold for too low a price and that you're missing the opportunity to restructure the banking sector,” he added.</p> <p>Einarsdottir said that Iceland's economy was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c41ba74d-0e34-4a73-b258-d106217b6786\">recovering strongly</a>. Tourists are starting to return to the north Atlantic island of just 360,000 people, attracted among other things by the possibility of seeing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8709c3a2-0085-48cb-88b2-9052ecf59480\">recent volcano explosion</a>. </p> <p>“We have full planes of fully vaccinated Americans coming in,” she said, adding that the bank expected 700,000 visitors this year and 1.3m next, albeit well below the 2018 peak of 2.3m.</p> <p>The economist said there had “clearly been a tourism bubble”, and worried that Arion and Islandsbanki could face pressure to pay out too much to their shareholders.</p> <p>Einarsdottir said that Islandsbanki, whose common equity tier one ratio of 20.1 per cent is high by European standards and above its own long-term target of more than 16 per cent, wanted to return excess capital to shareholders.</p> <p>One of a very few female banking chief executives when she took charge in 2008, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fc0f95d-a492-3843-a1ee-5d0303514a93\">Einarsdottir</a> said that “women get the opportunity when there is a tough situation” but said she was happy with how she cleaned up the bank and its loan book. </p> <p>Islandsbanki offers retail banking and investment banking for large and small companies with a particular focus on sustainability. It aims to have net-zero emissions in relation to its entire loan book by 2040. </p> <p>Bjarni Benediktsson, Iceland's finance minister, said the listing was “an important first step to reduce the Icelandic state's significant ownership in the banking sector” and would provide “a clear path for the state to sell its remaining shares in the bank in the near future”.</p> <p>The IPO will include a public offering to Icelandic retail and institutional investors and a private placement to some foreign shareholders with the shares to be listed on Nasdaq Iceland. Citigroup, Islandsbanki and JPMorgan are joint global coordinators for the IPO.</p><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 2021 'Iceland launches privatisation of state-owned lender Islandsbanki' FT.com 27 May.
