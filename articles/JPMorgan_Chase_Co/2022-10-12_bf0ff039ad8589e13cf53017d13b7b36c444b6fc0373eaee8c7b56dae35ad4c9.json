  "text": "<p>Markets have been on edge this week ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data that will shed light on how much work the Federal Reserve has left to do in containing decades-high price rises.</p><p>Investors have repeatedly been caught wrong-footed in recent months by the persistence of inflation. In recent months, inflation gauges have shown widespread pricing pressures on categories like food and housing, while energy prices have eased.</p><p>U.S. suppliers increased the prices they charge customers by 0.4% in September from a month earlier, according to data released Wednesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.2% increase. That comes ahead of Thursday's crucial consumer-price index release.</p><p>\"Inflation certainly broadened out and entered into areas that were more sticky,\" said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS. \"That's why there's been an increase in expectationsâ€¦that the Fed needs to keep rates at a higher level for longer to get inflation down.\"</p><p>Corporate earnings will also provide insight into how businesses are dealing with price pressures. PepsiCo on Wednesday again lifted its sales outlook for the year as it continues to push through price increases on its snacks and drinks, sending shares up 2.6% premarket.</p><p>The coming days will bring updates from a range of companies including Delta Air Lines and banks like JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Mr. Ganesh said earnings estimates for the remainder of the year and 2023 are too optimistic, posing another risk for stocks in the months ahead.</p><p>\"If you look at market performance so far this year, it's pretty much fully explained by the move in rates and bond yields,\" said Mr. Ganesh. \"Higher rates should mean lower expectations for growth and earnings, and that's not priced into the market yet.\"</p><p>Investors also continue to eye turmoil in U.K. government-bond markets, which have been highly volatile since the government set plans for large, debt-funded tax cuts last month. The Bank of England's attempt to prevent broader market dysfunction that had hit pension funds particularly hard has had mixed results.</p><p>On Tuesday, BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey confirmed that the central bank plans to wind down its bond-market intervention program by Friday as planned, sparking a selloff in the British pound. The message was reiterated by BOE officials on Wednesday.</p><p>U.K. markets were mixed. The pound rebounded 0.7% to $1.1039 but U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, remained under pressure. The 30-year U.K. gilt yield topped 5%, a level last seen before the central bank's intervention. Yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>\"Bond markets think the BOE isn't doing enough,\" said Viraj Patel, a global macro strategist at Vanda Research. Despite the BOE's pledge to wind down bond-buying, Mr. Patel still believes the central bank would step in with support if volatility again threatens financial stability.</p><p>\"They won't let this get to some sort of chaos that spirals out of control,\" he said.</p><p>The U.K.'s FTSE 100 fell about 1% while the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.8%.</p><p>Asian stocks were mixed. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite gained 1.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei 225 index was flat.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude prices slipped 1.5% to $92.87, pulling back further from highs reached when the OPEC+ group of oil producers agreed last week to slash output.</p><p>Write to Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Waver After Wholesale Price Data</p>",
