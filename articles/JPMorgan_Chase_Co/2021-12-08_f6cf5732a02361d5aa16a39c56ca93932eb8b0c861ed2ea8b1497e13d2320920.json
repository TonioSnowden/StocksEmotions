  "text": "<p>The euro EURUSD rose against the dollar DXY and the pound GBPUSD, which hit low of $1.3173 after a report in the Financial Times said the U.K. will announce fresh COVID restrictions — vaccine passports for big venues and a work-from-home order — to battle surging cases.</p><p>Pfizer PFEsaid Wednesday that three doses — two vaccinations plus a booster — of the COVID vaccine it has developed with BioNTech BNTX appeared to keep the omicron variant at bay, though it stressed the results were from preliminary lab studies.</p><p>Technology stocks led the losses in Europe, with Infineon Technologies DE:IFXA dropping over 3% after a downgrade to neutral at JP Morgan, where analysts said semiconductor cycle risks are increasing as inventories normalize. ASML Holding NL:ASM dropped 1%, and ASM International NL:ASM stock slipped 0.9%.</p><p>Pharmaceutical names were higher, with Roche CH:ROG up 1.7% and Novo Nordisk NVODK:NOVO.B stock up over 2%.</p><p>The most heavily weighted stock on the Stoxx Europe 600, Nestlé NSRGYCH:NESN, climbed 2% after the Swiss food giant agreed to cut its stake in L'Oréal FR:OR in a sale of $10 billion worth of shares back to the French cosmetics maker.</p><p>Wednesday also marked a changing of the guard for Germany, as center-left leader Olaf Scholz became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor Wednesday, beginning a new era for the EU's biggest economy, also struggling to get its own COVID outbreak under control.</p><p>According to data from FactSet, the German DAX gained 220% throughout Chancellor Angela Merkel's 16-year chancellorship, though analysts stressed that it was tough to extrapolate much from politics. During her 2005 to 2021 leadership, the German market followed Wall Street into the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and 2009.</p><p>FactSetAs for her predecessors, the German DAX rose 16% under Gerhard Schröder, who served from 1998 to 2005, but 347% under Helmut Kohl who also served 16 years, according to FactSet data.</p><p>The benchmark DAX stock index (1876534) surged 30% between October 1989 and July 1990 with Kohl overseeing the post-reunification boom. The euro's introduction, and the dot-com bubble were also big influential events for German stocks.</p><p>Uncredited</p>",
