  "text": "<p>Ms. Omarova said there is a misperception. There is an \"unfortunate misunderstanding of my position with respect to community banks,\" she said in an interview. \"I actually am a huge supporter of community banks that channel credit to American families and businesses in their communities.\"</p><p>While speaking by video chat from her home in Ithaca, N.Y., she said she supports free markets but wants to prevent banks from reaping all of the gains from their risk-taking while \"socializing\" losses on taxpayers, a reference to the bank bailouts during the 2007-09 financial crisis.</p><p>\"I want to protect the American taxpayer, basically, from holding the bag,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Omarova's defenders, including liberal-leaning Democrats, say she is an accomplished banking expert who will stand up to the industry. They say that Washington regulators have been too deferential to big banks and that Ms. Omarova would work to make the financial system more inclusive for consumers.</p><p>With objections coming from the financial industry, including community bankers who hold sway with some key moderate Democrats, and likely unified opposition from Republicans, Ms. Omarova faces an uncertain path to the job in a narrowly divided Senate, which has approved Mr. Biden's picks for other top regulatory posts. She could have a confirmation hearing as soon as this month.</p><p>Before becoming a professor, Ms. Omarova worked at a large law firm and had a stint as an adviser at the Treasury Department during the George W. Bush administration. She left the department for her first teaching job in North Carolina.</p><p>Despite her background, banks fear Ms. Omarova would carry out a progressive agenda if confirmed, imposing undue restrictions on their business, according to bankers and their lobbyists. They cite a 2019 article in which she argued that the Fed should shrink large banks in certain circumstances. Another recent paper envisioned shifting consumer-bank deposits from private firms to the Fed, a structural change she described as radical to help make finance more inclusive.</p><p>Ms. Omarova said in the article that shifting all consumer deposits to the Fed could boost, not harm, community banks, because they could charge fees for hosting the accounts on behalf of the Fed. They would also have a large pool of customers with which to offer investment advice and other financial services, she says.</p><p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent bureau of the Treasury Department. It oversees about 1,200 banks with total assets of $14 trillion, about two-thirds of the total in the U.S. banking system. The agency is one of the most powerful bank regulators in Washington, alongside the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. While the bulk of the job revolves around supervising the day-to-day operations of the world's largest banks, its leader can't order changes at the Fed.</p><p>Banking advocates are also rankled by Ms. Omarova opinions on Twitter, where she has repeatedly attacked the industry. She criticized merger activity at JPMorgan that would expand the U.S.'s largest lender, as well as this summer's end to pandemic-related restrictions on big-bank share buybacks and dividends.</p><p>The Biden administration has struggled to find a comptroller nominee who would be embraced by its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. Earlier this year the White House abandoned an Obama-era Treasury Department official it had considered for the post after he drew opposition from progressive Democrats.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
