  "title": "Companies and Nonprofits Expand Efforts to Hire Veterans; Some programs also help spouses of veterans find jobs—relieving a big stress for military families",
  "text": "<p>\"You're seeing better programs that are coming from lessons learned and that are much more tailored to where the specific needs are,\" says Crystal Cochran, senior director of programs and events at Hiring Our Heroes, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce initiative that works to connect the military community with meaningful employment opportunities.</p><p>Here's a sampling of some of these initiatives.</p><p>Hiring</p><p>Veteran Jobs Mission, a coalition of more than 250 companies dedicated to employing talent from the U.S. military community, recently set a goal to hire a total of two million vets and 200,000 military spouses by 2032, says Mark Elliott, who heads military and veterans affairs at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., a founding member of the coalition. That represents an expansion of the group's initial commitment to hire 100,000 veterans by 2020, a target set when the coalition had only 11 corporate partners.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase itself has hired more than 16,000 veterans since 2011. One of those hires is Abe Blocker, who joined in 2017 through a three-month training program. \"I never would have gotten the mobility, the opportunities and the mentorship without the program,\" says Mr. Blocker who began as an associate in prime brokerage and became a private banker in June.</p><p>Amazon.com Inc. pledged in July 2021 to hire 100,000 U.S. veterans and military spouses by 2024. The company currently employs more than 45,000 veterans and military spouses across its businesses. The company's Military Skills Translator program allows veterans to fill out a short form online with information such as their branch of service, rank, years in the military and active-duty status, and the company uses the information to match them with potential job opportunities. There is a similar option for military spouses.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What else should companies do to improve employment prospects for veterans and their spouses? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. recently expanded its Veteran Employment Transition program to twice a year. The eight-week paid-internship program offers participants the opportunity to convert directly to a full-time role based on their performance. Last year, the bank hired 44 veterans from this program, and it hopes to hire 130 people this year, says Maggie Reinagel, head of military talent events and programs at Wells Fargo.</p><p>Career services</p><p>Personalized career-counseling programs are springing up to help veterans present their skills and experience in the best light. According to the Veterans Metrics Initiative, a continuing study that assesses the effectiveness of veteran transitions, veterans are nearly three times as likely to find a job if they practice interviewing with a coach or mentor, and twice as likely to find a job if an experienced mentor or coach helps them with résumé writing.</p><p>\"Every veteran has a different story,\" says Dan Goldenberg, executive director of the Call of Duty Endowment, a nonprofit that funds organizations that provide free job-related help to veterans. \"They need personalized help translating their military service so that hiring managers and employers can understand the value to their organization.\"</p><p>Shift.org helps veterans do just that, says Mike Slagh, the organization's founder and CEO. The idea is to make sure \"they present a compelling story and get a lot of visibility,\" he says. Over the past few years, more than 30,000 veterans and those in the process of transitioning to civilian life have used Shift's community platform, career-advancement offerings and hiring partner network of more than 100 companies, he says.</p><p>Phoenix-based 50strong, an organization backed by employers including Amazon, ADP and Wells Fargo, offers a program called EmployerConnect that gives active-duty service members and veterans exposure to employers seeking military talent. Kandi Tillman, managing co-founder, describes the program as a \"virtual bar\" where up to 20 employers host large virtual-networking events. There are typically two events a month that attract around 200 to 350 military-community participants, she says.</p><p>Entrepreneurship training</p><p>Although programs for veteran entrepreneurs have grown since the mid-2000s, many vet entrepreneurs still struggle to get their businesses off the ground. Forty-nine percent cite a lack of initial capital, and 43% say they have problems finding good employees or contractors, according to a 2021 study from Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families.</p><p>One of the institute's most recent programs is Spark, a six-week virtual program, free to veterans, military spouses and life partners, that helps budding entrepreneurs test their business ideas and learn skills related to value creation, marketing, sales, personal branding, value delivery and finance.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase offers a yearlong incubator for businesses led by veterans or military spouses. The main goal of the CEOcircle program, developed with Bunker Labs, is to help accelerate growth through education and connections. The current program, which runs through November, has 41 participants across industries. The next program, which starts in November, will host 80 businesses, according to a spokeswoman.</p><p>Military spouses</p><p>Military-spouse unemployment is another huge stressor for military families, and one that more companies and organizations are trying to address.</p><p>\"We really need to make sure [military spouses] are an equal part of the conversation around military talent because it's having an impact on military families,\" says Ms. Cochran of Hiring Our Heroes. \"When military spouses cannot be gainfully employed, there are a lot of ramifications.\"</p><p>Wells Fargo is aiming to hire 500 military spouses over the next five years through its recently announced Military Spouse Homefront Heroes Hiring program. </p><p>The Seattle headquarters of Amazon, which has pledged to hire 100,000 U.S. veterans and military spouses by 2024.

The company says it launched the tool, dubbed Project Juno, after being told by military spouses that a family move was their No. 1 reason for leaving the company. Employees enter where they are moving and when, and the tool helps them find the same job or a similar role near their new location.</p><p>Underemployment</p><p>Research suggests many veterans don't advance as quickly in civilian careers as their non-veteran peers, or don't have jobs that maximize their skills and abilities, a problem known as underemployment. According to the Veterans Metrics Initiative, 61% of veterans are underemployed and 55% believe that they are more experienced than their current job requires.</p><p>Many of the existing programs don't address why this is happening, says Sean Kelley, an executive in residence at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. That's something he and others at the school's Veteran Transition Research Initiative are trying to change.</p><p>Hiring managers tend to bypass veterans for positions where high levels of human interaction are required, according to research by Aaron Kay, a management professor at Duke's Fuqua School and co-leader of research at the school's veteran-transition initiative. This is true even when candidates are otherwise equal, he says. Studying these biases and understanding them could help employers create programs that better address veterans' career-development obstacles, he says.</p><p>Increasing hiring and skill-building are only part of the equation, Dr. Kay says. \"There needs to be a more complete understanding, and the intervention needs to target it from multiple sides.\"</p><p>Ms. Winokur Munk is a writer in West Orange, N.J.
