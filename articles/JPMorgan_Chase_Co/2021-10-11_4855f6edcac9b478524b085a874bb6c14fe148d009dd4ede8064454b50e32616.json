  "text": "<h1>Larry Fink: BlackRock's ten trillion dollar man</h1> <blockquote>  <p><em>“Sometimes you are aware when your great moments are happening, and sometimes they rise from the past. Perhaps it's the same with people.”</em> ― James Salter</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>BlackRock</strong>'s initial public offering, on October 1 1999, was not a “great moment”. It bombed. The listing arranged by Merrill Lynch valued BlackRock at just under $900m — much lower than expected. The asset manager's founder and chief executive <strong>Larry Fink </strong>was even tempted to scrap the whole thing. But Merrill chief executive <strong>David Komansky</strong> had a coarse tongue, and no intention of letting that happen. &#xa0;</p> <p>“What the fuck are you doing?” he yelled at Fink. “Just do the IPO. If you do your job well over the next four to five years, it will be a distant memory. Just do the fucking IPO now. Don't be a fucking asshole.” Point made.</p> <p>Twenty-two years and a crisis-era acquisition of <strong>Barclays</strong>' asset management arm later, Fink has cemented his position as the King of Wall Street, as my colleague <em>Robin Wigglesworth </em>reveals in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dfd1e3d-e256-4656-a96d-1204538d75cd\">must-read profile</a>. </p> <p>BlackRock's seminal acquisition of <strong>Barclays Global Investors</strong> — the biggest deal in asset management history — combined its traditional “active” investment strategies and BGI's dominant focus on “passive” index funds, sowing the seeds for phenomenal growth since then. </p> <p>Now, BlackRock's profit margins outweigh those of <strong>Apple </strong>or <strong>Google</strong>, and its $126bn market capitalisation is greater than the combined values of its rivals <strong>TRowe Price</strong>, <strong>Franklin Templeton</strong>, <strong>Invesco</strong>, <strong>Janus Henderson</strong>, <strong>Schroders</strong> and <strong>State Street</strong>.</p> <p>Assuming its recent pace of growth has continued, BlackRock could reveal in its third-quarter results on Wednesday that its assets under management have crossed the $10tn mark. </p> <p>All of this presents many questions for investors. Should one company wield so much power? Does BlackRock hold itself to the same ESG and corporate governance standards that it demands of its portfolio companies? And who will succeed in the <em>Game of Throne</em>s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fda23812-d724-4112-a5ec-78b836a89894\">battle to succeed</a> Fink (if he ever retires)?</p> <p>But, recalling the “trillion-dollar suit” worn by BlackRock's Mark Wiedman at a party in June 2014 to celebrate its iShares business crossing the $1tn mark, perhaps the more pressing question is sartorial. How will BlackRock's top team attire themselves for the $10tn celebrations? (My colleague <em>Rob Armstrong </em>in New York has some good advice on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e2a31d5-b456-4e02-9b4f-9b80531f470e\">how to wear trainers</a> as a middle-aged man.)</p> <p>Robin's book <em>“</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241422051?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0241422051\"><em>Trillions</em></a><em>: How a Band of Wall Street Renegades Invented the Index Fund and Changed Finance Forever”, will be published by Penguin Random House on October 12</em></p> <h1>State Street's dealmaking dilemma</h1> <p>The contours of BlackRock's 2006 deal to buy Merrill Lynch Investment Managers were famously thrashed out in 15 minutes over breakfast. Fink and Merrill Lynch's CEO <strong>Stan O'Neal </strong>even signed the menu at 3 Guys, a restaurant on the Upper East Side, to commemorate the provisional agreement. </p> <p>But most <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/092d8b5c-14cd-4499-9745-a1bc71cc951d\">asset management deals</a> are much more laboured. Just ask <strong>Nelson Peltz</strong>, the veteran activist investor who is trying to drive consolidation in the industry. </p> <p>One target in particular is in his sights. After Peltz's fund <strong>Trian Partners </strong>bought a stake in <strong>Invesco </strong>last year, it immediately began discussions about a marriage between Invesco and State's Street's $3.9tn asset management business.</p> <p>This may make strategic sense. But as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2429963d-34af-4cbd-9bd1-ea9cf22d5ae2\">this analysis</a> by <em>Chris Flood </em>in London and <em>Michael Mackenzie </em>and <em>James Fontanella-Khan</em> in New York shows, it must overcome considerable barriers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I recently took part in an online discussion on M&amp;A with some of the industry's top executives at our Future of Asset Management, North America summit. (If you missed it, catch up on the recorded talks <a href=\"https://foam.live.ft.com/page/1725403/watch-on-demand\">here</a>).&#xa0;</p> <p>All four panellists said they were in the market for acquisitions, and here's what's on their wishlists: </p> <p><strong>George Gatch</strong>, CEO of JPMorgan Asset Management: “sustainability, indexing, customisation and fintech”.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Jenny Johnson</strong>, president and chief executive of <strong>Franklin Templeton</strong>: “alternatives space, high-net-worth expansion, fintech”.</p> <p><strong>Michael Janiszewski</strong>, chief operating officer, asset servicing and digital at <strong>BNY Mellon</strong>: “private markets, ETF solutions, ESG, active fixed income and alternative currencies”. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Collin Roche</strong>, co-CEO and managing director of <strong>GTCR</strong>: “good businesses that we can invest into and help them to improve and realise their potential.”&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Faites vos jeux! </em></p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>The rise in demand for sustainable investments is driving a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92715635-17c6-4e4a-9c71-7b5ab270bd46\">structural reboot</a>” of private market investing in Europe, with environmental, social and governance funds set to account for up to two-fifths of the industry's assets in just a few years. </p> <p>But not everyone faces the same pressure to conform to ESG norms. Be sure to read <em>Laurence Fletcher's</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed11c971-be02-47dc-875b-90762b35080e\">report</a> on how hedge funds have been quietly scooping up the shares of unloved oil and gas companies discarded by environmentally minded institutional investors. They're now reaping big gains as energy prices surge. “They [big institutional investors] are all so keen to get rid of oil assets, they're leaving fantastic returns on the table,” says <strong>Crispin Odey</strong>, whose European fund is up more than 100 per cent so far this year.</p> <h1>News round-up</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f9bbc77-06b1-4fbd-8b7e-6e381ba038a7\">Day traders phone up gambling helplines as game-like broker apps spread </a>(FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e8a4b14-3450-4be3-8526-2cc184f0ebfe\">BlackRock to give clients the right to vote</a> (FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9b5189-0b0e-4b83-a2e7-533f3ac85733\">Citadel Securities founder ‘quite fine' with ending payment for order flow </a>(FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69c28c74-e957-4009-912a-aee1c452995d\">Private equity pays record premiums for public companies</a> (FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fc2dacb-3e96-495a-9941-db0b7ee43877\">Cathie Wood's flagship ETF hit by record outflows in September</a> (FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07148f42-64e2-42f2-a8cd-cad1a3255790\">Tackle greenwashing to boost sustainable investment, says IMF</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7cfb95e-b451-4430-aa1f-d0e25decf8a0\">Financial cleansing deters investment in China</a> (FT Opinion)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44b6ca25-a827-4336-bf36-7da442cbb38d\">Top financiers due to attend UK green investor summit</a> (FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea04e3c1-4105-4411-b0ac-33449d1f3511\">Investors suffer 60/40 blues as investment mainstay takes a hit</a> (FT)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3077de6-4b78-4bd2-9ccd-4a870541ff2b\">US regulator warns leveraged ETPs pose systemic risk to markets</a> (FT)</p> <h1>And finally:</h1> <p>Frieze London and Frieze Masters return in person this week, after a two-year hiatus.
