  "text": "<p>Wall Street banks are splashing the cash. Record M&amp;A activity and surging initial public offerings mean bankers are in line for outsized bonuses this year. But bumper payouts run the risk of alienating investors.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs is considering increasing its bonus pool for its investment bankers by about 40-50 per cent compared with last year. At JPMorgan Chase, the increase could be as much as 40 per cent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c4638b-2663-4fa2-9fa3-8608d488d227\">the Financial Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Industry-wide, this year's expected bonus increases could be the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/16/2335295/0/en/Wall-Street-Sees-Banner-Year-For-Bonuses-Johnson-Associates-Analysis-Finds.html\">biggest</a> since 2009, according to compensation consultant Johnson Associates. Investment bankers and equities traders are set to receive the largest slices of the pie. </p> <p>From a returns standpoint, that is justified — even though financing activity has been heavily underpinned by state support for the US economy amid pandemic challenges.</p> <p>In the US, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley collectively took in more than $40bn in revenue from their investment banks during the first nine months of 2021. That is a 44 per cent surge from the prior-year period.</p> <p>Yet the largesse could also set banks up in a potential tug of war with their investors. They grumble that bankers are well rewarded in good years but shielded in bad times.</p> <p>Data from the Office of the New York State Comptroller show Wall Street losses almost <a href=\"https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/press/pdf/wall-street-profits-2015.pdf\">quadrupled to $43bn</a> during the Great Recession in 2008. Yet the bonus pool for that year shrank by <a href=\"https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/press/pdf/wall-street-bonus-pool-2015.pdf\">only 47 per cent</a>. </p> <p>Still, investors have not done too poorly. The KBW Bank index has delivered a 35 per cent return this year. The biggest US banks have collectively announced plans to return billions of dollars to investors in the form of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4f446b1-a71d-4656-a81f-f2bcaf97c9ba\">stock buybacks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c904432-479c-45b3-84e5-857a06bdadb5\">dividends</a>.</p> <p>In a tight jobs market, banks need to retain talent but also keep a lid on costs. Loan growth is not expected to come roaring back next year. Trading and dealmaking could slow. </p> <p>Bank bosses have a lot riding on their efficiency ratios, a measure of expenses to revenue. Bonus profligacy would derail the sector's strong run.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Wall Street bonuses: asymmetric rewards set bankers up for griping' FT.com 15 December.
