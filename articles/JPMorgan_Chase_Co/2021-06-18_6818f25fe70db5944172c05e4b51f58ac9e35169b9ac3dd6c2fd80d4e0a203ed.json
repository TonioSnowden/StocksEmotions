  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>Toshiba's biggest shareholder has declared the Japanese conglomerate's board “ineffective” and accused the company of failing to respond adequately to a report showing it colluded with the government to suppress activist investors. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef743f3b-ea27-4afe-ba61-79365e2a808c\">More here</a>.</p> <h2>JPMorgan prepares to plant its Chase flag in the City</h2> <p>In football, “nutmegging” refers to a particularly sneaky manoeuvre in which the ball is dribbled between the defender's legs to evade one's opponent.</p> <p>With its purchase of the UK robo-adviser <strong>Nutmeg</strong>, <strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>hopes to have jockeyed a similarly well-timed play as part of its plans to crack the UK retail banking market.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank has agreed to buy the British investment platform for an undisclosed price, which sources <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f76ed493-6611-4308-8c06-30dff37715d0\">told the FT</a> valued the company at about £700m.</p> <p>It's a sign that JPMorgan's plans for the UK market go beyond just current accounts, which it plans to launch through its Chase brand later this year.</p> <p>The British banking market is a tough nut to crack. With the exception of a few digital-focused start-ups like <strong>Monzo</strong> and <strong>Starling Bank</strong>, entrenched incumbents <strong>NatWest</strong>, <strong>Lloyds</strong>, <strong>Barclays </strong>and <strong>HSBC</strong> have long-dominated the territory. (For more on the fintechs trying to disrupt the big UK banks, subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/fintechft\">#fintechFT</a> newsletter <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/subscribe?result=%7B%22successful%22%3A%5B%7B%22newsletterId%22%3A%22575981ede74eb90300a44d8e%22%7D%5D%2C%22unsuccessful%22%3A%5B%5D%7D\">here</a>.)</p> <p>By acquiring Nutmeg, JPMorgan is hoping to bolster its fledgling UK retail business. The lossmaking company has expanded rapidly since its launch in 2012 to manage £3.5bn in assets for about 140,000 customers.</p> <p>The US bank has already enlisted several City veterans for its cause, including former Lloyds chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a2b888a-b5bf-11e3-81cb-00144feabdc0\"><strong>Win Bischoff</strong></a> and <strong>Clive Adamson</strong>, previously a senior official at the <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong>. Both were brought on board <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d9be53-d8d2-478b-8740-4ce0a3f23b05\">back in January</a> to help with its expansion project into the UK retail market.</p> <p>The deal was secured following a brief courtship, which came as Nutmeg was hunting for funding and JPMorgan instead proposed.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> — which is an investor in Nutmeg — has already made inroads in the UK market. It introduced the <strong>Marcus</strong> consumer brand into the country three years ago. It plans to expand its robo-adviser, Marcus Invest, in the second half of 2021.&#xa0;</p> <p>Robo-advisers “have burnt a lot of cash trying to get clients through the door”, <strong>Jason Hollands</strong>, managing director at UK wealth manager<strong> Tilney Smith &amp; Williamson</strong> told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>“If you don't start off with a client base and you have to acquire them through marketing, it's an expensive business model.”</p> <h2>Night of the Living Bellheads</h2> <p>If AT&amp;T were a TV show, it would have more spin-offs than <em>Happy Days</em>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The company's big play to transform itself into a streaming service was abruptly cancelled last month when it announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a424c8ae-c879-455c-8b57-fcf0605f03af\">plans to merge</a> its <strong>WarnerMedia</strong> business with <strong>Discovery</strong> into a new company.&#xa0;</p> <p>That came only months after it signed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b8f8899-12f6-4699-bd65-1229b7a78ad2\">deal</a> with private equity company<strong> TPG</strong> to separate its <strong>DirecTV </strong>satellite business.&#xa0;</p> <p>The shock and awe of the separation across the media sector was palpable, but few questioned the logic, as the FT's Nic Fildes and DD's James Fontanella-Khan report in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0712c618-0a08-49a9-8f62-5d77c51f9e5e\">this Big Read</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>AT&amp;T was loaded with debt and its value wasn't reflecting the growth potential of either its telecoms or media assets.</p> <p>For those with long memories, the media split is just the latest reinvention for “Ma Bell”, as AT&amp;T was coined in its monopoly days. The group has seen its big plans dashed time and again since regulators broke up what was once the world's largest company.</p> <p>It tried and failed to turn itself into a computing powerhouse in 1991 via the $7.4bn takeover of cash machine and computer maker <strong>NCR</strong> — the largest tech deal completed at the time. Instead, the business was split into three.&#xa0;</p> <p>A decade later, a $100bn deal spree to build a cable empire coincided with a collapse in the economy and the cable businesses were spun out. In 2011, an attempt to buy <strong>T-Mobile</strong> for $39bn backfired as regulators blocked the deal.</p> <p>One banker told the FT that AT&amp;T's deals have built successful empires, but for other companies.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Nokia </strong>now owns<strong> Bell Labs</strong>, <strong>Comcast </strong>became the beneficiary of the cable spin-off, while T-Mobile was reborn as the “uncarrier” and took huge amounts of share from its rivals.&#xa0;</p> <p>If history repeats itself, then Discovery could well come out of the WarnerMedia deal with a huge ratings boost.&#xa0;</p> <p>For AT&amp;T, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd93a1d8-3127-42e3-beb2-80c02d138013\">media split</a> represents a chance to get back to basics. The telecoms side of the business, run by the company's “bellheads”, is now back at the core of its 5G-centric strategy.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Ma Bell should have been dead and buried by now,” the media mogul <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3ed18ec-ad36-4e3e-84ff-36197701769f\"><strong>Barry Diller</strong></a> marvelled in an interview with CNBC. Yet the bellheads will ensure what was once the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company will live to fight another day.</p> <h2>Family feud: brothers-in-law duke it out in a Spac battle of the ages</h2> <p>DD readers know by now that the Spac market has been a rollercoaster.&#xa0;</p> <p>There have been triumphs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88d7f577-9bfa-4215-b57b-0f8a4da3644a\">pitfalls</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/654ab764-2e19-441e-91e3-b535f5f14af2\">short-selling sceptics</a> that have questioned whether the ride was safe enough to get on in the first place.</p> <p>One company eager to strap in for Spac-land was <strong>Velodyne Lidar</strong>, the leading US manufacturer of lidar systems, the rotating laser devices used by self-driving vehicles to “see” roads and obstacles.</p> <p>But its rickety ride serves as a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of special purpose acquisition companies, as DD's Miles Kruppa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/509bf84a-61ae-4f54-b1f3-e3c09fcc8f28\">reports</a>. Taking a joyride on these investment vehicles can offer a lucrative shortcut to public markets, but it's a route often taken by risky, founder-controlled businesses.</p> <p>So goes the tale of <strong>David Hall</strong> and<strong> Brad Culkin</strong>: inventors, longtime colleagues and brothers-in-law who now find themselves, as Hall described to Miles, locked in a “fight to the death”.</p> <p>Since listing through a $1.6bn deal with a Spac called <strong>Graf</strong> in September, the two men's public squabble for power over the company has escalated dramatically.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hall, Velodyne's founder, was removed as chair after pushing for changes that would grant him more power over the board.</p> <p>Last week he struck back at Culkin, who replaced him as chair, and others on the board who helped remove him by wielding his majority voting power to install activist investor <strong>Eric Singer</strong> on the board.</p> <p>We recommend reading Miles's reporting in full for all the lurid details. But for now we'll leave you with a final word from Hall on Singer's alleged plans.</p> <p>“He's going to drive those cockroaches out of there,” Hall told DD. “I want them gone and to never hear from them again for the rest of my life, and my children's lives as well.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Microsoft boss <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> has also been named chair of the software company, ending two decades of separation between the positions and making him only the second person to hold both roles in the company's 46-year history. He replaces <strong>John Thompson</strong>, who took over as chair from <strong>Bill Gates</strong> in 2014 and will move to lead independent director.

He has served as interim CFO since January, when his predecessor <strong>Jakob Stausholm</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b92f8fca-4861-4041-897e-bcf8dcce367d\">took over</a> as chief executive following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd75d6da-f047-49d4-9b2e-cfc2ef95df00\">departure</a> of <strong>Jean-Sébastien Jacques</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>KKR </strong>has appointed <strong>Adriane Brown</strong> to its board of directors.
