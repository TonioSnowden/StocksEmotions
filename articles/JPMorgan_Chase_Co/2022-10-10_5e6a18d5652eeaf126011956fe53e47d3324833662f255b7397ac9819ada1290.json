  "text": "<p>How stocks are trading</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 erased earlier losses to tick up 3.50 points, or 0.1%, to 3,656.75.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 rose 63 points, or 0.2%, to 29,416.</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 were down 9.50 points, or 0.1%, at 11,092.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 630 points, or 2.1%, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 2.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 3.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 31.9% for the year to date through Friday.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks were in line for a fourth consecutive session of losses as concerns about additional interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve continued to dampen sentiment.</p><p>Trading was expected to be somewhat thinned by the Columbus Day and Indigenous People's Day holiday, which closed the Treasury market.</p><p>Soft data a week ago raised hopes that the Fed would soon pause its monetary tightening cycle in its battle to suppress multi-decade high inflation, and the market subsequently rebounded off its near two-year lows. But a strong jobs report on Friday crushed that Fed \"pivot\" narrative and stocks plunged again.</p><p>See: Why stock-market investors keep falling for Fed 'pivot' talk â€” and what it will take to put in a bottom</p><p>The 5-day round trip saw an average move for the S&amp;P 500 of 1.9%. Little surprise then that the CBOE Vix index VIX, a gauge of expected S&amp;P 500 volatility, sat on Monday at 31.4, more than 50% above its long term average of 20.</p><p>\"The market response to Friday's U.S. jobs report was characteristic of a bear market in equities. U.S. indices reversed sharply in the absence of the bad economic news required to shake the Fed's hawkish determination,\" said Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt.</p><p>Now traders will look toward more data due later in the week for further guidance on Fed thinking and equity valuations.</p><p>The U.S. producer price numbers will be released on Wednesday and the consumer prices report on Thursday, the last of their kind before the Fed's rate-setting meeting on Nov. 2.</p><p>Then on Friday, third-quarter corporate earnings season really kicks into gear when big banks like JPMorgan JPM and Citigroup C present their numbers.</p><p>Read: JPMorgan, Citi, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo kick off bank earnings season in choppy waters</p><p>\"The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 is 2.4%. If 2.4% is the actual growth rate for the quarter, it will mark the lowest earnings growth rate reported by the index since Q3 2020 (-5.7%),\" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at Factset.</p><p>Further hurting risk appetite on Monday was additional gains for the dollar, whose strength is considered a drag on the earnings of U.S. multinationals. The dollar index DXY rose 0.3% to 113.15 as the euro broke back below $0.97 after Russia sent missiles into cities across Ukraine.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Rivian Automotive Inc. RIVN intends to recall about 13,000 vehicles due to a possible safety issue that has so far been found to have impacted several units, the company said Friday night. Shares were down 7.1% in premarket trade.</p><p>* Tesla Inc. TSLA reported record monthly sales of China-made electric vehicles in September, as it continues to ramp production in the world's number-two economy. The electric-vehicle maker delivered 83,135 EVs in September, an 8% rise from August, according to a report by the China Passenger Car Association on Sunday. Tesla shares were down 0.2%.</p><p>Stock futures struggle for direction amid Fed rate-hike gloom</p>",
