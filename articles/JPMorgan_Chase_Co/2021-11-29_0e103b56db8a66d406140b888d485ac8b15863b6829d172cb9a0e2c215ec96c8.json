  "text": "<p>Still, “as long as there are no new lockdowns that would derail the economic recovery, then oil should stabilize,” analysts at Sevens Report Research wrote in Monday's newsletter.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery&#xa0;CL00CLF22 was up $4.01, or 5.9%, to $72.16. The contract slid $10.24, or 13.1%, to close at $68.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday, the biggest one-day drop for a front-month contract since April 20, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>January Brent crude BRNF22, the global benchmark, rose $3.41, or 4.6%, to $76.13 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. On Friday, Brent tumbled $9.50, or 11.6%, to $72.72 a barrel, the biggest one-day percentage decline since April 21, 2020, with both WTI and Brent seeing their lowest closes since Sept. 9.</p><p>Friday's selloff came on a shortened day of trading following the Thanksgiving Day holiday, with lower volumes potentially exacerbating any moves. The view that Friday's selling went too far was gaining momentum at the start of the week, as U.S. benchmark stock indexes traded mostly higher.</p><p>“The decline in the&#xa0;oil&#xa0;price, over concerns that any new restrictions could impact demand also appears somewhat overdone, which helps explain this morning's subsequent rebound, although it will be welcome news for beleaguered consumers, who have had to endure sharp increases in petrol prices,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, in a note to clients.</p><p>A growing view emerging from last week is that the sharp selloff will give major oil producing nations a reason to pause planned production increases. A pair of technical meetings for Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this week has reportedly been shifted so that the group can assess the variant.</p><p>OPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, pushed a joint technical committee to Wednesday from Monday, according to Bloomberg and other media outlets, citing sources. A joint ministerial monitoring committee has reportedly been shifted to Thursday from Tuesday.</p><p>Following a monthly meeting in early November, the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, where a decision on production levels is expected, was scheduled for Thursday, Dec. 2.</p><p>“The big market signal this week will come from how OPEC+ decides to respond to the threat of the omicron variant,” said Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, in a Monday note.</p><p>“The group is not habitual in making knee-jerk policy decisions, and prefers to stay behind the demand curve, so we could expect either a continued conservative approach of bringing back 400,000 [barrels per day] on a monthly basis, or an even more cautious maneuver that holds even more supply back until the COVID-19 impact chips fall on the table,” she said.</p><p>In a research note dated Monday, analysts at J.P. Morgan wrote that “OPEC+ is not immune to the impacts of underinvestment analyzed over the past 18 months. They estimate the “true” OPEC spare capacity in 2022 to be roughly 2 million barrels per day, which is 43% below the consensus estimate of 4.8 million barrels per day.</p><p>Incorporating that model of OPEC+ true capacity, J.P. Morgan analysts expect Brent oil to “overshoot” to $125 a barrel in 2022 and $150 a barrel in 2023.</p><p>As for omicron, some health experts in South Africa have reportedly said the new variant seems to only cause mild symptoms, though much more data are still needed. But countries have been rolling out restrictions, with Israel and Japan shutting their borders completely to foreign visitors, as more cases pop in Europe and elsewhere.</p><p>Read:More omicron cases pop up as world scrambles to learn more about latest COVID strain</p><p>Meanwhile, negotiations to restore the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal began on Monday, according to a tweet from Russian ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov.</p><p>Elsewhere across the energy space, December gasoline&#xa0;RBZ21 rose 4.4% to $2.119 a gallon, after sinking 12.5% on Friday. December heating oil&#xa0;HOZ21 climbed 4.4% to $2.186 a gallon, after dropping 12.1% Friday.</p><p>January natural gas NGF22NG00 slid 11.2% to $4.863 per million British thermal units, after a more than 7% climb on Friday.</p>",
