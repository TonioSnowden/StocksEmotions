  "text": "<p>   AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate advanced a bill imposing stricter voting rules Tuesday, a day after their Democratic counterparts in the state House left the state to prevent the bill's final passage. </p><p>   Dozens of House Democrats have vowed to stay in Washington, D.C., until the special legislative session ends Aug. 7 in order to kill the bill, which must pass both chambers. The House can't approve legislation without a two-thirds quorum of its 150 members. The remaining House members voted 76-4 Tuesday morning to send law enforcement to find absent Democrats and return them, \"under warrant of arrest, if necessary.\" </p><p>   Some Democratic senators were also absent Tuesday, but the body had enough members to conduct business and voted 18-4, along party lines, to pass the bill in its chamber. </p><p>   Both chambers of the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, in a special session that began last week, filed similar versions of the bill, which would broadly tighten voting rules across the state. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, called the special session after Democratic House members walked out before a voting deadline at the end of the regular legislative session in May, denying the body a quorum needed to vote on the proposed legislation. </p><p>   The bill advanced by the Senate would limit early voting hours, place additional restrictions on assisting disabled voters and voting by mail, and make many election missteps a felony offense. Republicans on the Senate floor Tuesday said the bill was misunderstood and had been mischaracterized, noting that it also allows voters time off work to vote and a way to challenge a mail-in ballot rejection. </p><p>   \"Easy to vote, hard to cheat sums up the bill,\" said its sponsor, Sen. Bryan Hughes. </p><p>   Democrats lodged particular concern about provisions requiring that poll watchers have free movement within polling locations. Civil-rights advocates have feared the provision may allow poll watchers to intimidate voters or infringe on their ability to vote. They also objected to the additional requirements placed on elderly and disabled voters. </p><p>   \"How can we in good conscience approve legislation when persons with disabilities tell us it makes it hard for them to vote?\" said Sen. Judith Zaffirini. \"If one case of voter fraud is too many, than one vote suppressed by this bill is also too many.\" </p><p>   The vote came after dozens of House Democrats on Monday boarded chartered planes bound for Washington, D.C., where they are drawing national support for their fight against the bills. The legislators will have to remain out of the state for weeks to successfully run out the clock on the 30-day special session. </p><p>   State Rep. Chris Turner, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a news conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday that at least 57 of 67 Democrats in the chamber had formally asked for their voting machines to be locked. </p><p>   In the House, 80 members who came Tuesday morning voted to approve a procedural move to record who is present, ban members from leaving the chamber without approval and call for law enforcement to track down absentee lawmakers -- arresting them if necessary and forcing them to return to the chamber. A total 63 of the body's 67 Democrats were gone, two of them with approved absences. </p><p>   The vote to arrest members is one of the few actions the House is allowed to take with just the members present, not a quorum of the full body. Such arrests wouldn't come with a criminal penalty, but law enforcement could forcibly return members to the chamber and lock them there until House business concludes. However, House members acknowledged that Texas law enforcement has no authority to do that outside of the state. </p><p>   Rep. Matt Shaheen, a North Texas Republican, said Monday night that he and his colleagues would look at all options for getting Democrats to return to Austin. He acknowledged it was unlikely that out-of-state law enforcement would be willing and able to make them comply with the state's legislative rules. </p><p>   \"Public pressure is going to get them to return to Texas -- I don't think it will come to them being handcuffed,\" Mr. Shaheen said. </p><p>   The special session was also going to consider funding border security measures, banning the delivery of abortion pills and prohibiting transgender students from competing in university sports in their non-birth gender. </p><p>   While Texas Democrats have promised to stay in Washington until the end of the special session on Aug. 7, Mr. Abbott could continue to call special sessions to pass the voting bill. Democrats acknowledged Tuesday that the only long-term solution was federal legislation. </p><p>   \"We can't stay here indefinitely,\" said state Rep. Rhetta Bowers, a North Texas Democrat. \"Texas Democrats will use everything in our power to fight back. But we need Congress to act now.\" </p><p>   The Texas Democrats will meet with U.S. Democratic senators in Congress to push for a federal voting bill. Vice President Kamala Harris also plans to meet with the Texas lawmakers, a White House official said. </p><p></p>",
