  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will require employees and visitors entering its offices to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 starting Sept. 7.</p><p>In a memo to employees Tuesday, the Wall Street firm said it was also instituting a mask requirement for all common areas starting Wednesday. Vaccinations are available at many of the company's on-site health centers, Goldman said, and employees get a half-day of paid time off for each dose. Employees who aren't fully vaccinated by Sept. 7 must work from home, the memo said.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE.</p><p>President Joe Biden, in response, urged private-sector employers to make vaccines mandatory. \"I call on you to do thatâ€”require it,\" he said.</p><p>In July, Morgan Stanley began requiring employees and visitors to confirm their vaccination status to enter its offices in New York City and nearby Westchester County. (Unvaccinated employees must work remotely.) Citigroup is also requiring employees returning to its offices next month to be vaccinated.</p><p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank and one of New York City's biggest employers, hasn't made vaccines mandatory but does ask employees their vaccination status. The bank earlier this month reinstituted a mask mandate in its U.S. offices, regardless of vaccination status.</p><p>Goldman Requires Vaccines for Employees, Visitors Entering Its Offices</p>",
