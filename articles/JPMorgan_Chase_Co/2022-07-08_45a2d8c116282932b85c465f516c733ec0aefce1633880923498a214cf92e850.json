  "title": "Fertilizer Stocks Come Back to Earth --- Shares of companies like Mosaic and CF Industries have had a rough second quarter",
  "text": "<p>Investors and analysts are trying to decide now whether fertilizer stocks got swept up in the broad market selloff and could reverse course, or if they were bid up too high in the panic after Russia invaded Ukraine and have farther to fall.</p><p>\"I'd be real careful with the fertilizer stocks right now,\" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management. He said he recently profited by trading intraday moves of Mosaic shares but is now steering clear of the stock and those of the Tampa, Fla., company's rivals, which he describes as being in \"no man's land.\"</p><p>In mid-April, Mosaic and CF were up 99% and 55% for the year, respectively. Though they have tumbled since, they remain among the better performers in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Mosaic has added 13%, and CF has gained 18% in 2022, compared with a 19% decline in the broader stock index.</p><p>Competitors Nutrien Ltd., Corteva Inc. and CVR Partners LP have traded in similar arcs.</p><p>Fertilizer prices and shares of producers shot up when economies reopened in 2020. Bad growing weather reduced grain inventories around the world, lifting prices of staples like corn and wheat, while high natural-gas prices and shortages of other chemicals used in fertilizer production hurt output.</p><p>Crop and fertilizer prices got another jolt in late February when Russia invaded Ukraine, putting at risk big portions of the world's grain exports and fertilizer output.</p><p>Guillaume Daguerre, director of natural resources and commodities at Fitch Ratings, said that despite benefiting from higher crop prices, fertilizer became too expensive for many farmersto buy all they wanted.</p><p>Higher prices for fertilizer tend to hurt farmers and push up food prices, which have already increased rapidly.</p><p>Crop prices have since eased, thanks partly to better growing weather in North America, Europe and Asia that has raised hopes that big crop yields can replace the staples that are stranded in Ukraine.</p><p>Corn, wheat and soybean futures are all trading lower than they were just before Russia attacked. Meanwhile, stock investors have been selling off even their winners since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to tame inflation.</p><p>Some analysts and investors say there are still reasons to be bullish on fertilizer stocks.</p><p>War in Europe is still raging, and the output of both combatants remains in doubt. Natural-gas prices are still sky-high in Europe, keeping pressure on fertilizer manufacturing costs and giving a leg up to companies that are less affected. The number of acres planted for cash crops has been on the rise, indicating demand from farmers eager to grow as much as possible at lower but still profitable crop prices.</p><p>Supplies of grains and fertilizer are low around the world and energy prices are high, which should keep food and fertilizer prices inflated through 2023, said Tracey Allen, commodity strategist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>\"Fertilizer prices are going to be a very important driver of agricultural prices going forward,\" she said.</p><p>---</p><p>Ryan Dezember contributed to this article.</p>",
