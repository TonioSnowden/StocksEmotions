  "title": "Citigroup Targets Wealthy Clients in Asia --- Goal is to raise assets under management in area to $450 billion as it cuts retail banking",
  "text": "<p>That represents a 50% increase from the roughly $300 billion that Citigroup currently manages for wealthy people in Asia. Achieving the new target won't be easy. Citigroup's assets under management for such clients grew by just 18% from $255 billion in 2015. Other global banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and HSBC Holdings PLC, are also trying to get a bigger share of the same market, particularly in China.</p><p>\"It's a very bold move, a decisive move and a difficult move,\" Mr. Babej said in an interview Friday. The 57-year-old longtime investment banker, who started running Citigroup's Asia operations in October 2019, oversees a region that is the bank's largest revenue and profit contributor outside of North America.</p><p>The third-largest U.S. bank by assets has long been the only American company with a sizable retail banking network across Asia. Citigroup also has a full-fledged institutional business that ranges from investment banking and corporate lending to treasury and trade solutions. Each quarter, the bank's Asian network handles transactions totaling about $30 trillion, according to Mr. Babej.</p><p>Last week, Citigroup said it would exit from its consumer franchises in 13 overseas markets, 10 of which are in Asia. They include mainland China -- where the bank has had branches since 2007 -- India, South Korea and Australia. That means Citigroup will divest itself of most of its 223 branches and 17.2 million individual accounts across Asia.</p><p>\"There's some areas where, increasingly, you just need so much scale and you can't play in all of them,\" Mr. Babej said.</p><p>Citigroup will maintain consumer-banking operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, London and the United Arab Emirates, the bank's wealth hubs. Mr. Babej declined to detail how the company intends to exit from its consumer operations in the other markets, saying the bank sees no need to do a fire sale of those assets.</p><p>\"We've got enormous value in these franchises and great demand from other parties,\" Mr. Babej added.</p><p>The strategy shift is one of the first big changes under Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who took the top job at the company last month. In January, the bank said it would combine its private bank that targeted ultrarich individuals with more than $25 million in assets and a wealth-management business for individuals with up to $10 million in assets. The two were previously run separately, and the combination would also enable Citigroup to cater to clients that fall in between the two groups.</p><p>\"You've got to pick your spots and really focus on the things where you have unique advantages,\" Mr. Babej said. \"Asia has the biggest growth potential across the world. For the firm, it's critical to get Asia right.\"</p><p>The region has a disproportionately high percentage of the world's ultrawealthy individuals and is benefiting from an expanding middle class and rising affluence, thanks to faster-growing economies and the emergence of numerous startups whose valuations have multiplied quickly.</p><p>Half of the world's unicorns, or private companies valued at more than $1 billion, are in Asia, according to the Hurun Research Institute.</p><p>By doubling down on wealth management, Mr. Babej hopes it could yield the bank more institutional clients, too, and \"change the entire client relationship from a more transactional one to a lifetime partnership-type relationship,\" he said.</p><p>Asia accounted for 18% of Citigroup's global operating income from institutional clients in the first quarter, thanks in part to stock and bond offerings that its investment bank arranged for many Chinese companies that raised funds offshore. At times in the past, Asia's contribution has topped North America's.</p><p>As of Friday, Citigroup, alongside other international and regional banks, raised close to $100 billion for clients in Asia in stock and bond sales this year, up 25% from a year earlier</p>",
