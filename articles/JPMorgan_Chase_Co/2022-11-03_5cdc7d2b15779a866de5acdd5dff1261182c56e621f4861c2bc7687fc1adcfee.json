  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> The world is on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst financial crisis since the second world war, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/f3bb0f96-1816-4481-8318-4f7583326a4a\">according to Elliott Management</a>, one of the world's biggest and most influential hedge funds.</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter:</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Hong Kong's quasi comeback</p></li>  <li><p>Glencore comes to Britishvolt's rescue</p></li>  <li><p>Apollo cashes in on the gilts crisis</p></li> </ul> <h1>Hong Kong's anticlimactic reopening</h1> <p>“We're back!” Hong Kong's financial secretary <strong>Paul Chan</strong> told a conference meant to celebrate the city's triumphant return to business as usual.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ff1f4ad-6180-49ea-861c-52960784e4f4\">things weren't as they appeared</a>. After catching Covid-19 on a work trip, he was stranded in Saudi Arabia owing to Hong Kong's remaining pandemic restrictions and appeared at the fintech gathering on Monday via video.</p> <p>It was a fitting emblem of the pandemic purgatory Hong Kong has found itself in since lifting restrictions such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1ca5e9f-a544-43d0-aad1-48fceb4a0f73\">weeks-long quarantines</a> and flight bans that have stifled the city since Covid-19 first struck.</p> <p>This week the city's leaders planned a series of conferences to convince investors that Hong Kong is back open, after the quarantine sparked an exodus and drove its economy back into recession.</p> <p>The problem is Hong Kong hasn't lifted all its restrictions: you still have to wear a mask and use a tracking app to get around. Visitors can't go to restaurants and bars for the first three days and are subject to a week of PCR tests, forced to isolate for seven days if they test positive.</p> <p>But the city handed exemptions from many of these rules to attendees, only serving to highlight the restrictions were still in place. Chan ended up attending the events in person later in the week after being classified as a “recovered case”.</p> <p>Five top financial executives pulled out with limited notice. <strong>Blackstone</strong>'s <strong>Jonathan Gray </strong>and <strong>Citigroup </strong>chief <strong>Jane Fraser </strong>could no longer attend because of coronavirus infections, <strong>Barclays</strong> boss <strong>CS Venkatakrishnan</strong> “made changes to his travel plans”, while <strong>Capital Group</strong> chair <strong>Timothy Armour</strong> didn't show due to Covid-like symptoms. </p> <p>Executives told the FT that it was hard to convince their bosses to travel to Hong Kong, with the possibility of isolation still looming. </p> <p>On stage the comments were fairly tame, but <strong>UBS </strong>chair <strong>Colm Kelleher </strong>raised eyebrows when he joked that “we're not reading the American press, we actually buy the [China] story”. The comment came after a senior Chinese regulator said global investors had misread China's intentions and should stop reading the international media. </p> <p>All this comes after <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa7b9d68-7c73-4287-8ca7-78c8ddc8dc72\">power grab</a> sparked a sharp sell-off of Chinese stocks, raising serious questions about the future direction of the world's second-largest economy. </p> <h1>The mystery source behind Britishvolt's 11th-hour bailout</h1> <p>White knights come in all forms. </p> <p>So <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cd57531-1c54-4d32-955c-d185dcea0621\"><strong>Britishvolt</strong></a>, which on Monday morning was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adf3ee60-4734-4e0c-b27b-55842136d3f7\">teetering on the brink of bankruptcy</a>, is likely feeling grateful for the emergency funding that will breathe another five weeks of life into the battery start-up. </p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/402a65a7-a722-4056-b2a9-167536c0418c\">secured £5mn in assistance</a>, giving it a window in which to find longer-term funding from either a strategic investor or a traditional backer, the FT's Peter Campbell, Harry Dempsey and Michael O'Dwyer report.</p> <p>The deal on Wednesday capped a tumultuous 48 hours for the business, which found out on Monday that <strong>Grant Shapps</strong> — who took over as the UK's business secretary the previous Tuesday — had turned down its request for an advance on its £100mn government support. </p> <p>As its cash reverses ran lower and lower, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f1aac20-0453-472c-b110-dacadb418508\">Ferris wheel of ministerial positions</a> in the past two months further complicated its efforts to flag the severity of the situation to whichever politician was in office.</p> <p>On top of that, at least one major would-be investor pulled support for the business, citing UK political turmoil. </p> <p>Britishvolt's initially unnamed short-term saviour requested anonymity as a condition of extending financing to the company. </p> <p>It soon transpired, however, that the mystery benefactor was<strong> Glencore</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f279e6d4-dcff-414b-a7f3-25331d0f8971\">which was having an otherwise busy day</a> in a UK court, where prosecutors said its officials flew cash on private jets to bribe officials in Africa.</p> <p>The commodities giant was one of the first serious players to back the start-up in 2021. In addition to protecting its initial investment, Glencore could be trying to keep the company solvent enough to put together a longer-term deal to take control of the company.</p> <p>Britishvolt has assets worth protecting, including its world-class site at Blyth — which has already generated interest from other would-be owners — and its in-house technology, which was shipped to carmakers earlier in the year. </p> <p>But the business needs £200mn to run until next summer — when it believes significant orders from carmakers will begin to land — and billions to realise its dream. </p> <h1>How Apollo cleaned up on the LDI crisis</h1> <p>When there's blood in the streets,<strong> Apollo</strong> <strong>Global</strong> is buying. It's one of the takeaways of the recent pension fund crisis in the UK stemming from the disastrous “mini” Budget.</p> <p>UK pension funds, facing margin calls on derivatives linked to gilts, sold about $3bn of highly rated collateralised loan obligations — diversified pools of corporate loans — to quickly raise cash. Apollo was the major buyer.</p> <p>The US private equity group's <strong>Athene</strong> annuities unit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87cb4ae6-df3b-46ca-b57f-06855cffa9f0\">snapped up $1.1bn of assets</a> during the fire sale, or about a third of the high-rated CLOs sold by the pension funds, DD's Antoine Gara and Sujeet Indap and the FT's Harriet Agnew and Josephine Cumbo report.</p> <p>“[They] happened to be the most liquid asset that those entities had to liquidate in order to cover their leverage and margin issues,” said <strong>Scott</strong> <strong>Kleinman</strong>, co-president of Apollo, on an earnings call. </p> <p>The FT has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93e3cd70-ee96-44d1-861d-a01e066b34a5\">covered the technicalities</a> of the pension crisis in the UK, including a detailed look at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0382680a-6081-4ad0-af2d-52c3c7c105a6\">outsized exposures</a> some lenders like <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> had. </p> <p>But the ability to capitalise on the situation has come from an under-appreciated part of Apollo, the $523bn in assets investment giant.</p> <p>Athene, which manages annuities on behalf of retirement policyholders, has become one of the engines of growth inside of Apollo, best known on Wall Street for its mega-sized corporate buyouts. </p> <p>The unit, which took in $13bn in new assets last quarter, has a lower return hurdle than most of Apollo's other strategies, making it a good home for high-rated assets put up for sale during a cash crunch.</p> <p>The effective yield on the CLO tranches Apollo bought was 8 per cent, too low for opportunistic debt investors, according to sources who spoke to the FT, but a coup for Athene's policyholders.</p> <p>Chief executive <strong>Marc</strong> <strong>Rowan</strong> indicated that as the era of low rates, rising leverage and upward markets now unwinds, more cracks will appear that cause more fire sales of assets to be consumed by Athene.</p> <p>The LDI crisis was “the first, I believe, of many market hiccups”, Rowan said.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Exor</strong>, the holding company controlled by Italy's billionaire <strong>Agnelli </strong>family, has promoted <strong>Suzanne Heywood</strong> to chief operating officer and named <strong>Enrico Vellano</strong> as chief executive of its alternative investment platform<strong> Lingotto</strong>. It also named <strong>Heineken </strong>executive <strong>Guido De Boer </strong>as chief financial officer, succeeding Vellano.</p></li>  <li><p>Chicago private equity firm<strong> GTCR</strong> has promoted <strong>Luke Marker</strong>,<strong> Stephen Master</strong>, and <strong>KJ McConnell </strong>from managing director to principal. The firm also hired<strong> Ashwin Krishnan </strong>as a principal from <strong>Advent International</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ares Management</strong> has hired <strong>Mark Serocold</strong> as a partner and head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa for its wealth management solutions platform, based in London. He was previously a managing director at<strong> Blackstone</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Faux-flatiron </strong>Consumers have grown to expect higher prices for their groceries and other necessities as inflation has surged over the past few years. But some corporations <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/business/food-prices-profits.html\">are still raising prices</a> even as their inflation-related costs have been covered, The New York Times reports.</p> <p><strong>Credit Saudi </strong>The Saudi National Bank's investment in Credit Suisse <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/saudi-credit-suisse-deal-is-fair-buffett-imitation-2022-11-02/\">echoes Warren Buffett's 2008 deal</a> with Goldman Sachs, Reuters Breakingviews writes.
