  "text": "<p>A short-term bounce might be possible given how cheap the market looks now. But without some ebbing of those headwinds, it is hard to make a case for a rebound. The Hang Seng Index lost 10% so far this week, its biggest two-day decline since 2008. The benchmark is at its lowest level in six years. Technology stocks fared even worse: The Kraneshares CSI China Internet exchange-traded fund, which tracks offshore-listed Chinese tech stocks, is down nearly 30% since Thursday.</p><p>China's worsening Omicron variant woes might be a major factor. The nation on Tuesday reported more than 5,000 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, its highest total since the initial outbreak in Wuhan. The resurgence led to lockdowns in many cities, including the tech and manufacturing hub of Shenzhen. That poses risks to China's anemic recovery in consumption. And the new, stringent measures dashed hopes that China might relax its zero-Covid strategy soon. Reopening plays like Macau casino operators are among the biggest losers. Morgan Stanley cut its China growth forecast for the first quarter to 3.9%, from 4.5%.</p><p>Weakening consumer sentiment is bad for China's housing market, which is deep in the doldrums. Shares of Chinese developers plunged: China Evergrande is down 21% this week while Country Garden dropped nearly 28%.</p><p>Another concern is that China could be dragged into the fracas triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Investors, particularly foreign ones, might be starting to worry that its companies could get caught in the West's sanctions, too.</p><p>Regulatory risks -- from the U.S. and China -- are hitting the market. The fear that hundreds of U.S.-listed Chinese companies might soon be delisted sparked a selloff last week. While many of these stocks have or will probably obtain another listing in Hong Kong, U.S. investors might dump them from their portfolios, especially considering the geopolitical risks. J.P. Morgan analysts downgraded China internet stocks Monday because they believe global investors will reduce their exposure. Chinese domestic shares also fell, but to a lesser extent than offshore-listed stocks, hinting at heavier selling by foreign investors.</p><p>The regulatory storm buffeting Chinese tech stocks hasn't cleared yet either. Tencent might face a record fine for anti-money-laundering violations by its mobile payment network.</p><p>The market is very cheap by historical standards: The Hang Seng is trading at 7.4 times the next 12 month's expected earnings, the lowest in 10 years, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Similarly, tech giants Alibaba and Tencent are trading at the lowest earnings multiples of the past decade. That might draw some bargain hunters in. But one big question is whether those low multiples are based on too-optimistic earnings forecasts given how much the business environment in China has changed.</p><p>Dead cats, as everyone knows, do bounce -- particularly ones that have lost as much weight recently as the Hang Seng. That isn't necessarily a good reason to climb aboard.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
