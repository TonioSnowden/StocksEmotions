  "text": "<p><em>The writer was a minister from 2010-2015</em> </p> <p>Whitehall has been awash with rumours all week. The civil service graduate entry scheme — known as the “fast stream”, a training ground for future top-ranking government officials — is under threat. Initially, job offers were to be rescinded from recruits starting this autumn. After a fightback by some ministers and senior civil servants, the scheme will now “pause” recruitment for the 2023 intake.</p> <p>The campaign to shake up the civil service, and slash around <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d1ba055-167a-4ddd-ba9c-1505535dd890\">90,000 posts</a> by 2025, is led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose ministerial title includes “government efficiency”, and by Steven Barclay, the prime minister's chief of staff. It is not entirely clear whether the motivation is to save money or bash a civil service they see as obstructive. No doubt they concluded that the obvious and least painful first step in cutting headcount is to halt recruitment. Isn't this, ministers might ask, simply what any well-run business would do?</p> <p>But cutting off the intake of able new graduates is precisely what any high-quality business does not do. Even in hard times, the best employers make sure that they are investing in future talent and leadership.</p> <p>I have my own experience of how to do it right — and wrong. After university, I secured a place at JPMorgan, turning down a number of higher-paying roles at prestigious but cut-throat US investment houses. In September 1987, I left for New York and the six-month graduate training course at Morgan's world headquarters at 23 Wall Street.</p> <p>The world economy was booming and there was every prospect of plum jobs on our return for the 120 or so of us on “Morgan Finance Programme Number 5”. And then on Black Monday, October 19, the Dow plunged by 22.6 per cent, the largest one-day percentage drop in the index's history. Stock markets around the world followed suit.</p> <p>We trainees were in upstate New York, on one of the team-building experiences the Americans loved (they were hated by the more reserved Brits). We heard about the market chaos, but in the middle of nowhere we had no phones or televisions.</p> <p>I ended the day in my wooden hut, out in the wilderness, transfixed by the radio of the person in the next bed as the grim announcer gave out the seemingly endless, bleak news of the day's share price action, stock by stock, fall by fall.</p> <p>When we returned to Manhattan, those high-paying but ruthless US investment banks were responding quickly. With a hardheadedness that Rees-Mogg would doubtless commend, they instantly laid off all graduate trainees — the highest-paid new recruits were suddenly unemployed.</p> <p>Would we be next? We were told to attend a meeting in the main lecture hall at headquarters, to be addressed by Dennis Weatherstone himself, president of JPMorgan and one of the world's most famous bankers. The omens were not good.</p> <p>But when we gathered nervously together one early morning, the message that Weatherstone delivered was not what we feared. Yes, the world economy was in a mess. Yes, there would be a hit to the bank's earnings. Yes, the bank would need to tighten its belt. But, no, we would not be sacked. We were the future of the bank, recruited for the long term. The exciting jobs we had hoped to occupy on our return home — trading complex derivatives or selling securities — might not be available. But the bank would find homes for us. </p> <p>He was true to his word. I returned to London to join a low-prestige department of JPMorgan Securities Limited. Unexciting, but a job. After a few months of obscurity, “MFP5” graduates found themselves in increasingly interesting posts, and many went on to become the profit-makers of the future.</p> <p>There are lessons here for UK ministers. Turning away the brightest graduates is good short-term public sector cost control but very bad long-term policy. The supply of future leaders is blocked. And if ministers axe this programme, it will be more difficult to find the right individuals in the future: they must expect to pay higher salaries and spend more on recruitment.</p> <p>Even “pausing” the fast stream programme is a bad idea if ministers want to upgrade or “reform” Whitehall. The new talents and skills they seek will be harder to come by. Damage to the scheme's reputation will have a long-term impact on the quality of policy and delivery across the public services. And the irony is that we will probably end up utilising the same people anyway — but on secondment from a management consultancy, with the public paying twice as much for their services.</p> <p>If ministers think that scrapping the recruitment of top graduates is the business-savvy thing to do, they should look back to 1987. JPMorgan has thrived and remains one of the most successful businesses in the world. The companies that brutally laid off their graduate entrants after Black Monday mostly no longer exist — their once well-known names consigned to history.</p><p>Source: David Laws 2022 'Rejecting top graduates is no way to run a government — or a business' FT.com 3 June.
