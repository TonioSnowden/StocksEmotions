Unsurprisingly, a lawsuit followed soon after.</p> <p>What did come as a surprise was the outcome. Because the parties that clung to the cash had no reason to believe that the payment was a mistake, a New York federal judge ruled last year, they did not have to pay up after the fact.</p> <p>Citi swiftly filed an appeal and is now anxiously awaiting a decision.</p> <p>The fiasco <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97175f3e-29ae-4dce-9ea8-41cbdaccd947\">has exposed cracks</a> in Revlon's foundation, too, as DD's Sujeet Indap reports. The make-up manufacturer filed for bankruptcy last week amid a brutal cash crunch. </p> <p>One reason Revlon has yet to strike a settlement with creditors is because, until the Citi snafu is sorted out, it can't be sure exactly who its creditors are.</p> <p>“What's tricky with the Revlon bankruptcy is that you have to figure out not only how to split the pie — which is the typical issue — but also how big the pie is and who actually owns the slices,” said <strong>Duke University</strong> law professor <strong>Elisabeth de Fontenay</strong>.</p> <p>If the lower court ruling is reversed, then those who kept the $500mn will give back the cash and become Revlon claimants. (They were paid off at 100 cents on the dollar while that loan is trading now at distressed levels.)</p> <p>But if the lower court ruling is upheld, Citi has asserted so-called “subrogation” rights, meaning that — in an intriguing twist — it will attempt to become a creditor of Revlon.</p> <p>The bank has long been by the side of Revlon tycoon <strong>Ronald Perelman</strong>, but could face off against him and other Revlon stakeholders in bankruptcy court should things get uglier.</p> <h1>Frowns abound in ‘the happiest place on Earth'</h1> <p><strong>Disney's</strong> multibillion-dollar bubble promises visitors respite from the harsh realities pervading just outside the magical gates of its Orlando theme park.</p> <p>But the mystical divide shielding the so-called “happiest place on earth” has begun to slip as it faces its largest reputational crisis to date.</p> <p>The political controversy swirling Disney since its home state proposed a controversial law earlier this year to restrict discussion of sexual or gender identity in primary schools is nothing new. </p> <p>Disney has been subject to criticism from conservatives since it became one of the first US companies to offer healthcare benefits to the same-sex partners of its employees in 1995.</p> <p>What's different this time, as the FT's Christopher Grimes reports <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4e84eac-8502-4a7f-b51b-c372752b4b38\">in this Big Read</a>, is that the company's leadership, by its own public relations missteps, have essentially poured gasoline on an objectively extinguishable fire.</p> <p>“In a short period of time they managed to piss off both the left and the right,” says a former senior Disney executive. </p> <p>The saga began when<strong> Geoff Morrell</strong>, who lasted just three months on the job as Disney's former head of corporate affairs, shut down calls to sign a public letter condemning the controversial bill and pushed instead for the company's lobbyists to chip away at the proposed legislation in Florida's capital of Tallahassee.</p> <p>The failure to publicly condemn the bill angered Disney's LGBT+ staff. But when CEO <strong>Bob Chapek</strong> vowed to repeal the law and rethink Disney's campaign contributions in Florida, he made a new enemy: the state's Republican governor <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>. </p> <p>The governor has signed legislation to strip Disney's special tax status that allows it to govern the area around its Florida park, and is using the fight with Disney to raise campaign cash. (He has raised $50mn this year.)</p> <p>Disney's fallout with Republicans suggests that the party once known for its unfaltering support of corporate America now comes armed with conditions. Chapek's recent announcement that the group will suspend political donations in Florida altogether will do little to bridge the gap.</p> <p>Morrell's replacement <strong>Kristina Schake </strong>is well versed in facing off against the Republican PR machine after heading up communications for <strong>Michelle Obama </strong>and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>. Placating Disney's embittered staff is a whole other challenge.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bruce Buck</strong>, the former<strong> Skadden Arps</strong> lawyer and one of<strong> Roman Abramovich</strong>'s closest confidants, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea1b4dbe-9582-4514-a0b5-d6187fbde39a\">is stepping down</a> as chair of <strong>Chelsea Football Club </strong>following the £2.5bn sale of the<strong> Premier League</strong> side. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Santander</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83a4e0d9-1fcf-4cb1-b7f5-ebc23dbc4cbb\">has named</a> <strong>Héctor Grisi</strong> its next chief executive, promoting one of its top regional executives to work alongside executive chair <strong>Ana Botín</strong> and drawing a line under the failed appointment of <strong>Andrea Orcel</strong> more than three years ago. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> has hired <strong>Jasper Reiser</strong> and <strong>Dimitri Reading-Picopoulos</strong> as managing directors in its UK investment banking business.
