  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Canadian Firm to  Fully Own China  Fund Manager  ----  By Rebecca Feng",
  "text": "<p>   China's securities regulator has given Manulife Investment Management approval to take full ownership of its local fund-management arm, a first in a country that is slowly opening up its $3.7 trillion mutual-fund market. </p><p>   The Canadian-owned firm will become the first foreign fund manager to convert a local joint venture into a fully owned entity. It applied for full ownership after a rule change in April 2020 that scrapped a previous 51% cap for foreign shareholders. </p><p>   Manulife isn't the first foreign firm to get approval for a fully owned local mutual-fund manager. BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity International have both been granted permission to do so -- but neither firm previously ran a mutual-fund company with a local partner. </p><p>   The approval is part of the wider opening up of China's financial market, which previously forced foreign firms to operate using joint ventures. Foreign banks, securities houses, and credit-rating firms no longer need local partners. </p><p>   JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley have both applied for approval to increase their ownership in their own Chinese fund-management entities. Other foreign firms including Neuberger Berman and VanEck have either set up, or are seeking approval to set up, their own mutual funds in China. </p><p>   Manulife Investment Management, the global wealth and asset management arm of Manulife Financial Corp., previously held a 49% stake in a fund manager it owned with the state-owned Tianjin TEDA International Holding. </p><p>   The two companies have been in talks about a deal for two years, said Michael Dommermuth, Asia head of wealth and asset management at Manulife Investment Management. Mr. Dommermuth said the joint venture had around $12 billion assets under management in China by June. </p><p>   In August, the Chinese securities watchdog asked Manulife to explain how it would manage cross-border data flows when it gets full approval. China's internet regulator tightened rules on cross-border data transfer in July. According to the new rules, which kicked in on Sept. 1, companies processing data for key industries including finance must pass a security review by the Cyberspace Administration of China before they can transfer personal data abroad. </p><p>    Xu Jin will become chairwoman of the China business, Manulife said. Ms. Jin was most recently vice chair and chief executive officer of China Merchants Fund Management Co., the fund house under China Merchants Bank. She previously worked at the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission. </p><p></p>",
