On Tuesday, the Dow closed above 36000 for the first time.</p><p>The Federal Reserve concluded its two-day meeting and announced plans to end its bond-buying program but keep rates unchanged. Mr. Powell put greater emphasis on the uncertainty facing the outlook for inflation and the Fed's statement described high inflation as \"largely reflecting transitory factors.\"</p><p>Investors were prepared for the Fed to start dialing back its bond purchases and were closely focused on how the Fed approached rising prices.</p><p>\"It was more dovish than markets expected,\" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, of the Fed meeting. \"Anytime there's a whiff of lower rates, we tend to get favorable market reactions.\"</p><p>Major indexes have been steadily rising in recent weeks and some investors said that they expect the ascent to continue through the end of the year, continuing a rally that has been fueled by low interest rates over the past year.</p><p>\"Earning season has been very strong and the beats have been extremely robust,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Despite the fact that there have been lots of concerns about price pressures and supply bottlenecks, there is no sign that any of that is going through into margins.\"</p><p>Though the broader market was calm, companies popular with traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets recorded big swings while options activity heated up. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond surged around 20%.

Ride-hailing firm Lyft jumped roughly 8% after saying revenue climbed in the latest quarter as demand for its services returned.</p><p>Avis Budget Group fell over 15% following its more than 100% gain Tuesday, which came after the company reported better-than-expected profit and announced plans to add more electric vehicles to its rental fleet.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell around 3% to $82.09 a barrel. Gold prices weakened around 1.2%.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 added roughly 0.4%.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.577%, up from 1.546% on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mostly lower.
