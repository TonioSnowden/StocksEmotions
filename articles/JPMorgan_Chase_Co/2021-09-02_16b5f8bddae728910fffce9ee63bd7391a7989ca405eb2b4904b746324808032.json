  "text": "<p>Baxter International, the medical technology group, has agreed to buy rival equipment company Hillrom for $12.4bn, including debt, the latest in a series of megadeals in the medical devices and healthcare industry.</p> <p>Hillrom shareholders will receive $156 a share in cash, a 26 per cent premium to the company's closing stock price on July 27, when Bloomberg News first reported that an initial takeover approach from Baxter had been rebuffed. </p> <p>The Chicago-based company had originally rejected a $144 a share offer from earlier this year, said a person briefed about the matter.</p> <p>Healthcare and pharmaceutical mergers and acquisitions have more than doubled in 2021 compared with a year ago, when the sector was badly hit by the effects of the pandemic. Since the start of the year, about $570bn worth of deals have been agreed, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.</p> <p>M&amp;A in the medical devices sector has been particularly active this year, with a consortium of private equity groups led by Blackstone, Carlyle and Hellman &amp; Friedman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3993dcba-4cbc-4564-a22e-8c36992589b2\">buying a majority stake</a> in Medline for about $34bn, including debt.</p> <p>Dealmaking in the sector has sped up over the past few years, including Abbott's $25bn takeover of St Jude and Medtronic's $42.9bn acquisition of Covidien, as companies seek to build scale as industry margins become thinner.</p> <p>Overall M&amp;A activity, across sectors, has also been booming since the start of the year, with nearly $4tn worth of transactions agreed so far, an all-time record and more than double the total for all of 2020.</p> <p>Companies that were forced to drop deal plans last year due to coronavirus have rushed back to the M&amp;A table in recent months, partly because many chief executives are concerned about a possible future rise in interest rates.</p> <p>Borrowing costs currently are at historic lows, which makes financing transactions cheaper than usual.</p> <p>Baxter said on Thursday that it would finance the transaction through a combination of cash and debt financing from JPMorgan Chase and Citibank. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company will have net leverage of approximately 4.2 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of the combined companies.</p> <p>The combination of Hillrom, which makes healthcare equipment varying from low-tech hospital chairs to more sophisticated wearable electrocardiographs and operating tables, and Baxter, which focuses on critical care, nutrition and surgical products, could generate $250m of annual pre-tax cost synergies by 2024.</p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan 2021 'Baxter to acquire US medical equipment group Hillrom for $12.4bn' FT.com 2 September.
