  "title": "Biden Administration Stymies Russia Debt Payments; The U.S. Treasury had previously granted special exemptions allowing the Kremlin to tap accounts at U.S. banks to repay its debts",
  "text": "<p>\"Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,\" a U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman said. \"This will further deplete the resources Putin is using to continue his war against Ukraine and will cause more uncertainty and challenges for their financial system.\"</p><p>The move to tighten the financial screws on Moscow come as the White House considers fresh sanctions on Russia in the wake of allegations that President Vladimir Putin's forces committed war crimes in Ukraine.</p><p>All avenues for Moscow to pay aren't closed and in theory it has plenty of dollars to make the payments. The Treasury spokeswoman said Russia could pay the bonds using its foreign currency reserves or tap proceeds of new revenue. She said the action applied to U.S. financial institutions.</p><p>Before it invaded Ukraine, Russia had more than $630 billion in foreign currency reserves. It continues to receive billions of dollars a week in payments under long-term energy sales contracts with customers in Europe.</p><p>Russia owed foreign investors about $2 billion for one of the bonds, which matured Monday, and another $84 million in interest payments on a second bond. Russia's National Settlement Depository website showed the Ministry of Finance ordered payment for the $2 billion bond to go through on Monday. The Treasury move effectively blocked the payment.</p><p>A missed payment for the April 4 bond won't immediately constitute a default. The bond has a 30-day grace period, giving Moscow additional time to send payment on to bondholders through other means.</p><p>Investors priced in the higher likelihood of a Russian default, said a U.S.-based fund manager. The price on Russia's 4.875% bond due in September 2023 fell by 25% Tuesday to about 36 cents on the dollar, while its 5.875% bond due in 2043 dropped 20% to roughly 27 cents on the dollar, he said.</p><p>The decision to block the payment indicates a shift in tack by Washington and contrasts with comments by a senior administration official last week, who said that the U.S. had thus far allowed debt service repayments to help avoid collateral damage from the sanctions on Western financial institutions.</p><p>Russia's markets and economy has reeled from the financial and trade embargoes, with the country's central bank taking emergency measures including a range of capital controls to prop up the ruble's value and prevent inflation from spiraling out of control. Economists at the IMF and other major international financial institutions predict a steep contraction in economic output this year.</p><p>Moscow has retaliated against Western sanctions by trying to use its own economic leverage over Europe. Last week Mr. Putin said Russia would demand payment in rubles for its gas supplies that are critical to the running of Western European economies.</p><p>Concerns over an imminent default had abated in recent weeks as Russia made payment on a dollar bond in mid-March and funds for later dollar bonds continued to reach investors' bank accounts. Previous Treasury rules allowed for investors to receive payment on Russian bonds until May 25.</p><p>Because the Treasury has previously allowed Russia to make dollar payments from its U.S. bank accounts, it created an expectation among some investors that the May 25 deadline might be delayed as well, said Kaan Nazli, a London-based bond portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group. \"They could stay current on their payments for a long time,\" he said.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. was meant to act as the correspondent bank on the bond payments, a type of go-between that allows foreign banks to process dollar transactions. The money would have then gone to Citigroup Inc., which is the bond's paying agent, charged with processing payments and sending them on to bondholders. Spokespersons from JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment.</p><p>In a previous bond payment Russia paid in March, the Treasury department had given special approvals to JPMorgan and Citigroup to process the transactions, according to a person familiar with the transaction.</p><p>The last time Russia didn't pay its bondholders was in August 1998. Falling oil prices, low tax collection and stuttering reforms led Russia to default on its local-currency denominated debt and devalue the ruble.</p><p>Matt Wirz and Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Administration Stymies Russia Debt Payments</p>",
