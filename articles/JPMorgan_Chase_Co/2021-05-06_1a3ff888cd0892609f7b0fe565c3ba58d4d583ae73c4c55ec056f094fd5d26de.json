  "title": "Chip Crunch  Threatens  Car Makers'  Profitability  ----  By Mike Colias",
  "text": "<p>   Auto makers fresh off heady sales and profits in the first quarter are preparing for a rough ride ahead, as the global computer-chip shortage clouds an otherwise ripe environment for car sales. </p><p>    General Motors Co. on Wednesday reported a near-record operating profit for the January-March period while rival Ford Motor Co. a week earlier posted its best earnings in years. Jeep-maker Stellantis NV said sales rose 14% for the quarter and confirmed earlier full-year guidance of 5.5% to 7.5% adjusted operating margins. </p><p>   But each company said the shortage of semiconductors that has forced production cuts at car factories world-wide will pinch production and inventories even more heading into the summer. That means car shoppers are likely to find slimmer options and fewer deals. </p><p>   The industry's inventory crunch has produced a favorable effect: record pricing. Dealers and car companies have been able to withhold the generous discounts and promotions they dangle to entice shoppers. </p><p>   In the first quarter, the average financial incentive on new vehicles fell 20% from a year earlier, while the average price paid hit a quarterly record of $37,314, according to research firm J.D. Power. </p><p>   Meanwhile, the economic conditions for new-vehicle demand are more favorable than they have been in years, analysts and executives say, as pandemic restrictions loosen, federal stimulus money flows and interest rates remain tame. The pace of new-vehicle sales in April hit its fastest clip in more than 15 years on a seasonally-adjusted basis, according to JPMorgan Chase. </p><p>   But with the chip shortage worsening, car makers have been cutting more factory work shifts. While auto executives see the situation improving after June, for now, it is crimping inventory and could dampen what was setting up to be a banner summer at U.S. car dealerships. \"We think Q2 will be the weakest and then we see recovery coming,\" GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told analysts on a call. </p><p>   Stellantis said the lack of semiconductors resulted in an 11% reduction in planned first-quarter production, or about 190,000 vehicles, and that the problem will force it to cut second-quarter production even more. Ford said last week that it will lose half of its planned second-quarter production. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Ford said it is adding at least two more weeks of down time or limited output at several factories. Ford also is idling its Ranger pickup plant near Detroit for the second half of May, a spokeswoman said. </p><p>   GM wouldn't quantify its production cuts, but confirmed the chip shortage will hurt more in the second quarter. </p><p>   Still, it seems clear that it is hurting Ford worse. Ford pegged the fallout for the year at about $2.5 billion, while GM estimated its impact at $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Ms. Barr said she is confident that GM can hit the high range of its original 2021 pretax profit forecast of $10 billion to $11 billion. Ford's guidance is for $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. </p><p>   GM credited its $4.4 billion pretax first-quarter profit in part to brisk sales of its redesigned large SUVs. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Nick Kostov and Nora Naughton contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
