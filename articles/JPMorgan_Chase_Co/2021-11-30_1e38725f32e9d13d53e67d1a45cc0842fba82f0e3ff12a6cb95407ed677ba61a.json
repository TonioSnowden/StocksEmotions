  "text": "<p>Nik Storonsky, chief executive of London-based digital banking app Revolut, said he hoped to secure a UK banking licence early in 2022 as he warned that liquidity remained the biggest headwind to companies listing in Britain.</p> <p>“We are getting closer, especially with the UK banking licence,” said Storonsky at the FT's Global Banking Summit. “And we are about to submit our full US banking licence application, hopefully in the first quarter.” </p> <p>Other challenger banks have had to halt their efforts to break into the US market. In October, Monzo withdrew its application after regulators said it was unlikely to be approved. </p> <p>Storonsky said that acquiring a banking licence was extremely important to Revolut to build consumer trust. “A lot of consumers trust banks rather than fintechs so the UK and US bank licence will increase trust and business metrics.”</p> <p>Revolut would be one of the most valuable companies ever to join the London Stock Exchange if it chose to follow money transfer company Wise on to the UK market. In July, a $800m fundraising gave Revolut a $33bn valuation, making it the biggest private technology company in British history. </p> <p>Storonsky said new rules had made the UK's public markets more attractive to companies but a lack of liquidity remained a disadvantage. “Obviously, if a stock market in the US is 100 times larger compared to the UK then it might be the primary reason why a lot of companies choose to list in the US.”</p> <p>The chief executive said Revolut had weathered the pandemic: while revenue fell by 40 per cent in March and April 2020, the company significantly outperformed its pre-Covid performance in terms of revenues and gross profit growth, and entered new businesses.</p> <p>“We were all thinking initially it was scary but overall it was very positive for the company,” he said.</p> <p>He also dismissed the attempts of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to compete for younger customers by offering more digital products. “They are not even in the top 50 providers,” he said.<br><br>Storonosky said he had witnessed a trend of disruption as “certain legacy banks become faster” but claimed they were “still not innovative enough” and had “decreased” their offering.<br><br>The neobank had been lucky to enter crypto products in 2017, ahead of most competitors, he said. “Now it's very popular. We will continue to invest [in crypto] because it means the more revenues and gross profits the business makes, the more it makes sense to invest and go deeper into the product.” </p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan in Chennai and Jyoti Mann and Stephen Morris in London 2021 'Revolut chief hopes for UK banking licence by start of 2022' FT.com 30 November.
