  "text": "<p>That's why it might be better to think ahead about your future income needs and start compounding your dividend investments.</p><p>In June, we listed 30 stocks that were the best dividend income growers among the S&amp;P 500 SPX. We looked back five years. A new 10-year screen of dividend compounders is below.</p><p>For an updated five-year example, consider Best Buy Co. BBY. The stock pays a quarterly dividend of 70 cents a share. Based on the closing price of $114.53 a share at the close on Oct. 20, the annual dividend yield was 2.44%. That may seem to be a modest yield, but in comparison, 10-year U.S. Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD10Y were yielding 1.65%. Bonds are considered safer investments, of course, but the interest payments on that type of bond won't increase and there's no potential for capital growth, as you have with stocks.</p><p>Here's where the Best Buy example gets interesting. If you had purchased the stock five years earlier, at the close on Oct. 20, 2016, you would have paid $39.48 a share. At that time, the quarterly dividend was 28 cents and the dividend yield was 2.84%.</p><p>If you held those shares for five years, your dividend yield, based on what you paid for them in 2016 and the current quarterly payout of 70 cents a share, would have risen to 7.09%. Meanwhile, the value of your shares (excluding dividends) would have more than tripled. And those five years went by pretty quickly, didn't they?</p><p>10-year screen of dividend compounders</p><p>The new 10-year screen was inspired by Eddy Elfenbein, who discussed Public Storage PSA in his CWS Market Review on Oct. 19.</p><p>“I really like PSA's dividend,” he wrote, explaining that the annual payout had quadrupled over the past 15 years. “Think of it this way: If you had bought PSA 15 years ago, you'd now be yielding close to 10% based on your original purchase price.”</p><p>Fifteen years is a very long time to hold a stock, so this time around we're looking back 10 years, with a screen similar to the previous five-year list. Here's the breakdown:</p><p>There were 204 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with dividend yields of at least 2.00% as of the close on Oct. 20, 2011.</p><p>Among the 204 stocks, 91 had at least tripled in price (with prices adjusted by FactSet for splits and spinoffs) for 10 years through Oct. 20, 2021. (We had limited our previous five-year dividend-compounders list to companies whose shares had at least doubled in price.)</p><p>Among the remaining 91 companies, 49 had achieved 10-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for dividends of at least 10%.</p><p>Here are the 20 stocks from the remaining list for which the dividend yield would be highest, based on current payouts and purchase prices 10 years ago:</p><p> Company                                 Dividend yield on shares purchased 10 years ago  Dividend yield – 10 years ago  Current dividend yield  10-year dividend CAGR  10-year price&#xa0; change  Total return – 10 years  Extra Space Storage Inc.
