  "title": "Why Fed's Powell speech on Friday likely matters less for stocks than a sputtering housing market",
  "text": "<p>While the speech will matter, stock-market investors should also pay heed to weaker U.S. economic data, includingfalling home prices and slumping sales that point to a sputtering housing market, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment research manager at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"It's important what he says, but we also have to keep in mind it's not a policy meeting,\" Gordon said of Powell's Friday speech, adding that Fed officials have been clear they will lean heavily on economic data when making policy decisions.</p><p>In terms of the cooling housing market, \"The upside is that it's not a repeat of the build up of the subprime lending bubble,\" he said, referring to a teetering housing market in 2007 that sparked a wave of mortgage lender bankruptcies and the set the global financial crisis in motion.</p><p>\"The downside is the negative ripple effects, and how much of a role housing plays in the wealth effect,\" Gordon said.</p><p>In terms of potential stock-market impact, he ranked inflation as a top factor to watch, followed by the labor market and housing, which has ties both to high costs of living and the jobs market.</p><p>\"It's a massive portion of the economy,\" he said of housing.</p><p>Wealth effect</p><p>Studies have shown that American households have been prone to spend more as the value of their homes increase, even though a JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. report from 2020 showed more frugal ways set in after the global financial crisis, based on a review of the bank's clients in the post-Great Recession period.</p><p>Importantly, the study preceded trillions worth of pandemic aid that has been sloshing through the economy, financial markets and housing since 2020. A reversal of the Fed's easy-money stance contributed to a historic selloff in stocks and bonds in the year's first half.</p><p>The big debate now is whether a U.S. recession already has been priced into markets. The sharp summer rally in stocks in July and early August has been largely on pause in recent sessions, even after the S&amp;P 500 index SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA on Monday booked their sharpest daily declines in about two months.</p><p>The trajectory for stocks in coming months could hinge on how restrictive borrowing rates become in terms of the U.S. economic outlook and for households, an engine of economic activity.</p><p>\"The Fed is likely to continue to hike rates a bit higher than current market expectations,\" said Brendan Murphy, head of global fixed income, North America at Insight Investment, in emailed comments.</p><p>The market has been pricing in roughly a 3.75% peak policy rate by mid-2023, from a 2.25-2.50% range currently, he said, with a \"fairly quick reversal of some of those hikes\" later in the year.</p><p>\"Our expectation is that the terminal policy rate may be higher than what is implied by the market and likely to be followed by a pause in the hiking cycle rather than a quick reversal.\"</p><p>In a reprieve for lower income households with student loans, President Biden on Wednesday announced plans tocancel $10,000 in student debtand $20,000 for Pell grant recipients.</p><p>Biden said that getting an education \"used to be a ticket to a better life\" on Wednesday, but that it became too expensive for many families.</p><p>Why Fed's Powell speech on Friday likely matters less for stocks than a sputtering housing market</p>",
