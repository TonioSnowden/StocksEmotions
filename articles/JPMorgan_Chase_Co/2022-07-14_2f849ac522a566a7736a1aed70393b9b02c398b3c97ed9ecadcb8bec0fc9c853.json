  "text": "<p>Why worry? American consumers seem to be doing just fine. According to JPMorgan Chase, which kicked off the second-quarter earnings season for Wall Street banks on Thursday, main street looks in good shape. Data from its retail and credit card businesses said as much. Markets refuse to be mollified. </p> <p>Concerns about a recession ahead has cut bank stock prices. JPMorgan has suffered more than its peers. Its stock is down over a third this year, against 28 per cent for the wider KBW Bank index. Having traded on two times book value as recently as October, it wallows at just 1.3 times, a level last seen during the pandemic.</p> <p>Retail consumers may be holding up but JPMorgan's broader results hardly inspire. Both top and bottom line figures missed expectations. While market turmoil was positive for trading desks, particularly in fixed income, investment banking revenues cratered. These fell 61 per cent as deal making and new listings dried up.</p> <p>Dig deeper and the near-30 per cent drop in net income during the quarter can be largely attributed to JPMorgan conservatively setting aside an additional $428mn against potential loan losses. Optimists will remember that these credit reserves end up getting released if loan delinquencies stay low.</p> <p>So far, American households show few signs of financial strain. JPMorgan's loan book — led by credit card and commercial lending — grew 6 per cent. It was also more profitable thanks to higher rates. Net interest income climbed nearly a fifth to $15.1bn. Delinquencies are down on last year.</p> <p>Warnings from a hawkish Federal Reserve suggest this happy state of affairs may not last. JPMorgan is suspending share buybacks to meet new capital requirements. </p> <p>The bank may not control interest rates but it does have power over its overheads. Expense guidance remained unchanged at $77bn this year. That seems odd for a company preparing for harder times for its loan book. It should consider pulling that lever harder. </p><p>Source:  2022 'JPMorgan: rebound in consumer lending fails to allay recession fears' FT.com 14 July.
