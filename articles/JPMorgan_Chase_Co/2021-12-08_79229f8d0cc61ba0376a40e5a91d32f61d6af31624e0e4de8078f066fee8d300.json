  "text": "<p>Hopes that the new Covid-19 strain will have a less-pronounced impact on travel and consumer confidence have bolstered stocks this week.</p><p>Scientists and vaccine makers are still assessing the severity of Omicron and how well existing vaccines may work against it.</p><p>The balance of the latest Omicron updates appears to indicate that another major economic shock isn't coming, which has sparked short covering and a scramble to buy after a few weeks of losses, said ThinkMarkets analyst Fawad Razaqzada. \"It's a relief rally,\" he said.</p><p>Uncertainty over Covid and Fed policy, however, may challenge the usual holiday cheer. Additionally, lower trading volumes in the lead-up to the holidays are likely to cause exaggerated moves in either direction, analysts say.</p><p>\"We're in this period where investors are grappling for any news they can find and that, coupled with low liquidity, is leading to some big moves,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>U.S. stocks were led by riskier, more growth-oriented sectors, such as technology, energy and consumer-discretionary. All 11 of the S&amp;P 500's sectors rose. Some consumer-discretionary stocks especially sensitive to Covid-19 developments, such as Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide and Royal Caribbean, fell in afternoon trading, closing lower.</p><p>Bank stocks, which have been seesawing along with the latest Omicron news, rose. Morgan Stanley jumped 3.3% to $102.50, Wells Fargo gained 3% to $50.25 and JPMorgan rose 1.5% to $162.57.</p><p>Vir Biotechnology's shares rose 12% to $42.98 after the immunology company and its partner, GlaxoSmithKline, said their Covid-19 antibody treatment proved effective against the Omicron variant in laboratory studies.</p><p>Shares of Intel gained 3.1% to $52.57 after The Wall Street Journal reported that it was planning to publicly list shares in its Mobileye self-driving-car unit, the latest move by Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger to revive the semiconductor giant's fortunes.</p><p>U.S. crude futures rose 3.7% to $72.05 a barrel, as fears of renewed Covid-19-related lockdowns recede.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.479% from 1.433% Monday. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 surged 2.5% to 480.18.
