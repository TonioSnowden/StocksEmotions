  "text": "<p>Pretax profit, adjusted for nonrecurring items, fell 8%, to about $4 billion. That amounted to $2.09 a share, better than the average analysts' forecast of $1.65, according to research firm FactSet.</p><p>The operating landscape for car companies has gotten choppier since January, when GM issued an upbeat outlook for 2022. Company executives said at the time they expected pretax income, minus one-time items, to be $13 billion to $15 billion this year, a forecast that assumed no new economic shocks or supply-chain pressures beyond lingering effects from the chip shortage. Its pretax income was $14.3 billion last year.</p><p>Inflationary pressures on auto makers and suppliers worsened in the two months since the Ukraine war began. Logistical delays, higher freight costs and rising prices for raw materials such as nickel and lithium, key ingredients for electric-vehicle battery cells, are weighing on auto makers, analysts and executives say.</p><p>Meanwhile, Covid-19 restrictions in China ratcheted up toward the end of the first quarter and continue, potentially adding stress on the auto supply chain.</p><p>GM said it continued to get a big lift from strong pricing. Dealer stocks have been so thin amid constrained computer-chip supplies that GM and other auto makers have pulled way back on financial incentives for consumers, who have been paying record sums for new vehicles.</p><p>Still, GM said higher commodity and logistics costs had more of a negative effect on the bottom line than in recent quarters, largely offsetting the effects of strong pricing. The cost of nickel, palladium and other metals have risen sharply in recent months.</p><p>Car companies are likely to pass along to consumers the added costs of those disruptions, which could erode demand for new vehicles, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a research note last month.</p><p>Continued supply-chain troubles will suppress global vehicle sales this year, said S&amp;P Global Mobility, which tracks auto-industry data. The research firm last week cut its closely watched forecast of global vehicle production for the second time since the Ukraine war began. It now expects 80.6 million vehicles to be produced this year, down about 4% from its initial forecast.</p><p>Shares fell 4.5% on Tuesday.</p><p>GM during the first quarter fared better than some rivals on keeping its plants running in North America, by far its biggest profit generator.</p><p>GM scrapped about 50,000 vehicles of planned production because of the chip shortage during the three-month period, which was roughly half the total cut by rival Ford, according to data from research firm AutoForecast Solutions.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
