  "text": "<p>Barclays surprised investors earlier this year by revealing it had mistakenly sold billions of dollars more in structured notes and other products than it had regulatory approval to issue. This week, it said the overselling totaled $17.6 billion, or $2.4 billion more than its initial estimate.</p><p>The snafu marred the first months of C.S. Venkatakrishnan's tenure as chief executive. Mr. Venkatakrishnan was appointed late last year to succeed Jes Staley, who resigned under pressure from regulators over how he characterized his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>On Thursday, Barclays said the debt-sale error had cost it about £341 million of profit in the second quarter, including the cost of a potential fine from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It also took a £200 million charge against potential credit impairments, where last year it had released some £797 million of provisions against bad loans, as the global economy recovered from the pandemic.</p><p>Separately, Barclays set aside £165 million for another expected fine from regulators including the SEC, as part of an industrywide probe into bankers' use of unapproved messaging apps. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. paid a $200 million fine in December, and several other banks have said they are also being scrutinized, or made provisions for likely penalties for the same issue.</p><p>Barclays shares have fallen 16% this year through Wednesday, underperforming the FTSE 100 stock index, which has dropped 1.1%.</p><p>Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com</p><p>Barclays Profit Nearly Halves After Fresh Hit From Debt-Sale Blunder</p>",
