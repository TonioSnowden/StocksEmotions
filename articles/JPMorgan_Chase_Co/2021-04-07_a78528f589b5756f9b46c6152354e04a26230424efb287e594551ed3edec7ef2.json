  "title": "Texas Storm Is a Windfall  For Some Wall Street Firms  ----  By Juliet Chung and Katherine Blunt",
  "text": "<p>   A handful of Wall Street firms that bet big on the power sector in recent years made millions in paper profits when the winter storm in Texas boosted demand for the electricity generated by plants they own. </p><p>   SoftBank Group Corp.'s Fortress Investment Group LLC and Kennedy Lewis Investment Management LLC, a $3 billion credit hedge fund in New York, were two of the biggest winners in the trade. Other significant investors include Avenue Capital Group, Guggenheim Partners LLC, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s asset-management arm and Pacific Investment Management Co. </p><p>   In February, when subfreezing temperatures forced the state's grid operator to call for widespread blackouts, some natural-gas plants in Texas were still able to sell electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes, often at higher than usual prices. Collectively, two companies -- Temple Generation I and TexGen Power -- that own many of the plants made more than an estimated $200 million over the storm's course, according to investors in the power-generation companies. </p><p>   Owning more than 90% of Temple and TexGen are overlapping sets of investment firms. </p><p>   In the wake of the Texas storm, there have been state hearings and public outrage at energy price increases that were pushed onto retailers. Some of the state's largest power-generation companies lost hundreds of millions of dollars each as they grappled with outages and gas-supply issues. </p><p>   The plants largely owned by Wall Street firms took steps in the days before the storm to increase the chances they would remain operational. In the end, they were among the few to actually make money. </p><p>   Fortress, Kennedy Lewis, Avenue, Guggenheim, JPMorgan's asset-management arm and Pimco declined to disclose the return on their investment or speak publicly about any profits. </p><p>   \"We are proud of the plant staff's performance and sacrifices they made to keep the lights on for Texans during this difficult time,\" said Temple Chief Executive Dan Hudson in a statement. </p><p>   Some of the plants benefited from having been built in recent years to withstand extremely cold weather. Temple and TexGen also took steps to manage risk. </p><p>   Management teams were focused on the storm and its potential severity as early as two weeks before it hit, investors said. They increased staffing levels, rented additional equipment and had crews of workers sleeping at the plants to take turns covering shifts. \"We knew we were going to have a week of hell,\" said one executive. </p><p>   Temple and TexGen Power also had secured multiple sources of natural gas when they emerged from bankruptcy in 2018, a decision that lessened the impact of gas shortages that hit systemwide. Additionally, they made strategic market decisions. </p><p>   Typically, power companies lock in some prices in advance in a practice known as hedging. This helps them guarantee a certain amount of revenue by contracting to sell power at certain prices, even if they miss out on additional gains should prices actually be higher later. But TexGen bought back some of its hedge contracts in advance of the storm, said people familiar with the company's operations, meaning it could sell more electricity directly into Texas' power grid at the peak price of $9,000 per megawatt hour during the storm. </p><p>   The decision to unwind some hedges limited potential losses for TexGen should its plants experience operational failures during the storm. Generators risk losses if their power plants fail given that they are expected to either produce the power they contract to sell or to purchase replacement power at market prices. A failure to operate and deliver power could have cost a plant like Temple more than $70 million a day during the storm, said people familiar with the plant. </p><p>   Whether the profits will be fully realized is unclear, but much of the gains have already been realized by the companies, said people familiar with Temple and TexGen. </p><p>   Still, Texas lawmakers are debating how to address the storm's huge costs, which have driven some retail power suppliers and cooperatives to seek bankruptcy protection and raised the prospect that other market participants might have to help pay their debts. Some market participants have sued the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state's grid operator also known as Ercot, over pricing issues, potentially challenging its ability to collect payments. Ercot has maintained that prices were justified given the power scarcity. </p><p>   The state senate in mid-March passed legislation requiring that the state's utility commission reprice some of the electricity sold during the storm, but the House didn't take up the measure. The deadline for repricing passed last month. </p><p>   Investors in the plants described their investments as strengthening Texas' energy infrastructure while providing gains to their own pension and endowment clients. </p><p>   Many of these Wall Street firms started eyeing what are now Temple and TexGen in 2016 as the companies' debt started to get distressed amid historically low power prices. The Texas power market has gotten increasingly competitive in recent years amid the rapid, federally subsidized build-out of wind and solar power. </p><p>   In 2017, the companies, then called Panda Temple Power LLC and Exelon Generation Texas Power LLC, filed for bankruptcy. </p><p>   For the most part, the investment funds bought debt or bankruptcy claims at a discount from existing lenders, or bought equity in the plants from shareholders after they were restructured. Sellers included lenders who had been involved for a steady stream of interest payments and weren't interested in becoming part-owners of power plants. In both cases, senior secured lenders swapped their debt for equity in the restructured companies. </p><p>   The funds' broad bet was that energy prices would rebound. </p><p>   These firms reasoned that Texas' population was growing fast and electricity-thirsty businesses, such as liquefied natural-gas projects, were being built on the Gulf Coast. At the same time, older coal generators and gas steam plants seemed poised for retirement and few natural-gas plants had been built because of low power prices in recent years. Some investors said they believed renewable energy sources hadn't penetrated Texas as deeply as some data suggested. </p><p>   The plants could generate free cash flow off summertime energy demands. As renewables became a larger share of the supply, some investors saw the potential for additional gains from increased power-price volatility when the wind wasn't blowing or the sun wasn't shining. Temple and TexGen emerged from bankruptcy in 2018. </p><p>   When the storm hit, living quarters and provisions that had been prepared at Temple in case employees needed to quarantine for Covid-19 were repurposed. A facility the generator uses to store natural gas for itself provided up to a quarter of the gas the plant used during the storm, buffering the impact of systemwide gas shortages. </p><p>   TexGen was able to profit despite one plant remaining offline for about half of the storm when the lake supplying water to it froze, the people familiar with its operations said. TexGen also brought in supplemental crews of construction workers who helped weld shut burst pipes. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jonathan Randles contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
