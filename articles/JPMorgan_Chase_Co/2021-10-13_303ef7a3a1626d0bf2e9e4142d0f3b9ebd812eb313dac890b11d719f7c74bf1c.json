Here are the numbers to watch in this week's earnings</p><p>Analysts expect S&amp;P 500&#xa0;earnings to rise 27.6% annually, a pace markedly slower than a 52.8% gain in the first quarter and 92.4% in the second quarter, which both benefited from favorable comparisons versus the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The numbers are due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>The data will show how a 13% rally in U.S. crude prices has hit inflation, with chances of a stronger number more likely than a softer one, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, in a note to clients.</p><p>“And a strong inflation [number] will only reinforce the expectation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would start tapering its bond purchases by next month, that's already priced in. Yet, a too strong figure could boost expectations of an earlier rate hike from the Fed, and that's not necessarily fully priced in,” said the analyst.</p><p>Later on Wednesday, investors will get the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes. That could “reiterate the Fed's willingness to start tapering the bond purchases soon and could give a further insight regarding the need and the possibility of seeing the rate normalization happen before 2023,” said Ozkardeskaya.</p>",
