  "title": "Baby Gear Rental Startup Loop Hires Former Glossier Marketing Chief as CEO; Ali Weiss is the latest in a small group of former marketing executives to become a chief executive",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Weiss had been CMO of Glossier for seven years when she left the beauty company in July and previously held various roles in finance at asset manager BlackRock Inc.</p><p>She joins a handful of other marketing executives who have risen to CEO posts, including Kristin Lemkau, who in 2019 was promoted from CMO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to chief executive of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, and Paul Chibe, the CEO of Pabst Brewing Co. and former U.S. chief marketing officer of Anheuser-Busch InBev. Jen Cho, who joined women-focused co-working company the Wing as its CMO last year, was promoted to the role of CEO in February before departing the company in July, a month before it shut down.</p><p>Ms. Weiss said her experience as a top marketer at a fast-growing startup will be useful in her role at Loop.</p><p>\"Ultimately, the best CMOs are intrinsically consumer-centric,\" she said. \"They make all their decisionsâ€¦consumer-first, customer-first. For us at Loop, it's member-first.\"</p><p>The company plans to hire a marketing leader who will report to Ms. Weiss.</p><p>Revenue for brick-and-mortar U.S. stores that sell durable goods for babies and toddlers up to four years old will total an estimated $11 billion in 2022, according to industry-research firm IBISWorld Inc. That figure includes sales of baby products such as furniture, car seats and strollers, but not from retailers who primarily sell toys or clothing.</p><p>Though some rental competitors focus on equipment such as strollers and car seats for travel, Loop intends to focus on items for consumers' homes, Ms. Weiss said.</p><p>The company's rentals can appeal to parents who want to reduce clutter or their environmental impact, according to Ms. Weiss.</p><p>Ms. Weiss said that baby gear and toys \"have very long useful lives in the world, but pretty short useful lives at home because children are growing and changing so quickly.\"</p><p>Loop plans to expand next year into geographic areas that are yet to be determined.</p><p>\"Our vision is that we're able to provide this service across many markets, many cities, many metro areas across the U.S.,\" Ms. Weiss said.</p><p>The company also sees an opportunity to begin offering products for older children, she said.</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p>",
