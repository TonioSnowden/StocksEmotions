  "text": "<p>BlackRock Inc. said Friday that its second-quarter profit fell 22% amid a bruising market downturn.</p><p>The world's largest asset manager reported net income of $1.08 billion, down from $1.38 billion in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Earnings amounted to $7.06 a share. That missed the $7.87 expected by analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Revenue dipped 6% to $4.53 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates of $4.55 billion.</p><p>The market is tumbling this year after three years of double-digit gains, with the S&amp;P 500 recently posting its worst first half in more than 50 years. Inflation remains at a four-decade high, roiling households and businesses, and investors are bracing for a possible recession as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to try to curb prices.</p><p>The turmoil is affecting BlackRock and other financial firms broadly. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley, which reported earnings on Thursday, said their investment bankers brought in far less revenue than a year ago, with an uncertain economy forcing corporate chieftains to the sidelines. But the two banks' traders benefited from the volatility, bringing in more revenue.</p><p>BlackRock is a top provider of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost alternatives that track market indexes, and demand for what is called passive investing has helped fuel the firm's growth. BlackRock is also a large provider of what are known as actively managed investments, which can include businesses like stock-and bond-picking funds.</p><p>BlackRock's base management fees—those not tied to performance that the firm receives for administering fund holdings—dipped 2%, decreasing to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Performance fees from the firm's actively managed funds fell 69% to $106 million, with the biggest decline coming from its single-strategy hedge funds.</p><p>Revenue from Aladdin, its proprietary software that helps investors manage their portfolios, rose 5% to $332 million.</p><p>The firm brought in nearly $90 billion in new investor money in the quarter, up from about $81 billion in the same period a year ago.</p><p>The firm's assets under management were about $8.5 trillion, down from $9.6 trillion in the first quarter. This is the second time in a row that BlackRock reported a quarter-over-quarter decline in assets under management. The firm ended 2022 with $10.01 trillion in assets, the first time any money manager surpassed that milestone.</p><p>BlackRock shares fell in premarket trading. They were down 36% for the year through Thursday.</p><p>Write to Angel Au-Yeung at angel.au-yeung@wsj.com</p><p>BlackRock Profit Falls 22%</p>",
