  "title": "Business News:  AMC Chief to Sell  $53 Million in Stock  ----  By Alexander Gladstone",
  "text": "<p>    Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., on Tuesday filed to sell about $53 million of his shares in the company. </p><p>   AMC, the world's largest cinema chain, with nearly 1,000 theaters world-wide, has become known for an enthusiastic base of individual investors who often coalesce on social media around their supposed commitment to hold on to shares and never sell them. Mr. Aron has leaned into AMC's status as a meme stock and regularly engages with his online fan base. </p><p>   Mr. Aron hired J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to handle the sale of 1.25 million shares, according to a securities filing. A separate filing on Wednesday showed he sold half of those shares Tuesday at an average price of $40.53. He will transact all the sales under a prearranged trading plan he adopted in August. </p><p>   Mr. Aron had said on an earnings call Monday that he would soon begin selling some of his shares. </p><p>   \"I can only imagine that naysayers and others who wish AMC harm will try to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt in this regard,\" Mr. Aron said, noting that even after his sales he will still own more than 2 million shares. </p><p>   \"If you do the math, you will see that with this much current and future ownership of AMC, I have an enormous personal stake in the future of our company, of your company,\" he said. </p><p>   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, AMC reported nearly 40 million attendees, up from 22 million in the prior quarter but still behind pre-pandemic levels. Higher vaccination rates have played a role in the improvement, while new movies like the James Bond installment \"No Time to Die\" and \"Dune\" have also helped AMC sell tickets since the quarter ended, Mr. Aron said on the call. </p><p>   The company reported a net loss of $224 million for the quarter, an improvement from the net loss of $906 million it reported for the same period in 2020. AMC came close to having to file for bankruptcy during the pandemic and was able to improve its financial position by selling shares to individual investors. </p><p></p>",
