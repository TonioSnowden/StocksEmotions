  "title": "Fed Approves U.S. Bancorp Acquisition of MUFG Union Bank; Central bank signals it is starting related rule-making process to ease wind down of failed regional banks",
  "text": "<p>The approval of U.S. Bancorp's deal gives the firm just under $700 billion in assets and solidifies its status as the fifth-largest retail bank in the country. When the deal was announced last year, the Minneapolis- based bank said the acquisition would give it the scale to compete with the largest consumer banks in California, including in the lucrative markets of Los Angeles, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, where MUFG Union Bank has branches.</p><p>Relatedly, top banking regulators are seeking to address concerns that the steady growth of the nation's largest regional banks has introduced new risks to the financial system. In addition to the U.S. Bancorp deal, Bank of Montreal struck a deal to buy BNP Paribas SA's Bank of the West and Toronto-Dominion Bank has a deal to buy Tennessee-based First Horizon Corp. All three require federal approval.</p><p>While these firms may lack the vast trading floors and international operations of megabanks like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp., the biggest regionals' balance sheets are now approaching the size of some of so-called systemically important banks.</p><p>The approval of regional bank mergers had slowed while regulators considered whether to impose heightened requirements on the firms through new rules, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.</p><p>\"As the banking system changes, policymakers must continuously evaluate whether resolution-related standards and prudential standards for large banks keep pace,\" Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chairman for banking supervision, said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>Friday's measure seeks public comment on several potential new requirements and resources that could be used for an orderly resolution of these large banking organizations, including a long-term debt requirement that currently only applies to the biggest global banks, the Fed said.</p><p>The long-term debt would serve as an added layer of protection. If a large regional bank got in trouble, the debt would be converted into equity that would recapitalize the bankâ€”a \"bail in\" that puts losses on the investors as opposed to a \"bailout\" by taxpayers.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Fed Approves U.S. Bancorp Acquisition of MUFG Union Bank</p>",
