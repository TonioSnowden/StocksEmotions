  "title": "Tyson Foods CFO Arrested After Authorities Say He Fell Asleep in Wrong Home; John R. Tyson, great-grandson of firm's founder, arrested over the weekend, local law-enforcement officials say",
  "text": "<p>John R. Tyson, Tyson Foods Inc.'s chief financial officer and son of the meat giant's chairman, was arrested over the weekend after authorities said he fell asleep in the wrong house.</p><p>Mr. Tyson, 32 years old, was found asleep in a woman's bed at her home in Fayetteville, Ark., on Sunday morning, according to a preliminary arrest report filed by the Fayetteville Police Department. He was arrested for criminal trespass and public intoxication, according to the report, and booked at the Washington County Detention Center. He was released Sunday evening.</p><p>A spokesman for Tyson Foods said the company is aware of the incident, and because it is a personal matter the company had no additional comment. Mr. Tyson didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Tyson, the great-grandson of Tyson Foods's founder, was promoted to the CFO role for the $24 billion meat company in September and took over the job at the start of October. He is the youngest chief financial officer serving at a company in the S&amp;P 500 or Fortune 500, according to Crist Kolder, an executive-search firm.</p><p>Before taking over as CFO, he had been serving as Tyson's executive vice president of strategy and chief sustainability officer, roles he still holds.</p><p>The company's shares declined 1.6% in midday trading Monday, while major U.S. stock indexes increased slightly.</p><p>The Fayetteville Police Department's report said that the woman told police that she believed Mr. Tyson came in through an unlocked front door, and that she didn't know him. The report said that police attempted to wake Mr. Tyson but that, after briefly sitting up, he laid back down and tried to resume sleeping and that there was an odor of intoxicants on his breath and body.</p><p>Mr. Tyson's arrest was earlier reported by KNWA/Fox 24 in Northwest Arkansas.</p><p>Mr. Tyson joined Tyson in September 2019, after earning a master's of business administration degree from Stanford University in 2018. He has held various roles in investment banking, private equity, and venture capital, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>Some in the meat industry have pegged Mr. Tyson as a future leader of the company, as either the CEO or chairman. My. Tyson has said he is focused on fulfilling his current duties.</p><p>The Tyson family's interests maintain an approximate 71% voting stake at the company, according to the company's latest annual filing, through holdings of Class B stock that hold 10 times the voting power of the publicly held Class A shares. Dual-class stock arrangements, which grant such \"supervoting\" rights to a separate class of stock not available to the general public, allow holders of a minority equity stake to control a company.</p><p>Write to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com</p><p>Tyson Foods CFO Arrested After Authorities Say He Fell Asleep in Wrong Home</p>",
