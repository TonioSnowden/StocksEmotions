  "text": "<p>Closing markets forestalled an expected fire sale of Russian assets, investors say.</p><p>Russia's central-bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said last week that the Moscow Exchange would reopen gradually, but provided no details beyond the bond buying. Russia's stock market remains closed.</p><p>Ms. Nabiullina, recently nominated for a third term, said the central bank would purchase Russian government bonds to prevent excessive volatility and ensure smooth trading.</p><p>A Russian local-currency bond maturing in March 2033 fell to 67.9% of its face value, also known as par, from about 87% ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to FactSet.</p><p>Russia's central bank doubled interest rates at the outset of the war to 20%. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds, which pay a lower rate of interest, drop in value. Passive funds that track benchmark indexes to determine what they hold will be among those forced to sell.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase Co. has said it would exclude Russian sovereign and corporate debt from all of its widely tracked fixed-income indexes, effective March 31.</p><p>Russia averted defaulting on a dollar-denominated bond last week, but could default on a local-currency bond that was due for payment earlier this month but that foreign investors haven't received. Ratings company Fitch said if the Russian state doesn't pay holders of its local-currency bonds in the 30 days after it didn't forward payments to foreign bondholders on March 2, it would declare the country in default.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
