Dimon's staff were told to return to their desks this week, a demand sweetened with the offer of free food. </p> <p>But, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7761ee-b7a2-48f2-9226-fe20277c2498\">FT analysis</a> shows, their views are not necessarily shared by the rest of the banking sector. Some institutions, such as Bank of America, are aiming for a September return, while others such as HSBC have yet to set a date and remain more open to remote working — and reducing the size of their office footprint.</p> <p>Views differ across the Atlantic. “There is an emphasis with a lot of American banks on . . . working in-person [and] having those in-person interactions with clients,” explained Stefanie Coleman, an adviser at consultants EY. European institutions such as Société Générale, on the other hand, are happy to let bankers work from home up to three days a week. The bank has reached a deal with French unions that has become a template for their other employees across the world.</p> <p>NatWest said just 13 per cent of staff would work in the office full-time, with 32 per cent expected to work mainly from home and 55 per cent taking a hybrid approach. “I would say that we've busted the myth that jobs need to be done in a certain way,” said NatWest chief Alison Rose.</p> <p>There are strong differences too between bosses and their staff. “Business executives want to move back to the office more aggressively, more quickly than their employees do,” said PWC's Bhushan Sethi. Lower-paid workers are also less keen to return to the old days of long and expensive commutes.</p> <p>Vaccinations are another point of contention. Goldman is demanding US bankers provide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12116828-5ad3-43c0-ae57-6148b1adee6f\">proof they have been inoculated</a>, whereas rivals are still relying on a voluntary approach. Subject to religious and medical exemptions, a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws\">legal ruling in December</a> paved the way for companies to bar non-vaccinated staff.</p> <p>Wall Street bosses may have a point about the importance of office life for fostering corporate culture — especially for younger workers — says Sujeet Indap, US editor of the FT's Lex column, but they need to act “in a spirit of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae58e2bc-c49a-4e88-aae2-47512f90228f\">camaraderie rather than recrimination</a>”.</p> <p>Instead of acting the tough guy, “they need to listen to the worries of those lower down the corporate ladder, who are exposed to high living costs, long commutes and childcare problems”, he writes.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>Investors are keenly awaiting new economic projections from the <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong>, due at 2pm ET today, and in particular the outlook for inflation and signs that the central bank may start raising interest rates sooner than expected. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56ce9fae-6c5d-4a27-83c8-7a40271a9ecc\">Read our backgrounder</a>. </p> <p>Today is a landmark moment for the <strong>EU's €800bn</strong> <strong>recovery plan</strong>, with Brussels set to approve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59e582a1-bfd5-4b38-8626-27f9b9c59a5a\">spending proposals from Spain and Portugal</a>. The European Commission yesterday began issuing bonds to raise the funds to pay for the package, although the FT revealed that some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/130cf192-8fe0-4edb-a962-2625107eae2f\">big-name banks were excluded</a> from the sale because of historical breaches of antitrust rules.</p> <p><strong>UK inflation </strong>in May jumped more than expected — and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f00ae4f1-e347-4951-9006-933c5b440fb8\">beyond the Bank of England's target</a> — to 2.1 per cent, as the loosening of lockdown curbs drove up prices in clothing, fuel and meals, as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab50dc67-92da-4809-83cb-091837f80871\">increasing employment</a>. Business columnist Helen Thomas warned, however, that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b67ec83-f303-4e65-968b-216573e0fa6a\">government help for pandemic-stricken companies</a> must be better targeted. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>Tokyo correspondent Kana Inagaki reports on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76796db2-8bc2-436a-b8d0-516700141bb2\">predicament facing Japanese companies</a> involved in the upcoming <strong>Olympics</strong>. “As one sponsor grimly acknowledged, silence is the best marketing strategy to navigate a toxic environment where any association with the event could potentially be&#xa0;damaging for the corporate brand,” she writes. FT analysis reveals the Games may need a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cd58c64-039e-4147-a744-af676de1691d\">cash injection of $800m</a> if coronavirus safeguards mean they are held behind closed doors. </p> <p>The top football clubs in England's <strong>Premier League</strong> last season suffered their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93ad309a-a02f-4ba9-8b38-8e694cbdc2cc\">worst collective loss</a> in the competition's history of almost £1bn, as the pandemic hit revenues from sponsors and fans. FT analysis showed champions Manchester City recorded a loss of £125.1m, second only to Everton, which made a loss of £139.9m. European rivals such as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus faced similar losses.</p> <p><strong>Watch:</strong> The FT's Daniel Garrahan and food critic Tim Hayward meet Harts Group, the business behind London institution Quo Vadis and tapas chain Barrafina to discuss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/4333b9cc-e5ef-458b-91ec-14123b13f106\">prospects for the restaurant industry</a> as the end of lockdown draws nearer. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/4333b9cc-e5ef-458b-91ec-14123b13f106.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>China said it would release batches of <strong>copper, aluminium and zinc</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf601bb0-4c24-4cd6-acc7-cd4eb263d574\">combat shortages and high prices</a>. Metals have been at the forefront of the market rally in global commodities prices, fuelled initially by a rapid pandemic recovery in China and now in the rest of the world</p> <p><strong>Top commodity traders</strong> at firms such as Trafigura are forecasting a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b27ac2bb-69c9-4e06-94e5-f7373b4de5ba\">return to $100-a barrel oil</a> as&#xa0;investment in new supplies slows and before the move to clean energy consolidates. Some believe growth in the developing world could mean global demand will only start to fall from about 2040.</p> <p><strong>Equity investments</strong> in small UK companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/788691d4-1ba7-4a92-9f19-c895f0464a73\">hit a record £8.8bn last year</a> — an increase of 9 per cent — and continued into the first three months of 2021 when a further £4.5bn was raised, according to the British Business Bank. Although companies in sectors such as hospitality struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic, those in ecommerce and digital services benefited as demand increased, attracting cash from investors sitting on a pile of unspent funds.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>WakeUpInTheRealWorld comments on&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffd6033f-e8fc-4289-85b2-42bc4ddddd16?commentID=033169fd-52c6-4bb1-91e4-1581d4f482c0\">Morgan Stanley chief talks tough on the return to the office</a>.</p> <blockquote>  <p>I've been saying the same thing since the beginning of lockdown only to be told by others I am wrong. When the majority, if not all, outside meeting places (gyms, cafés, etc) have been closed, and the ability to meet people very limited, working from home has worked well. Once everything is open and people are out and about, there will be a lot of distractions, making it harder to be as efficient. Face to face contact and interactions with others are a part of human nature, while sitting in front of screens all day is not. Saving time on commuting is great, but one has to be realistic and honest about the trade-offs. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>“As we come out of a period of sadness, I want to make art that encourages people to slow down, to leave their screens and look at nature, to find solace in the world around us.” Browse <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/484148f9-5ab7-4c2b-934b-748f69e3191d\">our guide to some of the most beautiful new installations</a> of outdoor art.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Global banks divided over return to the office' FT.com 16 June.
