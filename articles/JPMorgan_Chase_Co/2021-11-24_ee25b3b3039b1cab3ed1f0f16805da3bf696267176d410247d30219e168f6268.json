  "title": "Jamie Dimon apologises twice after saying JPMorgan will outlast China's Communist party",
  "text": "<p>Jamie Dimon has issued two separate apologies to China after telling a group of US business leaders that JPMorgan Chase would outlast the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>In a speech in Boston on Tuesday the bank's chief executive had referred to the party's 100th anniversary, remarking that JPMorgan was the same age. “I'll make a bet that we last longer,” he said, adding: “I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway.”</p> <p>The bank scrambled on Wednesday to mitigate any damage to relations with the country, where JPMorgan has spent decades laying the groundwork to take advantage of its growing prosperity.</p> <p>First, Dimon issued a statement: “I regret and should not have made that comment. I was trying to emphasise the strength and longevity of our company.”</p> <p>Hours later he apologised again. “I regret my recent comment because it's never right to joke about or denigrate any group of people, whether it's a country, its leadership, or any part of a society and culture. Speaking in that way can take away from constructive and thoughtful dialogue in society, which is needed now more than ever.”</p> <p>Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund, said: “If the apology was effusive, the Chinese Communist party might let it go.” She added that the longevity of the party “isn't a topic that China likes to call attention to”. </p> <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment. </p> <p>Dimon's comments to the business forum came less than a week after he made a surprise one-day <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2a61edb-10e9-405c-bd82-26c2651a5c34\">visit</a> to Hong Kong, becoming the first Wall Street banking boss to go to the Chinese territory since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Leaders of global businesses that rely on operating in China for a large portion of revenues are typically cautious about commenting on Beijing. A number of foreign companies such as HSBC and law firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5383949a-45e9-41a0-bd8d-914c63968b76\">Mayer Brown</a> have faced a backlash in China over perceived criticism. </p> <p>In 2019, Swiss bank UBS was excluded from some Chinese state-backed deals after one of its economists made a comment about “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e588600-90be-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271\">pigs in China</a>” that was perceived as a slur.</p> <p>JPMorgan said Dimon acknowledged he “should never speak lightly or disrespectfully about another country or its leadership”.</p> <p>“During the discussion, Jamie made clear China and its people are very smart and very thoughtful,” the bank added, and that Dimon “strongly supports a constructive and detailed economic dialogue with China”.</p> <p>JPMorgan has operated in China since 1921, the same year the Communist party was founded. It has said that growth in the country represents one of the largest opportunities for the bank and its clients.</p> <p>JPMorgan this year won approval from Chinese regulators to run a wholly owned investment bank in the country, which was a landmark moment for foreign banks' access to China's financial sector. It also operates asset and wealth management joint ventures there.</p> <p>Dimon's visit to Hong Kong prompted some consternation that the chief executive was granted a rare exemption from the city's strict quarantine rules. JPMorgan has since said it will compensate staff who had to quarantine up to $5,000.</p> <p>Referring to tension between the US and China, Dimon said in Hong Kong that he was “not swayed by geopolitical winds” and he believed world leaders would work out “rational” solutions.</p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington 2021 'Jamie Dimon apologises twice after saying JPMorgan will outlast China's Communist party' FT.com 24 November.
