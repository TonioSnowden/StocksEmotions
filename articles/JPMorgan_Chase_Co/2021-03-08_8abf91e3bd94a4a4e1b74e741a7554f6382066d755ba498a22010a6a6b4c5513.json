  "title": "Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- How to Avoid a Credit-Card Surprise When a Spouse Dies --- There's a difference between a joint account and an 'authorized user'",
  "text": "<p>\"I know so many women who have a card that has their name on it, but it isn't really their card,\" says Karen Altfest, executive vice president at Altfest Personal Wealth Management in New York, who is now working with the widow.</p><p>The problem, Ms. Altfest and others say, is that consumers often don't understand the differences between having a joint credit-card account -- one in which both parties have charging privileges and are equally responsible for the debt -- and an account issued to a primary cardholder, who designates additional authorized users. In the latter, both parties have charging privileges, but the primary cardholder is generally solely liable for the debt.</p><p>Joint credit cards are often used by couples to handle household expenses. But when one spouse doesn't have a strong credit history -- for example, because he or she is a stay-at-home parent -- the card is typically issued to a primary cardholder who can then name additional authorized users. Having more users can build up whatever rewards points a card might offer.</p><p>And some credit cards permit a primary cardholder to set spending limits on authorized users. Parents often name college-age children as authorized users to help them build or rehabilitate their credit records. Most of the biggest credit-card issuers do report to the credit bureaus on authorized users, but in some cases, the impact of the card's activity on the authorized user's credit record isn't as significant as for a primary cardholder.</p><p>It is easy to remove an authorized user from an account with a request either from the primary account holder or from the authorized user. For one of the parties in a joint account to be removed, by contrast, both parties must agree to release that person from liability. The bank will check the credit of the remaining user to be sure he or she is worthy of the credit line.</p><p>As happened with Ms. Altfest's client, revelations may be in store when a couple is divorced or when a primary cardholder dies. If a card represents a joint account, the second user can typically go on using the card, but he or she will also be responsible for any debt. If a husband dies owing $50,000 on a joint credit card, his wife on that account is liable for that debt.</p><p>But authorized users may find their card canceled because of the primary holder's death. They can then apply for their own credit line, but they might find that their credit history isn't sufficient.</p><p>Authorized users -- whether a spouse or not -- are generally not liable for debt left on a credit card when the primary holder dies. The debt is generally assumed by the decedent's estate. The law in some states does hold a spouse who is an authorized user responsible.</p><p>When both spouses qualify, there can be advantages to holding a joint credit-card account, says Kristin Carlton, a San Antonio-based senior wealth adviser with Exencial Wealth Advisers, a registered investment adviser. One of her clients lost hundreds of thousands of membership rewards when her husband, the card's primary holder, died.</p><p>Still, while all of the financial institutions named in this article allow primary consumer cardholders to add authorized users, many have moved away from offering joint accounts, because designating one party legally responsible for the debt makes the process easier for the card companies if they have to take legal action to collect. \"To have two payers, it just muddies the waters,\" says Ms. Altfest.</p><p>Financial institutions that still offer joint accounts include Bank of America Corp., PNC Bank and U.S. Bancorp. Bank of America offers joint cards only on a limited basis.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. hasn't offered new joint general-purpose credit-card accounts since 2017. Other institutions that don't offer joint consumer credit-card accounts include Capital One Financial Corp., Citigroup, Discover Financial Services and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>A family member should notify credit-card companies, credit bureaus and the estate's executor when a family member dies, and close out a credit-card account when its primary cardholder dies, says Duncan Rolph, managing partner at Miracle Mile Advisors, an investment advisory firm in Los Angeles. That helps to eliminate any recurring charges that may be going onto the card, he says.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Maxey is a writer in Union City, N.J. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p>",
