  "text": "<p>Now, HSBC says business is primed to take off, mainly because rising rates will boost its earnings.</p><p>But there's \"a fundamental disconnect,\" between the optimism among HSBC executives and shareholders' unease, said John Cronin, a banking analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers. \"I think the share price is telling you the market is very, very worried about recession risks.\"</p><p>This year, central banks including the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England rapidly raised rates to tamp down inflation. That is generally bad for corporations and households. But it is good news for banks like HSBC, which can make more money on loans.</p><p>HSBC says that development -- coupled with retail branch closures, office downsizing and other cost cutting -- will return a key measure of profitability to its highest level in a decade by next year.</p><p>It said in August that for each percentage-point jump in market-based interest rates, the money it earns annually from interest would rise by about $4.7 billion.</p><p>\"It's revolutionary,\" for HSBC that rates are rising back toward historical norms, said Alastair Ryan, a Bank of America banking analyst. \"HSBC's business model was just structurally really disadvantaged by that period of zero rates.\"</p><p>After the 2008 global financial crisis, HSBC cut back in various areas, exiting its U.S. home-lending business. It expanded in offering insurance -- particularly in Hong Kong, its biggest market -- and facilitating trade. HSBC has relied less on businesses such as investment banking and credit cards that generated big returns for peers like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>Now that rates are rising, HSBC will continue to have a big source of cheap capital -- the customer accounts that pay depositors little or no interest -- that it can use to fund lending that generates higher returns, such as mortgages. Also, HSBC has a huge pile of cash reserves at the Bank of England for which it will be paid more in interest.</p><p>HSBC said in August that the amount it earns in interest -- net interest income -- is set to rise 15% this year and another 19% next year, to $37 billion.</p><p>\"You're going from a decade of unacceptably low profitability to a period of quite reasonable profitability,\" Mr. Ryan said. \"It's going from a bank not working for shareholders to one that should be working pretty well.\"</p><p>HSBC's top shareholder, China's Ping An Insurance, has pushed to revamp the company in a way that would isolate its Asian operations from its operations elsewhere, in a bid to boost its share price.</p><p>HSBC, in a rebuttal, said in August that higher interest income is one reason it expects its return on tangible equity -- a key measure of profitability -- to reach 12% next year, its highest level in a decade. The bank said a restructuring would disrupt that progress.</p><p>Rising rates carry risks for banks. The central-bank moves are designed to cool the economy by slowing demand. If loan demand weakens and borrowers default on loans, banks like HSBC stand to suffer losses.</p><p>The stakes are higher in this rate cycle because rocketing inflation is forcing monetary authorities to act forcefully even when economies aren't in great shape. In August, the Bank of England warned that Britain -- one of HSBC's biggest markets -- could be headed for a recession that would last five quarters.</p>",
