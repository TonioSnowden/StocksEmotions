  "title": "Student-Loan Pause: How to Take Advantage of Extra Four Months; With student-loan payments on hold until end of August, here are five ways to put extension to good use",
  "text": "<p>The need to implement these changes is crucial now. Inflation is eating into people's budgets, and the reprieve in student loans could be just long enough to make meaningful course corrections.</p><p>\"Enjoy the relief but also use it as an opportunity,\" said Bobbi Rebell, the author of \"Launching Financial Grownups.\"</p><p>Here are five ways to make the most of the extra time:</p><p>Budget as if there were no pause</p><p>The eventual resumption of student-loan payments will feel like a pay cut to the roughly 40 million borrowers who have benefited from the moratorium. So to prepare your budget for the return of this expense, it pays to start living now as if the money is actually due each month, said Jay Zigmont, a financial planner in Water Valley, Miss.</p><p>\"You have about four months to create a good habit, so start now,\" he said.</p><p>Use the time to identify areas where you can cut back on your spending gradually, so any reduction in your lifestyle doesn't feel like as much of a shock later, said Stanley Himeno-Okamoto, a financial planner in San Francisco.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How will extending student-loan payments help improve your finances or the finances of the student in your life?</p><p>For instance, to start saving money on gas, bundle several errands into one trip, said Mr. Himeno-Okamoto. Check if you are still using some of the subscriptions you bought during lockdowns, he said. A JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. bank study from 2021 found that 71% of Americans wasted more than $50 a month on unused recurring expenses such as subscription fees.</p><p>Another move is to sell belongings that haven't been used in over a year, said Mark Kantrowitz, a college-savings specialist.</p><p>Keep paying your loans</p><p>If you can afford it, there is a big payoff for continuing to make your student-loan payments despite the pause, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.</p><p>Since no interest is charged on your debt at present, \"every dollar you can put toward federal student loans will go toward reducing the loan balance,\" Mr. McBride said.</p><p>If you owe $10,000 in federal Stafford loans at a graduate-school loan rate of 5.28%, making your regular payments for the next five months without being charged any interest will pay down an additional $217 in principal, and will get the loan paid off in three fewer payments over the next decade, he said.</p><p>Focus on other debtâ€”or your savings</p><p>Those carrying credit-card balances should use this time to try to pay those down to avoid even higher interest asrates rise, said Alyssum Malone, a financial planner in Colorado Springs, Colo.</p><p>If you can, you should also use these months of extra cash flow to build up an emergency fund. For people who have already stashed their emergency savings, Ms. Malone recommends investing the funds, either by increasing your company 401(k) contributions or by contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify.</p><p>\"Redirecting these funds can help you save for the future or minimize high interest debt,\" she said.</p><p>Look for ways to boost your income</p><p>If you have already drastically cut your expenses, then you might need to seek ways to boost your income before repayment starts, said Ms. Rebell.</p><p>Some questions to consider: When was the last time you asked for a raise? If you have been in your current job for a while, is this a time to look for opportunities elsewhere, without the financial stress of those additional payments? Is there a side hustle that could add to your income?</p><p>\"Ask yourself if your current income matches the financial trajectory that you're hoping for,\" she said.</p><p>Ask for help</p><p>When the student-loan moratorium does end, there will be other places to seek relief, said Edward Gottfried, director of product at Betterment at Work, the 401(k) unit of investment-advice company Betterment LLC.</p><p>Some employers now offer student-debt assistance, including debt-management programs that help staff pay down debt, said Mr. Gottfried. If your company doesn't offer a program for student-loan debt assistance, ask human resources if they would consider it.</p><p>The Goodly Jobs Board lets candidates browse job postings from thousands of companies that offer student-loan benefits. Employers can contribute as much as $5,250 for an employee annually toward eligible education expenses, such as student-loan assistance, without increasing the employee's gross taxable income.</p><p>If you don't have a job, contact the loan servicer before the restart of repayment to explore your options, such as economic-hardship deferment or income-driven repayment plan, said Mr. Kantrowitz. Make that call today to avoid a rush of borrowers making the same move, he said.</p><p>Write to Veronica Dagher at Veronica.Dagher@wsj.com</p><p>Student-Loan Pause: How to Take Advantage of Extra Four Months</p>",
