  "text": "<p>   Stocks rose to records as investors looked ahead to the corporate earnings season that kicks off this week. </p><p>   Gains among shares of large U.S. companies were broad-based, with nine of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors advancing. Financial stocks led with an advance of 1%, a day before big banks start reporting their quarterly results. The consumer staples and energy groups slipped for the day. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 rose 15.08 points, or 0.3%, to 4384.63, its 39th record close of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 126.02 points, or 0.4%, to 34996.18. The Nasdaq Composite added 31.32 points, or 0.2%, to 14733.24. All three indexes built on records set Friday. </p><p>   Earnings season begins in earnest Tuesday, and investors will be watching to see if companies' results -- and what executives have to say about business in coming months -- justify the high valuations in the equity market. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 traded Friday at nearly 22 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, above a five-year average of a little more than 18. The benchmark index has rallied 17% so far in 2021. </p><p>   Analysts expect that S&amp;P 500 profits rose 64% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That growth rate would be the highest in more than a decade but is measured against a period in which the pandemic had upended the business environment, causing a steep decline in profits. </p><p>   \"The numbers are going to look wacky and are going to be extremely hard to compare,\" said Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X, a provider of exchange-traded funds. \"So the future expectations I think are going to be much more valuable than the actual earnings amounts.\" </p><p>   Companies expected to report Tuesday include JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Group. Analysts expect the earnings season to show that the economic recovery has been good for the big banks. </p><p>   Still, with major indexes at records, investors have shown concern about the potential for pullbacks. Stocks wobbled last week before surging on Friday, while a drop in Treasury bond yields put markets on edge about a slowdown in growth. Investors said the spread of Covid-19 variants is a rising concern. </p><p>   \"Sentiment in equities remains bullish, but the Delta variant is a headwind for that. There's an ongoing concern, what if reopening is difficult to do?\" said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. </p><p>   Among individual stocks, shares of Virgin Galactic dropped $8.51, or 17%, to $40.69 after the aerospace and space travel company said it agreed to sell up to $500 million in stock. On Sunday, founder Richard Branson and other crew members reached the edge of space, bringing the company closer to its plans for taking passengers to and from space. </p><p>   Shares of L Brands rose $3.06, or 4.2%, to $76.56 after the retailer on Friday said its board approved the previously announced spinoff of the Victoria's Secret business into an independent publicly traded company. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 1.362, from 1.354% on Friday. Yields declined in the previous two weeks. </p><p>   \"The bond market really doesn't have a whole lot of catalysts to keep prices going up and yields going down from these levels,\" said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. \"We think that what you're going to see is a gradual rise in interest rates.\" </p><p>   Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7% to a record. </p><p>   Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.8%, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.4% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.7%. U.S. stock futures were down less than 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
