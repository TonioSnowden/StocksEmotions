  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase paid its chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Jamie_Dimon\">Jamie Dimon</a>, $31.5m for 2020, the same sum as the previous year, the US bank disclosed on Thursday.</p> <p>In a regulatory filing accompanying the figures, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e\">JPMorgan</a> said that “amid the unprecedented health and economic consequences of Covid-19” the bank reported record revenue and maintained a strong balance sheet, even while putting aside $12bn for credit losses.</p> <p>JPMorgan shares fell 8 per cent in 2020, despite a strong rally towards the end of the year, as banks' lending profits were hit hard by the falling interest rates and high loan-loss provisions that followed the outbreak of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">pandemic</a>.</p> <p>The KBW bank index lost 5.5 per cent on the year, and JPMorgan's closest rival, Bank of America, lost 7 per cent.</p> <p>JPMorgan, like several other Wall Street banks, had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a411b5cd-0155-4f30-b11d-14b43749fb65\">warned staff</a> that it would not be a bumper bonus season, despite strong performance from trading and investment banking divisions driven by last year's high volatility and falling rates.</p> <p>Banks are struggling to balance paying for performance with the perception that, as ordinary people are struggling during the pandemic, bankers are getting richer still.&#xa0;</p> <p>When it reported strong fourth-quarter results earlier this month, Mr Dimon urged caution, saying: “It's not like we're bragging, we're not.”</p> <p>JPMorgan is the first large US bank to report the compensation of its chief executive.&#xa0;Mr Dimon, 64, is consistently one of the highest-paid US bank bosses.</p> <p>As in 2019, his 2020 package consisted of $1.5m in cash base pay, a $5m cash bonus and $25m in “performance share units” that vest over several years and vary in value with the price of JPMorgan shares.</p> <p>Mr Dimon's year was also marked by a serious health crisis. In March he was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery when he suffered an acute aortic dissection, a potentially fatal condition triggered by a tear in the inner layer of a large blood vessel branching off the heart. He returned to full-time work a month later.<br></p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong in New York 2021 'JPMorgan Chase holds Jamie Dimon's annual pay steady at $31.5m' FT.com 21 January.
