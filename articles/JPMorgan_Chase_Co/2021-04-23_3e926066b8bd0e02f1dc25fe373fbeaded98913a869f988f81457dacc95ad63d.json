  "text": "<p>At a news conference, Ms. Lagarde said the eurozone economy wouldn't return to its pre-pandemic size until the second half of next year. That would be more than a year after the Congressional Budget Office expects the U.S. economy to have regained its precrisis size.</p><p>Divergence between the ECB and Federal Reserve has sweeping implications for the prices of bonds and other financial assets. \"If you look at expectations in the United States and the euro area, we are not on the same page,\" Ms. Lagarde said.</p><p>Federal Reserve policy makers will meet on April 27-28 to consider their next move. The Fed recently signaled that, unlike the ECB, it wouldn't try to check a recent rise in Treasury yields, prompting them to increase further. But Fed officials in recent weeks have pushed back on the notion that signs of a strong economic recovery had boosted the prospects of a rate increase this year.</p><p>The ECB said Thursday it would keep its key interest rate at minus 0.5% and continue to buy eurozone debt under an emergency 1.85 trillion euro bond-buying program, equivalent to $2.2 trillion, through at least March 2022.</p><p>It said it would buy those bonds at a \"significantly higher pace\" during the first months of this year, repeating a pledge made last month.</p><p>The eurozone economy is likely to grow at an annualized rate of 6% in the second quarter of 2021, after contracting 1% in the first three months of the year, according to JPMorgan. The U.S. economy is expected to grow at an annualized rate of almost 10% in the second quarter after about 5% in the first quarter, JPMorgan said.</p><p>ECB officials are expected to reconsider the pace of their bond-buying program at a policy meeting on June 10, when they will publish fresh forecasts for growth and inflation.</p>",
