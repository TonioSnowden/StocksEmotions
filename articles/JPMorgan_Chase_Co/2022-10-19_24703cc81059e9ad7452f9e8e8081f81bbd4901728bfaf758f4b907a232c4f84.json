  "title": "Recession Fears Hit Risky Mortgage Debt Amid Default Concerns; Faltering home prices are hurting investors' demand for junk-rated mortgage securities sold by housing giants Fannie and Freddie",
  "text": "<p>That has spooked some investors who hold securities tied to riskier cash flows from mortgage debt backed by Fannie and Freddie. Asset managers, pensions and hedge funds all invest in the roughly $60 billion CRT market, which acts as insurance for the two agencies against defaults on slices of roughly $4.5 trillion of mortgages that would otherwise spell losses for U.S. taxpayers.</p><p>As clouds darken over the housing market and the economy as a whole, investors are sending CRT prices lower and demanding greater compensation to hold them. Through last week, typical junk-grade CRTs were yielding 6.75 percentage points more than ultrasafe U.S. Treasury bonds, according to JPMorgan data.</p><p>Excluding a spike in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, that is near the highest levels since CRTs were introduced a decade ago. This January, the relative spread above Treasurys was just 3.42 percentage points.</p><p>Last week, spreads on junk corporate bonds with a comparable single-B credit rating were lower at 5.43 percentage points, according to index data from Intercontinental Exchange, reflecting a market perception that CRTs are riskier.</p><p>Fannie and Freddie don't make loans. Instead, they package other lenders' mortgages into securities and sell them to investors, guaranteeing payment if the underlying mortgages default.</p><p>Credit-risk transfers don't come with that guarantee. Instead, they appeal to investors who want to earn higher returns in exchange for the risk of losses if widespread mortgage defaults reach even relatively modest levels.</p><p>Mortgage rates are soaring, hitting a two-decade high of 6.92% last week. With affordability under pressure, the housing market has been one of the first corners of the economy to falter, denting CRTs' appeal compared with other corners of the bond market, said Paul Norris, head of structured products at investment manager Conning. He thinks prices could fall further from here.</p><p>\"Housing has been at the forefront of the current malaise,\" Mr. Norris said. \"I want to be able to go to the client and say I really believe in this asset class, but I can't make that case yet.\" Conning has shunned CRTs, recently preferring other junk-rated structured-finance securities, he said.</p><p>CRT prices have fallen so much that judging by spreads alone, the market looks like it is preparing for a housing crisis as bad as the 2008 recession, said Ben Hunsaker, a portfolio manager at Beach Point Capital Management.</p><p>Today, investors broadly agree that risks in the mortgage-finance system are better contained than in the mid-2000s, when some risky mortgage bonds helped spark the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</p><p>Since then, Fannie and Freddie have operated under federal conservatorship, with tighter credit standards for the mortgages they guarantee. Introduced in 2013, CRTs are one effort to shift some of the risk of mortgage defaults to private investors.</p><p>Some of these investors, undaunted by a bleak outlook for the housing market, are betting that the recent selloff in CRTs has been overdone. Real estate may falter in a coming recession, but it is unlikely that defaults will reach the levels they touched 15 years ago in aggregate, Mr. Hunsaker said. Instead, he blamed some of the large fall in CRT prices on big asset managers' selling the securities as clients pull their money out of bond funds amid this year's historic market rout.</p><p>Beach Point has bought CRTs this year, focusing on those tied to mortgages that homeowners signed onto in 2020 and 2021. Despite the recent slide in home prices, values have still risen from last year, cushioning these households' finances, Mr. Hunsaker said. Plus, the interest that CRT investors get rises and falls with market rates—unlike most junk bonds—protecting investors such as Beach Point from the risk of more rate increases from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"Housing is undeniably worse going forward today than it was a year ago, but as we dug into the market, we had a hard time underwriting the bear thesis,\" Mr. Hunsaker said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think mortgages will fare in an economic downturn? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Another potential boon for CRT investors: Fannie and Freddie have offered to buy back billions of dollars of CRTs over the last year, moves that could boost prices by reducing the supply of debt. Coming into 2022, investors had conversely expected a glut of new issuance that didn't fully materialize.</p><p>The two agencies pay a variable interest rate to CRT investors, but the interest payments from homeowners' mortgages are fixed. So when rates rise, buying back CRTs can be more economical for the agencies than paying ever-higher interest.</p><p>That is one reason investment manager Brandywine Global has also invested in CRTs this year, said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at the firm. She thinks that the selloff has been driven more by technical market factors than by underlying risks in the housing-finance system.</p><p>\"The quality of the credit is exceptional, and the underwriting is quite solid,\" she said, pointing to healthy household balance sheets and the high average credit scores typical of recent mortgage borrowers. CRT prices, on the other hand, appear to reflect expectations for significant housing distress that Ms. Chen doesn't believe likely.</p><p>\"I don't think spreads this wide are sustainable,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Recession Fears Hit Risky Mortgage Debt Amid Default Concerns</p>",
