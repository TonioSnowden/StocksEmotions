  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- President Biden's choice to lead a top banking regulator faced criticism at a hearing Thursday from moderate Democrats who hold the key to her nomination, leaving her confirmation prospects uncertain. </p><p>   Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) challenged Saule Omarova on her thinking and past writing on bank oversight. Mr. Tester also pressed her over remarks she made this year calling for smaller oil-and-gas companies to go bankrupt to aid the U.S. in tackling climate change. </p><p>   \"Do you see how risky that is, to make that statement?\" said Mr. Tester, a third-generation family farmer who said he feared a lone regulator with the discretion to decide whether to put his farm out of business. \"Do you see how dangerous that could be?\" </p><p>   Ms. Omarova, who is nominated to become the comptroller of the currency, said she misspoke and that her remarks weren't well-framed. \"My intention was . . . exactly the opposite,\" she said. \"We need to help those companies to get restructured.\" </p><p>   Support from moderate Democrats will be crucial to advancing the nomination of Ms. Omarova, a law professor at Cornell University, through the evenly divided Senate. Messrs. Tester and Warner were noncommittal and said they also were concerned about Ms. Omarova's opposition to 2018 legislation that eased post-financial-crisis rules on banks that they both helped author. </p><p>   With Republicans potentially unified in their opposition, Ms. Omarova likely needs to win approval from all Senate Democrats to secure the job. </p><p>   Mr. Biden this month nominated her to the post that supervises the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. </p><p>   Ms. Omarova's defenders include liberal-leaning Democrats such as Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the committee chairman, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. They say she is an accomplished banking expert who will stand up to the industry. </p><p>   At Thursday's hearing, Ms. Omarova pushed back against concerns some have raised about her ideas and background. </p><p>   \"Having grown up in an oppressive state-run system, with no free enterprise and no economic opportunity, I have a unique appreciation for our dynamic and diverse markets,\" Ms. Omarova, who was born in Kazakhstan when it was part of the Soviet Union, told the committee. \"Every American family should have the same opportunities that my family has had.\" </p><p>   Opponents fear that Ms. Omarova would carry out a progressive agenda if confirmed. Industry advocates and Republican critics cite a 2019 article in which she argued that the Fed should shrink large banks in certain circumstances. </p><p></p>",
