  "text": "<p>The Texas freeze is now a supply chain nightmare for auto makers. Toyota and Honda Motor Co. said Wednesday they would halt production at North American plants after power outages brought the world's largest petrochemical complex to a standstill. Toyota cited a shortage of petrochemicals for curtailments at a Kentucky factory and production cuts of a pickup truck built in Mexico. Honda pointed to port problems, the semiconductor shortage, pandemic-related issues and the crippling U.S. weather. American depositary shares of Toyota added 1% Wednesday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN +1.6%</p><p>Amazon hopes to score a touchdown following a new deal with the National Football League. The tech giant will become the new home of \"Thursday Night Football\" starting as soon as 2022, one of the long-term media deals the NFL unveiled Thursday. ESPN will hold on to \"Monday Night Football\" and its sister network ABC will join the rotation of broadcasters who televise the Super Bowl. The new deals show that the league is trying to embrace the digital platforms that attract younger audiences without alienating fans used to watching games on TV. Amazon shares rose 1.6% Friday.</p><p>EXTENDED STAY AMERICA INC.</p><p>STAY +13%</p><p>The beaten-down hotel industry is stirring back to life. Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital Group said Monday they teamed up to buy Extended Stay for $6 billion, the largest hotel acquisition since the start of the pandemic. The move signals expectations for increasing demand after the new coronavirus caused most tourism, conventions and travel to disappear. Extended Stay shares jumped 13% Monday.</p><p>ASTRAZENECA PLC</p><p>AZN -0.2%</p><p>Some European countries will resume vaccinating residents after AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine was cleared of blood-clot concerns. The European Union's health agency on Thursday said the vaccine was \"safe and effective\" and didn't increase the risk of blood clots, prompting bloc members including Germany, France, Italy and Spain to say they would resume inoculation campaigns. Many European countries recently suspended the vaccine's use because of concerns, slowing the sluggish vaccination rollout in Europe. American depositary shares of AstraZeneca lost 0.2% Friday.</p><p>FEDEX CORP.</p><p>FDX +6.1%</p><p>Last month's U.S. winter storms didn't stop FedEx from delivering a profit. The package giant reported Thursday that profit nearly tripled in the latest quarter and revenue rose 23%, despite significant delays from the winter freeze that disrupted delivery operations and sapped profit by $350 million. FedEx, like its competitor United Parcel Service, has been handling a surge in e-commerce orders during the pandemic as more people shop from home, and FedEx executives said they expected that trend to continue. FedEx shares gained 6.1% Friday.</p><p>UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC.</p><p>UBER -4.2%</p><p>Uber is making a costly shift in the U.K. The ride-hailing company said Tuesday it will reclassify its U.K. drivers as \"workers\" rather than independent contractors, entitling them to vacation pay and pension contributions. Uber announced the changes after losing its final appeal of lower-court decisions that granted former drivers a type of U.K. status that falls between employee and self-employed. In November, Uber won a major ballot battle in California that exempted it from having to reclassify its drivers as employees eligible for broad benefits. Uber shares lost 4.2% Wednesday.</p><p>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.</p><p>JPM -1.6%</p><p>A yearlong reprieve for Wall Street is coming to an end. The Federal Reserve said Friday that it would not extend emergency relief that eased capital requirements for big banks during the pandemic, putting pressure on bank stocks. The reprieve temporarily excluded one-year Treasurys and deposits held at the central bank from banks' supplementary leverage ratio calculation, allowing banks to replace their stockpiles of safe assets with loans to cash-strapped borrowers. Banks had pressed for an extension. JPMorgan Chase shares fell 1.6% Friday.</p>",
