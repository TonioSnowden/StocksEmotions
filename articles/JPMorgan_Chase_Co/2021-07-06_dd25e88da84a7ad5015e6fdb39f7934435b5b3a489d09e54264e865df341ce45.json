  "title": "FirstFT: JPMorgan Chase buying spree is Jamie Dimon's busiest in years",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase has made more than 30 acquisitions in 2021, putting America's biggest bank by assets on track for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d54b3a-b1e9-4f99-8ebd-3ec84a3ca1e5\">its largest buying spree</a> in years.</p> <p>The acquisitions, mostly of smaller companies ranging from an online money manager in Britain to a Brazilian digital bank, are a sign of how JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon is turning to deals to expand the banking giant.</p> <p>The bank has done 33 deals so far in 2021, according to data from Refinitiv, with nine deals alone in June. The purchase of OpenInvest, a platform that allows customers to customise a portfolio based on environmental, social and governance metrics, and a minority stake in the Brazilian digital bank C6 are the most recent.</p> <p>“It's a string of pearls approach where they buy smaller fintech firms to better advance the asset management business with lower cultural, operating and goodwill hurdles than come with a large acquisition,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. KKR steps up pursuit of UK companies</strong> The US private equity group with $367bn in assets is about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5cc18cf-081d-4b68-b469-ca77935a615e\">to set up a new team of five dealmakers</a> in London to focus on buying British companies, the head of its European buyouts business said in an interview with the Financial Times. Private equity groups have been in hot pursuit of UK companies this year, with supermarket group Wm Morrison <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfa13952-6b97-4711-b754-5d54150ae724\">the latest example</a>. </p> <p><strong>2. Oil hits three-year high</strong> Oil prices rose to their highest level since 2018 after Opec and its allies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9746fbc-7a90-4c9a-9a52-30b44475aa9a\">abandoned a decision</a> on increasing oil production as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the UAE struggled to reach a compromise.&#xa0;Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, rose to $77.09 a barrel after the meeting broke up without a deal. US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, hit $76.20 a barrel.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>More energy news </strong>Mexico has awarded control of one of the country's biggest oil discoveries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ee90e5a-c9e4-4f11-b8c1-d1e57bd39a4b\">to state-owned Pemex</a>, a blow to private investment that could prompt international litigation.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>3. EU global tax deal wrangle </strong>Brussels is working to <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/e51c4a7b-a64d-40e5-b45c-e53ebdf284fe\">overcome resistance</a> from three member states to last week's international agreement to rewrite corporate tax rules, with Hungary and Estonia arguing that the proposal may even break EU law.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>let us not be too curmudgeonly — the&#xa0;agreement&#xa0;to reform international corporate taxation is a big moment, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17de8ec7-f4c8-4ed0-9570-bb1b732add85\">writes Martin Sandbu</a>.

Didi's shares, which have not traded since Friday, fell about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00403ae5-7565-413e-907d-ad46549375ba\">25 per cent in pre-market trading</a> today.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>In other China tech news</strong> A co-ordinated attempt by Chinese tech companies to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c79a5f6a-0827-47a4-9b3b-622a81fcc75a\">circumvent Apple's privacy policies</a> has been forestalled.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>5.
