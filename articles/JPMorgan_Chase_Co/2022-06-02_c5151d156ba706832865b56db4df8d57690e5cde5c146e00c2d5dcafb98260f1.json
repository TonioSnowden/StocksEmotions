  "title": "Saudi Oil Boost, Yemen Truce Set Stage for Biden Visit to Kingdom; The partners known as OPEC+ plan a bigger-than-expected production increase of 648,000 barrels a day in July and August",
  "text": "<p>Both moves were sought by the U.S. and helped set the stage for Mr. Biden to visit Saudi Arabia later this month as the president looks to set aside longstanding divisions with the kingdom amid high oil and gasoline prices that have driven inflation. While the visit hasn't been announced, Thursday's moves create momentum for the president's trip.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his aides quickly praised the moves by Saudi Arabia, another sign that the two sides are moving to end longstanding tensions that have brought relations to a low point. There had been a flurry of diplomacy between Washington and Riyadh, with senior U.S. officials traveling to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.</p><p>\"This truce [in Yemen] also would not have been possible without cooperative diplomacy from across the region,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Saudi Arabia demonstrated courageous leadership by taking initiatives early on to endorse and implement terms of the U.N.-led truce.\"</p><p>Dan Shapiro, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who now serves as a distinguished fellow in the Atlantic Council's Middle East programs, said the moves are a clear sign the president is poised to visit Saudi Arabia.</p><p>\"It sounds like things are falling into place,\" he said. \"These are the elements that they needed. Biden could only go if he got commitments from Saudis on oil production and broader issues.\"</p><p>A decision to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would mark a reversal for Mr. Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Saudi Arabia for its human-rights record and for the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As a candidate in 2020, Mr. Biden said he would \"make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. There's very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.\"</p><p>Some fellow Democrats have urged Mr. Biden to maintain a tough line on Saudi Arabia because of human-rights concerns, and because they would rather the U.S. move away from its reliance on fossil fuels rather than make ethically questionable compromises to get more oil from the Saudi regime.</p><p>The moves on oil represent a shift for the Saudis, who had resisted calls from the U.S., U.K. and other Western countries to pump more oil with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to help reduce a price boom resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>At a meeting Thursday between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC producers led by Russia, the group agreed to raise output by 648,000 barrels a day in July and in August, OPEC delegates said. Until now, the OPEC coalition, called OPEC+, had been dedicated to a series of monthly output increases of about 400,000 barrels a day that have done nothing to stop oil prices from surging above $100 a barrel since the Feb. 24 invasion.</p><p>The OPEC+ decision came days after the European Union agreed to impose a partial ban on Russian oil purchases, adding to Western sanctions that have helped push Russian crude production down by 700,000 barrels a day in the past two months. While Russian exports have held up over that time, some OPEC officials believe it will be difficult for Russia to keep pumping at the same level after the EU move.</p><p>Russia is one of the world's three largest oil producers, along with Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Before the invasion, it pumped 11.3 million barrels a day, about 11% of global supplies.</p><p>There were signs that the oil market didn't believe the new output plan would make a meaningful difference with Russian output falling. Brent crude prices rose after the output increase was announced, trading up about 0.33% at $116.70 a barrel on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Christyan Malek, head of oil and gas at JPMorgan, said the agreement was unlikely to bring significantly more oil production from the group.</p><p>\"It's like the group is firing rubber bullets at the oil market,\" he said. \"It's a cosmetic increase.\"</p><p>Further undercutting confidence in the plan: The agreement assumes Russia will increase its output by 170,000 barrels a day from July, though its output is falling.</p><p>According to Persian Gulf officials familiar with the discussions, the Saudis would consider increasing their oil output more than planned if Russian output continues to decline. Their decision would also depend on Mr. Biden's potential visit to the Middle East at the end of this month, which could include his first meeting with Prince Mohammed, the officials said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and another major Gulf OPEC producer, the United Arab Emirates, say they want Washington to beef up their security after a string of attacks by Yemeni rebels and threats by Iran.</p><p>Increasing Saudi oil production has been a central element in talks about a possible visit by Mr. Biden to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Late last month, two senior Biden administration officials—White House adviser Brett McGurk and State Department energy envoy Amos Hochstein—flew to Saudi Arabia to try to hammer out a series of agreements to help repair strained relations between the two countries. Prince Khalid bin Salman, the crown prince's younger brother who serves as deputy defense minister, also flew to Washington to discuss the issues.</p><p>Relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have been strained since Mr. Biden took office with a vow to treat Saudi Arabia and its young crown prince as pariahs because of their unpopular war in Yemen against Iran-backed Houthi forces and the killing of Mr. Khashoggi by a Saudi hit team that U.S. intelligence officials concluded was sent by Prince Mohammed. The crown prince has denied involvement in Mr. Khashoggi's killing but said he bears ultimate responsibility as the kingdom's leader.</p><p>Mr. McGurk and other White House officials have been trying to broker a rapprochement between Mr. Biden and Prince Mohammed so that the two could meet later this month in Saudi Arabia. But the talks have yet to produce an agreement that satisfies leaders in both nations, according to people involved in the talks.</p><p>Russia has rushed to keep alive an oil alliance that it struck in 2016 with the Saudis and OPEC. The resulting OPEC+ coalition controls over half the world's oil production, giving Moscow sway over crude prices.</p><p>In the days before the Ukraine invasion and since, Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken multiple times with Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto leader, each time releasing a statement lauding the importance of OPEC+.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Riyadh this week and met with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, calling OPEC+ \"important and relevant.\" His remarks followed a report in The Wall Street Journal that OPEC+ was considering exempting Russia from its output targets as its production waned.</p><p>That last OPEC+ agreement was struck in May 2021, with the group deciding to increase its output by about 432,000 barrels a day each month for a year, gradually bringing its output back to prepandemic levels. The group cut output in 2020 when global demand fell during the initial economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Under the OPEC+ deal, Moscow is supposed to increase its output by 114,000 barrels a day. But its output is expected to fall by about 8% this year.</p><p>Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com</p><p>Saudi Oil Boost, Yemen Truce Set Stage for Biden Visit to Kingdom</p>",
