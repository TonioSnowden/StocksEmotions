  "text": "<p>JPMorgan denied the allegations in the lawsuit, which was filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.</p><p>\"It is very unfortunate when losses occur with any of our clients as a result of a breakdown of a client's own internal controls, and Essilor has acknowledged publicly that colluding employees successfully circumvented the company's internal controls to submit, approve and confirm the fraudulent payment orders,\" the bank said.</p><p>Essilor disclosed the theft in late 2019, saying it would take a loss. In the lawsuit, the company said an employee at its Thailand plant managed to fake authorization of 243 payments to shell companies scattered across Asia. The company has recovered about $100 million of the stolen funds, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Essilor accused JPMorgan of failing to monitor the account properly and said it should have noticed a series of changes from its normal behavior.</p><p>For instance, the volume of transactions and dollars moving out of the New York account suddenly skyrocketed to more than $140 million from about $15 million a month. The individual transactions were all done in round numbers, without cents, and authorizations took less than a minute instead of hours, the lawsuit said.</p><p>The money was sent to shell companies with names such as Guangzhou Wendy Hair Products or Citgo Oil Trading LLC, signaling they weren't in the eye-care business, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Essilor is seeking a trial for an unspecified amount of damages from the bank.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Ray-Ban Maker Sues JPMorgan, Accusing It of Failing to Catch $272 Million Theft</p>",
