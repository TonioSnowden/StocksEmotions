  "title": "U.S. News: Black Voters Weigh Broad Mix of Issues",
  "text": "<p>In the final stretch of midterm campaigning, Democrats are trying to boost turnout among Black voters, a core constituency of the party, by touting the outsize economic gains Black Americans have made since the downturn early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans are arguing that elevated inflation has left all Americans worse off financially, with steep price increases for items such as food, gasoline and shelter.</p><p>How much either message helps decide tight races this fall will in part depend on how Black voters weigh competing priorities.</p><p>Interviews with Black voters and recent public polling suggest that the issues that will determine how and if they vote are more varied than the economic woes that are preoccupying the broader electorate. Many Black Americans rate healthcare, education and public safety as nearly as important in influencing their vote as the economy and rising costs.</p><p>Black voters make up roughly one-third of the electorate in Georgia, according to the Pew Research Center, and will be especially important to Democrats in the state this fall. Georgia is home to marquee races for governor and the U.S. Senate, making this electorate crucial to Democrats' hopes for keeping control of the chamber.</p><p>An October Quinnipiac University poll of likely Georgia voters showed 21% of Black voters viewed inflation as the most urgent issue facing Georgia, followed by gun violence at 19% and abortion at 17%.</p><p>Other surveys also showed Black Americans have broader concerns than the overall electorate heading into voting. An August survey by The Wall Street Journal showed that, generally speaking, Black Americans nationwide were more likely than all voters to say issues such as gun violence and the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade made them more likely to vote this fall.</p><p>The Biden administration has credited its policies, such as its vaccine rollout and the expanded child tax credit during 2021, for helping drive Black Americans' economic gains from the brief, sharp pandemic-induced recession in 2020. The unemployment rate for Black Americans fell to 5.8% in September, according to the Labor Department. That was well down from near 17% early in the pandemic and only slightly above record lows set in 2019, although still higher than the overall unemployment rate of 3.5%.</p><p>After the 2007-09 recession, it took more than six years for the Black unemployment rate to fall to 8.5%, where it was just before the start of that downturn.</p><p>Other metrics show Black Americans' gains in the labor market are outpacing those of the overall population. Additionally, research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that Black households experienced more income growth than other racial groups between 2019 and 2021, on an inflation-adjusted basis.</p><p>\"African-Americans saw more gains in this recovery,\" said Cecilia Rouse, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \"Our focus is on ensuring that we continue to make that kind of progress.\"</p><p>Still, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that Black Americans, along with Latino Americans, are facing higher inflation than the national average, likely because those groups spend a greater proportion of their income on items, such as transportation and housing, that have experienced particularly steep price increases.</p>",
