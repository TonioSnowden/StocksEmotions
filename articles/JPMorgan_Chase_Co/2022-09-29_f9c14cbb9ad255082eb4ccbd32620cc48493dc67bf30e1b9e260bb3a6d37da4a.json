  "title": "CFPB Fines Regions  For Overdraft Fees  ----  By Peter Rudegeair",
  "text": "<p>    Regions Financial Corp. agreed to pay $191 million to settle a regulator's accusations that it charged surprise overdraft fees that harmed its customers. </p><p>   A review from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that, between August 2018 and July 2021, the bank charged customers overdraft fees on debit-card purchases and ATM withdrawals even though they had sufficient funds in their accounts at the time those transactions were authorized. </p><p>   The CFPB said Regions employed \"counterintuitive, complex transaction processing\" that made it hard for consumers to understand or reasonably avoid paying fees. </p><p>   Regions, based in Birmingham, Ala., will pay a $50 million penalty to the CFPB and will refund customers around $141 million for these so-called authorized-positive overdraft fees. </p><p>   The bank didn't admit or deny the CFPB's findings as part of the settlement. </p><p>   Regions said in an email that it disagreed with the CFPB's characterizations but that it is pleased to move forward. </p><p>   Under the Biden administration, the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have pressed banks to cut back on overdraft charges. </p><p>   Following scrutiny from regulators and politicians, banks including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. made changes to their overdraft practices. </p><p>   Black households and those with low to moderate incomes are almost twice as likely to incur overdraft fees as white households or those with higher incomes, according to a report from the Financial Health Network, a research firm partly funded by financial institutions. </p><p></p>",
