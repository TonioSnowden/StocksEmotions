  "title": "Easy Markets Access Has Risks --- GameStop mania was the wrong way to 'democratize' finance",
  "text": "<p>On Monday, GameStop closed at $60, 88% below its peak on Jan. 28. Other companies recently targeted by individual investors online, such as AMC and BlackBerry, also deflated. The Treasury Department concluded on Thursday that \"the core [market] infrastructure was resilient.\"</p><p>The real fallout may be to come. Officials are investigating financial misconduct, particularly by brokerage firms that restricted purchases of some stocks last week. Politicians lamented that professional speculators were protected at the expense of small traders. Brokers said they only took action because of risk limits imposed by clearing firms.</p><p>An explicit goal of Reddit gamblers was to torpedo hedge funds' short bets, which they see as fraudulent manipulation by a Wall Street cabal. Yet trades by the Reddit gang ended up benefiting many asset managers, including hedge funds. But focusing on whether amateur or professional investors won or lost more in the GameStop saga risks missing the point. Most asset managers make their money through fees.</p><p>The S&amp;P Dow Jones SPIVA index, which tracks active funds, shows 78% of large active funds in the U.S. underperformed the S&amp;P 500 over five years. Hedge funds' access to shorting and other complex trades doesn't appear to give them an edge: The Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index returned 65% over the past decade, compared with 250% for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Savers are fleeing to cheaper services. Over 90% of 2020 net fund flows went into index-tracker funds, according to data provider Morningstar. E-traders such as TD Ameritrade and E*Trade have been reducing fees for years. Fintech players like Robinhood, launched to \"democratize finance,\" helped usher in commission-free trading.</p><p>That can be great for investors, but it forces companies to find other revenue sources, potentially creating conflicts of interest. Brokerages earn a lot of money by charging wholesalers to direct orders their way -- a practice now under scrutiny. More worryingly, it led to a surge in trading volumes by individual investors, and pushed them to dabble in derivatives like options.</p><p>Research overwhelmingly shows that day traders tend to lose relative to more patient holders. From January 2000 to December 2019, investors who missed out on the best 20 days of the S&amp;P 500 made zero returns, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>Robinhood and other brokers are partially responsible for tripping up their clients, by allowing easy access to leveraged trades only to stop the party when their own -- insufficient -- resources got stretched.</p><p>Low fees are good, but not when accompanied by opaque pricing practices, overly loose capital requirements for brokers or giving individual investors access to complex products without suitability requirements. If people lose too much money on their \"free\" trades, a backlash could prompt changes that give power back to middlemen.</p><p>\"Democratizing\" finance should be about allowing small savers to invest their money without being ripped off. Enabling full-on gambling undermines that very goal.</p>",
