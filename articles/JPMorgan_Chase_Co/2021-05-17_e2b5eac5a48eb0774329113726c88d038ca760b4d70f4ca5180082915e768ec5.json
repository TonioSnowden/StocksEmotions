Pubs, cafés and restaurants in England were allowed to serve customers indoors, limited foreign travel was legalised and cultural venues and sports stadiums could lift their shutters, moves mirrored in some of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69f0c3b8-00ff-4065-a482-ebe00c6a890a\">EU's biggest countries</a>.</p> <p>The reopenings mean many staff in the hospitality sector are now back in their workplaces, but for office employees the great return is still in its early stages, with companies divided over how to reorganise their workforces in light of the changes wrought by the pandemic.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">financial services</a>, views differ on either side of the Atlantic. JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon wants American bankers back at their desks as soon as possible while Société Générale boss Frédéric Oudéa has dismissed as outdated “the idea that winning is just about spending 22 hours during the day at the office”. Others, such as accountancy firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce81651a-7451-4781-a9b8-85c96f2c5be0\">BDO</a>, say they are happy to let staff work wherever they want.&#xa0;</p> <p>But what happens if “hybrid” workers only want to come in Tuesdays to Thursdays? Do companies need to hire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfa740a3-2a60-4f11-aadc-95feed1e5a8c\">celebrity chefs</a> to tempt them back on Mondays and Fridays? And what is the effect of homeworking on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97ae3bb7-2ae4-40c1-a261-00616385770b\">productivity?</a></p> <p>Whether workers will even have the choice of commuting to an office is also moot. Our Big Read takes stock of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6b8d468-e339-497d-b165-0de10bcddcae\">commercial property</a> market, with many buildings lying empty and big employers having outlined intentions to shrink their requirements for floor space.&#xa0;</p> <p>As columnist Emma Jacobs writes today, the shift to working from home also risks creating a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c113f86b-fbe3-4ed4-b39a-359ad57d72b8\">two-tier workforce</a>, with fewer development opportunities for those working remotely to network with colleagues, especially women with caring responsibilities.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The onus is on management to prevent the forming of new cliques that foster discrimination, she says. Or as one academic explains: “We may not have tonnes of data on the disparate impact of hybrid policies on underprivileged groups, but it is naive to assume it won't happen. The big question is how to mitigate it.”</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>The EU is pushing to expand <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a47c7e-0b00-4e31-92ab-cd3ff0b9070b\">vaccine manufacturing</a> in <strong>Africa</strong>, a move the bloc believes will be more beneficial for poorer nations than the drug patent waivers proposed by the US. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2a75e02-e2db-444a-be15-6a0af2b04527\">Ayoade Alakija</a>, co-chair of the Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance, writes in the FT on the need for the continent to become self-sufficient in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine production. “No one will help us if we do not attempt to help ourselves. It is time to stop feeding off the scraps from the table of high-income countries,” she says.</p> <p>Increasing unrest in <strong>Colombia</strong> over government remedies for a pandemic-induced recession and one of the world's longest lockdowns could spill over into the rest of the region, writes Latin America editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/998a4ba0-dc7b-4cac-b831-50f64ca58bbf\">Michael Stott</a>. In <strong>Brazil</strong>, a power struggle between President <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bc8f805-629d-4223-a051-716204add20e\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> and the Supreme Court over pandemic policy is deepening. </p> <p>Tea harvests at plantations in <strong>India</strong>, the world's second-largest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/585c8ad7-e1c2-4c88-9087-16d877a1c185\">tea producer </a>after China, are under threat from the double hit of Covid infections and drought. A leading <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cc9e5e2-0d39-4e27-b268-4945af44dea6\">Indian scientist</a> has quit the government's task force as rows have deepened over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's handling of the pandemic, which, according to official figures, has led to more than 40,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths a day.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>JD Logistics</strong>, the delivery arm of Chinese ecommerce group JD.com, is looking to raise up to £$3.4bn in what could be one of Hong Kong's largest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb5f4313-fb32-4ce5-9424-51dc6169a9ef\">initial public offerings</a> this year and the latest sign of the rise of online shopping. Indonesia's two biggest start-ups are merging to create ecommerce group <strong>GoTo</strong>, with a potential stock market value of $40bn. Our future of retail series continues with a look at how the pandemic is driving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f59ceebe-f7ca-4f8c-9ecc-e7979b3de5fa\">ecommerce</a> forward in <strong>Japan</strong> after a slow start. </p> <p><strong>Ryanair</strong>, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, reported its biggest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37277011-174d-4927-93fa-d3058533cd2e\">annual loss of €815m</a> after enduring an 80 per cent drop in passengers during the pandemic, a crisis also discussed in our latest “How to Lead” interview featuring <strong>Dublin Airport</strong> boss Dalton Philips. The EU could this week allow member states to follow <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94991706-c252-4b77-9047-943251fbe702\">Portugal </a>— one of the countries most dependent on <strong>tourism</strong>, which accounts for 17&#xa0;per cent national output&#xa0;and 19&#xa0;per cent&#xa0;of&#xa0;jobs — and allow entry to UK visitors. <strong>Greece</strong> is leading the way on mechanisms for safe travel ahead of the EU's digital “green certificate”, reports our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90a3e0a9-450c-42fd-828a-b49346eb7f71\">Europe Express</a> newsletter.</p> <p>Drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> signalled it was back in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53062063-2485-4c41-bb66-a25a82fe0351\">vaccine race</a> after publishing promising trial results with partner Sanofi. The company, which has been under investor pressure to beef up its drugs pipeline, is talking to governments about new manufacturing facilities and investing heavily in messenger RNA, the technology behind the successful vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>The plunge in government <strong>bond yields</strong> caused by the pandemic is leading central banks to hunt out new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5dc1665b-c34c-4497-9ccb-ba1f630d44fd\">riskier assets</a>, including corporate bonds, emerging market bonds and equities. Managers of foreign currency reserves are typically highly risk-averse but with more than $12tn in cash to play with, they have huge influence on markets. </p> <p>Panic over inflation is just the latest sign of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/931a6091-a5cf-4a00-bddb-fdf8fe493e6e\">investor overreaction</a>, writes US financial editor Robert Armstrong in the first edition of <strong>Unhedged</strong>, our new markets newsletter. “Get used to weeks like last week. It's gonna be a weird couple of years,” he writes. <em>What better time to</em> <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=584573e552860d000491cdb8\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> and get Unhedged in your inbox each weekday morning?</em></p> <p>Interest in <strong>gold</strong> as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c241565-1d48-46ac-83b2-74ec92c09e44\">haven asset</a> is growing again as investors get spooked by the growth in Covid cases in Asia and the Caribbean and the new panic over inflation, leading to last week becoming the worst for global stocks since late February. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>H. Ickx comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2978026-4bc2-439c-a561-a1972eeba940?commentID=2ab229ee-8de7-429f-bece-787c1d83a799\">How mRNA became a vaccine game-changer</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Real human progress cannot be achieved by short-term capitalist markers solely. It has required loads of public money and, especially, patience to eventually get the result we see now. A healthy tax on private profits is only just and desirable, as all private profits rely on the past and present efforts of the entire society. Also mind, worldwide there are now many scientists doing research that might not show any concrete result any time soon, maybe never. Or maybe their work will be picked up only decades from now. They are not losers — their work is all fundamental to our progress.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>Project runway: As international travel slowly comes back to life, How To Spend It magazine celebrates 50 years of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb9e6dae-ce3e-4319-92a7-244b4997e3b1\">airport fashion</a>. </p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Return to the office beckons' FT.com 17 May.
