  "text": "<p>Nurix has attracted corporate interest because of its capabilities, such as degrading specific disease-causing proteins. Brisbane, Calif.-based Nitrase also has a technology platform that Dr. Beaurang says should interest pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>Nitrase says it has identified a new class of enzymes, nitrases, that affect the activity and functions of proteins and could be good drug targets for various diseases. Nitrase—which has just changed its name from Nitrome Biosciences—is developing its own drug pipeline, including an early-stage Parkinson's treatment, but partnerships will help it explore the potential of these drug targets further, according to Dr. Beaurang.</p><p>Instead of striking several small deals, Nitrase will pursue a few large ones. When both sides are heavily invested, the deal leads to better science, better outcomes and relationships between the companies, he said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Crypto regulations. The Biden administration on Monday took the first significant step to impose banklike oversight on the cryptocurrency companies involved in the issuance of stablecoins, outlining a process that could shape the future of that digital money, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p><p>A Treasury-led panel recommended that Congress impose a new regulatory framework around stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to national currencies like the U.S. dollar—and limit the issuance of such digital assets to banks. The legislative request is a tall order given both chambers of Congress are narrowly divided.</p><p>In the absence of congressional action, the panel recommended that a broader group of regulators charged with detecting risks to the financial system—the Financial Stability Oversight Council—consider whether to designate certain stablecoin activities as systemically important. Such a process could ultimately lead to the Federal Reserve writing more-stringent risk-management standards for stablecoin companies.</p><p>Rivian Automotive Targets IPO Valuation Just Above $60 Billion</p><p>Rivian Automotive Inc. is seeking a valuation in a range just above $60 billion in its initial public offering next week, one of the biggest and most-anticipated deals yet in a blockbuster year for new issues, The Wall Street Journal reports. The Amazon.com Inc. -backed electric-vehicle startup plans to sell shares between $57 and $62 apiece, the company said in an updated regulatory filing on Monday.

The roadshow for company management and their underwriters to pitch the shares to potential investors begins Tuesday, and the shares are to start trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market next week under the symbol RIVN.</p><p>Edison Partners Leads Investment in Prepaid Technologies</p><p>Growth-equity firm Edison Partners has led a $96 million funding round for digital payment business Prepaid Technologies Co., a bet on the continued growth in the sector, WSJ Pro reports.
