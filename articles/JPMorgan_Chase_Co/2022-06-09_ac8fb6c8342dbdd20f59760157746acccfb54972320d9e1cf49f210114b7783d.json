  "text": "<p>\"It's been one kink after another this year, and worst of all, demand doesn't seem to be responding to the surge in gas prices, meaning there is a high probability that prices could go even higher in the weeks ahead,\" said Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis. The average price edged down to $4.98 later in the day Thursday, according to GasBuddy's real time ticking average. But that's just a snapshot in time.</p><p>AAA's national average on Thursday stood at $4.97, but a spokesman told MarketWatch the organization expects the average to reach the $5 mark over the weekend. There are almost 20 states where gas costs at least $5/gallon, AAA data shows.</p><p>It all comes a day before another reminder of the high cost of living these days.</p><p>On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release May inflation dataand analysts are predicting a 0.7% monthly rise in costs on consumer goods and services. In April, the year-over-year inflation rate was 8.3%, a slight decline from a month earlier, but still at steamy four-decade highs.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX and the Nasdaq Composite COMP all finished sharply lower Thursday with investors sweating over Friday's forthcoming inflation data.</p><p>When it comes to gas prices, increased seasonal demand is on a crash course with high-priced oil, the biggest factor in prices. The economic consequences of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine have trimmed back global supply in a time of rising demand, GasBuddy noted. Diminished refining capacity has also ratcheted up the costs, it added.</p><p>At this point, the global economy is in a 'critical situation,' according to some observers.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery closed Thursday at $121.51 a barrel.</p><p>Of course, gas priced at least $5/gallon has been a reality in many states already, starting with California. Drivers in the Golden State are currently paying $6.39/gallon, according to GasBuddy data. The rest of America could be paying those prices in a matter of months, with JP Morgan JPM analysts predicting$6 averages by the end of August.</p><p>But the $5 mark may carry extra psychological weight, some previous surveys have suggested. That's the price point where drivers increasingly take steps to scale back their driving habits.</p><p>The question will be to what extent hot inflation and high gas prices will melt away summer travel and recreation plans as Americans try to leave the pandemic behind.</p><p>\"It's a perfect storm of factors all aligning to create a rare environment of rapid price hikes,\" De Haan said in a Thursday statement. \"The situation could become even worse should there be any unexpected issues at the nation's refineries or a major hurricane that impacts oil production or refineries this summer.\"</p><p>Guess what? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationis bracing for an \"above-normal\" hurricane season this year.</p><p>The national average gas price has hit $5 per gallon and there's 'a high probability that prices could go even higher,' GasBuddy says</p>",
