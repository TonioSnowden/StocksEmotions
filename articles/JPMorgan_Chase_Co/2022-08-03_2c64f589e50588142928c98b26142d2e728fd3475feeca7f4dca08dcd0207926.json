  "title": "OPEC, Allies Agree to Modest Increase in Oil Production; Alliance to raise output by 100,000 barrels a day in September, following calls by the U.S., other major consumers for more supply",
  "text": "<p>In their sixth meeting since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, sending oil prices above $100 a barrel for the first time in eight years, members of the broader alliance, called OPEC+, agreed to raise their collective production by 100,000 barrels a day in September, delegates said.</p><p>The alliance in June had agreed to boost output by 648,000 barrels a day in July and in August. Before that, OPEC+ rolled out monthly increases of 432,000 barrels a day as part of a plan agreed on last year to raise output to prepandemic levels. That deal ends in August, although many members are producing below their allotted quotas. Members will continue to coordinate on oil production at least until the end of the year, delegates said after Wednesday's meeting.</p><p>Oil prices, which soared as Covid-19 lockdowns eased and economic activity picked back up, have slipped in recent weeks on worries about global growth. The drop has erased most of the gains after Russia's invasion.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 3.4% at $97.13 a barrel on Wednesday, while U.S. crude was 3.7% lower at $90.97.</p><p>The U.S. and other major oil-consuming Western nations have called on the alliance, which accounts for about half the world's oil production, to pump more crude to help bring prices down. Russia prefers higher prices to make up for lost exports due to Ukraine-related sanctions.</p><p>While noting that energy prices have come down in recent weeks, a senior Biden administration official said the president will continue to push at home and abroad to ensure that energy supply meets demand and to keep gasoline prices low.</p><p>Mr. Biden was under pressure at home after gasoline prices hit a record, posing a threat to Democrats in the coming midterm elections. Gasoline prices have now fallen for seven straight weeks and are approaching an average price of $4 a gallon in the U.S. amid shrinking global demand for oil.</p><p>Amos Hochstein, the State Department official in charge of energy security, last month said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that he was confident Gulf producers would increase oil output after Mr. Biden's visit to the kingdom.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Hochstein, who was part of Mr. Biden's delegation to Saudi Arabia, told CNBC that the U.S. would monitor the oil markets to see if the production increase announced by OPEC+ was adequate.</p><p>OPEC delegates say the alliance needs more time to assess a possible slowdown in global energy demand before taking a call on boosting oil production by a significant amount. Saudi officials have sought to temper expectations, reiterating that the kingdom would do what is needed to balance the market if there is a shortage of supply.</p><p>Even then, the alliance's ability to boost output remains limited. OPEC+ pumped nearly 3 million barrels a day less than its collective production target of about 42 million barrels a day in May, according to an independent assessment report commissioned by OPEC. The shortfall was due mainly to falling production in sanctions-hit Russia and chronic output problems in Nigeria, Angola and some other countries, according to OPEC delegates.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the member with the biggest spare capacity, is nearing its pumping limit. The kingdom is currently producing about 10.5 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with its oil operations. They say Riyadh would struggle to produce 11 million barrels a day for more than a few months at a stretch and 12 million barrels a day for more than a few weeks.</p><p>Overall, spare capacity is set to almost halve to 1.7 million barrels a day next year, another report commissioned by OPEC said. It will shrink to as little as 400,000 barrels a day in 2024 as producers respond to rising oil demand, it said.</p><p>Wednesday's decision was justified given the \"limited investments in the [oil] sector,\" which has resulted in limited spare capacity, one delegate said.</p><p>OPEC has repeatedly warned that consumers should brace for energy shortages unless the world boosts investment in new oil-and-gas development, in response to increasing calls to limit such spending. Last year, the International Energy Agency, an energy watchdog for richer countries, said investment in new fossil-fuel supply projects must immediately cease if the world is going to slash net carbon emissions to zero by 2050.</p><p>\"Retaining spare capacity to ensure the market has headroom is prudent especially as an energy supercycle takes hold over the coming years,\" said Christyan Malek, head of oil-and-gas research at JPMorgan.</p><p>The alliance's output decision for September comes a day after the Biden administration approved arms sales worth billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The weapons are meant to help defend the two Gulf countries against attacks from the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, but the decision could still face push back from U.S. lawmakers over Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.'s involvement in the war in Yemen.</p><p>John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the arms sale wasn't linked to OPEC's oil production plans.</p><p>Separately, on Tuesday, the United Nations said Yemen's warring parties have agreed to extend an existing truce for two more months amid efforts to reach an expanded peace agreement.</p><p>Mr. Biden's trip to the kingdom was expected to help improve Riyadh's fraying relationship with Washington. But Saudi officials say key irritants remain, including the current U.S. administration's outreach to its longtime adversary Iran. Riyadh also wants advanced U.S. offensive weapons as a counterbalance to Iranian belligerence in the region, and seeks Washington's backing to end the Yemen war in a way that allows it to come out on top.</p><p>Tarini Parti contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com</p><p>OPEC, Allies Agree to Modest Increase in Oil Production</p>",
