  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Larry Fink Says  Company Is Looking  Into Crypto Sector  ----  By Paul Vigna",
  "text": "<p>   BlackRock Inc. is an investor in a $400 million fundraising round for Circle Internet Financial, the crypto-focused company that manages the stablecoin USD Coin. </p><p>   Other investors in the round included Fidelity Investment Inc., Marshall Wace and Fin Capital. </p><p>   Circle has raised $1.1 billion overall, according to Crunchbase. The company is planning to go public through a special-purpose acquisition company later this year. </p><p>   The USD Coin has become the second-largest stablecoin, with about $51 billion in circulation. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to trade on par with national currencies such as the U.S. dollar and backed by matching reserves. </p><p>   During a conference call Wednesday morning, Larry Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, said BlackRock has been working with Circle over the past year as a manager of some of Circle's cash reserves. He said he expects BlackRock eventually to be the primary manager of those reserves. \"We look forward to expanding our relationship,\" he said. </p><p>   BlackRock has over $9 trillion in assets under management. </p><p>   Mr. Fink said the firm is also studying the crypto sector broadly, including assets, stablecoins, permissioned blockchains and \"tokenization,\" where it perceives a benefit to its customers. \"We are increasingly seeing interest from our clients,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Fink's name came up last week during the Miami 2022 bitcoin conference. </p><p>   Peter Thiel, the PayPal Holdings Inc. co-founder who has become a vocal bitcoin booster, delivered a speech in which he advocated developing an \"enemies list\" of people opposed to bitcoin. </p><p>   He singled out Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Warren Buffett, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Mr. Fink. </p><p>   In a letter to investors last month, Mr. Fink said a well-designed digital-money system could cut cross-border costs, improve global-transactions settlements and help cut down money laundering. </p><p></p>",
