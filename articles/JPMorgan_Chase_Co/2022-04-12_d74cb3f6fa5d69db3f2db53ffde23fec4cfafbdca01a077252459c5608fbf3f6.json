  "text": "<p>Biden administration officials have begun reaching out to Capitol Hill to gauge support for Mr. Barr, some of the people said. If he is nominated, Mr. Barr is expected to win the backing of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which would oversee the nomination, one of the people said. Mr. Brown's office didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The White House declined to comment. Mr. Barr, currently the dean of the University of Michigan's public policy school, didn't respond to a request for comment. Politico first reported that Mr. Barr was the leading candidate for the job.</p><p>The Biden administration has struggled to advance its nominees for key financial regulatory posts through the 50-50 Senate.</p><p>Sarah Bloom Raskin, Mr. Biden's first nominee to be the Federal Reserve's vice chairwoman of banking supervision, withdrew from consideration for the job last month. She took herself out of the running after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote in the evenly divided chamber, said he couldn't support Ms. Raskin's nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.</p><p>The banking supervision position plays a key role in overseeing the largest U.S. financial firms including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Mr. Barr last year was a contender to be the Comptroller of the Currency, another top banking post, before skepticism from progressives stymied that bid. The eventual White House choice for that role, Saule Omarova, withdrew in the face of opposition from moderate Democrats.</p><p>Write to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com, Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com</p><p>Former Treasury Official Michael Barr Is Frontrunner for Top Fed Banking Regulator</p>",
