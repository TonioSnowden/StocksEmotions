It's worth noting that unrest is already affecting business in China, including Apple, which has seen violent clashes at one of its facilities in Zhengzhou,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p><p>Concerns about global growth were helping to support government bond markets, with the yield on the 2-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y falling 4 basis points to 4.438%.

Revised data on third-quarter gross domestic product is due on Wednesday, along with the Fed studies of regional economies known as the beige book reports.
