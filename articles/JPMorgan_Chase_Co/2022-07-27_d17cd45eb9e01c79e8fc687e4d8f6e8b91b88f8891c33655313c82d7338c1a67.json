(Their tales of woe are available <a href=\"https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175307242280000000014.pdf\">on the docket</a>.)</p> <p>Forty-eight hours later, Voyager's lawyers at <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab23e979-8e71-4d5c-85cd-98572d0aedc0\">clapped back</a>, calling SBF's bid, among other things, “a lowball bid dressed up as white-knight rescue”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The bankruptcy risks descending into an old-fashioned brawl. Kirkland is the pre-eminent restructuring law firm in America, particularly when it comes to private equity blow-ups. </p> <p>But even the Big Law powerhouse, which has vanquished some of the toughest hedge funds on Wall Street, should not belie what the street- fighting, wild-haired, cargo-short-sporting billionaire could become.</p> <p>Beneath SBF's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83bc681a-a0f9-43bb-b627-c6dacae4a0a3\">benevolent exterior</a> lies a calculating investor who rivals Wall Street's most feared activists, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4921cca9-428e-4eb9-8f84-276cee411a9a\">according to Lex</a>.</p> <p>SBF's basic play for Voyager was to buy out its crypto for cash at “fair market value”. Customers could choose to access their share of that cash quickly — but only if they signed up for an account at SBF's crypto exchange, <strong>FTX</strong>. </p> <p>Kirkland's gripes with the bid were numerous, but it especially didn't appreciate SBF trying to circumvent the official Voyager auction that Kirkland was set to run in August (SBF wanted to sign a deal by this weekend).&#xa0;</p> <p>The 30-year-old crypto mogul is repped by <strong>Andrew Dietderich</strong> at <strong>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</strong> — an accomplished and aggressive lawyer himself.</p> <p>SBF is already a major player at Voyager. He owns a tenth of the company's worthless equity and borrowed nearly $400mn from Voyager while also loaning it $75mn, a figure that also might be wiped out. </p> <p>The wild west of cryptoland has collided with the formalistic American bankruptcy system that has its own set of norms and customs. </p> <p>Let's see how SBF plays by those rules.</p> <h1>THG and SoftBank: the end of the affair</h1> <p><strong>SoftBank</strong> has ended its brief love affair with <strong>THG</strong>, the cash-burning purveyor of lipstick and protein powder that calls itself a tech company.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the two sides <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceaa50e7-f0da-48b4-b936-1070e02687ed\">formally terminated</a> an agreement that gave the Japanese company an option to buy a $1.6bn stake in the British ecommerce group's technology division.</p> <p>The writing had been on the wall for a long time. In October, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7466fff9-d827-4902-8e9f-4b61a26201a7\">the FT noted</a> that SoftBank's option was already deeply underwater, with the Japanese group placing a far higher value on THG's<strong> Ingenuity </strong>subsidiary than the entire market capitalisation of its London-listed parent.</p> <p>Then, earlier this year, SoftBank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/197c32a9-cfed-418c-9351-ec8eefe54328\">shuttered</a><strong> SB Northstar </strong>— the internal hedge unit that spearheaded the THG investment — after the division racked up the best part of $6bn in losses in just 18 months.</p> <p>Yet the separation still clearly came as a shock to some: THG's share price fell more than 5 per cent after the announcement to trade at fresh lows.</p> <p>This reflects just how skilfully SoftBank played the London stock market, which had long yearned for a homegrown tech success story.</p> <p>Here's how SoftBank did it: SB Northstar invested $730mn in newly issued THG shares in May 2021, while also agreeing an option to buy a 19.9 per cent stake for $1.6bn in a yet-to-be-created subsidiary that would house THG's Ingenuity technology platform. </p> <p>Many analysts saw the deal as validation of THG's tech prowess. But striking a free option on a then-hypothetical subsidiary had all the hallmarks of a classic trade from Northstar's chief <strong>Akshay Naheta</strong>, the former<strong> Deutsche Bank</strong> trader who also spearheaded SoftBank's complicated investment in fraudulent payments company<strong> Wirecard</strong>. </p> <p>To those familiar with Naheta's previous work, the THG trade looked more like an artful solution to a corporate finance puzzle: how do you still make a company's share price rise even after announcing a massively dilutive equity raise?</p> <p>Nonetheless, THG's cheerleaders in the City clung on to hopes the deal would still be consummated, even as Northstar imploded and THG's share price slid further. </p> <p>As recently as January, equity analysts at <strong>RBC</strong> pointed to several factors suggesting that “SoftBank will not walk away” — ignoring the small detail that the Japanese conglomerate's founder <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> had already announced plans to shutter Northstar.</p> <p>In contrast to Wirecard, where Naheta used the magic of derivatives to cover the downside, SoftBank has taken real losses on THG. The British company's shares are down nearly 90 per cent since the Japanese group invested.</p> <p>The only question now is whether SoftBank will dump its remaining stake in THG. With SoftBank having <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/197c32a9-cfed-418c-9351-ec8eefe54328\">already liquidated</a> the vast majority of Northstar's other positions, there's slim cause for optimism. </p> <h1>3M plays the bankruptcy card</h1> <p>Post-it note maker <strong>3M</strong> is in a sticky situation.</p> <p>The Minnesota-based conglomerate faces a wave of litigation over its military-grade earplugs, which more than 100,000 US military veterans alleged to have damaged their hearing during combat.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/899b56c8-e03e-432e-8cd9-130ec272477f\">lent some insight</a> into its defence strategy.</p> <p>3M revealed this week that it's spinning off its healthcare unit — becoming the latest global multinational to siphon off smaller subsidiaries after similar break-ups at <strong>Kellogg's</strong>, <strong>General Electric </strong>and <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>.</p> <p>Simultaneously, it announced that<strong> Aearo Technologies</strong>, the unit that made the earplugs at the centre of the legal battle, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and set aside $1bn to fund a trust to resolve all claims that were entitled to compensation.</p> <p>(Aearo maintains that its earplugs “were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless face increasing litigation” and that it wanted to “achieve an efficient and equitable resolution” for stakeholders “while reducing the cost and time that could otherwise be required to litigate thousands of cases”.)</p> <p>The healthcare spin-off and the bankruptcy filing could be interpreted as two entirely separate events.</p> <p>Or, as DD ventures to guess, a co-ordinated strategy by 3M to try to put a cap on what could potentially be billions in mounting liabilities. Whatever the mission, it has enlisted some of the biggest names in Big Law to see it through.</p> <p>Just four months ago, 3M hired<strong> Steven Reich</strong>, the former Kirkland partner and US <strong>Justice Department</strong> official who most recently led<strong> Deutsche Bank</strong> through its own set of legal battles, as its chief counsel for enterprise risk management.</p> <p>The company has tapped elite law firm <strong>Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz</strong> to advise on its spin-off, and retained both Kirkland and <strong>White &amp; Case</strong> to oversee Aearo's bankruptcy proceedings.</p> <p>The strategy has shown promise so far. 3M's shares jumped nearly 5 per cent on Tuesday after spending the majority of the year weighed down by the company's litigation woes.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Rolls-Royce</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a8818bc-b33c-4c3a-a5d1-430f2eef5343\">has named</a> former<strong> BP</strong> executive <strong>Tufan Erginbilgic</strong>, currently a private equity partner at <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong>, to succeed <strong>Warren East</strong> as chief executive at the start of next year. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d6f0857-0eae-45db-9025-7f17e82e656c\">More here</a> from Lex.</p></li>  <li><p>The<strong> English Premier League</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36a81042-850a-4b1a-844d-bd7ca1504fca\">has hired</a> outgoing <strong>Whitbread</strong> chief <strong>Alison Brittain </strong>as its new chair.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has named <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> veteran <strong>Enrico Massaro</strong> as head of its consumer and retail group.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Thoma Bravo</strong> has appointed <strong>Donna Riley Bebb</strong> to the newly created role of head of ESG. She was previously head of global credit and ESG at <strong>Google</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Moelis &amp; Company </strong>has hired <strong>John Kimm </strong>as a managing director focused on M&amp;A in New York. He joins from <strong>Evercore</strong>. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Glued to the throne </strong>SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son has a history of falling out with his slated successors. But the thinning list of potential replacements <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/753f5e75-5dee-483f-a718-622aca693d35\">has done little</a> to speed up his search for a successor, the FT's Kana Inagaki writes.</p> <p><strong>Pouyanné's paradox </strong>Despite ploughing billions into clean energy, TotalEnergies' iron-willed chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b6d9d2e-06d3-4b22-b358-eed5df448e65\">is still gunning</a> for a pipeline in Rwanda and other controversial projects.
