The pace of permitting for new housing units also increased in August, up 6% from July and 13.5% from a year ago.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Uber Technologies Inc.&#xa0;UBER rallied nearly 7%, after the ride-sharing company updated its third-quarter outlook following its first months of profitability in adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in July and August.</p><p>Shares of Bill.com Holdings Inc.&#xa0;BILL&#xa0;dropped 3.6%, after the provider of software aimed at simplifying back-office operations announced the offering of $1 billion of common stock to the public and $500 million in convertible debt to qualified institutional investors.</p><p>Transfix Inc., a digital freight platform, said Tuesday it is going public by merging with special-purpose acquisition corporation G Squared Ascend&#xa0;GSQD,&#xa0;+1.55%&#xa0;in a deal with a pro forma enterprise value of $1.1 billion.</p><p>Shares of Activision Blizzard Inc.&#xa0;ATVI&#xa0;were off 0.2% after the company said that it was continuing to address and resolve workplace complaints as it cooperates with&#xa0;a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation&#xa0;into disclosures on employment matters.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;edged up 0.3 basis point to around 1.313% after the benchmark yield saw its biggest rise since Aug. 13, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
