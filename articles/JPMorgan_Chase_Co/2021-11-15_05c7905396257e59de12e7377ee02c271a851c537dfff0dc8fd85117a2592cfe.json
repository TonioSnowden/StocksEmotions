  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>A report today highlights the knock-on effect of UK labour shortages, as employers increase wages to try to hold on to existing workers and attract new ones. </p> <p>More than half of FTSE 100 companies are now paying employees and contractors the voluntary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66d1fc54-6ea6-4a94-b5ea-ce8837f123c7\">“living wage”</a> — which takes into account rising living costs — of £9.90 an hour outside London and £11.05 in the capital, compared with the current statutory minimum of £8.91, rising to £9.50 next April.</p> <p>More than a third of Britain's top bosses in a survey published today said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d2b838c-5ec8-4601-afe6-723905a563d2\">maintaining staff levels</a> was one of their biggest concerns as well as recruiting low-skilled staff from abroad under the UK's new visa regime.</p> <p>The country currently has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/540cb844-3d53-4110-8aa7-526094d6ae83\">more than 1m job vacancies</a>, topped by the health and social care sector with 172,000 posts on offer. Adult social care, where inadequate public funding exacerbates problems of low pay, is particularly badly affected. Mandatory vaccination for care home staff, introduced last week, adds another layer of problems, according to HC-One, the UK's largest care home operator.</p> <p>Next most badly hit is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac6266ed-3977-4d51-88bf-d60768ee8c7a\">hospitality</a>, the UK's third largest private sector employer, with 134,000 vacancies. The industry accounts for 10 per cent of UK employment and 5 per cent of national gross domestic product — although many venues have closed permanently since March last year.</p> <p>The sector remains “in peril” according to the industry's trade body, despite increased spending per customer since pandemic restrictions eased over the summer. Thousands of European workers have left because of Brexit while others have sought work in more stable&#xa0;sectors. And although many were covered by the government's furlough scheme, this did not include tips, leaving many workers with significantly lower earnings.</p> <p>Hospitality and care both face new competition from sectors that have expanded during the pandemic, from public sector programmes such as NHS Test and Trace to transport and logistics — the subject of our new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/future-of-logistics\">Special Report</a> — where the number of jobs advertised has quadrupled from pre-pandemic levels, according to official data.</p> <p>Labour shortages, including the current dearth of HGV drivers, are likely to affect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/030fab86-2b5f-4b65-9a03-d2f5842aeb87\">British supply chains</a> for “a couple of years, assuming that wages increase and more people come into the industry”, according to Andy Prendergast, national secretary at UK trade union GMB. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>“We have to recognise that we have tried to do this on the cheap and we will have to have either higher consumer prices or lower company profits,” he said.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told a parliamentary committee he was very uneasy about inflation and that his decision to keep interest rates on hold had been a very close call (Reuters)</p></li>  <li><p>US coal prices surged to the highest level in more than 12 years as the global power crisis drives up demand for the dirtiest fossil fuel (Bloomberg)</p></li>  <li><p>Prime minister Boris Johnson said the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-59287535?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;ns_linkname=619277151b17f0262dc3f096%26We%20cannot%20afford%20to%20be%20complacent%20-%20PM%262021-11-15T15%3A05%3A50.633Z&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:54255f6b-4b44-4ef4-9d16-6d15db029e85&amp;pinned_post_asset_id=619277151b17f0262dc3f096&amp;pinned_post_type=share\">UK could not be complacent</a> in face of the rise in coronavirus cases in mainland Europe (BBC)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/629686f4-b0db-4b23-853c-26a6fa42c22e\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The UK this week sets out a £1tn <strong>post-Brexit</strong> <strong>export strategy</strong> during an international trade and investment event in London. Prime minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to show the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0d0d443-f8e9-41f7-975c-03732b6c5935\">benefits of leaving the EU</a>, although many companies complain they are being exposed to extra costs and red tape, rather than seeing any practical benefits. A new report contradicts Johnson's view that a “high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity” economy comes from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f29ab60-3e38-499a-ba0b-899646da67c9\">restricting immigration</a>. </p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p><strong>UK power prices</strong> hit their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f17c060-8d82-4192-baa6-e395685595b0\">second highest levels</a> since 2018 today as low wind speeds meant the country had to increase its reliance on gas-fired power plants and burn coal to meet electricity demand.</p> <p>The parties expected to form <strong>Germany's next government</strong> have put forward plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55d6d53e-616e-455c-ab00-f1ec33fdce0b\">tighten curbs on unvaccinated residents</a>, following similar measures in Austria which came into effect today. About 30 per cent of the German population has not been inoculated against Covid-19.</p> <p>Christian Sewing, the boss of <strong>Deutsche</strong>, Germany's largest bank, urged the European Central Bank to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09958ffd-f4c0-4d59-9d0b-fbd5d1e4295a\">tighten monetary policy</a> to tackle surging inflation. “The supposed cure-all of the past years — low interest rates with seemingly stable prices — has lost its effect, now we are struggling with the side effects. Monetary policy must counteract this — and sooner rather than later,” he said. <strong>Tiff Macklem</strong>, governor of the Bank of Canada, argues in the FT that while progress in overcoming the pandemic's effects is faster than expected, central bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44902f21-80fb-47b3-a56d-1356d359b679\">monetary stimulus</a> is still needed. </p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>US Treasury secretary <strong>Janet Yellen </strong>said inflation would remain high until Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/989024a6-b3ff-4acf-9a16-20a93c255db0\">was under control</a>. New data last week showed US consumer prices rising by 6.2 per cent in October from the previous year, its fastest increase since 1990.</p> <p><strong>Japan's economy</strong> shrank in the third quarter as supply chain problems and a resurgent coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cee35138-cc0c-41b1-9968-890d67fa9b23\">hit spending by consumers and businesses</a>. Fumio Kishida, the newly appointed prime minister, is getting ready to launch a stimulus package of cash handouts and subsidies to kickstart Asia's largest advanced economy. <strong>Thailand's economy</strong> has also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/629686f4-b0db-4b23-853c-26a6fa42c22e#post-9efd9e16-536f-4d36-8010-2905e0e709de\">returned to contraction</a>.</p> <p>New home prices in <strong>China</strong> fell for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d923307-8aed-4150-84f6-3ee2faca36dc\">second consecutive month</a> in October. Problems in the property sector — which directly and indirectly accounts for more than a quarter of economic activity in China — also pose risks to the US financial system, the Federal Reserve warned last week. JPMorgan chief <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> today became the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2a61edb-10e9-405c-bd82-26c2651a5c34\">first Wall Street boss</a> to visit greater China during the pandemic.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>Global dividends</strong> for shareholders look set to pass pre-pandemic levels <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ee77fc5-f41c-4a74-9f1d-59e5a110cb0f\">by the end of the year</a>, according to new data. Many companies had cut or suspended payouts in the early days of the crisis to preserve cash.</p> <p>The latest sign that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/990fd080-b9de-4f3f-9c81-3f65baff4eb7\">short-haul airlines</a> were rebounding from the pandemic came with a multibillion-dollar order for <strong>255 Airbus jets</strong> from veteran investor Bill Franke, which will go to carriers such as Europe's Wizz Air and Frontier in the US. Airbus said at the weekend that it expected industry&#xa0;growth to be driven by airlines upgrading older, inefficient aircraft as well as the soaring demand for air cargo.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>Cineworld </strong>surged by up to 15 per cent today as the world's second-largest cinema chain reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22453f49-7594-4882-ba65-625edbe70b1e\">huge rises in demand</a> from movie goers for the latest James Bond flick and other blockbusters.</p> <p><strong>Port operators</strong> were already preparing to adapt to the new generation of mega ships before the pandemic, but the current supply chain squeeze has brought fresh urgency to the need for modernisation. <em>Read this and more in our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/future-of-logistics\"><em>Future of Logistics</em></a><em> report.</em></p> <p>The closure of bars and restaurants during lockdown has been a boon for <strong>wine merchants</strong> as people <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/652b19ad-1724-4f8d-82af-d73b7173ecd1\">switched from plonk to premium tipples</a>. Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, the 320-year old London business, reported a jump in sales and record demand for its collecting services.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>The results are in for the FT survey on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b9af97-3193-4dd6-bcb8-894ba7846e0e\">return to the office</a>, covering your thoughts on everything from hybrid working and its effect on company hierarchies to the commute and inflexible managers. </p> <p>Not all of us have the luxury of being able to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d6f2208-3c32-4226-a87b-8f05a9d8ce6a\">give up our jobs</a> and chase our dreams, says journalist and comedian Viv Groskop. For many people “<strong>The Great Resignation</strong>” has a more literal meaning, she argues: “Being resigned to your fate. Sticking it out. Embracing stoicism.”</p> <p>Even after the disruptive shock of the pandemic, organisations are defaulting to previous <strong>methods of management</strong>, writes the FT's management editor Andrew Hill. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f14b3205-f140-4e74-8743-04b881b63134\">large-scale transformation</a> is still possible, he argues.</p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally...</h1> <p><strong>Watch:</strong> How do you reconcile an ancient institution with modern transparency and modern standards?
