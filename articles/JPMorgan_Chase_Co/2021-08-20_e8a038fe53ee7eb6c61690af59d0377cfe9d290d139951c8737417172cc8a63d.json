  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>Private equity firm<strong> Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> has increased its offer for <strong>Wm Morrison</strong> to 285p per share, in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c55630f-9a8e-447c-8b8f-dabb11c72983\">latest round</a> of a protracted bidding war for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket group that highlights the appeal of British companies to private equity.</p> <h2>Going Dutch: Goldman bulks up in asset management&#xa0;</h2> <p>A €1.6bn deal may not be transformational for a Wall Street titan like <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, but it does indicate the important changes under way.&#xa0;</p> <p>Goldman is buying Dutch insurer<strong> NN Group</strong>'s investment management arm in a purchase which should add $355bn to <strong>Goldman Sachs Asset Management</strong>, per <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">this scoop</a> by the FT's Harriet Agnew and Josh Franklin.</p> <p>It's the bank's largest acquisition since <strong>David Solomon </strong>became chief executive in 2018 and demonstrates the 59-year-old executive's determination to chase fee revenue in areas like asset and wealth management while reducing Goldman's reliance on volatile businesses such as equities and bond trading.</p> <p>The acquisition “helps us scale our asset management platform, particularly by strengthening our position in Europe”, he told the FT, adding that Goldman would “certainly take a serious look” at further acquisitions if they could accelerate its growth.</p> <p>GSAM, which has $2.3tn in assets under supervision, beat Frankfurt-based asset manager <strong>DWS </strong>in the final round of bidding to clinch NN Investment Partners. <strong>UBS Asset Management</strong>, <strong>Janus Henderson</strong> and US insurer <strong>Prudential Financial </strong>had also registered interest.</p> <p>Taking on the fixed-income specialist grants Goldman a strategic foothold in Europe and crucially, steady recurring revenues, as our colleagues at Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ca9bba-75cd-460c-838f-34ecc92a8a4f\">noted</a>.</p> <p>It's the latest deal by a Wall Street bank seeking to increase revenue streams beyond traditional banking services.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> is integrating the chunky acquisitions of trading platform <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/600b1100-53df-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\"><strong>ETrade</strong></a> and US investment manager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/635db026-2e71-4b39-b703-c7233074c84b\"><strong>Eaton Vance</strong></a> — the latter of which created one of the world's biggest asset managers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> is embarking on what could be its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d54b3a-b1e9-4f99-8ebd-3ec84a3ca1e5\">largest buying spree</a> in years, with a series of smaller transactions ranging from the UK online money manager <strong>Nutmeg</strong> to the Brazilian digital bank <strong>C6</strong>.</p> <p>Goldman's asset management division reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fb175d7-fcf2-4d82-be0a-62ec49b6ab27\">record revenue</a> in the second quarter, but only about a quarter of this came from managing assets on behalf of clients — the part of the business it's looking to expand. The bulk of the revenue was generated by investments that Goldman had made with its own capital, a source of income it's trying to shrink. </p> <p>Crucially, Goldman is trying to switch up its strategy at a time when things are going pretty well for its “legacy” franchises. The bank minted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73999cf3-82ed-453d-a30c-e88e55cc8813\">record M&amp;A fees</a> in the second quarter, picking up the slack from a slowdown in the trading division as the market frenzy dies down.</p> <p>Solomon's rivals also believe the time to diversify is now. “I think the banking system is going to be really in tough shape . . . And there will be winners in there, but it won't be all of them,” JPMorgan boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/events/2021/jpmorgan-chase-to-present-at-morgan-stanley-us-financials-conference/ms_financials_conference_finaltranscript.pdf\">predicted</a> several months ago.</p> <h2>The regulatory power struggle behind an $8bn takeover</h2> <p>When EU regulators call in a takeover for an in-depth probe, it's standard practice to hold off and wait for their verdict.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>lllumina</strong>, the San Diego-based genetic sequencing company pursuing an $8bn acquisition of cancer screening start-up <strong>Grail</strong>, has picked an audacious alternative. With Brussels officials off on their summer breaks, it has closed the deal regardless.&#xa0;</p> <p>As put by a veteran lawyer with decades of experience in EU competition law to the FT's Javier Espinoza: “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df9bf7bc-e839-420f-9905-fdfadfeb6bd1\">This is nuts.</a>”</p> <p>EU regulators are concerned that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6913dc65-6bb3-4584-b76e-93e84e732311\">the deal</a> may harm innovation and competition, even if San Francisco-based Grail — backed by <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> and <strong>Bill Gates </strong>— posts no revenues in the bloc.&#xa0;</p> <p>The European Commission is seeking to push the boundaries of its powers by scrutinising such a US-centric deal. But after<strong> Facebook</strong> bought <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>WhatsApp</strong> with relatively little EU scrutiny, even though they are now huge on the continent, regulators are taking a different tack.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US companies fear the EU's investigation will not be done in time for a December deadline to complete the deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>Illumina said it would hold Grail as a separate company while Brussels carries out its probe, in order to “abide by whatever final decision is reached”. It is also challenging the EU's jurisdiction, in a court case due to be heard in Luxembourg this year.</p> <p>Still, the companies risk a multi-million-dollar fine for going ahead without Brussels' blessing, and potentially a few years of legal battles before EU courts.&#xa0;</p> <p>It wouldn't be the first time the EU has fined a company for jumping the gun. In 2009 the commission fined electricity producer <strong>Electrabel</strong> €20m for buying a company without the approval of regulators.</p> <p>Illumina has said that delays to the transaction could disadvantage patients, adding that the deal would let it accelerate the use of Grail's cancer-detecting blood test, thereby potentially saving more lives.&#xa0;</p> <p>It could also be making a calculated decision that the benefits of getting the merger done quickly will outweigh any potential fine.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The revolving door between crypto and its watchdogs</h2> <p>Speaking of regulators, the revolving door between former watchdogs and the industries they oversaw just keeps on turning.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Jay Clayton</strong>, who chaired the US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> from 2017 to 2020, is joining the crypto platform <strong>Fireblocks</strong>' advisory board.&#xa0;</p> <p>He has “always loved the potential efficiencies of this technology”, and thinks that a shift to blockchain use in financial infrastructure is “close to inevitable”, he told the FT's Hannah Murphy and Gary Silverman in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/293ed291-cdac-48a5-b405-6d85c2c05b7c\">interview</a>.</p> <p>Still, during Clayton's time at the SEC, the regulator refused to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, to the chagrin of many in the cryptocurrency world. It also curtailed the initial coin offering market.&#xa0;</p> <p>Since leaving the SEC job, Clayton had already joined the advisory board of crypto asset manager <strong>One River Asset Management</strong>, which has submitted its own bitcoin ETF application. (Outside of crypto, he is <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>'s lead independent director.)&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>He's just the latest financial regulator to move into the crypto economy. In April, the former <strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</strong> head <strong>Christopher Giancarlo</strong> joined the board of the bitcoin lender <strong>BlockFi</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Walmart </strong>has named <strong>Matt Miner</strong>, a former deputy assistant attorney-general during the <strong>Trump</strong> administration and partner at<strong> Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius</strong>, as its chief global ethics and compliance officer.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Former US <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong> associate director <strong>Bryan Schneider</strong> has joined <strong>Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips </strong>as a partner in Chicago.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Fundraising frenzy</strong> Multi-billion-dollar bets by SoftBank and Walmart stoked India's IPO bonanza, with more money raised in listings in the first eight months of this year than in the past three years. That has catapulted India's tech sector on to the global investment stage.

Wall Street bosses, and their regulators, want a better view of what's going on.
