  "title": "Peloton Shares Slide as Losses Mount, Sales Slow; Fitness-equipment maker says it secured $750 million in loans to strengthen balance sheet",
  "text": "<p>Shares fell 12% in morning trading to around $12.42, putting the company on track to close at its lowest level since its 2019 market debut. Before Tuesday's earnings report, the company's shares were down roughly 50% year to date and 92% from its all-time high.</p><p>Investor sentiment on the once-highflying company, like other pandemic winners such as Netflix Inc., Wayfair Inc. and Carvana Co., has soured. At Peloton, investors' question has shifted from how the company could transform fitness to whether it has enough cash to fund its restructuring efforts.</p><p>Peloton, which was worth more than $50 billion at its peak early last year, is now valued at less than $4 billion. Activists have pushed for leadership changes and a potential sale. The co-founders stepped asideand the New York-based company has slashed hundreds of jobs.</p><p>The company said it signed a commitment letter for $750 million in loans payable over five years from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>Chief Executive Barry McCarthy, who took over in February, said Tuesday that the infusion was needed because the company was thinly capitalized and loaded with costly backlogs of unsold bikes and treadmills.</p><p>He said Peloton's dwindling cash reserves were a major surprise as he took over the company. Peloton previously raised more than $1 billionfrom a stock sale.</p><p>\"The nature of turnarounds is that they are full of surprises,\" Mr. McCarthy said. The company warned sales would be lower and losses deeper for the fiscal year ending in June.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy said the company is in talks with outside retailers about selling Peloton equipment, which are currently available only through the company's website or its stores.</p><p>Peloton posted a $757.1 million loss in the quarter ended March 31, which the company attributed to lower customer demand and the cost of carrying inventory of unsold bikes and treadmills. The company's quarterly loss a year ago was $8.6 million.</p><p>\"That inventory has consumed an enormous amount of cash, more than we expected, which has caused us to rethink our capital structure,\" Mr. McCarthy said in a letter to investors announcing the results.</p><p>The company also has been exploring a sale of a sizable minority stake in an effort to shore up its business, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p><p>Revenue fell 24% in the quarter, Peloton's first year-over-year decline since becoming a publicly traded company in 2019. Peloton's subscriber count has increased fourfold since the start of the pandemic to nearly 3 million, but growth has slowed in recent months. The company also said it only saw a modest number of cancellations following its move to increase the subscription fee.</p><p>Peloton last month said it would cut prices of its stationary bikes and treadmills and raise monthly subscriptions for online workout classes starting June 1.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy's predecessor, Peloton co-founder John Foley, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to expand Peloton's manufacturing and supply, betting that demand would hold as the pandemic waned. Along with replacing Mr. Foley, the company made changes to its board and said it would cancel plans for a $400 million factory in Ohio.</p><p>Mr. Foley, a former Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. e-commerce president, is executive chairman of Peloton's board. Earlier this year he sold $50 million worth of Peloton stock to an investment firm backed by computer entrepreneur Michael Dell.</p><p>Now leaving the board is former Barnes &amp; Noble CEO William Lynch, who served as Peloton's president until February, Mr. McCarthy said on a call with analysts. The company initially had said Mr. Lynch would remain on the board.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc., said the new pricing and cost-cutting would improve Peloton profitability in future quarters. The company predicts more losses in the current quarter, which ends June 30 and marks the end of Peloton's fiscal year.</p><p>He has said he plans to create a company more focused on a digital presence and less reliant on sales of exercise equipment. Subscription-based business models tend to generate higher valuations on Wall Street than manufacturers do, and Mr. McCarthy has said he thinks he can apply strategies that worked at Netflix and Spotify to Peloton.</p><p>He said Peloton also will expand testing of a new pricing system in which customers pay a single monthly fee that covers both the stationary bike and a monthly subscription to workout courses. If a customer cancels, Peloton takes back the bike with no charge.</p><p>\"These are not unsolvable problems,\" Mr. McCarthy said on the call with analysts. \"We just have to get our arms around it, fix it, then in 12 months, we'll be in a much better place than we are today.\"</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>Peloton Shares Slide as Losses Mount, Sales Slow</p>",
