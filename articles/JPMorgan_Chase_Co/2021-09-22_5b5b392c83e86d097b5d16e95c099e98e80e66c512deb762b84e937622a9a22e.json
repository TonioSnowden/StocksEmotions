But the company did not comment on exactly when or how much of that amount it would pay, or whether it would meet an $83.5m payment also due on Thursday for an offshore, dollar-denominated note that matures next year. That bond has traded at about 26 cents on the dollar this week, reflecting expectations of imminent default.</p> <p>Concern that the company will default on the offshore bond sparked broader&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/952923b7-f421-407e-b14a-ad2ff190a134\">tumult in global markets</a>&#xa0;this week, with Wall Street on Monday suffering its worst trading day since May.</p> <p>Shares rose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1f2a788-6452-40af-8861-5bf551f04a80\">elsewhere in Asia and in Europe today</a> on hopes that Evergrande might reach a similar arrangement with its international bondholders. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 swung from a loss to a gain following the onshore bond deal's announcement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, funds managed by BlackRock and HSBC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87fddf09-ef69-49b3-87bc-1a2d84fffd91\">added to their holdings</a> of Evergrande bonds months before the liquidity crisis at the Chinese property developer pushed it to the brink of default, the FT reports.</p> <h1>Read more</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Explainer:</strong> What would China's biggest debt restructuring look like?

UK hopes to join US-Mexico-Canada trade pact </strong>British officials said yesterday that the UK was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b519921f-8d14-4948-9afa-f2340b0d25db\">considering applying to join USMCA</a>, the trade pact signed by Donald Trump, as hopes fade for a bilateral agreement with Washington. Meanwhile, Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57c02222-1634-4b88-9b46-0ebd89e89832\">warned</a> Boris Johnson not to allow a dispute over the post-Brexit settlement to destabilise the Northern Ireland peace process at a White House meeting between the two leaders.</p> <p><strong>2. SoftBank backs Steven Mnuchin's private equity fund</strong> Japan's SoftBank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24da1d88-8e63-4868-849f-3e3ecff1c39a\">has followed</a> Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala in backing a new $2.5bn private equity fund set up by the former US Treasury secretary — just eight months after he left office.</p> <p><strong>3. CO2 crisis set to spread to Europe</strong> The UK carbon dioxide shortage threatening industries from steel to food <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/475ca564-66b1-49b7-b6ce-f6f682deeac8\">is spilling over into Europe</a>, Nippon Gases, one of the world's largest distributors of the gas, has warned. It follows comments from the Paris-based IEA yesterday that Russia should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb231586-7214-44af-99c2-b42ee408e206\">send more gas to Europe</a> to help alleviate the energy crisis.</p> <p><strong>4.

DraftKings makes bid to acquire UK rival </strong>The US fantasy sports and sports betting company has made a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/613a232a-5a77-4e58-a3b2-4a3af69af88f\">roughly £16.6bn offer</a> for the UK gambling company Entain, the second time this year a rival has sought to acquire the business.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The Democratic-controlled <strong>House of Representatives</strong> has passed a bill to avert a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fb0614d-ea49-48c6-a6fb-0f7a23dfa2ae\">government shutdown</a>&#xa0;on October 1 and extend the US debt limit until December next year. The proposed legislation, however, is highly unlikely to be approved by the Senate, risking a full-blown fiscal crisis.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>South-east Asian</strong> countries that failed to administer Covid-19 vaccines fast enough are suffering outbreaks of the disease that are causing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2db2b47d-3eaa-4cc0-b933-3c7356e3dbd0\">a growing regional economic divergence</a>, the Asian Development Bank has warned.</p></li>  <li><p>A booster of the <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba108fd5-7541-4c21-b04f-3a55789ce7dd#post-e9211686-d6ed-474b-82f1-778d5b51e582\">increases protection </a>against symptomatic Covid-19 to 94 per cent, the company said yesterday.</p></li>  <li><p>The end of extra federal unemployment benefits for millions of Americans this month is unlikely to provide a significant boost to the US labour market, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d13b204d-a0c0-4eeb-bbfa-a4b0ce1d1c3f\">according to an analysis by the Financial Times</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks to those readers who voted in our </em><a href=\"https://clients.opinary.com/preview/index.html?url=https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times_us/was-joe-biden-right-to-relax-rules-for-i\"><em>latest poll</em></a><em>.

But this trend can serve as a <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/4814a8ca-57a2-43f1-a6da-f126a4254f6d\">roadblock</a> in the push towards greater diversity in corporate America.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“When things are going well you don't want to leave but when things are going poorly you feel you can't leave” — Lloyd Blankfein, former Goldman Sachs chief executive</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Inequality is behind central bank dilemma </strong>There is a worry that persistent price shocks get baked into expectations, which will only be reversed by a period of significantly higher short-term rates. That would cause stagflation, creating devastating problems for weaker borrowers, notably in heavily indebted emerging economies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b65d2c0-251c-467d-b924-42f0c78c3d34\">writes Martin Wolf</a>.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> My colleague Robert Armstrong yesterday interviewed former treasury secretary Larry Summers and well-known academic Nouriel Roubini, and they are both <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8378ca3-9182-4e14-9d54-9d7a213f82b0\">very concerned about inflation</a>. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Decarbonising takes thousands of tiny steps </strong>Stunts and pious pledges won't save the planet, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/1bca616e-3398-4599-8019-8cd688364d9e\">writes Brooke Masters</a>. Manufacturers and retailers must rethink their entire design, manufacturing and sales processes.
