  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is under pressure from investors who accuse it of acting too slowly to address concerns over how it deals with employee harassment and discrimination claims.</p> <p>The Nathan Cummings Foundation has filed a second <a href=\"https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/GS Arbitration resolution 2022 -6a9c3cbc-e007-417d-b7b6-bb4f9e2b18a6.pdf\">shareholder proposal</a> at Goldman asking the bank for a public report on how it uses mandatory arbitration to deal with allegations of harassment and discrimination by its employees. </p> <p>In arbitration, parties go before private mediators to resolve a dispute, rather than to court. Employee advocates argue the process favours companies and silences employees who make allegations of harassment and discrimination.</p> <p>At Goldman's annual meeting in April, 49 per cent of investors — including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco — supported Nathan Cummings' initial proposal requesting Goldman disclose more information about its mandatory arbitration.</p> <p>As a result of the vote, Goldman <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/2021/gs-statement-on-arbitration-policy-review.html\">said in June</a> that it would review its arbitration policy. But the bank has disclosed no progress in six months, said Nathan Cummings, an endowment with nearly $500m in assets.</p> <p>In October, a group of Goldman investors, activists and a current bank client sent a letter to its board “expressing concern about this lack of action” on arbitration.</p> <p>For the October <a href=\"https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/Letter to the Board on Forced Arbitration-0cf8c5b7-a049-4eed-b5e9-5852b09960c9.pdf\">letter</a>, “we had investors, clients, people who sold their firms to Goldman and zero response just doesn't make any sense on this issue,” said Kristin Hull, chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, which manages about $470m. Goldman needs to take the concerns about arbitration seriously to continue to retain talented employees, she said.</p> <p>Goldman declined to comment, pointing to its statement in June that it was reviewing its policies.</p> <p>Companies often require employees to go to arbitration because it can be less expensive and less public than court. However, arbitration also “prevents the use of the class-action process” in court, said Laura Campos, a director at Nathan Cummings. The endowment has filed arbitration disclosure petitions at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Both banks declined to comment.</p> <p>The fight over mandatory arbitration has proliferated in recent years in different sectors of business.</p> <p>In 2020, a resolution filed by the New York City pension funds asking restaurant chain Chipotle to disclose more about its use of mandatory arbitration <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/statement-from-new-york-city-comptroller-scott-m-stringer-on-passage-of-mandatory-arbitration-proposal-at-chipotle-annual-meeting/\">won 51 per cent support</a>. Google in 2018 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce3c11ec-e37e-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee\">ended forced arbitration </a>for sexual harassment claims by employees. </p> <p>Investors focused on environmental, social and governance strategies have pushed companies to drop mandatory arbitration. An arbitration shareholder proposal at Sunrun, a solar company, won a majority of investor support earlier this year. And an arbitration vote at Tesla won 45 per cent of investor votes, according to ISS Corporate Solutions.</p> <p>The arbitration proposals at the three banks are not guaranteed to go to a vote next year. Typically, companies ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to block shareholder proposals, and the agency may grant the request.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Joshua Franklin<br></em></p><p>Source: Patrick Temple-West in New York 2021 'Activists press Goldman over its handling of harassment cases' FT.com 12 December.
