  "title": "Fed's Powell Could Seal Expectations of Half-Point Rate Rise in May; Chairman Jerome Powell to speak Thursday afternoon as Fed officials have broadly signaled desire to raise interest rates to levels that don't provide stimulus",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Powell is scheduled to participate in a panel discussion hosted by the International Monetary Fund, where he is set to be joined by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.</p><p>Mr. Powell last month signaled half-point rate increases were possible at the Fed's coming policy meetings, and since then, his top lieutenants on the central bank's rate-setting committee have cemented expectations in interest-rate future markets of a half-point rate increase at the May gathering.</p><p>The Fed raised rates from near zero by a quarter-percentage point at its meeting last month, its first rate increase in more than three years. Fed officials including governor Lael Brainard, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to serve as the central bank's vice chair, have almost unanimously signaled a desire to raise rates expeditiously to a more neutral setting that no longer provides stimulus. New York Fed President John Williams said last week that a half-point rate rise in May was a \"very reasonable option.\"</p><p>A rate increase next month would mark the first time since 2006 that the central bank increased its policy rate at back-to-back meetings, and a half-point increase would be the first such move since 2000.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for the global economy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In prerecorded remarks at a separate conference on Thursday morning, Mr. Powell extolled the example of former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who raised interest rates aggressively in the early 1980s to stamp out inflation.</p><p>\"Chair Volcker understood that expectations for inflation play a significant role in its persistence,\" said Mr. Powell. \"He therefore had to fight on two fronts: slaying, as he called it, the 'inflationary dragon' and dismantling the public's belief that elevated inflation was an unfortunate, but immutable, fact of life.\"</p><p>Mr. Volcker \"knew that in order to tame inflation and heal the economy, he had to stay the course,\" Mr. Powell said.</p><p>The Labor Department is set to report on April 29 on a widely watched measure of labor costs during the first quarter. Economists at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. estimate a separate release by the Commerce Department of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, also due April 29, will show that core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items, rose 5.3% over the year through March, down from their 12-month increase of 5.4% in February.</p><p>Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com</p><p>Fed's Powell Could Seal Expectations of Half-Point Rate Rise in May</p>",
