  "text": "<p>How are stocks trading</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 359 points, or 1.2%, at 31,399.</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 61 points, or 1.6%, to 3,905.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP increased 265 points, or 2.3%, to 11,627.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 70 points, or 0.23%, to 31038, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 14 points, or 0.36%, to 3845, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 40 points, or 0.35%, to 11362.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks were marching higher Thursday heading into the closing bell, putting them on pace for a string of weekly gains to kick off July.</p><p>\"It's a calm before the storm,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global marco strategist at State Street Global Markets, referring to the release Friday morning of the June jobs report.</p><p>\"Inflation and employment prints are the most important right now,\" Loh said by phone. \"Anything significantly off from expectations is going to read as potentially signaling some sort of trend,\" which could influence the Fed's interest rate-hiking plans through year-end, he said.</p><p>Read: Hiring in U.S. likely fell to 18-month low in June —250,000 new jobs forecast</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the market higher as investors also reacted to the fall in commodity prices over the past month, which has helped to cause a moderation in inflation expectations and a fall in bond yields. The shift has benefited growth stock valuations.</p><p>Even as crude oil prices snapped a 2-day skid on Thursday, they remained down nearly 20% over the past month, though energy stocks rallied on the day, reversing some recent losses. Chevron CVX rose 2.3%, while Exxon XOM gained 3.7%.</p><p>Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said economic growth fears that have triggered the pullback in commodity prices also have inspired a shift in thinking about the Federal Reserve's plans.</p><p>Investors increasingly are betting that the central bank won't need to be as aggressive with its interest rate hikes.</p><p>\"Markets right now are betting that the Fed is going to break and follow the economy, not necessarily inflation,\" Nolte said.</p><p>Instead, traders are hoping that the battering delivered to stocks this year means that there might be an opportunity for the market to be pleasantly surprised when the U.S. second quarter earnings reporting season enters full swing next week.</p><p>While awaiting Friday's jobs report, investors heard from several Fed officials, including Fed Gov. Christopher Waller who said he backs a 75 basis point rate hike later this month, and likely another 50 basis point increase in September. Waller also said recession worries are \"overblown.\"</p><p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard also said Thursday that he didn't see a U.S. recession on the horizon, but that there's a \"good chance\"of a soft economic landing.</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose for a second day in a row, up 9.6 basis points to 3.007%.</p><p>Data released Thursday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless insurance increasedby 4,000 last week, while the number of ongoing claims increased by 51,000.</p><p>The U.S. also saw its trade deficit narrow in May, data that Capital Economics says could help bolster growth in the second quarter. Lately, investors have increasingly feared that the U.S. economy might see slow growth, or perhaps even a contraction, during the second quarter.</p><p>Single stock movers</p><p>* Shares of Micron MU, AMD AMD and Nvidia NVDA were all higher by more than 2.5% after South Korea's Samsung KR:005930 reported stronger than expectedearnings guidance.</p><p>* Freeport-McMoRan FCX, Schlumberger SLB and Diamondback Energy FANG, APA Corp.

OTIS slumped 1.6% on Thursday after a JP Morgan analyst expressed concerns about the stock's valuation.</p><p>Other markets</p><p>* Crude oil prices closed higher. West Texas Intermediate crude CL.1 CLQ22 rose 4.3% to settle at $102.73 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark lost nearly $10 over the previous two sessions amid worries about easing global demand.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar Index DXY was up less than 0.1%. On Wednesday, the dollar topped 107, its highest level in 19 years as worries about the European economy and political turmoil in the U.K. pressured the euro and sterling.</p><p>* Gold GC00 GCQ22 rose 0.2% to end at $1,739.70.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD advanced by 5.9% to above $21,000, but was still down nearly 70% from its record high, as traders warily eye recent turmoil in the crypto sector.</p><p>* In Europe, the STOXX Europe 600 XX:SXXP climbed 1.9%, while the FTSE 100 UK:UKX in London rose 1.1% after U.K media said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would resign.
