  "text": "<p>Deutsche Bank has reported its highest third-quarter pre-tax profit since before the financial crisis, as it benefited from rising interest rates and frantic fixed income and currency trading but disclosed another delay to a key IT integration project.</p> <p>Pre-tax profit at Germany's largest lender more than doubled to €1.6bn in the third quarter, the highest since 2006 and above the average analyst expectation of €1.3bn. All four divisions of the bank posted higher revenue, with its investment bank unit gaining market share in fixed income trading.</p> <p>Chief financial officer James von Moltke called 2022 “a landmark year for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/155f69d8-9bdd-4354-935a-6a0647a92f90\">Deutsche Bank</a>”. </p> <p>Over the first three quarters, the lender's return on tangible equity stood at 8.1 per cent, in line with a target announced three years ago. </p> <p>“We are well on track to meet our 2022 goals,” chief executive Christian Sewing said in a statement on Wednesday.</p> <p>However, an already delayed key IT project in Deutsche's German retail bank which was kicked off in 2017 has suffered another setback. Von Moltke told journalists in a call that the migration of all client data of Postbank on to Deutsche's own systems may only be finished by the end of September 2023. </p> <p>Von Moltke described the project as “very large [and] very complicated”, adding that it was “something that we need to do with real care.”</p> <p>The project, which von Moltke described as one of the bank's most important ones, was originally supposed to be finished by the end of this year. When the Financial Times first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/039cacda-c86a-4ef5-a9db-9fd304618708\">reported about additional delays</a> in July, the bank said the “duration of the project” had been extended by just three months.</p> <p>The bank will have to take a financial hit of €200mn from the delays, compared with a previous estimate of €150mn. </p> <p>Von Moltke said it was too early to give a concrete outlook for 2023, pointing to the vast uncertainties triggered by the war in Ukraine, inflation and the energy crisis. “Certainly it would be our ambition to build on the performance in 2022,” he said, but “we need to be realistic” as the coming year “will carry some risks”. </p> <p>Deutsche now expects only a small rise in credit loss provisions in 2023. In the third quarter, it earmarked €350mn for bad loans, more than twice last year's level.</p> <p>While the bank confirmed that it will meet its 2022 target of bringing costs down to less than 75 per cent of revenue, Kian Abouhossein, analyst at JPMorgan, said that “cost was disappointing”. Over the third quarter, adjusted costs excluding transformation costs were 4 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p> <p>The bank's common equity tier one ratio, a key indicator of its balance sheet strength, rose to 13.3 per cent by the end of September and was 0.3 percentage points higher than at the end of June. </p> <p>Shares in Deutsche fell 0.4 per cent in morning trading in Frankfurt. </p><p>Source: Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt 2022 'Deutsche Bank profit buoyed by rising interest rates' FT.com 26 October.
