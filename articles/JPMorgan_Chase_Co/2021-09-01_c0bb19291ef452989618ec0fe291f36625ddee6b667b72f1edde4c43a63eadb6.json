  "title": "U.S. News:  Texas GOP Lawmakers Approve Voting Bill  ----  By Jon Kamp",
  "text": "<p>   Republican lawmakers in Texas sent a voting bill to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott after overcoming months of hurdles by Democrats who sought to kill the legislation, including through a July walkout that saw many leave the state for Washington, D.C. </p><p>   The bill, which Republicans say is a way to enhance election security, would broadly tighten voting procedures across the state. Democrats said it would restrict access to the polls, especially for minorities. </p><p>   Gov. Abbott supports the measure and said Tuesday that he looks forward to signing it into law. </p><p>   The battle over the bill is part of a national debate over voting rules following President Biden's election, which former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters claim was illegitimate. No court has found evidence of widespread voter fraud. In recent months, states including Florida and Georgia passed GOP-led measures placing more restrictions on certain types of voting, drawing pushback from civil-rights groups, companies and Democrats. </p><p>   Provisions in the Texas bill includes a new limit on early-voting hours to between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., rather than allowing counties to offer as many voting hours as they choose, above a minimum. The bill also places new restrictions on structures that can be used for voting. It bans public officials from offering people unsolicited applications to vote by mail. </p><p>   The bill increases penalties for election-related paperwork that is submitted incorrectly and makes many violations of the code felony offenses. </p><p>   Democrats in Texas made multiple attempts to halt the bill, including a walkout in May ahead of a voting deadline as the state Legislature's regular biennial session wound down. This denied the legislative body the two-thirds quorum required to conduct a vote. Two months later, more than 55 House Democrats went to Washington, D.C., to once again deny a quorum during a special session Mr. Abbott called. </p><p>   The Texas Democrats lobbied Congress for federal legislation that would raise hurdles to state-level voting changes, but a Democrat-supported federal voting bill faces long odds due to lack of Republican support in the closely divided Senate. </p><p>   Texas Republicans were ultimately able to move the state-level bill forward, as they control both chambers of the state Legislature and the governor's office. Mr. Abbott had vowed to keep calling special sessions to pass the bill; the most recent special session started on Aug. 7, and the 38-day standoff ended on Aug. 20. </p><p>   The bill, known as Senate Bill 1, \"will solidify trust and confidence in the outcome of our elections by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat,\" Mr. Abbott said in a statement, after the bill cleared the Texas Senate on Tuesday. </p><p>   Opponents said the 75-page bill would create additional hurdles to voting in what civil-rights groups already rank as one of the country's most difficult states to vote. </p><p></p>",
