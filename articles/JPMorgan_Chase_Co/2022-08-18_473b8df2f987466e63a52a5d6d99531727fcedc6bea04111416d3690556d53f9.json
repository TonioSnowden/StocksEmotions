  "title": "U.K. Inflation Rate Tops 10%, Leading a Rise Across Europe",
  "text": "<p>That is because energy prices have continued to accelerate across Europe as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas, with the continent facing a possible crunch this winter.</p><p>The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that consumer prices were 10.1% higher in July than a year earlier, up from 9.4% in June.</p><p>That was the highest rate of inflation in more than four decades and the fastest increase in prices recorded in one of the Group of Seven rich countries since the current surge started in early 2021.</p><p>\"Inflation figures continue to paint a worrying picture for consumers and businesses alike, and price pressures are set to build further,\" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry.</p><p>Figures to be released on Thursday by the European Union's statistics agency are expected to show the eurozone's annual rate of inflation rose to 8.9% in July from 8.6% in June.</p><p>By contrast, U.S. inflation eased to 8.5% in July from 9.1% in June.</p><p>Economists at JPMorgan see increasing signs that global inflation is set to cool off, with prices of food and many commodities down from recent peaks.</p><p>However, they expect disinflation to be evident first in the U.S., with Europe set to lag behind despite some recent easing in the prices of goods leaving factory gates.</p><p>\"Europe, however, faces ongoing pressure from surging natural-gas prices that have more than doubled over the past three months,\" they wrote in a note to clients. \"We expect the combined drag of a squeeze on purchasing power and depressed sentiment to tip the region into recession this year.\"</p><p>July is unlikely to mark the peak in U.K. inflation, since household energy costs are set to rise sharply when a cap on prices is lifted in October.</p><p>The Bank of England estimated that could send the annual rate of inflation to 13% as the year draws to a close.</p><p>The U.K. is suffering a particularly severe surge in prices in part because of its 2016 decision to leave the European Union, which has caused costs for importers to increase, while a weaker pound has also raised the prices of goods and services purchased overseas.</p><p>Brexit has also reduced the availability of foreign workers in some lower-paid services industries, such as hospitality, pushing costs and prices higher.</p><p>However, the U.K. might not be the only one of Europe's three G-7 members set to face the double-digit inflation that has already hit Spain, Greece and a number of the EU's eastern members.</p><p>Germany's gas regulator on Monday announced a surcharge on gas prices designed to cover most of the increased costs to home energy suppliers since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Economists estimated that will send Germany's annual rate of inflation above 10% from 7.5% in July.</p><p>U.K. figures released on Tuesday by the ONS showed wages excluding bonuses were 4.7% higher in the three months through June than a year earlier, a pickup from the 4.4% rate of growth recorded in the three months through May.</p><p>Much of the pickup came from the private sector, where wages were up 5.9% when bonuses are included.</p><p>Many businesses are giving workers one-time payments to help cover surging energy and food costs, as well as standard pay raises.</p><p>Labor union Unite on Monday said British Airways had agreed to pay its check-in staff a lump sum equivalent to 5% of their salaries this month, with a regular 5% pay raise to follow in September, and a further 3% increase in January.</p><p>\"Like most other workers, our members in BA are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis,\" said Oliver Richardson, a Unite official.</p><p>The acceleration in wage raises will worry the Bank of England, which wants to avert a self-reinforcing series of wage and price increases of the kind that kept inflation high for many years in the 1970s.</p><p>Investors now expect the central bank to raise its key interest rate by a half percentage point when policy makers next meet in mid-September, having this month broken with a quarter-century tradition of only increasing borrowing costs by a quarter point in each step.</p><p>\"Today's ugly inflation print combined with the stronger earnings read should keep the MPC on track to deliver multiple [half-point] hikes this year,\" said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank. \"Relative to our base case, risks are tilted to an even more front-loaded and protracted hiking cycle.\"</p><p>Even as it picked up, wage growth fell further behind the rate of inflation, with the result that real wages fell 4.1%, the largest decline since records began in 2001.</p><p>That blow to consumer spending threatens to push the economy into an even-deeper contraction than the central bank already expects.</p><p>The European Central Bank is also seeking to strike a balance between tackling surging inflation and limiting the hit to the eurozone economy from higher energy prices.</p><p>It also broke with recent practice by raising its key rate by a half percentage point in July, and many economists expect it to repeat that move in September.</p><p>The U.K. government has already made public three packages of support to help households meet higher energy bills without having to cut back on other essentials, but economists expect a fourth package to follow the election of a new prime minister in early September.</p><p>The government's response to what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis has been on hold since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted as head of the ruling Conservative Party in early July, and the lengthy process of choosing his successor is due to end on Sept. 5.</p><p>\"We'll prepare all the options, ready for the incoming prime minister so that they can hit the ground running on what more we can do,\" said Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.'s Treasury chief.</p><p>The German government and others in Europe are also considering additional support for households that face skyrocketing energy costs.</p><p>\"We're putting together another relief package,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote in a tweet on Monday. \"We don't leave anyone alone with the higher costs.\"</p>",
