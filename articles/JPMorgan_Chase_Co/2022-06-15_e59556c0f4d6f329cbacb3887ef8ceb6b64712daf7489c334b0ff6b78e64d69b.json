  "title": "Fed Raises Rates by 0.75 Percentage Point, Largest Increase Since 1994; Officials signal a much more aggressive path of rate rises to combat inflation that is running at a 40-year high",
  "text": "<p>New projections showed all 18 officials who participated in the meeting expect the Fed to raise rates to at least 3% this year, with at least half of all officials indicating the fed-funds rate might need to rise to around 3.375% this year.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the central bank wasn't trying to induce a recession. But he said it was becoming more difficult to achieve a so-called \"soft landing,\" in which the economy slows enough to bring inflation down while avoiding a recession. That represented an implicit concession that the risks of a downturn could rise as the economy digests tighter monetary policy.</p><p>Markets React</p><p>* Latest Updates on the Fed Decision and Markets</p><p>* Stocks Rally After Fed Rate Increase</p><p>* Powell's Comments Send Treasury Yields Lower</p><p>\"The events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty\" of achieving a soft landing, Mr. Powell said. \"There's a much bigger chance now that it'll depend on factors that we don't control. Fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 54.51 points, or 1.5%, to 3789.99, snapping a five-day losing streak. U.S. government bonds rallied after sliding in recent weeks in a selloff that had pushed yields to their highest levels in more than a decade. The yield on 10-year Treasurys slipped to 3.389% from 3.482% Tuesday.</p><p>The Fed In Its Own Words</p><p>* The Fed's Monetary-Policy Statement</p><p>* The Fed's Summary of Economic Projections</p><p>Last week, the Labor Department reported the consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May, driven by higher energy prices. Rising fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions from Russia's war against Ukraine have sent prices up in recent months.</p><p>Mr. Powell's comments indicated that the Fed \"will have to keep jamming on the brakes even if growth struggles, and the market didn't get it,\" said Priya Misra, head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities.</p><p>Ms. Misra warned that markets would face higher volatility until inflation is clearly diminishing. \"Today, everyone is cheering, but if inflation has not peaked, we will have to go through the stress of the last few days all over again,\" she said.</p><p>Expectations of a larger rate rise and a higher path of rate rises had convulsed bond markets in recent days. Over the five days through Tuesday, the two-year Treasury yield had climbed by 0.7 percentage point, the largest such increase since 1982, according to JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Wednesday's rate increase departed from unusually precise guidance delivered by many members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee in recent weeks indicating they would raise rates by a smaller half percentage point, as officials did at their meeting last month.</p><p>Mr. Powell said the committee had decided to approve the larger rate rise due to concerns over recent data on inflation and expectations of future inflation, which economists believe play a key role influencing actual inflation. He said officials decided it didn't make sense to wait until July to move to a larger rate increase.</p><p>The committee vote was 10-1, with Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissenting in favor of a half-percentage-point, or 50-basis-point, increase.</p><p>\"Clearly, today's 75-basis-point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,\" Mr. Powell said. \"From the perspective of today, either a 50-basis-point or a 75-basis-point increase seems most likely at our next meeting\" on July 26-27.</p><p>Mr. Powell said he expected the central bank would raise rates to levels designed to deliberately slow the economy. \"We think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don't know how restrictive,\" he said.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Powell said he saw no signs of a broader slowdown in the economy. \"You're seeing continuing shifts in consumptionâ€¦but overall spending is very strong,\" he said.</p><p>Wednesday's projections showed officials see the fed-funds rate peaking at around 3.75% by the end of 2023, up from the 2.75% rate that officials projected in March but slightly below what interest-rate futures markets had anticipated earlier this week.</p><p>Such a pace of increases would nevertheless represent the most aggressive rate-rise cycle since the 1980s. The central bank has also initiated a program to withdraw stimulus by shrinking its $8.9 trillion asset portfolio through attrition; the Fed is passively reducing its holdings as those securities mature.</p><p>Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com</p><p>Fed Raises Rates by 0.75 Percentage Point, Largest Increase Since 1994</p>",
