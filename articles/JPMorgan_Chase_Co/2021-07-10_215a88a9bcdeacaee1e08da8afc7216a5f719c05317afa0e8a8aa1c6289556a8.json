  "text": "<p>   Other policies might be playing a role in driving labor market mismatch, most notably, federal jobless benefit programs and Covid-19 relief payments. Generous benefits might be slowing down the search of workers on the sideline. Among 24 states that have announced a June or July end to supplemental unemployment insurance benefits, the average unemployment rate in May was 4.4%. The rest of states and the District of Columbia set a later end to the program in September. The jobless rate on average in those states was 6.0% in May, though it had fallen more since January than in the states ending benefits early. </p><p>   For companies looking to staff up, this is a large and expensive headache; for workers it might be a chance to find better jobs that suit them in the long run. </p><p>   \"People are taking their time to find better matches and that is being in part facilitated by the additional support, the unemployment insurance as well as the stimulus checks,\" said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Better fits, he noted, could lead to higher wages and more worker productivity in the long run. The slow matching process, in other words, might not be all bad. </p><p>   Mr. Taylor, the out-of-work events planner, said he was drawing on unemployment benefits of $400 per week, including $300 in federal funds. He said the jobless benefits are helping support him financially while he searches for a job he hopes will be a good fit for his skill set and will allow him to resume his career. </p><p>   Because of the abundance of job openings, labor market trends that usually happen in a mature expansion when unemployment is low -- such as rising wages, people quitting jobs to look for others, companies complaining of worker shortages -- are oddly happening at the beginning of this one. For instance, the percentage of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs in May, 2.5%, was near record levels. </p><p>   The Flynn Restaurant Group, which operates Wendy's, Panera Bread, Taco Bell, Applebee's and Pizza Hut franchises in 44 states, is pushing bonuses of $100 to $250 to employees when they refer prospective workers who are hired. Delivery drivers are getting free pizza. </p><p>   People discovered in the pandemic that they like flexible hours and working from home, said Betsy Mercado, senior vice president of human resources at Flynn. \"They are trying to figure out what job is going to provide them with the most income and the flexibility they need,\" she said. </p><p>   \"People have an ability now to really choose where they want to work.\" </p><p>   One key question is whether these developments are temporary or long-lasting. Federal Reserve officials are expecting the jobless rate to fall faster than it has. By the fourth quarter, they expect it to reach 4.5%, more than a percentage point from where it was in June. Reaching that goal will be a stretch if the pace of job matching doesn't pick up. </p><p>   If the jobless rate doesn't fall more, the Fed will have a riddle to solve: Should it keep its low interest-rate policies in place longer to spur economic growth and more aggressive hiring by firms, or should it raise rates to forestall inflation pressures in an economy beset by nagging bottlenecks, including those in labor markets. </p><p>   Prospective workers could be forced to move more aggressively in the months ahead as jobless benefits expire. Because all states are slated to end supplemental benefits by early September, the next few months will be critical in shaping how aggressively people look for jobs. </p><p>   Robert Hall, an economics professor at Stanford University, says the job matching process has progressed in two stages. Last year, millions of people were called back to their jobs from temporary layoffs and the unemployment rate descended quickly from 14.8% to 6.7%. This year, the progress has slowed markedly; the jobless rate fell from 6.3% in January to 5.9% in June. </p><p>   Mr. Hall and Marianna Kudlyak at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco studied the past 10 recoveries and concluded that U.S. job recoveries have a common pattern. In normal times, they find, \"unemployment rises like a rocket and falls like a feather.\" </p><p>   \"The easy stuff has been accomplished,\" Mr. Hall said in an interview. The rest of the job recovery, he concluded, is going to take some time. </p><p></p>",
