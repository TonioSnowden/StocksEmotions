  "text": "<p>American Express revenues jumped in the second quarter on the back of a rebound in consumer spending, ending a five-quarter run of declines for the credit card issuer.</p> <p>Revenue rose 33 per cent to $10.2bn from $7.7bn a year earlier, coming in ahead of analysts' forecasts for $9.6bn, according to a consensus data compiled by Bloomberg.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rise underscores the recent recovery in consumer spending, following several months when customers paying down debt and closing accounts exceeded new sign-ups.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We saw card member spending accelerate from the prior quarter and exceed pre-pandemic levels in June, with the largest portion of this spending growth coming from Millennial, Gen Z, and small business customers,” said Stephen Squeri, Amex chair and chief executive.&#xa0;</p> <p>Credit card companies are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7498eeb1-b10c-42f0-b5e3-957aef45810f\">spending heavily</a> to lure new customers in the hope that they turn into borrowers once they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5639abec-0d97-49e6-a1eb-fe1bba9280aa\">whittle down</a> the savings cushions built up during the pandemic.</p> <p>Amex's marketing expenses rose 63 per cent in the quarter ahead of the launch of its US consumer Platinum Card, which the company says offers improved lifestyle and travel benefits. &#xa0;</p> <p>Discover Financial Services, which reported earnings earlier this week, said a 36 per cent increase in marketing contributed to a 26 per cent rise in new accounts over 2019 levels in the most recent quarter. Average credit card loans still fell 7 per cent.</p> <p>Top US lenders, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, have each unveiled new credit cards with enhanced rewards like souped-up cashback offerings in recent months in an effort to jump start growth. But analysts expect those promotions to be reined in before long.</p> <p>“I do think some of the rewards products out there will not be sustainable long-term,” Discover chief executive Roger Hochschild warned.&#xa0;</p> <p>Overall, Amex reported second quarter net income of $2.3bn, up from $257m a year ago. This was boosted by the release of $866m in releases of reserves for potential bad loans.</p> <p>Amex's stock was up 3.3 per cent in pre-market trading.</p><p>Source: Imani Moise and Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Consumer spending rebound boosts American Express earnings' FT.com 23 July.
