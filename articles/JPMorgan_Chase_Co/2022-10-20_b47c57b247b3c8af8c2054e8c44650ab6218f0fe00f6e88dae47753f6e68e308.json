  "text": "<p>Major central banks are expected to further lift interest rates during coming meetings as price pressures show little signs of easing. Inflation figures in the U.K. and Canada came in above expectations this week. Germany's producer prices rose strongly in September from a year earlier, driven by higher energy prices, the German statistics office Destatis said Thursday.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times this year and is likely to increase its benchmark federal-funds rate by another 0.75 percentage point at its meeting next month as it tries to bring down high inflation.</p><p>\"At the moment, we keep getting upside surprises on inflation everywhere you look,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"No one really has a good grasp yet of where the central banks—particularly the Fed—are going to be able to stop [raising rates].\"</p><p>Investors are also trying to assess if higher inflation and tightening financial conditions will feed through to earnings season. Mr. Gimber said he's paying attention to how companies are affected by wage pressure and higher input costs and if those costs can be passed on to consumers.</p><p>Tesla shares fell about 5% premarket after the electric-car maker cut its full-year growth expectations. Whirlpool and Snap are slated to post quarterly results after the market close.</p><p>The Labor Department is due to release figures on the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 15 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.4%. South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 each shed 0.9%.</p><p>The Japanese yen hit a 32-year low of 150 to the dollar.
