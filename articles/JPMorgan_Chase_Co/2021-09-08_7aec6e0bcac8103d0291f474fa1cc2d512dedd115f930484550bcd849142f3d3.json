  "title": "U.S. IPO market set for busy fall as six deals launch; long-awaited names like Warby Parker, Authentic Brands expected soon",
  "text": "<p>With the broader equity markets at record levels and a robust pipeline of private unicorns, or companies valued at more than $1 billion, “many long-awaited names will finally take the leap to public markets, supported by the busiest month of August for new filings in over a decade,” said Bill Smith, founder and chief executive of  Renaissance Capital,  a provider of institutional research and IPO exchange-traded funds.</p><p>“That said, fall IPO activity is unlikely to match the summer's frantic pace,” Smith wrote in commentary. “August filings were down from prior months, and the year's weak IPO aftermarket returns serve as a headwind, evidenced by several postponements at the end of July.”</p><p>Still, as of Sept. 1, there were 115 U.S. IPOs publicly on file, of which 81 have updated filings since June 1, suggesting they are actively working up deals. The list includes names like eyeglass maker Warby Parker WRBY — planning a direct listing  — and restaurant payment processor Toast TOST, as well as Authentic Brands Inc. AUTH, parent of retailers Forever 21 and Nine West and owner of Sports Illustrated and the holder of the brand name and rights to such legendary stars as Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, plus eco-friendly shoe maker Allbirds BIRD.</p><p>Don't miss: Allbirds IPO: 5 things to know about the eco-friendly shoe company before it goes public </p><p>Assuming the stock market holds up, Renaissance is expecting 90 to 110 U.S. IPOs by year-end, raising $30 billion.
