  "text": "<p>   New York City employers are starting to divulge more details about salaries ahead of a law taking effect this week that will require nearly all job postings to include a pay range, a move expected to reshape workplaces and how companies hire. </p><p>   The measure, aimed at closing gender pay gaps and other disparities, requires companies to include salary ranges if they hire in New York or advertise for remote roles that could be done in the city. Similar laws have either gone into effect or are set to be implemented elsewhere, including in Colorado and California. </p><p>   Some large New York employers, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and American Express Co., have begun including salary ranges on postings. In recent weeks, Citigroup Inc. and Macy's Inc. updated all job listings to include pay ranges nationwide. </p><p>   For example, Macy's disclosed that the annual salary for a New York-based sales and customer-service manager ranges from about $51,000 to $85,000. </p><p>   Ahead of the law, which takes effect Tuesday, companies have analyzed existing pay bands or prepared managers for potentially contentious conversations with existing employees about pay matters, according to executives and corporate advisers. Other employers plan to sidestep the requirements by pulling all job listings off their sites or by outsourcing more hiring, employment lawyers say. </p><p>   Plenty of companies are still trying to get a handle on it. \"We're very much at the two-minute warning of this law going into effect, and many employers are still scrambling,\" said Ian Carleton Schaefer, chairman of Loeb &amp; Loeb LLP's New York employment and labor practice. </p><p>   Companies have resisted sharing pay information broadly, saying it could make hiring more difficult, tip off competitors about pay practices or create disputes among employees. </p><p>   Some business groups such as the Partnership for New York City pushed back against the New York law earlier this year, calling it overly burdensome, although many of the group's members have since accepted it and are preparing to comply, said Kathryn Wylde, the partnership's chief executive officer. </p><p>   At the New York technology company Harri, which employs about 500 people, executives sent multiple internal advisories in recent weeks to remind hiring managers that the New York law is coming, said Wendy Harkness, Harri's chief compliance officer. The company prepared tipsheets for managers on how to handle questions about pay from existing employees, and human-resources staffers will be on hand to help managers navigate such discussions, she said. </p><p>   New York City's law applies to employers with four or more workers and requires that companies include the minimum and maximum salary information not only on external job postings but also for internal promotions or transfer opportunities. Employers must include a \"good faith\" range that they expect to pay for the role. They don't need to include information about bonuses, stock-based compensation or other benefits. </p><p>   Those that fail to comply could face fines. The New York City Commission on Human Rights, which will investigate complaints made against employers related to the law, has said companies will initially get a warning for not including pay ranges. Those that then fail to correct an issue after 30 days might face civil penalties and fines of up to $250,000. </p><p>   Executives said it remains to be seen how companies interpret what a good-faith range means. Compensation specialists said it can be common for some higher-level jobs to have wide ranges. Already, some posted jobs have bands that vary by hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p><p>   A position for a tax-services director at accounting and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for example, has a posted range of $158,400 to $434,000 in New York, plus a discretionary annual bonus. \"Actual compensation within that range will be dependent upon the individual's skills, experience, qualifications, and applicable laws,\" the posting notes. A PwC spokeswoman declined to comment. </p><p>    Jeanne Stewart, founder and president of the New York human-resources consulting firm HR on the Move LLC, said she has had conversations with clients who tell her they don't intend to start posting salary ranges because it could cause internal disputes or quitting. </p><p>   \"They're telling me, 'We're not doing it.' And then I have to say, 'Well, let me speak to your boss,'\" she said, referring to some client conversations. \"Then the boss understands after I talk to them.\" </p><p>   Others are consulting with attorneys and advisers about ways to stay compliant with the law while still avoiding posting salaries. Some companies are considering removing job listings on their careers sites and encouraging people to submit resumes via a general email address, Mr. Schaefer of Loeb &amp; Loeb said. Others are exploring whether to never advertise a job at all and instead hire a search firm to find a candidate. </p><p>    Jacqueline M. Ebanks, executive director of the New York City Commission on Gender Equity, said hiring a search firm in such a way might allow employers to sidestep the law. \"It's there and, as I was reading the guidance, I thought, 'OK, here's a loophole,'\" she said at a forum on the law organized by Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. </p><p>   In a follow-up statement on Saturday, Ms. Ebanks said the administration of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, \"believes in transparency in the hiring process and leverage to employees when negotiating job salaries with employers, but no law is perfect.\" </p><p>   Ms. Ebanks said city officials also need to be mindful of employers posting remote positions that exclude New York City residents. Such a situation happened last year after Colorado began implementing its own salary-transparency law. To avoid including pay information, some employers noted on listings that remote jobs could be performed anywhere but Colorado. </p><p>   Salary-transparency laws take effect in California and the Washington state at the start of next year, and the New York state Legislature passed a similar bill that Gov. Kathy Hochul has yet to sign. As a result, some companies see a tipping point and are considering listing pay nationwide, rather than taking a patchwork approach. </p><p></p>",
