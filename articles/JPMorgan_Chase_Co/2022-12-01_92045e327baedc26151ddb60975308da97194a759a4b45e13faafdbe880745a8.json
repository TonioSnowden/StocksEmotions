  "title": "Fed's Top Banking Regulator Signals Tougher Bank-Capital Rules; Push for tighter capital rules would likely draw opposition from banks",
  "text": "<p>\"While the estimates vary widelyâ€¦current U.S. requirements are toward the low end of the range described in most of the research literature,\" Mr. Barr said in a speech hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. The written remarks were accompanied by about four pages of academic references.</p><p>Mr. Barr said he had not reached firm conclusions yet in his review of the capital framework. He characterized the Fed's overall requirements as strong and said he would have more to say in early 2023.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Should the Fed raise capital requirements for big banks? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Any move to boost capital requirements are likely to run into opposition from banks and their trade groups, who generally say the existing framework is robust and allowed them to emerge from the pandemic-triggered downturn in strong shape.</p><p>\"Further increasing bank capital requirements will reduce U.S. economic growth, further diminish capital markets liquidity, push more activity into the unregulated shadow banking sector and further disincentivize bank lending to small businesses and low- to moderate-income households,\" Francisco Covas, executive vice president and head of research at the Bank Policy Institute, said in a statement.</p><p>Capital rules seek to prevent too much risk-taking by forcing bankers to fund loans and investments with a minimum amount of investors' equity, as opposed to less-secure borrowed money.</p><p>The supervision role that Mr. Barr has filled since July is responsible for developing a broad vision for the regulation of big banks and other financial firms. That includes developing policy recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Randal Quarles, who previously held the Fed supervision post, focused on simplifying financial regulations enacted after the 2008-09 financial crisis, moves that supporters have said clarified or better calibrated the central bank's rules but that some Democrats said significantly softened the impact of the Wall Street rulebook. Mr. Quarles left the Fed last December.</p><p>While Mr. Barr's remarks didn't go into detail, they signaled an openness to altering bank capital requirements through changes to the central bank's annual \"stress tests,\" which aim to determine how large lenders would react to drastic market and economic shock.</p><p>\"We are currently evaluating whether the supervisory stress test that is used to set capital requirements for large banks reflects an appropriately wide range of risks,\" he said.</p><p>At least one Fed official has expressed skepticism about tougher rules. Michelle Bowman, a Fed governor appointed by President Trump, has warned that overregulation could impose undue costs on the economy.</p><p>\"In a time of rising interest rates that could constrain credit, it is especially important to ensure that regulation and supervision not add costs and burdens for banks with little or no benefits to safety and soundness,\" she said in a Sept. 30 speech.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Fed's Top Banking Regulator Signals Tougher Bank-Capital Rules</p>",
