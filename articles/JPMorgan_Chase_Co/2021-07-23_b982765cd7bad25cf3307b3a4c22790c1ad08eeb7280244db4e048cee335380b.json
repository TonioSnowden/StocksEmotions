  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) is pitching fellow Republican senators on a last-ditch gambit to block Democrats' $3.5 trillion budget resolution: Skip town. </p><p>   Mr. Graham believes a united Republican caucus can deny Democrats the 51 votes needed for quorum by leaving the capital en masse, citing the example of Texas Democrats, who fled their state to prevent the GOP-controlled legislature from enacting stricter voting laws. He said he is driven by his opposition to immigration provisions that Democrats might include in their resolution. </p><p>   \"If they put in amnesty . . . that's an assault on the system as we know it,\" Mr. Graham said. \"We should use any tool in our box to stop it.\" </p><p>   The Democrats' plan is expected to set aside $120 billion for establishing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers -- immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children -- as well as other groups that could include farmworkers, according to Senate aides. </p><p>   Some GOP senators are open to the quorum-busting idea, but others are skeptical. When senators tried a similar tack decades ago, Capitol Police carried one of the fugitive lawmakers back onto the floor. </p><p>   Mr. Graham's notion, put into play by the current 50-50 split in the Senate, has surfaced as longstanding norms and decorum are eroding on Capitol Hill. Normally, under the Senate's filibuster rule, the minority can prevent legislation from getting the 60 votes needed to advance. But a process called reconciliation allows budget-related bills to pass by simple majority, enabling Democrats to push through their $3.5 trillion package without any Republican support, if all 50 stick together. Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tie. </p><p>   There is no precedent under which Ms. Harris would count toward quorum, however. Given that math, and the Constitution's requirement that the Senate have a quorum to do business, some Republicans say they are intrigued by Mr. Graham's plan. The senator first floated it on Fox News Channel last weekend. </p><p>   \"I agree with him,\" said Sen. John Boozman (R., Ark.), who said he had a long visit with Mr. Graham to discuss the proposal. GOP Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said they would consider participating. Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.) is keeping an open mind but urged caution: \"It's a serious step.\" </p><p>   Democrats ridiculed Mr. Graham's strategy. \"Hallelujah,\" quipped Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.), when asked what he thought about the possibility of Republicans leaving D.C. \"This is goofy,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii). \"I think Lindsey was just being Lindsey.\" </p><p>   Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), for his part, was unconvinced. \"Republicans tend to show up and vote in person, unlike Texas Democrats,\" he said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Kristina Peterson and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
