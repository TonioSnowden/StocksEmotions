  "text": "<p>The president called on the companies to take immediate action to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. He said his administration was prepared to use its emergency authorities to increase capacity in the near-term, if necessary.</p><p>Mr. Biden added that he had directed Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to hold an emergency meeting and to engage with the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that represents the oil industry.</p><p>The letter was sent to Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips 66, Chevron Corp., BP and Shell. The companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Last week, when Mr. Biden said Exxon made \"more money than God this year,\" the company responded saying it plans to increase its refining capacity to process U.S.-produced light crude, by about 250,000 barrels a day. Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said that was \"the equivalent of adding a new medium-size refinery.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden requested that the companies provide his administration with an explanation of any reductions in capacity since 2020 as well as ideas for addressing high prices.</p><p>Gasoline prices have increased rapidly in recent months, hitting a national average of more than $5 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline last week, a record high. On Wednesday, the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in the U.S. was about $5.01, according to AAA.</p><p>Mr. Biden has said addressing record inflation, including high gasoline prices, is his economic priority. Inflation has contributed to the president's low poll numbers, and some Democrats worry it could lead to steep losses for Mr. Biden's party in the coming midterm elections.</p><p>The Biden administration has taken several steps to address high gasoline prices, with limited success. The U.S. has released oil from the country's strategic stockpiles in coordination with other nations and allowed high-ethanol content gasoline to be sold in the summer months.</p><p>White House officials said Mr. Biden is considering additional measures, including calling for a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax.</p><p>Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said he believes there is little either the Biden administration or the oil industry can do in the short-term to significantly increase gasoline production and oil supplies, as refineries in operation today are currently making as much product as they can.</p><p>\"You can have more gas, or you can have more diesel, but you can't have both,\" Mr. Lipow said.</p><p>U.S. refineries closed about 1 million barrels a day of capacity during the pandemic, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits</p>",
