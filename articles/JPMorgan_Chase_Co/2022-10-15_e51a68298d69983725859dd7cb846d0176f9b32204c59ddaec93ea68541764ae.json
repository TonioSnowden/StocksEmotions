  "text": "<p>\"CEOs are now preparing for near-inevitable recessions in both the US and Europe,\" said Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a Conference Board trustee and former Fed vice chair. \"While the vast majority still expect the US recession to be short and shallow, nearly 7 in 10 believe the EU will enter a deep recession with serious global spillovers.\"</p><p>Corporate bosses received more bad news this week after the latest U.S. consumer price index showed inflation running higher than expected at 8.2% in September. The reading affirmed a view that the Federal Reserve will continue sharply tightening monetary policy despite fears that its actions will trigger a lengthy recession.</p><p>Of the CEOs polled, just 5% felt economic conditions will improve over the next six months. Meanwhile, 81% said the economic outlook is worse for the fourth quarter than it was in the previous quarter.</p><p>Some 85% of CEOs expect the US recession to be brief and shallow, while 13% expect a deeper downturn with a \"material global spillover.\"</p><p>When asked to name the biggest global challenge their businesses currently face, 34% of CEOs pointed to political and government instability, while 17% cited energy access and security and 15% said the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>Even before the latest inflation data surfaced, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned the global economy faced a series of headwinds that would spark a recession next year, including higher interest rates and inflation.</p><p>\"These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the US and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the US in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,\" Dimon told CNBC.</p><p>Last month, FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam triggered a market selloff when he signaled a worldwide recession was already underway.</p><p>Executives and investors will gain a better sense of the Fed's policy path when officials conduct their next two-day meeting on Nov. 1-2. The Fed is widely expected to hike its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting.</p><p>This article was first published on NYPost.com</p><p>Nearly every U.S. CEO bracing for recession over next 12 to 18 months: survey</p>",
