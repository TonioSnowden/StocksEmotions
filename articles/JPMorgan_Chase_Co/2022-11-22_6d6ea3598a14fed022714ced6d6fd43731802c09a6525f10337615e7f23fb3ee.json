  "title": "Investor Home Purchases Drop 30% as Rising Rates, High Prices Cool Housing Market; Buying activity by companies fell in line with the decline in overall home sales amid higher borrowing costs",
  "text": "<p>Investor buying of homes tumbled 30% in the third quarter, a sign that the rise in borrowing rates and high home prices that pushed traditional buyers to the sidelines are causing these firms to pull back, too.</p><p>Companies bought around 66,000 homes in the 40 markets tracked by real-estate brokerage Redfin during the third quarter, compared with 94,000 homes during the same quarter a year ago. The percentage decline in investor purchases was the largest in a quarter since the subprime crisis, save for the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic shut down most home buying.</p><p>The investor pullback represents a turnaround from months ago when their purchases were still rising fast. These firms bought homes in record numbers last year and earlier this year, helping to supercharge the housing market.</p><p>Now, investors are reducing their buying activity in line with the decline in overall home sales, which have slumped with mortgage rates rising fast. But with investors' large cash positions, and with big firms such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. planning to increase its exposure to the home-buying business, investors are poised to resume more aggressive buying when rates or home prices begin to ease.</p><p>These firms have seized on a pandemic-driven rise in demand for houses in suburban areas. These owners rented out the homes and increased rents on homes by double-digit percentages. By the first quarter of 2022, investors accounted for one in every five home purchases nationally. </p><p>But ballooning borrowing costs have kept investors from buying as much recently, said John Pawlowski, an analyst at Green Street. Buyers and sellers are also agreeing less often on pricing, stifling sales.</p><p>\"It leads to a lot of people just putting down the pen,\" Mr. Pawlowski said.</p><p>Rent growth has also begun to slow. Rents for single-family homes rose 10.1% year over year in September, down from 13.9% in April, according to housing data firm CoreLogic.</p><p>Many of the places where investors have eased purchasing are the same cities where they had counted for an outsize share of total sales. That includes Las Vegas and Phoenix, where investor sales dropped more than 44% in the third quarter compared with a year ago.</p><p>Fewer purchases by online house-flippers, or iBuyers, may have contributed to those declines, according to Redfin. Redfin decided to close its own home-flipping business, RedfinNow, earlier this month.</p><p>Nationally, investors still accounted for 17.5% of all home sales in the third quarter, a higher share than they held at any time before the pandemic, by Redfin's count.</p><p>That share seems likely to rise again. Builders with unsold homes due to widespread cancellations by traditional buyers have been looking to sell in bulk to rental landlords.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for the real-estate investment market? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Meanwhile, some institutional investors are now readying large funds to snap up homes. J.P. Morgan's asset-management business said this month it had formed a joint venture with rental landlord Haven Realty Capital to purchase and develop $1 billion in houses. A unit of real-estate firm JLL, in partnership with the landlord Amherst Group, said it plans to buy $500 million of homes over the next two years.</p><p>Tricon Residential, a publicly traded landlord, has nearly $3 billion it plans to tap to buy homes. \"We will lean in and deploy that capital when the time is right,\" Tricon's Chief Executive Gary Berman said on a November earnings call.</p><p>While a recession could bring down borrowing rates, it would likely be accompanied by higher unemployment, making it difficult for traditional buyers to take advantage, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist. For investors, however, that could offer an opportunity to acquire homes at favorable prices.</p><p>\"An investor may have more resources to jump in at exactly the moment when rates decline,\" Ms. Fairweather said.</p><p>Write to Will Parker at will.parker@wsj.com</p><p>Investor Home Purchases Drop 30% as Rising Rates, High Prices Cool Housing Market</p>",
