  "text": "<p>The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite rose 185.60 points, or 1.3%, to 14354.90, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 94.65 points, or 0.3%, to close at 34955.89. The moves followed last week's rebound,as stocks rose for a second consecutive week. </p><p>Fed officials have recently signaled openness to the central bank making half-percentage-point interest rate increases if the economic outlook calls for it, rather than the quarter-percentage-point changes that are more customary. This has led economists and investors to re-evaluate how quickly they expect rates to climb. </p><p>As an era of easy-money policies comes to an end, markets could be in for a choppy ride, according to Jeff Schwaber, chief executive of Bluerock Capital Markets, \"Investors will be put more to a test—with regard to capital preservation and portfolio positioning—now than they have been in decades,\" said Mr. Schwaber. </p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.476%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note climbed to 2.340%. Investors are eyeing the possibility of a so-called yield inversion, where the two-year note yields more than the 10-year, which is historically tracked as a predictor of recession. </p><p>Meme stocks rose, with GameStop adding $37.64, or 25%, to $189.59. AMC Entertainment Holdings gained $9.09, or 45%, to $29.33, representing its largest percentage increase since last summer. </p><p>Tesla added $81.20, or 8%, to $1,091.84 after the electric car maker said it would request shareholder approval at its annual meeting for an increase in the number of shares of the company to enable a stock split.</p><p>In other stock news, Apple gained 88 cents, or 0.5%, to close at $175.60. The move marked the stock's 10th consecutive daily gain, its longest winning streak since 2010. </p><p>Oil prices fell after Shanghai imposed stringent pandemic restrictions that could weaken energy demand in China. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, declined $8.17 a barrel, or 6.8%, to $112.48.</p><p>Concerns over how Russia's war with Ukraine will disrupt energy production has kept oil prices at about $100 a barrel in recent weeks. Heightened prices also have bolstered concerns that consumers will have less money to spend on nonessential items, weighing on growth. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500's energy sector retreated 2.6%. The sector has been the benchmark's best performer this year so far, but analysts caution that a shrinking demand outlook could cool the rally. </p><p>\"The market, at the moment, is assuming that [higher energy prices] will moderate the pace of growth and central banks will tighten,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The degree to which central banks may increase interest rates is likely to depend on global growth and whether higher prices for energy and oil require lower rates to cushion growth, he added.</p><p>Federal-funds futures—derivatives used by traders to bet on the path of interest rates—show that investors have ramped up bets on a half-percentage-point rate increase at the Fed's May meeting since last week. </p><p>Russia's benchmark MOEX index fell 2.2% Monday in a shortened session as Moscow allowed all Russian shares to trade. Foreigners remain barred from selling shares, helping underpin the benchmark's level. </p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.1%. </p><p>In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin's dollar value rose for the fifth-consecutive day, adding 4.1% from its 5 p.m. ET level Sunday to trade at $47,944.16.</p><p>The Japanese yen fell 1.2% against the dollar to a more-than-six-year low after the Bank of Japan signaled that it wanted to keep a cap on rising yields.</p><p>Major indexes in Asia closed mixed. China's Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%. South Korea's Kospi was flat and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Finish Choppy Session Modestly Higher</p>",
