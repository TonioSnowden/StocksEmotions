  "title": "HPS Targets $9.5 Billion for Fifth Junior Debt Fund; The firm said it no longer expects to target investments in upstream energy companies because of oil price volatility",
  "text": "<p>If the firm achieves its target, the fund would be slightly larger than its predecessor, HPS Strategic Investment Partners IV LP, which wrapped up with $8.49 billion in 2019.</p><p>The general partnership will commit 2% or up to $100 million to the new fund, the documents said.</p><p>HPS was formed in 2007 as Highbridge Principal Strategies, which was part of a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The group, led by senior executives, including Chief Executive and Governing Partner Scott Kapnick, spun out of the asset management firm and rebranded as HPS Investment Partners in 2016. In 2018, the firm sold a minority stake in itself to Dyal Capital Partners, which is now part of publicly traded Blue Owl Capital.</p><p>The firm has several private and public credit strategies including direct lending, special situations, real estate and Europe-focused asset value funds.</p><p>The new junior debt fund is expected to target 40 to 50 investments in midsize and large companies with enterprise values of between $500 million and $15 billion, across various sectors which include information technology, business services and financials, according to the pension documents. The fund aims to hold its investments for two to five years. The strategic investment funds invest in mezzanine, subordinated debt, preferred equity and common equity co-investments, according to the firm's website.</p><p>In the new fund, HPS indicates that it doesn't intend to make any investments in upstream energy companies because of the volatility in oil prices, the documents said. As of June 30, energy accounted for almost 19% of the firm's third junior debt fund, which raised $6.7 billion in 2016, but only 1% of its fourth fund, the documents show. The firm had an aggregate of 12% of the total capital across its four previous strategic investment partners funds in energy as of that date.</p><p>The firm typically structures transactions with multiple covenants to protect its capital and negotiates for representation on the board or rights as an observer, the documents noted.</p><p>As of June 30, the firm's fourth fund had made 39 investments, five of which it had realized and had produced a net internal rate of return of 19.2%, the documents said.</p><p>HPS Investment Partners managed around $75 billion in assets across various strategies as of September, according to the firm's website. It announced the closing of its $11.7 billion specialty loan fund on Sept. 15.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
