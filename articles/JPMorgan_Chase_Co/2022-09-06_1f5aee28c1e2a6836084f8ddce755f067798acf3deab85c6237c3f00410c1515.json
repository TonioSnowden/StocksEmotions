  "text": "<p>Struggling home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond named an interim chief financial officer on Tuesday after Gustavo Arnal, who held the post for two years, fell to his death from a New York City high rise apartment building on Friday.</p> <p>Laura Crossen, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/cf251e6b-e976-43f5-8424-878039ecdde1\">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's</a> senior vice-president of finance and its chief accounting officer, will become interim chief financial officer, the US company said in a filing on Tuesday.</p> <p>The company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e38097a0-94e8-43f4-ae90-2b53cd22ca74\">confirmed on Sunday</a> that a man who was found unresponsive at a Tribeca tower in lower Manhattan and was pronounced dead at the scene was Arnal.</p> <p>The latest leadership change follows several tough months for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, including the departure of its chief executive, declining sales, heightened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-equities\">share</a> price volatility as well as plans to cut jobs and avoid a cash crunch.</p> <p>The retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17e53e8e-7560-4224-9d15-9f8f57c1637a\">ousted chief</a> Mark Tritton, a former Target executive who was appointed in 2019 to turn round the company, following dismal first-quarter earnings in June that also revealed a pile-up in excess inventory. Sue Gove, an independent director on the company's board, replaced Tritton as interim chief executive.</p> <p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94bf5271-56be-447a-b362-320ba0cb305d#post-7154d646-9b58-490b-9c38-6be142a2979e\">laid out plans</a> for a new turnround, promising to cut 20 per cent of its workforce and close about 150 stores. It also announced it had raised more than $500mn in new financing.</p> <p>Shares of the company have been volatile since it reported first-quarter earnings in June and are down about 50 per cent since the beginning of the year. The shares rallied in the first half of August after it became popular with meme stock investors, but tumbled after activist investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/891e8c35-6abf-400e-837b-3c0c6bfb6532\">Ryan Cohen</a>, who owned almost 12 per cent of the company, sold his entire stake.</p> <p>Cohen and Arnal have been named as defendants in a recent class-action lawsuit that accused the individuals, as well as JPMorgan Securities, of creating a “share-dumping crash”.</p> <p>The lawsuit accuses Cohen and Arnal of working together to “blatantly” misrepresent the value and profitability of the company by reporting revenue that was “fictitious”, accusing the duo of illegal insider trading and fraudulent reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Cohen had no comment.</p> <p>Arnal sold about 55,000 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares on August 16, according to a filing with the SEC, although the disclosure states this was part of a sale plan announced in April.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Madison Darbyshire</em></p><p>Source: Alexandra White in New York 2022 'Bed Bath &amp; Beyond names interim CFO following death of predecessor' FT.com 6 September.
