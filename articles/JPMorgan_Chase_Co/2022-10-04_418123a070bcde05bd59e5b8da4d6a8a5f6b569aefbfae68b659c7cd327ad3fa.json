  "title": "OPEC+ Girds for Contentious Meeting Over Oil-Production Cuts; Saudi Arabia seeks bigger-than-expected 1.5 million barrels a day cut, but not all producers are on board",
  "text": "<p>After surging above $100 a barrel in the first six months of the year over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, oil prices fell 32% over the past four months on global economic worries, with international benchmark Brent crude falling below $83 a barrel for the first time since January. Brent traded at $91.56 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon, having risen on expectation of a production cut.</p><p>Lining up against a large production cut are the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, big Persian Gulf producers that are worried long-term curbs would damage their plans to increase output capacity, the delegates said. The U.A.E., in particular, has invested tens of billions of dollars in recent years in expanding its capacity, they said.</p><p>There is also concern that the pain from any production cut wouldn't be shared across the board. With much of the West shunning its oil, Russia has curbed production involuntarily by about 1 million barrels a day or almost 10% of its peak output, and it faces further uncertainty on Dec. 5, when a European Union oil embargo and price-cap scheme goes into effect.</p><p>In a sign of the tension, OPEC+ called off a meeting of its technocrats scheduled for Tuesday, delegates said, because the disagreements were such that only a gathering of oil ministers could work things out.</p><p>Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and his Emirati counterpart, Suhail Al Mazrouei, declined to comment on the talks in Vienna.</p><p>After two years of virtual gatherings that often took less than 15 minutes, OPEC delegates said they are girding for a long meeting Wednesday inside their Vienna headquarters. In the past, OPEC meetings could stretch on for hours, sometimes days, when members disagreed, and delegates said they didn't know what to expect.</p><p>Ahead of Wednesday's OPEC+ meeting, the White House declined to comment on the possibility of cuts to global oil production. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would \"continue to take steps to protect American consumers.\"</p><p>\"Our focus, and it's been very clear for the past several months, has been on taking every step to ensure markets are sufficiently supplied to meet demand for a growing global economy,\" she said.</p><p>Separately, the White House said it wasn't considering making additional releases of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve beyond its current plan.</p><p>The main argument for a production cut, delegates said, is to stop oil prices from falling below $80 a barrel.</p><p>There are parallels with 1973 Arab oil embargo, when some OPEC nations decided to stop supplying the U.S. in retaliation for its support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, said Christyan Malek, the global energy head at JP Morgan.</p><p>\"Production is at risk of being restricted in favor of optimizing price and volume,\" Mr. Malek said.</p><p>The embargo initially boosted OPEC coffers but ultimately led to efforts to curb oil consumption and fueled alternative production in the West, leading to an oil-price crash in the 1980s.</p><p>OPEC+ nations also could want to undermine the EU price cap, which seeks to limit what countries can pay for Russian oil, delegates said. The combined effect of an OPEC+ production cut, in addition to the loss of Russian barrels from the price cap, could be substantial, said Helima Croft, the chief oil strategist at Canadian broker RBC.</p><p>\"There could be an explosive endgame in the oil market,\" Ms. Croft said.</p><p>Russia's support for a steep cut is a departure from its cautious position last month where the group agreed to a small reduction, its first in over a year. Moscow's representatives then advocated against forecasts of a big oil glut, which they feared would send a bearish signal. A subsequent oil price decline forced them to change tack and advocate for aggressive action, delegates said.</p><p>Even cutting production by 1.5 million barrels a day may not have a decisive effect on the world's oil supply. The 23-member OPEC+ group has been falling short of its production targets by 3 million barrels a day for most of the year.</p><p>However, OPEC delegates said a production cut could have a more meaningful impact on future oil investment.</p><p>Oil investors are betting on a decline in oil prices, with Brent contracts dated for December 2025 trading at $71 a barrel, compared with $91 today. That spread discourages oil companies from committing to spend on new production capacity, OPEC delegates said.</p><p>Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this article.</p><p>OPEC+ Girds for Contentious Meeting Over Oil-Production Cuts</p>",
