One stumbling block is likely to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc5b78ce-f730-4e92-b31d-82cedae08f08\">Democrats from affluent districts</a> including suburbs in New York, New Jersey, California and Illinois, on top of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5fd50f7-5068-4d4b-85e9-89e9be4f555b\">the predictable Republican opposition</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Biden administration has bet that tax increases on the very wealthy will not be as politically toxic as feared, and could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58f822cf-d201-4116-9b67-965f706df517\">even prove popular</a> in the wake of the big gains in equity markets during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p><em>If you are interested in reading more on the intersection of money and power in US politics </em><a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/56a64b704f693a0300dfab7e/subscribe/success\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> to </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/swamp-notes\"><em>Swamp Notes</em></a><em>, a twice-weekly newsletter written by FT columnists </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/rana-foroohar\"><em>Rana Foroohar</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/edward-luce\"><em>Edward Luce</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>US</strong> CDC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59fd0642-5cf0-4739-9d2e-e4bbbb7ea0d6\">revised its guidance</a> on wearing masks outdoors, saying it was safe for fully vaccinated people to exercise or attend small outdoor gatherings.
