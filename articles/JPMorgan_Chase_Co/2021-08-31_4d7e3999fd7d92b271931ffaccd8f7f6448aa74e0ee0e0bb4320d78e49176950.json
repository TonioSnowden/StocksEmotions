  "title": "Investors Searching for Yield Pump Up Sales of Risky Company Debt; Issuance of new collateralized loan obligations set a 10-year record in August",
  "text": "<p>This month's sales are a notable reversal from last year. Then, pandemic fears sent prices on riskier debt plummeting, halting new issuance of so-called CLOs. Broad-based support for markets from the Federal Reserve, which included cutting interest rates to near zero, injecting liquidity into markets and buying bonds, has since helped renew investor demand.</p><p>This year is now shaping up to be one of the best ever for CLOs. Based on collateral and cash balances, the size of the global market surpassed $1 trillion, according to JPMorgan. For the year as a whole, Bank of America analysts are projecting $140 billion in new U.S. CLOs sales and $220 billion in refinancings and resets, when a portfolio's maturity is extended and it is repriced.</p><p>A strong recovery in corporate earnings is helping drive investor demand for CLOs, analysts said. During the second quarter, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 21% from the same period a year earlier for public companies in the S&amp;P/LTSA leveraged-loan index.</p><p>Improving fundamentals among corporate borrowers will support leveraged-loan performance even if the U.S. economy's growth surge this year has topped out, said Joe Lynch, global head of non-investment grade credit at Neuberger Berman, which manages CLOs.</p><p>\"The outlook remains quite strong for the vast majority of issuers even if we're past peak growth,\" he said.</p><p>The rebound in earnings among loan borrowers is helping improve the ratio of debt relative to earnings, known as leverage—a key investor measure. The leverage ratio for public loan borrowers tracked by the S&amp;P/LTSA index fell to 4.92 times in the second quarter, the lowest level since June 2019.</p><p>Asset managers and other investors have turned to CLOs for relatively higher yields in recent years. Returns on CLO bonds rated double-B totaled 4.44% during the second quarter, when counting interest payments and price appreciation. That beat total returns on junk bonds and loans over the same period.</p><p>Critics say CLOs, the largest buyer of leveraged loans, allow companies to borrow more than they can support. That potentially exposes investors to losses in a downturn. A wave of credit-rating downgrades hit loans held by CLO managers last year, causing some portfolios to surpass limits on low-rated holdings.</p><p>Earlier this month, S&amp;P Global Ratings issued default ratings to two low-rated slices of CLO debt—the first defaults ever for CLOs sold after the 2008 financial crisis. The ratings company expects only a modest number of defaults to emanate from last year's market downturn mostly limited to the lowest-rated CLO securities.</p><p>The trailing 12-month default rate for junk-rated companies is expected to decline to 2.5% by June 2022, according to S&amp;P, down from 3.8% in June and 6.3% in March. That should keep investors attracted to CLOs in the near-term, said Jon Dorfman, chief investment officer at Napier Park Global Capital, which manages and invests in CLOs.</p><p>\"Falling default rates create an environment where investors are more comfortable with CLOs,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Sebastian Pellejero at sebastian.pellejero@wsj.com</p><p>Investors Searching for Yield Pump Up Sales of Risky Company Debt</p>",
