  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Deutsche Bank's Profit Jumps on Rising Rates  ----  By Patricia Kowsmann",
  "text": "<p>    Deutsche Bank AG's net profit rose sharply in the third quarter as it charged higher interest on loans and traded more currencies and bonds for clients in a volatile market. </p><p>   Bank executives struck a positive tone for the coming quarters despite a looming European recession and weakness in parts of investment banking. Similar to counterparts in the U.S. and the U.K., Germany's biggest bank set aside more money to cover possible defaults from borrowers in the quarter. </p><p>   However, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said he is confident in the strength of the bank's lending portfolio. He said deposits continue to rise, and companies and households are being supported by fiscal measures taken by the German government. </p><p>   \"Those are things that will dampen the effect of the recession and the energy crisis in 2023,\" Mr. von Moltke said. </p><p>   Profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to 1.24 billion euros, equivalent to nearly $1.24 billion, from 329 million euros a year earlier. The figure was higher than an average analyst consensus of about 1 billion euros. Revenue rose 15%. </p><p>   The bank said it was its highest third-quarter pretax profit since 2006, despite an increasingly uncertain environment. Chief Executive Christian Sewing warned costs in particular are being hit by inflation. </p><p>   \"We will therefore continue to scrutinize expenditure carefully, just as carefully as we monitor our risks in view of the difficult economic environment,\" he said. </p><p>   Inflation has been rising rapidly worldwide. To lower it, central banks are raising interest rates, which has hit companies and households with higher borrowing costs and slowed down economies. Germany is also contending with gas shortages from Russia, which is hurting energy-intensive industries. </p><p>   The uncertainty has rattled markets, casting a chill over mergers, initial public offerings and leveraged financing, a kind of riskier financing used to fund private-equity buyouts. Deutsche Bank's investment-banking business relies less on that and more on the trading of currencies and bonds, which booms in volatile times. That has helped the bank outperform Wall Street peers in recent quarters. </p><p>   The investment bank reported a 6% rise in revenue, with fixed-income trading rising 38%, offsetting a sharp fall in other business lines. Mr. von Moltke said Deutsche Bank has a 2 billion euro backlog of unsold leveraged loans, which should clear in the coming quarters as uncertainty fades. </p><p>   In its bread-and-butter business of lending, Deutsche Bank benefited from the higher interest rates it was able to charge customers and higher loan volume, as companies continued to borrow to pay for higher costs of doing business. </p><p>   Further expected rate rises from the European Central Bank will continue to lift the business. ECB policy makers are poised to raise rates again on Thursday. </p><p>   At the same time, a recession could start hitting borrowers' appetite for further loans -- and their ability to repay them. An ECB lending survey released Tuesday showed eurozone banks expect loan demand to fall in the fourth quarter. Credit standards have already tightened. </p><p>   Deutsche Bank increased provisions for bad loans in the quarter to 350 million euros, compared with 117 million euros a year earlier. But Mr. von Moltke said a chunk came from issues with specific borrowers that were unrelated to the energy crisis and prospective recession. Overall, he said, the bank's portfolio is resilient. Large global banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc., and London-based HSBC Holdings PLC have all set aside more money to cover for potential defaults. </p><p>   For 2022, the bank has promised to reach an 8% return on tangible equity -- a key metric of profitability -- and a cost-to-income ratio of up to 75%. In the third quarter, the figures stood at 8.2% and about 72%, respectively. </p><p>   Deutsche Bank shares rose 1.2% in Frankfurt. </p><p></p>",
