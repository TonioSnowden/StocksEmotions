  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6aaa86a5-d66d-4e1a-96a6-6f6eb1b30a36\">impending global food crisis</a> has been high on the agenda at the World Economic Forum, and could turn into the worst hunger catastrophe in decades.</p> <p>Since the war in Ukraine, wheat and corn prices have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/471d4513-176c-4837-a7d4-7ef2609b720a\">jumped 41 per cent and 28 cent</a> respectively, as Russia and Ukraine combined represent about 30 per cent of global wheat exports.</p> <p>Some European nations are concerned that rising food prices and shortages in the fragile emerging markets in Africa and the Middle East could lead to a humanitarian disaster and trigger another wave of migration to EU countries.</p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin told Italian prime minister Mario Draghi that Moscow could help alleviate the crisis stemming from the blockade of Ukrainian grain exports, if the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62de8720-77eb-4983-91ef-497afeb2ed6d#post-51cde008-b35a-493b-b419-d01a25ab3b25\">west eases its sanctions against Russia</a>. Putin also suggested that the country could export its own grain and fertiliser, if sanctions were lifted.</p> <p>David Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Programme, said up to 323mn people were “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55906ae0-73a4-48cf-ad51-33ea28a4e7f6\">marching towards starvation</a>” and 49mn were “knocking on famine's door” in 43 countries. Food protectionism is also a growing concern, with India announcing a ban on wheat exports this month. Beasley told Gideon Rachman: “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9402949-12e5-4cdb-b219-8446ae71c44a\">Export ban on food</a> can create havoc in the market. We ask countries not to do that.”</p> <p>This month, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the G7 group of industrialised nations was urgently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d76bbe5-1163-473b-82cf-c327f3672134\">seeking alternative routes</a> for the export of Ukrainian grain. The group also recently launched a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce2c9890-1aa2-4d56-bd4f-bcf9d4b5a0c4\">Global Alliance for Food Security</a>” with the World Bank, to co-ordinate a short-term response. The alliance aims to increase supplies of food, fertiliser and fuel and to provide financial support to help vulnerable countries avert famine.</p> <p>Food systems to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55906ae0-73a4-48cf-ad51-33ea28a4e7f6\">global crisis in agriculture</a> will also be given as much weight as energy conservation at the COP28 conference next year in the United Arab Emirates, according to a top official at the WEF. Mariam Mohammed Saeed Al Mheiri, UAE's minister of climate change and the environment, stressed that the world would need 50 per cent more food by 2050. She called for the importance of keeping markets open to prevent famine and increased efforts to cut meat consumption and food waste.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62de8720-77eb-4983-91ef-497afeb2ed6d#post-11cb4b24-0e7b-4188-b0d2-45ce7a9f3752\">Russian forces step up attacks</a> in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region</p></li>  <li><p>US inflation gauge cools in April as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62de8720-77eb-4983-91ef-497afeb2ed6d#post-306d0382-1606-4d68-93b5-f2ef4eee0e01\">Americans continue to shop</a></p></li>  <li><p>G7 urges Opec to boost output to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4addbaca-f511-4d83-8a6b-1f768ff49f21\">cool oil market</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62de8720-77eb-4983-91ef-497afeb2ed6d\"><em>visit our&#xa0;live blog</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Fiji will join the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9c268f3-3012-4dee-9dbc-137707965c89\">US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework</a> just days before China's foreign minister lands in the country, giving the Biden administration a victory in its competition with Beijing over influence in the Pacific.</p> <p>Chinese technology shares leapt today after the country's largest internet groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9753f93-4cd5-49bd-b2af-49b8b3cfc9a2\">beat first-quarter earnings estimates</a> despite the damage caused by Beijing's zero-Covid policy and widespread lockdowns in the country.

The Hib conjugate vaccine, given to children shortly after birth to protect them against Hemophilus influenzas, which can cause meningitis, has proved the most successful. Better <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c1de906-a568-4305-b710-cd4f2677b442\">diagnostic tests</a> are also crucial in the fight against antibiotic resistance to ensure drugs are used appropriately.
