  "text": "<p>I read with admiration, and hopeless longing, of Mayor Eric Adams' plea for Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan chief executive, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0fcbada-bc73-41b8-aa6b-ff81d7fe1e0c\">take the subway</a>. </p> <p>As a native New Yorker, I have always found it mystifying how the city's denizens, grand and humble alike, have resigned themselves to a state of public transit so incommensurate with the city's grandeur. </p> <p>To use the (once-disparaging) epithet “third world” to describe the condition of our infrastructure today would be an insult to developing nations. </p> <p>A wise man — a Latin American economist — once remarked that a civilised country is not a place where the poor have cars, but rather one where the rich use public transportation. Bankers as well-travelled as Dimon surely know what it's like to spend time in places where this observation applies (certainly as a rule in cities such as Zurich and Vienna, and perhaps to a lesser degree, London.)</p> <p>If the goal is indeed to get people back to work, physically, in New York the question is now whether Messrs. Adams and Dimon — as well as the rest of the city's stakeholders — believe we deserve to live in a civilised place too. </p> <p><strong>David Kaufman</strong> <br><em>Zurich, Switzerland</em> </p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this letter</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97753df9-f5cf-48b1-9b7e-e76a90144d9f\"><em>The reason Vienna is such a liveable city</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97753df9-f5cf-48b1-9b7e-e76a90144d9f\"><em>From John Doherty, Vienna, Austria</em></a></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: It's hardly surprising New Yorkers shun the subway' FT.com 19 May.
