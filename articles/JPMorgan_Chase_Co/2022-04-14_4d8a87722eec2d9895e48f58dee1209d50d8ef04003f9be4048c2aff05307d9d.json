  "title": "Wall Street's Deal-Making Boom Starts to Sputter Out; Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup all reported double-digit declines in first-quarter profit",
  "text": "<p>The highest inflation in decades and the war in Ukraine raised concerns in the first quarter about a possible recession. Commodity prices surged as the war triggered fears of energy and food shortages. Bonds and stocks both sold off, an unusual tandem move that reflected investors' worries. Corporate chiefs, who had fueled Wall Street's two-year dealmaking boom, stayed on the sidelines.</p><p>\"The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain,\" Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser said.</p><p>Investment banking fees were down 43% at Citigroup, 37% at Morgan Stanley and 36% at Goldman.</p><p>Stock underwriting businesses were hit particularly hard. The number of traditional initial public offerings dropped, and far fewer special-purpose acquisition companies reached the market. JPMorgan had its worst quarter for equity underwriting in six years.</p><p>Advisory fees were up, largely reflecting deals that had been struck last year and closed this quarter. Goldman and Morgan Stanley both said the backlog of possible future deals remains strong. But Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said that completing those deals depends on economic uncertainty abating.</p><p>While bankers struck out, trading desks cashed in on the volatility. Trading revenue was up 4% at both Goldman and Morgan Stanley. Goldman notched a 21% gain in bond trading, and Morgan Stanley recorded a 10% jump in stock trading.</p><p>At Citigroup, commodities-trading revenue nearly tripled, CFO Mark Mason said. Total fixed-income revenue, one of Citi's biggest businesses, was down slightly, which was better than what analysts had expected.</p><p>\"Inflationary and supply-chain and political tension led to increased volatility and a conducive environment for market-making,\" Mr. Mason said. \"We took advantage of that.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do Goldman's earnings say about the market as a whole? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Markets are expected to get even choppier in the coming months as the Federal Reserve moves to tame inflation, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon predicted on Wednesday. The central bank raised interest rates last month for the first time since 2018, and it is expected to continue to raise rates throughout the year.</p><p>\"I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"That could be good or bad for trading, but there's almost no chance it won't happen.\"</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell more than 1% Thursday. It has dropped sharply over the past few months, and is down about 12% for the year compared with the S&amp;P 500's 8% decline.</p><p>Citigroup and Morgan Stanley rose 1.6% and 0.8%, respectively, after reporting first-quarter results. Goldman fell by 0.1%.</p><p>Citigroup has a bigger presence in Russia, including a retail bank, than other U.S. banks. It has been racing to reduce that exposure, cutting it to $7.8 billion from $9.8 billion in December. It now says it could lose up to $3 billion, down from the nearly $5 billion it had earlier warned was possible.</p><p>The bank set aside $1 billion for potential loan losses from its exposures in Russia and another $900 million from the broader impact of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>JPMorgan said Wednesday it was budgeting for higher losses because of the war. JPMorgan also took some losses related to commodities such as nickel, which have been volatile since Moscow invaded.</p><p>Goldman said it took a $300 million hit to revenue in the first quarter due to the war's impact. Morgan Stanley said the conflict didn't have a direct impact on its business.</p><p>Bank Earnings</p><p>Read more about companies closely tied to the economy, selected by WSJ editors:</p><p>* Citigroup's First-Quarter Earnings Drop 46%</p><p>* Wells Fargo Quarterly Profit Falls 21%</p><p>* Morgan Stanley's Profit Falls 11% as Deals Slow</p><p>* JPMorgan CEO Says 'Powerful Forces' Threaten U.S. Economy (April 13)</p><p>* What JPMorgan Earnings Tell Us About Household Finances (April 13)</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Wall Street's Deal-Making Boom Starts to Sputter Out</p>",
