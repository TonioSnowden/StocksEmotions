  "title": "Extra unemployment benefits helped keep the economy afloat — here's how much they boosted spending",
  "text": "<p>But the pandemic has proven to be anything but business as usual.</p><p>&#xa0;Millions of Americans received&#xa0;an extra $600 a week in pandemic-related unemployment benefits&#xa0;from March 2020 to July 2020, and $300 from January 2021, the last of which are due to expire on Sept. 7.</p><p>Despite more than 23 million job losses during the pandemic-induced recession, those individuals didn't cut back on spending.</p><p>In the first half of 2020, median spending levels for those laid off during the pandemic were 10% higher than what they had been pre-pandemic, according to research published by the JPMorgan Chase Institute JPM this week.</p><p>The report is based on data from de-identified Chase checking account customers that date back to 2007, including some 2 million customers that experienced job loss.</p><p>Without the extra $600 in unemployment benefits, the researchers estimate that median spending levels of individuals laid off could have declined 5% to 10% compared to spending levels prior to the pandemic.</p><p>Unemployment supplements during the pandemic “really prevented jobless workers from having to cut back on spending,” said Fiona Greig, co-president of JPMorgan Chase Institute.</p><p>“We also found that low-liquidity and Black and Latinx families exhibit a stronger spending response to jobless benefits, illustrating that targeting income supports to low-liquidity families can limit welfare losses in the face of job loss and stimulate aggregate demand.”</p><p>In fact, some started spending more once it expired in July using the money they stashed away from prior weeks of unemployment benefits, separate Chase data suggests.</p><p>And now? More than 17 months into the pandemic, there remains a record 10.1 million job openings in the U.S. while some 8.7 million people remain unemployed.</p><p>More than 7 million Americans did not work during July 21 through Aug. 2 to look after children while some daycares and schools remain closed, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey.</p>",
