  "text": "<p>Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International has said it is considering exiting Russia just weeks after its chief executive said the lender, which generates a third of its profits in the country, would stay.</p> <p>Raiffeisen, which has 4.2mn customers and 9,400 staff in Russia, said on Thursday morning it was considering all options for its subsidiary following the invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>“This unprecedented situation leads RBI to consider its position in Russia. We are therefore assessing all strategic options . . . up to and including a carefully managed exit from Raiffeisenbank in Russia,” said chief executive Johann Strobl.</p> <p>Just two weeks ago, Strobl <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9592d376-de4b-47a0-b1ec-1934b65b569b\">told investors</a>: “It's very important that you understand, we are not walking away.”</p> <p>Raiffeisen has been the hardest hit of the handful of western banks with a presence in Russia. Its share price has halved in recent weeks and fell 5 per cent on Thursday morning.</p> <p>It has €22.9bn of assets in Russia, with €354mn of exposure to financial institutions that are under sanctions and €119mn to other companies under sanctions.</p> <p>It also has €4.4bn of exposure to Ukraine, half of which is lending to companies, and is the fifth-largest bank in the country with 390 branches. In Belarus, it is the fifth-largest lender, with 65 branches. </p> <p>In a call with investors and analysts on March 1, the bank said it was suspending its €1.15-a-share dividend while it assessed the impact of the invasion on its Russian and Ukrainian businesses. </p> <p>Raiffeisen has been increasing its hedging of the rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia in recent months, as well as boosting liquidity in its Russian and Ukrainian operations in expectation of mass customer withdrawals.</p> <p>But the escalation of western sanctions — and counter measures from the Kremlin — in recent weeks have made it harder for western banks to operate in Russia. </p> <p>UniCredit, another European lender with a large exposure to Russia, announced this week it was also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8723bab5-396f-465d-b3d7-63a6071e207d\">considering exiting</a>, while several big investment banks — including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank — have said they planned to leave.</p> <p>Citigroup, which has $10bn of direct exposure and 500,000 customers in Russia, has been trying to sell its subsidiary since July last year.</p> <p>Société Générale, the French lender that also has a big retail and corporate banking presence in Russia, has yet to say whether it is considering an exit.</p> <p>At a Morgan Stanley conference yesterday, SocGen chief executive Frédéric Oudéa said: “The strategic perspective of Russia has changed dramatically.</p> <p>“But the priority . . . is to ensure first, security of the staff, implementation of sanctions and reduction of risk.”</p> <p>After being badly hit in 2014 when Russia faced penalties over its annexation of Crimea, Raiffeisen inserted clauses in all its lending agreements in the country so that any clients hit by sanctions would no longer be able to draw additional credit and would have to repay existing loans.</p><p>Source: Owen Walker, European Banking Correspondent 2022 'Raiffeisen considers Russia exit just weeks after committing to stay' FT.com 17 March.
