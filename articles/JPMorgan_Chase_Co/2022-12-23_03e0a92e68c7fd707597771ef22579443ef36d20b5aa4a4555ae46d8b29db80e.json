The man behind the <strong>Fanatics</strong> sports merchandise empire has quite the jet-setting life, as chronicled in this <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/style/michael-rubin-fanatics-76ers.html\">New York Times profile</a>. </p> <p>Rubin also spent time last year with the island nation's most infamous resident, <strong>FTX</strong> founder <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>. A disclosure from the fallen crypto exchange's bankruptcy counsel on Wednesday night revealed that FTX is an investor in Fanatics, a company that<strong> Sullivan &amp; Cromwell </strong>represents.</p> <p>DD has learned some detail about the relationship between the two. According to a person familiar with the situation, Rubin and SBF met in late 2021 while Rubin was building a vacation house at the <strong>Albany Resort,</strong> the posh community where FTX had set up shop. </p> <p>Rubin put $10mn into FTX, a figure that has since been wiped out. FTX, however, put in a reciprocal $10mn into Fanatics, according to this person. The latter investment has worked out much better. </p> <p>FTX's $10mn was invested in an early 2022 fundraising that valued Fanatics at $27bn. Just weeks ago, that valuation rose to $31bn in another round that included the likes of <strong>Clearlake Capital</strong>, <strong>LionTree</strong>, <strong>SoftBank</strong> and<strong> Silver Lake Partners</strong>.</p> <p>The crypto group's Fanatics investment is now part of the FTX bankruptcy estate that the company's new boss <strong>John Ray III</strong>, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and bankers at <strong>Perella Weinberg Partners</strong> are looking to monetise in order to pay off account holders. </p> <p>Fanatics declined to comment on its relationship with FTX.</p> <p>Rubin may be spending more time in the Bahamas, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6993c3fa-6147-4cd3-9214-886d4da20d2f\">but SBF won't be</a>. After arriving in New York and being taken into federal custody on Thursday, a judge set a $250mn bond for him that requires his presence at his parents' home in Palo Alto, California. </p> <p>Two of his closest associates, <strong>Caroline Ellison </strong>and<strong> Gary Wang</strong>, also won't be returning anytime soon. The pair have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15669bd0-7b9f-4ca2-af19-038230b718ab\">pleaded guilty</a> to fraud charges and agreed to co-operate with US authorities.</p> <h1>How Adidas dropped the ball</h1> <p>The year is 2016. <strong>Kanye West</strong>'s <em>Fade</em> is dominating the airwaves and drops of the rapper-turned-designer's Yeezy sneaker collaboration with <strong>Adidas</strong> are selling so fast that merchants <a href=\"https://blog.sneakersnstuff.com/important-information-regarding-the-adidas-yeezy-boost-350-v2-release-at-sneakersnstuff-com/?utm_source=CJ&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=6157042\">estimate</a> only 0.25 per cent of hopeful customers will get their hands on a pair.</p> <p>How the mighty have fallen. The rapper, who now goes by Ye, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6afc875f-424d-4f7b-a201-f6b6aee50eee\">has come out as a Hitler apologist</a> on an anti-Semitic tirade <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b599b38c-c25f-4624-ac9e-c057befba350\">that has inspired</a> other hateful language and acts. That prompted Adidas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0377b06-ac8e-4f61-9741-0c759df4d98e\">to cut ties</a> with its most profitable business partner.</p> <p>The end of the partnership has contributed to a 54 per cent drop in Adidas' share price in the past year. But the retailer had been <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/eec3746b-11de-476b-a609-1d135992ba47\">confronting deep-seated issues</a> within its organisation long before its most recent crisis, the FT's Eleanor Olcott and Olaf Storbeck report.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/12227625.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In interviews with 17 current and former executives, many of whom have left the company, who said outgoing chief <strong>Kasper Rørsted</strong> and its board had positioned Adidas poorly to weather the West storm, firing key personnel and becoming over-reliant on the Yeezy collaboration. </p> <p>They also claimed the outgoing chief's “management by fear” had traumatised staff and led to an exodus of talent. </p> <p>Rørsted's successor, longstanding<strong> Puma</strong> boss <strong>Björn Gulden</strong>, has now been tasked with confronting the widening gap between Adidas and its rivals.</p> <p>The debacle has made clear the risks of becoming too dependent on a single partner. As<strong> Citi</strong> analyst<strong> Thomas Chauvet</strong> put it last month: “A whole Adidas brand reset is probably needed.”</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Dan Berkovitz</strong>, general counsel of the US<strong> Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, will leave the agency at the end of January.<strong> Megan Barbero</strong>, currently SEC principal deputy general counsel, will take his place.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Stephanie Bruce</strong>, the chief financial officer of<strong> Abrdn</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-22/abrdn-cfo-bruce-to-leave-after-turbulent-period-at-asset-manager\">is planning to leave</a> the asset manager in the coming months, according to Bloomberg, after what has been a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/476bf108-3743-4da8-8622-5760fd2c1538\">challenging period</a> for the group.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Tesla</strong> has sent its China boss <strong>Tom Zhu</strong> to the US to help address production engineering challenges in the region, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sends-shanghai-boss-aides-jumpstart-us-output-2022-12-21/\">fuelling speculation</a> that he's being primed for a bigger role as the electric carmaker's CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has been distracted with Twitter, per Reuters.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>The ER elite </strong>A special room in New York University's busy Manhattan emergency department is dedicated to two kinds of patients: those whose lives are on the line, and VIPs.
