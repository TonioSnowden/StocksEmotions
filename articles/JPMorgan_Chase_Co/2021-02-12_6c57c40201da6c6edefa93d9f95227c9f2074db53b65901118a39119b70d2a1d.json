  "text": "<p>We have seen pretty much every take imaginable -- about hedge-fund managers, trading apps and lonely men in their basements. Politicians are calling for investigations by congressional committees and regulators. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reportedly convened a meeting to discuss the matter with the leaders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve. The Journal reported on Thursday that the Justice Department -- including prosecutors from the office where I used to work -- has opened a criminal investigation into potential market manipulation. The CFTC has opened a parallel civil investigation and the SEC has begun reviewing social media and Reddit posts possibly intended to inflate GameStop's stock price, potentially as part of a \"pump and dump\" scheme.</p><p>The frenzy recalls the intense media coverage of the so-called flash crash on May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a precipitous 30-minute drop that briefly wiped out roughly a trillion dollars in value. The Washington Post invoked the episode as a cautionary tale. Politico similarly noted that GameStop \"may trigger the most political attention to the mechanics of stock trading since the 2010 'flash crash.'\"</p><p>This is probably true, but not in a way that is heartening. The U.S. government's haphazard and deeply confused response to the flash crash -- the effects of which remain with us to this day -- should serve as a warning about the risks of overreaction to what should be a niche market story.</p><p>Like GameStop, the flash crash prompted commentary and media attention across ideological lines, as well as calls for congressional hearings and government interventions. We learned months later from the SEC and CFTC -- in what remains the best account of the episode -- that the cause was likely a poorly placed order from a large fund that happened to coincide with unusual market conditions.</p><p>But some market participants and government officials remained eager to pin the blame on larger forces. As the journalist Liam Vaughan recounts in his sharp and engaging book on the subject, a trader in Chicago eventually decided to point the finger at a then-unknown trader in London named Navinder Sarao. The \"whistleblower\" report caught the attention of lawyers at the CFTC and, eventually, prosecutors at the Justice Department. The theory was that Mr. Sarao had caused the crash by \"spoofing\" -- rapidly placing and canceling orders on one side of a market to move the price toward an order placed on the other side.</p><p>Mr. Vaughan reports that the CFTC's own expert -- a finance professor from Berkeley -- wasn't persuaded, but Mr. Sarao was nevertheless charged in an indictment that alleged spoofing, fraud and market manipulation. The claim that he had caused the flash crash predictably generated a lot of publicity for the government and its lawyers, who, according to Mr. Vaughan, often \"joked about who was going to play them in the inevitable movie.\"</p><p>Subsequent events attracted far less attention as the case fizzled out. A group of well-regarded academics concurred with the CFTC expert that the government's claim about Mr. Sarao was wrong. He pleaded guilty to two charges but never admitted that he caused the flash crash, and in January 2020 he was sentenced to a year of home detention.</p><p>Things might have stopped with Mr. Sarao, but the prosecution turned out to be the start of a yearslong antispoofing crackdown by the Justice Department. Before I left the department early last year, I contributed to the effort by charging two traders at Merrill Lynch and completing a settlement with Bank of America. I also secured the two court rulings that eventually allowed Justice to obtain a monetary settlement from J.P. Morgan.</p><p>But the government's expenditure of time and resources on the initiative -- the data analysis alone has cost more than $5.8 million -- has been grossly disproportionate to whatever benefit it is expected to produce. The government has obtained eight guilty pleas, but two of the three trials resulted in acquittals, and the third -- a case against two former Deutsche Bank traders that ended last September -- resulted in acquittals of the most significant charges and convictions only on minor counts.</p><p>Meanwhile, the available evidence suggests that the victims of spoofing are largely high-frequency trading firms. At the last trial, the government offered testimony from witnesses on behalf of only two victims -- Citadel Securities and Quantlab -- both of which are extremely profitable companies. That doesn't make it acceptable to break the law, but the government has limited resources to fight financial crimes and must make thoughtful decisions about when and how it deploys its criminal and regulatory enforcement apparatus. By throwing the kitchen sink at spoofers, is the Justice Department attending to the full spectrum of the economic interests of individuals and businesses in a complex and diverse economy?</p><p>No one really knows what happened to GameStop. It could have been a decentralized effort by some combination of sophisticated investors and dilettantes like Dave Portnoy to prop up the company's stock, or it could have been a pump-and-dump scheme, which is already illegal.</p><p>For now, perhaps the best thing the government can do is nothing. Take a deep breath, study what happened, and resist the urge to take hasty action. Politicians and pundits will be keen to use the episode as a vehicle for policy changes they already wanted, but as the flash crash continues to show us, the risk of overreacting -- with ill-advised regulatory or enforcement initiatives -- is likely much greater than whatever short-term harm results from the ups and downs of a handful of stocks.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Khardori is a former federal prosecutor who specialized in financial fraud.</p>",
