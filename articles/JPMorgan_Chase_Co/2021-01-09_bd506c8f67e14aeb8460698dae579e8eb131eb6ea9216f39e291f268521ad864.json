  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: NCR Bids To Snatch An ATM Operator",
  "text": "<p>The move sets up a potential bidding war for a company that operates 285,000 ATMs in 10 countries, according to its website.</p><p>Houston-based Cardtronics on Dec. 15 announced a deal to be sold to Apollo and investment firm Hudson Executive Capital LP for $35 a share. Hudson Executive owns a roughly 19% stake in Cardtronics. Its founder, former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. finance chief Douglas Braunstein, sits on its board and has recused himself from sale discussions, the company has said.</p><p>Atlanta-based NCR, formerly known as National Cash Register and once owned by AT&amp;T Inc., makes ATMs as well as point-of-sale systems and self-service kiosks for businesses such as retailers and restaurants. Similar to other hardware makers, it has been pivoting its business toward software sales and other recurring services.</p><p>This isn't the first time Apollo has recently been faced with a competing offer for a publicly traded company it had agreed to buy. In late 2019, the private-equity firm raised its offer for Tech Data Corp. after the technology distributor received a bid from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Apollo's deal for Tech Data closed in June of last year.</p>",
