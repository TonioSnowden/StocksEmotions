  "title": "Free Trading's Costs Come Into Focus --- GameStop mania highlights downside for online brokerages, though large firms can still benefit",
  "text": "<p>A surge of activity in 2020 helped set trading-volume records for many brokers and collectively brought millions of new accounts, driven by a buoyant market and commission-free trading. But this past week's frenzy around GameStop and other stocks highlighted some potential downsides of this small-trader wave.</p><p>Moves by some trading platforms including Robinhood Markets to restrict some trading at times drew scrutiny from customers and politicians. Even shares of far bigger firms, such Charles Schwab, which owns TD Ameritrade, and Morgan Stanley, which owns E*Trade, were sold off sharply last week.</p><p>Those shares have rallied so far this week. But the question investors may be considering is whether a sustained explosion of trading is good for the online-trading business.</p><p>From a revenue standpoint, the absence of commissions and little return on customer cash due to superlow interest rates increases reliance on other revenue sources, like margin lending and payment-for-order flow. So called PFOF in particular, which involves sending customers' trading orders to wholesale market-making firms, drew attention over the past week. Whether warranted or not, regulatory changes or customer demands that limit this revenue source could make volume much less valuable.</p><p>The events of last week reveal another potential pressure on the trading business: liquidity and capital requirements. In its move to restrict some buying, Robinhood cited a 10-fold increase in the amount of cash it needed on deposit at the clearinghouse for settling trades. It raised more than $3 billion in new equity. To the extent future GameStop-like volatility and trade-flow imbalances are likely going forward, it raises the possibility that more capital and cash are just part of running a retail trading business, putting pressure on returns. Lawmakers may want to revisit requirements, too.</p><p>It is simply not cheap to handle this level of activity. Schwab executives on Tuesday noted a trend of increases in client servicing and expenses related to things like volumes and new-account openings. However, the company said it is confident in its merger cost-synergy targets with TD Ameritrade, and it expects trading volumes to moderate from pandemic levels over the longer term.</p><p>Some changes coming from this period could be helpful for brokers if Robinhood's call for instant-settlement at clearinghouses is heeded, seen as a way to reduce potential liquidity pressures. But short of that kind of structural change, normalization of activity is exactly what investors should hope to see.</p><p>For investment giants such as Schwab and Morgan Stanley, or a big retail bank that beefed up its trading offering like JPMorgan Chase, or fintech upstarts like Social Finance or Square, the lure of trading remains a good vehicle for acquiring young customers. If these customers join up with firms' larger platforms to do more investing, spending or banking with them, then they will be worth any potential trading headaches, especially once interest rates start to rise and the yields on loans and cash jump. But after the past several days, it is getting harder to see free trading as a good business unto itself.</p>",
