  "text": "<p>Banks need loan growth to offset the effect of low interest rates and the drag of huge deposit inflows sitting in cash on their balance sheets. Many banks' credit-card portfolios plunged during 2020 as consumers spent less and paid down debt.</p><p>Spending by bank customers certainly is picking up. Bank of America said the first quarter was its highest ever for overall consumer spending. The vast bulk of that increase still is coming via debit cards, which don't add to card-loan balances, though the first quarter did start to register growth in credit-card spending versus the comparable period in 2019.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase said that even travel-and-entertainment spending was up 50% in March versus February, and Citigroup logged recovery in areas including travel and dining.</p><p>And yet banks so far still aren't forecasting much more than a tepid uptick in consumer borrowing in the near future. In fact, the impressive size of banks' reserve releases is indicative of how strong their customers' balance sheets are.</p><p>These banks' customers aren't necessarily representative of the population of Americans hardest hit by the pandemic, who have a huge need for both cash and borrowing today but often don't meet the lending standards of the biggest banks. But among its customers, Bank of America is seeing roughly only 30% of incoming stimulus money spent, with the rest sitting in accounts. U.S. Bancorp said that average card loans fell in the first quarter from the fourth in part due to \"government stimulus payments used to pay down debt.\"</p><p>A similar thing is happening in mortgages, where despite rising rates, a wave of early paydowns via refinancing was still a drag on interest income.</p><p>Bank of America said its quarterly net interest income could increase by as much as $1 billion by the fourth quarter, from around $10 billion in each of the past two quarters. That forecast relies on modest loan growth and a slowing of mortgage paydowns, the bank said. JPMorgan said that the bank anticipated some consumer loan growth in the second half of the year.</p><p>There are some green-shoot indicators for credit cards. Bank of America said the pace of new quarterly card openings in the first quarter was at around 60% of what it was pre-pandemic, and rising.</p><p>That is up from a nadir of closer to 40% of pre-pandemic levels. A return to somewhat easier pre-pandemic underwriting criteria and reopening branches is helping.</p><p>For now, though, lenders are still waiting to see if consumers will pick up where they left off with credit cards before the pandemic.</p>",
