  "title": "Gas Prices Are Surging, Demand Is Slipping Ahead of Memorial Day Weekend; Record-high prices are pinching Americans' pockets ahead of what is usually peak summer driving season",
  "text": "<p>Oliver Zapata Ramirez—a 25-year-old video editor at a production company in Columbus, Ohio—says he has cut his driving by about 300 miles a month since March because of high gas prices. He bikes or takes the bus when possible, including commuting to his office, which is about 3 miles from his home.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What impact have higher gas prices had on your travel plans? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"I try my best not to drive right now,\" said Mr. Zapata Ramirez, noting it costs him $50 to fill half a tank of gas in his 2006 Kia Sportage. That lasts about a week, he said.</p><p>Gasoline demand, measured on a four-week rolling average through May 20, fell to 8.8 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Excluding 2020's steep drop in demand during pandemic lockdowns, the last time average demand for this time of year was lower was in 2013.</p><p>The skittishness comes as gas prices continue to rise. The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. reached $4.60 on Thursday, a 51% increase from a year ago and a new all-time high. Prices rose above $4 a gallon, on average, in all 50 states last week.</p><p>Analysts anticipate that prices won't fall soon. A report from JPMorgan this month said retail gas prices could jump to $6.20 a gallon by August.</p><p>\"A big part of why we aren't seeing higher demand is that people are thinking more about how to reduce their consumption\" due to high gas prices, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.</p><p>May is when gas demand generally ramps up, as the weather warms up and Americans gear up for road trips and other travel around Memorial Day weekend. AAA predicted earlier this month that Memorial Day travel this year would return to prepandemic levels.</p><p>Even amid the recent dip in gasoline demand, analysts note that people are itching to travel more now than they did during the first two years of the pandemic. Household savings rates are high and unemployment is low, two factors that can help people withstand high gas prices.</p><p>Mr. De Haan said there currently isn't the same amount of consumer anxiety over gas prices as there was during the financial crisis, when gas prices jumped sharply in 2008. Adjusted for inflation, gas prices then were higher than they are today, Mr. De Haan said.</p><p>\"I don't think we're [at] that fever pitch level of consumers ditching cars and inconveniencing themselves because gas prices are too high,\" he said.</p><p>Gas prices have risen in recent months following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted the global oil market. The European Union's recent discussion of pulling back from buying Russian oil has sent additional shock waves through an already strained oil market.</p><p>Several states have suspended their gas taxes, including Georgia, whose governor on Thursday extended its gas tax suspension through mid-July.</p><p>The Biden administration has also tried to stem the rise in gas prices. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyissued an emergency waiverin April that allows gas stations to sell high-ethanol content gasoline this summer, despite concerns about increasing air-polluting emissions.</p><p>The Biden administration has alsotapped oil suppliesfrom the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, releasing 1 million barrels of oil a day. But gas prices continue to rise.</p><p>Mr. Zapata Ramirez, the Kia Sportage driver, said he plans to move to New York City in June. He said he is moving because he wants better access to public transportation and to live closer to friends.</p><p>\"I'm kind of hoping to sell my car or leave it with my parents,\" Mr. Zapata Ramirez said.</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com</p><p>Gas Prices Are Surging, Demand Is Slipping Ahead of Memorial Day Weekend</p>",
