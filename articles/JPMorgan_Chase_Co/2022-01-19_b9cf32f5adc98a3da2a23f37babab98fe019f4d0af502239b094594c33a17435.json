  "text": "<p>Bank of America said its annual profit reached an all-time high in 2021 and gave a bullish outlook for the year to come in anticipation of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb684de4-fa00-4791-a062-fdcd737a08d2\">multiple interest rate increases</a> by the Federal Reserve and a revival in lending.</p> <p>Quarterly profit at the second-largest US bank by assets jumped 28 per cent to $7bn as both its wealth management and investment banking divisions reported record revenues.</p> <p>Most large US banks have struggled to grow their revenue from their core business of making loans after the Fed dropped interest rates to rock-bottom levels and cash infusions from stimulus programmes left many consumers and companies with little need to borrow.</p> <p>However, BofA registered double-digit increases in net-interest income for a second consecutive quarter by investing deposits in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0731c2ad-2e33-4023-a35e-a4fcdbc49c17\">debt securities</a> at a faster pace than its megabank peers. Net-interest income rose 11 per cent to $11.4bn in the fourth quarter, while average loan balances across the bank inched 1 per cent higher.</p> <p>With investors now pricing in four interest rate rises this year and loan growth starting to accelerate, BofA expects “robust” net-interest income growth for the year, said Alastair Borthwick, chief financial officer, on a call with journalists.</p> <p>Excluding loans from the government-backed Paycheck Protection Program, year-end loan balances were 8 per cent higher at $974bn.</p> <p>“I'd say we're pretty optimistic on loan growth,” Borthwick said. “Probably more optimistic than we might be at the beginning of a normal year pre-pandemic.”</p> <p>BofA also plans to hold its 2022 expenses at 2021 levels in contrast to rivals that warned shareholders of higher expenses when they reported earnings earlier this month.</p> <p>Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83fea40d-eae7-4386-be34-013ed963589e\">Goldman Sachs</a> both reported double-digit increases in expenses and warned 2022 spending would likely be even higher to keep up with wage inflation and fintech competitors.</p> <p>Brian Moynihan, BofA's chief executive, has spent most of the past decade slashing costs at the bank while earmarking at least $3bn a year for new technology projects. The strategy has helped the bank roll out industry-leading technology such as its chatbot, Erica, while expenses have fallen roughly $20bn since he unveiled his cost-cutting plan in 2011.</p> <p>The bank said it planned to keep its annual technology development budget steady at about $3.5bn. “I feel like the results of our technology investments are there for people to see,” Borthwick said.</p> <p>Fourth-quarter expenses rose 6 per cent to $14.7bn compared with last year, driven by higher performance-based pay in its investment bank and wealth management divisions.</p> <p>Investment banking fees jumped 26 per cent from a year ago to $2.4bn, and wealth management revenue rose 16 per cent to $5.4bn as clients invested an additional $491bn with the bank.</p> <p>BofA reported overall earnings of 82 cents a share, up from 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue jumped 10 per cent to $22.1bn. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast earnings of 77 cents on $22.18bn in revenue.</p><p>Source: Imani Moise in New York 2022 'Bank of America projects ‘robust' interest income growth as loans rebound' FT.com 19 January.
