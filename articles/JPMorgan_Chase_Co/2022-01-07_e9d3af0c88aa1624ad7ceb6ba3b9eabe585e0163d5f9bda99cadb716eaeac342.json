Morgan: Likely September Start for Shrinking Fed's Balance Sheet</p><p>The Federal Reserve will likely allow its nearly $8.8 trillion balance sheet to begin shrinking in September, according to J.P. Morgan economists. In the wake of the release of hawkish minutes for the December Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed will probably let $100 billion of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities run off each month, the economists also wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. That would be a rate more than double the Fed's last balance sheet contraction, but it would be notably slower than the $120 billion-a-month pace of asset purchases that dominated most of the balance sheet expansion.</p><p>—Michael S. Derby</p><p>Commentary</p><p>Inflation and the ‘Experience Economy'</p><p>The U.S. needs to recognize experiences as the distinct economic offering they are and accurately take them into account in its statistics, including how the standard market basket has shifted toward them, B.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 1.7% increase in November. (Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>Brazil's industrial output fell 0.2% in November from the prior month, the sixth consecutive decline, and dropped 4.4% from a year earlier, the country's statistics agency said. (DJN)</p><p>Eurozone consumer and business confidence fell in December to the lowest level since May as the increase in Covid-19 infections weighed on the services sector. The European Commission said that its economic sentiment indicator, an aggregate measure of business and consumer confidence, fell to 115.3 in December from 117.6 in November. (DJN)</p><p>German industrial production fell slightly in November missing forecasts for an increase, as supply-chain bottlenecks and rising producer prices continue to take their toll on production. Total industrial output--comprising production in manufacturing, energy and construction--declined 0.2% on month in November in calendar-adjusted terms, statistics office Destatis said. (DJN)</p><p>German exports increased in November but at a slower pace than imports, narrowing the trade surplus, Germany's statistics office Destatis said. Exports rose 1.7% on month in adjusted terms. Imports increased 3.3% on month, Destatis said. The figures account for seasonal swings and calendar effects.
