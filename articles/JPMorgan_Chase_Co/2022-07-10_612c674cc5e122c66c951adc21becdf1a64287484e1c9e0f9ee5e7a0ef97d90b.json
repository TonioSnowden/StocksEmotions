  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week,</p> <p>In this year of significant elections, the UK has the most significant election this week, but one that is only open to a few hundred backbench Westminster MPs. It is the vote to refresh the Conservative party's parliamentary governance body, the 1922 committee.</p> <p>The first task for the new group of 18 backbench Tory MPs after Monday's plebiscite will be to agree the rules for the election of their party's new leader (ie the British prime minister). This is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87af8858-e427-47f9-b801-be7a50f65d6e\">expected to be completed by September</a>. A clutch of MPs have already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a800374-7894-431d-ad54-5e4723a82512\">thrown their hat into the ring</a>, but these could be whittled down to a shortlist of two in a matter of days, according to the FT's parliamentary team.</p> <p>The timetable for deciding the new PM is important and serious, with UK inflation the highest in the G7 and the country's growth next year (if it grows at all) forecast to be the slowest, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ac7e454-5a0c-4094-90af-fb54404d45a0\">according to the IMF</a>. There is a critical need for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b289bc7-d0f9-4e82-af0b-4270aa0b0461\">someone competent</a> to guide the country through the intervening period before the general public gets to decide its government again through a general election.</p> <p>Also, the British summer of discontent rolls on. If anything, it is gaining momentum. Criminal law barristers will walk out again on Monday, for reasons explained in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55317bbb-706f-40b5-8125-3ee2f023816f\">this piece from a legal insider</a>. Further train trouble is on the cards with the unions Aslef, representing train drivers, and TSSA, representing more than 6,000 Network Rail staff, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4203c6db-0c98-44c4-9a91-acfa227c313a\">balloting for strike action</a>. And on Friday, a ballot for industrial action closes for University and College Union members in a separate dispute over low pay, unmanageable workloads and professional respect. This could lead to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fe696d5-2498-4efa-a7d3-7925bf2459d1\">further disruption</a> for students at UK universities and colleges once this long hot summer of unrest is over.</p> <p>Thank you again for the comments about this newsletter.

Also, Croatia is being accepted as the latest member of the eurozone group.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>US banks will kick off the American earnings season this week, with bumper results forecast thanks to the Fed's run of interest rate increases. Analysts expect <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, <strong>Bank of America</strong> and <strong>Citigroup</strong> to see growth in net interest income, the difference between what banks pay depositors and what they earn from loans and other assets.</p> <p>The big fear is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/736f82b8-932c-408a-bc14-1fadf2f14aa9\">recession</a>. Banks are typically the hardest hit stocks during downturns. When trouble appears on the horizon, the pressure builds to increase capital reserves in case existing loans turn bad.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Italy, May retail sales figures</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Germany, ZEW economic sentiment survey</p></li>  <li><p>India, June consumer price index (CPI) data and May industrial production figures</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, June producer price index (PPI) data</p></li>  <li><p>Opec monthly oil market report</p></li>  <li><p>UK, British Retail Consortium and KPMG June retail sales report</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Grafton Group</strong> H1 trading update, <strong>PepsiCo</strong> Q2</p></li> </ul> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Canada, Bank of Canada's monetary policy committee meets to set rates</p></li>  <li><p>China, June trade figures</p></li>  <li><p>EU, May industrial production data</p></li>  <li><p>France, final June CPI figures</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, final June CPI figures</p></li>  <li><p>New Zealand, Reserve Bank of New Zealand monetary policy committee meets</p></li>  <li><p>South Korea, rate-setting meeting</p></li>  <li><p>UK, JMay GDP figures plus May trade and services output data</p></li>  <li><p>US, June CPI figures plus Federal Reserve publishes its latest Beige Book on current economic conditions</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>JD Wetherspoon</strong> FY, <strong>PageGroup</strong> Q2 trading update</p></li> </ul> <h2>Thursday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, European Commission publishes its summer economic forecasts</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, May industrial production figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors monthly residential market survey</p></li>  <li><p>US, June PPI data</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> trading update, <strong>Ericsson</strong> Q2, <strong>Experian</strong> Q1 trading update, <strong>Ferrovial</strong> H1, <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> Q2, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> Q2, <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> Q2 operations review, <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> trading update</p></li> </ul> <h2>Friday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Canada, May wholesale trade data</p></li>  <li><p>China, Q2 GDP figures and June retail sales and industrial production data</p></li>  <li><p>EU, May goods trade figures</p></li>  <li><p>India, trade statistics</p></li>  <li><p>Italy, June CPI figures</p></li>  <li><p>Poland, June CPI figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, June company and individual insolvency figures</p></li>  <li><p>US, June food services and retail sales data</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Bank of New York Mellon</strong> Q2, <strong>BlackRock</strong> Q2, <strong>Burberry</strong> Q1 trading update, <strong>Citigroup</strong> Q2, <strong>Svenska Handelsbanken</strong> H1, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> Q2</p></li> </ul> <h1>World events</h1> <p>Finally, here is a rundown of other events and milestones this week. </p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, eurozone finance ministers to meet in Brussels</p></li>  <li><p>UK, continuation of strike action by criminal law barristers in England and Wales over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55317bbb-706f-40b5-8125-3ee2f023816f\">cuts to legal aid</a>.
