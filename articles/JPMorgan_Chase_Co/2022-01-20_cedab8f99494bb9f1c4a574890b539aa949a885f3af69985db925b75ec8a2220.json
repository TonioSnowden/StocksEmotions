  "title": "TIAA Offers Annuity Product for Corporate 401(k) Retirement Plans; Money managers including BlackRock and AllianceBernstein are moving to meet demand for guaranteed lifetime income",
  "text": "<p>Others that have begun selling or announced plans to launch offerings that incorporate annuities include BlackRock Inc., AllianceBernstein LP, State Street Global Advisors, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.</p><p>Most are incorporating annuities into target-date funds, which attract a large percentage of every dollar that flows into 401(k) plans because the funds often serve as default investments for plans that automatically enroll workers.</p><p>TIAA said employers could offer its annuity product in default target-date portfolios or managed accounts, which are diversified stock and bond portfolios paired with advice from humans. The annuity would replace a portion of the fixed-income holding, with the option to annuitize.</p><p>In all of these uses, employees' contributions would be invested in TIAA's bond-heavy diversified investment account.</p><p>Called the TIAA Secure Income Account, the product is similar to TIAA's flagship fixed annuity, known as TIAA Traditional. TIAA has paid more than $500 billion to millions of educators and nonprofit employees since its founding in 1918, said Colbert Narcisse, TIAA's chief product and business development officer.</p><p>Lifetime-income offerings are starting to take off in the 401(k) market in the wake of a 2019 law that protects employers that follow certain procedures from being sued if they select an insurer that later fails to make annuity payments.</p><p>BlackRock, which manages more than $400 billion in target-date funds, said six employers have committed to incorporating its LifePath Paycheck, a target-date fund paired with annuities, into their 401(k) plans. AllianceBernstein has some employers using its target-date fund with an annuity, and State Street has one big client so far doing so.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How might 401(k) income options change your retirement planning? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Employers are also beginning to offer low-price annuities to their employees outside their 401(k) plans. These pay higher monthly income than employees typically can get in the individual annuities market. According to the investment-consulting firm Callan LLC, about 12% of employers offer a service through which retirees can purchase these annuities, up from 1.9% in 2015.</p><p>So far 5% let workers allocate money to a guaranteed-income product within the 401(k) plan, up from 2.7% in 2007, Callan said.</p><p>In TIAA's new product, as with its longstanding one for the core customer base, participants' contributions are protected against loss of principal and are guaranteed to grow, Mr. Narcisse said. Turning the annuity into monthly income for life isn't required; employees can treat it like other fixed-income holdings, withdrawing money just as they would from their other 401(k) holdings.</p><p>Write to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com and Anne Tergesen at anne.tergesen@wsj.com</p><p>TIAA Offers Annuity Product for Corporate 401(k) Retirement Plans</p>",
