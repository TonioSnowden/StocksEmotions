  "text": "<p>But as restrictions eased and vaccines became widely available, certain consumer behaviors tilted back to prepandemic norms. More people returned to bricks-and-mortar stores and bought less online. That shift represents a new threat to some of the businesses that thrived for much of 2020 and 2021.</p><p>In the past week, streaming giant Netflix Inc. and online car seller Carvana Co. signaled that their businesses slowed, joining others that trimmed their growth targets. Netflix shares just wrapped up their worst week since 2004, and shares of Carvana aredown 64% for the year through Friday.</p><p>The prospect of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve is also sapping appetite investors had for these once highflying stocks. They may look too expensive to own as the U.S. economy increasingly reopens.</p><p>In fact, some investors say the recent declines in the stocks that performed during the stay-at-home era signal that the pandemic's hottest trade may have shot up too far and too fast.</p><p>Here is a look at the fates of 10 pandemic-era favorites:</p><p>Netflix: Netflix investors are changing the channel. The streaming service saw its subscriber count and stock price hit new heights during the pandemic, as viewers binge-watched movies and TV shows while stuck indoors. But the company on Tuesday reported its first quarterly subscriber loss in more than a decade. It said it expects to lose two million more subscribers in the current quarter as it grapples with competition from rival streaming services and password-sharing among its customers. Netflix shares fell 35% on Wednesday, their second-worst one-day decline on record, erasing $54 billion in market value.</p><p>Peloton Interactive: Peloton is no longer riding high. The at-home fitness equipment maker was a breakout success during the pandemic as closed gyms and lockdowns fueled massive demand for its exercise bikes. But the company struggled as people ventured back outside, lowering its revenue forecasts and cutting 20% of its staff. Activist investor Blackwells Capital LLC pushed Peloton's board to fire its CEO and pursue a sale. New Chief Executive Barry McCarthy plans to increase the company's focus on digital and reduce its reliance on hardware sales. The company, which once boasted a market value of more than $50 billion, is now worth less than $7 billion.</p><p>Etsy: Will Etsy craft a postpandemic recovery? Business boomed for the online marketplace as more consumers shopped from home in the early days of the pandemic. But the return of some shoppers to bricks-and-mortar stores triggered a slowdown. Growth in Etsy's active buyers started to decelerate in the first quarter of 2021. Now, as the company gears up to take on competitors like Amazon.com Inc., it faces resistance from some sellers. More than 20,000 sellers signed a petition protesting higher commission fees, which Etsy said will help fund investments in marketing and expand seller-support services.</p><p>Carvana: Carvana is slowing down. The online used-car dealer on Wednesday reported its first-ever decline in quarterly sales and said it planned to sell $2 billion in common and preferred stock. The onetime pandemic darling expanded rapidly over the past two years, roughly doubling its quarterly sales volume since the spring of 2020. But rising interest rates, falling used-car prices and inflation-wary customers upended Carvana's growth plans, while logistics backlogs caused the company to cut purchases of vehicles from consumers. Carvana shares are down about 18% in the past three trading days and nearly 80% since their peak last summer.</p><p>Clorox: Clorox is no longer cleaning up. Sales surged early in the pandemic as the company struggled to keep up with Americans' demand for its namesake cleaning products. But the disinfecting frenzy abated, as did demand for the company's once-hard-to-find wipes and sprays. As inflation weighs on consumers, analysts say shoppers are buying household products in smaller quantities and switching to less expensive store-name brands. The company said it is counting on price increases this year to improve margins and profitability. Clorox shares have fallen about 17% since April 2021.</p><p>Moderna: Moderna shot to the top during the global race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. Its vaccine is the second most used in the U.S., behind the one developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. But Moderna now faces an increasingly crowded market, along with concerns from investors about how long vaccine sales will remain robust. The company expects people will need another booster dose by fall of this year to sustain protection, particularly from the Omicron variant. Moderna's shares soared in 2021, setting a record in August, but they have since fallen 71%. The stock still remains well above prepandemic levels.</p><p>PayPal Holdings: A surge in online shopping over the course of the pandemic boosted PayPal's transaction volumes and profits, sending its market value at one point higher than all U.S. banks other than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. But payments began to ebb as lockdowns eased and in-store sales recovered. In February, PayPal lowered its 2022 profit outlook and scrapped an ambitious growth strategy it put in place last year. Executives said among the forces pressuring its business this year are the runoff in government stimulus, labor shortages, inflation and supply-chain problems. Shares are down 72% from July's peak.</p><p>Domino's Pizza: Investors no longer have the same appetite for Domino's Pizza. A flood of delivery and takeout orders boosted the pizza chain's shares when restaurants closed their dining rooms during the early stages of the pandemic. But U.S. same-store sales dropped for the first time in a decade in the fourth quarter, hurt by restaurant reopenings, ongoing staffing issues and higher costs for gasoline and food. The company has even allowed customers who pick up their orders in stores to claim a $3 tip due to an ongoing delivery-driver shortage. Shares have pulled back 33% from their December 2021 record.</p><p>Campbell Soup: Campbell Soup's shares are cooling down. Its U.S. soup sales surged in early 2020 as consumers sought comfort food. But sales dropped in the most recent quarter as more consumers enjoyed meals out. The 150-year-old company also faces inflationary pressures and surging costs tied to ingredients, packaging, logistics and labor. Campbell is looking to boost its appeal to younger customers by embarking on a long-overdue refresh of products, including simplified ingredients and modernized packaging. The company's shares are down 13% from their March 2020 highs.</p><p>Zoom: Zoom is not connecting like it was in 2020. Thanks to the pandemic, Zoom became a household name, and its stock hit an all-time high in October 2020. But as more workers return to the office, Zoom's future rate of growth isn't clear in a competitive market for video-conference calls. In the most recent quarter, the company's sales growth slowed to 21%, the smallest gain on record. Zoom is also struggling to expand after its nearly $15 billion attempted acquisition of contact center company Five9 Inc. was blocked in September by the selling shareholders. Shares are nearly back to prepandemic levels, down about 82% from their record.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
