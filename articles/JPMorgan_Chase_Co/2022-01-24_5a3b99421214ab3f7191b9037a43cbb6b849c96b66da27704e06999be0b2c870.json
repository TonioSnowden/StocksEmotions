  "title": "Banking  Stocks Are  Diverging  In 2022  ----  By Charley Grant",
  "text": "<p>   After three weeks of trading in the new year, the big bank stocks are all over the place. </p><p>    Wells Fargo &amp; Co. shares fell in the past week along with the broader market, but they're up 12% for the year. The bank is well positioned to benefit from rising U.S. interest rates, given its large base of U.S. deposits and loans. Analysts at KBW, who rate the stock outperform, recently raised its price target to $67, citing stronger-than-expected growth in net interest income. Wells Fargo closed Friday at $53.67. </p><p>   Wells Fargo is cutting costs, unlike many of its peers. The bank said in its fourth-quarter earnings announcement this month that it slashed both overall expenses and head count by 7% in 2021. </p><p>   But other banks with bigger Wall Street operations reported higher expenses, largely because they had to pay employees more after stellar investment banking and trading results. That is taking its toll on share prices. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said during its earnings remarks this month that it wouldn't meet its longer-term target returns this year and maybe next year. </p><p>   \"This issue is certain to us: front-loaded spending for less certain back-ended benefits,\" Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a research note downgrading JPMorgan shares. </p><p>   JPMorgan shares are down 8.4% so far this year, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shares are down 10%. Both banks reported record results for 2021, but investors seem focused on costs. Overall expenses rose 7% at JPMorgan and 10% at Goldman. </p><p>   Unusual price action followed even some positive results. Morgan Stanley shares rose 4.3% on Thursday, the day after it reported record 2021 results. That made it the best-performing stock that day in the S&amp;P 500, which dipped 1.1% during the session. </p><p>   It is unusual for a big bank to outperform every member of that index. That has happened just once since the start of 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Wells Fargo paced the index on July 14. </p><p></p>",
