  "title": "Deal Making Pumps Up Profit  At Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan  ----  By David Benoit and Peter Rudegeair",
  "text": "<p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reported big second-quarter profit gains on Tuesday, fueled by fees from advising companies on mergers and underwriting IPOs and other stock sales. </p><p>   This spring's rapid U.S. economic recovery, helped by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and extensive business reopening and hiring, energized American companies and the two firms' investment bankers. Corporate chieftains, buyout firms and blank-check companies put hundreds of billions of dollars to work in big-ticket acquisitions. Investors gobbled up billions of dollars of stock sold by startups in marquee initial public offerings and private fundraising rounds. </p><p>   The busy investment bankers helped offset a slowdown in trading revenue for the banks. They had posted record periods a year earlier, when uncertainty surrounding the pandemic made markets more erratic. </p><p>   Goldman and JPMorgan are the first big U.S. banks to report second-quarter results. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. are scheduled to report on Wednesday, followed by Morgan Stanley on Thursday. </p><p>   Trading is expected to be down across the board. And while bank executives are more optimistic about the U.S. economy, many firms had been holding on to heightened levels of reserves, reflecting a concern that more consumers could find themselves in trouble as pandemic-aid programs wear off. </p><p>   Goldman reported quarterly profit of $5.49 billion on revenue of $15.39 billion. Both measures were up significantly from a year ago and better than the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet. </p><p>   JPMorgan posted profit of $11.95 billion, on revenue of $30.48 billion, also beating expectations. While its profit more than doubled, its revenue fell 8%, a result of depressed lending margins and the lower trading activity. </p><p>   Some of the overall profit gains were due to the extraordinary circumstances of the second quarter of 2020. Goldman's year-ago earnings were decimated by a settlement with the government of Malaysia over dealings with a corrupt investment fund. JPMorgan's year-ago earnings plunged after it set aside billions of dollars to prepare for a painful recession. On Tuesday, it released some of the money it had socked away, with Chief Executive James Dimon declaring that the U.S. consumer is confident and \"raring to go.\" </p><p>   Companies are, too. Global deal volume hit $1.42 trillion in the quarter and was near $3 trillion in the first half, a record pace, according to Dealogic. Bond offerings and equity offerings have slowed slightly but remain higher than normal. </p><p>   Investment-banking fees were the highest on record at JPMorgan and the second-highest on record at Goldman, trailing only the first quarter. More deals are on the way: Goldman said its backlog of investment-banking transactions ended the quarter at a record level. </p><p>   \"Obviously if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn't seem likely,\" Goldman CEO David Solomon said on a conference call with analysts. </p><p>   Still, some investors see warning signs flashing. New Covid-19 variants could stall a global recovery. The pandemic has spurred supply-chain bottlenecks that are snarling parts of the economy, such as auto dealers that can't procure enough cars. Lots of laid-off workers can't find jobs that fit their skills or needs in the post-Covid world, and lots of companies can't find workers. </p><p>   Some analysts have said that the bond market has been signaling more caution about the economic recovery than the stock market. Last week, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which often climbs when investors expect growth and falls when they are more nervous, hit its lowest level since February. </p><p>   The Biden administration's efforts to rein in big business could also chill deal making. Mr. Solomon said in the current environment he expected it would be marginally harder for large tech companies to consolidate but thought that, so far, \"companies' desire to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay.\" </p><p>   JPMorgan and Goldman advised on many of the quarter's largest deals, including AT&amp;T Inc.'s combination of its WarnerMedia division with Discovery Inc. and Medline Industries Inc.'s sale to a group of private-equity firms. Goldman has been the lead underwriter on more than 160 IPOs in 2021, more than it led in all of 2020. Goldman and JPMorgan rank first and second in global deal advisory this year, according to Dealogic. Goldman holds the top spot in equity underwriting, while JPMorgan holds it for debt underwriting. </p><p>   Compensation expenses were up at both banks, and Mr. Dimon said that would continue. \"We're going to do competitive comp no matter what it takes,\" he said. </p><p>   Goldman's investment bankers brought in $3.61 billion in fees in the second quarter, up 36% from last year's second quarter. At JPMorgan, investment-banking fees rose 25% to $3.57 billion. Both banks brought in more fees from underwriting stock and advising companies on deals. Bond underwriting rose at JPMorgan but fell at Goldman. </p><p>   Goldman and JPMorgan's trading arms brought in less revenue than a year ago. Goldman reported a 32% drop in trading revenue to $4.9 billion. JPMorgan's trading revenue fell 30% to $6.79 billion. Both were still high compared with pre-pandemic levels, though. </p><p></p>",
