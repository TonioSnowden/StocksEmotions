  "text": "<p>Preparations for potential bad loans in a recession pushed Citigroup Inc.'s second quarter profit down 27%, offsetting a boom in business from global companies trying to position themselves for rising interest rates.</p><p>Results from the nation's big banks are showing that consumers and businesses remained healthy in the second quarter. But the banks are also flashing concern about the future of the economy given heightened uncertainty.</p><p>For Citigroup, which has more of a global presence than other banks, turmoil in markets, currencies and interest rates boosted its trading business and units that help big companies manage and move money around the world. Revenue jumped 11% to $19.64 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast for $18.4 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Citigroup's profit fell to $4.55 billion, or $2.19 per share, but beat the $1.68 per share expected by analysts.</p><p>Citigroup is the only big U.S. bank so far this quarter to beat analysts' expectations. Shares jumped 14% on Friday, after a broad selloff Thursday.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co., which also reported on Friday, was up 7%.</p><p>U.S. stocks have fallen sharply this year on concerns about a global slowdown, which has hurt bank shares in particular. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates aggressively to try to combat inflation, but many investors worry that will tip the economy into recession.</p><p>The economy is sending divergent signals about its health. Consumers and businesses remain financially strong, for the most part. But bank executives across the industry have said this week that there remains more uncertainty than normal about where the economy is headed.</p><p>\"While sentiment has shifted, little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession,\" Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser said, pointing to consumer balance sheets, strong hiring markets and corporate demand. \"So while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be as sharp a downturn as others in recent memory.\"</p><p>Ms. Fraser said the evidence is different in Europe. \"We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply,\" she said. \"And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon.\"</p><p>The bank set aside an extra $375 million in new funds for potential future loan losses, which hurt earnings. A year ago, with the global economy emerging from a pandemic slump, Citigroup released $2.4 billion from its reserves.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which reported Thursday, also said it was setting aside new funds for potential bad loans.</p><p>Citigroup said it was pausing its stock repurchases partly because of the uncertainty. Last month's Fed stress tests gave the biggest U.S. banks a clean bill of health, but many will be required to hold more capital in the coming months. \"We want to get to a more stable environment and get to those capital levels,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said of the buyback halt.</p><p>Wells Fargo's profit fell 48%, weighed down by a decline in the value of its equity investments and a drop in mortgage originations. Mortgage originations fell 36%, crimped by higher interest rates.</p><p>\"Consumers and businesses have been resilient so far,\" CEO Charlie Scharf said on a call with analysts.</p><p>Higher interest rates are also typically a boon to banks' lending operations, since firms can charge more on loans. Lending profitability and core loans were up at both banks. Wells Fargo said it expects net interest income to increase about 20% in 2022 compared with 2021.</p><p>At Citigroup, which has a far bigger Wall Street presence than Wells Fargo, market volatility was good for traders and good for the unit that helps big companies navigate the global economy.</p><p>Revenue rose 28% in its businesses managing corporate securities and treasury and trade operations. The treasury business had its best quarter in a decade, executives said.</p><p>Big international companies navigating volatile currency markets bolstered their deposits at Citigroup and increased trading and hedging with the bank. Some big U.S. companies have recently said that the strong dollar will hurt their earnings.</p><p>Trading revenue rose 25% at Citigroup. It was up 15% at JPMorgan and 21% at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>The market's gyrations haven't been so good for investment bankers, who advise companies on engineering mergers and going public. Citigroup's investment banking revenue fell 46% as big companies confronted their own uncertain outlooks. Investment banking fees dropped 54% at JPMorgan and 55% at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Consumers continued spending and borrowing in the quarter. Consumer spending on Citi-issued credit cards rose 16% in the quarter and balances increased. Spending on commercial credit cards was up 61%.</p><p>Citigroup continued slashing its exposure to Russia, where it had more business than other big rivals. The bank said it might lose as much as $2 billion on its Russia exposure in the worst-case scenario, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion it had warned was possible in April.</p><p>The bank said it is now considering \"a full range of possibilities\" on how to exit its Russia consumer and commercial banking business. The bank has been trying to sell those operations and had previously said it was in \"active dialogue\" on the sales.</p><p>Citi also said it had set aside funds in preparation for a potential legal settlement with U.S. regulators over allegations employees have improperly used personal phones and messaging services like WhatsApp. Morgan Stanley said Thursday it had set aside $200 million for a similar inquiry. JPMorgan paid $200 million in a settlement last year.</p><p>Bank Earnings Center</p><p>More coverage and analysis on the latest financial results from Wall Street</p><p>* JPMorgan Sees Economic Trouble Brewing</p><p>* Morgan Stanley Profit Hit by Deal Making Drop</p><p>* Wells Fargo Revenue Falls Short of Expectations</p><p>* BlackRock's Assets Decline Amid Market Downturn</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Defensive Bank Moves Aren't Whole Story</p><p>* Heard on the Street; Citi Shows Upside in Deposit Downdraft</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup's Profit Falls As It Preps For Potential Loan Losses</p>",
