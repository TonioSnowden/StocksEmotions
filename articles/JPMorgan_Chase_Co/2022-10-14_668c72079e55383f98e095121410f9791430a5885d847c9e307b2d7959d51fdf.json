  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley kicked off the third-quarter earnings season for Wall Street banks on Friday. The headline numbers made for worrying reading. A collapse in investment banking revenue and a ramp-up in loan loss reserve — the rainy day fund that banks set aside to cover potential loan losses — took a bite out of net income.</p> <p>It was not all doom and gloom. Despite higher inflation and recession fears, the US consumer is still doing alright. Handling money for the masses remains a bright spot for America's biggest banks. </p> <p>At JPMorgan, Citi and Wells, credit card purchases grew 18 per cent, on average, and card loan balances rose 17 per cent. Net interest income at JPMorgan and Wells jumped by more than a third and by 18 per cent at Citi, amid the revival in loan demand and higher interest rates. </p> <p>The performances of retail banking operations were in sharp contrast to wholesale finance divisions. As expected, a slump in dealmaking and IPOs hit investment banking revenues. They fell more than 40 per cent at JPMorgan and Citi. The decline was 55 per cent at Morgan Stanley. A strong quarter for fixed income was undercut by weakness in equity trading.</p> <p>Higher rates mean Main Street beats Wall Street. Shares in JPMorgan, Citi and Wells all rose on Friday while those for Morgan Stanley fell. But there are drawbacks. For one thing, the sharp rise in mortgage rates has put a lid on banks' home-lending businesses. </p> <p>During the pandemic, some banks shifted more of their cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve into Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities. This provided banks with more yield at a time of low interest rates and sluggish loan growth. </p> <p>Now, higher rates mean they have to mark down the value of these holdings. That in turn will limit their ability to lend more money to consumers and return capital to shareholders. JPMorgan, for example, recorded $959mn in “net investment securities losses” during the quarter.</p> <p>The macro-environment remains a wild card. A bet on banks is now a proxy for whether the US will enter into a recession or not.</p><p>Source:  2022 'US banks: Main Street does heavy lifting amid IPO drought' FT.com 14 October.
