  "text": "<p>In any case, find me at @mdecambre.</p><p>Quote(s) of the week</p><p>SBF</p><p>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested this week by Bahamas authorities on eight criminal charges stemming from allegations that he deceived customers and investors of the crypto platform he started in 2019.</p><p>The New York Post reported that he vowed to fight extradition from Nassau. The paper reported that the disgraced crypto founder faces a maximum 115 years in prison if convicted of all felony charges.</p><p>Meanwhile, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams cited additional charges, including that SBF and others \"lied to Alameda's investors about the source of the money that he was using to pay those debts.\"</p><p>The implication that there are conspirators was also noted by Williams: \"To anyone who participated in wrongdoing at FTX or Alameda Research and who has not yet come forward, I would strongly encourage you to come see us before we come to you,\" he said.</p><p>Williams also said allegations include that SBF and other co-conspirators stole billions from FTX customers and used it for \"his personal benefit, including to make personal investments and to cover expenses and debts of his hedge fund, Alameda Research.\"</p><p>Conspirators?</p><p>Beyond Bankman-Fried, attention is also focused on the whereabouts of Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, the hedge fund closely affiliated with FTX, writes MarketWatch's James Rogers.</p><p>On Tuesday the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF, with committing fraud after raising $1.8 billion from investors.</p><p>The links between FTX and Alameda Research are coming under intense scrutiny. The cryptocurrency exchange used customer money to lend billions of dollars to Alameda for risky trades and investments, The Wall Street Journal reports. Citing FTX bankruptcy filings, The Wall Street Journal also reports that Bankman-Fried owned 90% of Alameda Research.</p><p>Read the rest of this story here.</p><p>Bitcoin a buy?</p><p>The outlook for bitcoin is murky. Trustless protocols like the blockchain that underpins bitcoin had initially been swept up in the tilt lower in the aftermath of FTX's bankruptcy early last month. But the world's No. 1 crypto is riding higher than it was before FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 though it is decidedly lower than it was before problems started to emerge at FTX in early November:</p><p>And while many crypto proponents see the downfall of FTX as an indictment of the individual and not the trustless, decentralized platform that bitcoin was intended to be, the Guardian's Nils Pratley makes the case that \"FTX looks an existential event for the crypto trading fad.\"</p><p>He says alternative coins haven't garnered much traction as a means of exchange but, instead, have been used for elicit purposes.</p><p>\"As mediums of exchange in the real world of goods and services, none of the digital tokens has achieved liftoff, aside from their use in \"terrorism financing, tax avoidance and sex trafficking,\" as JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon put it on CNBC last week.</p><p>Goldman commodity analysts speculate that gold GC00 GOLD will outperform bitcoin in the longer term because adoption of the crypto will need to be driven by the development of \"real uses rather than speculative interest.\"</p><p>\"The development of real use cases is also crucial to reducing bitcoin's volatility, but is by no means guaranteed and may take a long time to play out,\" analysts Mikhail Sprogis and Jeffrey Currie wrote.</p><p>Gold prices stand at around $1,800/oz. and have benefited from an environment of higher inflation, though that climb has been mitigated by higher interest rates, with bonds competing against gold as a haven.</p><p>The strength of the dollar, which has deteriorated somewhat, has also contributed to weakness in gold. which tends to be priced in dollars DXY.</p><p>It is unclear, what the future holds for bitcoin, or Ether, but it seems that there will be significant challenges for bitcoin to return anywhere near its historic peak at around $65,000 seen in November 2021.</p><p>That said, the outlook for the S&amp;P 500 SPX, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP is hazy against the current economic backdrop, with a possible recession looming.</p><p>Crypto in a snap</p><p>Bitcoin has gained 3.4% during the past week, and was trading at around $17,397 on Thursday midday, according to FactSet.</p><p>Ether was up 3.54% over the same stretch to around $1,271.</p><p>Meanwhile, FTX native coins, known as FTT tokens, were down around 3% over the past seven days, trading at $1.36,according to data provider CoinGecko.</p><p>Notably, Binance's native token, known as Binance USD, or BUSD, was flat over a seven-day period, Binance is the largest crypto exchange on the planet and its stablecoin has a circulating supply of around 19 billion BUSD and a total supply of 18.6 billion, according to CoinGecko. </p><p> Biggest Gainers  Price        7-day return%  OKC              $27.06       55.2  Toncoin          $2.37        30.8  Bitcoin SV       $47.13       16  XDC Network      $0.02377977  15.5  Lido DAO         $1.14        13.5</p><p>Source: CoinGecko as of Dec. 15</p><p> Biggest Losers  Price        7-day return%  Flow            $0.904276    -13.6   Chain          $0.03320061  -13.5  Trust Wallet    $2.13        -13.2  BTSE Token      $2.27        -12.4  Axie Infinity   $7.57        -10.9</p><p>Crypto companies, funds</p><p>Shares of Coinbase Global Inc.
