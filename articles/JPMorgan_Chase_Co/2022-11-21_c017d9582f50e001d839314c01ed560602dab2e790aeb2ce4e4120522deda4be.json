  "text": "<p>Many investors credit the robust U.S. labor market and resilient consumer spending for helping American stocks retain their luster in the face of a darkening global economy. Skittish investors heading for the safety of the dollar have further boosted their allure.</p><p>\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the problem is most of the beholders are American,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>Europe is still in the midst of an energy crisis sparked by Russia's war in Ukraine. Shifting fiscal policies have roiled the U.K.'s bond market—and pensions funds. China continues to grapple with the impact of its stringent zero-Covid policy. And Japan has been forced to intervene in currency markets to support a rapidly weakening yen.</p><p>Where investors call home has been one of the biggest drivers of their performance of late.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 17% in 2022, trailing other major indexes on a local currency basis. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off 11%, Japan's Nikkei 225 is down 3.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 is flat.</p><p>On a dollar basis, that picture changes. Funds geared toward international stocks without hedging their currency risk have been battered by the dollar's surge. The MSCI Japan ETF has fallen 19%, while a similar exchange-traded fund tied to U.K. stocks has fallen 8.7%.</p><p>Even with the S&amp;P 500 poised for its worst year since 2008, the buy-the-dip mentality that drove U.S. stocks to repeated records in recent years lives on, says Jim Masturzo, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at Research Affiliates.</p><p>\"For the last decade, the U.S. market was ripping every year. Why would people invest anywhere else?\" he said.</p><p>Investors are quick to swoop into the stock market en masse on any sign that inflation appears to be cooling, betting that the Federal Reserve will soon slow its pace of interest-rates increases.</p><p>For example, after data showed inflation slightly eased in October, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 5.5% to its best one-day gain since April 2020. The Nasdaq Composite surged 7.4%, one of the 20 best days for the tech-heavy index in its more than five-decade history.</p><p>Although Fed officials were quick to assert the central bank's commitment to further tightening, stocks jumped again on last week's data showing waning producer-price pressures.</p><p>Of the more than $14 trillion sitting in equity mutual and exchange-traded funds domiciled in the U.S., roughly 78% is in U.S. stock funds, according to Morningstar Direct. The bias is even stronger this year: Of the $93 billion that investors have added to U.S. or international equity funds, more than 90% has gone to those holding U.S. stocks.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. accounts for roughly 62% of the global stock market capitalization, based on weightings in the MSCI Country All World index.</p><p>Since bottoming in March 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis, the S&amp;P 500 has surged 486%, outpacing Japan's Nikkei 225, which has risen 294%; the Stoxx Europe 600, which has gained 174%; and the U.K.'s FTSE 100, up 108%.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you invest in international stocks? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>U.S. stocks' sustained stretch of outperformance is a historical outlier. Since 1975, U.S. stocks typically outperform international markets for just under eight years before their advantage dissipates, according to research by Hartford Funds.</p><p>\"Many people think the U.S. is the only game in town, but over history, that isn't true,\" said Meb Faber, co-founder and chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management. Mr. Faber expects U.S. stocks \"to go sideways over the next decade\" when accounting for inflation.</p><p>Of course, many investors argue there is a compelling case for investing overseas. Chief among their reasons: attractive valuations, high dividend yields and bets that the dollar is due for a fall after its dramatic run.</p><p>Despite this year's slump, U.S. stocks are nearly 1.8 times as expensive as the other 22 developed markets in aggregate, when comparing prices with corporate earnings over the past five years. That is just below the high-water mark set about a year ago, according to Leuthold Group data going back to the 1970s, and well above the ratio's historical average, which is nearly even.</p><p>By another metric, the American stock market is currently costlier than it has been more than 90% of the time since 1881. That is according to Research Affiliates' analysis of price levels relative to inflation-adjusted corporate earnings over the past 10 years.</p><p>Shiller CAPE ratios show the MSCI Europe trading at 16.4 times inflation-adjusted average corporate earnings over the past 10 years, a steep discount to the S&amp;P 500's 28.4 ratio. The MSCI Emerging Markets index is trading at 11.9 times earnings.</p><p>U.S. dividend yields, meanwhile, haven't been lower relative to foreign markets in at least two decades. Payouts from stocks in the MSCI World ex-U.S. index—which includes 22 developed markets—yield an extra 1.9 percentage points compared with the S&amp;P 500 over the next year, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management analysis.</p><p>And foreign stocks should receive further support when the dollar reverts to more typical levels. The sharp rise in the greenback has punished foreign currencies—and equity markets. The WSJ Dollar Index is up more than 11% in 2022, propelled by the Fed's policy tightening and a flight to safety among global investors.</p><p>Mr. Kelly and Mr. Masturzo both said they see that combination of factors leading to double-digit annualized returns in Europe over the next decade.</p><p>\"You want to buy when there is blood in the streets,\" said Mr. Masturzo. \"That makes now a good time for Europe.\"</p><p>Write to Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Remains 'Only Game in Town' for Stock Investors</p>",
