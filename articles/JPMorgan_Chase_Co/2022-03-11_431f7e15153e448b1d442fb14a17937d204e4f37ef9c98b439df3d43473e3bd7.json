  "text": "<p>Back patting usually starts once the task is complete. Deutsche Bank's management team does things differently. Healthy pay rises went to most of the team last year, the group's annual report revealed on Friday. Chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8da4356a-d5e7-4be2-80a1-5c45997cf609\">Christian Sewing</a>'s €8.8mn package jumped almost 20 per cent. Deutsche's ambitious new plan, presented this past week, shows he will work hard justifying it.</p> <p>More immediate <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/deutsche-bank-ceo-gets-20-pay-rise-2021-2022-03-11/\">concerns </a>for shareholders might involve the bank's exposure to Russia. Gross loans there are €1.4bn, or just 0.3 per cent of total. Reputational risks, though, could build as the bank refuses to pull out of Russia as announced by US peers Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. </p> <p>Curiously, Russia's actions in Ukraine may well have an effect upon Deutsche hitting its profitability targets, which depend on rising European interest rates. Sewing has promised to more than double returns on tangible equity to over 10 per cent by 2025. Deutsche expects annual revenue growth of up to 4.5 per cent over the period. About 1.5 percentage points of that relies on higher rates implied by forward curves. </p> <p>True, the European Central Bank has confirmed its intention to raise interest rates, as the energy price shock continues. A hawkish ECB might well help the continent's banks reprice their loans. The ECB does not expect a recession in its scenario analysis. Corporate chiefs demur: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-volkswagen-idINL3N2VD1GE\">Herbert Diess</a> of Volkswagen fears a downturn worse than that wreaked by the pandemic. </p> <p>Higher loan interest payments, coinciding with broader inflation, would make life particularly tough for indebted households, and companies. Deutsche bets its capital buffer can cope and that it can reduce expenses. It targets a cost to income ratio of 62.5 per cent by 2025 from the 70 per cent that is expected this year. &#xa0;</p> <p>The bank plans to return €8bn of capital to its very patient investors to 2025, providing an average yield (including buybacks) of 8 per cent. If Sewing succeeds — a big if — then his shareholders will also reap the bounty. </p><p>Source:  2022 'Deutsche Bank: more pay stretches targets ' FT.com 11 March.
