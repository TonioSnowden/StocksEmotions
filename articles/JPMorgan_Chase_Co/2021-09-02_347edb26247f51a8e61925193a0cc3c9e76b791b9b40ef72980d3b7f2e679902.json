  "text": "<p>Stocks have risen over the summer, buoyed by expectations that the economic recovery would enable corporate profits to keep expanding. Investors are broadly optimistic that shares will continue to eke out gains, and Wednesday's moves continue a calm stretch for the market. The S&amp;P 500 hasn't suffered a 5% pullback since October and has clinched more than 50 fresh highs in 2021.</p><p>\"Every time you get even a 1% or 2% pullback, that presents the opportunity to 'buy the dip'\" for investors, said Adam Phillips, a managing director at EP Wealth Advisors.</p><p>Individual investors have piled into the stock market at a record pace this summer, helping send stocks to repeated records. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists estimate net inflows to U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds rose to a record of roughly $16 billion in July before an additional $13 billion poured in during August.</p><p>However, Mr. Phillips and other money managers caution that markets are likely to become more volatile in the fall, pointing to catalysts including the curtailment of stimulus programs by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"September can be quite a challenging month for risk assets,\" said Suzanne Hutchins, head of real return investments at Newton Investment Management. \"Markets are pretty high across the board, valuations are pretty rich.\"</p><p>Other potential risks include China's crackdown on technology companies and Germany's federal election in September, Ms. Hutchins said. At the same time, \"there is a lot of liquidity that needs to find a home, which is always pretty supportive,\" she added.</p><p>A private manufacturing gauge in China fell to its lowest level in over a year, suggesting Covid-19 outbreaks led to a decline in activity in August. Investors expect the slowdown will prompt the People's Bank of China to loosen monetary policy to boost growth, said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>Fresh data released Wednesday showed that economic activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in August. An index of U.S.-based manufacturing rose to 59.9 in August from 59.5 in the prior month, according to the Institute for Supply Management. This Friday, traders will be parsing the monthly jobs report.</p><p>Concerns about the pace of economic growth have led investors to pile into shares of tech and fast-growing companies.</p><p>Shares of Netflix jumped $12.88, or 2.3%, to $582.07. Twitter and Apple shares also outperformed the broader market, gaining 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively.</p><p>Overseas markets were broadly higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.5%, led by travel, leisure and retail stocks.</p><p>Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.4% but South Korea's Kospi was down 1%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.1%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
