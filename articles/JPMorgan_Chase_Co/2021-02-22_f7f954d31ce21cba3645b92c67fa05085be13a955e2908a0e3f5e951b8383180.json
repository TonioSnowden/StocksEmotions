  "text": "<p>The failure to deliver the securities can cause both reputational harm and result in penalty recommendations from the Treasury Market Practices Group, which could be up to 3% of the face value of the securities, BNY Mellon said. TMPG is an industry trade group sponsored by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>BNY Mellon, which is one of the largest clearing and settlement firms in the roughly $20 trillion Treasury market, said that on a typical day about 2% of transactions fail to settle. BNY Mellon is involved in the clearing and settlement of about a third of U.S. Treasurys, according to research and consulting firm Aite Group. Other firms clearing and settling Treasury trades include JPMorgan Chase and State Street Corp., according to Aite.</p><p>\"It's a large market,\" said Brian Ruane, chief executive of BNY Mellon's clearance and collateral management business. \"So 2% is still a large number.\"</p><p>When the Treasury market technology service, which BNY Mellon announced earlier this month, predicts a market trade will fail to settle, it provides a warning to the client and allows them to take corrective action, such as obtaining additional securities to fulfill a trade.</p><p>The bank used 10 months of BNY Mellon settlement data to train and test the model and found it can pick up about 40% of the trades that are likely to fail. The model is new and will learn and get better as it ingests more client data, Mr. Ruane said.</p>",
