  "text": "<p>Profit halved at Barclays in the second quarter as a spike in misconduct provisions to cover the costs of a paperwork blunder offset another surge in trading revenue at its investment bank.</p> <p>Net income fell to £1.07bn from £2.05bn in the same period last year, but beat analysts' expectations for £996mn. </p> <p>However, the decline reflected £1.3bn of litigation and conduct provisions, largely due to a further hit from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b455325-de41-47c8-92e3-a1ed333345a6\">a trading error</a> in the US that caused Barclays to sell $17.6bn more exchange-traded notes than it was allowed.</p> <p>In addition to having to buy back the notes from customers at a steep cost, the bank set aside an initial £165mn to cover a likely penalty from the US Securities and Exchange Commission related to the matter. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d3d4ba02-485f-467a-87f5-52536f70a57c\">Barclays</a> also became the latest bank to take a $200mn provision for US regulatory probes into staff misusing their personal devices — via apps such as WhatsApp — for work communications. Rivals including Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan have also taken similar reserves.</p> <p>Despite the charges, Barclays said it would pay a dividend of 2.25p a share and buy back another £500mn of its stock, taking the total it has pledged to repurchase this year to £1.5bn. </p> <p>Overall, group revenue rose 23 per cent to £6.7bn, compared with the average £6.5bn analyst estimate, driven by another buoyant performance in its trading unit.</p> <p>A 71 per cent rise in revenue from fixed-income trading to £1.5bn offset a steep 16 per cent decline in equities, the latter underperforming most peers. There was also a 37 per cent plunge in income from the capital markets and advisory business, as debt and equity issuance collapsed.</p> <p>“The magnitude of the fixed-income strength and equities weakness is somewhat surprising,” said Citigroup analyst Andrew Coombs. “As always with an investment banking-led revenue beat, the debate will be to what extent the market extrapolates this to 2023 and beyond.”</p> <p>Barclays also took a £47mn loss in its corporate lending book. As a result, overall pre-tax profit at the investment bank almost halved to £784mn.</p> <p>While it was another messy quarter marked by misconduct, the underlying results provide some cause for optimism for chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan, whose tenure so far has been turbulent since replacing Jes Staley in November.</p> <p>Staley resigned amid a probe into his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Staley is awaiting the results of an appeal with the Financial Conduct Authority and has vowed to challenge the findings.</p> <p>Barclays stock fell 3 per cent after the release, extending its decline to 22 per cent this year.</p> <p>Although credit impairment charges swung to £200mn from a release of £797mn in the same period last year, the lender reported little in the way of customer distress. </p> <p>Finance director Anna Cross said that despite the “severe pressure” that inflation was putting on people in the UK and US, “customers are acting in a very rational way” by repaying their credit card balances swiftly and remortgaging their homes to lock in low costs before interest rates increase further.</p> <p>The bank expects its net interest margin — a measure of the difference between what a bank pays for deposits and charges for loans — to reach 280-290 basis points this year, from a projected 262 basis points in the first quarter.</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris in London 2022 'Barclays' profit halves after misconduct provisions wipe out trading gains' FT.com 28 July.
