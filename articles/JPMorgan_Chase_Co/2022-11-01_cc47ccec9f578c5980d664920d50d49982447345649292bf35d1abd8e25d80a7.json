  "title": "Government Climate Funding Pushes Private Sector to Make Good on Promises; Billions in federal funding for battery metals, hydrogen and carbon capture is designed to unlock more private-sector investment",
  "text": "<p>The Biden administration is starting to dole out billions of dollars for nascent climate industries such as battery metals. That is putting pressure on banks and investors to step up with additional funds to make good on their climate promises.</p><p>This cash is coming from last year's bipartisan infrastructure bill. The federal government granted about 20 producers of raw materials that power rechargeable batteries a total of nearly $3 billion. The goal is to kick-start a domestic supply chain for big auto makers and combat China's dominance of battery materials.</p><p>There is a lot more money where that came from. Additional infrastructure-bill funding is expected to go to upstarts and established companies in areas such as clean hydrogen, carbon capture and electric-vehicle charging in the months ahead. Financing could also come through the Inflation Reduction Act, the Energy Department's loan program and from a separate investment fund known as a green bank.</p><p>The flood of money and similar funding from governments in Europe and Asia has been structured to incentivize private investment and lending by reducing some of the risk of these young companies.</p><p>It is still too soon to tell if banks, businesses and investors will seize those incentives. Many have made promises to boost green investments, including ahead of last year's United Nations climate conference in Glasgow.</p><p>Some of the government support that many asked for at the time to reduce the risk of these investments has appeared. Still, the growth in green financing has slowed this year, though market volatility and the war in Ukraine take some of the blame.</p><p>\"The traditional arguments are no longer acceptable,\" said Mindy Lubber, CEO of sustainability nonprofit Ceres. \"We are all running out of excuses and running out of time.\"</p><p>Companies are on track to raise about $1 trillion in green and sustainability-linked bonds this year, down from a record of roughly $1.3 trillion last year, Dealogic data show. The ratio of fossil-fuel to green debt financing has stayed steady recently.</p><p>Equity financing for climate startups in private markets is also below 2021's record but still well ahead of figures from 2019 and 2020, according to PitchBook.</p><p>Most of the recent federal-grant funding is for startups such as Piedmont Lithium Inc.that are years awayfrom supplying auto makers with large amounts of material. Existing producer Albemarle Corp. was one of the few established companies to receive funding.</p><p>This year's U.N. climate conference begins Sunday in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El Sheikh. For the big alliance of banks and investors launched last year, the lead-up to the conference has been marked not by new promises but by infighting and miscommunication.</p><p>Banks say that as highly regulated financial intermediaries, they are limited in what they can do to increase green financing. Even with government support and tax credits, many climate startups don't meet their lending criteria and will struggle to turn a profit for many years. Backlash from Republican politicians against climate investing practices is also pressuring Wall Street.</p><p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. have balked at what they thought were efforts by a key U.N. body to reduce their financing of fossil-fuel producers and audit their climate progress. Some regret joining the coalition, known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. The alliance in recent weeks has taken steps to reassure the upset banks that the U.N. can't set binding climate criteria without their input.</p><p>The infighting mimics what has occurred in the world this year. The energy crisis caused by the Ukraine war has made clear how difficult and volatile the transition from fossil fuels will be. Banks have been caught in the middle, defending their funding for fossil fuels as necessary while remaining under pressure to fund clean energy.</p><p>\"People are now doing their homework and realizing how hard it is,\" said Aniket Shah, global head of environmental, social and governance—or ESG—strategy at Jefferies Financial Group Inc.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What clean energy do you hope to see receive more financial support from both the government and Wall Street?
