  "text": "<p>Ukraine has secured preliminary agreement from government creditors and bondholders to suspend debt repayments from August 1 until at least the end of 2023, as it struggles to plug a budget deficit running at $5bn a month.</p> <p>Bilateral lenders including Germany, the UK and the US on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/2022/07/20/group-of-creditors-of-ukraine-statement\">said payments would be suspended</a> from next month and they would “strongly encourage” private bondholders to do the same.</p> <p>Simultaneously, Ukraine's government <a href=\"https://mof.gov.ua/en/news/ukraine_announces_liability_management_transactions_on_its_eurobonds_and_gdp-linked_securities-3531\">said it would invite</a> holders of the country's eurobonds and other debt instruments to agree to similar terms. It said it had already received “explicit indications of support” from a group of institutional investors including BlackRock, Fidelity International, Amia Capital, Gemsstock and others.</p> <p>The official creditors said suspending payments would provide “substantive support for the government and people of Ukraine” as the country “defends itself against Russia's unjustified, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The group of creditors includes Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US. They said the suspension of repayments would last until the end of 2023 “with the possibility of an additional year”. A spokesperson declined to say what value of repayments would be suspended.</p> <p>JPMorgan said Kyiv had asked it to seek consent from private investors to suspend repayments of capital and interest on eurobonds and GDP-linked warrants. Analysts at Dragon Capital in Kyiv said the suspension of such payments over two years would deliver savings to the government of about $6bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>“This is a positive announcement from Kyiv,” said Simon Quijano-Evans of Gemcorp Capital Management. “It puts the ball on the side of the bondholders and engages them in the process. Bondholders have made it very clear to the government that the government should decide what is best and bondholders will follow.”</p> <p>Ukraine's bilateral and commercial creditors will be paid interest on the amounts deferred during the repayment suspension.</p> <p>For bond markets, any suspension, even if voluntary, is almost certain to constitute a default and be recognised as such by credit rating agencies. But an official at the French treasury said that for bilateral creditors, the deferral was a form of debt management that “is not a default at all”. Ukraine would make its payments in full, even if with a delay.</p> <p>The two sets of creditors would deliver the same kind of support through the two arrangements, the official added. “The idea is the same and the deferral is quite similar. We are sending a message of support to Ukraine.”</p> <p>The move marks a U-turn for Kyiv. Since Russia's full-scale invasion began on February 24 it has insisted on meeting its obligations in full to maintain the confidence of international investors and market access, despite pressure from some official creditors to delay payments.</p> <p>The IMF said last week that it expected Kyiv to keep servicing its debts and called on donor nations to come forward with more support, preferably in the form of grants rather than loans. </p> <p>Ukraine has paid some $1bn in redemptions and interest to external creditors since February, while appealing to its allies for financial assistance.</p> <p>The statement by the creditor nations said: “In these exceptional circumstances, and acknowledging Ukraine's exemplary track record of honouring debt service to date, the members of the group of creditors of Ukraine support this consent solicitation and strongly encourage bondholders to consent to Ukraine's request”.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mark Raczkiewycz in Kyiv</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Wheatley in São Paulo and Guy Chazan in Berlin 2022 'Ukraine secures preliminary deal to suspend debt repayments' FT.com 20 July.
