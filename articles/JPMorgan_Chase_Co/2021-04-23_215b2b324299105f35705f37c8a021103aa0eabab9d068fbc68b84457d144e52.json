  "title": "'Super  League'  Flopped in  48 Hours  ----  By Joshua Robinson",
  "text": "<p>   An alliance of the world's most powerful soccer clubs had secretly plotted for three years before they launched an audacious power play to create a European \"Super League\" this week. They came together out of frustration over a system they felt was ancient, broken, and above all, failing to pay giants like Manchester City, Real Madrid and Juventus their due. </p><p>   Yet when the Super League launched last weekend, it was nonetheless a scramble. The rebel clubs were sorting out legal details and had only just secured a firm commitment from JP Morgan for a $4 billion line of credit. Two of the 12 teams signed on at the last minute. </p><p>   One adviser warned: \"This is going to be spectacularly difficult. Are you sure you want to do this now?\" according to a person familiar with the project. They plowed ahead, convinced the strength of the most celebrated brands in the world's most popular sport would ensure the Super League became a reality. </p><p>   The 12 clubs were lashing together their futures for the next 23 years. The Super League lasted barely two days. By Tuesday night, the project was in tatters after an uproar that swept up fans and rival clubs. The teams failed to anticipate political pushback from U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others. </p><p>   What remained was a jarring realization: The biggest brands in world soccer weren't nearly as powerful as they thought. </p><p>   The Super League clubs were left to deal with the humiliation of a stunning own goal that caused fans to accuse them of being greedy billionaires. But they made their doomed play because, despite their popularity, their valuable businesses are rarely stable. </p><p>   Operating in the Wild West that is the European game, they live in a world without salary caps or player trades. Huge sums come in from global broadcast rights, but they spend money to swipe talent from each other in an endless game of financial brinkmanship. </p><p>   They launched their plan despite having laid almost no groundwork. The Super League had no broadcast partner and little concrete data on what its market would look like, according to several people familiar with the plan. When the news exploded into the open on Sunday, they were caught without a strategy for countering backlash. </p><p>   The Super League clubs were aiming to head off changes by UEFA, the sport's European governing body, to the continentwide Champions League tournament. The Champions League rakes inmore than $3 billion a year in television and commercial payments and aired in nearly 200 countries around the world. It brings together the top teams not just from England, Germany and other powers, but also sides like Danish champion Midtjylland. In theory at least, any team can qualify on merit and win. </p><p>   The Super League clubs deemed the Champions League to be a subpar product with too many dud games, too few marquee matchups -- and not enough guaranteed payouts. </p><p>   \"There are games that nobody watches. The truth is I struggle to watch them. In Spain, in England, in Italy,\" Real Madrid President Florentino Perez said on Spanish radio Wednesday. \"Somebody has to give us another format, to earn more money. As without earning more money, this will all die.\" </p><p>   He was exaggerating only a little. Teams like his run up huge debt. Barcelona revealed it was more than $1 billion in the red last year. Real Madrid owes upward of $400 million, according to recent filings. Italian teams are feeling the pain. </p><p>   Which is why two of the three key architects of the project happened to be Mr. Perez and Juventus President Andrea Agnelli, scion to the Agnelli fortune. The third was Manchester United's vice chairman, Ed Woodward, who made public his resignation from the club on Tuesday in the aftermath of the Super League's demise. They worked closely with a financial firm in Madrid called Key Capital Partners, which had a long relationship with Mr. Perez's construction company. </p><p>   As Mr. Perez presented it on internal calls leading up to the announcement, the situation was urgent. \"These clubs are going to lose millions of euros, and they cannot [afford to] do that,\" he said in Spanish. \"Apart from those in England.\" </p><p>   Those in England were in a slightly different situation. Over the past 25 years, they have ridden one of the most powerful financial waves in sports. By founding the Premier League in 1992, they designed a product specifically for television, buoyed by lavish contracts with broadcasters around the world. </p><p>   In doing so, English soccer opened up a decisive advantage over the European leagues. The league's longtime \"Big Four\" -- Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea -- could count on earning tens of millions more by qualifying for the Champions League each year. </p><p>   Then the Premier League's Big Four swelled to a Big Six in the mid-2010s with the rise of Manchester City and Tottenham. Suddenly, it had six teams vying for four Champions League spots. </p><p>   By last Friday, the Super League had 12 teams ready to go, though signs of trouble were appearing. Three big European clubs -- Germany's Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund and France's Paris Saint-Germain -- rebuffed entreaties to join. \"The feeling in the group was that 12 was enough to launch,\" a person close to the project said. </p><p>   The last two clubs to join the Super League weren't as committed to the project as the others. Their owners were never really in it for the money. Chelsea, owned by the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, has run the club at a loss for years in order to accumulate trophies. And Manchester City was acquired by a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi in 2008 as part of a larger revamp of the emirate's image. </p><p>   Their weaker commitment to the project became a problem on Sunday when the public immediately rejected the idea and politicians seized on the issue. In an appearance before Premier League representatives on Tuesday, the U.K.'s Mr. Johnson vowed to drop a \"legislative bomb\" on the effort that threatened to reclassify soccer clubs as protected institutions. </p><p>   The Super League members were prepared to stomach abuse -- from fans, from rival clubs, from UEFA. They were even prepared for legal challenges. Except they never saw Mr. Johnson's cameo coming, people familiar said. </p><p>   That evening, as Chelsea prepared to play at home, word circulated that the club was drawing up papers to withdraw from the project. Man City was close behind, announcing its exit. Just after midnight in Madrid, the rest of the six Premier League clubs confirmed their intent to do the same. </p><p>   By the next morning, Liverpool co-owner John W. Henry was apologizing to fans. \"I alone am responsible for the unnecessary negativity brought forward over the past couple of days,\" he said in a video. \"That's something I won't forget.\" </p><p></p>",
