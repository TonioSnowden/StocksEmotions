  "text": "<p>Global stocks held on to their recent gains on Wednesday, inching closer towards record highs after a strong rally in the previous session.</p> <p>Wall Street's blue-chip S&amp;P 500 share index rose 0.3 per cent, wiping out almost all the losses suffered after the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant and ending the day just 0.1 per cent shy of its all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent.</p> <p>Equity markets have whipsawed in the past fortnight as investors have worried about the potential effect of Omicron and the Federal Reserve signalling its willingness to speed up its tightening of monetary policy.</p> <p>However, global markets staged their<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0ebc4a7-c8b6-4564-a4b6-ca537e0cd615\"> biggest one-day gain </a>for more than a year on Tuesday after early data from South Africa suggested Omicron may be less likely to result in serious illness than other strains.</p> <p>Pfizer, one of the developers of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccines, added on Wednesday that early studies showed a third shot of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b65c385-4147-492a-a946-30f98e59d8b0\">offered protection</a> against Omicron, but two doses show significantly reduced effectiveness.</p> <p>The FTSE All-World index rose a further 0.4 per cent on Wednesday, but European stocks were an exception to the positive picture. The continent-wide Stoxx 600 index closed down 0.6 per cent, dragged lower by technology and consumer cyclical stocks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2c6706f-a7ca-4a3d-81a2-bba84e11127f\">Sterling touched a year-low against the dollar</a> of $1.316 ahead of Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a40843cf-5e6c-4237-b92c-a8f22e888325\">announcing</a> new coronavirus-related curbs. The Bank of England has a rate-setting meeting next week. </p> <p>“We still have a high degree of uncertainty about the pandemic,” cautioned Juliette Cohen, strategist at CPR Asset Management, adding that thin trading conditions during the holiday season meant market moves “are going to be more amplified than they should be”.</p> <p>In government debt markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose 0.05 percentage points to 1.52 per cent. Bond yields rise when prices fall.</p> <p>Jay Powell, Fed chair, last week indicated his support for a quicker reduction of the central bank's $120bn-a-month bond purchases that have boosted markets since March 2020. </p> <p>Leading economists expect the Fed will end its asset purchases by March, setting the stage for rate rises soon after, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94636129-58f1-4972-ac1c-6283ff8ff447\">according to a survey</a> for the Financial Times by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business's Initiative on Global Markets. </p> <p>“Markets are currently positive but there's a potential narrative shift we need to be careful about,” said Anthony Collard, head of investments for the UK and Ireland at JPMorgan Private Bank.</p> <p>The Fed's emergency stimulus has lowered borrowing costs and bond yields, in turn driving investors into speculative assets such as early-stage technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. </p> <p>“We are in a position where the Fed is starting to turn that exercise around,” Collard said. “It is a headwind.”</p> <p>Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect US inflation data for November, set to be released on Friday, to show consumer prices rose 6.8 per cent from the same month last year because of pandemic-related disruptions to supply chains and a travel sector rebound. </p> <p>In Asia, a move by Chinese authorities to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21acda99-ee35-4f6d-8cfa-017d55e1bb10\">manage the decline </a>of ailing property developer Evergrande and support the housing market boosted market sentiment. The renminbi rose to Rmb6.33 per dollar, its strongest level since about May 2018. China's CSI 300 share index gained 1.5 per cent, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 added 1.4 per cent. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2021 'Wall Street stocks close in on record highs' FT.com 8 December.
