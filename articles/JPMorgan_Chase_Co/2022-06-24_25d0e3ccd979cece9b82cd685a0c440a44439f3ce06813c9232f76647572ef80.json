  "title": "West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice Strikes Deal Over Greensill Debt; Agreement with Credit Suisse will remove a debt overhang for the governor, who personally guaranteed $850 million in loans",
  "text": "<p>The money, which will be paid in installments, will come from cash generated by Mr. Justice's family coal operations. The once-moribund mines have been resurrected thanks to a rebound in coal prices that began last year. Prices have risen further this year after Russia, a significant coal producer, invaded Ukraine.</p><p>Mr. Justice's son and Bluestone's chief executive, James C. Justice III, said the deal \"enables us to take advantage of the favorable market conditions.\" He added the deal would \"secure the position of the mines, and the employees and communities who depend on them, for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>Bluestone also agreed to split the proceeds of any sale of the coal properties in the future with Credit Suisse and other creditors to further pay down the debt.</p><p>Greensill packaged the loans it made to Mr. Justice and others into notes that were purchased by Credit Suisse investment funds. When Greensill plunged into failure in March 2021, Credit Suisse froze $10 billion of those investor funds. The money Credit Suisse receives from Mr. Justice's companies will go toward paying back the investors in the funds.</p><p>Of the $850 million Mr. Justice's companies borrowed from Greensill, $690 million was owed to Credit Suisse. The rest is owed to the creditors of Greensill's defunct banking unit in Bremen, Germany, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mr. Justice and his family had made personal guarantees on the loans.</p><p>Credit Suisse said this week it has returned about $6.75 billion to investors in the funds so far and has a further $550 million in cash. It has filed 16 insurance claims related to Bluestone and other borrowers as of May, the bank said.</p><p>The freezing of the Greensill funds was a black eye for Credit Suisse, which marketed them as relatively safe investment vehicles for rich clients and institutions.</p><p>Mr. Justice was elected in 2016 as a Democrat, and joined the Republican Party in 2017. He and his family control mining, agricultural and real-estate interests, including West Virginia's Greenbrier resort.</p><p>Mr. Justice sold Bluestone in 2009 to Russian metals and mining company Mechel in a cash-and-stock deal valued at more than $400 million. In 2015, the Justice family bought Bluestone back. Mr. Justice turned to Greensill for loans to rebuild the company, the governor has said.</p><p>Greensill described itself as a technology startup that sought to compete with Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. It offered so-called supply-chain finance, a type of short-term, low-risk cash advance to companies. While Greensill extended financing to a range of blue-chip clients, it also lent money to riskier borrowers.</p><p>Greensill told investors the loans to Bluestone were supply-chain finance deals, but they turned out to be longer-term and more akin to traditional bank loans. When Greensill lost a type of insurance that underpinned the loans, Credit Suisse pulled the plug on the investment funds and Greensill collapsed into bankruptcy.</p><p>The Bluestone companies were one of Greensill's largest clients, the Journal has reported. Mr. Justice said last year that the outstanding loans were \"a burden on our family beyond belief.\"</p><p>The deal with Credit Suisse follows more than a year of negotiations between the Justice family and the Swiss bank. Bluestone has benefited from the run-up in coal prices. The price of Australian metallurgical coal, the international benchmark, has risen more than 90% over the past year, according to Argus Media.</p><p>Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com</p><p>West Virginia Gov.
