  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>Brace yourselves. The coming seven days will be a struggle as the temperatures chill the bones, the post-festive period comedown continues and people grapple with new year's resolutions that will test them to the limit. </p> <p>Across the northern hemisphere, countries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25951ec3-c4e6-427b-b042-275f139bcb98\">have been weighed down</a> by the Omicron coronavirus variant and the Christmas holidays seem an almost distant memory. Diary items this week include inflation updates and details about how climate change has affected (negatively) the weather in the US.</p> <p>Are there any reasons to be cheerful — apart, of course, from the resumption of The Week Ahead newsletter? Well, yes. </p> <p>Covid-19 rules are being loosened for British travellers and Belgians needing to self-isolate. Also, pandemic data are being added to daily, increasing our knowledge of how to tackle Omicron and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d07f4559-f4f5-4063-94e7-c322bdcf62ce\">showing that its spread may have peaked</a> in some places.</p> <p>For English cricket fans, the final Test match in the Ashes series gets under way this week in Hobart, meaning that the daily stream of miserable scoreline news will soon be at an end. Australians cannot only enjoy the spectacle but they can look forward to the start of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne in seven days. And, subject to a court hearing on Monday to decide whether to proceed with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6af906a3-033a-448e-b415-1a2c981cc58f\">deportation of Novak Djokovic</a>, they have the promise of a new men's singles champion.</p> <p>There is likely to be some positive news from corporate diaried items this week. Upbeat reports are expected from several leading retailers and Wall Street banks — see the Companies section below. And the Dutch can look forward to a government finally being installed, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb7a4217-4f77-43bf-9cc0-85e76850bee9\">10 months after the elections</a>. </p> <p>Things might not appear to be getting better generally, but there is always some cause for hope if you look hard enough — email me with your take to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a>.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>The economic data reports this week will begin with EU unemployment figures on Monday. Inflation will also be a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59c73cd5-5332-455e-8a47-9fd0b77fc4d2\">news item</a> (again) with monthly updates from China, the US, India, Japan and France.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>How was your Christmas? This week we will discover <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ff8a9db-9d73-4d7e-903e-083f3a3ad993\">how good it was</a> for a clutch of retailers, mostly in the UK. </p> <p>The process started with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94ee47d6-d6b8-46c8-a8c3-ab53ef7522d2\">bullish updates last Thursday</a> from <strong>Next</strong> — a British retailer that has been upgrading its outlook throughout the past 12 months — and popular bakery chain, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ffe5f17-4684-4d93-aab6-1a16fd2ecb83\"><strong>Greggs</strong></a>. This week's updates might be more mixed.</p> <p>When <strong>Asos</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cda44c7d-f386-4be2-b769-65133ce0d81a\">last updated the market</a>, its&#xa0;chief executive departed&#xa0;and its&#xa0;shares fell almost a fifth. Investors will probably be relieved just to hear that things have not got any worse in “P1” — the company's term for the all-important four months to the end of December. There will also be quarterly results this week from retailers, notably <strong>Fast Retailing</strong>, owner of Uniqlo, on Thursday.</p> <p>Elsewhere, it is the start of the banking reporting season — and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3e4bcce-00fa-43fb-a427-625523cdebdb\">hopes are high</a> after a recent rally in the sector in anticipation of higher interest rates and signs that demand for loans is picking up. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, <strong>Citigroup</strong> and <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> will kick off proceedings on Friday. Investors are watching out for updates on their outlooks for 2022.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, eurozone unemployment rate</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Brunello Cucinelli</strong> FY</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, industrial production figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, British Retail Consortium-KPMG monthly retail sales monitor report</p></li>  <li><p>World Economic Forum publishes its Global Risks Report</p></li> </ul> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>China, India, Russia, US: monthly consumer price index (CPI) data</p></li>  <li><p>EU, India: monthly industrial production figures</p></li>  <li><p>Italy, retail sales figures</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Just Eat Takeaway</strong> Q4 trading update</p></li>  <li><p>UK, 2020-based interim national population projections</p></li>  <li><p>US, Federal Reserve Beige Book published</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Whitbread</strong> Q3 trading update</p></li> </ul> <h2>Thursday</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Asos</strong> trading statement</p></li>  <li><p>China, monthly trade data</p></li>  <li><p>Italy, industrial production figures</p></li>  <li><p>Japan, US: monthly producer price index data</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> Q3 trading update</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Persimmon</strong> trading update</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Tesco</strong> Q3 trading statement</p></li>  <li><p>UK, Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation and KPMG monthly jobs report</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Südzucker</strong> Q3, <strong>Fast Retailing</strong> Q1</p></li> </ul> <h2>Friday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, monthly international trade in goods figures</p></li>  <li><p>France, CPI data</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, full-year GDP figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, monthly GDP estimate, industrial production data, trade figures and productivity data</p></li>  <li><p>US, industrial production and retail sales figures</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Citigroup</strong> Q4, <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> Q4, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> Q4</p></li> </ul> <h1>World events</h1> <p>Finally, here is a rundown of other events and milestones this week. </p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Relaxing of Covid-19 rules comes into effect in Belgium.
