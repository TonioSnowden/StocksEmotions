  "text": "<p>According to filings Monday with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, Musk sold more than 934,000 shares Monday at prices ranging from $6.25 to $1,028 a share.</p><p>In total, Musk has sold about 7.23 million shares for about $7.83 billion since Nov. 8, a day after Musk's Twitter poll decided he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake. Some of the stock sales had been put into motion well before the poll was posted.</p><p>Also see: JPMorgan sues Tesla for $162 million in dispute related to Elon Musk's 2018 tweets</p><p>Musk's selloff last week led to the worst week for Tesla stock in more than a year. Tesla shares TSLA fell nearly 2% Monday, and are down more than 17% since Nov. 8.</p><p>If Musk indeed intends to sell 10% of his shares, he's far from being done. As of last week, his stake amounted to about 17 million shares â€” so he would have about 9.77 million shares to go.</p><p>Musk, the world's wealthiest man, has millions of stock options that he needs to exercise by August 2022, and Musk said in September that he intended on selling a large chunk of stock in the fourth quarter. CNBC reported last week that Musk faced about a $15 billion tax bill on those options.</p><p>Despite the recent tumble, Tesla shares are still up 44% year to date, and have gained 148% over the past 12 months.</p>",
