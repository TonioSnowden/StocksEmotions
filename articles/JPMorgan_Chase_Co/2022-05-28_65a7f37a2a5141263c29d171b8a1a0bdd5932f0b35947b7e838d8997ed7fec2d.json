  "text": "<p>Oliver Zapata Ramirez -- a 25-year-old video editor at a production company in Columbus, Ohio -- says he has cut his driving by about 300 miles a month since March because of high gas prices. He bikes or takes the bus when possible, including commuting to his office, which is about 3 miles from his home.</p><p>\"I try my best not to drive right now,\" said Mr. Zapata Ramirez, noting it costs him $50 to fill half a tank of gas in his 2006 Kia Sportage. That lasts about a week, he said.</p><p>Gasoline demand, measured on a four-week rolling average through May 20, fell to 8.8 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Excluding 2020's steep drop during pandemic lockdowns, the last time average demand for this time of year was lower was in 2013.</p><p>The skittishness comes as gas prices continue to rise. The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. reached $4.60 on Thursday, a 51% increase from a year ago and an all-time high.</p><p>Analysts anticipate that prices won't fall soon. A report from JPMorgan this month said retail gas prices could jump to $6.20 a gallon by August.</p>",
