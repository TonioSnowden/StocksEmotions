  "text": "<p>Consumers are continuing to feel the pinch from high inflation, which rose 8.3% in April from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index.</p><p>Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC, said April sales figures are likely to reflect a short-lived respite last month from rising gas prices, an expected increase in new vehicle sales and volatility in sales by online retailers, which declined sharply in March. \"There's a lot of crosscurrents going on,\" he said.</p><p>Consumer spending, adjusted for inflation and seasonality, accelerated in the first quarter compared with the end of last year, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer spending is a driving force for the U.S. economy.</p><p>There are signs, however, that spending on goods, which make up most of the retail-sales report, is easing as prices continue to rise. Adjusted for inflation, retail sales fell by 0.7% in March, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and economist estimates.</p><p>Sales of vehicles likely rose in April as supply-chain disruptions eased slightly, while spending on gasoline likely declined as prices pulled back briefly from a sharp run-up related the war in Ukraine. Gasoline prices have since risen again, hitting a record high earlier this month.</p><p>Consumers have also shifted some spending to services from goods as a winter surge of Covid-19 from the Omicron variant faded and many people resumed more in-person activities. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s tracker of credit- and debit-card transactions last week showed that consumer spending at restaurants and on entertainment picked up in early May.</p><p>Stephen Purtell, interim chief financial officer at Six Flags Entertainment Corp., said on an earnings call last week that despite recently rising Covid-19 cases, \"people are just learning how to live within that environment, and they're still going out.\"</p><p>After many people earlier in the pandemic focused more of their spending at home, Mr. Purtell said, \"now you see kind of a reversal of that and people wanted to get back out and enjoy experiences, and we don't think that will change.\"</p><p>Larry Isacson, a retired information-technology executive in the pharmaceutical industry, took a trip to Las Vegas and Utah in April and paid $400 a night for a hotel in St. George, Utah.</p><p>\"That would have seemed exorbitant a few years ago, for a room with not that many amenities,\" he said. \"I just basically had to swallow it and accept that that's what the rate is, and I want to be there so I have to pay the rate.\"</p><p>Mr. Isacson said that the hotels around where he lives in Laguna Niguel, Calif., appear to be doing well. He added, \"Clearly people are in the mood to spend.\"</p><p>Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Retail Sales Grew 0.9% in April</p>",
