  "title": "MANSION --- Jumbo Jungle: Home-Equity Loans Dry Up --- Once a staple of financing for homeowners, Helocs are harder to find as banks shift their attention to refis",
  "text": "<p>Wells Fargo suspended the origination of new Helocs after April 2020 and hasn't determined when it might begin offering that product again, according to company spokesman Tom Goyda. \"Throughout the Covid pandemic, Wells Fargo has continued to provide mortgage credit to customers looking to purchase a home or to lower their monthly payments through a refinance,\" Mr. Goyda said in an email. \"As the pandemic unfolded last year, Wells Fargo made a few changes that we believe best served the interest of our customers in the long term and addressed concerns related to health and safety, credit and market risks and prudent balance-sheet management.\"</p><p>Those changes included the suspension of Heloc originations. And, while Wells Fargo has since reversed most of the underwriting limitations it put in place and has resumed the origination of cash-out refinances, Helocs are still suspended, Mr. Goyda said.</p><p>Wells Fargo joined JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which temporarily suspended applications for new Helocs in April 2020. Chase, which declined to comment, states on its website that due to the economic uncertainty created by Covid, it is temporarily not accepting applications for new home-equity lines of credit to protect both the consumer and the bank. Citibank's website contains similar language regarding its suspension of Heloc applications after March 3, 2021, due to \"current market conditions.\"</p><p>But while other lenders have scaled back their Heloc programs, Bank of America Corp. continued to lend, albeit with tighter credit standards. Those standards have since been relaxed.</p><p>\"Last April, at the outset of the pandemic, we saw increased unemployment, decreased consumer confidence and concerns about housing-market stability, and there was a fear of a severe and prolonged recession,\" said Ann Thompson, head of retail sales, west, consumer lending for Bank of America. \"We were also informed by lessons from the financial crisis, where equity quickly eroded and some clients defaulted on their debts in second position.\"</p><p>Since a Heloc is typically a second mortgage on a home, in the event of a foreclosure, the holder of a second mortgage doesn't get paid unless there is sufficient equity in the property after the first mortgage is paid off.</p><p>Bank of America originally mitigated its risk by implementing tighter credit standards, raising applicant FICO scores and lowering the maximum debt-to-income ratio. It also stopped lending to borrowers who weren't existing bank customers. \"We felt comfortable lending to our own clients with the curtailed guidelines,\" Ms. Thompson said. \"With loan-to-value and loan-amount maximums reduced as well, we felt that lending to our own clients was responsible.\"</p><p>During the first quarter of 2021, because of the improved economic outlook and the vaccine rollout, the bank started to roll back those requirements to pre-pandemic levels, making it easier for borrowers to meet its standards and qualify for a Heloc.</p><p>\"There is pent-up demand for Helocs,\" Ms. Thompson said. \"It's an opportunity for the client we want within our guidelines.\"</p><p>Mortgage-industry experts speculate why banks might have exited the Heloc market last year. \"There were concerns about risk, but also operational challenges because some of the large banks saw enormous waves of refinance demand last year,\" said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. \"Some of them moved staff that previously was working on the home-equity business to work on refinances.\"</p><p>Mr. Fratantoni said there were also capital-reserve and liquidity requirements that encouraged banks to shift their attention to other products, such as cash-out refinances, and that borrowers are shifting away from Helocs. \"Homeowner psychology has changed a bit,\" he said. \"Customers seem a little more hesitant about tapping their home equity. That's why we're expecting very modest growth in Helocs.\"</p><p>Industry experts expect the three major national banks to eventually begin offering Helocs again, but the product will be rolled out carefully. \"I would expect lenders to slowly start doing Helocs, but only where they are already in the first-lien position,\" said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree. \"Then, if somebody defaults, the risk of loss is pretty low.\"</p>",
