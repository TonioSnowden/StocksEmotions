  "text": "<p>With consumers now adept at online shopping, most retailers had a pretty decent Christmas in the end. <strong>Primark</strong> is a bit of an anomaly, because it doesn't do ecommerce. So while sales for the 16 weeks to early January were up 36 per cent year-on-year, that comparison is against a period in late 2020 when lots of Primark's stores were closed. Total Primark sales were 5 per cent lower than pre-Covid levels, and like-for-like sales were 11 per cent lower. </p> <p>But despite supply chain disruption, rising raw materials costs and extended shipping times, operating profit margins at Primark have been better than expected. They should be above 10 per cent for the first half of the financial year, Primark's owner <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> said. ABF also said that there has been an “encouraging improvement in footfall” in the UK as Omicron reduces. </p> <p>Across the wider ABF group, which includes grocery, sugar, agriculture and ingredients divisions, revenues were up 5 per cent year-on-year. Though high sugar prices and a rebound in demand for its ingredients business both helped, ABF said all units had experienced inflationary pressures with margins in grocery and ingredients hit as moves to increase sales prices had lagged the effects of inflation in input costs. </p> <p><em>Tell me what you think. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> said growth last year was at the top end of expectations, gaining market share in the UK and expanding its international business. The value of orders made through its platform — gross transaction value or GTV — rose 70 per cent in 2021 at constant exchange rates. It had forecast growth of between 60 and 70 per cent. The value of orders fell slightly, though Deliveroo said it had stabilised in the final quarter of the year. GTV rose 33 per cent year-on-year in the quarter.</p> <p>Gambling group <strong>Entain</strong>, which owns Ladbrokes and Bwin, said earnings would be better than expected thanks to “strong growth” in all major markets apart from Germany, where new gambling laws have been introduced. Entain said its US joint venture BetMGM was a “particular highlight” and should turn profitable in 2023. </p> <p>Investment platform <strong>AJ Bell</strong> reported a 4 per cent rise in customer numbers in the quarter, with net inflows of £1.3bn. The pace of growth has predictably slowed from a year ago when the retail trading boom was in full swing.</p> <p>Also out today is a fourth quarter update from home retailer <strong>Wickes</strong>, which has a new CFO, high-street brand <strong>Superdry</strong>, consumer goods group <strong>Premier Foods</strong> and online pension provider <strong>PensionBee</strong>. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>US bank earnings</strong> week continues. Yesterday it was the turn of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. </p> <p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> raised a crucial profitability target and set a goal of lifting its client assets from $6.5tn to $10tn as part of its push into asset and wealth management. The bank reported a 10 per cent rise in profits for the final quarter of last year, and said it would aim for a “longer term” return on tangible common equity (a key measure of profitability) of at least 20 per cent, up from an earlier 17 per cent target. Rival JPMorgan has a 17 per cent “medium-term” target. US banking editor Joshua Franklin has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7c1961f-09c4-4109-8c25-89acb00264b9\">more details</a>. </p> <p><strong>Bank of America</strong> meanwhile reported record annual profits for last year, and presented a bullish outlook for 2022 in anticipation of rate rises and a revival in lending. Quarterly profit for the US's second-largest bank by assets rose 28 per cent, boosted by record revenues in wealth management and investment banking. The full story comes from US banking correspondent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48ac87fd-2cd5-4cff-8a13-678b6bbc86e6\">Imani Moise</a>. </p> <p>Together <strong>Wall Street's</strong> leading banks raised <strong>pay</strong> by almost 15 per cent last year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bdef7a6-69f1-4f42-b27d-74dd34db4804\">shelling out</a> a whopping $142bn in pay and benefits amid a war for talent. </p> <p>Less upbeat overnight was US carrier <strong>United Airlines</strong>, which said it expected to fly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f76678f-f283-4d12-9956-504185bdaa64#post-224d514b-6882-4c44-93d3-631bbadc60b2\">less than previously planned</a> this year after the Omicron variant of Covid-19 hits to consumer demand. United said it now expected 2022 capacity to fall compared with 2019. Three months ago it forecast a rise of 5 per cent. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>This week I write about <strong>Lloyd's of London</strong> and the news that the insurance market might move out of its iconic <strong>Richard Rogers building</strong>. Personally, I love the building (does anyone not, apart from maybe Prince Charles?) even though those who've worked there over the years tell me it's not actually great as an office space. But in my column I argue that as working patterns (finally) change in the insurance industry, Lloyd's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1129d4c6-9bc9-4753-b65e-d9475eab93ca\">cannot afford to be sentimental</a> about an expensive space that no longer meets its members' needs. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2022 'Primark sales stuck below pre-Covid levels' FT.com 20 January.
