  "title": "A Daunting Promotion Gave This Finance Executive Confidence to Launch His Own Company; After a 'huge stretch opportunity,' Rick McVey went on to start the dominant online marketplace for corporate bonds",
  "text": "<p>Yet that experience gave the former futures trader confidence to launch MarketAxess Holdings Inc. four years later. Mr. McVey's startup grew into the dominant online marketplace for trading corporate bonds.</p><p>The New York company facilitated $6.6 trillion in trading during 2020—the year after its addition to the S&amp;P 500. MarketAxess has reported 12 consecutive years of record volume, revenue and earnings.</p><p>It offers venues and tools for banks, investment managers and others to trade electronically. About 41% of the $20.3 billion in investment-grade corporate bonds that changed hands this July were traded electronically, up from 26% in July of 2019, according to Greenwich Associates. Historically, most bond trading had been conducted by phone.</p><p>Bio Bits</p><p>* Age: 62</p><p>* Education: Bachelor's degree in finance from Ohio's Miami University and M.B.A. degree from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business.</p><p>* Family: Wife Lara Spencer plus daughters ages 32, 31 and 27</p><p>* Workout routine: Running, elliptical and strength training; aim for four times a week.</p><p>* Management mantra: Lead by example.</p><p>* Fun fact: Wife is co-host of ABC's 'Good Morning America.'</p><p>* Worst advice ever received: Don't move to New York!</p><p>Mentors urge Mr. McVey to take calculated risks in leading MarketAxess \"by choosing bold ideas backed by data and key partners with skin in the game,\" the 62-year-old chief executive says.</p><p>Mr. McVey, the son of an entrepreneur, lived in Mentor, Ohio, until the eighth grade—when his family relocated to another Cleveland suburb. The youth liked math and financial-markets lessons from his father, an active investor who owned a heating-oil business.</p><p>Mr. McVey majored in finance at Ohio's Miami University, focusing on investment management during his senior year. He next pursued an M.B.A. degree at Indiana University. Summer internships in bank treasury departments offered a close-up look at their paper-based processes—and influenced his subsequent commitment to using technology to improve efficiency.</p><p>Upon completing graduate school in 1983, Mr. McVey joined Ameritrust as a highly specialized futures trader. Discount Corp., a government-securities dealer, hired him the following year to be an institutional futures broker on the noisy floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p><p>Mr. McVey developed strong ties with banking clients such as J.P. Morgan, which recruited him to run its Chicago futures operations in 1992. Four years later, he moved to New York for what he still calls his \"huge stretch opportunity'' with the fixed-income role.</p><p>\"The one time I took a career risk that scared the hell out of me was that job,'' he adds.</p><p>He didn't feel ready for the big increase in responsibility, however. \"The scary part was managing a group of extremely talented and ambitious people that knew more about my job than I did,\" Mr. McVey recalls.</p><p>J.P. Morgan and several other banks backed his subsequent creation of MarketAxess in 2000. His former employer also gave the startup free office space—with mismatched furniture.</p><p>For a few years, MarketAxess struggled to attract customers. \"We had three or four near-death experiences,\" he says. The company was profitable by 2004, the year it went public.</p><p>MarketAxess hit tough times again when bond trading froze during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. McVey's substantial stake in his business lost more than $55 million of value between late 2007 and late 2008, he estimates. \"That was a gut-wrenching period,\" he says.</p><p>Mentors reassured Mr. McVey that big investors and banks would still need MarketAxess post-crisis. Here are four of his most trusted advisers:</p><p>Nicolas Rohatyn</p><p>CEO and founder of Rohatyn Group</p><p>Mr. Rohatyn supervised Mr. McVey at J.P. Morgan in the late 1990s. When his lieutenant devised the idea for MarketAxess, Mr. Rohatyn marshaled extensive internal support for the new business.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was surprised Mr. McVey would take such a significant career and financial risk. Mr. Rohatyn says he warned the budding entrepreneur that \"survival was far from assured.\" Dozens of electronic bond platforms made their debuts around the same time.</p><p>Amid MarketAxess's difficult early days, Mr. McVey often turned to his prior boss for guidance. \"Stay focused on what you can control,\" including costs, he recollects Mr. Rohatyn suggesting. And find ways \"to adapt strategically to the situation.\"</p><p>Mr. Rohatyn founded his own asset-management firm in 2002. He remains CEO of that business and a good McVey friend. Few early rivals of MarketAxess exist today.</p><p>Carlos Hernandez</p><p>Executive chair of investment and corporate banking for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>The men became close colleagues in 1996. Living three blocks apart in the New York City suburb of Bronxville, N.Y., they occasionally commuted together.</p><p>Mr. Hernandez accepted a MarketAxess board seat in 2006. \"He became our most optimistic champion\" during the financial crisis, Mr. McVey remembers. Mr. Hernandez correctly insisted that the company would flourish as credit markets recovered and bank regulation increased.</p><p>Around six years ago, Mr. Hernandez proposed that his protégé market MarketAxess more aggressively rather than continue attracting clients mostly by word of mouth. \"I told Rick it was time to tell the world that MarketAxess had arrived with a little more swagger,\" Mr. Hernandez recalls.</p><p>Mr. McVey hired a chief marketing officer with extensive Wall Street experience and a recommendation from Mr. Hernandez. During the next two years, MarketAxess tripled its annual marketing budget—and revenue rose a total of 18%.</p><p>Richie Prager</p><p>A former senior managing director of BlackRock Inc.</p><p>Mr. Prager has talked regularly with Mr. McVey since joining BlackRock, a MarketAxess client, in 2008.</p><p>\"Our relationship has been built on finding solutions together,\" Mr. Prager explains. In 2013, they created a strategic alliance that allowed certain BlackRock clients to trade corporate bonds directly with each other through MarketAxess.</p><p>The BlackRock partnership eventually became Open Trading, a MarketAxess product that enables all of its clients and dealers to trade directly with one another anonymously. The platform connects clients as disparate as Midwestern insurers and South African hedge funds. It can bypass banks that historically would have served as the sole middlemen.</p><p>Mr. Prager counseled Mr. McVey about how he could accelerate big banks' acceptance of Open Trading. They crafted specific strategies for each resistant bank. \"He helped me to get the banks more comfortable with the change,\" Mr. McVey says. Banks presently use the platform to trade with clients in both new and traditional ways.</p><p>Nancy Altobello</p><p>Professional board member</p><p>In 2019, Mr. McVey sought advice from the newest MarketAxess board member about managing his rapidly expanding workforce.</p><p>\"I encouraged him to put talent at the top of the list of strategic priorities and then use that to the company's strategic advantage on a global scale,\" Ms. Altobello recollects. As global vice chair of talent for Ernst &amp; Young until 2018, she led such strategies for more than 250,000 EY staffers world-wide.</p><p>Mr. McVey says he embraced her approach. For instance, he expanded the board compensation committee's duties to cover talent companywide, rather than just executive pay.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What factors have helped make up your mind to take a risk in your career? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Nowadays, Ms. Altobello coaches the longtime CEO about succession planning during their frequent get-togethers in his Greenwich, Conn., backyard. She wants Mr. McVey to groom a successor who has demonstrated what she calls \"followership\" skills: an executive able to attract loyal followers by leading well, she explains. Such individuals, she adds, build teams \"willing to stick with this leader even in tough times.\"</p><p>Write to Joann S.
