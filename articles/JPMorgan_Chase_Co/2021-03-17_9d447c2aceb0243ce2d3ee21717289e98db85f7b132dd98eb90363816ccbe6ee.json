  "text": "<p>The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that retail sales dropped 3% in February from January, which was more than the modest decline economists had expected. On the other hand, January's sales jump was revised to an increase of 7.6% from a gain of 5.3%.</p><p>The causes of the zig and zag in sales aren't hard to figure out. January sales were boosted by the government payments that began to arrive in late December. The fading of that boost would have been a drag on February sales, and then winter storms hit, including the one that left millions of people in Texas without power.</p><p>Credit-card data from Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase show that sales so far this month rebounded from February -- and that is before the next set of government payments which are now on the verge of hitting many Americans' bank accounts. Throw in the arrival of warmer weather that makes pandemic workarounds easier as well as the general sense of relief that the end of the Covid-19 crisis may be in sight, and March retail sales could be quite strong.</p><p>Nor will that likely be the end of it. At the recent pace of vaccination, over half of U.S. adults will have received at least one vaccine dose by the end of April, and over two-thirds will have received one by Memorial Day weekend at the end of May. Many people will be a lot more comfortable returning to activities such as going to restaurants and taking trips. And with that, there should be a shift in spending.</p><p>The Commerce Department's retail sales report skews heavily toward the goods sectors that have in many cases actually benefited from the pandemic, such as hardware stores, supermarkets on online retailers. Overall, retail sales last month were up 6.3% from a year earlier, right before the crisis took hold.</p><p>The categories that have taken big sales hits are restaurants and bars, clothing stores and department stores. The easing of the pandemic could benefit all three -- restaurants and bars because people will be itching to go out again, and clothing and department stores because as people go out again and make their first forays back into the office, they are going to care what they look like.</p><p>The bigger question is whether sales by the pandemic's winners will be able to keep increasing. A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats, but what if some boats are already lifted?</p>",
