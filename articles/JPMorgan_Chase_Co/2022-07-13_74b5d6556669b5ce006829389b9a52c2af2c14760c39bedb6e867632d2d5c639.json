  "title": "U.S. News: Fed Nominee Barr Advances in Senate",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Barr's confirmation would provide the central bank with a full seven-member board for the first time in nearly a decade and would add to a group of Biden-appointed financial watchdogs. Mr. Barr has a record that suggests he might seek to restore at least some of the financial rules that were eased by the Fed during the Trump administration.</p><p>The supervision role that Mr. Barr would fill is responsible for developing a broad vision for the regulation of big banks. That includes recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p>",
