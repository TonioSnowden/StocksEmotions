  "title": "World News: Colombia Vote Weighs on Oil Sector",
  "text": "<p>Polls show the hopefuls in a dead heat. Gustavo Petro, a former leftist guerrilla who later served in the Senate, calls oil a poison and says he would cease granting exploration licenses. Construction mogul Rodolfo Hernandez expresses his distaste for fracking in his TikTok videos, though he casts doubt on Colombia's ability to transition quickly.</p><p>\"We need a change to shift to a new era,\" Mr. Petro told supporters in the town of San Andres de Sotavento in May. \"We need an economy that is protective of the environment, not one based on oil or gas.\"</p><p>The energy industry is at the forefront of the presidential race at a paradoxical moment since Colombian exporters -- and government coffers -- are benefiting from the rise in global oil prices driven by war in Ukraine. Energy company Ecopetrol, which is majority-owned by the Colombian state and joining with Exxon Mobil Corp. in the fracking pilot, reported first-quarter profit that more than doubled from the previous year.</p><p>For more than a decade, Colombia has been working to expand its dwindling oil reserves, estimated at a little more than two billion barrels, tiny compared with the estimated 300 billion in neighboring Venezuela. Colombia pumps 700,000 barrels a day and has about seven years of oil remaining, according to its Ministry of Mines and Energy.</p><p>With fracking, Colombia could add more than five billion barrels of light crude to its stock, giving it enough oil and gas to last up to three decades, said Gabriel Combariza, vice president of unconventional resources at Ecopetrol.</p><p>\"We're not a country with a lot of tangible riches, and so we have to go out and look for them,\" Mr. Combariza said.</p><p>Without the investment necessary to maintain current production levels, the country could become a net importer of crude within five years, according to the Colombian Petroleum Association, which advocates for the oil industry.</p><p>A decline in oil output, the association warns, would mean less export revenue, a third of which comes from oil sales to the U.S. If production declines below domestic demand by 2026-27, the government would lose out on $4.5 billion in tax and royalty payments by that time.</p><p>Ecopetrol and the administration of President Ivan Duque, whose term ends in August, have sought to protect the industry. The company's shareholders in March approved a move to extend the terms of its nine-member executive board until 2025. But a new administration could try to change the management structure of the state company, J.P. Morgan credit researchers said in a recent report.</p><p>Ecopetrol's stock is up 7% in 2022, well shy of the 42% rise of S&amp;P's energy stock index.</p><p>The Petro campaign, which has been the most vocal on oil matters, says the candidate supports only a gradual transformation of the national energy apparatus and introduction of new taxes on the sector. Existing contracts, including the 69 exploration licenses granted during Mr. Duque's tenure, would also be respected, the Petro campaign said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Puerto Wilches, anti-fracking demonstrators who support Mr. Petro's positions have in recent days blocked roads as well as the entrance to the mayor's office, demanding local authorities stop the fracking program to prevent what they assert will be environmental damage. Many of the 30,000 people who live here depend on farming and fishing in the adjacent Magdalena River.</p><p>Colombia's highest administrative court said this month that the fracking project could proceed, overturning a ban applied by a local judge.</p>",
