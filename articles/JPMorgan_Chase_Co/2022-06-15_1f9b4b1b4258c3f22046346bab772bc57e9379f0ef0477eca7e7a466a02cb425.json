  "title": "Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits; Facing pressure to act on gasoline prices, president says he is ready to use emergency measures to raise output if necessary",
  "text": "<p>The president called on the companies to take immediate action to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. He said his administration was prepared to use its emergency authorities to increase capacity in the near term, if necessary.</p><p>Mr. Biden added that he had directed Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to hold an emergency meeting and to engage with the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that represents the oil industry.</p><p>\"We see it as a patriotic duty,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday, ramping up pressure on the companies to boost capacity. Asked what measures the Biden administration might take if the companies don't take sufficient action, she said Mr. Biden would weigh using the Defense Production Act, but declined to offer additional details.</p><p>Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress are facing pressure to respond to gasoline prices that have recently topped $5 a gallon, a key driver of the rapid inflation that is weighing on American consumers ahead of midterm elections this year. A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found that the public is widely dissatisfied with the economy, frustrations that are dragging down Mr. Biden's approval ratings.</p><p>But Mr. Biden's short-term options for lowering gasoline prices are limited, according to analysts, and the steps he has taken have done little to slow surging prices. Without an easy fix, the president has increasingly blamed oil companies and sought to convince the public that prices at the pump are out of his control, pointing Russia's war in Ukraine as the main driver.</p><p>Mr. Biden's letter was sent to Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips 66, Chevron Corp., BP and Shell. Mr. Biden requested that the companies provide his administration with an explanation of any reductions in capacity since 2020 as well as ideas for addressing high prices.</p><p>Exxon pointed to an expansion project to boost capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery by 250,000 barrels a day, to run light sweet crude pumped from U.S. shale plays, as evidence that it was doing its part to raise domestic output. It said the U.S. government could boost supplies by issuing Jones Act waivers allowing shippers to move supplies around domestically on much bigger vessels, and waive some fuel specifications. Exxon added that the U.S. government could also enable more investment in oil by having more predictable lease sales and streamlining approvals for pipelines.</p><p>Shell said it is producing as much as it can from its relatively small U.S. refinery footprint and is exploring other options, including accelerating efforts to lift oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and repurposing an idled refinery in Louisiana to make lower-carbon fuel.</p><p>Valero said it is expanding its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.</p><p>U.S. refineries closed about 1 million barrels a day of capacity during the pandemic, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Fuel makers have been running full tilt in recent weeks, though last week the amount of operable capacity refineries were using slipped about half a percentage point from the prior week to 93.7%, a drop most pronounced on the West Coast. Refiners in the East Coast were running at 98.3% capacity; in the Gulf Coast, 96.5%, according to data released Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Meanwhile, inventories of crude oil and petroleum products were the lowest since 2008. Gasoline stocks were down 25% from this time last year; diesel stocks were down almost 27%. Exports of gasoline and diesel were both up about 11% from this time a year ago, EIA data showed.</p><p>The Biden administration has taken several steps to address high gasoline prices, with limited success. The U.S. has released oil from the country's strategic stockpiles in coordination with other nations and allowed high-ethanol content gasoline to be sold in the summer months.</p><p>White House officials said Mr. Biden is considering additional measures, including calling for a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax.</p><p>The Biden administration has faced criticism from Republicans and some in the oil industry for energy policies that they see as too restrictive. Mr. Biden has said the U.S. should shift away from fossil fuels in the long term in response to climate change. But as prices have risen, he has said the U.S. must expand supply in the shorter term to help consumers.</p><p>The Biden administration can do little to quickly alleviate consumers' pain at the pump, or increase refineries' capacity and fuel supplies, analysts say. Refineries are making money now but have operated on far thinner margins in recent years, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when economic lockdowns led to a historic crash in demand.</p><p>Before the pandemic, fuel demand was plateauing in developed economies and sales of electric vehicles were rising. Meanwhile, regulators have stepped up fuel-efficiency standards that have led vehicles to use less gasoline.</p><p>In recent years, some oil companies have sold off refineries and shut others down amid anemic margins. Last year, Shell sold refinery stakes in Washington state, Alabama, and Texas, but couldn't find a buyer for a facility in Louisiana, and later said it would close it and repurpose it to make lower-carbon fuel. Restarting that refinery as a traditional oil refinery would take several years, Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phillips 66 closed a weather-damaged oil refinery in Belle Chasse, La., following Hurricane Ida, and said it would convert it to a terminal facility. The Environmental Protection Agency ordered the company that was then running another refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands to pause operations last year following \"multiple major mishaps\" involving releases of pollutants and oil.</p><p>One option for the Biden administration is to expedite the EPA's permitting process for that St. Croix refinery to restart, after the refinery's new owners make improvements to its operations, said John Auers, executive vice president at energy consulting firm Turner, Mason &amp; Co. That could add 200,000 barrels a day of capacity by next year.</p><p>Other refinery shutdowns are likely irreversible at this point, Mr. Auers said. He said the prospect for many more refinery expansions is dim, given that policy makers and the investment community are encouraging an energy transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>\"Short-term, margins are good, but the long-term view that we're moving away from oil still exists,\" Mr. Auers said.</p><p>Some refineries, in pursuit of high margins on fuel, are already running at extremely high rates that, if sustained for too long, could risk breakdowns or worse, said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho.</p><p>\"He is playing a dangerous game putting pressure on them,\" Mr. Yawger said of Mr. Biden.</p><p>Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits</p>",
