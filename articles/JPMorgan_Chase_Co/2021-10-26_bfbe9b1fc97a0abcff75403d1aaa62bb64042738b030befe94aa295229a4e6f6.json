  "text": "<p>Asks for New Trial</p><p>A lawyer for Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman asked a federal appeals court in Manhattan on Monday to grant him a new trial, saying a media report of alleged juror misconduct was reason to overturn his conviction for running a narcotics empire.</p><p>Mr. Guzman is currently serving a life sentence after a federal jury in Brooklyn found him guilty in 2019 of 10 criminal counts in connection with leading the Sinaloa drug cartel.</p><p>Days after the conviction, Vice Media Group published a story anonymously quoting one of the jurors saying that several jurors disobeyed a judge's instructions to avoid news reports during the trial. Juries are routinely instructed of the rules to ensure the defendant gets a fair and impartial trial.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ruled in July 2019 that the alleged misconduct didn't merit an inquiry, even if the juror's comments in the Vice story were true. The \"mountain range of evidence\" introduced at the trial would have led a rational, average juror to convict Mr. Guzman of the charges, the judge said in his opinion at the time.</p><p>Marc Fernich, Mr. Guzman's lawyer, said Monday in oral arguments before a panel of three judges of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the media articles could have colored jurors' impression of his client. He argued that a hearing should be held to determine whether the juror's allegations in the story were true.</p><p>Assistant U.S. attorney Hiral Mehta told the judges that a hearing isn't merited because there was no clear evidence that the alleged misconduct biased jurors.</p><p>-- James Fanelli</p><p>---</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>Republicans Push to</p><p>Keep Tech From China</p><p>Republican China hawks in Congress are pressuring the Commerce Department to fortify export controls to keep critical American technology from falling into Beijing's hands.</p><p>Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo last week, urged action to address 10 issues of \"immediate concern\" -- from strengthening export controls on semiconductors and jet engines to updating the list of technologies earmarked for protection from foreign rivals.</p><p>The letter, from the committee's top Republican, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, and signed by 16 other Republicans, follows a move this month by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee to hold up confirmation of Alan Estevez, President Biden's nominee to lead the Commerce unit in charge of export controls.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Commerce Department said it is dedicated to \"promoting U.S. exports and technology leadership for the benefit of U.S. companies and workers.\" She also said the agency seeks to protect U.S. national security and promote democratic values.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, it has put export controls on seven Chinese supercomputing entities for their support of China's military, and 14 other Chinese entities that have enabled the country's human-rights abuses, she said.</p><p>-- Kate O'Keeffe</p><p>---</p><p>TEXAS</p><p>Gov. Abbott Signs</p><p>Redrawn Voting Maps</p><p>Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed redrawn voting maps Monday, ending a highly charged year over voting rights in Texas, where Democrats this summer left the state to begin a 38-day holdout in protest of a sweeping elections overhaul.</p><p>Civil-rights groups have already filed federal lawsuits that accuse GOP map makers of disenfranchising Hispanic and Black residents who are driving the state's rapid growth. Texas added four million new residents since 2010, but under the new U.S. House maps, Republicans added no new districts where Latinos hold a majority.</p><p>Texas Republicans have defended the maps, saying race wasn't taken into account, except for when preserving equal representation. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman, who authored the maps and leads the Senate Redistricting Committee, told fellow lawmakers that they were \"drawn blind to race.\"</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>---</p><p>TREASURY</p><p>Job Created to Focus</p><p>On Racial Equity</p><p>The Treasury Department said Monday it has created a new position to support the Biden administration's efforts to promote economic opportunities for communities of color as the nation recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Janis Bowdler, who most recently worked as president of the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Foundation, will become the department's first counselor for racial equity, the Treasury said. Ms. Bowdler will be tasked with coordinating \"efforts to advance racial equity including engaging with diverse communities throughout the country and to identify and mitigate barriers to accessing benefits and opportunities with the department,\" the Treasury said.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the position would help address longstanding economic inequities experienced by communities of color that had been amplified by the pandemic.</p><p>\"Treasury must play a central role in ensuring that as our economy recovers from the pandemic, it recovers in a way that addresses the inequalities that existed long before anyone was infected with Covid-19,\" Ms. Yellen said.</p><p>-- Amara Omeokwe</p><p>---</p><p>IDAHO</p><p>Two Dead, Four Hurt</p><p>In Mall Shooting</p><p>A suspect was in custody after two people were killed and four injured -- including a police officer -- in a shooting at a shopping mall Monday in Boise, police said.</p><p>At a news conference, authorities said officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect. The majority of the Boise Towne Square mall had been cleared, but police were still looking for any additional victims.</p><p>Police didn't release any other information about the victims or the suspect, saying the investigation was ongoing.</p><p>About a quarter of a mile from the mall, officers closed part of a road so they could investigate a second crime scene related to the shooting incident. Officers at the second crime scene declined to answer questions about the investigation other than to confirm it was related to the shooting.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
