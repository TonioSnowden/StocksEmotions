We apologise for the technical error.</p> <h2>The under-the-radar buyout firm backing Todd Boehly's Chelsea bid&#xa0;</h2> <p>Business is booming in the US private equity industry. So much so that when a globally renowned sports team comes up for sale, there's now a good chance it could be purchased by billionaire dealmakers with almost no name recognition outside of the most plugged-in Wall Street watchers. </p> <p>This is the case in the more than £4.25bn sale of <strong>Chelsea</strong> <strong>Football Club</strong> to a group of investors backed by Santa Monica, California-based <strong>Clearlake</strong> <strong>Capital</strong> — one of the private equity industry's least known but fastest-growing firms.</p> <p>The firm's two co-founders — <strong>José E.</strong> <strong>Feliciano</strong> and <strong>Behdad</strong> <strong>Eghbali — </strong>are supporting their friend <strong>Todd Boehly</strong>, the billionaire founder of <strong>Eldridge Industries</strong>, Swiss billionaire <strong>Hansjörg Wyss</strong>, <strong>Guggenheim Partners</strong> chief <strong>Mark Walter </strong>and UK Conservative party peer-slash-<strong>Times</strong> columnist <strong>Daniel Finkelstein</strong> to provide the financial firepower to back their £4.25bn bid for the football club.</p> <p>Not only is Clearlake funding over 60 per cent of the equity of the deal, Feliciano and Eghbali are also using their own money on a bid for the <strong>Denver</strong> <strong>Broncos</strong>, the US football franchise. That sale could fetch an even higher price.</p> <p>Both prospective deals are the most prominent for a firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5a4435d-7ebf-4b00-a156-403a468bb964\">that has quietly become</a> one of the most active buyers of midsized companies in the US, DD's Antoine Gara reports. </p> <p>Clearlake's deal pace is funded by a torrent of $25bn in new cash that has poured into the firm over the past year, pushing its overall assets over $75bn.</p> <p>Launched in 2006 by Feliciano, a native of Bayamón, Puerto Rico, and Eghbali, who emigrated from Iran to the Los Angeles area in 1986, Clearlake targets specialised but highly profitable companies in the consumer goods, industrials and tech sectors that it grows through debt-financed acquisitions.</p> <p>With these specialised takeovers, Clearlake's flagship funds raised between 2013 and 2018 have earned net returns of between 34 per cent and 56 per cent, according to public pension fund disclosures.</p> <p>Though its deals are niche, Clearlake has perfected a tactic increasingly adopted by powerhouse competitors like <strong>Blackstone</strong>.</p> <p>It has become Wall Street's biggest user of “GP-led secondaries”, the latest trend in the private equity realm. Here's how it works: Clearlake finds another private equity company to buy a large portion of one of its existing investments. Investors are then given the option of selling their stakes at the new valuation, or rolling them into a new fund that will hold the investment for about four more years.</p> <p>Clearlake has struck five of these types of deals, raising $8.5bn in assets, and realising more than $10bn in investments over the past two years.</p> <p>Blackstone used the same technique in its $14.6bn sale of <strong>BioMed</strong> <strong>Realty</strong> in 2020 and its €21bn recapitalisation of European logistics giant <strong>Mileway</strong> in February. Late last year, <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> used the same strategy to sell a majority of its investment in automotive repair company <strong>Belron</strong>, also at a €21bn valuation, to <strong>Hellman</strong> <strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>Friedman</strong>.</p> <p>Clearlake, which sold a 20 per cent stake in the firm at a $4bn valuation in 2018, is now drawing interest from bankers who are watching what Feliciano and Eghbali do with the remaining 80 per cent of the firm they still own.</p> <p>Bankers have been pitching to take the firm public — an option the group is studying but has yet to make a decision on.</p> <p>“Wouldn't this be the next tool in terms of value creation? If anyone is going to do it, it would be someone like Clearlake,” one banker told DD.</p> <h2>Beijing's regulatory ‘big bang' sounds muffled in hindsight</h2> <p>In 2020, Beijing blew open its tightly controlled financial system for foreign bankers in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">regulatory “big bang”</a>.</p> <p>Western institutions with investment banking partnerships in China's mainland including <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad1a8608-1069-4f9b-bf26-5dd9ae03f0a8\"><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong></a> and <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>were finally allowed to assume full control of their joint venture operations there after years of losses or subpar returns.</p> <p>Nearly two years on, Wall Street's efforts in the country have begun to turn a corner. But they're not out of the woods just yet.</p> <p>Six out of the seven Wall Street and European lenders with investment banking ventures in mainland China <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daa35e03-a7c9-4bb1-aa02-27eafbdfe2e5\">made a profit in 2021</a>, the FT's Tabby Kinder and Cheng Leng report.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9907648.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The pay-off is long overdue for some. Morgan Stanley led the race to China in 1995, forming <strong>China International Capital Corporation</strong> (CICC) — <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3161610/chinas-regulator-cites-investment-bank-cicc-negligence\">which has since been dubbed </a>“the Goldman Sachs of China” — with state-owned<strong> China Construction Bank</strong>. </p> <p>But the US bank never reaped the rewards. Management clashes resulted in the Wall Street bank selling off its stake to private equity groups <strong>KKR</strong> and <strong>TPG</strong>, before setting up a new joint venture with <strong>Huaxin Securities </strong>in 2011.</p> <p>After increasing its ownership of the unit to 90 per cent, Morgan Stanley's mainland onshore investment bank at last generated a profit of Rmb30mn ($4.5mn) in 2021 after bleeding a combined $38mn in the three years prior.</p> <p>JPMorgan became the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98b13d5a-2189-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\">first US bank</a> to win approval to launch a majority-owned Chinese securities business last year, generating profits of $11mn. Goldman similarly turned a profit of $12mn after gaining full ownership of its 18-year partnership with <strong>Gao Hua Securities</strong> and this week relocated its Singapore chief<strong> Eg Morse </strong>to Shanghai to lead its work in China.</p> <p><strong>HSBC </strong>— despite a bold plan by its chief executive <strong>Noel Quinn </strong>to double down on China — recorded a $24mn loss on its Chinese partnership <strong>HSBC Qianhai Securities </strong>last year, bringing its total losses since 2018 to $89mn.</p> <p>The bank's struggles on the mainland don't exactly help Quinn's case as he battles calls by Chinese insurer <strong>Ping An</strong>, HSBC's largest shareholder, for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26f32d30-84e8-4e3b-b211-eebff670d823\">historic break-up</a> of its Asian and western operations. </p> <p>It may be the only one left in the red last year, but HSBC's competitors still have a long road ahead in China themselves.</p> <p>The country's zero-Covid policy, coupled with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45d5fcac-3e6d-420a-ac78-4b439e24b5de\">western sanctions</a> on China and Beijing's severe crackdown on tech will make it difficult to keep up the meagre momentum they've achieved so far.</p> <h2>The activist shaking up one of France's oldest companies</h2> <p><strong>Bluebell Capital</strong>, the activist fund propelled into the limelight following its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd369552-8491-40a2-b83b-9a1b2e32407a\">dramatic ousting</a> of yoghurt maker <strong>Danone</strong>'s CEO last year, is once again knocking on the door of corporate France — this time with construction materials group <strong>Saint-Gobain </strong>in its sights. </p> <p>The move won't raise too many eyebrows. Saint-Gobain, a company with an illustrious history as a 17th-century supplier to the court of <strong>King</strong> <strong>Louis XIV</strong>, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf036e6e-7866-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d\">chronically underperformed</a> compared to its listed peers and has been scrutinised over its seemingly top-heavy structure for years.</p> <p>Bluebell's demands include replacing its combative longtime chair <strong>Pierre-André de Chalendar</strong>, a move that has already faced pushback, heralding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/643e9450-94de-488f-a208-e2b3e59f2810\">what could turn into a meatier governance tussle</a>, the FT's Sarah White reports.</p> <p>Bluebell, which has bought a stake worth less than 0.5 per cent in the company, is also calling for Saint-Gobain to take more radical action to reshape the industrial company and further capitalise on what should be a golden era for the renovations industry. Governments worldwide are pouring stimulus funds into building makeovers in the name of energy efficiency. </p> <p>It is suggesting that Saint-Gobain either spin off or list a distribution business, which it deems has few synergies with its core buildings materials units. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Moderna</strong>'s new chief financial officer <strong>Jorge Gomez </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64de3ef4-dd36-44d8-af3b-7635dee247fd?shareType=nongift\">has left the company</a> a day after joining the Covid-19 vaccine maker following his former employer's announcement that it had launched an investigation into financial reporting.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cleary Gottlieb </strong>hired tax partner<strong> Maureen Linch </strong>and intellectual property, technology transactions and privacy partner <strong>Marcela Robledo</strong> to its San Francisco Bay Area office. They join from <strong>Baker McKenzie </strong>and <strong>Morrison &amp; Foerster</strong>, respectively. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>After Abenomics </strong>SMBC Nikko was poised to become a champion under former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's sweeping governance reforms. Its swift <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4740387d-df96-4139-b12f-8456209a2dea\">fall from grace</a> has instead cast a shadow over Japan's entire financial services industry, the FT writes.</p> <p><strong>Pedalling uphill </strong>One management overhaul and hundreds of millions in losses later, Peloton <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9804583-2c59-4451-9236-d240be313b25\">is running out of cash to burn</a>, the FT reports.
