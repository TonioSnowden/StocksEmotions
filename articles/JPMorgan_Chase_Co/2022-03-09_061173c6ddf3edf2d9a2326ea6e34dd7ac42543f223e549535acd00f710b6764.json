  "title": "Chinese nickel giant in LME nickel market meltdown gets financial lifeline from banks to meet $8 billion losses",
  "text": "<p>At the center of the action is Chinese nickel titan Tsingshan Holding Group, the world's biggest producer of a metal used in stainless steel and&#xa0;electric-vehicle batteries. The company,&#xa0;sitting on $8 billion in trading losses, said Wednesday it had secured enough metal to settle all its loss-making positions, according to a state-run media outlet.</p><p>Tsingshan received a financial lifeline to help meet margin calls. It secured bridge loans from banks including&#xa0;JPMorgan Chase&#xa0;&amp; Co. JPM and&#xa0;China Construction Bank&#xa0;Corp.&#xa0;HK:939, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported that Tsingshan had obtained a loan package from domestic and international lenders. Tsingshan couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>The London Metal Exchange suspended the nickel market early Tuesday, the first time it had paused trading in a metal contract since the collapse of an international tin cartel in 1985. The decision followed&#xa0;a near doubling in prices over a few hours—a run-up traders said had no precedent.</p><p>The disorder has ramifications for miners, steelmakers and electric-vehicle makers because LME prices are used as a benchmark in the metals industry. Commodity markets were already in turmoil from&#xa0;the war in Ukraine&#xa0;and&#xa0;punishing sanctions, which have cut supply lines and stifled trading of metals, energy and food, essential to the running of the global economy.</p><p>“Clearly these are unprecedented times and they have called for us to take action we would not wish to have taken,” LME Chief Executive Matthew Chamberlain said. “We faced a choice between ensuring the overall and longer-term financial stability of the market, and the shorter-term trading profits of those participants who had traded on Tuesday morning.” In a statement, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said it was in close contact with the LME and other relevant parties.</p><p>In a sign Tsingshan's steps had soothed nerves in the nickel market, prices for some contracts on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell the maximum 17% Wednesday evening. Previously, some nickel contracts had been suspended for rising by the maximum amount.</p><p>An expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com.</p>",
