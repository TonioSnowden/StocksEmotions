  "title": "Credit Suisse Names New Chief Compliance Officer; Rafael Lopez Lorenzo, currently the bank's global head of group internal audit, will be the new chief compliance officer starting Oct. 1",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Lopez Lorenzo will take over the compliance post from Thomas Grotzer, who was appointed interim head of compliance in April after Lara Warner, the group's former top risk and compliance executive, stepped down after the bank's dealings with Archegos and Greensill unraveled.</p><p>Archegos, a family investment firm for former hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, rattled Wall Street when the large, concentrated positions it held in a few stocks went sour. Banks lost more than $10 billion exiting the trades. Credit Suisse fared the worst among Archegos's lending banks, with more than $5.5 billion in losses.</p><p>Greensill Capital, a U.K. finance firm that ran investment funds with Credit Suisse, filed for insolvency in March and left the bank on the hook for losses.</p><p>Credit Suisse said Mr. Lopez Lorenzo has a background in audit and banking and cited his deep understanding of the firm's processes and challenges through his leadership of the internal audit team.</p><p>Mr. Lopez Lorenzo, who joined Credit Suisse in 2015 from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., was part of the bank's review and advisory team through the finalization and publication of the Archegos report, an investigation the bank commissioned into the breakdown that led to massive losses from the family office, a company spokeswoman said. The bank's investigation into Greensill is still ongoing, she added.</p><p>The Archegos report, published in July, detailed how Credit Suisse for years granted Archegos special dispensation to avoid rules meant to protect the bank. The report also found that the bank ignored staff warnings before the family investment firm's collapse.</p><p>The latest appointment comes after Credit Suisse's new chairman, António Horta-Osório, promised a broad review of the bank's risk management practices and its strategy and culture.</p><p>The bank on Wednesday also announced the appointment of Christine Graeff as its new global head of human resources. Ms. Graeff, who joined the bank in January, has been the global head of communications and deputy global head of human resources. She will succeed Antoinette Poschung, who is retiring by the end of January 2022.</p><p>Cecilia Butini contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p><p>Credit Suisse Names New Chief Compliance Officer</p>",
