The hearing of the full committee is billed as the Annual Oversight of the Nation's Largest Banks.</p><p>Despite the glare of the spotlight on the bank CEOs, BTIG said that they will be listening for lawmaker and witness commentary regarding bank M&amp;A, the asset cap currently imposed on Wells Fargo, the state of the economy, and competition with nonbank challengers. BTIG does not expect any major policy changes or revelations from the hearings.</p><p>\"From our seat, these hearings remind us of the Nutcracker ballet as they are both seasonal, follow a relatively tight script, and are forgotten almost immediately after the lights dim to black,\" BTIG analyst Isaac Boltansky said in a note last week.</p><p>The seven bank CEOs scheduled to testify at both the House and Senate hearings are Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Citigroup Inc.'s C Jane Fraser, Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s WFC Charlie Scharf and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America Corp. BAC.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp USB CEO Andy Cecere, PNC Financial Services Group PNC CEO William Demchak and Truist Financial Corp.

Those measures address financial issues ranging from climate change risk to modernization of mergers and acquisitions to improving credit reporting for consumers.</p><p>With the U.S. Senate now divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, some banking measures have been slow to win passage of the full Congress. The dynamics are expected to shift in November with the midterm elections.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's vice chairman for supervision Michael Barr made his first policy speech on Sept. 7 and said the government could introduce more regulations for regional banks to shore up more capital during economic downturns, among other potential changes.</p><p>Also Read: New Fed banking chief Michael Barr lays out vision on digital currency and keeping banks safe</p><p>Jamie Dimon, Jane Fraser and other CEOs are heading to Capitol Hill this week for their annual grilling</p>",
