  "text": "<p>Stocks have slid in recent weeks as investors debated how aggressively the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to tame elevated inflation. Price pressures have eroded some corporate earnings, but money managers also worry that tightening financial conditions too much risks weighing on economic growth.</p><p>Inflation concerns were exacerbated in recent months as China implemented lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19, adding strain to supply chains. Russia's war against Ukraine has also caused European countries to shift away from Moscow's oil and gas, adding to prices.</p><p>\"This year, we're dealing with several issues, which in and of themselves would ordinarily be the top story in any given year,\" said Hugh Gimber, a global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Yet markets are having to deal with them all at the same time.\" This has lent to heightened volatility, he said.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.815% from 2.785% Friday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, added 1.2% to $113.95 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.9%. Shares of Danish pharmaceutical group Bavarian Nordic, which manufactures smallpox vaccines, added 5% in Copenhagen trading. Public-health officials say smallpox vaccines can protect against monkeypox, a viral disease that circulates mostly among rodents in parts of West and Central Africa. There has been a recent spate of monkeypox cases in humans around the globe.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performance. Japan's Nikkei 225 added 1%, while South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3%. China's Shanghai Composite was flat, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Edge Up After Nearing Bear Market</p>",
