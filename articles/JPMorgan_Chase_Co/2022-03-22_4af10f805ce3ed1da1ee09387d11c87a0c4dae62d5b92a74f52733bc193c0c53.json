  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Russian  Currency  Bond  Market  Reopens  ----  By Caitlin Ostroff",
  "text": "<p>   Investors sold Russian local-currency government bonds as trading reopened Monday after being shut for three weeks. </p><p>   Russia is starting to thaw trading freezes enacted after its invasion of Ukraine prompted Western sanctions targeting its central bank's foreign-currency reserves and the access of some of its banks to the Swift financial network. </p><p>   Closing markets forestalled an expected fire sale of Russian assets, investors say. </p><p>   Russia's central-bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said last week that the Moscow Exchange would reopen gradually, but provided no details beyond the bond buying. Russia's stock market remains closed. </p><p>   Ms. Nabiullina, recently nominated for a third term, said the central bank would purchase Russian government bonds to prevent excessive volatility and ensure smooth trading. </p><p>   A Russian local-currency bond maturing in March 2033 fell to 67.9% of its face value, also known as par, from about 87% ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Russia's central bank doubled interest rates at the outset of the war to 20%. When interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds, which pay a lower rate of interest, drop in value. Passive funds that track benchmark indexes to determine what they hold will be among those forced to sell. </p><p>   JPMorgan Chase Co. has said it would exclude Russian sovereign and corporate debt from all of its widely tracked fixed-income indexes, effective March 31. </p><p>   Russia averted defaulting on a dollar-denominated bond last week, but could default on a local-currency bond that was due for payment earlier this month but that foreign investors haven't received. Ratings company Fitch said if the Russian state doesn't pay holders of its local-currency bonds in the 30 days after it didn't forward payments to foreign bondholders on March 2, it would declare the country in default. </p><p></p>",
