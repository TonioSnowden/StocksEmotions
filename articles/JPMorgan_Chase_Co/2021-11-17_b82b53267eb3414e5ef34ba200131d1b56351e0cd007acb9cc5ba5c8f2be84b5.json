  "text": "<p>Inflation is here. <strong>UK inflation </strong>rose at its fastest pace in almost a decade last month, official figures showed this morning. The consumer prices index rose at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent in October, the Office for National Statistics said. While economists had been expecting a steep increase, the figure was higher than the 3.9 per cent they anticipated. </p> <p>The jump was driven by higher household energy bills after the price cap hike last month, and more expensive second hand car and fuel prices. Higher prices in restaurants and hotels contributed too. The ONS also pointed to high producer price inflation, with the cost of goods produced by factories and raw material prices at their highest rates for more than 10 years. </p> <p>The data will add to expectations for a rate rise from the Bank of England, which held fire last month. But the debate over whether price rises are transitory or here to stay rages on. Tell me what you think. Email me at&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>SSE</strong> announced plans to invest £12.5bn by 2026 “focused on net zero infrastructure”, £1bn more than it had previously announced, to be funded by sales in future of minority stakes in its UK electricity networks. But the energy group rejected calls for the break-up that activist <strong>Elliott</strong> had pressed for. SSE reckons it can deliver a quarter of the UK's offshore wind target and a fifth of the country's electricity networks investment. It announced the strategic update alongside half-year results, where slow wind speeds which hit the renewables business were more than offset by performance in its networks and gas storage businesses. </p> <p><strong>GSK </strong>and <strong>Vir Biotechnology</strong> announced $1bn in US government contracts for their Covid-19 treatment sotrovimab after trial data showed it reduced hospitalisation and risk of death by 79 per cent in adults with mild to moderate Covid at high risk of progressing to severe disease. </p> <p><strong>British Land</strong> is putting the pandemic behind it, with a 2.9 per cent increase in the value of its portfolio in the six months to September. Sales at its retail sites are back to 98 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. At <strong>Workspace</strong>, the flexible office provider, property valuations fell, but only by 0.7 per cent. It reported a small half-year pre-tax profit of £3.4m, up from last September's £110m loss.</p> <p>Some <strong>Barclays</strong> investors aren't very impressed with the £2.5m-plus exit package awarded to departing CEO <strong>Jes Staley</strong>. Staley resigned after a regulatory investigation into his ties to sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. The board is paying out his 12 month notice period, handing him £2.4m in fixed pay, £120,000 in pension allowance and repatriation costs to the US. The Investor Forum, a lobby group for large investment managers and pension funds, has received complaints from its members over how Staley's departure has been handled, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/654a345c-d0e6-4ff9-a5bd-5e740ad59fd0\">banking team report</a>. </p> <p>The hedge funds that took control of <strong>Debenhams</strong> before its collapse last year have received more than two-thirds of the £300m recovered by the chain's administrators while landlords, local authorities and suppliers are likely to face a wipeout, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c02899f-1d86-481f-9a31-63d10c4c71bc\">Jonathan Eley reports</a>. </p> <p>And the upset over watered-down <strong>audit reforms</strong> rumbles on, with ministers urged to rethink plans amid warnings that proposals risk further corporate scandals. Catch up on the fight <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd10df1-efd6-4261-b8ce-c8f189f3a3ef\">here</a>. </p> <p>Also out today are results from spreadbetter <strong>CMC Markets </strong>and software provider <strong>Sage. </strong></p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Netflix </strong>is beginning to regularly report viewership numbers for its top programmes and films in a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd4cbbfa-d2dd-4260-b84c-8d54ada53d05\"> strategy shift</a> for the streaming group. It is to report how many hours people spent watching its top 10 TV shows and movies, ending a period when it has closely guarded such data. But it won't reveal viewing figures for flops. </p> <p>Electric truckmaker <strong>Rivian</strong> is worth more (in market capitalisation terms) than Volkswagen, while electric carmaker <strong>Lucid</strong> is worth more than Ford. Some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0575122-404d-4d11-b54b-f1af77733a4e\">think that's frothy</a>, since Lucid made a $524m loss last quarter and Rivian has no meaningful revenues. </p> <p>And <strong>JPMorgan </strong>is in a legal tussle with <strong>Tesla</strong> linked to Elon Musk's notorious “funding secured” tweet. The Wall Street Bank claims the carmaker failed to make a required payment <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b49c3f4-890d-4c67-bda0-d0c8e71c3f69\">on a warrants deal</a>.
