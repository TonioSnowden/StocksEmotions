  "text": "<p>UK inflation hit a 41-year high in October, accelerating to 11.1 per cent on the back of rising energy and food prices.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said inflation was now at its highest level since October 1981, having recorded a rate of 10.1 per cent in September. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rate of 10.7 per cent for October. </p> <p>The high rise in prices in October presents a difficult backdrop for chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement on Thursday and suggests the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates further to bring inflation down to its 2 per cent target. The BoE is expected to increase rates by a further 50 basis points in December, from the current level of 3 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>In October, the sharp rise in the cost of living was caused by higher gas, electricity and food prices despite the government's energy guarantee. This capped bills for gas and electricity at an annual rate of £2,500 until April for a household with average usage of gas and electricity.</p> <p>Food price inflation rose sharply to 16.5 per cent in October, the highest for 45 years, according to the ONS.</p> <p>Grant Fitzner, chief ONS economist, said: “Over the past year, gas prices have climbed nearly 130 per cent while electricity has risen by around 66 per cent.” </p> <p>The one relatively bright spot in the figures was that core inflation, excluding food and energy, held steady at 6.5 per cent in October, the same rate as in September. Economists had been hoping, however, this measure would dip to 6.4 per cent in October. </p> <p>Prime minister Rishi Sunak said inflation was “the enemy that we need to face down”, adding he hoped to reduce it as soon as possible.</p> <p>Hunt blamed Russia's war in Ukraine for the deepening cost of living crisis, but pledged to take “tough but necessary decisions on tax and spending” in the Autumn Statement to help curb inflation. </p> <p>“We cannot have long-term, sustainable growth with high inflation,” he said. “Tomorrow, I will set out a plan to get debt falling, deliver stability and drive down inflation, while protecting the most vulnerable.”</p> <p>UK inflation was similar to many other G7 countries and was no longer the highest: Italy's rate hit 12.8 per cent in October. </p> <p>Andrew Bailey, BoE governor, said that with hindsight, the central bank had contributed to inflation by printing money and buying assets as part of efforts to support the economy during the Covid-19 crisis.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Quantitative easing did contribute [to inflation] because that's what it's designed to do, but it was not a very big contribution,” he added.</p> <p>Economists said UK inflation might have peaked and could fall in the months ahead, although they warned that any decline was likely to be slow. </p> <p>Yael Selfin, economist at KPMG, said annual price rises had probably hit a peak. </p> <p>“The combination of weaker growth and the waning impact of global supply shocks could lead to easing price pressures. Nevertheless, inflation could stay above the Bank of England's 2 per target until the middle of 2024,” she added. </p> <p>Mike Bell, market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the rise in inflation to top 11 per cent did not tally with the BoE's message this month that interest rates needed to rise only modestly further from the current level of 3 per cent to bring inflation down. </p> <p>“Until it is clear weaker activity is starting to weigh on wage demands, we believe the Bank of England will have to keep hiking. We see UK rates peaking at 4.5 per cent,” he added.</p><p>Source: Chris Giles in London 2022 'UK inflation accelerates to 41-year high of 11.1%' FT.com 16 November.
