  "text": "<p>   Some big U.S. employers have dropped workplace mask requirements as Covid-19 cases fall and vaccination rates rise. Staffers at other companies are wondering whether they can ditch masks, too. </p><p>   With Apple announcing plans last week to drop masking requirements at many U.S. stores and major employers like Amazon.com Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. recently relaxing certain employee mask guidelines, some workers are questioning the need for a measure long framed as a necessary inconvenience. </p><p>   Antonesia Taylor said she was ecstatic when the property-management office where she works in New York City sent a memo recently telling staffers they could stop masking on premises. </p><p>   \"I was completely over having to wear a mask every day. It's annoying,\" said the 32-year-old who, like her immediate colleagues, is fully vaccinated. \"You could see as people read it, everyone just started taking off their masks.\" </p><p>   Biden administration rules released last week state that unvaccinated workers at companies with 100 or more staffers must test negative for Covid-19 at least weekly and wear a mask in the workplace starting Jan. 4, though the rules were temporarily blocked this weekend. Federal guidelines for fully vaccinated people, updated last summer to account for the highly contagious Delta variant, still recommend mask-wearing in public indoor settings where virus transmission is high and for high-risk individuals. </p><p>   Face masks have been shown to significantly reduce transmission of Covid-19. But as companies require vaccinations -- both to comply with federal rules and to ease employees' safety concerns as they return to workplaces -- the license to shed masks is a relief, some workers say. </p><p>   \"It's exciting to go in and see everyone and be like, 'Oh my gosh, you don't have to wear masks anymore,' and things kind of feel sort of normal again,\" said Rae Abramson, 25, who lives in Austin, Texas, and works for a hospitality company that dropped its mask mandate for employees who don't interact with customers. </p><p>   \"A lot of people in my office are getting their boosters,\" Ms. Abramson said, adding that has helped her feel more comfortable unmasking. </p><p>   Amazon, which has about one million employees in the U.S., told warehouse staffers they could stop wearing masks if they are fully vaccinated starting Nov. 2 unless federal, state or local laws say otherwise. JPMorgan relaxed its masking rules for vaccinated employees in select U.S. locations with high vaccination rates, according to a memo sent to employees, but staffers still must wear masks in common areas. </p><p>   Both moves came after the companies had reinstated mask-wearing rules this summer during the Delta-driven surge of Covid-19. By mid-September, average nationwide case counts began declining from a peak exceeding 160,000 newly reported infections a day, Johns Hopkins University data show. </p><p>   A survey of 961 U.S. employers by consulting firm Willis Towers Watson in August found that four in five required masks, and three-quarters of those that did mandated them for all employees regardless of vaccination status. </p><p>   \"I expect that as community transmission rates decline and vaccination levels of employees rise, more employers will relax mask mandates,\" said Jeff Levin-Scherz, the firm's population health leader. </p><p>   Spencer Bagley, a 35-year-old math professor in Salt Lake City, says he's comfortable staying the course if it helps end the pandemic. \"The reason that cases are going down is because there is better adherence to the kinds of measures that suppress transmission,\" said Mr. Bagley, who is vaccinated. </p><p>   \"It's like, 'My car is slowing down -- hooray, I'm going to let my foot off the brake!' That's some wild logic to me. Let's keep doing the thing that's working.\" </p><p></p>",
