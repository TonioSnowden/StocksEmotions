  "text": "<p>Deutsche Bank has recorded its highest quarterly profit since 2014, thanks to a boom in bond trading, strong results in asset management and a clean exit from its exposure to the implosion of family office Archegos Capital.</p> <p>Germany's largest lender said on Wednesday it generated a net profit of €908m in the first three months of 2021, compared with a €43m loss in the same period a year earlier.</p> <p>Deutsche also lifted its full-year outlook for 2021, saying it expects revenue to be “essentially flat”, compared with previous guidance of a year-on-year drop. Shares in the lender were up more than 10 per cent to €11.27 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.</p> <p>The key driver of the performance was once again the investment bank, which reported a 32 per cent year-on-year jump in revenue to €3.1bn, and the group's asset management unit, where revenue increased 23 per cent to €637m. Both beat analysts' expectations.</p> <p>Bloomberg reported earlier that Deutsche had a €3.4bn exposure to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/26733295-ab2d-4e20-9345-355e28ba2e23\">Archegos</a>, which collapsed last month after its leveraged bets came unstuck. However, unlike many of its investment banking peers, whose collective losses from the debacle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c480d5c0-ccf7-41de-8f56-03686a4556b6\">exceeded $10bn</a>, the German bank said on Wednesday that it was able to unwind its position without taking any hits. </p> <p>Deutsche, whose prime brokerage division that services hedge funds had like others lent heavily to Archegos and accepted shares as a collateral, was able to sell the shares quickly. “In fact, we returned excess collateral to the client after the wind-down,” chief financial officer James von Moltke told journalists on a call, adding that the lender was “obviously pleased with the risk management outcome”.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the results, Deutsche disclosed it would miss its 2021 cost-cutting target by €400m as it has to pay more than expected into the EU's bank bailout funds and will have to shoulder a €70m payout to Germany's private banking deposit insurance scheme. The scheme, which is funded by all German banks in private ownership, suffered a hit of more than €3bn from the collapse of Greensill Bank. </p> <p>Between 2022 and 2024, Deutsche expects further Greensill-related hits of about €60m per year due to higher contributions to the domestic deposit insurance scheme. </p> <p>Years of heavy losses, falling market share and repeated boardroom battles led chief executive Christian Sewing in mid-2019 to embark on the group's most radical restructuring in two decades, involving shrinking the underperforming investment bank, drastically reducing the lender's balance sheet and cutting 18,000 jobs by 2022.</p> <p>While heavy restructuring costs caused €5.7bn of losses in 2019, the lender has now returned to profitability, having reported net income of €113m last year.</p> <p>“Our first quarter is further evidence that Deutsche Bank is on the right path in all four core businesses, and is building sustainable profitability,” Sewing said. </p> <p>The results beat analyst expectations by close to 60 per cent. Deutsche's return on tangible shareholder equity — a key benchmark for profitability — stood at 7.4 per cent in the first quarter and was close to its 8 per cent target for 2022.</p> <p>Von Moltke said that Deutsche is likely to miss its 2021 cost target of €18.5bn by €400m, because of “incremental and uncontrollable costs”.</p> <p>He confirmed Deutsche's 2022 cost target, which the bank increased by €300m to €16.7bn in December.</p> <p>Kian Abouhossein, an analyst with JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients that Deutsche reported “the cleanest set of results of any global [investment bank] in our coverage so far,” adding that the lender's “transformation [is] ahead of track”.</p> <p>Deutsche's private bank and corporate bank, which had earlier been touted by Sewing as divisions that could help wean the lender off fickle income from investment banking, both reported falling revenue. However, lower provisions for credit losses pushed up pre-tax profits at the two units. </p> <p>The German bank also said it was confident that the burden on the private and corporate bank from low interest rates will peter out this year and next. </p> <p>Deutsche's common equity tier 1 ratio — a key indicator of balance sheet strength — rose to 13.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets in the first quarter, up from 12.8 per cent a year ago. </p> <p>Andrew Coombs, a Citi analyst and longstanding Deutsche sceptic, called the first-quarter numbers “a very good set of results”.</p><p>Source: Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt 2021 'Deutsche Bank posts highest quarterly profit since 2014' FT.com 28 April.
