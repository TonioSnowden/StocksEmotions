However, the pandemic — alongside a growing emphasis on environmental, social and governance standards — has strengthened the case for reform.</p> <p>We report today on how rewards for bosses of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60b8ae10-d4ad-45a5-97ca-aec2a8bc1e7a\"> FTSE 100 companies</a> in the UK have fallen by more than a fifth since the start of the crisis, as investors have strived to make them take a fair share of the pandemic pain experienced by their workers and shareholders.&#xa0;</p> <p>Flashpoints in recent weeks include <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb08adae-f75d-4ae6-899a-ac5e59238f3d\">Foxtons</a>, where shareholders rebelled against a bonus for the UK estate agent's chief executive, despite £7m in government support for the company, an emergency cash-raising and a plunging share price.</p> <p>As we also report today, this mood is echoed in the US, where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50e73d21-3de5-4196-b124-7281ec7af828\">“say on pay”</a> votes have given opportunities for shareholders to chastise boardrooms for trying to loosen performance targets during the crisis. Investors last week blew up at a $230m deal for General Electric's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/131f52af-53c5-47d8-b915-767df8403bb5\">Larry Culp</a>, which was reformulated during the pandemic to make it easier for him to earn bonuses.&#xa0;</p> <p>So far this year, support for bonuses in the US is at its lowest level since 2011. Although the votes are only advisory, the damage can be serious, indicating “blood in the water”. “A bad say on pay vote is one of the clearest, initial warning signs that an activist is going to be knocking on your door because they have seen that shareholders are upset,” said one legal expert.</p> <p>As FT columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/323ce491-de86-43a0-9ef5-a087eef7af54\">Helen Thomas</a> points out, investors in this unprecedented pay season are seeking proper justification for bonus payouts, taking into account whether a company has needed government help to survive the pandemic and how it has treated staff and shareholders in the process.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Boards minded to tweak targets or benchmarks retrospectively to put now-unattainable payouts within reach should face resistance,” she argues. “Against the backdrop of the pandemic, egregious pay awards and flaccid board oversight jar more than ever. But let's hope investor activism on pay outlasts Covid-19.”</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Economists' estimates on the effect of the <strong>EU recovery fund</strong> — ahead of the bloc's own forecasts due on Wednesday — are becoming more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2289951b-2c22-483d-a5e9-6eb820c82217\">bullish</a>. The €800bn Next Generation EU fund, as it is formally known, together with member states' own spending plans, could boost eurozone GDP by 3.5 per cent, according to Morgan Stanley. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95a28a60-12b7-4110-a769-99cf1e0af767#post-35b6fda9-6fff-4e79-9dab-8fd69c49e8a4\">Investor confidence</a> in the economy has hit a three-year high, according to a new survey. <strong>Olli Rehn</strong> from the European Central Bank's governing council <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05a12645-ceb2-4cd5-938e-974b778e16e0\">told the FT</a> that the ECB should follow the US Federal Reserve by accepting an overshoot in its inflation target to make up for years of slow price growth. </p> <p><strong>Latin America</strong>, the region worst affected by the pandemic, is relying heavily on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/511d3cee-b388-4eb5-a667-e693349ad564\">vaccine shipments</a> from China as it battles a third wave of infections, according to FT analysis. LatAm governments have suffered badly from the shift of much of the region's vaccine manufacturing capacity to cheaper locations in Asia. </p> <p><strong>Russia</strong> has been hit by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7c17f5e-e7b2-45bb-97d7-d5b456fb2bec\">labour shortages</a> caused by a fall in migrant workers from Central Asia as pandemic border closures took affect. Their home countries have also been hit hard by the drop in remittances which typically form a large part of their GDP.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>US banks</strong> are much keener on summoning their employees <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">back to the office</a> compared with their European counterparts. Compare JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon's decision to cancel all Zoom meetings because he is “done with it” to Société Générale's Frédéric Oudéa's dismissal as outdated “the idea that winning is just about spending 22 hours during the day at the office”. FT management editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0dcaf74-9428-4f64-84f2-41b001e1e311\">Andrew Hill</a> says workers will eventually return because they miss their colleagues, not because they pine for the material perks of an office. </p> <p>Companies are supporting post-pandemic spending on <strong>executive education,</strong> according to a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/751da438-9bf9-4a31-a43d-714bd1499743\">FT survey</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e3cf7b8-f203-4568-a290-836eef41b515\">Andrew Hill</a>, in another column, says there are lessons to be learned from the way business education developed after the second world war. <em>Get the full picture in our latest </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/executive-education\"><em>annual report</em></a><em> on the sector, with directories of programme providers&#xa0;and&#xa0;open-enrolment courses for managers.</em></p> <p>The pandemic has proved to be a supreme opportunity for <strong>innovation</strong> in business models, says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c69a6e5-8bb3-4be0-9674-11f2c21976b7\">Serguei Netessine</a> from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The “innovate or perish” environment has led to new ways of delivering goods and services without the need for the usual costly research and development, she argues. However, the rise of completely new types of business needs careful attention from policymakers, says FT columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91ecc4b6-4baa-4b6f-b86b-15cecf0401fe\">Rana Foroohar</a>.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>Prices for <strong>iron ore</strong>, the steelmaking ingredient, leapt by more than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4c5d29b-51c2-4e8c-b87a-ad6cac924476\">10 per cent</a> in Asian trading today as prospects for global economic recovery, fuelled by demand in China, intensified. Steel production in China alone jumped 19 per cent in March. </p> <p>An index tracking the US's biggest <strong>trucking and logistics</strong> companies has risen more than 25 per cent since the start of the year, underlining the strength of the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6509b386-7b17-4928-aca0-8c4806ccb070\">bounceback</a>. “It's a good time to be moving things around. There's a lot of demand, but not a lot of supply,” said one financial executive.</p> <p><strong>Corporate debt</strong> levels have risen steeply as companies try to repair the pandemic damage to their balance sheets but, says capital markets reporter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c05049da-deac-4271-bf01-237b77e3bb8a\">Joe Rennison</a>, there is a growing debate about whether leverage — the traditional measure of indebtedness — is still the best benchmark of credit risk.</p> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>Boris Johnson has&#xa0;<a href=\"http://https//www.ft.com/content/95a28a60-12b7-4110-a769-99cf1e0af767?emailId=609957d50be313000409b689&amp;segmentId=2785c52b-1c00-edaa-29be-7452cf90b5a2#post-8352be10-a0d8-4a91-a18e-3d63e52c98a3\">set out the next steps for easing England's lockdown</a>, allowing people from different households to <strong>meet indoors</strong> for the first time since Christmas, including in pubs and restaurants.
