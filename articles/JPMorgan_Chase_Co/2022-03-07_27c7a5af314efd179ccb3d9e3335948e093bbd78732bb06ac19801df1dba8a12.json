  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19ce052e-9b88-460b-bf26-9d38450413b1\">Oil prices</a> surged again today after the US appeared to be considering a ban on imports of Russian crude, as Europe desperately seeks new sources of energy amid the threat of a potential recession.</p> <p>US energy editor Derek Brower <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2bc0bbe-f43e-4927-8bd8-94c48e4fcdfc\">looks at the current crisis</a> in the context of the great oil shocks of the past. The closest parallel is in 2008, he writes, when Russian troops were preparing to invade another former Soviet republic (Georgia), crude prices were soaring and western countries were pleading with Saudi Arabia to open the taps.</p> <p>The US oil price eventually hit an all-time high of nearly $150 a barrel, but — with the price of benchmark crude briefly topping $139 a barrel today — that record may not stay for long, he argues. </p> <p>Yesterday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said a ban on Russian oil was under “very active discussion” with European allies, resulting in the latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7db838e3-6dc0-45e1-83ba-c8ce1c5544a5\">price spiral</a>. This would be a serious escalation of the sanctions programme, with important implications for the world economy, especially in Europe.</p> <p>As one head of research puts it: “Oil's rally will accelerate inflation, rates will go much higher, financial conditions will tighten significantly, consumers will be squeezed and corporate activity will be jolted. Recessionary territory is on the horizon.” Oil intensive industries such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a4ef6b4-10dc-4da4-9200-8957acf35c63\">aviation</a> will also be hit hard.</p> <p>The White House had previously rejected the idea of an embargo, saying that it would limit global supply and raise prices for consumers. The FT's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a66d457-75e3-4928-bc3b-c0919fa1be5f\"> Lex column</a> says it would also require the west to cut back on consumption. </p> <p>A longer-term solution involves increased investment in renewables, nuclear and liquefied natural gas, but history shows it takes years to reduce demand for crude, Lex notes. The US in the meantime has even sat down with erstwhile foes in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913af3e8-1a6a-46d2-a108-48e1ef74514f\">Venezuela</a> as it seeks alternative suppliers.</p> <p>Some argue that unlike gas, on which the EU is heavily dependent, an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94b88df8-0f14-48ca-8de1-ec6f8ade3b37\">oil boycott</a> would be easier for Europe to bear, as well as hurting the Russian economy more, as Moscow's oil revenues are more significant than those from gas. </p> <p>Agreement may yet be too difficult to reach. This afternoon, Germany, which is dependent on Russia for imports of more than 55 per cent of its gas, half of its coal and 35 per cent of its oil, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94b12297-b7c7-4923-9d95-86f196e90503#post-bd403335-6480-4094-9606-25edde0a038a\">rejected the idea</a> of an embargo. UK prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94b12297-b7c7-4923-9d95-86f196e90503#post-b012f873-16d2-459a-abfa-d6e6d8655bc1\">Boris Johnson</a> separately conceded that western countries would have to move at different speeds, but denied there was a split with the US on the issue.</p> <p>In the meantime, Russian tankers carrying oil and gas are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5ce82db-8d15-4c78-a539-403a9cab9114\">criss-crossing the seas</a>, unsure whether their intended customers will accept their deliveries.</p> <p>The main difference between now and 2008, says Brower, is that the crisis comes against a bullish economic backdrop, rather than “the mother of all credit crises”.</p> <p>“We're continuing to underestimate the oil price that the world can cope with,” an executive at JPMorgan tells him. “If this is your first oil shock and you're already wincing at the petrol pump, brace yourself. The market thinks you can probably take more price pain.”</p> <p><em>For those wondering how to contribute to aid efforts for Ukraine, here's our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6ebd4d6-c13c-4543-afc1-efbdd12f5512\"><em>list of charities</em></a><em> and the fundraisers supporting them, from art and jewellery sales to supper clubs.</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>US shale producers Oasis and Whiting announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35652204-aff9-4c3b-82b2-fea7144b346a\">$6bn merger</a> as crude prices soar</p></li>  <li><p>Scientists have identified <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7c35c45-10c5-46a5-afa7-cc938e292081\">genetic factors behind severe Covid </a>symptoms</p></li>  <li><p>Poland proposed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94b12297-b7c7-4923-9d95-86f196e90503#post-28c15d0d-b9d2-440b-a236-01a63273f5dd\">$1.74bn fund</a> to help people fleeing Ukraine</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94b12297-b7c7-4923-9d95-86f196e90503\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Another of the most serious consequences of the commodities crisis is the impact on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/457ba29e-f29b-4677-b69e-a6e5b973cad6\"><strong>global food supply</strong></a>.

The situation has been made worse by substantially increasing barriers to trade with the country's important partners — put in place with Sunak's enthusiastic support, Wolf notes. The head of <strong>Caxton</strong>, one of world's oldest macro funds, said the government needed to borrow to improve its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96dc133d-0b84-4878-9462-554eb7e0ef91\">depressing growth outlook</a>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8873005.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>An <strong>EU summit</strong> this week was meant to discuss fiscal guidelines but is now likely to be dominated by the response to the Ukraine crisis.

It follows year-on-year growth of just 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>The proposed takeover of <strong>Oxford Instruments</strong> by UK precision equipment maker Spectris has become one of the first big deals in London <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/037aea72-9dcd-4ad8-8299-603e1c83ed05\">to collapse</a> because of market uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

One ceramics company says EU emissions targets could devastate the industry in Spain, Italy and Poland, as expensive gas and carbon prices drain money needed to decarbonise kilns.</p> <p>The expected decline in business travel after the pandemic is leading <strong>US airlines</strong> to redraw the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5de8f03a-82fa-41a2-928a-27606351c9b4\">flight map of America</a> and focus more on holiday destinations and popular cities.
