  "title": "Funding Worries Are Hitting Some Banks More Than Others; Earnings have revealed a divide between lenders on deposit pressures, though maybe not as much as the market thinks",
  "text": "<p>Investors are worried about deposits—a lot more for some banks than others.</p><p>On the one hand, there are the money-center banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Net interest income for those banks continues to rise, thanks not only to loan growth but also to an expanding spread between funding costs like deposits and the yield on assets like loans. A big advantage for those banks are their vast pools of deposits from consumers and businesses that are used for day-to-day banking. These tend to see the slowest pressure from rising interest rates, while accounts used for savings, investment or just to stash extra cash tend to reprice more quickly.</p><p>On the other hand, data points from elsewhere this earnings season have raised alarms with investors that many banks may be poised to see growing deposit-cost pressure.</p><p>For example, net interest margin at First Republic Bank, which focuses on private banking in wealthier parts of the U.S., declined quarter over quarter. The bank said on its Friday earnings call that it was providing attractive certificate-of-deposit and money-market accounts that will help it retain and attract clients—but that came at the expense of net-interest-margin pressure. Total deposits at First Republic did grow 4% quarter over quarter, even as they shrank at Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. And First Republic's loan growth was sufficient to still drive up overall net interest income sequentially.</p><p>But the market appears spooked: First Republic is down more than 12% since it reported earnings on Friday morning, with the stock rebounding some on Monday. That is a contrast to those three money-center banks, whose shares are each up more than 4% since Friday morning. S&amp;P 500 banks overall are about flat so far since then.</p><p>One thing investors seem to be watching are brokerage accounts. As rates rise, the concern is that more customers will put idle money sitting there to work in money-market funds or the market, a phenomenon known as cash sorting.</p><p>Charles Schwab on Monday reported a 10% drop in its bank deposits from the second quarter to third quarter—though its net interest margin still expanded sequentially fairly sharply, and net interest revenue still grew 15%. Yet its shares are down about 3% on the day.</p><p>Morgan Stanley's so-called sweep deposits were down 18% from the second to third quarter. That is an industry term for deposits that are pulled into banks from uninvested cash in brokerage accounts. The firm said at the same time that some of customers' investment money was going into accounts such as high-yield savings at the bank. Overall, deposits were down less than 3% sequentially. For Morgan Stanley, which typically is more reliant on non-deposit funding than money-center banks, even higher-cost savings deposits can be attractive. Yet Morgan Stanley shares are off by more than 2% since Friday morning.</p><p>So there are some offsets for banks reporting more aggressive movement in deposits. And ultimately, inventors shouldn't be too complacent about the biggest banks either. Rates' rapid rise has given some customers little time to react, but Bank of America said on Monday it expects to feel more reaction early next year. Plus, if deposits broadly keep declining and banks' loan books keep growing, more banks may eventually either have to pay up for funding or potentially sell securities at a loss.</p><p>Pain isn't felt evenly as the Federal Reserve keeps ratcheting up the pressure. But few will be able to escape it entirely.</p><p>Write to Telis Demos at Telis.Demos@wsj.com</p><p>Funding Worries Are Hitting Some Banks More Than Others</p>",
