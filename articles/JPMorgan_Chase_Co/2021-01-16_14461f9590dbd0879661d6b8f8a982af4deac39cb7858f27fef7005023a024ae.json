  "title": "U.S. News: Consumers Pulled Back In December",
  "text": "<p>Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC, said December retail sales were \"an absolute disaster.\" Still, he said that \"no matter how far we fall in the short run, the assumption in financial markets is that we'll recover once the pandemic ends.\"</p><p>Spending declined at online retailers, a category that includes companies such as Amazon.com Inc., bars and restaurants, and at electronics, groceries and department stores, as consumers cut back on both in-person and online shopping. Consumers spent more on home improvement, at health and personal-care stores, and on clothing and gasoline.</p><p>According to the National Retail Federation, holiday sales gained 8.3% compared with the year-earlier period, exceeding the trade group's estimate of a 3.6% to 5.2% increase.</p><p>Home-improvement and online retailers posted big gains, while sales at apparel chains and department stores -- which historically tend to do well during the season -- continued to decline. Holiday sales exclude restaurants, gasoline and auto sales, and measure the year-over-year gains in the combined November-December period.</p><p>Retailers have reported mixed sales results during the holiday season. Target Corp. this week said winter holiday sales rose solidly, with online and in-store purchases rising. Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Lands' End Inc. said they benefited as consumers turned to comfortable clothing during the pandemic.</p><p>Recent private-sector data suggested a mixed start to this year. NPD Group, which tracks retailers, said Thursday that sales at retailers focused on items such as apparel and personal-care products increased 27% in the week ended Jan. 9 -- the largest increase in that category since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s tracker of 30 million credit and debit cardholders recorded a 2.7% decline in spending from a year earlier in the week through Jan. 11.</p><p>Other readings point to a slowing U.S. economy this winter, as the upswing in Covid-19 cases prompted states such as California to impose new business restrictions and individuals to limit activities. Employers cut jobs in December for the first time since the spring, and job openings are down while claims for unemployment insurance are up. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment fell slightly at the start of the year, a University of Michigan survey of consumers showed Friday.</p><p>Manufacturing recently has been a bright spot. The Federal Reserve on Friday said industrial production increased solidly in December, with manufacturing output climbing nearly 1% and utility output increasing as heating demand picked up.</p><p>Many analysts are optimistic about consumer spending in the months ahead, in part due to the prospect of additional pandemic relief from the government. The personal-saving rate, the portion of after-tax income that consumers sock away, was 12.9% in November, according to the Commerce Department, well above the 7.5% rate a year earlier.</p><p>\"These are all positive drivers right now,\" said Craig Johnson, president of the retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners. They offer \"a small but still noticeable tailwind for consumer spending,\" he added.</p>",
