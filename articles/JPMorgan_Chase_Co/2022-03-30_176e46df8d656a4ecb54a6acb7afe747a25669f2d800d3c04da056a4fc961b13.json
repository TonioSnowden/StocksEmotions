  "title": "Las Vegas Tourists Are Fine With Higher Prices—for Now; Tourists roll with higher prices for food, hotels and shows on the Strip, a $32 strawberry daiquiri",
  "text": "<p>He is still selling about 1,000 hot dogs a day. \"We've had no complaints here,\" Mr. Gaughan said. \"That surprised me.\"</p><p>Typically, when consumers face higher grocery bills and gasoline prices they are less inclined to splurge on a flashy getaway. Las Vegas has long been a place to find bargains, freebies and upgrades enshrined in customer loyalty programs. But after two years of staying home because of the pandemic, tourists are heading to the Strip and paying more for travel, hotels, food and entertainment.</p><p>In February, inflation rose 7.9% compared with the same month a year earlier—the highest level in 40 years, according to the Labor Department. The rising inflation comes as casino operators are trying to make up for lost profits in the earlier months of the pandemic. The Strip also relies on visitors driving to Vegas from Southern California, where gasoline prices have reached some of the highest in the country. Broadly, gasoline prices were up 38% in February, the department said.</p><p>Still, Las Vegas weekends have been booming in recent months, even with higher hotel room rates. Gambling revenues on the Strip have also been soaring. Las Vegas Strip casinos reported an all-time high of $7 billion in gambling revenues last year, exceeding pre-pandemic numbers and breaking the previous record of $6.8 billion in 2007, according to state regulators. Many casino operators say they expect the travel demand to continue this year, even as visitors take note of the higher tab.</p><p>\"There is grousing, to be sure, over rising prices,\" said Michael Pollock, managing director of gambling consultant firm Spectrum Gaming Group. \"But does that grousing translate into a change in decision-making? I have not seen any evidence of that.\"</p><p>Anthony Curtis, publisher of the newsletter Las Vegas Advisor, has been monitoring prices for more than 40 years, and he says the increases are the highest he has seen. He uses a Top 10 list of the best deals as a barometer for the Vegas market, and four of those increased in the past two months. A popular $5.99 steak special, for example, bumped up to $6.99. One buffet went up by $2.</p><p>\"These are sacred deals that are going up in price all over the place,\" Mr. Curtis told his YouTube viewers this month.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Curtis predicted the price increases—combined with nightly resort fees added to hotel bills, paid parking and various other fees—will turn off travelers.</p><p>\"Eventually these customers who are spending like crazy are going to go back to normal,\" he said. \"They're not going to have that money to spend. They're going to get tired of the gouging…I think that Vegas is looking at a very difficult time coming pretty soon.\"</p><p>Las Vegas is anticipating even bigger crowds with the arrival of pool season. On the Venetian casino's pool deck, a 20-ounce strawberry daiquiri is now $32—or $35 in a souvenir cup—compared with $28 and $33, respectively, as recently as November, according to menus posted on the casino's website. A spokesperson for the Venetian declined to comment.</p><p>Hotel room rates have also rebounded since the Covid-19 pandemic's lows and in some cases, doubled or tripled on the weekends. For this Saturday night, the higher-end Strip properties were offering nightly rates between about $400 and more than $700 for the most basic rooms.</p><p>Overall, the average Strip hotel room rate was about $154 in January, up about 59% from the previous year at nearly $97, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. That is still slightly below the pre-pandemic average of $166 a night in January 2020, according to the tourism bureau.</p><p>Jeff Walker, a frequent visitor from Canada who hosts \"The Jeff Does Vegas Podcast\" discussing the city, said on his stay this month he noticed a price shift since his previous trip in December, including when he ordered a drink at a lobby bar on the Strip. \"I'm cheap,\" Mr. Walker said. \"I'm Canadian. I'm always looking for a deal. And the vodka and ginger ale that I was drinking was $15, which is insane to me.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>To what extent will higher prices cut into the Vegas experience? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In Las Vegas, show prices are going up, too. The average concert ticket price last year was more than $178, above an average of about $141 before the pandemic in 2019, when there were nearly three times as many shows, according to data from Pollstar. This year so far, the average price for a show is nearly $158, Pollstar said.</p><p>Jonathan Halkyard, MGM Resorts International chief financial officer, said at a J.P. Morgan investor event this month that the company's hotels have essentially sold out on the weekends for several months, driven by demand from leisure travelers. Group events and conventions are also returning, adding visitors midweek.</p><p>Mr. Halkyard said MGM and others on the Strip have been able to pass on higher costs to customers without dampening demand. \"We meet customers of all stripes and all travel purposes saying, 'I've waited two years to travel,'\" he added.</p><p>Jordan Blake, of Springfield, Mo., visited Las Vegas with his wife this month and didn't notice any price increases. They ate at several restaurants, attended a Vegas Golden Knights hockey game and went to the show \"Opium\" at the Cosmopolitan.</p><p>What they have noticed, he said, is fewer comps—offers for free room nights or spending credits. During the peak times of the pandemic, when casinos were desperate to get people back, the offers were more generous, he said.</p><p>\"So for very moderate, almost low-roller, gamblers like ourselves, we had never seen comps that good before, and we kind of got used to it,\" Mr. Blake said. \"Now that Vegas has gotten busy again, they've really crashed.\"</p><p>Even so, Mr. Blake said, they are planning their next trip in June.</p><p>Anne Steele contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Katherine Sayre at katherine.sayre@wsj.com</p><p>Las Vegas Tourists Are Fine With Higher Prices—for Now</p>",
