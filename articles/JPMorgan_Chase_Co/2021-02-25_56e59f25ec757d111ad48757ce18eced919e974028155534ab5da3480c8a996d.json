  "text": "<p>TIAA has tapped Thasunda Brown Duckett, one of the leaders of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e\">JPMorgan Chase</a>'s consumer bank, to become chief executive at the $1.3tn investment manager.</p> <p>Duckett, 47, one of the most prominent black executives on Wall Street, has most recently been chief executive of Chase consumer banking, with responsibility for its network of 4,900 branches, $600bn in deposits, 25m customers and 40,000 employees. In 16 years with the bank, she also ran its auto lending operations and worked in its mortgage division.&#xa0;</p> <p>She joins the asset management industry as pricing pressure, driven by the rise of low-cost passive investment, has led to tightening margins and accelerating consolidation among smaller players. She will replace <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc97d726-1716-4bab-8c9d-9569afe306b1\">Roger Ferguson</a>, who announced late last year that he would retire in May after 13 years in the post.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/fbbfe201-2b2d-3b77-b344-1d6f71f925e7\">TIAA</a> — once known as the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, with a century-long history dating back to its founding by the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie — has expanded from a focus on teacher retirement plans to become a diversified investment house.</p> <p>“I am extraordinarily grateful for the opportunity to lead a company that has helped millions of people retire with enough to live in dignity and excited about the opportunity to help TIAA chart its next 100 years,” Duckett said in a statement.</p> <p>Mike Mayo, bank analyst at Wells Fargo, called the appointment “another data point showing that JPMorgan is a CEO manufacturing machine” — referring to the fact that banks including Barclays, Standard Chartered and Wells have leaders who once worked under Jamie Dimon.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, said: “I'd like to congratulate Thasunda on her appointment to this important new role. She is an outstanding leader and role model, and we will miss her.”&#xa0;</p> <p>In addition to her executive roles at JPMorgan, Duckett was instrumental in the launch and development of Advancing Black Pathways, the bank's philanthropic effort promoting economic development in black communities.&#xa0;</p> <p>JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division, of which the community bank is a part, had more than $50bn in revenue and $8bn in net income in 2020. Gordon Smith, who heads the division, said that Duckett's successor would be named shortly, and that in the meantime the unit's leadership would report to him.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong in New York 2021 'TIAA picks JPMorgan's Duckett as new chief executive' FT.com 25 February.
