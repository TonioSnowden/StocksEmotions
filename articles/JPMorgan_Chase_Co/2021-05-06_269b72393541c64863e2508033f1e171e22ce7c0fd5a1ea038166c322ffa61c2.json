  "text": "<p>Société Générale is to allow staff to work from home up to three days a week once the coronavirus crisis is over, the latest sign of divergence over the future of the office between European and US banks.</p> <p>Frédéric Oudéa, the French lender's chief executive, told the Financial Times the new flexible working arrangements were “absolutely feasible without impacting our client relationships or our productivity”.</p> <p>While Dutch lender ING and Germany's Deutsche Bank have made similar pledges, some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dd2a0a9-19b5-4904-b624-d7bf613b2ef8\">Wall Street </a>chief executives have spoken out against coronavirus-induced homeworking arrangements. Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon has dismissed remote working as an “aberration”, while JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon is calling his staff back to the office from July.</p> <p>Oudéa said he did not share “the idea that winning is just about spending 22 hours during the day at the office”, rejecting the suggestion his bankers could lose out on business by working remotely.</p> <p>He added that allowing workers more time at home would help attract “young talents” who “don't see the world in the same way they did just two years ago”.</p> <p>However, Oudéa emphasised the need to find a balance given that people, particularly junior bankers, “don't want to spend five days a week at home, there is a lack of diversity. You might not come across your CEO in the lift, you are not part of something”.</p> <p>The new arrangements allow the bank's French staff to work two to three days a week from home but Oudéa said it would be “more limited for trading if there is any issue of operational risk”. </p> <p>The policy could also be extended overseas depending on local regulations and trade unions, as well as the state of the pandemic.</p> <p>Oudéa was speaking after SocGen'<em>s </em>equities trading business delivered its best performance since 2015, helping profits beat expectations in the first quarter. </p> <p>SocGen reported a net profit of €814m, up from a loss of €326m in the same period last year, when markets were convulsed by the outbreak of the pandemic. Revenues for the quarter were €6.2bn, roughly €1bn ahead of a year ago, and surpassing analysts' forecasts of €5.9bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The massive beat versus expectations was driven by revenues and provisions while costs are well contained,” said Flora Bocahut at Jefferies.</p> <p>SocGen slumped to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec272b30-18ae-45a8-8975-e694c5cd2fa7\">first annual loss</a> in decades in 2020 as the banking sector was hammered by the coronavirus crisis and low interest rates.&#xa0;The bank has been under particular pressure, however, as it tried to turn round its stuttering investment bank after heavy losses early last year. </p> <p>Oudéa, the longest serving head of a big European bank, has sought to steer SocGen through the crisis and attempt to reassure shareholders.</p> <p>The bank's core equity trading division generated revenues of €851m in the first quarter versus €9m in the same period last year.&#xa0;Analysts had expected €573m.</p> <p>The division was hit hard in 2020, as the pandemic forced companies to cancel dividend payments that were at the heart of some structured products the bank sold. It was overhauled as a result and Oudéa said the results this quarter showed the changes were working.</p> <p>SocGen is due to lay out a broader plan for its investment bank to investors&#xa0;on May 10.</p> <p>Revenues from fixed income and currency trading were modestly higher at €625m, up from €609m last year and ahead of expectations at €570m. That beat European rivals such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e4bd0b8-6b20-4fb7-965c-3d682146d85a\">BNP Paribas</a> and Barclays, but still lagged behind Wall Street banks.</p> <p>The bank's core equity tier one ratio — an important measure of balance sheet strength — was 13. 5 per cent. Like European peers, SocGen reduced provisions for bad loans, setting aside €276m in the first quarter, against analyst expectations of €716m. It also said its cost of risk would continue to fall.</p> <p>At its domestic retail business, revenues dropped 1.8 per cent in the quarter. SocGen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b400dfd-1506-4d00-8007-3e9dddca64bf\">said last year</a> it would merge its two domestic retail bank networks, closing 600 branches and cutting €450m in costs, as it looked to capitalise on changes in consumer behaviour wrought by the pandemic.</p><p>Source: David Keohane in Paris  2021 'SocGen to allow staff to work from home three days a week after crisis ' FT.com 6 May.
