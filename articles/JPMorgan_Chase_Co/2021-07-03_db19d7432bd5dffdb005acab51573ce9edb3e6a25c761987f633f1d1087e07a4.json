  "text": "<p>Suddenly possibilities are opening up for more-tailored interactions and better time management. Some meetings are best conducted in person. But for investment bankers, a return to meetings may also mean a return to old practices and protocols that have tended to keep women in a corner of the room.</p><p>Zoom is the great equalizer. Everyone's box is the same size. It doesn't matter if you are the CEO or the summer intern, your real estate is the same. A box with a name but no title became a tool of empowerment. Your name and face are consistently visible, making you more memorable, familiar and known. When you speak it is very hard for anyone to interrupt and it is also very hard to be ignored with your face staring back. You get invited to a lot of meetings that you wouldn't have attended if travel were involved. I have witnessed many women in investment banking, young women in particular, find their voices and project newfound confidence in this virtual square. Remember, this is an industry still dominated by men and the physical manifestations of assertiveness and power.</p><p>Over the course of my career I have pushed and shoved my way to the head of the conference table. Like many other women, for a long time I would choose a seat at the back of the room. I remember the gestures at me to move out of the way so others could get down to business. I remember what it was like at the far end of the table, so far from the client I had to flick my business card down the table in a desperate attempt to be acknowledged. Many times my business card remained stranded in the middle of the table at the conclusion of the meeting. Often these habits follow women as they climb the ranks.</p><p>As we debate returning to the office, women must reassert themselves in person. Zoom created a profound shift in the power dynamics of group interactions. In investment banking, a lot of perception of power comes from physical presence, \"boardroom gravitas\" -- or, frankly, \"traditional masculinity.\" Women must make sure their newfound digital voices translate into lasting change.</p><p>Women need to bring the \"power square\" mind-set with us when we walk back into the room. Grab a strategic seat at the table, not just any seat. Introduce yourself and put a business card in someone's hand before the meeting starts. If you're in the room, be prepared and expect to make a contribution. Don't shrink to the side or otherwise diminish yourself. Command the space around you and fill it with your expertise, life experience, personality, command of the facts, opinion and authority.</p><p>Many workers will continue to use Zoom in a world of \"hybrid\" work. My message to my sisters: Seize the moment and own your square. Make it your personal power place. Show up early; be on camera first; never hide behind the mute button or turn the camera off. As you strive to find the balance between remote and in-person interactions, make sure you understand all the benefits of tools like Zoom.</p><p>And let's not lose the potential for greater fairness, equality and inclusion that tools like Zoom give us. Because physical manifestations of power, traditionally masculine power, do not exist the same way in a digital world.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Nason is J.P.
