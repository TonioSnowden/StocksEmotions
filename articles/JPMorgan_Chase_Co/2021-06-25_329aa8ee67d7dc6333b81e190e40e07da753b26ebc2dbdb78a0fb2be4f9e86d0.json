  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start</strong>: Declan Kelly, an influential adviser to Fortune 500 executives, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77203615-503e-4f6d-8011-1dbf99286140\">has lost</a> his board seat at the campaign group Global Citizen and ceded some of his responsibilities as head of the strategy company Teneo after allegations of drunken misconduct at a fundraising concert.</p> <p><strong>And one other thing to start: BuzzFeed</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13d2013f-e872-4311-a4b8-cfeafedcc413\">agreed to go public</a> in a deal with blank cheque company <strong>890 Fifth Avenue Partners</strong> that it said gave it an implied valuation of $1.5bn.</p> <h2>Things were even crazier at Wirecard than we thought</h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac949729-6167-4b6c-ac3f-f0aa71aca193\">year ago today</a>, the German payments company <strong>Wirecard</strong> filed for insolvency.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mark the anniversary with this deep-dive from the FT's Olaf Storbeck, who has seen internal emails, chats and meeting minutes among other documents, and hundreds of hours of witness hearings by Germany's parliamentary inquiry commission into the scandal. His findings were astonishing, to say the least.&#xa0;</p> <p>We already knew that Wirecard's top ranks (one is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec986d0e-5d92-4e66-a595-0f8645f1aaf0\">in police custody</a> and another is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/511ecf86-ab40-486c-8f76-b8ebda4cc669\">on the run</a>), weren't afraid to play dirty. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/745e34a1-0ca7-432c-b062-950c20e41f03\">barrage of attacks</a> on the FT's Dan McCrum by the company's private investigators and hackers as he carried out his five-year investigation into the fraud made that clear enough.</p> <p>Olaf's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bb36e7-54dc-463a-a6d5-70fc38a11c81\">latest Big Read</a> reveals Wirecard to have also been chaotic, byzantine and often ineffective.&#xa0;</p> <p>Highlights include:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Short seller surveillance </strong>When an anonymous <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0706763a-dadf-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818\">short seller report</a> sent Wirecard shares tumbling in 2016, the company sent London-based investigations firm <strong>Kroll</strong> to find its authors' identities. One of them was <strong>Viceroy Research</strong> founder <strong>Fraser Perring</strong>, who later filed a complaint with Lincolnshire Police over alleged harassment.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Calling a police officer</strong> An employee at Wirecard's London-based law firm <strong>Jones Day</strong> informally approached a Lincolnshire police officer to discuss the complaint, after which one of its partners <strong>Sion Richards</strong> said in an email to Wirecard that the officer agreed to provide information on a “confidential basis”, to which chief executive <strong>Markus Braun</strong> replied: “Well done.”</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Jones Day told the FT that none of its employees engaged “in any inappropriate conduct vis-à-vis the Lincolnshire Police (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the provision of any financial benefits)” and declined to comment further. Lincolnshire Police did not respond to an FT request for comment.</em></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Alternative facts </strong>In 2018, chief product officer <strong>Susanne Steidl</strong> pushed back on a draft press release claiming new products launched by Wirecard would soon generate an additional €100m in revenue: “I don't want to be the party pooper but this simply seems to be too high by a factor of 10.” The release was published the next day.</p></li> </ul> <p>There's so much more from Olaf's reporting than we couldn't fit into this newsletter. Some parts were more amusing than shocking.</p> <p>Like when Dan contacted various Wirecard executives for the first time in October 2014, requesting to discuss “a story that I'm working on”. Jan Marsalek, Wirecard's chief operating officer, called him “a real nutcase”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Yes, he needs to tell us what he is smoking in the evening,” replied Manila-based <strong>Christopher Bauer</strong>, who ran one of Wirecard's partner firms that would prove to be fraudulent.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Credit Suisse and Sanjeev Gupta: changing tack</h2> <p><strong>Credit Suisse </strong>once <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/542e84a5-caed-4b8e-bcd7-63051ae65ce1\">wooed</a> <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>, the metals magnate whose <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> conglomerate is under investigation by the UK's <strong>Serious Fraud Office</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>It handed him everything from a mortgage on a trophy mansion to a private audience with its then-chief executive<strong> Tidjane Thiam </strong>as it financed his business empire.&#xa0;</p> <p>But when Gupta's main lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\"><strong>Greensill Capital</strong></a> collapsed in a financial and political scandal in March, leaving GFG teetering, the bank seemed to reverse course.&#xa0;</p> <p>With $1.2bn in exposure to Gupta's empire, Credit Suisse hit his companies with winding-up petitions in London's courts and hired private investigators at Kroll to trace his assets around the world.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now the Swiss bank is changing tack again.</p> <p>Gupta has won a three-month reprieve from attempts to shut down his companies in court, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Sylvia Pfeifer, Jim Pickard and Owen Walker <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/ec73d03c-51ac-4b59-bcd0-bd54ef22a501?\">report</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The bank has also agreed not to take action in winding-up proceedings against Gupta's Australian businesses for six weeks.</p> <p>“There are more constructive, consensual conversations going on” between Gupta's group and its creditors, a person familiar with the situation said.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a crucial bit of breathing space for the tycoon, giving him a chance to try to refinance his UK steel assets.</p> <p>For Credit Suisse, the stakes are high. The clients affected — ranging from hundreds of prized ultra-wealthy individuals to pension funds and listed companies — are furious about their exposure.</p> <p>And tackling the fallout from its involvement with Gupta and Greensill is a priority for its new chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6140672-bc98-4c38-913c-75af869803c3\"><strong>António Horta-Osório</strong></a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>For the moment at least, Credit Suisse seems to have decided that working with Gupta is the best way to get its money back.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Eccentric tech tycoon John McAfee dies aged 75</h2> <p>“Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes,” cyber security magnate <strong>John McAfee</strong> said during his 2016 presidential run.&#xa0;</p> <p>But to the self-described “lover of women, adventure and mystery”, it wasn't just a campaign slogan.</p> <p>It was a creed he lived by from his beginnings as a Silicon Valley pioneer in the 1980s until his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11a1b203-6698-4d03-9295-d391ba15ffe3\">death</a> in a Spanish prison cell on Wednesday, the result of an apparent suicide.</p> <p>McAfee's death came hours after a Spanish high court approved an extradition request from the US where the tech entrepreneur faced tax evasion charges. His fleeing America in his yacht would be the last of several high-profile flights from authority.&#xa0;</p> <p>McAfee made his name from his eponymous antivirus software, which he sold in 1994 for $100m, a fortune that nearly disappeared during the financial crisis.</p> <p>He reinvented himself countless times, as a libertarian politician, cryptocurrency hype man and a playboy provocateur holding court over his Belize “party palace”, while dodging repeated brushes with the law.</p> <p>Though he reportedly conducted press interviews with a loaded gun in each hand to feel “comfortable”, a flurry of cameras followed him right up until his 2020 arrest in Spain.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p>Former UK chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99ea2488-fe1d-407f-9dda-a537d7471d65\"><strong>George Osborne</strong></a> has been appointed the next chair of the trustees of the<strong> British Museum</strong>. Osborne, an M&amp;A banker at Robey Warshaw, will take over in October from<strong> Sir Richard Lambert</strong>, former editor of the FT and ex-director of the CBI business lobby group.</p> <p><strong>Reliance Industries </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9893c252-4535-4420-8f63-d79ab4d3830b\">hired </a><strong>Yasir al-Rumayyan</strong>, head of Saudi Arabia's <strong>Public Investment Fund</strong>, as an independent director on its board.</p> <p>Under new chair <strong>Lina Khan</strong>, the US <strong>Federal Trade Commission </strong>appointed three key staffers, The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-ftc-chair-lina-khan-appoints-antitrust-chief-other-key-staffers\">reports</a>.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> has hired<strong> Tobias Åkermark</strong> as head of Nordic banking and country chief executive of Sweden, subject to regulatory approval. He previously worked as a managing director covering the Nordic region at <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Without a trace</strong> Nearly 16,000 positive Covid cases disappeared from the UK's contact tracing system, a mystery that would send the FT's Tim Harford down a rabbit hole of accountancy, epidemiology and Microsoft Excel that left even Bill Gates scratching his head. (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18db20d8-7726-43e2-87f1-c5861ad3dff5\">FT</a>)</p> <p><strong>Spac secrets</strong> Billionaires are coming up with increasingly imaginative — and perfectly legal — manoeuvres to get rich quick as the Securities and Exchange Commission struggles to get a grip on the boisterous blank-cheque market. (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-23/spac-stocks-wall-street-billionaires-make-millions-while-investors-lose-money?srnd=premium&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">BBG</a>)</p> <p><strong>Front and centre </strong>As US officials scrambled to mitigate last year's market meltdown, they had one adviser on speed dial: BlackRock's Larry Fink. The world's largest asset manager played a much larger role in the government's response to the economic crisis than previously known.
