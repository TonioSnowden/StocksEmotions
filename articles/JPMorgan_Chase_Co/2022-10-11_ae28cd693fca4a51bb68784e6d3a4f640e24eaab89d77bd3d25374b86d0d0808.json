  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon predicted the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9d90465-1036-430d-8f54-21d075a7b3ec\">American economy will tip into a recession</a> next year, warning the downturn threatened to spark “panic” in credit markets and wipe an additional 20 per cent from the value of US stocks.</p> <p>The comments from Dimon, whose economic pronouncements are closely followed by investors, followed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/276c1364-c312-4ad8-8b76-31f4d25dfa5f\">similar remarks </a>last month by billionaire investor Ken Griffin and point to a growing consensus among senior figures on Wall Street about the likelihood of a US recession.</p> <p>In an interview with CNBC on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Jamie_Dimon\">Dimon</a> listed rising interest rates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine as factors stoking the risk of a downturn in 2023.</p> <p>“These are very, very serious things, which I think are likely to push the US and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the US in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,” Dimon said.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
