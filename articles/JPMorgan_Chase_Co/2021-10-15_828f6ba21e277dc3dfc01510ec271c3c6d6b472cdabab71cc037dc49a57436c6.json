  "title": "Goldman Sachs's Petershill, a Collection of Private-Equity Stakes, Slides After IPO; Petershill Partners is down 9% since its lackluster debut in London last month",
  "text": "<p>The IPO—stage-managed in part by Goldman's investment bankers, alongside Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.—didn't see the first-day pop that investors have come to expect.</p><p>After hovering around the listing price of 350 pence for its first few days, its shares slid. They closed Friday at 306.50 pence.</p><p>Petershill, founded in 2007 as a unit of Goldman, belongs to a growing group of Wall Street firms that make money by feeding on Wall Street itself.</p><p>owns stakes in 19 private-equity and hedge-fund firms including Francisco Partners, Caxton Associates LP and Pelham Capital Ltd. It takes a slice of their investment profits and the management fees the firms charge.</p><p>Companies like Petershill, and competing funds managed by Blue Owl Capital Inc. and Blackstone Inc., provide tidy ways for investors to own a piece of the private-equity market. And they offer aging fund managers a way to free up net worth tied up in their firms by selling a stake.</p><p>Money has poured into the space, leading to some notable transactions.</p><p>Blue Owl was formed in May by the three-way merger of two private investment managers, Owl Rock Capital Partners LP and Dyal Capital Partners, and a listed blank-check company.</p><p>Goldman seized on similar investor interest but took a simpler path for Petershill, floating one-quarter of a new entity's shares in a traditional IPO in London, where the firm is based. The company raised 1.2 billion pounds, equivalent to $1.64 billion.</p><p>It made its debut into a volatile stretch in the stock market as investors worry about slowing growth and stickier-than-expected inflation and oil prices surge.</p><p>Still, its shares have performed worse than those of its closest competitors, an admittedly small set.</p><p>Blue Owl stock has fallen less than 1% since Sept. 28, while Blackstone's shares are up about 4.1%. Bridgepoint Group PLC, a London-listed private-equity firm, is down 6.2% over that period.</p><p>David McCann, an analyst at Numis Securities Ltd., said he believes Petershill's offering was priced fairly. He attributed the lackluster IPO in part to speculative investors who might have deserted the stock after failing to get the first-day bounce.</p><p>Mr. McCann also cited Petershill's opacity about what exactly it owns. The company hasn't disclosed exactly how much it owns of each firm in its portfolio or the fees it receives from each.</p><p>A spokesman for Petershill said that its business is balanced and that the company gives investors enough information to model its earnings. He said there was demand from investors for more shares than the company offered in the IPO.</p><p>One investor who decided not to buy shares told The Wall Street Journal he worried the relatively small percentage of Petershill stock that Goldman floated would make it hard to sell if the private-equity market foundered.</p><p>That concern, he said, was compounded by the fact that Petershill invests in funds whose assets, such as private companies and other unlisted securities, are even more illiquid.</p><p>Andrew Lister, head of closed-end fund strategies at abrdn PLC, bought shares in the IPO and has held on to most of them, he said Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Lister said Petershill's portfolio of stakes protects against the risks of investing in a single manager. He said he also likes that Petershill backs smaller asset managers that have more room to grow. The average firm in its portfolio has about $10 billion of assets.</p><p>\"We think it's a very attractive long-term story,\" he said of Petershill. \"Private markets continue to grow.\"</p><p>Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com</p><p>Goldman Sachs's Petershill, a Collection of Private-Equity Stakes, Slides After IPO</p>",
