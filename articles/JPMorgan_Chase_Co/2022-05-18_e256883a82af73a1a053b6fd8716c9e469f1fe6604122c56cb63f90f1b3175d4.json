  "title": "Goldman Eases Employee Vacation Rules --- Hard-charging bank lifts time-off cap for partners and managing directors",
  "text": "<p>More generous vacation paid time off is an especially important benefit at companies that have less-flexible work schedules and modalities, insurance and benefits, provider MetLife Inc. found. Many of these firms have pushed workers back into the office more often and are looking for other ways to match some of the flexibility seen across other industries, according to human-resource managers.</p><p>Once reserved for only a handful of technology companies like Netflix Inc. and Twitter Inc., unlimited paid time off has been adopted more broadly in the tight labor market, according to a survey from employee benefits adviser Mercer. Companies that have adopted the policy say the benefit can minimize burnout and instill a sense of trust among workers.</p><p>\"It's that blurring of time off and work,\" said Rich Fuerstenberg, a senior partner in Mercer's health and benefits practice. \"You get to a point, as an employer -- why am I going to even try to figure out when you're working, when you're not? Just call it unlimited. Work it out with your manager.\"</p><p>In addition to making time management easier, companies without set vacation time don't need to pay out accrued time off or deal with workers rushing to use vacation days by a certain date.</p><p>The policies are popular among employees, who often cite unlimited paid time off policies as benefits on company-ratings website Glassdoor. Even so, the record of workers actually taking more days off has been mixed.</p><p>For Goldman, the decision marks the latest in a string of moves it has made to adjust to the banking, trading and deals environment since 2020.</p><p>Goldman was one of the more aggressive banks about returning to in-person work and had largely full offices in January. Meanwhile, its business has been booming. Firms like Goldman have raced to bring workers back into the office and hire new ones to keep up with the flood of deals and frenzied markets.</p><p>Banks have more recently paid more to keep these workers. Goldman paid an additional $4.4 billion in compensation in 2021. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. each spent billions more in compensation as well.</p><p>In November, Goldman announced paid leave for pregnancy loss, an expansion to the amount of time employees can take for bereavement leave and the introduction of an unpaid sabbatical for longtime employees.</p><p>Goldman said its decision was designed to further support rest and recharge for workers.</p><p>\"As a firm, we are committed to providing our people with differentiated benefits and offerings to support well-being and resilience,\" Goldman said in the email announcing the new paid-time-off policy, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg News.</p><p>Goldman has about 400 partners and thousands of managing directors. It has more than 45,000 total employees.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
