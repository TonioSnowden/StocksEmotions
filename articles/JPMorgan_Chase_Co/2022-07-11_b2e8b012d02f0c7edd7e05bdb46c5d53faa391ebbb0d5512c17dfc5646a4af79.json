  "title": "U.S. Stocks End Lower Ahead of Inflation Data, Earnings Season; Twitter shares drop after Elon Musk sought to pull out of his takeover deal",
  "text": "<p>Stocks had lately staged a recovery, with the S&amp;P 500 rising nearly 2% last week. The rally cooled on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report showed the labor market is still hot, raising the probability that the Federal Reserve could continue with aggressive interest rate increases and potentially cause a recession. The next key data release, the U.S. consumer-price index for June, is on Wednesday.</p><p>\"The market's fear is that the Federal Reserve has to keep pushing and cause a deeper recession,\" said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \"I think you're already seeing inflation measures roll over, which I think is good news—that if we can alleviate these recession fears, we'll eventually push the market higher.\"</p><p>Investors also are awaiting corporate earnings reports for indications of how much higher prices and weaker consumer sentiment have eroded companies' profits. Americans expect lower inflation increases over the longer run, a new Federal Reserve Bank of New York report said.</p><p>\"We're in a backdrop where central banks are going to continue raising interest rates and the underlying market narrative continues to be one of potentially rising recession risks. We're going to see markets react to different data points, react to earnings,\" said Laura Cooper, a macro strategist at BlackRock, who said she doesn't advise that investors \"buy the dip\" at present. \"That sets us up for quite a volatile period ahead.\"</p><p>John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, said his firm, which shifted its holdings toward value stocks late last year, will revisit its investments toward the end of this month.</p><p>\"I don't think there's an appreciation that if we have a mild, self-fulfilling recession in the first half of this year, we still are going to have an 8% print on inflation, and the Fed's going to have to keep raising\" rates, he said.</p><p>Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, followed by BlackRock, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell about 0.9% on Monday.</p><p>Many household-name firms are also set to post earnings this week, including PepsiCo on Tuesday and Delta Air Lines on Wednesday.</p><p>\"These are going to be huge bellwethers on consumer confidence, on spending. The guidance will be really important—these guys have incredible insight about how the consumer is behaving and how they expect this to evolve over the rest of the year,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros.</p><p>Twitter slid $4.20, or 11%, to $32.65. Elon Musk filed a statement on Friday evening saying he was terminating his $44 billion bid for the social-media company and that Twitter had violated the merger agreement. Twitter also put out a statement indicating it would sue Mr. Musk.</p><p>Other tech stocks fell, with Facebook parent Meta Platforms finishing down 4.7% and Netflix off 5.2%. Shares of Broadcom declined $15.83, or 3.2%, to $482.86 after the microchip company announced that the president of its software business was departing.</p><p>Bond markets continued to flash a warning sign. The U.S. yield curve remained inverted, with yields on shorter-dated bonds above those of longer-dated debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.990% from 3.098% on Friday. The two-year Treasury yield dipped to 3.068%. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>Oil prices extended their decline. Brent, the global benchmark for crude, retreated less than 0.1% to settle at $107.10 a barrel. It fell more than 4% last week.</p><p>It is about \"the concern that we are going to see a sharp decline in demand on the back of the deteriorating growth backdrop,\" said Ms. Cooper, of BlackRock. \"That's notably playing out in the commodity space.\"</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 finished Monday down 0.5%, while the euro remained near parity with the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Most major Asian benchmarks declined. Chinese stocks dropped after Shanghai on Sunday reported its first local case of the BA.5 Omicron subvariant, and the country recorded more than 2,300 locally transmitted Covid-19 cases nationwide over the past seven days. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.8%.</p><p>Officials in Macau set a weeklong shutdown of casinos and other businesses to combat the surge in cases, sending gambling stocks downward.</p><p>Meanwhile, Beijing over the weekend fined some of the country's largest internet companies for failing to make proper antitrust declarations, weighing on tech stocks. Shares of Chinese electric-car maker NIO fell after the company said it formed a committee to look into a short-seller's claims that it had overstated its revenue.</p><p>In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index rose 1.1% on Monday after currentPrime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling coalition won the majority of parliamentary seats in an election on Sunday. The Japanese yen dropped to a 24-year low of more than 137 against the dollar.</p><p>—Michelle Chan contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com, Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com and Pia Singh at Pia.Singh@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks End Lower Ahead of Inflation Data, Earnings Season</p>",
