  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite index closed in correction territory for the first time since last March after a volatile day of trading that saw repeated swings back and forth across US stock markets.</p> <p>The tech-heavy index rose as much as 1 per cent earlier on Wednesday, but ended the day 1.1 per cent lower. The decline brought the Nasdaq more than 10 per cent below the all-time high set in November, meeting the common definition of a market correction.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 also swung between gains and losses before settling down 1 per cent. The benchmark index has fallen more than 5 per cent from the high it hit in early January.</p> <p>Stock markets, particularly tech stocks, have been volatile since the start of the year as investors prepare for the US Federal Reserve to rein in the ultra-loose monetary policy that has boosted markets since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>“Investors are now really muddling through a period of speculation about how aggressively central banks are going to move,” said Madison Faller, global market strategist at JPMorgan's private banking unit.</p> <p>“Everything is focused on the uncertainty around the removal of policy support,” Faller added. </p> <p>High-growth tech companies are seen as particularly vulnerable to higher interest rates because they reduce the value investors place on their potential future earnings.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/e5533208-e5cc-4be5-aea1-c464a9a205e3\">Fed</a>, which holds its monthly meeting next week, has already started reducing its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds, which had helped pin down borrowing costs since March 2020.</p> <p>It is also expected to raise interest rates several times this year and start shrinking its $9tn balance sheet.</p> <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which falls when prices rise, dipped 0.04 percentage points on Wednesday, to 1.84 per cent. It is still well above the 1.51 per cent level at which it started the year.</p> <p>“There are a lot of unknowns ahead about [the Fed's] quantitative tightening,” said Jeremy Gatto, cross-asset fund manager at Unigestion. This, he said, was causing “choppy moves”, with markets likely to switch between conflicting outlooks for monetary conditions and economic growth until the Fed updates on its plans next week.</p> <p>In European debt markets, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd81b2e6-652b-4c0e-ba17-ed2679c34762\">yield on the 10-year German Bund</a>, a benchmark for eurozone borrowing costs, slipped back below zero after briefly moving into positive territory for the first time in nearly three years. By mid-afternoon it was 0.01 percentage points higher for the day, at minus 0.02 per cent. </p> <p>“The move up in German rates is an indirect effect of what is happening in the US because these markets are connected,” said Ewout van Schaick, head of multi-asset at European fund manager NN Investment Partners. </p> <p>The yield on the 10-year UK gilt rose 0.04 percentage points to 1.25 per cent — around its highest in three years — after data showed inflation in the country had hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9188e191-4c1c-4968-a3af-9a43f086de6b\">30-year high</a>.</p> <p>The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 stock index inched up 0.1 per cent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng share index added 0.1 per cent and mainland China's CSI 300 lost 0.7 per cent. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo ended the session 2.8 per cent lower.</p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six others, dipped 0.2 per cent.</p> <p>Brent crude, the oil benchmark, rose 1.1 per cent to $88.44 a barrel — close to its highest price since 2014 — following an explosion on Tuesday night that temporarily halted exports on a Turkish pipeline and spooked a crude market already concerned about potential supply disruptions.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Tom Wilson in London</em><br></p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2022 'Nasdaq closes in correction territory after 10% drop in 2 months' FT.com 19 January.
