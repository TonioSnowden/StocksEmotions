JPMorgan's capital requirements are going to rise in coming months, not because of risk but because of rules that have yet to be adjusted.</p><p>\"This is bad for America, as it handicaps regulated banks at precisely the wrong time, causing them to be capital constrained and reduce growth in areas like lending, as the country enters difficult economic conditions,\" Dimon said.</p><p>On the subject of recession prospects, Dimon mostly reiterated his thoughts from May when he predicted an economic hurricane but said he wasn't sure if it would be a blockbuster storm or a more minor downturn.</p><p>\"While these storm clouds build on the horizon, even the best and brightest economists are split as to whether these could evolve into a major economic storm or something much less severe,\" Dimon said. \"Regardless, JPMorgan Chase is prepared for even the worst outcome.\"</p><p>Dimon's testimony includes descriptions of the bank's work on PPP loans, services for customers and small business, efforts to boost diversification in its loans and its work force, and how the bank remains accountable to its shareholders.</p><p>Also Read: Can an effort to revamp anti-redlining lending laws survive the swamp?</p><p>JP Morgan shares have fallen 26% in the year to date, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF has fallen 16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has lost 15%.</p><p>Jamie Dimon to criticize bank capital requirements and lament impact of inflation on regular Americans in coming Capitol Hill testimony</p>",
