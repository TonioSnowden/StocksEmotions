  "text": "<p>Another day, another raft of companies referencing labour shortages and supply chain disruption. But despite the well-publicised pressures, a number of businesses reporting this morning said they were overcoming the issues. </p> <p>Retailer <strong>Dunelm</strong> said that it had good stock levels and a low proportion of “seasonal” ranges which might be affected by supply chain disruption. It reported sales for the quarter to late September up 8 per cent year-on-year — or almost 50 per cent compared to two years ago. </p> <p><strong>Domino's Pizza</strong> reported quarterly sales up 10 per cent on the same period last year. It said that while it had seen “some impact” from inflationary pressures and a “challenging” labour market, it expected to sustain its “growth momentum”. </p> <p>And transport group <strong>National Express </strong>said that it had fully hedged fuel costs through 2022 and into 2023, and had agreed wage settlements across its business meaning it had experienced “no material impact from input cost inflation”. Its third-quarter sales have recovered to 83 per cent of their 2019 levels. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Defence contractor <strong>Qinetiq</strong> is not so lucky. It warned this morning that it was “experiencing technical and supply chain issues on a large complex programme, which, if unmitigated, could result in the need for a one-off write down to our short-term guidance”. It is trying to keep the hit to below £15m. </p> <p>Business at recruiter <strong>Hays</strong> is unsurprisingly booming meanwhile, with like-for-like fees up 41 per cent year-on-year for the three months to the end of September. Fees are back up to the levels of two years ago, before the pandemic. </p> <p>Private rental provider <strong>Grainger</strong> also reports a booming market, with 94 per cent occupancy. It reported an “exceptional lettings performance” towards the end of its second half, which ended last month. </p> <p>Also out today are updates from asset managers <strong>Polar Capital </strong>and <strong>Ashmore</strong>, while <strong>Legal &amp; General Capital</strong> has an investor day. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> is in trouble with investors suing the bank over the collapse of its <strong>Greensill</strong>-linked supply chain finance funds. The Swiss bank is offering refunds on fees from brokerage, discretionary mandate and banking services, as well as investment advice. But not for those who have started legal proceedings against the lender — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0142c617-9679-49ea-adf8-6920998ac1e5\">unless they drop their claims</a>, according to a person briefed on the offer. </p> <p><strong>Tech employees </strong>and investors have secured a windfall of more than $500bn from US public listings and sales since the start of this year. The total proceeds are already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b88de372-3066-43df-87f4-d98c6745a568\">twice as high</a> as last year's figure, according to data from PitchBook. Good news for the venture capital community.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan </strong>kicked off US bank earnings season yesterday, with a big jump in profits driven by the dealmaking boom. But it warned that expenses would continue to rise and that demand for new loans remained sluggish. US Banking Editor Joshua Franklin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5fa2ba2-1fdf-4a55-a500-fdb0e7cba8e6\">has the full story</a>.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Earlier this week a Bloomberg report suggested that <strong>private equity</strong> might be sniffing around <strong>GSK's</strong> consumer health business, which is due to be demerged next year. But here's my take on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95ba1ca6-935f-4a15-80a6-fe2542744535\">why GSK investors</a> may want to pass on private equity money. </p> <p><em>Yesterday we incorrectly suggested that WPP was a part owner of Sard Verbinnen &amp; Co before it was taken over by Finsbury Glover Hering. WPP will become the majority owner of the combined group.</em></p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Clutch of companies brush off supply shortages' FT.com 14 October.
