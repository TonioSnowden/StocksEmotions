  "text": "<p>Democrats in swing states and vulnerable districts in this year's pivotal midterms are distancing themselves from President Biden on social media as his poll numbers hit their lowest point...</p><p>Swing-state Senate candidates like Abby Finkenauer in Iowa, Val Demings in Florida and Cheri Beasley in North Carolina, who might face tough general election races if they win their primaries, have avoided tweeting about Biden...</p><p>They want to develop a brand distinct from Biden and the national Democratic Party.</p><p>Good luck with that. Should they consider calling themselves non-independents, or perhaps anti-Republicans? A number of participants in House races appear to be allergic to the Biden brand. Ms. Mucha writes:</p><p>Many Democrats in front-line districts have also stopped mentioning the president on their campaign accounts since Sept. 1, per data compiled by Quorum and reviewed by Axios.</p><p>That was a day after the administration completed its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>Reps. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Jared Golden (D-Maine), Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) and Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) were among the front-line members who haven't mentioned \"Biden\" or \"@POTUS\" on their campaign accounts since Sept. 1.</p><p>Reps. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) and Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.) have mentioned Biden's name but only in the context of urging him to act on specific issue matters.</p><p>Symptoms of a possible Biden allergy seem to be afflicting not just the Democratic Party's most vulnerable candidates but the party itself. Several email fundraising pitches sent out by the Democratic National Committee in recent days have not included the word \"Biden.\" One particularly striking example from Rep. Eric Swalwell (D., Calif.) avoided mentioning the president even while noting laws that he signed into law:</p><p>We passed the American Rescue Plan to keep people safe and healthy and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create good-paying jobs for working families. And we did all of this with incredibly narrow congressional majorities.</p><p>The good news for America's 46th president is that not every Democrat wants to keep her distance. \"Joe hates to ask for money, but this deadline is too important for me not to reach out,\" wrote First Lady Jill Biden in a Sunday pitch seeking to create urgency before the party closes the books on its monthly fundraising. Beyond the subject line, the first lady mentioned her husband several times in the email, each time favorably. She also told readers:</p><p>Renewing your DNC membership not only helps our party invest in critical races, but also shows the world that we are standing shoulder to shoulder in the fight ahead.</p><p>Many congressional Democrats have decided to stand somewhere else.</p><p>***</p><p>Taranto Principle Endures</p><p>This column's most celebrated alumnus developed a counterintuitive theory that leftist media bias actually harms Democrats in many elections because it encourages them to adopt unpopular positions. The theory has proven to be quite durable. To take one recent example, in the absence of biased media coverage, what politician would have decided that voters were eager to see fewer police officers in their neighborhoods?</p><p>A new interview suggests that leftist media bias also hurts Democratic candidates in another way: They may neglect to communicate their messages in the belief that friendly media will take care of such tasks.</p><p>Sean Illing of Vox shares an interview today with Dan Pfeiffer, a former communications director for President Barack Obama. Here's an excerpt:</p><p>Sean Illing</p><p>It's not a giant mystery, but let's start with the obvious: Why is the Democratic brand so weak right now?</p><p>Dan Pfeiffer</p><p>You don't need a political science degree or a master pollster to see what's going on. Things are not great. People are p</p><p>----</p><p>d off, and Democrats are in charge. I mean, that was the problem in the Virginia gubernatorial election, and that's the problem nationally. People are incredibly exhausted and frustrated...</p><p>Sean Illing</p><p>Why do you think the Democrats' message is falling flat? Things are bad and Democrats have definitely had a ton of setbacks, but they have also gotten plenty done. Why is none of that getting through?</p><p>Dan Pfeiffer</p><p>The biggest problem is that most Democrats continue to believe the best way we're going to communicate, or maybe the only way to communicate our message, is through traditional press. We're going to tell the New York Times, we're going to tell CNN, we're going to tell the Richmond Times-Dispatch, and they're going to communicate that to the public. That model hasn't worked for a very long time.</p><p>We're in a world where Facebook dominates, where right-wing propaganda and disinformation dominates. The idea that anyone other than the most plugged-in news junkies are going to have any real information about what's happening is just folly.</p><p>Our party tends to think the press will do our job for us.</p><p>Is it an unreasonable expectation?</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>***</p><p>He Who Must Not Be Named in Swing Districts</p>",
