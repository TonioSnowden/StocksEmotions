  "title": "Universal Isn't Only Payoff From Vivendi --- Spinoff isn't just one way investors can profit",
  "text": "<p>On Tuesday, investors in the French media company will vote on plans to hand up to 60% of Universal Music to shareholders and list the record label on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Daniel Loeb's Third Point hedge fund has built a stake in the business, while Wisconsin-based Artisan Partners and U.K. activist Bluebell Capital Partners also own the stock.</p><p>Shareholders have complained about the structure of the split, which could leave them with a tax bill equivalent to roughly 15% of the value of the Universal Music shares they receive through a dividend-in-kind. All the while, Vivendi's main shareholder, Vincent Bollore, gets an exemption, as would any other French holder of more than 5% of the business.</p><p>Bluebell has asked Vivendi to pay a multibillion-euro special dividend to offset the hit. Investors are also puzzled about the logic of a deal with Bill Ackman's blank-check company, signed on Sunday. The sale of a 10% stake in Universal Music for $4 billion to Pershing Square Tontine Holdings has been struck at an underwhelming valuation.</p><p>Investors probably don't have the power to block the Ackman deal if they wanted to, or to get a special dividend. The company's anchor shareholder Mr. Bollore controls almost 30% of the voting rights and a simple majority is needed to get the plan through.</p><p>But there are other opportunities to profit. The obvious one is a pop in Universal's shares. JPMorgan recently estimated the record label's value at 50 billion euros, or $59.5 billion at current exchange rates, compared with the 35 billion euro price tag in the Ackman deal.</p><p>What remains of Vivendi after the split is \"black-box governance . . . and a motley crew of assets,\" said Bernstein analyst Matti Littunen. Growth investors are likely to dump the stock as soon as they can get direct exposure to a spun-off Universal Music.</p><p>But activists are likely to sit tight. There are signs Mr. Bollore hopes to take Vivendi private: Also up for a vote Tuesday is a proposal that would allow the company to buy back up to 50% of its shares and cancel them. This has echoes of a move the French billionaire pulled in 2012, when he avoided a mandatory takeover bid for advertising company Havas by using share buybacks to pass the 30% threshold.</p><p>Other events could move Vivendi's valuation. The company, whose largest remaining asset is French pay-TV company Canal Plus, has built a 27% stake in publishing and duty-free giant Lagardere with a view to taking control, according to a person close to the company. Hedge funds also hope that Vivendi can be simplified, perhaps through a sale of some of its minority stakes in other businesses.</p><p>In Mr. Bollore, activists see an acquisitive figure whose holdings in Vivendi are just below the 30% level that triggers French mandatory takeover laws. His intentions are famously hard to read, but any sign that he wants greater control over Vivendi gives hedge funds a good reason to stick around.</p>",
