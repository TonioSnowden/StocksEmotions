  "text": "<p>Mr. Aron hired J.P.Morgan Securities LLC to handle the sale of 1.25 million shares, according to a securities filing. A separate filing on Wednesday showed he sold half of those shares Tuesday at an average price of $40.53. He will transact all the sales under a pre-arranged trading plan he adopted in August.</p><p>Mr. Aron had said on an earnings call Monday that he would soon begin selling some of his shares.</p><p>\"I can only imagine that naysayers and others who wish AMC harm will try to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt in this regard,\" Mr. Aron said, noting that even after his sales he will still own more than 2 million shares.</p><p>\"If you do the math, you will see that with this much current and future ownership of AMC, I have an enormous personal stake in the future of our company, of your company,\" he said.</p><p>For the latest quarter ended September 30, AMC reported nearly 40 million attendees, up from about 22 million in the prior quarter but still behind pre-pandemic levels. Higher vaccination rates have played a role in the improvement, while new movies like the James Bond installment \"No Time to Die\" and \"Dune\" have also helped AMC sell tickets since the quarter ended, Mr. Aron said on the call.</p><p>The company reported a net loss of $224 million for the quarter, an improvement from the net loss of $906 million it reported for the same period in 2020.</p><p>AMC came close to having to file for bankruptcy during the pandemic and was able to improve its financial position by selling shares to retail investors, as well as inking some financing deals from institutional investment funds.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p>",
