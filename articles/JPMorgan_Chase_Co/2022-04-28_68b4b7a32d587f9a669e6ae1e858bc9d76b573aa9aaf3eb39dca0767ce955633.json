  "title": "Carvana Turns to Apollo for Cash Infusion    ----  By Matt Wirz and Kristin Broughton",
  "text": "<p>   Carvana Co.'s financial troubles spilled over into debt markets this week when the online used-car dealer struggled to sell bonds and was forced to turn to Apollo Global Management for $1.6 billion to salvage the deal. </p><p>   The investment firm agreed to buy about half of $3.275 billion of bonds Carvana Co. is issuing to purchase car-auction network Adesa US., people familiar with the matter said. Carvana had a hard time attracting investors following a disappointing first-quarter earnings report and stock selloff. </p><p>   Apollo's intervention highlights the growing clout of private debt and equity firms that are bankrolling swaths of the U.S. economy. </p><p>   Shares of Carvana surged during the pandemic but tumbled over the past eight months as secondhand car prices declined and investors grew concerned about the company's continued losses. Adesa was meant to accelerate growth, and Carvana hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to raise billions of dollars in debt and equity to pay for the purchase and subsequent integration. </p><p>   The financing ran into headwinds last week when the company reported a more than sixfold increase in net losses for the first quarter of 2022 from a year earlier. The company was one of the biggest losers in the tech stock selloff, which was driven by rising interest rates and worries about a recession. </p><p>   Carvana blamed a mix of tough economic conditions -- rising interest rates, higher gas prices, inflation-weary consumers -- for its first-ever decline in quarterly retail sales. It also acknowledged to investors that the constant pressure to continue its rapid expansion has played an outsized role in its priorities and pledged to reduce costs and improve its efficiency. </p><p>   The deal with Apollo is an acknowledgment that filling the hole in its balance sheet had taken precedence over growth. The onerous interest rate on the debt could make it difficult for the company to invest in future growth. Carvana has burned cash since its founding 10 years ago. </p><p>   Carvana shares dropped about 30% in recent weeks and bond prices also fell, pushing up the yield that bond investors demanded to lend the company more money. Bond yields rise when prices fall. Carvana announced on Monday plans to issue $2.275 billion of bonds and $1 billion of preferred shares for the Adesa acquisition. </p><p>   Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III and his father, Ernie Garcia II, participated in a roughly $1.2 billion new common stock issue to boost cash levels. Apollo privately committed to buy $600 million of the preferred shares but JPMorgan struggled to find enough buyers for the bonds, fund managers who considered the deal said. </p><p>   By Tuesday, the clearing yield for the bond deal was above 10.5%, a level that might have forced JPMorgan to forgo some or all of its fees for the financing, the fund managers said. </p><p></p>",
