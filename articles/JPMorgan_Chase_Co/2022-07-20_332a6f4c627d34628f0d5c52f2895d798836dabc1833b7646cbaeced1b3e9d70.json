  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase's investment bank has set up a unit to compete with growing competition from direct lenders, committing a “significant chunk of capital” to hold leveraged loans on its balance sheet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e\">JPMorgan</a> is funding the loans and intends to hold them to maturity rather than underwriting the debt for syndication, a practice where the bank is already a dominant player. </p> <p>“We were always catching this fish, it was just that we were throwing it back — now we want to hold on to it,” Kevin Foley, JPMorgan's head of global debt capital markets, told the Financial Times in an interview. </p> <p>He said JPMorgan had committed “a significant chunk of capital” to the effort, without providing further details. The bank began making the loans in 2021 and has completed around 20 deals, with the size ranging from $50mn to around $500mn, Foley said. </p> <p>“This is modern-day relationship lending. We have to adjust,” Foley added. “We have a team of six dedicated to direct lending across banking, markets and commercial banking.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The move by JPMorgan, the largest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/456d01ad-ea50-4aa7-8d7f-b9737216d453\">US bank</a> by assets, is an early signal of how banks might realign their leveraged lending operations to win favour with clients and claw back market share lost to direct lenders such as Apollo, Ares and Golub Capital. </p> <p>These lenders are funding a growing number of leveraged buyouts by private equity firms. The direct lending industry had grown to more than $500bn in assets under management at the end of 2021 from less than $50bn a decade ago, according to Preqin data. </p> <p>Several banks, including JPMorgan, have raised outside funds through their asset management arms to invest in private credit. But the loans Foley's team is working on are funded by the bank rather than investors. </p> <p>JPMorgan typically provides acquisition financing for leveraged buyouts through leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, which the bank underwrites with the intention of mainly selling to other investors. For more than a decade, the bank has been a top-two player in the US leveraged loan and high-yield debt markets, according to Refinitiv data. </p> <p>This form of financing is typically cheaper for the borrower, as the debt is offered to a broader range of buyers, and it remains the go-to option for most takeovers. However, it is more prone to market swings and the terms can be less reliable. </p> <p>It can also leave banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b7c3b06-f065-4ee0-b1e9-b850e155a17a\">nursing mark-to-market losses</a> on loans they agreed to underwrite but struggle to sell. Lenders including JPMorgan face losses on tens of billions of dollars of bridge loans backing leveraged buyouts that were agreed before slumping markets made it harder to shift the debt to specialist funds.</p> <p>As an alternative, so-called direct lenders, which raise billions of dollars in outside funds from investors, are promising financing less dependent on the broader market and with a greater degree of certainty that the borrower will receive the funds. </p> <p>These firms typically lend to the smaller companies — which often struggle to access the syndicated leveraged loan market — that traditional banks pulled away from following post-financial crisis regulations. </p> <p>They are also gradually doing bigger and bigger deals. In one notable <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a67e36e-b42f-42e1-8c17-042108fb014e\">example</a> last year, $2.6bn in debt financing for Thoma Bravo's $6.6bn acquisition of Stamps.com was provided entirely by private lenders, including Ares, Blackstone and PSP Investments.</p> <p>The new JPMorgan unit is part of its push to deepen its offering to so-called middle-market corporate customers and is a response to demand from clients, according to Foley. </p> <p>“Size hasn't been a constraint. It's more the opportunity set. We're willing to do bigger deals,” he added. </p> <p>One hurdle regulated banks like JPMorgan have faced in competing with direct leaders is that they have to consider leveraged lending <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67b625e7-87ab-478e-aca1-995f150e6b9c\">guidance from bank regulators</a>. This recommends — though does not mandate — that banks do not lend to companies at a ratio of debt to earnings that exceeds six times. </p> <p>As non-banks, direct lenders are not subject to the same strictures, helping them fund particularly highly leveraged buyouts, such as deals in the technology sector for companies that promise high growth but have yet to generate significant profits. </p> <p>“We can do most of the loans, but remain disciplined in our approach,” Foley said. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Antoine Gara in New York</em></p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'JPMorgan takes on direct lenders with leveraged loans unit' FT.com 20 July.
