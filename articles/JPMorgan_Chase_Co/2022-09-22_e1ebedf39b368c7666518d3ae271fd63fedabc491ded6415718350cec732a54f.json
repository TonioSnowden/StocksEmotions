  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The heads of the largest U.S. banks expressed concerns about the state of the U.S. economy as they began two days of questioning Wednesday from Congress. </p><p>   Bank chief executives, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s Jamie Dimon and Citigroup Inc.'s Jane Fraser, offered a favorable picture of an industry they say helped the economy recover from a pandemic-induced recession while warning of risks on the horizon. </p><p>   Mr. Dimon said competing forces are affecting the economy. They include strong consumer spending and plentiful job openings amid high inflation, disrupted supply chains, the war in Ukraine and declining consumer confidence. But he said it is difficult to accurately predict whether the Federal Reserve will succeed in achieving a soft landing, in which inflation moderates with only a mild decline in economic activity. </p><p>   \"Because of the war in Ukraine and the uncertainty that causes in global energy supply and food supply, there's a chance it could be worse,\" he said. </p><p>   Asked later about the Fed's ability to avoid a hard landing, Mr. Dimon said: \"I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\" </p><p>   Near the end of the hearing, all the CEOs raised their hands when asked who had confidence that the Fed would have the resolve to fight inflation. </p><p>   The Fed approved its third consecutive interest-rate increase of 0.75 percentage point Wednesday and signaled more big increases were likely. </p><p>   Ms. Fraser said higher rates are likely to moderate growth in the U.S. and other countries. \"We are very concerned about the high prices that consumers are facing in America and indeed around the world,\" she said. </p><p>   The executives appeared Wednesday at a hearing hosted by Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services panel. They are set to appear Thursday in the Senate. </p><p>   Ms. Waters pressed Wells Fargo &amp; Co. CEO Charles Scharf on a series of regulatory and other actions, including a $250 million fine last year for a lack of progress in addressing longstanding issues in its mortgage business. Mr. Scharf said the issues would take years to fix. </p><p>   \"I firmly believe that we are making progress,\" he said. </p><p>   North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel, pressed the banks on the costs of regulations, remarks that come as the Fed begins a broad review of capital and other requirements. </p><p>   In a future downturn, Mr. Dimon said, JPMorgan could be sitting on $1 trillion but \"unable to deploy it.\" He praised the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul but said various postcrisis regulations had gone \"a little bit too far\" and needed to be recalibrated. </p><p>   Banks say they have been unduly constrained by risk-insensitive, size-based capital requirements, including a capital buffer that applies to the largest firms, and another measure related to the treatment of supersafe assets such as Treasurys. Though the Fed allowed a temporary, pandemic-related reprieve from the latter requirement to expire last year, it promised to propose a broader revamp to the rule's treatment of ultrasafe assets. It has yet to do so. </p><p>   Rep. Bill Foster (D., Ill.) criticized banks for what he characterized as repeated efforts to ease postcrisis rules, suggesting the moves would put taxpayers at greater risk. Asked by Mr. Foster to raise their hands if higher postcrisis capital requirements prevented their banks from having \"an extremely profitable decade,\" none of the executives raised their hands. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   David Benoit contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
