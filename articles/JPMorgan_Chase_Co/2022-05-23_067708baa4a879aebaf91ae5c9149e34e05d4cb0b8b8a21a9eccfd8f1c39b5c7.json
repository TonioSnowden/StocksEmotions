  "title": "At Davos This Year, It's Goodbye Snow, Hello Peep-Toe Shoes --- Participants ditch winter garb and debate what's suitable for spring in Alps",
  "text": "<p>Now, with this year's event bumped to May by the pandemic, warm and wet weather has brought a sartorial shift and the pleasant discovery that the town is actually lush and green.</p><p>Nick Studer, chief executive of consulting firm Oliver Wyman Group, arrived on Sunday and right away noticed Davos architecture he had missed during roughly a decade of attending the meetings in the dead of winter.</p><p>\"I don't know if that's normally because I'm looking at my feet, trying to avoid slipping over,\" he said. \"It feels oddly different.\"</p><p>The confab, taking place this year as parts of the world still battle Covid and the Russia-Ukraine war continues, is bringing together more than 2,000 attendees in a new atmosphere. Participants must submit a negative Covid test before arriving and test again on-site following a nine-step protocol.</p><p>Guests arriving this weekend received swag suited to the season: umbrellas, not ice cleats for their boots. There are no ski parties on the agenda. What many delegates took to be a cross-country ski track has revealed itself to be a golf course.</p><p>Winter Davos is rife with odd wardrobe challenges. Participants have to navigate airport-style baggage scanners and security throughout the day. They face boot checks and change into fancier shoes in the open, leaving some of them standing mid-switch in socks or bare feet during chance encounters with power brokers.</p><p>On Sunday, some attendees strolled the sunny streets in T-shirts and jeans. The area was dusted in yellow pollen, not snow.</p><p>Anthony Scaramucci, founder of the hedge-fund investment firm SkyBridge Capital and onetime communications director for the Trump administration, normally wears Timberland boots at Davos cocktail parties and events. This year, he said, he is bringing three pairs of dress shoes, one for each day he plans to attend: Prada loafers, Alden lace-ups and handcrafted Barker shoes from London. He is throwing in some $1,100 Christian Dior sneakers because he considers them \"very Bitcoinish\" for meetings with cryptocurrency people.</p><p>\"I'm a little bit like Imelda Marcos,\" he said. \"I will be dressed as impeccably as I can.\"</p><p>Other guests are opting for NFT-themed sneakers, biodegradable plant-based shoes and shoes that feel comfortable while walking 20,000 steps with an activity-tracking Oura ring.</p><p>Tiffany Harnsongkram, a founder of three companies tied to global sustainability goals, plans to wear her \"fish flops,\" colorful shoes that look like fish right off the hook, with a gaping mouth at the toe. The shoes can be found in Thailand's night markets and help celebrate diversity, she said.</p><p>\"They are a part of me and how I want to show up in the world -- in humor, comfort and, most of all, feeling fully alive,\" said Ms. Harnsongkram, who said she has lived in France, Thailand and the U.S.</p><p>She has avoided Davos in the past partly because she dreaded the cold weather and walking in dress shoes strapped with cleats.</p><p>Nearly 2,500 people made the guest list for the 2022 event, which runs through Thursday, though some are leaving sooner with the next annual gathering less than a year away. Some notable past attendees, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s Jamie Dimon, BlackRock Inc.'s Larry Fink and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.'s Sheryl Sandberg, didn't make the trek. Thousands more visitors are converging around town for bilats -- Davos-speak for bilateral meetings -- and confabs on everything from cryptocurrency to medical psychedelics.</p><p>When he arrived on Sunday, Davos veteran Matthew Prince, CEO of the cybersecurity company Cloudflare Inc., noticed how much easier things were. Instead of lugging his suitcase through snow and ice, he easily wheeled it to his hotel.</p><p>\"There's a little more of the character of the town showing through,\" he said. \"In January, it feels like the town almost disappears.\"</p><p>With rain in the forecast, Mr. Prince brought an umbrella for the first time. He swapped his winter knit caps and heavy jackets for button-down shirts and lightweight blazers.</p><p>Mr. Studer, the Oliver Wyman CEO, said he has spent weeks wondering exactly what to bring to a warmer Davos. \"I've been worried about this for quite a long time,\" he said, laughing. \"Snow is a lot easier to handle. You brush it off, you're absolutely fine.\"</p><p>He arrived wearing dress socks adorned with parrots, a button-down shirt accented with red chili-pepper cuff links and gray Allbirds sneakers. He packed dressier shoes and attire, too. The coat he brought is neither waterproof nor cool, he said.</p><p>Lacey Hunter, co-founder of the interactive mapping startup Proxi and a newcomer to Davos, recently reached out to other women planning to attend, stumped on the question of open-toe shoes. \"Too casual? Too risky?\" she asked. Just to be safe, she got a pedicure with a subtle lilac nail polish and packed her Cole Haan peep toes.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
