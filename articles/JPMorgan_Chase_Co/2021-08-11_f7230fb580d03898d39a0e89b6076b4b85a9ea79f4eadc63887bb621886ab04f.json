  "text": "<p>Teenage gaming addicts have handed the South Korean creator of <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em> a $3.8bn windfall. Yet Tencent-backed Krafton is still struggling to shed its reputation as a one-hit wonder. </p> <p>The company's performance in markets has been embarrassing. It was forced to cut the size of its offering by more than Won1tn ($870m) after regulators raised concerns. Shares then dropped 9 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/394125fd-d18c-48b3-bf6f-c08cce415e3c\">on the first day </a>of trading. They fell a further 10 per cent on Wednesday. </p> <p>Some of this might have been preventable. Just 13 per cent of institutional investors agreed to a lockup. When digital lender Kakao Bank listed last week that figure was more than 40 per cent. </p> <p>The popularity of Krafton's battle royale video game was expected to produce similar enthusiasm in investors. <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, </em>which accounted for 97 per cent of the company's sales in the first quarter,&#xa0;has sold more than 75m copies. </p> <p>The mobile version, the world's highest grossing mobile game last year, has been downloaded more than 1bn times. Operating profit more than doubled to Won774bn ($667m) last year. Sales are forecast to grow 50 per cent in the next year. Krafton wants to use its IP to become an entertainment company, releasing films as well as games. </p> <p>This success partly explains Krafton's initial public offering price at 30 times forward earnings — a premium of up to 50 per cent compared with peers such as Nexon and Activision Blizzard. </p> <p>But the price failed to reflect the risks in Krafton's exposure to China. Some 72 per cent of sales occur via Tencent in China. Beijing's attempts to clean up certain sectors puts gaming companies on the back foot. </p> <p><em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</em> has already been a target. In 2019 it was banned for reasons that included too much gore. It has since been re-released with the colour of blood now green.</p> <p>Further stock price declines will reflect poorly on the underwriters, which include Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Mirae Asset. South Korea's IPO boom has had its first serious knock. </p><p>Source:  2021 'Krafton: public markets present gaming company with a new battleground' FT.com 11 August.
