  "text": "<p>\n  David Kelly, chief global strategist and head of the global market insights strategy team, J.P. Morgan Asset Management </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'We're going to see a bounce. The threat of recession has grown, and the economy is certainly going to slow down. But inflation will come down, prompting the Fed to slow down as well. Unless there's a shock, stocks and bonds can rally.' </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist, Charles Schwab Corp. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'I think not only is a recession likely, I think we may already be in one.' </p><p>\n  'I don't think the Fed's tightening has been reflected yet in corporate profits. In the second half of the year, that may represent the next source of indigestion for stocks.' </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income and head of the global allocation team, BlackRock Inc. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'The other side of downturns like this are almost always significant bouncebacks.' </p><p>\n  'Investors need to be forward-thinking about opportunities as the market stabilizes. I don't recall the prices of good quality assets looking so attractive in years.' </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'We won't see downward earnings revisions fully priced in until the fourth quarter. Until we do, equities won't rebound. Bonds are primed to outperform stocks in the second half of the year.' </p><p>\n  'The probability of a recession is rising, but even our bear case is for a mild recession.' </p><p></p>",
