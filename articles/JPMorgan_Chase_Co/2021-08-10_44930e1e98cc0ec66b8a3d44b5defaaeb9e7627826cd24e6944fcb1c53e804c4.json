  "text": "<p>The chief UK financial regulator is considering new rules that would allow it to block banks from closing high street branches to help ensure consumers and businesses can still use cash, according to people briefed on the watchdog's deliberations.</p> <p>The Treasury said in a consultation last month that it planned to use legislation to give broad powers to the Financial Conduct Authority to guarantee “reasonable” public access to cash facilities, adding the FCA would have “discretion” to set out how standards should be met.</p> <p>Senior regulators have since told lenders and industry groups that they believe in-person banking services should remain important alongside ATMs and other initiatives such as making cashback more widely available, said two people involved in the discussions.</p> <p>One person close to the FCA said that the Treasury consultation did not make clear definitions but that the watchdog was “pretty clear where it's going”. “Powers will allow them to say: ‘If there aren't good enough face-to-face services in place, we can block [branch closures]'.”</p> <p>The FCA declined to comment.</p> <p>Banks have closed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f20862af-b330-4d04-8c50-2f0738a0f9e8\">thousands of branches</a> and ATMs in recent years in an effort to cut costs.</p> <p>Lenders said the closures reflected the transition from in-person banking and widespread cash usage to online services and digital payments, but the changes have raised fears that millions of older and more vulnerable customers could be left behind.</p> <p>The prospect of being forced by the FCA to keep branches open is likely to put pressure on banks to support initiatives to develop shared infrastructure. This would allow them to cut some costs without leaving communities without a single branch.</p> <p>Big banks are currently funding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32ee4c5b-efdd-42a5-bef7-a0d81bfc58d5\">pilot schemes</a> to test different ways of improving cash access, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a291077-92f7-4c5c-af72-14496fc2904e\">shared hubs</a> which are managed by the Post Office but offer services from multiple lenders.</p> <p>UK Finance, the industry lobby group, said: “We understand the importance of cash for many people and the banking and finance sector has publicly committed to ensuring continued access for those who need it.”</p> <p>It added: “We will use the learnings from these pilots to develop a longer term solution, working with government and regulators to consider the best approach to sustain access to cash across the UK.”</p> <p>Another person involved in the discussions between the FCA and the banks said most lenders understood the need for in-person services in some areas, particularly larger towns, but added they were pushing the regulator to be “flexible” in the way it implements any new rules.</p> <p>“In a small village, cashback in the local shop and an ATM might meet most needs, but a bigger town will have more complex needs that will require different solutions,” the person said.</p> <p>Big banks are concerned about being forced to bear extra costs that could disadvantage them if they are not also applied to new rivals.&#xa0;</p> <p>Financial technology companies such as Starling Bank and Monzo, which have no branches, have won millions of customers in recent years. US banking group JPMorgan Chase is planning to open a branchless UK retail business later this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Treasury consultation said the list of companies covered by cash access legislation would “be kept under review and subject to change in [the] event of shifts in the market structure”.</p> <p>The Treasury said on Monday: “We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK.</p> <p>“That's why we are consulting on proposals for new laws to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash.&#xa0;Responses to the consultation will help to inform the final legislation.”</p> <p><br><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60a4f4fb-c93a-482f-87bc-5de06f68ef87\"><em>Renationalise the Post Office before it disappears</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60a4f4fb-c93a-482f-87bc-5de06f68ef87\"><em>From MJ Pugh, London IG8, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Nicholas Megaw in London 2021 'UK banks face block on high street branch closures' FT.com 10 August.
