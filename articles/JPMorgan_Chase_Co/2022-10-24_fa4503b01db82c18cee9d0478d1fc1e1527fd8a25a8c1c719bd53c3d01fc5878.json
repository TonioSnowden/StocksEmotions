  "text": "<p>\"If we had tried maintain what we had a year ago, it would have been like getting drunk…and then trying to stay drunk…to avoid a hangover. What the Fed is trying to do is to keep a bad hangover from becoming a horrendous one…but they're also trying to make sure we don't get drunk again……….It's a very tough job,\" he writes.</p><p>That brings us to our call of the day from hedge fund Saba Capital's founder Boaz Weinstein, who warns of a \"real headwind\" for investors from central bank tightening that could trigger a decades-long bear market, such as seen in Japan. And he lays the best bets in this gloomy atmosphere.</p><p>\"I'm very pessimistic. There isn't a rainbow at the end of all of this,\" Weinstein said in an interview with the Financial Times that published on Monday. \"There's no reason that this difficult [economic] period will only last two to three quarters [and]..no reason to think we'll have a soft landing or a shallow recession.\"</p><p>Weinstein may be worth listening to for a couple of reasons. Firstly, his flagship fund reportedly returned 73% in 2020 for its bets against junk bonds. Trading credit default swaps, which insure against company defaults, remains a big part of his strategy.</p><p>The manager also reportedly won big by taking the other side of a trade in 2012 by JPMorgan's \"London Whale\" trader Bruno Iksil, who racked up a $6 billion loss for the bank.</p><p>As for how he's playing a lengthy bear market for stocks, Weinstein is putting his money on credit-default swaps because he thinks a recession will trigger more corporate defaults and lead to dramatic widening of credit spreads. He cautions against equity market options, which he said won't pay off unless stocks dramatically plunge.</p><p>Weinstein says that big market plunge hasn't come yet because because too many \"problematic things are swirling around, some that are contradictory,\" such as war, inflation, energy crisis and China woes. So investors have had time to slowly absorb the bad news, and reduce risk at that pace.</p><p>\"This year has been like a horror movie but with five monsters — you don't know what to focus on, so you deleverage.\"</p><p>The markets</p><p>It's been choppy for stock futures ES00 NQ00 , which are now now pushing higher, as bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Ypulling back and the dollar DXY modestly higher.
