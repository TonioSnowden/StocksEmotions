Adjusted for population, at about 40 per 100,000 people, it is only a third of that in the UK.</p> <p><em>Thanks for your comments about Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill, like Janice Richardson who wrote in to say she believes BBB was weakened by moderate Democrats before it was “killed” by Manchin.

Chile's stock market and currency fall after Boric victory</strong> The Chilean peso fell more than 4 per cent against the dollar yesterday, reaching an all-time closing low, and Santiago's IGPA index fell more than 6 per cent. The margin of victory for former student leader Gabriel Boric <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b812367a-c020-43fa-b9a3-412546248604\">was much wider than predicted</a> by pollsters.</p> <p><strong>2. BNP Paribas to exit US retail market</strong> French bank BNP Paribas has become the latest European lender to exit US retail banking after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8cd3541-8869-4ef7-ac96-f0c528edbc02\">agreeing to sell</a> its San Francisco-based Bank of the West to Bank of Montreal for $16.3bn. European banks have struggled to compete with US rivals like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.</p> <p><strong>3. Closing argument in Ghislaine Maxwell trial</strong> Ghislaine Maxwell worked “hand-in-hand” with Jeffrey Epstein <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ea16edc-bad1-4f57-a745-8bd47cbfc954\">to sexually abuse underage women</a>, a federal prosecutor told jurors in closing arguments as she urged them to convict the British socialite of sex trafficking after three weeks of evidence. “Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein,” said Laura Menninger, an attorney for the accused.</p> <p><strong>4. SEC demands more risk disclosure for Chinese companies</strong> The request <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/552615e1-03e5-41f4-a8f5-26de4c3d52a6\">seeks more information</a> on Chinese companies' use of variable interest entities, a complicated legal structure used by tech groups to circumvent Beijing's stringent foreign investment restrictions. New York-listed companies including Alibaba, Pinduoduo and Baidu all use VIEs to run their operations.</p> <p><strong>4. UK Supreme Court thwarts Maduro's $1.9bn gold bid </strong>The court <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b401c73-88c6-4e7e-a064-877e357aa0df\">dealt a blow</a> to Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in his fight to gain control of $1.9bn of disputed gold reserves after it ruled that opposition leader Juan Guaidó should be recognised as the country's legitimate head of state.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>FTSE All-World Index</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2759946-e201-41f0-afdf-1ee3994594ad\">fell 1.3 per cent</a> yesterday, marking its worst one-day slide since shortly after the discovery of Omicron last month. Investors feared the pandemic may choke off the global economic recovery but European stocks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1d32556-c3d3-4910-b9ce-3dd577c8c4f4\">have rebounded</a> today.</p></li>  <li><p>Boris Johnson yesterday faced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebba9620-eb98-46ba-a474-1114c0b7cb29\">a wave of cabinet opposition</a> to new proposed Covid-19 restrictions in <strong>England</strong>, forcing him to shelve decisions on a potential post-Christmas “circuit breaker” until ministers have seen new data.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>World Economic Forum</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a04d6c98-99e0-4182-8465-0ffb6345baf9\">scrapped plans</a> to hold an in-person annual meeting in Davos next month amid uncertainty over the Omicron variant. </p></li>  <li><p>Protection from two doses of the <strong>Oxford/AstraZeneca </strong>vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d7371c2-c248-4833-b9c9-2f91f48a4725\">begins to wane</a> three months after the second shot, according to a new study. Early evidence shows a “clear” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7de3bdd1-84a8-42ae-af37-2bbb8c584c49\">drop in the effectiveness</a> of current Covid-19 vaccines against the Omicron, the head of the European drugs regulator told the Financial Times.</p></li>  <li><p>Here's what we know about <strong>the new strain</strong> that is more infectious but possibly less virulent from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c5ff3d-e676-4076-9b9f-7243a00cba5e\">our frequently updated explainer</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Biden Omicron speech</strong> The president will outline new measures to slow the spread of Omicron.

Economists have forecast that the nation's current account deficit hit $205bn in the third quarter, up from a 14-year high of $190.3bn in the second quarter.</p> <p><strong>Earnings</strong>: General Mills, the company behind Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, is expected to report a smaller profit year on year for its fiscal second quarter, as inflation weighs on the bottom line. <em>Yesterday we mistakenly reported that General Mills was reporting for which we apologise. </em></p> <p><strong>Liz Truss and Maros Sefcovic talk </strong>The UK's foreign secretary, who has been put in charge of the Brexit negotiations following the weekend resignation of David Frost, will speak to her opposite number in Brussels <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06853c58-a19e-4bce-81b9-06760e24b2df\">for the first time</a>.</p> <p><strong>Winter solstice in the northern hemisphere </strong>Those <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80d80dd3-ce3b-42fb-9ed2-33ffa724e804\">marking the occasion</a> include, in the UK, druids at Stonehenge.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>A tale of two elites in Washington and Beijing&#xa0;</strong>One of the few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on is that America should treat China as a serious and dangerous global rival, <a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-31d26514-11f1-4c07-9900-6265870191cd/0qAh2B1ktOwX0QE2SViddw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjo4HoP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMzFkMjY1MTQtMTFmMS00YzA3LTk5MDAtNjI2NTg3MDE5MWNkP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjFjMGZhNTE0MThlNDgwMDA0MjJiYzU0JnNlZ21lbnRJZD02MGExMjZlOC1kZjNjLWI1MjQtYzk3OS1mOTBiZGU4YTY3Y2RXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphuxH9wGFoxEJ_UhNnb3Jkb24uc21pdGhAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA\">writes Gideon Rachman</a>.
