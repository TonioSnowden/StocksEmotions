Kathy Hochul said Friday that New Yorkers must wear masks in public indoor places unless those places require people to be vaccinated against Covid-19. That requirement went into effect Monday.</p><p>Tuesday, JPMorgan began requiring vaccination proof for all employees and visitors to enter its New York office buildings, a step other banks had taken before.</p><p>The work-from-home order is considered temporary and the bank is studying potential other solutions to deal with the state order.</p><p>JPMorgan also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated employees in the New York corporate offices.</p><p>\"It seems unfair to require our vaccinated employees to wear masks all day at their desks,\" the bank said in the memo.</p>",
