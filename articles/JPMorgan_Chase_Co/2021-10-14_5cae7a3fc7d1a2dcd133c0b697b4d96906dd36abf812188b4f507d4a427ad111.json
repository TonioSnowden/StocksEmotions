  "text": "<p>Big banks are moving beyond the initial shock of last year's pandemic economic collapse and contending with a new normal. Consumers and businesses have largely continued to pay their loans, prompting Wells Fargo to release $1.65 billion of reserves it had stockpiled for those losses.</p><p>But low rates and a fragile economy have curtailed demand for banks' bread and butter business of making loans. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said on Wednesday that its total loans were roughly flat compared with three months earlier, but up 6% versus a year ago.</p><p>Wells Fargo's revenue fell 2% to $18.83 billion. That beat the $18.27 billion expected by analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The bank's net interest income, a measure of lending profits, fell 5% to $8.91 billion.</p><p>Wells Fargo is still trying to work past its five-year-old sales-practice scandal, where it created perhaps millions of phony accounts. In September, Wells Fargo paid a $250 million fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of its top regulators, for failing to fix problems in its mortgage business. Another regulator, the Federal Reserve, still has a cap on how much the bank can grow.</p><p>Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>More on Wall Street Earnings</p><p>Recent stories selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* Bank of America Quarterly Profit Rises 58%</p><p>* BlackRock Results Helped by Actively Managed Funds</p><p>* Heard on the Street: JPMorgan Shows Why Bank Stocks Are Stuck in Neutral</p><p>Wells Fargo Profit Rises 59% On Reserve Release</p>",
