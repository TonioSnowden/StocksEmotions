  "title": "U.S. Stocks Waver Amid Wave of Bank Earnings Reports; Twitter zigzags after Elon Musk discloses offer to take it private",
  "text": "<p>Investors got their first peek at how companies fared in the first quarter of 2022 as earnings season kicked off in earnest this week. Over the past year, corporate earnings have largely been on a tear thanks to government stimulus payments and strong consumer spending. The fear among traders and investors is that rising inflation will end that trend.</p><p>\"We're starting to see some cracks in the foundation of the super strong consumer, and it's starting to have some impact on company bottom lines,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \"Retail sales are still good, but we saw JPMorgan is going to raise their provisions for credit losses because there could be some defaults. At Wells Fargo, we're seeing some impact of higher mortgage rates. Sentiment is not as good.\"</p><p>Wells Fargo shares fell more than 4% in recent trading after the bank reported a drop in first-quarter earnings. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all reported results that were better than analysts' forecasts. JP Morgan reported Wednesday.</p><p>Big U.S. banks were expected to suffer from comparisons to bumper profits during the pandemic. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 banks fell 37% from a year ago, according to FactSet.</p><p>Twitter shares, which earlier were up more than 5% and subsequently fell into negative territory, were recently up less than 0.1%. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk—who already holds a more than 9% stake in the social-media company—disclosed an offer to buy the company outright in a deal valuing it at more than $43 billion. Tesla fell 3.6%.</p><p>More broadly, the S&amp;P 500's communications-services sector, of which Twitter is a component, was down about 1%. Its tech sector was off 1.3%.</p><p>Looking ahead, corporate results will be scrutinized for guidance on how companies expect to manage tighter policy from the Federal Reserve, with a series of interest-rate increases expected.</p><p>\"Investors are trying to figure out if the Fed is on the right course. Can they stick the landing in terms of bringing inflation down without bringing the economy down?\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.808% from 2.688% on Wednesday. While wavering in recent days, the yield on the benchmark note earlier this week hit its highest level since January 2019 as investors gear up for rising interest rates. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>In economic news, U.S. consumer sentiment rose in April, beating the consensus forecast of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, according to the University of Michigan. March consumer retail and restaurant spending rose by 0.5% from the previous month, according to the Commerce Department.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, closed up 2.7% to $111.70 a barrel, rising nearly 9% for the week. Natural-gas prices rose, unusual for this season. U.S. natural-gas futures for May delivery were up 4.3% Thursday to settle at $7.3000 per million British thermal units—a 96% rise in the year to date and the highest settle value since October 2008.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7% as gains for travel stocks balanced losses for telecommunication companies. The European Central Bank said in a statement Thursday that recent economic data made it more likely that the bank would end its net bond purchases in the third quarter, confirming plans to rapidly roll back the easy-money policies adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.2%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@dowjones.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Waver Amid Wave of Bank Earnings Reports</p>",
