  "text": "<p>The pullback is easily the largest since the Chinese bond market was made more accessible to foreigners in mid-2017, with the launch of the Bond Connect trading link with Hong Kong.</p><p>The move, coupled with the addition of Chinese debt to influential indexes, helped spur a surge in inbound buying.</p><p>International investors last month reduced bond positions by a total of 109.4 billion yuan, equivalent to about $16.2 billion, a similar amount to April, according to data from two clearinghouses, the China Central Depository &amp; Clearing Co. and the Shanghai Clearing House.</p><p>Foreign investors began paring holdings of Chinese bonds in February, the month that Russia invaded Ukraine, which created concerns around the geopolitical risks of investing in China.</p><p>In April, yields on Chinese government bonds fell below the yields on equivalent U.S. Treasurys for the first time in more than a decade, removing an attraction for foreign investors in Chinese debt.</p><p>Chinese government-bond yields have been rangebound this year while Treasury yields have soared, thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases to combat persistently high inflation.</p><p>As of Wednesday's settlement, the 10-year Treasury note yielded 3.389%, versus the 2.841% yield on the 10-year Chinese government bond, according to Tullett Prebon data.</p><p>Extended Covid-19 lockdowns in China have also weighed heavily on growth in the world's second-largest economy, making Chinese bonds less appealing to investors. Since mid-April, the yuan has weakened rapidly, and on May 12, it slid to more than 6.82 to the dollar, its lowest point since September 2020.</p><p>Foreigners' positions in Chinese bonds totaled the equivalent of $542.8 billion at the end of May, their lowest level in a year, according to CCDC.</p><p>Arthur Lau, head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, said his firm has been underweight Chinese government debt and policy-bank bonds since the start of this year.</p><p>\"The rate trajectory in China is a completely different story from the U.S.,\" he said, adding that he expects Treasury yields to climb further this year as the Fed raises rates to combat inflation.</p><p>China's macroeconomic environment, on the other hand, \"continues to be very weak, and the slowdown is gathering pace,\" he said.</p><p>While Beijing is expected to ease policy and increase government spending to arrest the downturn, Chinese bond yields are unlikely to move much, he said.</p><p>The yuan could also weaken, which would hurt returns for dollar-based investors such as PineBridge, he added. \"We don't think it's a good time to increase our positions in local government bonds because of the FX concern.\"</p><p>The calculus is different for bond investors that are focused on Asia's emerging markets, said Jason Pang, a senior portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong.</p><p>While a U.S. dollar-based index of Chinese government bonds is down about 2.6% this year on a total-return basis, it has performed better than government-bond indexes for most other countries.</p><p>\"As an Asian investor you would not be better off being underweight China versus the rest of the region,\" Mr. Pang said, adding that his firm remains invested in Chinese government debt.</p><p>Foreign holdings are largely, but not entirely, composed of Chinese government bonds and of bonds issued by large government-backed lenders known as policy banks.</p><p>May's decrease included a net reduction of 14 billion yuan in foreigners' holdings of onshore Chinese government bonds, figures released on Wednesday by the CCDC showed.</p><p>International investors also sold a net 74.63 billion yuan of notes issued by policy banks.</p><p>The continued outflow happened despite Chinese regulators' recent effort to boost foreign investors' interests in the Chinese bond market.</p><p>On May 27, the People's Bank of China, China Securities Regulatory Commission and State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued a directive to further open up the Chinese bond market to foreign investors.</p><p>They said that starting from June 30, foreign investors will be allowed to invest in onshore exchange-based bond markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as accessing the interbank debt market in which they are already trading.</p>",
