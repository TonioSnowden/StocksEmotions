  "title": "U.S. News:  Democrats in Texas  Hold Up Voting Bill  ---  After GOP is denied a  quorum on restrictions,  governor plans special  session of legislature  ----  By Elizabeth Findell",
  "text": "<p>   Texas Democrats killed a bill that would have set some of the nation's broadest restrictions on voting, walking off the state House floor on Sunday shortly ahead of a midnight deadline and denying Republicans a quorum necessary to vote. </p><p>   Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he would consider the bill again during a special session of the state legislature, which typically meets only every two years. </p><p>   \"I declared Election Integrity and Bail Reform to be must-pass emergency items for this legislative session,\" he said Sunday night. \"It is deeply disappointing and concerning for Texas that neither will reach my desk.\" </p><p>   The Texas Legislature is controlled by Republicans, with 67 Democrats and 83 Republicans in the House, and 13 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the Senate. Democrats don't have enough power to stop the bill if Mr. Abbott calls a special session, but the walkout may give the public an opportunity to respond to provisions unveiled just hours before votes took place on the legislation. </p><p>   Both legislative chambers passed different versions of the bill in April and May. The legislation, which Republicans said would secure elections, and Democrats and civil-rights groups said would suppress voting, had come back to the state House and Senate for final votes in the last days of the legislature's biennial session. </p><p>   A committee formed to reconcile the two versions released a new one Saturday afternoon. It added several of the most fought-over measures from the Senate bill back into the House version, including prohibitions on late-night and drive-through voting. The bill also placed limits on people who provide voting assistance to those with disabilities and required more meticulous removal of voter registrations for those who might be dead or ineligible. It would make many election missteps or improprieties a felony. </p><p>   The Republican-majority committee met with no allowance for public observation or input and added several measures that hadn't been included in the Senate or House versions. Those included a requirement that mail-in ballots have parts of driver's-licenses or Social Security numbers printed on them and a ban on early voting Sunday mornings that Democrats said would kill \"Souls to the Polls\" events popular in many Black churches. </p><p>   The changes required both chambers to vote again. State senators debated the bill from 10 p.m. Saturday night until 6 a.m. Sunday, before approving it along party lines and returning it to the House. Due to tight deadlines at the end of the legislative session, the House was required to pass it by the end of the day Sunday. That rule handed Democrats an opportunity as the clock approached midnight. They fled the chamber. </p><p>   \"Democrats used the last tool available to us,\" said state Rep. Chris Turner, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, during a news conference after the walkout. \"We denied them a quorum and we killed that bill.\" </p><p>   Democrats nationwide celebrated the move as a principled stand against a voter-suppression effort. Republicans condemned it as a dereliction of duty that set back a party priority. </p><p>   \"Texans shouldn't have to pay the consequences of these members' actions -- or in this case, inaction -- especially at a time when a majority of Texans have exhibited clear and express support for making our elections stronger and more secure,\" Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican, said after the walkout. </p><p></p>",
