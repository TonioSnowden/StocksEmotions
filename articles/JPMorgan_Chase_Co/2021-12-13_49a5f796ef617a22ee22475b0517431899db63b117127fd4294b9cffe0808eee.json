  "text": "<p>Pressure is growing on the US Federal Reserve to accelerate the winding down of its stimulus programme at its meeting later this week in the face of surging inflation, which is now at the highest level in nearly four decades. </p> <p>Data released by Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday revealed the consumer price index <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f355feab-e9f0-4dfc-bcd7-1759983dfb16\">jumped 6.8 per cent in November</a> from a year earlier — the fastest annual pace since 1982 and a significant pick-up from the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a5a7e5f-4207-4de1-9432-002f96de67bb\">6.2 per cent rate in October</a>.</p> <p>There was some relief from the month-on-month figures. Prices between October and November jumped 0.8 per cent, slightly down from the previous month-on-month increase of 0.9 per cent.</p> <p>Stripping out volatile items such as food and energy, core CPI climbed 0.5 per cent from October. That is roughly in line with the previous period, and pushed up the annual pace to 4.9 per cent. Last month, it registered 4.6 per cent.</p> <p>President Joe Biden, who is under pressure to intervene to slow rising prices, on Friday acknowledged that inflation had been a “real bump in the road”. </p> <p>Hawkishness is growing in the Democratic party ahead of midterm elections next year.</p> <p>“The Fed needs to start tapering immediately and then they need to raise interest rates. Both those things can be done by March,” Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat from Massachusetts and member of the House of Representatives financial services committee, which oversees monetary policy, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ae49b1c-f8d6-4c96-8355-3d89049ead60\">told the Financial Times</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month Jay Powell, Fed chair, laid the groundwork for a more aggressive approach to tackling rising prices and scaling back its ultra-accommodative monetary policy when he said it was highly uncertain inflation would moderate next year. He also said it was time to drop the word “transitory” when talking about the inflation outlook.</p> <p>Economists <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87f7b192-df7c-4b25-9c3c-6558fecec48b\">now expect the Fed</a> to double the tapering pace and cease expanding the size of its balance sheet in March, setting the stage for a series of interest rate increases in 2022.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
