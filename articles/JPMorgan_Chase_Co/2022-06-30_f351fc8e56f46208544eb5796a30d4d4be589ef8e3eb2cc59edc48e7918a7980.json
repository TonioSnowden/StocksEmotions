  "text": "<p>Three Arrows operated as a regulated fund manager in Singapore starting in 2013. Last year, it shifted its domicile to the British Virgin Islands as part of a plan to relocate its operations to Dubai.</p><p>Filings in the British Virgin Islands show that Three Arrows drew on a network of international banks during the years before its collapse.</p><p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and ABN Amro Bank NV had charges over Three Arrows in the British Virgin Islands for lending facilities and prime brokerage agreements, according to filings with the BVI Financial Services Commission. A charge is a disclosure companies are required to make when borrowing money or opening a line of credit.</p><p>The filings were published by Offshore Alert, a Miami website focused on unearthing hard-to-obtain corporate filings.</p><p>A lawyer for Three Arrows Capital declined to comment.</p><p>People familiar with the matter said the facilities with JPMorgan and Bank of America aren't active and the banks don't have money at risk.</p><p>An ABN Amro spokesperson declined to comment.</p><p>Singapore's United Overseas Bank had a margin lending agreement with Three Arrows from March 2018 that ended in April 2019, according to the filings. A spokesperson from UOB wasn't immediately available to comment.</p><p>Crypto lender BlockFi also had a charge over assets of Three Arrows that most recently was amended June 17, according to the filings. A spokeswoman for BlockFi said that the firm liquidated or hedged its exposure to Three Arrows earlier in June.</p><p>Hedge funds rely on prime brokerage units of banks to borrow money and amplify potential gains on their investments. The prime brokerage units also help hedge funds execute trades, buying and selling assets on their behalf.</p><p>The documents don't detail whether Three Arrows used any of the borrowing relationships to invest in cryptocurrencies. Wall Street banks have tiptoed carefully when it comes to handling cryptocurrencies directly, waiting for more regulatory clarity.</p><p>The hedge fund originally started off trading emerging-markets currencies, stocks and other traditional financial assets before investing heavily into cryptocurrencies a few years ago. Three Arrows' co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies had previously worked as Wall Street currency traders.</p><p>The Singapore regulator said Thursday that the hedge fund had been approved to manage funds for up to 30 investors and up to 250 million Singapore dollars ($179 million), but it exceeded its allowed assets under management. Three Arrows surpassed this threshold from July 2020 to September 2020 and from November 2020 to August 2021, the central bank said.</p><p>The once-highflying firm's fortunes have soured in recent months after a series of investments in crypto assets declined, including the cryptocurrency Luna whose value was nearly eradicated in a blowup in May. The decline of Luna and its sister cryptocurrency TerraUSD have coincided with a broader risk-off environment that has led the valuations of cryptocurrencies to fall.</p><p>Creditors have called in loans to Three Arrows, which the firm has been unable to repay, spurring notices of default.</p><p>The regulator didn't say how much assets under management Three Arrows had during those periods. Mr. Davies told the Journal earlier this month that Three Arrows was managing around $3 billion in assets in April this year, before the market crash.</p><p>The regulator also said it is assessing if Three Arrows breached additional rules, following concerns over its solvency. The British Virgin Islands appointed two executives from the global advisory firm Teneo this week to oversee the liquidation of Three Arrows' assets and safeguard them.</p><p>Serena Ng contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com</p><p>Singapore Central Bank Reprimands Crypto Hedge Fund Three Arrows, Saying It Flouted Rules</p>",
