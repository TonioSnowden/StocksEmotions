  "title": "U.S. stock futures struggle for direction as earnings season kicks off, producer inflation runs hot",
  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 were down 7 points, or less than 01%, at 34,132.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 3.5 points, or 0.1%, to 4,396.50.</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 were up 38 points, or 0.3%, at 13,983.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP erased strong early gains to end lower.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>First-quarter earnings season was underway as investors digested results from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, BlackRock Inc.BLK, and others.</p><p>Shares of Dow component JPMorgan Chase lost ground in premarket trade, weighing on index futures, after the bank reported lower first-quarter profit that missed Wall Street's estimate, and cast some gloom on the financial sector.</p><p>“JP Morgan's Q1 earnings are the fairly dull bookend to a golden two-year period in banking,” &#xa0;said Octavio&#xa0;Marenzi, CEO of Opimas LLC, a capital markets consulting firm, in emailed comments.</p><p>“During the pandemic, [return on equity] hovered close to 20%. Investment banking and trading did magnificently well, while loan losses remained extremely low. Now, with rising interest rates, JP Morgan's earnings got clobbered, falling by over 40%. This is going to be the new normal in banking for the foreseeable future,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that consensus earnings expectations for the S&amp;P 500 this year have actually moved higher, to $230 in April from $224 in January.</p><p>“Given the myriad headwinds faced by companies in the first quarter and the year ahead, we think first-quarter reporting season has the potential to be a mess. But we also see the potential for it to not be as bad as feared, given the likelihood that buy-side expectations are much lower than official sell-side forecasts – as long as robust assessments of underlying appetite/demand remain in place,” she said.</p><p>Overseas developments meanwhile brought the inflation, and rate-hike, stories back into focus. The U.K. reported the fastest inflation rate in 30 years, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made a bigger-than-forecast half percentage point interest rate hike. The Bank of Canada also is expected to lift rates by a half-point later Wednesday.</p><p>The U.S. producer price index, which measures the cost of wholesale goods and services, jumped 1.4% in March largely because of higher gas and food prices, signaling that U.S. inflation is likely to stay near a 40-year high through the spring. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 1.1% gain. The increase in wholesale prices over the past year jumped to 11.2%, from 10% in the prior month — the highest level since the early 1980s.</p><p>The PPI reading comes a day after the Labor Department reported the strongest year-over-year rise in U.S. consumer prices in 40 years, at 8.5%.</p><p>The CPI data showed a 0.9% drop in durable-goods inflation, at the same time there was a 0.7% gain in services inflation, both evidence of a normalizing economy after pandemic supply disruptions.</p><p>“These core inflation dynamics suggest that underlying price pressures are peaking in the U.S.,” said analysts at BCA Research.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>Shares of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, were little changed after it reported net income that topped expectations.</p><p>Delta shares rallied after reporting stronger-than-forecast results, lifting other airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.AAL in premarket action.</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.BBBY fell 8% after the retailer reported a surprise fourth-quarter loss and missed on sales.</p><p>How other assets are trading</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose 1.7 basis points to 2.742%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.1%.</p><p>Bitcoin BTCUSD fell 0.7% to trade back below $40,000.</p><p>Oil futures extended a rebound to push the U.S. benchmark CL.1 up 1.1% to $101.67 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 were up 0.3% at nearly $1,982 an ounce, on track for a fifth straight daily gain.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP fell 0.4%, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX was off 0.1%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP fell 0.8%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 0.3% in Hong Kong and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK jumped 1.9%.</p>",
