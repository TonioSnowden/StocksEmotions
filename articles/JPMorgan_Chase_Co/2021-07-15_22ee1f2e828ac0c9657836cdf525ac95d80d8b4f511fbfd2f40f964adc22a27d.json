During the three hour-long virtual hearing he largely stuck to his view that the inflation increases would be transitory and eventually subside.</p> <p>A surge in the pace of price growth on both sides of the Atlantic has revived economists' concerns about the risk of overheating.</p> <p>Data published this week showed that US consumer prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/234a9b90-e4f6-4b59-9e39-c6e34ac78276\">rose 5.4 per cent in June</a> compared with a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2008. In the UK, inflation hit 2.5 per cent in the same period, its highest level since 2018, official figures confirmed yesterday. What is driving the price increases? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61346c2f-de96-4ad7-91c1-028efe4706ff\">Our economics teams in the US and Europe explain</a>.</p> <p>US government debt rallied and the dollar weakened as Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/784d4146-7504-413b-962a-038eb9ef6bdf\">tried to ease</a> concerns about the inflation surge.
