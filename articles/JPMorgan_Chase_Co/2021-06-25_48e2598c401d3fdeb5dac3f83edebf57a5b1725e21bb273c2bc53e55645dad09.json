  "text": "<p><strong>UDG Healthcare</strong> said it expects to receive a sweetened takeover offer from buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice that would value the drugs industry outsourcer at around £2.9bn.</p> <p>CD&amp;R has indicated it is considering raising its takeover offer to £10.80 a share, UDG said. The Dublin-based company, which last month indicated it had agreed an £10.23 all-cash offer, said that it intends to recommend the improved final offer if it is made. </p> <p>UDG's plans to sell itself have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22b6c29a-9918-48ef-8578-ee11bc301fcd\">met with opposition from investors</a> including Allianz Global Investors, its largest shareholder, and M&amp;G Investments. Elliott Investment Management, the activist investor and merger arbitrage specialist, said last month it had taken a stake in the company.&#xa0;</p> <p>To allow for the improved offer UDG said it plans to adjourn a shareholder meeting scheduled for today. The company added that since revealing CD&amp;R's offer it had not received any other bid approaches.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>The <strong>Competition and Markets Authority</strong> said it has&#xa0;opened a formal probe into Amazon and Google over concerns that they have not been doing enough to combat fake reviews on their sites. The regulator, which opened its investigation of online fake reviews in May 2020, said it will&#xa0;gather further information&#xa0;to determine whether these two companies may have broken consumer law by taking insufficient action to protect shoppers.</p> <p><strong>Marshall Motor</strong>, the car dealership franchise operator, said it expects to report an “exceptionally strong first half performance in both profit and cash generation”. Full-year underlying pre-tax profit will be significantly ahead of current market expectations thanks to the recent unprecedented used vehicle value appreciation and favourable demand-to-supply conditions for both new and used vehicles, it said.</p> <p>Freight management group <strong>Xpediator</strong> hiked full-year targets to reflect positive first-half trading trends. The Aim-quoted company said that strong trading across all its divisions meant it was on track to deliver a full-year adjusted pre-tax profit in excess of £8.5m.</p> <p>EE is to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa84a5ba-8d08-49f4-a80c-d2e39c02b293\">bring back roaming charges</a> for new UK customers travelling in Europe, becoming the first mobile operator to reintroduce the fee since Brexit. The <strong>BT Group</strong>-owned company said customers joining after July 7 would from January be charged £2 a day to use their data, voice or text allowances in the EU.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p>Drinks maker <strong>AG Barr</strong> named former Dairy Crest chief executive Mark Allen as its chair designate from next month, succeeding John Nicolson, who steps down after seven years in the role. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>The Federal Reserve</strong> has further&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-78f53986-fefa-4208-b4ea-674052a9ca3f/SJP1AnB5XWA6ieuQRXtKXA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRit-fdP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvNzhmNTM5ODYtZmVmYS00MjA4LWI0ZWEtNjc0MDUyYTljYTNmP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBkNTVlOTljNjU0NDcwMDA0ZGUxZmY0JnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpg1ARj1WC4YMYNUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">loosened restrictions on dividends and buybacks</a>&#xa0;imposed on the biggest US banks during Covid-19, as it released an analysis showing lenders could suffer almost $500bn in losses and still comfortably meet capital requirements.</p> <p><strong>Toshiba</strong> shareholders&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-7fc03a35-4915-4f44-bfb2-f4b4db4f4196/sw3qJ-8ViaBdff2-l1dsFQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRit-fdP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvN2ZjMDNhMzUtNDkxNS00ZjQ0LWJmYjItZjRiNGRiNGY0MTk2P2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBkNTVlOTljNjU0NDcwMDA0ZGUxZmY0JnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpg1ARj1WC4YMYNUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">voted against</a>&#xa0;the reappointment of Osamu Nagayama, the chair of the Japanese company's board, in the wake of a report into alleged government collusion.</p> <p><strong>Google</strong> has delayed a plan to end support for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b42db1db-8cfd-4247-90f5-3c6f934b5b3d\">third-party cookies</a> in its Chrome browser by nearly two years.
