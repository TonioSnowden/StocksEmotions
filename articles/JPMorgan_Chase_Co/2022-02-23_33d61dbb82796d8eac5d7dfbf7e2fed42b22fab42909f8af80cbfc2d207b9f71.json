  "text": "<p>Mr. Staley stepped down in November. He was under pressure from U.K. regulators who concluded the executive had provided an incomplete picture of his relationship with Epstein, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, citing people familiar with the investigation.</p><p>Mr. Staley has around 11.2 million unvested shares with a value of £24.3 million, or around $32 million, based on Wednesday's share price. The shares comprise almost 70% of deferred bonus and long-term incentive awards he earned since he took the job in 2015.</p><p>Mr. Staley said at the time of his resignation that he would contest the conclusions made by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Staley declined to comment.</p><p>Reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis made it easier for banks to freeze or clawback compensation promised to executives in case bad behavior later came to light.</p><p>The London-based bank has been looking to move past the distraction created by Mr. Staley's past dealings with Epstein, who was a client of Mr. Staley's when he worked for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>Barclays on Wednesday said it earned £1.12 billion, equivalent to $1.52 billion, in the three months to the end of December. This was higher than the same period last year when the bank earned £220 million. Analysts expected the lender to report a £1.02 billion profit for the quarter.</p><p>It was the first earnings report for new CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan since he took over the top job.</p><p>Mr. Venkatakrishnan has said he would continue Mr. Staley's strategy of maintaining a sizable trans-Atlantic investment bank alongside one of the U.K.'s leading retail and commercial banks. That combination proved resilient through much of the pandemic, as the investment bank boomed on a flurry of deal making and trading.</p><p>\"The broad strategy of the bank is not changing. You should expect some amount of continuity,\" said Mr. Venkatakrishnan on a Wednesday conference call.</p><p>There was one change in the executive ranks, with Anna Cross appointed as group finance director, succeeding Tushar Morzaria, who will be leaving the job on April 22. She was previously his deputy.</p><p>For all of 2021, Barclays earned £6.38 billion, up from £1.53 billion the previous year. A key driver for the rise was the release of £653 million of credit impairments due to an improving economic outlook.</p><p>The bank paid a total dividend of 6 pence per share in 2021 and said that it plans to buy back up to £1 billion of shares. It also said that inflationary pressures are likely to result in modestly higher costs in 2022.</p><p>Shares climbed 2.6% in London trading after the results were published.</p><p>Profit at Barclays's corporate and investment bank was £733 million during the fourth quarter, higher than the same period last year. Trading income saw a sharp decline. Profit at the bank's U.K. unit rose, reaching £420 million. Funds for bankers' bonuses increased by nearly a quarter in 2021, rising to £1.9 billion.</p><p>The decline more recently in investment banking activity mirrors the results of Wall Street's biggest banks, which saw their pandemic-era profits come back down to earth in the last quarter of last year. Both JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc. reported double-digit declines in profit.</p><p>Banks benefited from the volatility in markets, which boosted trading revenue. A surge of deal-making also juiced profits. As major central banks signal tighter monetary policy ahead, this is expected to both boost and disadvantage banks.</p><p>The Bank of England's move to increase its policy interest rate twice since December to 0.5% has lifted the prospect of U.K. banks charging more interest on loans, a key source of revenue. On the other hand, this is also expected to weigh on deal-making, corporate borrowing and mortgage lending activity.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Barclays Freezes Jes Staley's Deferred Pay Until Epstein Probe Concludes</p>",
