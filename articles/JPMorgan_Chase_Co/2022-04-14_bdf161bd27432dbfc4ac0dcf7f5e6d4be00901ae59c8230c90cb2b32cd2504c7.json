  "text": "<p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. profit declined 21% in the first quarter.</p><p>The San Francisco-based bank said Thursday that it made $3.67 billion in the first quarter, down from $4.64 billion a year ago. Per-share earnings totaled 88 cents, above the 81 cents expected from analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The bank posted revenue of $17.59 billion, down 5% from $18.53 billion a year ago. That came in just below expectations of $17.78 billion.</p><p>The declines in profit and revenue spell the end of the pandemic-era boom in bank profits. For the better part of two years, frenetic trading, a red-hot market for deals and generous reserve releases powered earnings at the country's largest banks. No more. Banks are once again preparing for rocky times ahead, concerned that too many interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve could spark a recession.</p><p>Still, higher interest rates make banks' bread-and-butter business of lending more profitable. Banks faced paltry lending profits for much of the pandemic after the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero in an effort to support a faltering economy.</p><p>Wells Fargo's net interest income, a measure of lending profit, rose 5% to $9.22 billion.</p><p>The bank's management in January estimated that net interest income could increase as much as 8% if the Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times in 2022. Investors now expect between nine and 10 quarter-point rate increases by the end of the year, according to CME Group.</p><p>Earnings Season</p><p>More WSJ coverage of businesses' financial results.</p><p>* JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Says 'Powerful Forces' Threaten U.S. Economy</p><p>* BlackRock Profit Increases 20% on Tech and Fees</p><p>* Delta Says Travel Rebound Is Keeping Pace With Surging Fuel Costs</p><p>Write to Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Wells Fargo Quarterly Profit Falls 21%</p>",
