  "title": "U.S. News: Gasoline Tops $5 a Gallon, Deepening Price Pain",
  "text": "<p>Gasoline prices skyrocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, with traders, shippers and financiers shunning Russian oil supplies. Oil inventories, which were already tight because of higher demand from economic reopening, have depleted even more, with no sign of relief ahead.</p><p>That has translated to pain at the pump, further squeezing Americans' household budgets already hit by higher prices on everything from items at the grocery store to restaurant meals and air travel. Prices for energy jumped 34.6% from a year earlier, while the cost of groceries rose 11.9%.</p><p>Shenetha James, a mother of four in Jackson, Miss., hasn't seen her eldest daughter, who lives about 700 miles away in North Carolina, since Christmas, because of high gasoline prices. \"It's been kind of hard,\" Ms. James said, \"not being able to really be there.\"</p><p>The average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline in Mississippi was still below the national average Sunday, at about $4.52, according to OPIS, which is part of Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Ms. James, who works for the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services, drives one child to basketball practice and another to work at Chick-fil-A a few times a week. After dropping them off, to save money on gasoline, Ms. James waits in a parking lot instead of driving back home.</p><p>\"We've got to manage this gas to get from one pay period to another,\" she said.</p><p>A report from JPMorgan last month said prices could jump to an average $6.20 a gallon by August. The cost of gasoline has already exceeded that price in California, where it was about $6.43 on average Sunday, according to OPIS.</p><p>\"People are still fueling up, despite these high prices,\" said Andrew Gross, a spokesman at AAA. \"At some point, drivers may change their daily driving habits or lifestyle due to these high prices, but we are not there yet.\" AAA, an automobile organization, obtains data from OPIS.</p><p>Some drivers are purchasing fewer gallons on each visit to gas stations but making more frequent trips to fuel up. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy, said consumer resilience has remained relatively strong, even as demand has started to waver. He projects people will more significantly adjust their driving habits when it hits between $5.40 and $5.50. That is around the price that, adjusted for inflation, would surpass the 2008 peak, Mr. De Haan said.</p><p>Chris Stevenson, a 24-year-old from New Jersey, said he's just going to ignore the prices for as long as possible. \"I don't care about the gas. I'm doing a lot of trips,\" he said while filling up at a Manhattan gas station Friday afternoon. The average price in New York City was about $5.20 a gallon on Sunday, according to OPIS.</p><p>Pandemic-related strains have added pressure on prices. Refineries around the world closed some plants after Covid-19-related lockdowns and travel restrictions dragged down fuel demand. Now, as demand hovers closer to prepandemic levels, the shortage of online refineries is exasperating the market and contributing to high gasoline prices.</p><p>Scott Solis, a 51-year-old resident of Goodyear, Ariz., who lives on a fixed income, said he has limited his trips to grocery and retail stores because of high gasoline prices.</p><p>He added that he used to go on sightseeing driving trips to Sedona and Flagstaff with his wife and friends. The average cost of a gallon of gasoline in Arizona was $5.31 Sunday. \"There's no way in heck we can do that now,\" Mr. Solis said.</p><p>---</p><p>Ginger Adams Otis contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
