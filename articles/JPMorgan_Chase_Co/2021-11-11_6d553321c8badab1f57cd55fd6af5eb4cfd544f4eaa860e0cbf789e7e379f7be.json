  "title": "China  Bonds  Sold at  Negative  Yield  ----  By Frances Yoon",
  "text": "<p>   China sold about $4.6 billion of bonds denominated in euros, taking advantage of superlow yields in the eurozone to raise shorter-term funds at negative rates for the second year running. </p><p>   China's finance ministry sold 1.5 billion euros, the equivalent of $1.7 billion, of three-year notes priced to yield minus 0.192%, a term sheet showed. It also sold the same amount of seven-year debt with a positive yield of 0.216% and 1 billion euros, or about $1.15 billion, of 12-year bonds yielding 0.759%. </p><p>   \"There is very strong demand out of Europe, particularly for the longer-dated tranche,\" said Alexander von-zur-Muehlen, chief executive for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank. </p><p>   \"It is clear that as China's fixed-income markets, already the second largest in the world, continue opening up, European investor interest and allocation is growing,\" he said in emailed comments. </p><p>   The appetite for Chinese sovereign debt denominated in euros is mirrored by rising international holdings of bonds that Beijing issues domestically in its own currency. </p><p>   Yuan-denominated Chinese government bonds have been added to indexes compiled by FTSE Russell, Bloomberg LP and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and global investors have increased their holdings in recent years. </p><p>   The debt offers a premium over even-more-negative benchmark European government debt, which helps to explain the investor interest. </p><p>   Three-year German government notes yielded about minus 0.733% as of Wednesday, according to Refinitiv. </p><p>   This is the third straight year that China has issued bonds in both dollars and euros in the fall. </p><p>   Unlike in the two previous years, this time the sale of euro bonds is bigger than its dollar equivalent, Deutsche Bank noted. </p><p>   Asian governments and companies have typically found it easier to raise money in the world's huge dollar-denominated bond markets than in euros. </p><p>   China's $4 billion dollar-bond sale last month also drew strong demand from international investors, despite data showing the country's economic growth slowed to 4.9% year over year in the third quarter, down from 7.9% in the previous three months. </p><p>   China hired 12 banks, including Chinese, U.S. and European institutions, last week to manage the euro bond sale. </p><p></p>",
