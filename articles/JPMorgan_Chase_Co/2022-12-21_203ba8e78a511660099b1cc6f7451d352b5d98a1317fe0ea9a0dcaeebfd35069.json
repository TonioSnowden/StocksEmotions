  "title": "Wells Fargo Shares Keep Rolling; Despite the bank's regulatory settlement this week, the stock remains among the least-bad performers in the sector",
  "text": "<p>Still, the net impact of the additional expense will likely be manageable. Before this week, analysts' consensus net income forecast was about $4.8 billion for the fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Wells said that the expense would be approximately $2.8 billion after-tax. So it is likely that Wells can remain profitable in the quarter.</p><p>One thing to watch will be the next update for the bank's range of reasonably possible losses related to legal actions in excess of accruals. That had been $3.7 billion at the high end as of Sept. 30. Analysts at Jefferies said they don't expect this number to go to zero in the next update, but hoped it \"would decline somewhatâ€¦given the magnitude\" of the CFPB settlement.</p><p>Earnings uncertainty is never good. But Wells Fargo is different from some of its U.S. megabank peers in that it is not facing an increase in its capital requirements next year due to a higher global systemic risk score, and therefore has a relatively sizable capital cushion. Its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio in the third quarter was 10.3%, and it will face a 9.2% regulatory minimum as of the fourth quarter that isn't set to jump in the first quarter of next year.</p><p>As Wells Fargo has been operating under the Federal Reserve's penalty asset cap throughout the pandemic, it hasn't faced the same pressure of expanding size that is helping to strain other banks' capital ratios. Other banks have had to take action recently to limit risk-weighted asset growth.</p><p>Plus, Wells remains quite positively exposed to higher interest rates. This in part reflects its tilt toward relatively sticky retail deposits, and not being in a position to swell its balance sheet with fast-moving excess wholesale deposits during the pandemic. Bank figures compiled by Jefferies analysts showed that as of the end of September, Wells would get a 16% bump to earnings-per-share from a 1 percentage point rise across the interest rate curve, the highest percentage boost among the largest banks.</p><p>These factors have helped keep Wells Fargo shares among the top performers in a tough year for bank stocks, despite the lingering regulatory clouds. The shares have dropped around 14% year-to-date, versus a 25% decline for the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, along the way outperforming Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, as well as U.S.-focused peers PNC Financial Services and U.S. Bancorp.</p><p>Wells Fargo's Washington issues might seem to linger, but that doesn't mean the stock is also stuck.</p><p>Write to Telis Demos at Telis.Demos@wsj.com</p><p>Wells Fargo Shares Keep Rolling</p>",
