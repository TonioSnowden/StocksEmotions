  "text": "<p>Expanded child tax credits, which provided a reliable boost to Americans' wallets on the 15th of every month, ended a month ago. Those payments, which expanded both the size and eligibility of child tax credits, provided up to $300 per child a month, reviving retail sales that had slowed after Americans stopped receiving stimulus checks.</p><p>In total, those monthly child-tax-credit payments boosted consumers' wallets by a collective $16 billion a month on average, according to a research note from J.P. Morgan. That is roughly double what Americans spend on electronics and in appliances stores monthly.</p><p>At the moment, a revival of those payments hangs by a thin thread in Congress, meaning retailers should brace for a rocky start to the year.</p><p>Last year, there was a noticeable drop in retail sales between April, a month after consumers received their last federal stimulus checks, and July, when monthly child-tax-credit payments kicked in. It wasn't a seasonal effect, either: Even in years preceding the pandemic, sales tended to rise during the April-July window.</p><p>Once those child-tax-credit payments kicked in starting mid-July, retail sales picked up. Spending on apparel and in department stores, in particular, saw a big uptick in the days immediately following the first distribution on July 15, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.</p><p>Tax-refund season typically gives retailers a separate uplift because consumers tend to spend the windfall on big-ticket items. AutoZone Chief Executive Officer Bill Rhodes said in an earnings call last month that any period with a tax refund resulted in a \"big spike\" in business. This year, that isn't a sure thing.</p><p>The expanded child tax credits meant that families got half of the credits they would have otherwise claimed on their 2021 tax return in advance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Americans' personal savings rate had dropped to pre-pandemic levels by November.</p><p>With that in mind, the interlude before major retailers report their results is a good time for investors to ponder just how hot retail stocks have been. The S&amp;P 500 retailing index's enterprise value as a multiple of forward revenue is 13% higher than its five-year average.</p><p>After outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by roughly 30 percentage points last year, both Home Depot and Lowe's sport enterprise values as multiples of their respective forward sales near 10-year highs. Dollar General, which has higher exposure to low-income consumers, is trading at a multiple that is 28% above its five-year average.</p><p>Investors in U.S. retail stocks are primed for optimism after a string of pleasant surprises last year, but caution is warranted now. Shoppers might have a lot less to spend as 2022 kicks off.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
