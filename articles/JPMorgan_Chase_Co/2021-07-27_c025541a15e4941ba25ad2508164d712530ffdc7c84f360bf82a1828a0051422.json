Electric-car maker Tesla reported record earnings after the closing bell. Apple, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet are on deck later this week. All four stocks traded modestly higher.</p><p>This week is really where we enter crunchtime for earnings,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"With tech names reporting, the bar is high.\"</p><p>Rising concerns over the Delta variant of Covid-19 and worries over economic growth are likely to challenge the pace at which the U.S. stock market will rise in the coming weeks, some investors say. Money managers also are awaiting guidance from the Federal Reserve this week, including policy makers' outlook on inflation and any clues on when the central bank may start scaling back its bond purchases.</p><p>\"Economic activity in the U.S. does seem to have peaked,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. \"We're still in very benign territory where the economy is still powering ahead but not at the full elastic bounce back.\"</p><p>The market actually may be reflecting more of that than it seems, said JC Parets, the founder of technical-analysis service AllStarCharts. The records for the big indexes are coming from a small group of stocks, which happen to be the largest. Underneath that, he said, the picture is much choppier.</p><p>Global markets initially soured after Beijing took aim at some of China's rapidly growing listed companies over the weekend, prompting a sharp selloff and fueling concerns about regulatory risks.

Food e-commerce platform Pinduoduo dropped 8.8% to $88.71, online retailer JD.com shed 8.6% to $66.08 and gaming company NetEase dropped 14% to $89.40.</p><p>In other action, shares of Aon rallied 8.2% to $251.56 after the company and Willis Towers Watson agreed to terminate their roughly $30 billion deal and end litigation with the U.S. Justice Department. Willis Towers Watson shares fell 9% to $206.07.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked lower to 1.276% from 1.286% Friday.
