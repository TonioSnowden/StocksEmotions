  "text": "<p>Coinbase revenue fell in the third quarter by more than 40% from the previous three months, as cryptocurrency trading volumes. Coinbase, which offers a signature platform for trading crypto, felt the pain of users not trading to the same levels of previous months.</p><p>“The story of our third quarter really centers around lower volatility that we saw in the quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said in a conference call Tuesday. “Our monthly transaction users and trading volumes and therefore transaction fee revenue all correlate with volatility. So it's a very important driver of our financials.”</p><p>Coinbase's COIN financials did not live up to expectations. The company reported third-quarter earnings of $405.3 million, or $1.62 a share, up from $81.3 million in profit in the same quarter a year ago, before the crypto-trading platform went public. Total revenue grew to $1.31 billion from $286.7 million a year ago, but declined sequentially from $2.23 billion in the second quarter, while transaction revenue totaled $1.09 billion, down from $1.93 billion in the second quarter.</p><p>Also read:Coinbase CEO anticipates planned NFT marketplace more akin to Instagram than eBay</p><p>Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.82 a share on sales of $1.61 billion, with transaction revenue accounting for $1.31 billion, according to FactSet. Coinbase shares dove 13% in the after-hours trading session, after closing with a 1% increase at $357.39, a closing record for the stock.</p><p>Analysts largely expected Coinbase revenue to decline from the second quarter, the platform's first full period as a public company. They tracked a decline in crypto-trading activity in the second quarter, especially July, and Square Inc. SQseemed to confirm that trend in its earnings report late last week.</p><p>See also: Everything you need to know about Coinbase as a public company</p><p>“While July was particularly slow, activity levels picked up in August and further in September,” JP Morgan analysts wrote in a preview of the earnings report this week. “Thus far, October has been active for cryptocurrency trading, not unexpected given heavy news flow and token appreciation.”</p><p>The analysts, who maintained their overweight rating and modestly increased their price target to $375 from $372 in the note, posited that Coinbase has held up better than the industry overall amid the decline, with volumes dipping about 25% for Coinbase while the larger crypto-trading volumes declined closer to 40%.</p><p>Coinbase executives guided for just such a decline in its second-quarter results, predicting three months ago that monthly transacting users, or MTUs, “and total trading volume will be lower in Q3 as compared to Q2.” However, it seemed that a steeper decline in retail transaction revenue compared with retail trading volume — 38% vs. 44% — took a bigger bite out of net revenue than expected.</p><p>“3Q saw a dramatic decline in the retail take rate, likely amongst the most dramatic compression in Coinbase's short history as a public company,” Mizuho analysts wrote after the results hit. “This helped drive the significant (nearly 20%) ‘miss' in revenue vs. consensus expectations.”</p><p>CFO Haas directly addressed these questions in Tuesday's conference call.</p><p>“We want to be clear — There was no change to our retail transaction fee rates in the quarter,” she said. “The decline that you see is the result of math. It is a result of the facts that in low volatility periods, we see our low dollar volume traders become less active. We've seen this transaction reversed in October.”</p><p>In Tuesday's forecast, Coinbase executives said that October's numbers were much higher than what they reported for the third quarter — 11.7 million MTUs and $186 billion in monthly trading volume — and bluntly said, “We believe that retail MTUs and total trading volume will be higher in Q4 as compared to Q3.”</p><p>Coinbase's annual forecast calls for MTUs of 8 million to 8.5 million, and average annual net transaction revenue per user each month in the high $50s.</p><p>For the third quarter, Coinbase reported 7.4 million monthly transacting users, while analysts on average were expecting 6.85 million. Overall trading volume was $327 billion, down from $462 billion in the previous quarter, with bitcoin BTCUSD volume comprising 19% of that total, ethereum ETHUSD comprising 22%, and other crypto assets taking up the other 59%, the largest percentage of volume dedicated to non-bitcoin and -ether offerings Coinbase has reported.</p><p>Read: The reasons for crypto's record rally to $3 trillion, as bitcoin and ether hit new highs</p><p>Coinbase shares sold for $381 when they entered the public market through a direct listing in April and topped $400 in that session, but the price has yet to return to those heights. Shares posted all-time closing highs in the past two sessions in a row, however.</p>",
