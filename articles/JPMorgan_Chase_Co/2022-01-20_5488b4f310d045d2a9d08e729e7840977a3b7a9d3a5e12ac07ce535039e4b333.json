  "title": "Citi targets Big Oil in biggest step among major banks on climate change",
  "text": "<p>CitiC said Wednesday in a report that it aims for an “absolute reduction” in emissions from companies across its energy loan portfolio of 29% by 2030 from 2020. Citi did stress that dropping oil and gas clients if they are deemed to fall short of such targets would only be a last resort.</p><p>Other banks have focused on pushing clients to reduce their “emissions intensity,” a measure of emissions relative to output, instead of just emissions in general, which “absolute reduction” targets. Some climate activists argue that emissions intensity is a softer metric that does not go far enough if global warming is going to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Citi did keep the “emissions intensity” language in its call for the power sector, targeting a 63% reduction in emissions intensity for borrowers across that sector. Some analysts have said a mix of energy sources — ranging from natural gasNG00 to nuclear to wind and solar and the more experimental and not-yet-scalable green hydrogen — will be needed in the transition years as EVs and other electric sources put added demand on the nation's grid.</p><p>Citi repeated in the report its aim to achieve net-zero carbon emissions associated with its financing by 2050, a marker similar to most pledges in the financial-services space.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;‘Net zero' pledges can amount to greenwashing. This is the better way to reduce deadly carbon emission</p><p>The financial sector has been accused of “greenwashing” by some environmental groups and lawmakers, who suggest that broad pledges — including cutting emissions at their own banking centers — carry little water when a funding pipeline continues to keep fossil-fuel firms pumping oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels accounted for&#xa0;74%&#xa0;of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, the most recent year for complete data, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Major banks, including JPMorgan ChaseJPM, Bank of AmericaBAC and Citi, have invested $3.8 trillion in fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement targeting global warming was signed in 2015, at least through early last year, according to tracking by a handful of climate organizations, including the Rainforest Action Network.</p><p>Related:JPMorgan Chase — the oil industry's bank of choice — will withdraw support for some fossil fuels</p><p>But banking leaders have said regulators must go slow and avoid one-size-fits-all treatment when it comes to proposed climate-change and energy-sector financing rules. Sudden disruption to the energy sector poses bigger risks to the economy, they argue.</p><p>Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said at a major U.N. climate conference late last year that lack of financing for oil and gas could push these concerns to seek more private capital, bringing less investor and regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Read:Wall Street could crumble under the weight of a ‘carbon bubble,' these groups warn</p><p>“We will continue to assess our client relationships — a regular part of how we manage our business — and prioritize partnering on transition strategies before turning to client exits as a last resort,” Citi CEO Jane Fraser said.</p><p>The company is also monitoring the impact on developing countries, where there may be limited access to energy resources, Fraser said.&#xa0;</p><p>Citi has also&#xa0;vowed&#xa0;to finance $1 trillion in sustainable business in coming years.&#xa0;</p><p>Read: Citigroup profit falls but beats Wall Street target</p><p>Citigroup shares are up about 1.6% over the past year, compared with a 12% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA over the same span. One popular energy-sector exchange-traded fund, the SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETFXOP is up 89% over the past year.</p>",
