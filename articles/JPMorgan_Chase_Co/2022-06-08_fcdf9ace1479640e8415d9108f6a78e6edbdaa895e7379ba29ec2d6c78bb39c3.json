  "text": "<p>The pain in the US municipal debt market has finally started to subside after the worst start to the year in four decades, as cheap bond prices and fears about a slowing economy coax investors back. </p> <p>This year to late May, investors pulled $57bn out of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/b91ccb39-9d52-487d-90b0-7f9332be1a33\">municipal mutual bond </a>funds, according to EPFR data. The sell-off drove returns in the first quarter to negative 6.2 per cent, as measured by the Bloomberg municipal bond index, the worst quarterly performance since 1981. Losses persisted in April. </p> <p>The market began to recover last month, with returns now up 3.6 per cent from a three-year low hit on May 18. Last week so-called muni funds recorded their first net inflows since January, albeit only of $36mn.</p> <p>Cities and states issue municipal bonds to fund spending on projects from airports to hospitals to roads. The $4tn market is typically popular with wealthier investors because the revenue generated by munis is tax exempt. </p> <p>Investors had pulled out of muni bonds because of concerns about the effects of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7982616a-e179-45f1-86f6-948f1fc35523\">inflation</a> and rising interest rates. But the sell-off drew bargain hunters. </p> <p>At last month's lows, munis offered nearly as much yield as comparable corporate debt, but with far less risk. Municipal government issuers are less likely to default than companies during a recession, which some economists view as increasingly likely. </p> <p>“It has been a remarkable turnaround,” said Peter Cramer, a portfolio manager at Sun Life Capital Management, who had recommended his firm's clients, primarily insurance companies, to enter the market. </p> <p>“I think we're headed for a recessionary environment, and if that's the case, municipals tend to be an area that you're better off being in.”</p> <p>Returns on US Treasury bonds also typically improve in a downturn as investors seek out their safety. Munis benefit from the same trend, but may be more attractive than Treasuries because they currently offer a higher yield on an after-tax basis, for slightly more risk. </p> <p>The fund manager Franklin Templeton is forecasting that munis will outperform Treasuries in the second quarter. Pimco, the fixed-income manager, said it expects munis to outperform Treasuries over the course of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle. </p> <p>A shortage of muni bond supply this summer is also expected to keep prices elevated. </p> <p>“While there could be some modest pullback after recent muni market gains, the month of June ushers in strong summer technicals with net-negative supply in June, July and August,” said Peter DeGroot, head of muni research at JPMorgan. “This is expected to largely preserve the municipal market rally.” </p> <p>Their appeal has been enough to draw in investors that aren't typically interested in munis, such as hedge funds and non-US buyers, said Jim Conn, a muni portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton. While those investors don't always stick around, their interest “really lays the footing for a protracted period of buying”.&#xa0;</p> <p>That demand has been evident in the primary market, where new offerings are made. Late in May, appetite for its $200mn muni issue led the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation to reduce its yield offering by 0.25 percentage points, said Eve Lando, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. The deal was ultimately 10 times oversubscribed.</p> <p>In the past two weeks, muni deals have been roughly six to seven times oversubscribed, said Lando, compared with one to two times earlier this year. </p> <p>Strengthening the balance sheets of many issuers were record tax receipts in 2021 and federal Covid-19 aid to cities and states. The credit rating of the state of Illinois — which was flirting with insolvency at the onset of the pandemic because of pension liabilities and declining tax revenue — was upgraded in April. </p> <p>For some upgraded issuers, questions persist over “their ability to generate tax revenue long term, and you look at their budgets which in some instances are structurally imbalanced”, said Jonathan Mondillo, head of municipals at Abrdn. “I think it is important for investors to look through the rating agency upgrades that we've seen recently.” </p><p>Source: Kate Duguid in New York 2022 'Bleeding stops in US muni bonds as investors seek slowdown protection' FT.com 8 June.
