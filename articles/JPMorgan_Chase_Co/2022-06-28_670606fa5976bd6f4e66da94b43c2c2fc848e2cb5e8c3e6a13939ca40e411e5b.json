In particular, France wants to explore ways of bringing production from Venezuela and Iran, both subject to US sanctions, back on the market.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Read more:</strong> Gideon Rachman argues <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb6fa1f-27a8-4674-a19b-c17a48333eb9\">why he thinks the US could be the real winner</a> in the energy wars.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks to all the readers who voted in yesterday's poll.
