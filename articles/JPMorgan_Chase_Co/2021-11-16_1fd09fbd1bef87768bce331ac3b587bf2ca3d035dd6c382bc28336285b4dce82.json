  "title": "Musk Sells More Stock; JPMorgan Sues Tesla",
  "text": "<p>Separately, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. on Monday filed suit against Tesla alleging breach of contract over stock warrants that came due this year. The financial institution said it was seeking to recover more than $162 million through the case filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Mr. Musk likely would need to sell more than 9 million additional shares, following his sales Monday and based on his total holdings as of earlier this month. The precise number depends on how he defines his ownership stake.</p><p>Mr. Musk on Monday also exercised over 2.1 million stock options valued at roughly $2.1 billion as of Monday's closing price, while surrendering around 786 million of those shares to cover expenses linked to the transaction.</p><p>Tesla's stock fell 1.9% Monday. The stock has slumped around 17% since Mr. Musk began selling shares.</p><p>JPMorgan says Tesla was required to deliver the bank shares or cash if the price of the stock was above the warrants strike price at the time the contract between the companies expired, which was the case.</p><p>The dispute over the warrants is complicated by Mr. Musk's assertion in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, only for him to reverse the statement soon after. The original assertion led the Securities and Exchange Commission to sue Mr. Musk for fraud, leading to several actions against the Tesla boss, including his relinquishing the role of Tesla chairman.</p><p>JP Morgan twice repriced the options over the episode, a move Tesla challenged as unreasonable at the time. The bank rejected Tesla's complaint, the legal filing states, and argued its moves to adjust warrant prices were contractually required. Tesla's stock price at the time the warrant expired this year was both above the original and adjusted strike price, the bank says in the filing.</p><p>Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the case.</p>",
