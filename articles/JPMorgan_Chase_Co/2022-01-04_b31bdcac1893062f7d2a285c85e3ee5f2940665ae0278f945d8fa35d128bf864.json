  "text": "<p>As US shoppers count the cost of their last-minute holiday purchases, there is one thing they have to worry about a little less in 2022: overdraft fees. </p> <p>Consumer advocates said last year saw the most significant rollbacks and adjustments to how banks charge customers when their debit accounts fall below zero.</p> <p>Those fees “may be the single most unpopular thing banks do to their customers”, said Jesse Van Tol, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a consumer advocacy group. “I think you're just really seeing a tipping point this year.”&#xa0;</p> <p>A host of US banks have made changes to their overdraft policies. Examples include PNC, the seventh-largest US bank by assets, which lowered fees and gave customers a longer grace period to cover an overdraft, and Capital One, which in December said it was scrapping overdraft fees altogether. </p> <p>JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank, also announced changes to its overdraft policy last month, including providing customers with a day to catch up on their payments, adding to measures the bank had taken in earlier years. </p> <p>“We perform customer research consistently throughout the year and we're looking at the competitive landscape,” Steve Goodman, head of product for consumer banking at JPMorgan, told the Financial Times. “We put all of that together to continuously evolve our products and services, whether it's overdraft or other things.”</p> <p>Overdraft fees became a focal point during a US Senate banking hearing in May, when Elizabeth Warren, a leader of the progressive wing of the Democratic party, tussled with Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan, over the charges. Warren urged Dimon and his fellow bank chiefs to refund the fees to customers.</p> <p>Warren's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTKzst_dNE&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision\">exchange</a> with Dimon — during which she called JPMorgan the “star of the overdraft show” for how much it collected in fees — drew renewed attention to the issue. Shortly after the exchange, Utah-based digital lender Ally Bank announced it would do away with overdraft fees. </p> <p>Rohit Chopra, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44043a25-16ea-48c0-862f-71de8472d0ff\">new director</a>, has also taken a muscular stance on the issue, including a direction to the consumer watchdog to scrutinise banks that are heavily reliant on these fees. </p> <p>Smaller banks that focus on consumer banking typically get a larger percentage of their revenue from overdraft fees compared with large banks with more diversified business lines. </p> <p>“Rather than competing on transparent, upfront pricing, large financial institutions are still hooked on exploitative junk fees that can quickly drain a family's bank account,” Chopra said in a statement last month. </p> <p>There has also been competitive pressure on banks from fintech challengers such as Chime, which have made overdraft-free accounts the cornerstone of their marketing campaigns. That “became something in the mindset of consumers that made fintech better than banks”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2541c590-cba4-4240-b67d-0916dfc122d1\">Bill Demchak</a>, chair and chief executive of PNC, told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>US banks earned an estimated $15.47bn from overdraft fees in 2019, a figure that has remained fairly steady from previous years, according to the most recent figures available from the CFPB. </p> <p>Capital One, the largest US retail bank to scrap the fees, estimated that its decision will cost it about $150m annually, which was 0.5 per cent of its revenues for all of 2020. </p> <p>The benefits of eliminating those fees might outweigh the loss. Banks and fintechs that have announced new overdraft policies are acquiring customers at twice the rate of financial institutions that have not, according to Curinos, a research firm that focuses on the financial services industry.</p> <p>“Economically, it's a good trade,” said Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking at Citizens Financial, which rolled out more forgiving overdraft policies in October.</p> <p>Since making the changes to its policies last year, PNC customers charged $500m worth of purchases that put their accounts into overdraft and ultimately did not end up incurring fees.</p> <p>“Not surprisingly our customer complaints have fallen by more than half — and it has to help through the holiday season,” Demchak said. </p> <p>Though many of the largest US retail banks announced overdraft policies over the past year, most stopped short of waiving the fees completely. Proponents have argued there is a use-case for the fees as a product and banks should be compensated for extending what is essentially an unsecured loan.</p> <p>“The business rationale is that you are not in the business of making loans with zero interest rates. Banks are supposed to earn a return on capital,” said Betsy Graseck, global head of banks and diversified financials research at Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>At issue, however, is ensuring any fees are transparent and manageable for those charged, particularly given that many account holders going into overdraft are lower-income customers who live pay cheque to pay cheque, consumer advocates said. </p> <p>Government pressure is essential to ensure overdraft fees become less common and are more transparent, said David Silberman, senior adviser at Washington-based Center for Responsible Lending and a former acting deputy director for the CFPB.</p> <p>“Left to [its] own devices,” said Silberman, “I don't think we can assume the market is going to fundamentally change.”</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise in New York 2022 'US banks move away from overdraft fees in a win for consumers' FT.com 4 January.
