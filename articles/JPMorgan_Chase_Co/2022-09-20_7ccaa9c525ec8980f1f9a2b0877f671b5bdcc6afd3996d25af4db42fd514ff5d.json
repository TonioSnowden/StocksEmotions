  "title": "Stocks Rise Ahead of Key Fed Meeting --- Yield on 10-year Treasury note soars to highest level in more than a decade",
  "text": "<p>Last week, both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq notched their biggest weekly declines since June amid a slew of corporate warnings that raised alarm bells about the trajectory of the U.S. economy. Companies such as FedEx and General Electric were among those that pointed to signs of economic troubles. The messages sparked worries among investors about how well corporate earnings can hold up as the Fed keeps raising rates and the U.S. potentially heads for a recession.</p><p>This week, investors are largely focused on a round of interest-rate decisions by central banks. The Fed's decision, to be announced Wednesday, will be followed Thursday by the Bank of England.</p><p>Investors sold government bonds in the run-up to the Fed meeting, sending yields to their highest level in years.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 3.489%, its highest 3 p.m. ET settlement level since 2011, and up from 3.447% on Friday. The two-year yield, which is much more sensitive to near-term interest-rate expectations, climbed to 3.946%, its highest settlement since 2007, up from 3.859% on Friday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Futures markets on Monday afternoon showed that traders estimate an 82% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point and an 18% chance that the U.S. central bank will lift rates by a full percentage point, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"We're afraid that the Fed could surprise us with another jumbo hike,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Last week's corporate warnings, he said, suggested \"we very well could be at the entry point of the U.S. recession.\"</p><p>Still, analysts at JPMorgan suggested in a research note on Monday that the market may have hit bottom after last week's selloff.</p><p>Due to the resilience of corporate earnings, deep pessimism in investor positioning and signs that the Fed may have succeeded in tempering inflation expectations, \"any downside from here would be limited,\" they wrote.</p><p>Nine of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors ended the day with gains. Healthcare was one of the sectors that posted losses, weighed down by losses among vaccine makers.</p><p>Moderna tumbled $9.84, or 7.1%, to $127.90, making it the worst-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500, after President Biden said in a televised interview that the Covid-19 pandemic was over. Novavax fell $1.98, or 6.5%, to $28.43, while Pfizer shed 59 cents, or 1.3%, to $45.44.</p><p>Later this week, investors will parse results from companies including Costco Wholesale and home builder Lennar. They also will get full results from FedEx on Thursday after its sales warning last week.</p><p>Futures on Brent crude, the benchmark for global oil prices, bounced back from sharp losses earlier in the session and gained 0.7% to settle at $92 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped less than 0.1%. Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.1% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.2%.</p>",
