The EMA has not changed its guidance for the jab, saying its benefits outweigh the risks.</p> <p>The move comes as the global demand for vaccines is rising sharply, with Joe Biden promising every adult in America will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ca9c24d-a824-4efb-b5d7-2cb4d2a2a086\">eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine</a> by mid-April as he seeks to meet his pledge to oversee 200m shots in his first 100 days.</p> <p>The <strong>Serum Institute</strong> of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, has said it will resume exports of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in June but only if domestic coronavirus cases decline.</p> <p>The EU drug regulator is also to launch an investigation next week into whether clinical trials of Russia's <strong>Sputnik V</strong> Covid-19 vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50031165-1f46-446b-be9a-36d553805fec\">contravened ethical and scientific&#xa0;standards</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, also in the UK, a fresh study showed one in three people who have suffered from Covid-19 was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/beb407c0-03a3-4aae-ba4b-7f66390d7409\">diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition</a> within six months of infection.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Most <strong>advanced economies</strong> will emerge from the coronavirus crisis with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3d04ff2-89f9-457c-806a-8618c8516580\">little lasting damage</a>, thanks to the relatively rapid rollout of vaccines and their willingness to increase sharply public spending and borrowing, according to the IMF. It forecast two years of rapid growth in 2021 and 2022, of 6 per cent and 4.4 per cent for the global economy, but significantly lower in emerging economies.</p> <p><br>Slower vaccination rollouts and a fresh wave of infections in some countries will result in “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af5f24e8-d22a-443d-94c1-ec405301000e\">sharply divergent growth prospects</a>”, according to the <strong>Brookings-FT tracking index</strong>. Mark Lowcock, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, has called for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e6a02e2-c3e4-4fd6-aa08-910bf3186f5b\">bolder measures</a> by the World Bank and IMF to offer more finance to lower income nations, write off debt and overhaul their models.</p> <p>Higher <strong>freight costs</strong> will fall after the pandemic, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6458318f-deb8-48c4-8d79-d73acb3401e3\">supply chain concerns</a> linked to geopolitical risk will remain, with vaccine nationalism, Brexit and US-China tensions reflecting a political environment that has become more hostile to global trade. Meeting new due diligence standards and diversifying supply chains will raise prices. “We should expect to see lower levels of technological diffusion and productivity,” says Joanna Konings, senior economist at ING Bank.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>A huge rise in US government spending will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33c9577-0faf-424d-919e-68bda2052867\">boost the world's largest economy</a> over at least the next two years, the chief executive of <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> forecast. In his annual letter to shareholders, Jamie Dimon said high savings rates, stimulus programmes, a potential infrastructure package and “euphoria around the end of the pandemic” were likely to jump-start the US economy, while stressing his bank was also prepared for the possibility of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0bbed31-bea8-4542-b953-096762d2e59f\">runaway inflation</a>&#xa0;or another wave of lockdowns.</p> <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> has warned it will carry <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e86dc325-2e65-4097-bd51-adb16e0f3ef3\">fewer passengers than expected</a> over the next year and struggle to turn a profit because of the slow rollout of vaccinations across much of Europe. It forecasts passenger numbers in the year ending March 2022 towards the lower end of a previously guided range of between 80m and 120m. The chief executives of <strong>British Airways, Virgin Atlantic</strong> and <strong>Heathrow airport</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d1e7e19-50ab-4d9b-8839-483eb897597d\">called for a travel corridor with the US </a>to be opened as soon as next month, in a push to restart the industry's most lucrative routes.</p> <p>Government restrictions make it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6e94646-b9fc-4ddd-95c5-c59785f7da53\">difficult to run a profitable restaurant in Tokyo</a>, but tough lease terms in Japan's real estate market make it prohibitively expensive to close them down. The country's service industry has borne the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8dc75fbe-faf4-4bdc-b96f-20417ea2f0a7\">economic brunt</a>&#xa0;of the government's Covid-19 strategy, with neither customers nor&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2501fe67-2965-45c7-8b08-35494bd75f6f\">adequate compensation</a>&#xa0;for compulsory closures, creating cracks in its famous social solidarity.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>The quickening US economic recovery has markets pricing in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d3af68a-f25f-4cd5-902d-2b1c21b8cadb\">a Federal Reserve rate rise as soon as next year</a>, but analysts warn this accelerated timetable is far too “aggressive”. Eurodollar futures, a closely tracked measure of <strong>interest rate</strong> expectations, now indicate the Fed will initiate lift-off by the end of 2022, with three additional interest rate increases pencilled in by early 2024.</p> <p>After an extended period of central bank support — led by the Fed — buoyed <strong>bonds</strong>, investor sentiment is turning. John Redwood, chief global strategist for Charles Stanley, argues that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9daabf95-7775-4eb3-9fbf-216c2d6e101b\">growing worries about US inflation</a> and the large new American bond issue programme could hit prices further.</p> <p>Bonds issued by some of the companies hit hardest by coronavirus, including cruise operator <strong>Carnival Corporation</strong>, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2de01274-bf03-4788-ab94-c26189b9baea\">rallied vigorously over the past year</a>, rewarding investors who were prepared to gamble they would survive. It is only the third time in history that the rolling 12-month return for the market has exceeded 20 per cent, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Jenkins comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97ade001-8df2-41af-bef2-c28507293cc2?commentID=d7eba560-9367-478e-a6a7-594ae090ee8c\">Covid has been a catastrophe. Can it also be an opportunity?</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>The first thing to be cheerful about is that it could have been so much worse. It arrived at a time when the tech mostly worked, the financial system was mostly solid (after GFC repairs) and interest rates were rock bottom. </p>  <p>The next thing is that it has brought out the best in many people and (I think one should say) some institutions. Not all of either, however.</p>  <p>It has also shown us that the people we most rely on when the chips are down are not the titans, the liberal professions or the better paid. Can we try to remember that?</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2d8107d-e198-4c7a-8dbe-5c6d2d0755ad\"><em>Monet and Impressionist Masterpieces</em></a>, an exhibition just launched at Bund One Art Museum, Shanghai, is “a triumph of art, diplomacy and sheer practical agility overcoming pandemic cultural paralysis”, writes Jackie Wullschläger. When lockdown shut Paris museums last spring at the moment when cities in China were beginning to emerge from the pandemic, Marianne Mathieu, head curator at the Musée Marmottan, saw beyond local restrictions to global opportunity and sent paintings to China. </p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
