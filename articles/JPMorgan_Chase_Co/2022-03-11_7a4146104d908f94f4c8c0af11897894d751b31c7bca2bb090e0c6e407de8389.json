  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>New data this morning showed the UK economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5baf3de4-918f-4bab-9844-45f89dcc1495\">bounced back</a> in January, driven by growth in the services sector, after a brief setback the previous month from the Omicron variant of coronavirus.</p> <p>GDP increased by a better than expected 0.8 per cent after shrinking 0.2 per cent in December, meaning the economy was now above its pre-pandemic level.</p> <p>However, the new figures have been “pushed into the rear-view mirror by renewed domestic and global shocks,” in the words of the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. </p> <p>As we reported yesterday, economists believe the surge in commodity prices that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine will worsen the UK's biggest squeeze on disposable incomes for 30 years and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28a13d3d-bfc1-4bc0-8fd6-360c9c797ae6\">reduce growth</a> as inflation peaks above 9 per cent. Hopes that consumer spending could drive growth are also fading. Some are drawing parallels with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e638e6a-2474-4b71-98f0-5183bfbac711\">Britain of the 1970s</a>. </p> <p>The UK has few direct economic links with Russia, which accounts for just 1.3 per cent of goods trade, 0.7 per cent of foreign investment, and, unlike for its EU peers, just 4 per cent of gas supplies. But Britain does buy energy and commodities in international markets, where prices are soaring. “The main impact . . . of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to be energy prices staying higher for longer,” said one economist. Food prices are also set to increase.</p> <p>The worsening outlook puts chancellor Rishi Sunak in a tight spot as he prepares his spring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7daa9b4-a8f4-4b05-a4ef-8dec5612f538\">economic statement</a> set for March 23. </p> <p>According to the IFS think-tank, he will need to find an extra £10bn to avoid a painful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/517956d8-eea6-450c-b962-009578f1d389\">pay squeeze</a> for public sector workers whose government pay settlement from last autumn is now being eroded by inflation. </p> <p>He faces calls to cancel upcoming tax rises as well as demands from his own party to increase defence spending. The one bright spot for him is better than expected public finances.</p> <p>The uncertainty around the conflict in Ukraine however means few economists are confident in their predictions, or as Investec economist Sandra Horsfield warned: “The longer the war lasts, and the bigger the sanctions on Russia are, the greater the hit to UK activity will be.” </p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Draghi says EU members agreed to strengthen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea9dd3fd-2257-4543-9cdb-ba5de7a005f8#post-c44f42d6-f165-4aad-9288-d91eafb2d5d5\">defence co-operation</a></p></li>  <li><p>US prepares to end <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/135f54b0-dfdc-4966-aea9-89ca04f3abab\">normal trade relations</a> with Russia</p></li>  <li><p>The UK <a href=\"https://ukcovid19inquiry.citizenspace.com/contribute/terms-of-reference-consultation/\">Covid-19 inquiry</a> to examine the country's pandemic response opens a consultation on its draft terms of reference</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea9dd3fd-2257-4543-9cdb-ba5de7a005f8\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> speeded up the withdrawal of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4667f92c-2237-4a3c-8d91-9884531d363d\">stimulus programme</a> as the Ukraine conflict fuelled expectations of higher inflation, but it gave itself more flexibility on when to raise interest rates.
