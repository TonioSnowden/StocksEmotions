  "text": "<p>Wall Street stocks rallied on Monday, as better than expected earnings from Bank of America and an abrupt U-turn on tax cuts from the UK government buoyed market sentiment.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.7 per cent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 3.4 per cent. In Europe, the regional Stoxx Europe 600 closed up 1.8 per cent and London's FTSE 100 advanced 0.9 per cent.</p> <p>US stocks rose after Bank of America's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4524281b-b18d-45e6-acb0-7d0532fba9e9\">third-quarter results</a> beat expectations, attributed to “resilient” US consumers. Expanding profit margins from consumer lending helped to temper falling investment banking revenues.</p> <p>Shares in the US bank rose more than 6 per cent, as it followed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4aa2c82e-e8af-4c94-9048-58862a5477bf\">JPMorgan Chase</a> in reporting a smaller than expected drop in profits.</p> <p>“We've been waiting for warnings from earnings and none of the forecasts so far have confirmed our worst fears,” said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading.</p> <p>Investors are watching corporate earnings closely for signs of strain from high inflation and rising borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 0.75 percentage points at each of its past three meetings, taking its target range to 3 to 3.25 per cent.</p> <p>Stocks were also buoyed on Monday after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4f8b0c9-1c45-464b-b7d1-c1c2d37311e6\">new UK chancellor</a> Jeremy Hunt abandoned the majority of his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's tax cuts. The reversal helped calm the gilts market and lifted the pound to its highest level in nearly two weeks. </p> <p>US markets have been moving in sympathy with the UK, in part because of British investors' holdings of US assets, but also because the UK crisis has spooked market participants who are watching vigilantly for any sign of stress.</p> <p>The UK government's “sincere apology” on its disruptive tax cuts supported the market on Monday, said Thomas Thygesen, head of strategy at SEB Research, who also cited robust third-quarter earnings reports for the rally.</p> <p>“From a broader perspective, you could say that all this has happened as we were ‘due' a break,” said Thygesen, after significant sell-offs in stock markets this year. This “could [lead to] some kind of stabilisation or even a bear rally for stocks while we wait for . . . lower earnings estimates”.</p> <p>The rally on Wall Street reversed declines in the previous session. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b10acc0-1b88-4006-92fd-0e1a7310722a\">tumbled on Friday</a>, with the latter gauge sliding more than 3 per cent after a downbeat survey of inflation expectations from the University of Michigan sparked fresh concerns about the Fed raising rates more aggressively into a slowing economy.</p> <p>Investors will analyse UK inflation data on Wednesday, with economists polled by Reuters expecting the consumer price index to have climbed 10 per cent in September — an acceleration from 9.9 per cent in August.</p> <p>A higher or lower than expected reading could trigger further moves in UK bond markets, which have swung by historic magnitudes in recent weeks after the “mini” Budget delivered on September 23.</p> <p>The pound rose 1.6 per cent against the dollar to $1.134. Sterling fell 1.4 per cent on Friday after UK prime minister Liz Truss sacked Kwarteng and abandoned a planned tax cut for corporations.</p> <p>Elsewhere in currencies, the Japanese yen weakened to ¥149.07 against the dollar, a 32-year low. The US dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of rivals, slipped 0.8 per cent. Through the end of last week, the dollar had risen 18 per cent in 2022 because of climbing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-interest-rates\">US interest rates</a> and its status as the world's reserve currency.</p> <p>In Asian equity markets, Japan's Topix index ended the day down 1 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed up 0.2 per cent.</p><p>Source: Ian Johnston in London and Kate Duguid in New York 2022 'Wall Street stocks rally as traders turn to corporate earnings' FT.com 17 October.
