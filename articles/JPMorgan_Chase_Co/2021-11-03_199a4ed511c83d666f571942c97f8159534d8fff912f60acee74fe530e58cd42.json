  "text": "<p>The Federal Reserve concluded its two-day meeting and announced plans to end its bond-buying program but keep rates unchanged, despite growing disquiet about inflation. Many investors had been anticipating this outcome, leading to muted trading after the announcement.</p><p>Chairman Jerome Powell's postmeeting press conference this afternoon will be closely monitored by investors looking to see if the central bank chief addresses the surge in consumer prices and offers hints about the pathway for interest rates.</p><p>Chris Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management, said he expected Mr. Powell to emphasize the difference between tapering its balance sheet and raising interest rates. He expects stocks to keep rising through the end of the year, continuing a rally that has been fueled by low interest rates over the past year.</p><p>\"It's hard not to be optimistic,\" said Mr. Grisanti.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered around 1.587%, up from 1.546% on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Stocks have surged in recent weeks, lifted by corporate earnings that have given investors confidence that businesses are charting a strong recovery. The reports have helped soothe lingering fears that snarled global supply chains and rising prices might drag on companies and crimp economic growth.</p><p>\"Earning season has been very strong and the beats have been extremely robust,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Despite the fact that there have been lots of concerns about price pressures and supply bottlenecks, there is no sign that any of that is going through into margins.\"</p><p>Though the broader market was calm, companies popular with traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets recorded big swings while options activity heated up. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond surged around 20%. The company, which on Tuesday announced a partnership with grocery chain Kroger, was among the most discussed companies on the forum, according to sites that track mentions of ticker symbols.</p><p>Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard fell 15% after the videogame maker said the release of two of its titles would be delayed. Ride-hailing firm Lyft jumped roughly 8% after saying revenue climbed in the latest quarter as demand for its services returned.</p><p>Avis Budget Group fell over 15% following its more than 100% gain Tuesday, which came after the company reported better-than-expected profit and announced plans to add more electric vehicles to its rental fleet.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell around 3% to $82.09 a barrel. Gold prices weakened around 1.2%.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 added roughly 0.4%.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mostly lower. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index lost 0.3%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index edged down 0.2%. Japanese markets were closed Wednesday for a public holiday.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise as Fed Scales Back Bond Buying</p>",
