  "title": "U.S. News:  Raskin's Bid for Fed Post Is Stalled  ---  GOP resistance to her  climate views and  business ties has a  Biden nominee in limbo  ----  By Andrew Ackerman and Nick Timiraos",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Sarah Bloom Raskin, the Biden administration's nominee for a top regulatory post at the Federal Reserve, is struggling to overcome resistance from Republicans on a Senate committee for which she once served as a lawyer. </p><p>   This week, Republicans lawmakers united in opposition to Ms. Raskin refused to attend a crucial committee vote. That deprived Democrats of a quorum needed to advance her along with four other Fed nominees to the full Senate, including Chairman Jerome Powell. </p><p>   Republicans, especially from energy-producing states such as Pennsylvania and Wyoming, are opposed to Ms. Raskin in part because of her 2020 criticism of the Treasury Department and Fed providing broad-based emergency-lending backstops to assist businesses during the pandemic. She said the backstops should have been designed to avoid lending to highly indebted fossil-fuel companies. </p><p>   Her nomination followed aggressive lobbying by progressive Democrats, including many climate-focused policy activists who frequently cited Ms. Raskin's recent public remarks calling for federal regulators to use their administrative powers to pursue stiffer curbs on climate change. The White House continues to back Ms. Raskin's nomination, and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) has indicated she would advance out of committee if a quorum was reached. </p><p>   Republican lawmakers more recently said they want more information about Ms. Raskin's work as a board member at an obscure financial technology payments firm, Reserve Trust. The GOP officials, led by Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, say they are perturbed by what they perceive as insufficient candor about her role as a director at the company. </p><p>   The impasse comes amid philosophical fissures between some progressive Democrats, who want the central bank to play a more aggressive role addressing climate change and other social issues, and Republicans who fear the Fed is straying beyond its dual mandate of stable prices and full employment. </p><p>   Senate aides described a tense lead-up to Tuesday's scheduled vote, and subsequent postponement. Mr. Toomey told Mr. Brown that he was willing to move forward with all of the Fed nominees except Ms. Raskin, and that he wanted a follow-up briefing with her to discuss her tenure at Reserve Trust, a GOP Senate aide said. </p><p>   Mr. Brown said he would try to set up an additional briefing, according to the GOP aide. That briefing, tentatively planned for Feb. 11, didn't take place after the White House intervened to block it, the aide said. </p><p>   Democrats dispute that another meeting was in order and say Mr. Brown never agreed to an additional briefing. Michael Gwin, a White House spokesman, said Ms. Raskin already engaged in back and forth with Senate lawmakers, including one-on-one meetings with lawmakers and responding to nearly 200 questions after her Feb. 3 hearing. He described the latest requests as a delay tactic. </p><p>   Republicans have extra leverage now. While Democrats control the Senate, a stroke has prevented New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Lujan from participating in Senate business for several weeks. That means Democrats are short of votes to advance any nominees that lack Republican support or to change Senate rules that would allow them to advance Ms. Raskin's nomination if Republicans don't participate in the committee vote. </p><p>   Ms. Raskin previously served on the Fed and as a top Treasury Department official during the Obama administration. Before that, she was Maryland's state commissioner of financial regulation. She is a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.). </p><p>   Ms. Raskin has become a darling of progressive Democrats for statements such as a New York Times opinion article in May 2020 that criticized emergency-lending backstops created by the Fed to thaw frozen corporate-bond markets. </p><p>   \"There is no indication that the value of fossil fuel assets is ever going to return. It's one of the worst investments there is, and yet this is one that the Fed has picked,\" said Ms. Raskin in a video produced by the Years Project, an advocacy group that calls for more action to address climate change. </p><p>   At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Raskin said she wouldn't use her Fed position to restrict lending to the oil-and-gas industry. </p><p></p>",
