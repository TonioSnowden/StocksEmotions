  "title": "Amazon Gives Healthcare Ambitions a Booster Shot; Buying One Medical puts tech giant more directly into patient care and may still be small enough to avoid dominance arguments",
  "text": "<p>The deal is Amazon's third largest ever, following its 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and the $8.5 billion buyout of MGM that was completed in March. The latter deal took nearly a year to close compared with less than two months for Whole Foods, as regulators and lawmakers have taken to scrutinizing deals by major tech players, for fear of allowing them to extend their dominance into new categories.</p><p>The argument was a bit of a stretch in the case of MGM, whose share of the domestic box office hasn't exceeded 4% since 2002, according to the movie industry data provider The Numbers. Likewise, buying One Medical will hardly make Amazon the nation's top doctor. The company's $493 million in commercial revenue last year is less than 1% of total annual spending on primary care in the U.S. for commercial insurance, according to Craig Jones of Stifel. It also won't move the needle much for Amazon financially. One Medical is expected to cross the $1 billion annual revenue mark this year; Amazon now generates more than 35 times that amount just from subscription fees for services like its Prime program.</p><p>But Amazon has long had aspirations for the healthcare space. It bought an online pharmacy called PillPack in 2018, and launched an ambitious joint venture with J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway that same year to figure out a new system to reduce healthcare costs for their employees. The latter ended up collapsing under its own ambitions; the three companies ended the operation last year.</p><p>In comparison, buying an established provider should go a bit smoother. Bernstein's analysts wrote Thursday that the One Medical deal should provide \"cross-selling synergies\" with Amazon's online pharmacy and possibly form the roots of a new service offering to employers. The brokerage also speculated that it could become another benefit of Amazon's ever-expanding Prime bundle; One Medical already runs on an annual membership fee model. Amazon's stock, which has sunk this year on sluggish retail sales, picked up 1% on news of the company's latest deal on Thursday. In this market, a little speculative M&amp;A seems just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon Gives Healthcare Ambitions a Booster Shot</p>",
