  "text": "<p>Overseas holders of a Russian sovereign bond that matured last month are seeking a ruling on whether $1.9 million in interest arrears constituted a \"credit event\" that might allow them to eventually collect a payout on default insurance.</p><p>The EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (CDDC) said on its website on Thursday that holders of the 2022 bond had sent a notice through Euroclear, one of the world's biggest settlement systems for stock and bond trades, \"demanding the payment of approximately $1.9 million\".</p><p>They had asked if a \"pay credit event\" occurred on the unpaid accrued interest and the committee later said it had accepted the request.</p><p>The committee will meet on Friday at 1100 UTC to discuss the issue, it said on its website.</p><p>\"The bonds matured on April 4, 2022 but the payment of principal and interest due at maturity was not made until May 2,\" the holder's query added.</p><p>The notice through Euroclear was sent mid-May.</p><p>Russia had paid nearly $650 million, which included the maturing bond, during a grace period, warranting potential interest arrears.</p><p>But default on other debt now looks inevitable according to some investors, after the U.S. Treasury chose this week not to extend a license that had allowed creditors to receive payments from Russia despite financial sanctions.</p><p>There are currently $2.54 billion of net notional credit default swaps (CDS) outstanding in relation to Russia, including $1.68 billion on the country itself and the remainder on the CDX.EM index, according to JPMorgan calculations.</p>",
