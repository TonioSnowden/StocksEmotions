  "text": "<p>BlackRock Inc. said Friday that its second-quarter profit fell 22% amid a bruising stock market downturn.</p><p>The world's largest asset manager reported net income of $1.08 billion, down from $1.38 billion in the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Earnings amounted to $7.06 a share. That missed the $7.87 expected by analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Revenue dipped 6% to $4.53 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates of $4.55 billion.</p><p>The market is tumbling this year after three years of double-digit gains, with the S&amp;P 500 recently posting its worst first half in more than five decades. Inflation remains at a four-decade high, roiling households and businesses, and investors are bracing for a possible recession as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to try to curb prices.</p><p>The year is off to \"the worst start in 50 years for both stocks and bonds, with global equity markets down 20% and the aggregate bond index down about 10%,\" BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said on an earnings call Friday.</p><p>The turmoil is affecting BlackRock and other financial firms broadly. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley, which reported earnings on Thursday, said their investment bankers brought in far less revenue than a year ago, with an uncertain economy forcing corporate chieftains to the sidelines. But the two banks' traders benefited from the volatility, bringing in more revenue.</p><p>BlackRock shares rose 2% on Friday.</p><p>BlackRock is a top provider of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost alternatives that track market indexes, and demand for what is called passive investing has helped fuel the firm's growth. BlackRock is also a large provider of what are known as actively managed investments, which can include businesses like stock- and bond-picking funds.</p><p>BlackRock's base management fees—those not tied to performance that the firm receives for administering fund holdings—dipped 2%, decreasing to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Performance fees from the firm's actively managed funds fell 69% to $106 million, with the biggest decline coming from its single-strategy hedge funds.</p><p>Revenue from Aladdin, its proprietary software that helps investors manage their portfolios, rose 5% to $332 million.</p><p>The firm brought in nearly $90 billion in new investor money in the quarter, up from about $81 billion in the same period a year ago.</p><p>The firm's assets under management were about $8.5 trillion, down from $9.6 trillion in the first quarter. This is the second time in a row that BlackRock reported a quarter-over-quarter decline in assets under management. The firm ended 2021 with $10.01 trillion in assets, the first time any money manager surpassed that milestone.</p><p>General and administrative expenses rose $69 million from the same period a year ago. However, the firm is \"mindful of the current environment,\" said BlackRock Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin. The firm will delay \"certain senior hires\" into next year, he said, and will also \"junior-ize a number of other roles where appropriate.\"</p><p>Write to Angel Au-Yeung at angel.au-yeung@wsj.com</p><p>BlackRock Profit Falls 22%</p>",
