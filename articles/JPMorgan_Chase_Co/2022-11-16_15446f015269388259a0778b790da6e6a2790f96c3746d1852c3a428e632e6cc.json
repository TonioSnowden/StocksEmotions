  "text": "<p>Energy prices have surged since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Moscow's decision to throttle natural-gas supplies to Europe to undermine Western support for Kyiv. Rising prices have hit consumers and businesses even as economic growth has ground to a halt, with the economy contracting slightly in the third quarter.</p><p>Inflation has also picked up in other parts of Europe, with German consumer prices rising 11.6% in the 12 months through October. By contrast, the U.S. rate of inflation eased to 7.7% in October from 8.2% in September.</p><p>Although the number came in slightly above expectations, reaction was muted on U.K. financial markets. Yields on two-year U.K. government bonds, those most sensitive to interest rate moves, rose around 0.03 percentage point to 3.1%. That is far below their 4.5% peak in September after the release of a now-scrapped government plan to slash taxes and increase borrowing. The pound ticked up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.188 on Wednesday morning.</p><p>\"We cannot have long-term, sustainable growth with high inflation,\" said Jeremy Hunt, the U.K.'s Treasury chief. \" It is our duty to help the Bank of England in their mission to return inflation to target.\"</p><p>Economists say U.K. inflation rates are unlikely to rise much more over coming months, thanks to an energy price cap announced by the government in September which limited the October rise in home energy prices to 27%, compared with the 80% rise initially announced by the energy regulator in its twice-yearly review. Without the price cap, the ONS estimated that the annual rate of inflation would have been 13.8%.</p><p>The Bank of England had expected the inflation rate to come in at 10.9%, and mark the peak for now, a view officials repeated Wednesday in testimony to lawmakers.</p><p>\"It's pretty much flat around this level for another three months, maybe it edges down a bit in the first quarter,\" said BOE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent.</p><p>But inflationary pressures remained strong outside the energy sector, with food prices up 16.4% from a year earlier, the fastest rise since September 1977. The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy and food, was unchanged at 6.5% despite signs of cooling consumer demand.</p><p>\"While the BOE has been looking to slow or pause its tightening cycle, the data are providing little justification for doing so,\" said Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan, in a note to clients.</p><p>The price cap was initially intended to remain in place for two years, but Mr. Hunt later said it would run through the end of March. The outlook for inflation beyond that month will depend on how much further support will be made available to households.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What lies ahead for the U.K. economy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>European governments are providing costly support to households to prevent widespread hardship as higher energy bills make paying for food and shelter more challenging, and to maintain popular approval of their support for Ukraine through sanctions on Russia.</p><p>The coming winter is shaping up as a difficult moment. Some 1.2 million British households don't have incomes high enough to cover their food, energy and housing costs, according to estimates from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, which expects more than 2.5 million people to turn to food charities during the winter months.</p><p>More broadly, the surge in energy prices has left U.K. households with less to spend on other goods and services, and contributed to a slight economic contraction in the three months through September. ONS figures released Tuesday showed that wages in the three months through September were 6% higher than a year earlier, but the faster increase in prices led to a 2.6% fall in inflation-adjusted pay.</p><p>Some businesses worry that hard-pressed consumers may not be able to afford their products, including beer that traditionally comes in pint measures.</p><p>\"We are seeing unprecedented price increases across the business but especially on raw materials and if these were all passed on it would make the cost of a pint almost unaffordable in many pubs,\" said Oliver Robinson, joint managing director of Robinsons Brewery.</p><p>The Bank of England has warned that the third-quarter decline in output likely marked the start of a recession that will last until the end of next year, and possibly into 2024.</p><p>However, the central bank expects the inflation rate to remain high throughout next year, and has signaled that it will likely raise its key interest rate for a ninth successive meeting in December. The scale of that increase will depend in part on the scale and timing of spending cuts and tax rises that Mr. Hunt is due to announce Thursday.</p><p>In addition to high energy prices, the central bank worries that a shortage of workers will keep wage rises and inflation rates high.</p><p>The ONS Tuesday said the share of working-age Britons who were neither working or looking for a job rose to 21.6% in the three months through September, driven by a record number who were suffering from a long-term illness. But the number of vacancies fell, a sign that businesses are trimming their hiring plans as the economy slows.</p><p>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Inflation Hits 41-Year High as Recession Looms</p>",
