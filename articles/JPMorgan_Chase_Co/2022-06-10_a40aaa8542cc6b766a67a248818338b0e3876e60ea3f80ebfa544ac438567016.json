  "title": "U.S. News:  Fuel Costs Upend  Business, Economy  ----  By Collin Eaton, David Harrison and Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   As U.S. gasoline prices approach a record average of $5 a gallon, fuel costs are rippling through almost every corner of business, with signs emerging that the rising expenses are beginning to alter consumer behavior. </p><p>   The price of regular gasoline averaged about $4.97 Thursday, up about 26 cents from the prior week and nearly $2-a-gallon higher than this time last year, according to AAA. The steady climb in prices comes as the U.S. economy's recovery from the pandemic has let loose pent-up demand for travel, by road and by air, and with many returning to work commutes. </p><p>   Prices of gasoline, as well as diesel and jet fuel, continue to face upward pressure for many reasons that are unlikely to go away soon. Oil and fuel production hasn't increased quickly enough to meet growing global demand, as economies emerge from pandemic-related restrictions. U.S. fuel-making capacity has actually declined due to refinery closures, while U.S. exports have remained strong as the thirst for fuel in other parts of the world leads traders to capitalize on the arbitrage opportunities of sending it abroad. </p><p>   The results are being widely felt -- from the food, automobile and trucking industries, to airlines, retail stores and service stations, and even in the oil-and-gas business itself -- with potential political consequences for President Biden and Democrats seeking to maintain their control of Congress in November's midterm elections. </p><p>   Record gasoline prices threaten to curb some fuel demand, according to analysts, economists and executives. Drivers are now buying fewer gallons on each visit to gas stations, but making more frequent trips to fuel up, they said. \"They want to fill up a certain amount in dollars and it just doesn't go as far,\" said Andrew Clyde, chief executive officer of Arkansas-based fuel retailer Murphy USA Inc. </p><p>   The fuel price surge is a big factor in overall inflation, which has reached a four-decade high. Higher gasoline prices account for about 18% of the 8.3% overall inflation rate in April from the previous year, according to the Labor Department. </p><p>   Airlines are grappling with the highest inflation-adjusted jet-fuel prices since January 2009, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. Strong bookings for domestic flights this summer have helped U.S. carriers cover the additional cost by raising fares, executives said, though they remain more cautious about travel demand this coming fall. </p><p>   Airline fares rose 18.6% between March and April, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index, and they are up 33.3% from a year earlier, though they still remain below 2019 levels. </p><p>   \"The driver of airfare increases is almost exclusively jet-fuel prices,\" Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines Holdings Inc., said in an interview last month, noting fuel costs have almost doubled from the same period in 2019. </p><p>   Food makers said the cost of transporting raw materials from farms and factories to distributors and retailers is up, contributing to higher grocery bills for consumers. </p><p>   Mondelez International Inc., maker of Oreos and other snacks, said its overall input costs will be up about 10% to 13% this year, with energy prices adding to the cost of transportation, ingredients and packaging. </p><p>   \"It is predominantly related to energy costs and the ripple effect that energy costs have throughout our commodity basket,\" Chief Financial Officer Luca Zaramella said on a June 1 conference call. Mondelez doesn't expect prices to decrease going into 2023, he said. </p><p>   While inflation affects discretionary spending at retailers overall, consumers buying smaller amounts of fuel more frequently could create opportunities for some retailers to grab market share. Shoppers are visiting Costco Wholesale Corp. more often for its discounted gasoline, executives said during the company's earnings call last month. </p><p>   The auto industry is particularly sensitive to gasoline-price fluctuations. Already, consumer preferences are starting to shift, with more car shoppers giving priority to fuel economy, analysts and executives said. </p><p>   Online searches for electric vehicles have climbed 73% since January, according to data from Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader.com Inc. Interest in hybrids among online shoppers rose 25% in that time frame. </p><p>   Some brands such as Toyota and Kia are reporting strong hybrid and plug-in hybrid sales, and sales of some smaller, more economical models are starting to take off. </p><p>   Surging diesel prices are raising worries at trucking companies, including concerns that rising shipping costs could reduce demand if construction projects are pushed off and retailers cut short restocking efforts. </p><p>   \"We're in uncharted territories at this level,\" said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Solutions, a trucking-industry marketplace that matches loads to available trucks. \"It's hurting a lot of carriers, and it's hurting the smaller carriers the most.\" </p><p>   As demand grows during the summer driving season and with no quick fixes for increasing supplies, many analysts predict prices could climb higher. Gasoline prices could reach a national average of $6.20 a gallon by August, JPMorgan Chase estimated. </p><p></p>",
