  "text": "<p>Mr. Greensill made his first public comments since the firm tumbled into bankruptcy in March, saying he bears complete responsibility for the company's collapse. \"To all of those affected by this, I am truly sorry,\" he said.</p><p>A representative for the company declined to comment on the FCA's investigation.</p><p>Founded by Australian-born Mr. Greensill, the company billed itself as a technology startup that competed with traditional banks such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Greensill's goal was to offer supply-chain finance to companies that had fallen below the radar of traditional banks that preferred larger, more-established clientele.</p><p>Greensill counted former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron as an adviser, and its main financial backer was Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. Greensill had targeted a valuation of $7 billion last fall when it sought to raise equity from new investors.</p><p>Mr. Greensill said he hired the former prime minister to help Greensill increase its brand awareness after a blue-chip company chose a different firm because it hadn't heard of Greensill. Mr. Cameron regularly attended board meetings, Mr. Greensill said.</p><p>The company plunged into crisis in March after it lost credit insurance that was crucial to its business. Credit Suisse Group AG froze $10 billion in investment funds that Greensill relied on to fuel much of its business. Greensill's bank was taken over by authorities in Germany and is under investigation there into its accounting for loans to a major client.</p><p>The startup's business model required complex financial engineering. It made supply-chain loans to companies, then packaged them up into notes, selling those on to investors, which served as off-balance-sheet financing for Greensill.</p><p>The government investigation ramps up pressure on Mr. Greensill, who has been working with the company's bankruptcy advisers to salvage parts of the business.</p><p>The FCA's letter cited \"a number of allegations have been made in the press regarding the circumstances of Greensill's failure, some of which are potentially criminal in nature.\"</p><p>Some of Greensill's blue-chip clients included AstraZeneca PLC and Ford Motor Co. Greensill has also extended financing to lesser-known companies, including startup businesses and companies that are considered higher-risk borrowers.</p><p>Mr. Greensill defended the business model of supply-chain finance, likening it to a checking account for companies. \"Tens of millions of businesses have benefited from that,\" he said, referring to the industry that has built up in recent years.</p><p>But Greensill went beyond bread-and-butter supply-chain finance, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Much of the company's business was extending loans to a small circle of borrowers close to Mr. Greensill, including U.K. steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta, who the Journal has previously reported was the company's biggest client by revenue.</p><p>Mr. Greensill said he had been introduced to Mr. Gupta in 2015 by an executive at an insurance company. Mr. Gupta was an early shareholder but sold the shares to avoid a conflict when the business grew, Mr. Greensill said.</p><p>Mr. Greensill said he regretted that the business had become too concentrated on a single customer.</p><p>Members of the parliamentary committee asked Mr. Greensill about the company's use of future receivables, or loans based on future business. One committee member likened the use of them to fraud.</p><p>Mr. Greensill denied he was a fraud and defended the use of future receivables. He said the business was properly described, and that investors understood what they were purchasing. He said the future receivables were secured against real assets.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that Credit Suisse marketed the supply-chain finance investments as safe products based on transactions that had already occurred.</p><p>Mr. Greensill also said the firm was let down by its biggest insurer, Tokio Marine Holdings Inc., whose yanking of coverage of Greensill's loans uncorked the series of events that culminated in the firm's unraveling. Committee members pressed him on the fact that Greensill had been informed about the insurance problems six months before coverage was pulled on March 1. \"We had an overreliance on insurance generally,\" he said. \"And we did too much of our insurance with one provider.\"</p>",
