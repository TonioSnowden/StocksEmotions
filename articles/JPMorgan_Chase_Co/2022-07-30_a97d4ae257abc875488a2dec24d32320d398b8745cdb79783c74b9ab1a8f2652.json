  "text": "<p>Mr. Moore last month sent letters asking financial institutions that had announced policies against fossil-fuel investments to demonstrate that they aren't engaged in boycotts. Banks can lend or not lend to companies based on financial risk. The problem is many have red-lined some fossil-fuel investments.</p><p>Goldman Sachs in late 2019 ruled out direct financing of new or expanded coal mines and coal-fired power plant projects worldwide as well as oil projects in the Arctic. J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley followed with similar policies, and BlackRock said it would remove coal companies from its actively managed investment funds.</p><p>The masters of finance may have thought the boycotts wouldn't hurt their bottom lines as energy demand and oil prices plunged amid lockdowns. But the boycotts look increasingly short-sighted. Banks didn't earn goodwill from progressives, who continue to harass them for not divesting entirely from fossil fuels.</p><p>Meantime, they have antagonized Republicans in states whose economies and budgets rely on fossil fuels and forgone potentially remunerative investment opportunities. Coal prices have surged to $400 a ton from about $50 before the pandemic as Europe seeks to replace Russian natural gas, and countries everywhere scramble to back up renewable power.</p><p>Yet some West Virginia coal producers say they can't obtain financing to increase output despite record global demand. The U.S. and the world desperately need more fossil-fuel investment, and that includes coal. Banks are doing no favors for the planet or the world's poor who must burn dirtier fuels such as charcoal owing to lack of investment in coal and gas.</p><p>Enter Mr. Moore, who is leading GOP state resistance to these boycotts. \"Our actions will take different forms,\" Mr. Moore and financial officers from 14 states wrote in a letter to financial institutions last November. \"However, the overarching objective of our actions will be the same -- to protect our states' economies, jobs, and energy independence from these unwarranted attacks on our critical industries.\"</p><p>They may be getting results. U.S. Bancorp told Mr. Moore's office that it had dropped its anti-fossil-fuel policy, so it won't be excluded from state contracts. Others haven't budged. While the $46.2 million that West Virginia says J.P. Morgan generates from Mountain State banking contracts last year may be a drop in its revenue bucket, banks stand to lose more business if other states follow its lead.</p><p>The point is to make banks realize there is a cost to their green virtue signaling. Why should states do business with banks that refuse to do business with companies that employ thousands of people in their states?</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
