  "text": "<p>Ford sold about 8 million shares between late Sunday and Monday morning through Goldman Sachs, the people familiar with the move said. Ford is no longer partnering to develop an EV with Rivian, as had been planned under its initial investment in 2019, and wants to gradually reduce its stake in what has become a rival in the electric-truck market, they said.</p><p>Before the sale, Ford held about 102 million shares in Rivian overall, about 11.4% of the company.</p><p>CNBC also reported that JPMorgan was planning to sell between 13 million and 15 million Rivian shares for an undisclosed stakeholder.</p><p>The lockup period for Rivian investors to sell stock after its initial public offering in November expired Sunday. Ford declined to comment. Rivian couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Ford, an early investor in Rivian, has been aggressive in expanding its own lineup of electric vehicles, having recently started production of its own battery-powered pickup, the F-150 Lightning. The Lightning is a direct competitor to one of Rivian's first models, the all-electric R1T pickup, which went on sale late last year.</p><p>Sean McLain contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com</p><p>Ford Sells About 8% of Its Stake in Electric-Vehicle Startup Rivian</p>",
