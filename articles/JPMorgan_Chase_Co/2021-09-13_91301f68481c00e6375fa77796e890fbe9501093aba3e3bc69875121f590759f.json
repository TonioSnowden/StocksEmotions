  "title": "U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Fed Places a Bet on Durable Goods",
  "text": "<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has argued that the higher inflation is largely driven by temporary factors unique to the pandemic. In a speech hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in late August, Mr. Powell offered more details on his thinking. He singled out the sudden rise in durable-goods prices -- in contrast to the more modest rise in services prices -- as evidence that inflation will fall back to the Fed's 2% goal.</p><p>Overall consumer prices -- which combine services and goods -- climbed an average of 1.8% a year in the 25 years leading up to the pandemic. That rise was driven by faster-rising costs for services, which grew an average 2.6% a year over that time. Prices for durable goods -- items designed to last at least three years -- have done the opposite, falling an average of 1.9% a year between early 1995 and early 2020, according to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department's price index for personal-consumption expenditures.</p><p>Mr. Powell cited several forces driving down prices for durable goods. One is globalization: Competition from other countries, in particular emerging markets with lots of low-wage workers like China and India, has stoked competition for American producers and led some to outsource production. As a result, costs for parts and products have fallen.</p><p>Another is technology. New software and more advanced machinery have enabled factories to make products in fewer hours with fewer people, reducing their own costs and ultimately translating into lower prices for consumers.</p><p>By contrast, prices have persistently risen for services -- the bulk of consumer purchases, including haircuts, doctor's visits and tax preparation. Because they are by default labor-intensive -- a barber can still only cut one person's hair at a time -- those industries haven't raised productivity as much as factories.</p><p>The pandemic has flipped this dynamic, with durable goods becoming a big driver of inflation. In July, overall consumer prices rose 4.2% from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. Prices for durable goods rose 7%, twice as fast as the 3.5% gain in prices for services.</p><p>Durable-goods prices accounted for 1 percentage point of the latest inflation rate, Mr. Powell said. The overall effect of rising durable-goods prices was even larger on \"core\" inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. Excluding durable goods, core inflation in the 18 months through June was2.2%, not far from its 12-year average of 2%, according to the Fed.</p><p>What happened? According to Mr. Powell, it's no mystery: Unique forces caused demand for durable goods to rise far more quickly than supply. The government put a lot of money in the hands of consumers, through multiple stimulus packages. And households shifted spending toward durable goods.</p><p>Businesses, short of workers and caught off guard by the surge in demand, have struggled to ship supplies and make products fast enough. A global chip shortage disrupted shipments of laptops and printers, along with cars.</p><p>Consider used cars, which are the bulk of all car purchases. Their prices peaked in 2001, then declined. By February 2020, they had fallen 14% from their all-time high, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index, a separate inflation gauge. Then in the summer of 2020, used-car prices started rising, sharply. In the year through July, they were up 42%.</p><p>Computers followed a similar trajectory. Before the pandemic, prices had fallen rapidly for two decades. But in June 2020, they rose on an annual basis for the first time ever. In July, they shot up 3.7% from a year earlier.</p><p>Mr. Powell argued that once shortages, supply bottlenecks and demand ease, prices will drop, or at least stop rising so steeply. That may already be happening. Durable goods prices rose just 0.3% in July from a month earlier, down from 1% growth in June and 2% in May. Used-car prices also grew much more modestly.</p><p>\"It seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to overall inflation,\" Mr. Powell said.</p><p>There are risks that inflationary pressures will be deeper and longer-lasting than Mr. Powell suggests. Gasoline prices -- a nondurable good -- rose just as fast as used-car prices in the year through July. Food-price growth around the globe is accelerating and could persist, JPMorgan Chase said.</p><p>Services inflation may also pick up. Home prices and rents, one of the largest components of consumption, are rising quickly. Employers in labor-intensive service businesses are facing higher labor costs that they may have to pass along in prices. Companies could decide to buy parts from other countries, or within the U.S., where labor costs are higher.</p><p>Mr. Powell's outlook on durable goods -- and, thus, on inflation -- is a bet that the world after the pandemic will look largely the same as before it.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
