  "text": "<p>In 2013, then in his fourth year of running Bank of America, Brian Moynihan became the first chief executive to turn down Yale University's “Legend in Leadership” award, saying it was too early in his tenure.</p> <p>“He thought he didn't deserve it yet, he thought it was a work in progress,” said Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, who offered Moynihan the prize, which he ultimately accepted in 2018.</p> <p>Moynihan, 61, apparently sees plenty more work to do at BofA. This month he signalled that he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4c61b0d-f006-4dc6-bf02-755706157857\">intends to stay until 2030</a>, joining JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon in seeking a CEO term of at least two decades. Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman has also indicated a desire to remain at the company he has led since 2010 for at least another three years.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the past decade, the chief executives of large US banks have rarely stepped down unless they were forced to. A fraudulent sales scandal toppled two chiefs at Wells Fargo, while Citigroup's Michael Corbat retired early after the bank botched a Revlon loan payment, resulting in millions of dollars in regulatory fines, legal fees and operating losses.</p> <p>Only Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein decided to leave of his own volition when he handed the reins to David Solomon in 2018 after 12 years in the top job. Picking the right time to go can be a challenge, he told the Financial Times.</p> <p>“When things are going well you don't want to leave but when things are going poorly you feel you can't leave,” Blankfein said. “You have to have discipline to leave when you don't want to leave.”</p> <p>Unlike Dimon, a financial services veteran who worked at American Express and helped to create Citigroup at the side of Sandy Weill, Moynihan, a Rhode Island lawyer, is a less obvious Wall Street mainstay. He beat internal and external rivals to replace Ken Lewis at BofA, and has already held on to the top job for longer than many observers had anticipated. </p> <p>“Brian wasn't the expected winner and he has continually surprised to the upside,” Sonnenfeld said. </p> <p>Dimon, Moynihan and Gorman buck the broader trend in corporate America. The average tenure of departing chief executives at finance companies within the Russell 3000 index halved from just under 15 years in 2017 to seven years in 2020, according to data compiled by research group The Conference Board in collaboration with ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE.</p> <p>A long tenure has its obvious advantages: bank chief executives who have been in the job for more than a decade amass the knowledge needed to run sprawling institutions that are often seen as too big to manage. </p> <p>But it can also serve as a roadblock in the push towards greater diversity among the ranks of chief executives, an area where Wall Street has lagged behind other American companies. Citi's Jane Fraser became the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa1501a4-7afb-431a-8812-ec83ef71034c\">first woman to run a major US bank</a> only earlier this year.</p> <p>Banks have tried to compensate for the lack of diversity at the very top by promoting more women to the lower rungs of the C-suite, as evidenced by reshuffles at BofA and JPMorgan this year that handed more responsibility to senior female executives. </p> <p>“The way to tolerate the demand for diversity is to do what Bank of America and JPMorgan have done, which is to . . . promote women into senior posts,” said Matteo Tonello, managing director at The Conference Board.</p> <p>Another downside to long tenures is that ambitious executives can grow tired of slow succession races and decide to leave the company to take the top job elsewhere, or else risk falling out with the existing chief executive when their desire to usurp the incumbent becomes too obvious. </p> <p>Weill has said the reason Dimon left Citi in acrimonious circumstances was that he was impatient to be elevated to the top role. “The problem was in 1999 he wanted to be CEO and I didn't want to retire,” Weill told The New York Times in 2001. “I regret that it came to that. I don't know what else could have been done except for him to be more patient.”</p> <p>Impatience appears to have percolated through the executive ranks at JPMorgan too, where a string of potential Dimon successors have left the bank and are now running other lenders. Jes Staley, now at Barclays, was once tipped as a candidate, as were Bill Winters at Standard Chartered and Matt Zames who moved into the private equity industry.</p> <p>Moynihan's intention to stay at BofA until 2030 was announced shortly after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bf312c9-69d5-45ea-ad8f-d71b15da530f\">departure of Tom Montag</a>, his chief operating officer who was once mooted as potential future chief executive. But Montag, now 64, would have been in his 70s if he had hung around for the job to open up, effectively disqualifying him. </p> <p>BofA said this month it was grooming an expansive slate of potential successors to Moynihan in a reshuffle that was announced by way of a <a href=\"https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2021/09/bank-of-america-announces-senior-leadership-changes.html\">seven-page press release</a>, prompting analysts to quip that it was the longest list of leadership changes they had seen in their careers. </p> <p>“This looks like a decade-long bakeoff, which would be an unofficial record,” said John Coffee, a corporate governance expert at Columbia University.</p> <p>Corporate governance experts point to the complexity of running a lender such as BofA or JPMorgan as one of the reasons tenures of big bank chief executives are twice as long as the average term for a CEO in the S&amp;P 500. The last financial crisis prompted a wave of mergers that created universal banks with a wide range of business lines from wealth management and retail mortgages to investment banking and trading.</p> <p>“Running a bank today is quite different from running a bank in 2007,” said Marc Goldstein, head of US research at the corporate governance group Institutional Shareholder Services.</p> <p>In addition to requiring broad operational expertise, top banking jobs have become increasingly political over the past decade. </p> <p>Bank chief executives are regularly hauled before Congress to testify, and are expected to spend a good portion of their time working through complicated and ever-changing financial regulations. They are also frequently called upon by the media to opine on the global economy. </p> <p>“Part of the job of a bank CEO in a crisis is to exude confidence to prevent the market from panicking, so there can be advantages to having someone who's been through a couple [of] crises and who can project that air of calm,” Goldstein said.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise in New York 2021 'In era of quick-fire bosses, Wall Street embraces the ‘forever CEO'' FT.com 22 September.
