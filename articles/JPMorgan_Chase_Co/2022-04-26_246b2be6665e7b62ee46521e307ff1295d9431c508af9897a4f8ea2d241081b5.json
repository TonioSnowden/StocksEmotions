  "text": "<p>UBS traders propelled the Swiss bank to its best first-quarter performance since 2007 as gains driven by volatile markets made up for a lacklustre performance by its wealth managers.</p> <p>The world's largest wealth manager announced on Tuesday $2.7bn of profit before tax for the first quarter, up 19 per cent on last year and comfortably ahead of the $2.4bn predicted by analysts.</p> <p>Profits at UBS's investment bank more than doubled compared with the first quarter last year, when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/281ec98b-1366-415e-88ae-8154d4fe07e5\">lost $774mn</a> in the collapse of family office Archegos. </p> <p>The bank benefited in the first quarter of 2022 from a 59 per cent increase in revenues in its trading division thanks to a strong performance in equity derivatives, interest rates and foreign exchange as the war in Ukraine caused market volatility.</p> <p>But its wealth business was hit by a 7 per cent decline in revenues compared with the same period last year, with UBS saying transaction-based income fell 19 per cent as clients, particularly in Asia, drew back from markets.</p> <p>“The first quarter was dominated by extraordinary geopolitical and macro events,” said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ccf37b6-8128-46d2-8059-11e34f8f83c1\">Ralph Hamers</a>, chief executive. “Against this backdrop, we remained focused on executing our strategic plans, serving our clients and managing risk.”</p> <p>Analysts expected UBS to be the best-performing European investment bank in the first quarter, with the lender benefiting from higher revenues in its global markets division, which is focused on equities and foreign exchange.</p> <p>Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the slowdown in UBS's Asian wealth management business was expected, but this was outweighed by better than expected results in the investment bank.</p> <p>“Overall the results are solid, capital not an issue and should lead to ongoing outperformance with limited concerns about Russia, credit risk and a resilient wealth management business,” he said.</p> <p>In the days following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, UBS <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6515cad0-f5a3-4ea1-908b-1e05f72105d8\">revealed it had $10mn in loans</a> outstanding to clients targeted by western sanctions. It said it also had about $200mn of exposure to Russian assets used as collateral in Lombard lending and $634mn of direct risk exposure to the country.</p> <p>On Tuesday, UBS said it had reduced its direct risk exposure to Russia by a third to about $400mn. </p> <p>It added that EU and Swiss rules that prohibit accepting deposits of more than €100,000 from Russians not entitled to live in the European Economic Area affected 0.7 per cent of assets in its wealth management division.</p> <p>The lender's share price is flat this year after recovering from a 28 per cent fall during the early days of the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>UBS repurchased $1.7bn of shares in the first quarter as part of its $5bn buyback plan for the year.</p> <p>The bank's shares were up 2.4 per cent in early trading on Tuesday.</p><p>Source: Owen Walker, European Banking Correspondent 2022 'UBS traders drive Swiss bank's best first-quarter profits in 15 years' FT.com 26 April.
