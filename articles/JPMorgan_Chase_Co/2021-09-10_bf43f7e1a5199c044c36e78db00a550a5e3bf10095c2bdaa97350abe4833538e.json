Equally impressive was a meaningfully more favorable gross margin, as higher air-freight was offset by significant fixed cost leverage and lower markdowns vs. 2019, as well as lower SG&amp;A deleverage.”</p><p>MKM rates Lululemon stock buy with a $468 price target, up from $419.</p><p>JPMorgan also raised its price target to $500 from $450 in a note that maintains its overweight stock rating.</p><p>UBS took a more moderate tone, saying the stock price already accounts for the anticipated earnings growth.
