  "text": "<p>Lloyd's of London, the specialist market for insuring large and esoteric risks, has for the first time&#xa0;in two decades&#xa0;taken out cover to protect its emergency fund against extreme losses stemming from another pandemic or financial crisis.</p> <p>The market has agreed £650m of cover to shield its near-£3bn <a href=\"https://www.lloyds.com/about-lloyds/investor-relations/capital-structure\">Central Fund</a>, a backstop set up nearly 100 years ago after one Lloyd's underwriter incurred crippling losses. It can be called on in the event that a claim against any Lloyd's member blows through its own capital buffer.</p> <p>Lloyd's is a marketplace where brokers and underwriters trade a range of risks, providing cover from everything from shipwrecks to a pop singer losing their voice. </p> <p>The new five-year arrangement will reimburse total annual losses in the fund that exceed £600m, but has an upper limit of £1.25bn.</p> <p>“In the event that something really, really big happens, this makes it much more safe for our policyholders that we will basically pay out the claims they are entitled to receive some money for,” said Burkhard Keese, Lloyd's of London's chief financial officer.</p> <p>Lloyd's has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with underwriters expecting an overall hit of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75ce339e-2586-46fd-ae96-1c3e2df24875\">more than £6bn</a>, particularly from event cancellation and business interruption policies.&#xa0;</p> <p>The new contract for the Central Fund is a reinsurance agreement that allows Lloyd's to effectively shift risk off its balance sheet.</p> <p>The first £450m has been provided by a newly created company, financed by investment bank JPMorgan. The rest of the exposure is held by a group of eight reinsurers including Germany's Munich Re, France's Scor and Berkshire Hathaway in the US. </p> <p>Keese added that the structure would also allow the market to write more business, as the arrangement has a lower cost of capital, enabling overall premiums to grow in the region of 30 per cent to 40 per cent.</p> <p>The new cover has been placed and structured by Aon, one of the world's biggest insurance brokers.</p> <p>Reinsurers included in the arrangement also have units within the Lloyd's market. Overlaps have a mixed history at Lloyd's: in the so-called LMX spiral in the late 1980s, the practice of Lloyd's syndicates reinsuring each other on the same risk spectacularly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2af2b7a4-49b9-11dc-9ffe-0000779fd2ac\">blew up</a> after a series of large claims saw losses ricochet around the market.</p> <p>Keese said that the first £450m layer of the cover was fully collateralised, held in safe assets, and the remaining risk was diversified among the group of reinsurers. Lloyd's had conducted due diligence with the companies to make sure that funds would be available, even if one of the reinsurers had exposure to the same “tail-end” event, he said.</p> <p>The cover is effective from January 2021. Lloyd's will seek approval for the model from the UK's prudential regulator, expected by the end of the year. Lloyd's expects it to mean an improvement in the market's central solvency ratio, a key measure of its robustness.</p> <p>The last claim against the Central Fund was in 2007 and aggregate claims against it in any one year have never exceeded the £600m level that would be required to trigger this new contract, Lloyd's said. </p> <p>The Central Fund last had a reinsurance arrangement in 1999, but the JPMorgan-backed structure is a first for the market, Keese said.</p><p>Source: Ian Smith in London 2021 'Lloyd's of London takes out cover to protect emergency fund' FT.com 17 June.
