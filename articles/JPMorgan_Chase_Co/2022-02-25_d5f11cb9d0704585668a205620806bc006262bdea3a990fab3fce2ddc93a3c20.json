  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/1d14c8bf-d6fd-4cb0-b654-9dfdc4254bc1\">has disclosed</a> that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has been examining the bank's block trading business since 2019 and the Department of Justice recently joined with its own investigation.</p> <h2>Russia's invasion of Ukraine permeates the financial world</h2> <p>As Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07bbc5c7-e620-4734-83b5-7bb261363c35\">wages</a> war in Ukraine, global markets are in turmoil — supply chains are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be468d75-a085-462d-99c8-359abe8a4ae6\">rupturing</a>, Russia's currency and stock market are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9b860f6-912d-4758-a61e-16407f76f878\">tumbling</a>, and oil prices are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b2df0e9-a87f-4c67-9a52-88e8ee12c25e\">on a volatile ride</a>.</p> <p>The gaze has also turned inward for the world's most powerful corporations, financial institutions and professional services firms as they grapple with their own ties to Russia amid an onslaught of global sanctions.</p> <p>Some of the west's largest energy groups have found themselves inextricably intertwined with the crisis. One example is the UK oil major <strong>BP</strong>, which holds a near-<a href=\"https://www.bp.com/en_ru/russia/home/who-we-are/partnership.html\">20 per cent stake</a> in Russian oil company <strong>Rosneft</strong> and whose chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27c2c8c4-89be-4744-ac6c-bf4bb9d349bc\"><strong>Bernard Looney</strong></a> and his predecessor<strong> Bob Dudley</strong> sit on Rosneft's board.</p> <p>Last year, the stake generated profits for BP of more than $2.4bn, from which it collected a dividend of $640mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Let's not worry about things until they happen and who knows what's going to happen,” Looney told investors several weeks ago regarding conflict in Ukraine. Time to worry, Bernard.</p> <p>That said, Rosneft has been under US and EU sanctions since 2014 — when Russia annexed Crimea — measures that haven't propelled Looney or Dudley to cut links. </p> <p>The conflict has rippled through the European banking sector, dragging down shares in Italy's <strong>UniCredit</strong> and France's<strong> Société Générale</strong>, which both have consumer banking operations in Russia.</p> <p>Professional services firms have been hit, too. Management consultancies <strong>McKinsey &amp; Company</strong> and<strong> Boston Consulting Group</strong> each have about 400 people working in Moscow. </p> <p>The UK's magic circle law firms also have about 150 lawyers in Russia, while international law firms including <strong>CMS</strong>,<strong> Dentons</strong> and <strong>Baker McKenzie</strong> have shuttered their Ukraine offices and are working to transport staff to EU offices. Big Four accounting firm <strong>PwC</strong> advised its 750 staff in Ukraine to stay home on Thursday.</p> <p><strong>Joe Biden</strong>'s administration is continuing to increase the pressure on Russia's economy, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/1600cbab-3c9d-4059-872a-c5cf512169a1?\">severing ties</a> between the US financial system and the country's largest lenders <strong>Sberbank</strong> and <strong>VTB</strong>, along with three other midsize Russian institutions. Together, the sanctioned banks oversee about $1tn in assets.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8797954.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>However, Biden's administration refrained from cutting off <strong>Gazprombank</strong>, Russia's third-largest lender. The state-controlled bank acts as the main facilitator of foreign payments for oil and gas, and if closed off from US dollars could mean severe consequences for Europe — which depends on Russia for 40 per cent of its natural gas supply.</p> <p>The story is moving fast as world leaders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69f72de5-d727-496d-9f9d-316db7bdaf03\">debate</a> whether to eject Russia from the<strong> Swift </strong>international payments system, European football's governing body <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0938915-4493-4cca-8a88-f9b1185534bc\">prepares to relocate</a> the Champions League final from St Petersburg, and global banks get ready to navigate a maze of new sanctions.</p> <p>Keep tabs on the corporate fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be468d75-a085-462d-99c8-359abe8a4ae6\">here</a>.</p> <h2>A turbine powerhouse loses wind</h2> <p>The few investors excited by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66dbeab2-8be9-4385-a3b4-af63874fa8c7\">Germany's largest-ever spin-off</a> — the separation of <strong>Siemens Energy </strong>from its parent company in the autumn of 2020 — were interested not in the legacy fossil fuels business itself. They were after its majority stake in turbine maker <strong>Siemens Gamesa</strong>, a world leader in offshore wind. </p> <p>An assessment of the company's market cap after its lacklustre stock market debut showed that shareholders valued Siemens Energy's gas and power contracts, responsible for two-thirds of its revenues, at minus €2bn.</p> <p>So it has come as a shock to investors, and indeed to Siemens Energy's management, that the supposedly future-proof Gamesa has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1901cc04-8fa9-48c7-a499-6b5bbc78cfe6\">blown an €8bn hole</a> in its balance sheet. That spells trouble for both the spun-off company and its largest shareholder, <strong>Siemens</strong>.</p> <p>Some of the problems at Gamesa were unique, such as a failure to predict snow in Norway. But the bigger concern for Siemens Energy is that soaring raw materials prices are threatening to blow the entire wind energy industry off course.</p> <p>At a fiery annual general meeting on Thursday, Siemens Energy boss <strong>Christian Bruch</strong> insisted that although it would take time to turn round Gamesa, “the wind market is intact”.&#xa0;</p> <p>But privately, the warning from Siemens Energy insiders is stark. “There is no profit pool today,” one person told the FT's Joe Miller. </p> <p>“If the market [remains] like this we will have no western company going into [wind energy]. The Chinese will eventually come through with their Belt and Road Initiative, and the next thing they will do is export onshore wind [turbines], at no matter what price,” they added.</p> <p>It's a wake-up call for green-minded investors and, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b787a27f-78f4-411e-9435-bb9e980c2a7f#post-9b47fc01-b9ba-42f2-8dc6-ed0426e27485\">given the indefinite suspension</a> of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on Tuesday, a timely one too.</p> <h2>Dealmakers book one-way tickets out of Hong Kong</h2> <p>Last year, <strong>HSBC </strong>relocated <a href=\"https://www.finews.asia/finance/36352-senior-j-p-morgan-bankers-leave-hong-kong\">four of its top executives</a> from London to Hong Kong. The moves weren't coincidental for a bank that earned more than half of its group profits in 2020 from the territory, where it was founded by British merchants in 1865. </p> <p>The geopolitical tightrope HSBC had been walking between the west and China has been worn thinner by growing geopolitical tensions over Hong Kong. However, its chief executive <strong>Noel Quinn</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75b73313-9bbb-499d-8e76-8954a79fad8f\">was determined</a> not to “flip-flop” on the lender's China strategy.</p> <p>HSBC may have already doubled down on Hong Kong, but others are reconsidering their operations in the territory.</p> <p>An exodus of top banking executives have poured out of Asia's once-glittering financial hub as its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd81844a-31a6-48de-9de5-235ade24c3b5\">“zero-Covid”</a> pursuit has made doing business extremely tricky. The territory has banned travel from nine countries including the US and UK, and requires quarantine periods of up to 21 days for international arrivals.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ffd263d-3c1d-4c25-9c8f-f76237607357\">latest to skip town</a> is <strong>Bank of America</strong>'s Asia-Pacific co-head of global capital markets <strong>Craig Coben</strong>, who will return home to London and retire, a source told the FT. The US lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2f645e8-d093-4d93-94fb-23f3cb690bd7\">was identified</a> last month as the first of its Wall Street peers to formally review whether to relocate jobs out of Hong Kong in favour of up-and-coming Singapore.</p> <p>Dual-listed<strong> Prudential</strong>, which recently announced plans to relocate its next chief executive to Hong Kong as part of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85efde3a-a7f3-495e-9ed3-2e97f8a250cc\">strategic shift</a> towards Asia may now walk that decision back given the travel restrictions. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> bankers have also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-21/jpmorgan-s-holsheimer-to-leave-hong-kong-adding-to-departures?sref=OziMsGoK\">begun to file out</a>, per Bloomberg.</p> <p>HSBC had a promising fourth quarter, as pre-tax profits nearly doubled to $2.7bn after the bank sold its retail business and focused on wealth management. But it could soon see the business's affluent client base begin to disintegrate, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb9b3fc2-dfb7-4089-ab5d-66f790ec3b91\">Lex cautions</a>, as more top-tier financiers pack their bags.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Santander</strong> chair<strong> Ana Botín</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae9ae0e0-f3fa-45d2-bb06-5366fa0423dc\">has ceded</a> some of her responsibilities at the bank, delegating operational authority to chief executive<strong> José Antonio Álvarez</strong> in response to pressure from European regulators to improve corporate governance.</p></li>  <li><p>Electric vehicle maker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4cbb58-d41c-4487-a24a-8ac8ce088375\"><strong>Nikola</strong></a> has appointed<strong> Lynn Forester de Rothschild</strong>, co-founder of<strong> Inclusive Capital Partners</strong>, to its board of directors.
