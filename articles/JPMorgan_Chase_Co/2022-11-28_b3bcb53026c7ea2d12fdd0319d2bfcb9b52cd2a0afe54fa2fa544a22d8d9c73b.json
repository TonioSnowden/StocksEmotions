  "text": "<p>The bankruptcy filing of cryptocurrency lender BlockFi Inc. is a black eye for one of the industry's biggest boosters, tech investor Peter Thiel.</p><p>A venture-capital firm spun out from Mr. Thiel's Thiel Capital, Valar Ventures, owned 19% of BlockFi's shares, according to documents filed with the bankruptcy court. That ranks Valar among BlockFi's largest shareholders.</p><p>Earlier this year, Vauld Group, another cryptocurrency lender that Valar backed, froze customer withdrawals and filed for protection from its creditors in Singapore.</p><p>Valar executives and a spokesman for Mr. Thiel didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>After co-founding financial-tech company PayPal Holdings Inc. two decades ago, Mr. Thiel gained renown in Silicon Valley for his early bets on startups including Facebook Inc. and SpaceX.
