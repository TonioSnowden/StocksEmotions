  "text": "<p>Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contracted 0.6%. The blue-chip index has dropped 1.8% so far this week. Contracts tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 ticked down 0.3%.</p><p>Stocks have been rocked this week by concerns that an uptick in Covid-19 infections globally and a slowdown in China's growth could impede the economic recovery. Worries about rising inflation levels and the Federal Reserve's signals that it will scale back some of its easy money policiesare also weighing on sentiment. New lockdowns to contain the virus could put further pressure on supply chains, investors say.</p><p>\"We're looking at a period of very strong, but also very uneven global growth over the next couple of months,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The government reaction now looks very different across different parts of the world. If inflation does prove to be more stubborn, it could change how quickly the Fed has to tighten once they get going.\"</p><p>The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of turbulence in markets, rose to its highest level since May.</p><p>Money managers moved funds into assets that are considered safer to hold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.232% from 1.241% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>Futures on Brent crude, the international benchmark, were relatively flat at $66.44 a barrel. Gold futures rose 0.3%.</p><p>The sapping of risk appetite weighed on stocks world-wide. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.4%. The index has fallen 2.1% this week, on track for its worst week since February.</p><p>Major stock indexes in Asia ended the day lower. China's Shanghai Composite closed down 1.1%, South Korea's Kospi declined 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng contracted 1.8%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Dow on Track to Erase August's Gains as Futures Slide</p>",
