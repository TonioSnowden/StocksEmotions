  "text": "<p>Barclays' first-quarter net profit almost tripled, powered by a brighter economic outlook for the UK and US and another strong performance at the investment bank.</p> <p>The surge in earnings was largely due to a sharp drop in new coronavirus-related loan-loss reserves, as government support and vaccination programmes led to a lower than expected level of defaults and better growth prospects.</p> <p>Credit impairment charges plunged to £55m in the quarter, the lender said on Friday, a far cry from the £2.1bn booked at the start of 2020 when the world was bracing for the pandemic.</p> <p>However, unlike domestic peers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddd53802-2352-48ec-a15d-b2fc3b9da058\">HSBC</a>, Lloyds and NatWest and banks on Wall Street, Barclays did not reduce its overall reserves for bad loans, which remain at more than £9bn. It also sounded a cautious note about its British consumer unit.</p> <p>“While evidence of recovery is encouraging, we have continued to take a cautious view of the impact of the pandemic on the business,” said chief executive Jes Staley. “Headwinds to income in Barclays UK are expected to persist in 2021, driven by the subdued demand for unsecured lending and the low interest rate environment.”</p> <p>The investment bank again performed well in volatile markets, while a surge in dealmaking and special purpose acquisition companies — vehicles that raise money by listing on public markets then searching for a company to acquire — drove merger and advisory income.</p> <p>Although revenue was slightly down, lower loan impairments meant pre-tax profit at the unit rose 45 per cent to £1.75bn, beating estimates for £1.5bn. The bank said equity trading revenue surged 65 per cent to a record £932m, but fixed-income and currency trading (FICC) dropped 35 per cent, which the bank blamed on an especially good comparable first quarter last year.</p> <p>Barclays also claimed the capital markets and advisory division had its “best ever quarter on a comparable basis”, with income rising 35 per cent.</p> <p>Still, Citigroup analyst Andrew Coombs pointed out that although equities revenue growth outpaced US rivals, fixed-income and advisory income lagged behind <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa760b98-6514-425d-a208-b397a348b30c\">Deutsche Bank</a> and Wall Street by a substantial amount. France's BNP Paribas also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e4bd0b8-6b20-4fb7-965c-3d682146d85a\">reported</a> softer fixed-income revenues on Friday.</p> <p>“FICC wasn't where we wanted it to be, but it all came out to a balance in the end,” Staley said of the trading unit.</p> <p>Analysts were also disappointed by a 10 per cent increase in quarterly costs to £3.6bn and a warning that annual expenses would continue to rise in 2021, which helped send the bank's shares down 5 per cent on Friday. The increase was partly due to an extra £335m top up to the bonus pool, which Staley defended as necessary to keep pace with US banks that were boosting bonus accruals at a faster rate.</p> <p>Barclays also flagged that it would release the results of a real estate review in the next few months, which will outline how the bank will cut office space as working patterns change as the result of Covid.</p> <p>The performance of the investment bank helps Staley in his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/febd924d-fccf-4525-bc6a-c65460d394c3\">battle against</a> activist investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/febd924d-fccf-4525-bc6a-c65460d394c3\">Edward Bramson</a>, who led several unsuccessful campaigns to shrink the division and unseat the chief executive.</p> <p>Staley made retaining the business a cornerstone of his strategy, arguing it would be a vital counterbalance of its core British retail business in a crisis, a thesis that has played out so far during coronavirus.</p> <p>Barclays overall first-quarter net income was £1.7bn, comfortably beating the average analyst forecast of £1.2bn, and up from £605m in the same period last year.</p> <p>Group revenue fell 6 per cent to £5.9bn largely because of low interest rates and subdued demand for credit cards and non-mortgage loans in the UK, but was still greater than the £5.6bn forecast.</p> <p>The bank said it had no further update on the Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into historic links between Staley and late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was a client of Staley's when he was at JPMorgan Chase. The probe started in February 2020.</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris in London 2021 'Barclays' quarterly profit almost triples as outlook brightens' FT.com 30 April.
