  "title": "U.S. News: New York Companies Face Vaccine Order --- Requirement goes into effect this month before new mayor succeeds de Blasio",
  "text": "<p>The mandate, which applies to employees working in person, will go into effect Dec. 27 -- days before a new mayor takes office, and as a federal vaccine requirement for many private-sector employees remains entangled in a court battle. About 184,000 businesses in the city would be affected, according to New York City Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi.</p><p>\"We in New York City have decided to use a pre-emptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid,\" Mr. de Blasio said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" where he announced the new mandate. The mayor cited recent cases linked to the Omicron variant and coming holiday gatherings as some of the reasons for the move.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio said more details about the rules and how they would be enforced will be released Dec. 15.</p><p>Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group whose members include large companies such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., said many employers in the city were caught off guard by the announcement and its timing. The mandate is set to take effect just days before Mayor-elect Eric Adams replaces Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat.</p><p>\"There's no clarity around who and how this will be enforced,\" Ms. Wylde said.</p><p>Evan Thies, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, said the mayor-elect would evaluate the mandate, as well as other Covid-19 strategies, when he takes office.</p><p>For now, much remains unclear, Ms. Wylde said. On Monday morning, she said, some employers asked her if they would need to fire workers who don't comply with the new rules, or if there would be a way for employees to take a test in lieu of vaccinations.</p><p>The new rules could create \"problematic confrontations\" between employers and workers and spur potential layoffs as some businesses struggle with labor shortages, said Randy Peers, president and chief executive of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Many large New York employers said Monday they will evaluate the details of the mandate. A spokesman for Macy's Inc. said the retailer was reviewing the information. Macy's requires corporate employees to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test before entering its offices.</p><p>Employment lawyers say the mandate is likely to face legal challenges from business groups, though much will depend on how details of the rules are written.</p><p>Ian Carleton Schaefer, chair of the New York employment and labor practice at the law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb, said the city's vaccine requirement likely would be structured similarly to those of the Biden administration.</p><p>The federal rules mandate employers with at least 100 workers require employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or test negative for it weekly and wear a mask in the workplace. A federal appeals court temporarily blocked the requirements last month, saying they raise \"grave statutory and constitutional issues.\"</p><p>Mr. de Blasio said Monday he is confident the city's new mandate would survive any legal challenges \"because it's universal.\"</p><p>\"I don't know all the intricacies of what the Biden administration has been through, but I do know this: Our health commissioner has put a series of mandates in place. They have won in court, state court, federal court, every single time,\" Mr. de Blasio told MSNBC.</p><p>The city in August started requiring people to show proof of vaccination for certain indoor activities, such as going to the gym or eating inside restaurants. As part of Mr. de Blasio's Monday announcement, the city would now require children ages 5 through 11, who recently became eligible to get vaccinated against the virus, to have vaccine proof for indoor dining, entertainment and fitness.</p><p>Existing mandates in New York and elsewhere in the U.S. have helped increase vaccination rates, said Lorna Thorpe, a professor of epidemiology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. The addition of this new mandate -- and at this moment, with a new variant and possibilities for more spread indoors in the colder months and during the holiday season -- is a smart strategy, she said.</p><p>New York, like other parts of the country, has seen newly reported Covid-19 cases rise in recent days as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread. The seven-day average of daily confirmed and probable infections was 1,975 as of Dec. 6, according to the latest data from the city's health department.</p><p>Officials also are worried about the potential impact of the Omicron variant. New York state said Monday it had detected 12 Covid cases linked to the new strain, seven of which were in New York City residents.</p><p>Nearly 78% of New York City residents have gotten at least one vaccine dose, and 70% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to data from the city's health department.</p><p>---</p><p>Allison Prang, Mike Colias and Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
