  "text": "<p><br>The pandemic has been a spur to reflection. Jamie Dimon, who thankfully survived a dangerous cardiac incident in 2020, ponders the health of traditional banks and their likely longevity in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33c9577-0faf-424d-919e-68bda2052867\">34,000-word shareholder letter</a>. They are under competitive pressure from shadow banks and fintechs.</p> <p>The Greensill and Archegos scandals are reminders that newfangled financiers, no matter how novel or innovative, still cleave symbiotically to old-fashioned lenders.</p> <p>The JPMorgan boss points out that the market valuation of the US banking sector has not moved much in the past two decades — from $1.2tn in 2000 to a nominal $2.2tn in 2020. At the same time, bank loans outstanding have nearly tripled to more than $10tn. Valuations have not kept up with banking activity. </p> <p>Another metric — the sharp rise in common equity and liquid assets — explains that disconnect. Returns have plummeted as banks were forced to hold higher amounts of buffer capital.</p> <p>Dimon then considers the non-banks that have taken up lending as well as welding themselves into the financial sector plumbing. The upstarts have gained traction partly through regulatory arbitrage.</p> <p>The boss of this $465bn market cap institution is worrying unduly. Banks face the tightest regulation because they take deposits which are federally insured. Large banks have complex, interconnected operations that make them systemically important. </p> <p>Even massive alternatives business Blackstone, which manages more than $600bn, takes most of its money from sophisticated investors who actively commit risk capital. And the private debt and equity it extends to companies is hardly low-cost financing.</p> <p>In contrast, big banks still have an unsurpassed variety of products and enviable capacity to supply affordable financing. When hedge fund Archegos Capital needed leverage to buy tens of billions in public equities, it went to large banks. And when Greensill Capital required a financing machine for its shadow supply-chain lending operation, Credit Suisse was happy to step in.</p> <p>The scandals have been embarrassing and in some cases costly for the banks. Both blow-ups point, however, to the centrality of large, regulated lenders within the financial system. Banks, like Dimon himself, have a habit of emerging from health scares in decent shape.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline. </em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Dimon/Greensill: his report of banking's demise is exaggerated ' FT.com 7 April.
