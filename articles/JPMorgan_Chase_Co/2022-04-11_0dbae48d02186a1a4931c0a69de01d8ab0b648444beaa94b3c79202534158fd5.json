  "text": "<p>Is the boring variety of banking about to get exciting? A slowdown in M&amp;A activities and a collapse in initial public offerings this year mean the stars of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1f73759-4ebb-42e7-9ae2-382ae84d8b90\">first-quarter earnings season</a> will not be high-powered dealmakers. Instead, centre stage will be occupied by retail bankers brandishing credit cards, loan books and interest margins that are on the way up.</p> <p>The value of M&amp;A deals struck worldwide fell by more than a fifth during the first three months of the year compared with the year before, Refinitiv data show. Market upheaval caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought the market for new issuance to a virtual standstill. </p> <p>Issuers raised just $2bn via 18 deals during the first quarter — a 95 per cent year-on-year drop, according to Renaissance Capital.</p> <p>Overall, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are expected to have pulled in about 40 per cent less in investment banking fees during the first quarter, says Refinitiv. </p> <p>The outlook for traditional banking is rosier. Loan demand and credit card balances, after nearly two years of tepid to negative growth, show signs of improvement. Interest rate rises — the first of which came in March — will finally lift interest income and margins. </p> <p>The jump in net interest income may not be enough to keep profits from falling at all US banks. Citi, for example, is widely expected to take a writedown on a portion of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43746558-e6c7-4e87-9564-e7aab4592be0\">$9.8bn exposure to Russia</a>. Rising costs and expenses may negate benefits from higher rates.</p> <p>Trading remains a wild card. Revenues from debt and equity trading are likely to be down year on year given the tough comparatives. But the decline could be smaller than feared given volatility during the period. </p> <p>Retail-focused Wells Fargo could end up featuring as the surprise winner this earnings season. Big regional banks such as PNC Financial and US Bancorp also look like good bets.</p> <p>Main Street banking lacks the cool factor of investment banking at bulge bracket institutions. But specialist retail banks should prove to be rock-solid investments this year.</p><p>Source:  2022 'US banks: Main Street may trump Wall Street this earnings season' FT.com 11 April.
