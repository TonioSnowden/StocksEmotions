  "text": "<p>Worries about long-dormant inflation suddenly gripped financial markets. A selloff of government bonds accelerated, pushing long-term yields sharply higher and sparking a flight from high-growth stocks like those of technology companies. ARK's funds, most of which are dominated by shares of unprofitable, early-stage tech and biotech companies, were hit particularly hard.</p><p>Several days of declines culminated with the ETFs falling as much as 30% between Feb. 12 and March 8. In comparison, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 11% from its February record to its March low.</p><p>\"It kept dropping, dropping, dropping, and then it was down 25%. It got painful,\" Jackson Call, a 24-year-old dental student in Chapel Hill, N.C., said of the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF . Mr. Call had just bought more shares of the firm's second-biggest fund, boosting his investment to about $50,000 when the tech trade fizzled.</p><p>The nearly daily declines proved hard for Mr. Call to stomach, so he sold some shares. Including the losses, his investment in the ETF shrunk to $30,000. He says he considered selling more until he watched one of Ms. Wood's YouTube videos reassuring investors that the volatility would die down and ultimately be a \"gift\" that would drive further gains.</p><p>\"She helped me not to sell,\" Mr. Call added.</p><p>Ms. Wood has leaned on television interviews and YouTube videos, which racked up more than 1.5 million views, to put investors at ease throughout the volatility. Many have embraced her vision of investing in \"disruptive companies\" such as Square Inc., Roku Inc . and Tesla Inc . that she believes are on course to change the world.</p><p>\"It's exciting to be alive. We're as excited as ever about everything we're doing,\" Ms. Wood said in a video posted March 5. An ARK spokeswoman said the firm's officers weren't available for comment.</p><p>The tech-sector selloff presented ARK with its biggest test since last year's stock-market crash. ARK ultimately had a blowout year in 2020, with its ETFs outpacing the broader market. Investors plowed more than $36 billion into the funds, boosting assets to nearly $60 billion at one point.</p><p>Even during the recent tumult, investors put more money into most of the funds than they took out, adding a net $2 billion to ARK's coffers over the past month. That is about $320 million more than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co ., the eighth-largest ETF issuer in the U.S. As of Monday, ARK managed $50.3 billion.</p><p>Some investors, like Mr. Call, said Ms. Wood's conviction kept them from selling out completely. Others said they took her bullish talk and the fact that ARK continued buying shares of Tesla, Roku and other stocks as a sign to double down.</p><p>\"It may sell off 50%,\" said Shawn DaCruz, 31, a pharmacist who owns a few hundred shares of ARK's genomic fund. \"But if you look at the companies she owns, some of the larger holdings like Square and Tesla, in five years, I'm pretty sure those companies will be around and they will be bigger than they are now.\"</p><p>Mr. DaCruz is one of ARK's more passionate investors. He says he reads every tweet, watches every video and listens to the podcasts put out by Ms. Wood and ARK -- and has even followed Ms. Wood into some of the individual stocks that her funds buy.</p><p>Earlier this year, he started designing T-shirts, sweatshirts and hats emblazoned with ARK or the ticker symbols of its five main ETFs. He sells them through an online store that his fiancee helped build. Ultimately, he said he is sticking with Ms. Wood, even though his investment in ARK's genomic fund, which he started building up last fall, gave up all of its gains at one point.</p><p>Jeff Sanders, a 55-year-old retiree, also follows Ms. Wood closely after first buying shares of the flagship ARK Innovation ETF two years ago. He said he wasn't too worried during the selloff because he is invested for the long term -- at least five years -- just like Ms. Wood. He opted to load up on more shares.</p><p>Financial adviser Larry Carroll has been investing his clients in ARK's innovation ETF since 2018, buying some $300,000 of shares. He said he likes Ms. Wood and her funds so much that he organized a virtual meeting between Ms. Wood and his clients, many of whom are retirees, so they could hear firsthand about her disruptive investment strategy.</p><p>Mr. Carroll said he put prudent portfolio management ahead of his fandom and routinely sold shares when the ETF moved erratically higher, netting $468,000 in profit for his clients through January. When growth stocks slid, he felt comfortable holding the remaining $221,000 investment, calling it house money at that point.</p><p>\"There's nothing wishy-washy about her opinions,\" said Mr. Carroll. \"Those come through loud and clear and are part of her success.\"</p>",
