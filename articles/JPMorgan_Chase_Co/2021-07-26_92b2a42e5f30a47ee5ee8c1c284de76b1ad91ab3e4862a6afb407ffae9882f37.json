  "text": "<p>Good infrastructure is the backbone of any successful society. The world needs much more of it as emerging economies grow, particularly in Asia, and it must be built on a sustainable basis. If not, we'll be locking in high levels of carbon emissions for decades to come. It won't be cheap, either — an estimated $6.9tn of investment is needed per year by 2030, according to the OECD. Right now, we're not on track to hit this target.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that investors find it hard to tell which infrastructure plans are genuinely sustainable (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54237547-4e83-471c-8dd1-8a8dcebc0382\">Opinion</a>, July 11). That's where “FASTInfra” (Finance to Accelerate the Sustainable Transition) comes in. At its heart is the sustainable infrastructure label, which can be applied to projects that meet robust sustainability standards. This will kick off a virtuous cycle by attracting more investors to this market, and ensuring that private and public organisations design more sustainable infrastructure to meet demand.</p> <p>FAST-Infra is supported by the Prince of Wales' sustainable markets initiative as a strategic partner. Members of the SMI's financial services task force, including HSBC, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Coutts, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan Chase, Lloyds Banking Group, Macquarie, NatWest Group and Standard Chartered, believe the SI label will help build better, greener infrastructure, and make sure that economic growth protects nature, people and planet.</p> <p>The consultation for the label has begun on the Climate Policy Initiative website. By publicly signalling our support for this process, we hope to encourage as many interested parties as possible to contribute to its success.</p> <p><strong>Noel Quinn</strong><br><em>Group Chief Executive, HSBC <br>Chair of the Sustainable Markets<br>Initiative's Financial Services Task Force</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Sustainable infrastructure label will aid investors' FT.com 26 July.
