  "title": "Stocks Close Lower as Jobless Claims Rise; Earlier this week, some investors thought the Fed could pivot from its rapid pace of rate rises, but many dismissed the idea Thursday",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 had soared a combined 5.7% on Monday and Tuesday—its best two-day percentage gain since April 2020. But Wednesday's performance, when all three indexes finished lower, served as a reminder that rallies in 2022 have often been fleeting.</p><p>\"This week has been a really good example of where market psychology is,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"There are risks to the economy and corporate profits. The question is: Are enough of those challenges priced in?\"</p><p>The week's seesaws reflect investors' attempts to wrestle with the U.S. economy's uncertain path as it absorbs the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes. Lately, investors have often interpreted bad economic news as good news for markets, believing that economic weakness will force the Fed to slow its interest-rate increases.</p><p>At the start of the week, weakness in the labor market and manufacturing sector made some investors think that the Fed could pump the brakes on its aggressive rate increases.</p><p>But a series of strong data releases Wednesday, combined with hawkish comments by Fed officials, persuaded many that the central bank's current path will likely be undeterred.</p><p>On Thursday morning, investors decided that bad economic news actually was bad. Initial jobless-claims data showed that claims rose to 219,000 for the week ended Oct. 1, more than the 203,000 that economists expected. Stock futures, which had been trading lower, pared their losses immediately after the data's release, but then turned lower again.</p><p>\"There is a misconception that the Fed will make a pivot as soon as we see an economic deterioration,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. \"The message for us is very simple: The slowdown is happening. It's likely to be a recession. And equities need to start showing a better pricing of recession risk.\"</p><p>Mr. Ielpo said he has been positioning more defensively across his flagship portfolio since August, but last week bumped the portfolio's cash holding up to 75% amid the \"joint collapse of bonds and equities.\" That cash allocation, he said, is the highest since the heart of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020.</p><p>\"I think it's very hard to be optimistic for the quarter to come,\" he said, adding that he believes that a slowdown in earnings is \"barely priced in by the markets.\" Earnings season will kick off in earnest next week, with reports due from companies including JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Bond yields traded higher. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys rose to 3.823%, from 3.757% Wednesday. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to near-term rate expectations, rose to 4.247%.</p><p>Additionally, investors on Thursday said they were digesting the Wednesday agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies to slash output by two million barrels of oil a day⁠—a decision that officials fear could exacerbate inflation and slow economic growth. Brent rose 1.1% to $94.42.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 dipped 0.6%.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.7%. Markets in mainland China remained closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Lower as Jobless Claims Rise</p>",
