  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 322 points, or 0.9%, to 35,788.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX gave up 15 points, or 0.3%, to around 4,645.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP rose 30 points, or 0.2%, to reach 14,837.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow fell 177 points, or 0.49%, to 36114, the S&amp;P 500 declined 67 points, or 1.42%, to 4659, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 382 points, or 2.51%, to 14807.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Comments from several Federal Reserve speakers this week showed central bank officials were thinking about making as many as five interest rate increases in 2022, though three increases is what the dot plot of economic projections by policy makers is currently forecasting.</p><p>That dynamic could offer a tough road ahead for stocks that have previously enjoyed a regime of rates at or near 0%.</p><p>Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller on Wednesday suggested that as many as five interest-rate increases are a possibility in 2022 as the central bank aims to beat back rampant inflation. Though the policy maker said his baseline expectation was for three rate increases on the year, which is more in line with expectations.</p><p>“The three-day U.S. tech rally fell apart, despite Treasury yields moving lower, following a selection of updates from Fed speakers in the past couple of days,” said Ian Williams, a strategist at U.K. broker Peel Hunt.'</p><p>On top of that, U.S. retail sales&#xa0;dropped by 1.9%&#xa0;in December as the omicron variant of the disease that causes COVID-19 spread, undercutting consumer buying. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.1% decline in December retail sales. The figures are seasonally adjusted.</p><p>Such sales activity are seen as a major part of consumer spending and offer cues on the strength of the U.S. economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. industrial output fell 0.1% in December after a revised 0.7% gain in prior month and industrial capacity use edged down to 76.5% last month versus 76.6% in prior month.</p><p>The session in the premarket started off with a focus on corporate earnings, with several major banks including JPMorgan Chase JPM and Wells Fargo WFC each reporting stronger fourth-quarter earnings than forecast.</p>",
