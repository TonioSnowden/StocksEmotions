  "text": "<p>1634 GMT - Pfizer falls 2.4% after it said its drug Xeljanz failed in a six-year safety study. In a study of more than 4,300 rheumatoid arthritis subjects at least 50 years old with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, those who received Xeljanz experienced more major serious cardiovascular events such as a heart attack than those who received rival therapies. The results are likely to reduce prescriptions for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases, according to Citi. However, prior safety concerns haven't hurt prescriptions in the past, JPMorgan says. The firm notes Xeljanz, one of Pfizer 's best sellers, already carries a black-box warning, which regulators may decide to strengthen.

The Stoxx Europe 600 drops 1.2%, the FTSE 100 declines 1.3%, the DAX slips 1.8% and the CAC-40 sheds 1.2%. Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell says pre-Fed anxiety is being exacerbated by a row between the EU and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca over a shortage of vaccines and the International Monetary Fund 's warning on Wednesday about complacency in the financial market. Investors' concerns could ease if the Fed signals it won't be tapering monetary policy support any time soon, he says. \"The alternative, however, could lead to a gory end to January.\" (renae.dyer@wsj.com)</p><p>1641 GMT - Redx Pharma shares rise 10% after the cancer drug developer reported higher annual revenue and said it was on track to hit key targets this year, despite making a wider full-year loss. The company hopes to enter phase 2 trials with its RXC004 tumor drug later this year if safety data expected in the first half is positive, S.P. Angel says. Redx also significantly improved its financial position in the period, as deals with other drug companies drove revenue higher, the brokerage says. \"Alongside in-house developments, Redx struck agreements with AstraZeneca and Jazz Pharmaceuticals , highlighting the continued interest in the group's research &amp; development capabilities,\" S.P. Angel analysts say. (philip.waller@wsj.com)</p><p>1402 GMT - Anthem suggests it will still see significant impact from the pandemic in 2021, when it will push down earnings by around $600M. That includes continued expenses related to Covid-19 care and testing. But some of the cost will be offset by other factors, such as non-Covid medical care still being at a lower level than normal. The insurer suggests it is projecting that Covid-19 vaccines won't be fully rolled out to those in commercial plans until the end of the summer or later, with the rollout for Medicaid enrollees likely a little slower. (anna.mathews@wsj.com; @annawmathews)</p><p>1156 GMT - Siemens Healthineers had a strong start to the year, with signs of a bounceback in the diagnostics division and further evidence of market-share gains in imaging and advanced therapy, Berenberg says. \"While some of the group beat [in 1Q] related to COVID-19 tailwinds, we believe a solid underlying performance has also shaped the guidance increase,\" analysts at Berenberg say, as the company recently raised its sales-growth guidance for fiscal 2021 to 8%-12% from 5%-8%. The first quarter of fiscal 2020 was largely unaffected by the coronavirus crisis, while this year's has been a \"challenging\" one, the bank says. Despite this, the German health-care company still managed to deliver an \"impressive performance\" in 1Q, with sales and adjusted EBIT rising on-year and beating consensus, Berenberg says. (cecilia.butini@wsj.com)</p><p>0934 GMT - Lonza has one of the strongest growth stories in the market, Citi analysts say after the Swiss life-sciences company delivered \"robust\" results for 2020 on Wednesday. The company's growth is supported by its involvement in rolling out the coronavirus vaccine, while Lonza 's expected sale of its LSI business, and how the company uses the funds generated from the sale, will be a key factor for shareholder returns, the U.S. bank says. Meanwhile, Ebitda for the second half of 2020 came in 2% lower than consensus, which was mainly due to costs, Citi says.
