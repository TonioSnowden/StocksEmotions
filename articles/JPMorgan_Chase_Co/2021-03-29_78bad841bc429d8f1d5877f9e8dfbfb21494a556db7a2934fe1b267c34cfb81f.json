  "text": "<p>So much for claims from prime brokers that they hedge their exposures. Nomura and Credit Suisse have warned of large <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/073509cd-fe45-44d2-afac-cace611b6900\">losses</a> after hedge fund client Archegos was forced to unwind assets worth about $20bn amid margin calls.</p> <p>Japan's largest investment bank expects a $2bn loss, which could wipe out profits in the second half to March 31. The Swiss lender — already facing a hefty hit from the collapse of Greensill Capital — anticipates a “highly significant and material” impact on its first quarter.</p> <p>The pair appear to be paying the price for unwary participation in prime broking. Providing muscle to hedge funds is lucrative, risky and dominated by hard-nosed US investment banks. Revenues typically come from spreads on financing. This gives allure to clients that want to leverage heavily, such as “Tiger cub” Archegos.</p> <p>Nomura has been scrambling, as so often in recent decades, to boost fees from outside Japan. That helped lift commissions 22 per cent and net profits 72 per cent in the third quarter.</p> <p>Investment banks talk far less publicly about prime broking than M&amp;A advice or bond trading. Their relationship with hedge funds is symbiotic, sometimes dangerously so. The value of equity collateral can quickly drop below the required percentage of a loan. Smaller prime brokers, such as Nomura, do not even have the cushion of fat profits. Big brokers make margins 15 per cent higher than the least profitable, says benchmarking firm McLagan. </p> <p>Nor does Nomura have a steady domestic retail banking business to support it as JPMorgan and Bank of America do. Net inflows of cash and securities were negative Y195bn ($2bn) in the third quarter. Japan's ageing population is one reason for the deficit. Nomura also faces stiff competition from online discount brokers. The days when its door-to-door sales agents dominated retail financial services are long gone.</p> <p>Nomura shares fell 16 per cent on Monday. A $2bn hit equates to 8 per cent of capital, according to Jefferies. Dividends are imperilled. </p> <p>There is a danger prime brokers across the industry will tighten margin requirements. That could push down stock prices, triggering more margin calls and creating a negative feedback loop. </p> <p>Archegos's stumble subjects prime broking to some long-overdue scrutiny. This is an industry that can too easily cloak bank balance sheet risks - and sometimes hedge fund tax liabilities - from regulators and ordinary investors.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline</em></p> <p><em>Changed after publication to reflect language of McLagan report.</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Nomura/Credit Suisse: mauled by Tiger cub Archegos' FT.com 29 March.
