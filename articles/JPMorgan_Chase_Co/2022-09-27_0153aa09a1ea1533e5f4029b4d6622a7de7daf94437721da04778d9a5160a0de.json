  "title": "Wall Street to Pay $1.8 Billion in Fines Over Traders' Use of Banned Messaging Apps; Eleven banks and brokerages admit they violated rules that require storage of written communications",
  "text": "<p>The fines, which many of the banks had already disclosed to shareholders, underscore the market regulators' stern approach to civil enforcement. Fines of $200 million, which many of the banks will pay under the agreements, have typically been seen only in fraud cases or investigations that alleged harm to investors.</p><p>But the SEC, in particular, has during the Biden administration pushed for fines that are higher than precedents, saying it wants to levy fines that punish wrongdoing and effectively deter future potential harm.</p><p>Eight of the largest entities, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, agreed to pay $125 million to the SEC and at least $75 million to the CFTC. Jefferies will pay a total of $80 million to the two market regulators, and Nomura agreed to pay $100 million. Cantor agreed to pay $16 million.</p><p>Broker-dealers have to follow strict record-keeping rules intended to ensure regulators can access documents for oversight purposes. The firms settling with the SEC and CFTC admitted their employees' conduct violated those regulations.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s brokerage arm was the first to settle with the two market regulators over its failure to maintain required electronic records. JPMorgan paid $200 million last year and admitted some employees used WhatsApp and other messaging tools to do business, which also broke the bank's own policies.</p><p>Regulators discovered that some JPMorgan communications, which should have been turned over for separate enforcement investigations, weren't collected because they were sent on employees' personal devices or apps that the bank didn't supervise.</p><p>Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com</p><p>Wall Street to Pay $1.8 Billion in Fines Over Traders' Use of Banned Messaging Apps</p>",
