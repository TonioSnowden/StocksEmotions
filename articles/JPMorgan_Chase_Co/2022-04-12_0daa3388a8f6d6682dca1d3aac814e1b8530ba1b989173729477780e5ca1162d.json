  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Societe Generale Sells Russian Bank to Oligarch, Takes Big Hit  ----  By Patricia Kowsmann",
  "text": "<p>   French banking giant Societe Generale SA said it would exit Russia, sell its operations to one of Russia's richest people, and take a more than $3 billion hit to its income. </p><p>   The French bank said Monday that it is selling its entire stake in Rosbank and its Russian insurance units to Interros, a conglomerate controlled by metals billionaire Vladimir Potanin.Interros previously controlled Rosbank. </p><p>   The French bank didn't disclose how much it is selling Rosbank for, but said the price includes Interros agreeing to pay off loans Societe Generale made to its Russian unit. </p><p>   Mr. Potanin is the chief executive and owns a nearly one-third stake in MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, which mines nickel and palladium, metals whose prices skyrocketed after Russia invaded Ukraine. </p><p>   Mr. Potanin and Interros have escaped sanctions from the U.S., U.K. and European Union. He was included on Canada's list of sanctioned individuals last week. </p><p>   \"We intend to run the bank's business in accordance with the best standards and practices,\" Mr. Potanin said. </p><p>   French companies largely have refrained from the mass exodus of Western business from Russia following the Ukraine invasion. </p><p>   Societe Generale had until now stuck with Rosbank, Russia's largest foreign-owned lender, with a staff of around 13,000 and 5 million customers. It gave no sign of a withdrawal. </p><p>   However, the pressure on Western financial institutions to sever ties with Russia has been intense. Rounds of sanctions from the U.S., U.K. and European Union largely have targeted the country's financial system and its richest individuals. Banks are reluctant to play a role in facilitating transactions in and out of Russia or with Russian individuals, fearful of running afoul of the thicket of sanctions regulations. </p><p>   Other Western banks also seemed eager to stay in Russia at the beginning of the war, only to decide on an exit as the conflict escalated. Citigroup Inc., one of the biggest foreign lenders in Russia, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Germany's Deutsche Bank AG have said they are leaving the country. </p><p>   Hanging over the banks is the fear of massive fines for facilitating payments or loans that violate Western sanctions. </p><p>   Investors rewarded Societe Generale's move to exit Russia by sending its shares up 6%. </p><p>   The Societe Generale divestment will be closely watched by other businesses exiting Russia. Selling to sanctioned individuals or companies may require waivers from Western governments. Russia has said it would block Western businesses from selling and has proposed legislation to nationalize some Western-owned businesses. </p><p>   Societe Generale said the exit would result in hits to its capital and income, including about $3.4 billion it said would be included in its income statement. The Russian business accounted for less than 3% ofSociete Generale's 2021 earnings, and the bank said it remains committed to paying dividends and buying back shares. The bank said the sale is expected to close in the coming weeks, subject to regulators' approval. </p><p></p>",
