  "text": "<p>International investors are bracing themselves for a wave of defaults on Russian debt repayments, as the Kremlin tightens its grip over the country's financial system following its invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Russia's total debt owed to foreigners stood at $490bn at the end of September, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.ru/Collection/Collection/File/39807/Bbs2201e.pdf\">Central Bank of Russia</a>. But just how much of that exposure — spread across bonds, loans, direct investments and trade credits — will be wiped out is the thorny question confronting international investors. &#xa0;</p> <p>Foreigners own $20bn of the $39.6bn in Russia's outstanding “hard currency” sovereign debt, issued via dollar and euro-denominated bonds. These have plunged in value as the war in Ukraine has escalated.</p> <p>Insurance companies in Taiwan are particularly exposed after investing $4.5bn in Russian government bonds, according to the local regulator.</p> <p>Fitch, the rating agency, warned on March 8 that a default on Russia's sovereign debt was “imminent” following the ratcheting up of sanctions against the government and moves by the US and UK to curb imports of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f98e62e3-7008-4a3e-b835-55568b74ee30\">Russian oil</a>.</p> <p>Prior to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">invasion of Ukraine</a>, Russia was scheduled to pay $4.7bn in interest and principal payments due on its sovereign debt this year.</p> <p>Payments worth $117mn were due to be made on March 16 on two government bonds that have a 30-day grace period, which would allow Moscow to delay repayment until April 15. In the event, JPMorgan processed interest payments sent by Russia for the bonds and passed them to Citigroup, according to a person familiar with the matter, boosting hopes that Moscow can avoid defaulting on its debt. JPMorgan sought US Treasury department approval before sending the funds to ensure it did not contravene US sanctions.</p> <p>In addition, international investors held rouble-denominated sovereign debt worth $38bn, or 19.1 per cent of the outstanding stock, at the end of January. The collapse of the rouble will have a severe impact on the dollar value of these holdings.</p> <p>Foreign investors also own an estimated $21.3bn of Russian corporate bonds, around 22 per cent of the outstanding external stock, according to JPMorgan. Defaults by issuing companies are now widely expected, partly as a result of new controls on capital flows imposed by Moscow, in a bid to hoard cash. Russian exporters must now convert 80 per cent of their foreign currency incomes into roubles which will make debt servicing for companies more difficult.</p> <p>Yerlan Syzdykov, Global Head of Emerging Markets at Amundi, the French asset manager says: “Some of the key commodity exporters will try to make debt repayments while other companies will be given a choice. For most, the choice will be not to pay.”</p> <p>Significant uncertainty surrounds Russian credit default swaps, too — the derivative contracts that provide insurance against non-payment of debt — as the market for them has become increasingly dysfunctional.</p> <p>JPMorgan estimated that the net notional outstanding value of Russian CDS stood at $6bn just before the invasion while Amundi suggested it could be as high as $50bn. &#xa0;</p> <p>Some traders fear that Russian CDS might not pay out at all in the event of a default — and complicated legal battles look unavoidable if Moscow decides that the small print of the debt contracts allow it to repay in roubles, rather than dollars or euros.</p> <p>“It is a very complicated situation,” says Syzdykov.</p><p>Source: Chris Flood 2022 'Russian debt default fears stalk bond markets' FT.com 21 March.
