  "text": "<p><strong>One invitation to start: </strong>just over a week to go until the <a href=\"https://businessofsport.live.ft.com/\">FT Business of Sports Summit</a>, which will be broadcast virtually and close with an in-person dinner in Manhattan on October 14. DD subscribers are <a href=\"https://businessofsport.live.ft.com/page/1740034/professional-pass\">invited to watch for free</a> using the promo code “Premium21” or buy a ticket to join the DD team at the Lotte New York Palace for dinner and more.</p> <h2>Big Law has a burnout problem</h2> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ddaf76a-02bb-4e18-893a-d1fe2429abd1\">we asked</a> if things could get any better for dealmakers. </p> <p>Global M&amp;A <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/a67e0300-98a8-4e29-890a-0949135933ba?\">topped $4.3tn</a> in the first three quarters of the year, on track for a record-breaking year and a windfall of fees for the bankers and lawyers behind the scenes.</p> <p>But as it turns out, it's not just the freshly minted graduates behind the infamous <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jyeu-wvS3Z10xQ0BlMIDOkh_INoP_Nnb/view\">survey</a> that have found themselves <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab0f26a8-bb4c-4fdd-9e2f-b7271e7bf3b3\">“in a really dark place”</a> as of late.</p> <p>Lawyers at London's top firms and those at their US counterparts have also felt the burn of the dealmaking boom, putting in exhaustive hours as the blurring of work-life boundaries during the pandemic further accelerates the M&amp;A machine.</p> <p>More than two-thirds of lawyers reported mental ill-health over the past year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.lawcare.org.uk/get-involved/life-in-the-law\">survey</a> published by mental health charity <strong>LawCare</strong>. Nearly 30 per cent said their work required them to be available to clients 24 hours a day, and 12 per cent reported averaging less than five hours' sleep a night.</p> <p>The deluge of deals and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93a72db1-92b6-4dae-8fc1-f1118f45d543\">high attrition rates</a> have sparked a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa86e22b-06cd-4890-9423-643f316764e3\">talent war</a> as firms scramble to hold on to their existing ranks while enlisting more staff to tackle mounting workloads.</p> <p>But even with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/046d42d1-ec0b-4649-af6a-592430b5668c\">ballooning bonuses</a> and other dangling carrots, a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ed1bc85-2fd0-4f8e-acec-4b35494dbc67\">golden handcuffs</a> is still just that. And the higher the pay, the longer the hours, as the FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/5263685e-7e10-4887-8845-29e6561ca043\">points out</a>.</p> <p>At <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong>' London office for example — where retention bonuses have reached record highs of $250,000 — attorneys toil away until 11.28pm on average compared to 9.46pm last year, survey data from industry site <strong>Legal Cheek</strong> show. </p> <p>The gruelling atmosphere has led some firms to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9477e38a-a1e2-48b9-b2c8-6689465a77ec\">hire “burnout advisers”</a> such as <strong>Jones Day</strong> associate-turned-executive coach <strong>Charlène Gisèle</strong>, who told the FT's Kate Beioley: “Firms want to keep hold of talent and lawyers are dropping like flies from burnout.”</p> <p>Mental health programmes are also becoming more common, such as at the US firm <strong>Reed Smith</strong>, which offers a free counselling service for lawyers and their families and options to gradually alter their workloads.</p> <p>The UK firm<strong> Ashurst </strong>has opened up a “wellbeing space” in its Glasgow office, while others have taken <strong>Peloton</strong> up on its “corporate wellbeing offering” in June, allowing its employees to swap the corporate treadmill for a 30-minute stationary jaunt every once in a while.</p> <p>But can a real-life version of Wendy Rhoades from <em>Billions </em>(who doubles as an in-house therapist and performance coach to the fictional <strong>Axe Capital</strong>'s overburdened analysts), or some company-sponsored endorphins really heal Big Law's burnout? </p> <p>(After a pandemic's worth of stationary biking, Peloton burnout is also<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pandemics-peloton-obsession-turns-to-peloton-fatigue-11633097818\"> a thing.</a>)</p> <p>Probably not. We'll leave the last word to <strong>Elizabeth Rimmer</strong>, LawCare's chief executive: “We need to address the big elephants in the legal mental wellbeing room, the ingrained culture of long hours, lack of management support and the poor boundaries between work and home, and until we do, not much is going to change.”</p> <h2>PE deals: you're paying how much? </h2> <p>Recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7eb6fe55-2a62-43bc-bfba-afae5def9ee1\">we've talked about</a> the large premiums that private equity firms have been paying to take listed companies private (see <strong>Wm Morrison</strong>, which gleaned a cool <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d990b0f-2728-4126-adee-d4111aae7a45\">61 per cent premium</a> from the US private equity group <strong>Clayton, Dubilier and Rice</strong>, and <strong>Zooplus</strong>, for which <strong>EQT</strong> offered a 69 per cent premium).&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Now DD's Kaye Wiggins has <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/69c28c74-e957-4009-912a-aee1c452995d?\">pulled some data</a> to get a sense of just how frothy the market has become. Let's begin with Europe. </p> <p>According to <strong>Refinitiv</strong>, the average premium paid in Europe has reached 45 per cent — its highest level since the data provider began keeping records four decades ago.</p> <p>In the UK it's even higher, at 47 per cent so far this year and 60 per cent in 2020, the latter also being the highest on record. Even the US, where stock markets have performed much better, falls in line with the trend: premiums hit 42 per cent this year so far, the highest since 1999. </p> <p>Is private equity just getting caught up in overall deal prices rising? Not really. Average M&amp;A bid premiums excluding private equity were lower: so far in 2021 they were 28 per cent in Europe, 33 per cent in the UK and 33 per cent in the US, the figures show. </p> <p>It's partly driven by competition. In both the Morrisons and Zooplus deals, there were rival private equity bidders driving each other's bids up, a dream scenario on the sellside. </p> <p>It's also partly because the pandemic has depressed some companies' stocks: if you're paying a huge premium to a Covid-hit share price, it may not be so far above the more normalised value that a listed company's board would expect to see bidders factor in.</p> <p>“There's a theory that ‘these [private equity] guys are crazy to pay so much', but the reality may be that the share price was too low,” said a senior figure at a large private equity firm. </p> <p>Still, there are good reasons to ask what this would all mean if the economy took a serious turn for the worse. </p> <p>Things are feeling a little reminiscent of the pre-financial crisis era, one lawyer who advises the industry said. This time round though, they said, private equity has more tricks up its sleeve to exit investments (like selling to other PE firms who can use financing from credit funds instead of banks, or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee914ea4-4ad9-4eec-97c3-95af841122bf\">selling companies to themselves</a> when they're in a pinch).&#xa0;</p> <h2>Is David Einhorn value investing's comeback kid?</h2> <p>Value investing used to be all the rage, and then the past decade happened. </p> <p>The practice of buying companies on the cheap — whether it was relative to cash flow or net assets — used to be the textbook way to pick stocks, practised by famous names such as <strong>Benjamin Graham</strong>, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> and <strong>Joel Greenblatt</strong>.</p> <p>But, since 2010, growth has been the name of the game. </p> <p>Buy something clipping along at 40 per cent revenue growth a year, but with little profits to show for it, and hold on for dear life. Eventually, the profits will come (<strong>Google</strong>), or it will keep on growing far longer than the market expects (<strong>Amazon</strong>).</p> <p>That has left a lot of value investors bruised. Among them is <strong>David Einhorn</strong>, who rose to fame during the post dotcom crash and became a household name after shorting <strong>Lehman Brothers</strong>. </p> <p>As Alphaville's Jamie Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60cbe9c0-ce7c-42f5-9b49-642e7b879c26\">observes</a>, Einhorn's hedge fund<strong> Greenlight Capital</strong> has had a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4915eafc-959e-11e8-b67b-b8205561c3fe\">torrid decade</a>. Its assets have dwindled to just over $1bn as of January 1, from a peak of about $12bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>But one recent trade seems to have gone particularly well: the department store chain <strong>Dillard's</strong>, whose stock price has skyrocketed since March last year. That seems rather strange, given how much the pandemic disrupted retail. Einhorn explains:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“It's not a great business, but they make some money and they own all of their real estate and it's pretty unlevered and they were buying back stock.”</p> </blockquote> <p>They did <em>a lot </em>of buying back stock. So much so that it reduced the company's share float — jargon for the number shares available for investors to trade. </p> <p>That not only meant more profits per the shares remaining, but fewer shares available to the public should Dillard's stock experience a resurgence in popularity.</p> <p>And that's exactly what happened.</p> <p>Dillard's slowly used its profits to buy back shares on the cheap, and then they became too cheap to ignore.</p> <p>Maybe there's hope for value investors, after all.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Hertz</strong> has named former <strong>Ford Motor </strong>chief executive <strong>Mark Fields</strong> as its interim chief executive. He succeeds <strong>Paul Stone</strong>, who has been appointed as the group's president and chief operations officer.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Julia Kahr</strong>, the youngest person to be named a corporate principal at <strong>Blackstone</strong> and one of the most senior women in her industry, has left the firm to join private equity rival <strong>Cinven</strong> as a partner, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/health-care-dealmaker-julia-kahr-leaves-blackstone-for-cinven?sref=OziMsGoK\">per Bloomberg</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has hired <strong>Marcus Hiseman</strong> as head of corporate banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, based in London. He joins from <strong>Bank of America</strong>, where he was most recently the head of corporate debt and loan capital markets, corporate derivatives, and infrastructure investment banking for Emea.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup </strong>has hired Goldman Sachs alum <strong>Luisa Leyenaar-Huntingford </strong>as its new co-global head of infrastructure, based in London.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Allen &amp; Overy </strong>has hired<strong> Ilona Potiha </strong>as a partner in its US leveraged finance practice, based in New York.
