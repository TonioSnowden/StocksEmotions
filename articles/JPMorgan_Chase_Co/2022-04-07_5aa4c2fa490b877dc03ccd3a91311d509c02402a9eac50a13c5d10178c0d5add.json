  "title": "Zelle Emerges As Rival To Cards",
  "text": "<p>That growth has opened up new possibilities for Zelle and sparked a disagreement among the banks that own it -- a group that includes JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. At the center of the debate is whether it is in the banks' best interest to promote a payment option that competes with card networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Banks collectively earn billions of dollars each year from fees merchants pay when shoppers use credit and debit cards. A payment option that moves funds directly between shoppers' and merchants' bank accounts could chip away at that. But Visa and Mastercard set the fees and take some for themselves, and sidestepping the card networks would allow banks to set rules and fees on their own. Zelle's newfound popularity has some bank executives asking if the service could be the way to do that.</p><p>Wells Fargo and Bank of America are in favor of expanding the service to retail payments, according to people familiar with the matter, eyeing the popularity of such offerings in Asia. Bank of America customers made more Zelle transactions than wrote paper checks for the first time ever last year.</p><p>Executives at JPMorgan, America's largest bank, aren't convinced it is the right time for a Zelle expansion and are urging first more focus on protecting consumers from fraud, the people said. U.S. Bancorp and Capital One Financial Corp. are undecided, they said.</p><p>Banks in favor of the move could try it out on their own, but a vote from Zelle's owners is needed before the service can be activated across all of the banks that use it, some of the people said. Seven banks own Early Warning Services LLC, the company that operates Zelle, and around 1,450 financial institutions offer Zelle to their customers.</p><p>Some banks are reaching out to merchants to gauge interest in a pilot that would allow them to accept Zelle for online payments as soon as this year, the people said. How it would work, what to charge the merchants for the service and what incentives to offer consumers are all being debated, the people said.</p><p>Zelle has already added features that serve businesses and is \"working with financial institutions to explore more opportunities,\" a spokeswoman for Early Warning Services said.</p><p>There is no guarantee such a service would catch on in the U.S., where card payments reign supreme. Large merchants banded together several years ago to offer shoppers a pay-by-bank-account option, but the effort ultimately fizzled out.</p><p>Past failures haven't stopped companies from trying. Discover Financial Services recently partnered with a financial-technology firm to enable bank-account payments over its network.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
