  "text": "<p>US banks have begun injecting legal terms in debt documents to protect themselves against accidental fund transfers in the wake of Citigroup's $900m payment debacle.</p> <p>The new terms come after Citi last year wired $900m of its own money to creditors of the cosmetics group Revlon and later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de433d55-5cea-4929-9954-c08e5b98f004\">lost a legal battle</a> to recoup the funds. The error resulted in the bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/998c61d3-7402-4697-bfb0-84b12f305391\">slashing</a> its fourth-quarter profits by $323m.</p> <p>Now Wall Street banks including Citi are protecting themselves from similar situations by inserting legally binding clauses in the form of accidental payment covenants in debt documents, which allow banks to demand the repayment of any money sent to lenders by mistake. </p> <p>Building materials manufacturer Eagle Materials, pet supply chain Petco and industrial equipment maker Mesa Laboratories have all included a type of “erroneous payment” term in their US loan deals, according to credit documents assessed by credit analysis company 9fin.</p> <p>“This is such a rare thing that has not happened in the US leveraged loan market for a very long time at such a scale,” said Justin Forlenza, senior covenant analyst at credit research company Covenant Review, referring to Citi's blunder. “All the arrangers want to avoid that scenario going forward.”</p> <p>The covenant typically gives banks the discretion to judge whether a payment was mistakenly made and to demand its repayment as well as any interest from the date that the funds were received. Banks typically offer administrative services through which they co-ordinate the payment of coupons and other “back office” tasks related to debt deals. </p> <p>JPMorgan was lead arranger for Eagle Materials and Mesa Laboratories while Citi led Petco's deal. Both banks declined to comment.</p> <p>The accidental payment protection has so far been spotted only in US documents, according to Steven Hunter, chief executive of 9fin, who said it may be because of a quirk of New York's law which allowed Revlon's hedge fund investors to keep the accidental transfer. </p> <p>The judge in that case said the recipient may keep funds transferred by mistake since they did not know it was a mistake and did not trick the sender.&#xa0;</p> <p>Kyle Lakin, capital markets partner at law firm Freshfields, said he “absolutely” expected to see more deals include such terms as it eliminated the small but potential damage risks of accidental payments. </p> <p>Lakin added that the covenants raised the question of what would happen if a lender on a bond or loan declined to pay back an erroneous transfer. </p> <p>“That'll be a flashpoint for investors . . . I'm not sure whether debt investors will accept that they are defaulting if they don't return the money,” he said.</p> <p>Since the start of 2021, at least 10 deals have included accidental payment terms, according to Forlenza, who also expects more deals to follow suit.</p> <p>“This is probably going to become pretty standard . . . There's no harm in putting it in,” he said.</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in London 2021 'Banks adopt new debt terms to avoid repeat of Citi's $900m payment mishap' FT.com 10 March.
