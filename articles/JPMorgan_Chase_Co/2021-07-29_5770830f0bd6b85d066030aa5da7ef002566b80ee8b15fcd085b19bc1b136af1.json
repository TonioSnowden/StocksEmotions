  "title": "SBA to Simplify Loan Forgiveness for Smallest Borrowers  ----  By Charity L. Scott",
  "text": "<p>   The Small Business Administration said it would make it easier for the smallest businesses that got funds from the Paycheck Protection Program to have their loans forgiven, as the agency seeks to wind down the Covid-19 rescue program. </p><p>   About two million business owners with PPP loans of $150,000 or less will soon be allowed to apply for loan forgiveness directly through the SBA instead of their banks. There are about 7.1 million PPP loans that remain outstanding and about six million are for $150,000 or less. </p><p>   Eligible borrowers will receive an email from the SBA with a link to the online portal, said Patrick Kelley, associate administrator for SBA's office of capital access. The application should take less than 10 minutes to complete, he said, and the SBA has created a customer service line to answer borrower questions. </p><p>   Banks responsible for originating the PPP loans must opt into direct forgiveness before their borrowers can use the SBA's online platform, a decision that could potentially limit the initiative's reach. Currently, over 500 banks, representing 30% of qualifying loans, have agreed to let their customers apply for forgiveness using the SBA portal, which begins accepting applications on Aug. 4. </p><p>   The largest bank to opt into the program so far is Customers Bank, which made more than 320,000 PPP loans worth a total of $9.6 billion. The bank, whose average PPP loan was under $30,000, said that the SBA portal \"is the fastest and best way to assure quick approval of loan forgiveness of small PPP loans.\" </p><p>   A spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said the bank hasn't decided yet whether to participate in the program. \"We're evaluating all aspects of the process and meanwhile continue to encourage our customers to apply for forgiveness through our platform,\" she said. </p><p>   So far 75% of the bank's 2020 loan recipients have had their loans forgiven, she said. </p><p>   The PPP, which was created by the $2 trillion Cares Act passed in March 2020, provided forgivable loans to recipients that used the funds to retain workers and on other allowable expenses. </p><p>   The program provided more than $798 billion in coronavirus relief aid to U.S. small businesses. </p><p>   The direct-forgiveness portal, which the SBA says is designed to streamline the process and take pressure off smaller lenders, is a departure from the Trump administration's policy of having banks act as the go-between for the SBA and borrowers. </p><p>   While PPP helped millions of small businesses survive the pandemic, the program was dogged by fraud claims and criticism that it left out businesses most in need of assistance. </p><p>   Mr. Kelley said the previous administration altered the forgiveness process several times in an attempt to respond to those allegations. </p><p>   The SBA is now using a suite of data analytic tools to identify potentially fraudulent loans that then undergo a manual review. </p><p>   The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade association for some of the nation's largest retail banks, said the new forgiveness platform will save small businesses time, while making the program opt-in allows \"lenders the choice to retain oversight of their customer relationships.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Amara Omeokwe contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
