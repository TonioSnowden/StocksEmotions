It wasn't a gift from Daddy.”</p> <p>But the executive's signature brashness — perfectly attuned to the political theatre playing out in the White House at the time — has hit the wrong note in China, where tongue-in-cheek remarks are few and far between.</p> <p>“I made a joke the other day that the Communist party is celebrating its 100th year. So is JPMorgan. I'll make a bet that we last longer,” Dimon told the <strong>Boston College Chief Executives Club</strong>, a business forum, on Tuesday. “I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Dimon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ee3fad6-957d-4410-b5a7-9421ea131e51\">apologised twice</a> on Wednesday, saying that he “regrets” his comments that the Wall Street bank would outlast the Chinese Communist party. “I was trying to emphasise the strength and longevity of our company,” he added.</p> <p>It's a bold comparison. The Wall Street bank with a quarter of a million employees and Dimon's 16-year tenure pale to the 95m-strong institution led by a man who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc8ab2bc-24fe-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0\">lifted</a> China's two-term limit on presidents, setting himself up for a lifetime in power should he choose it.</p> <p>So why say it at all? </p> <p>Perhaps he was feeling confident. JPMorgan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bd19ceb-50ed-4555-a3e3-e06401b77879\">won approval</a> from Chinese regulators to fully own its China securities venture, giving it a sizeable headstart in Wall Street's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">push</a> into the region as Beijing opens its financial markets and ballooning household wealth to the rest of the world.</p> <p>The remarks also followed Dimon's surprise one-day <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2a61edb-10e9-405c-bd82-26c2651a5c34\">visit</a> to Hong Kong, which made him the first Wall Street banking boss to go to the Chinese territory since the start of the pandemic. He also managed to sidestep the city's rigid three-week quarantine rules, typically mandatory for US visitors.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, however, JPMorgan's foray into China may not be going exactly to plan.</p> <p>The bank has battled operational setbacks, strict regulations and towering costs during its investment banking efforts in China, the FT's Tabby Kinder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5426438-bf91-4f64-9b93-067e81925d29\">reports</a>, citing a $40m (Rmb255.5m) total loss over the past two years despite deploying millions of dollars and dozens of bankers in the region.</p> <p>The US lender says it's thinking long-term, though, as Beijing's clampdown on foreign listings places the lucrative fees typically gleaned from Chinese tech IPOs in jeopardy and banks are forced to double down on new revenue streams in the region.</p> <p>“We are building for the future,” <strong>Filippo Gori</strong>, JPMorgan's chief executive for Asia-Pacific, told the FT. “We are not worried if it takes us one year or 25.”&#xa0;</p> <p>It's worth noting that JPMorgan doesn't disclose profitability or performance figures for its activities in mainland China, or the amount of employees it has there — unlike its operations in Hong Kong — leaving DD with some questions on its progress.</p> <p>However those numbers look, Dimon ought to take note of his rivals and tread carefully. </p> <p><strong>Blackstone</strong>'s <strong>Stephen Schwarzman </strong>was offered a crash course in Chinese politics when the buyout giant's attempted $3bn takeover of<strong> Soho China</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19e5002a-7ac8-45c8-ae7c-e33bcf731939\">collapsed</a> in September after the property group's billionaire founders were accused of trying to cash out on their business and “flee” to the US.</p> <p>The failed deal had a “chilling effect” for rival companies planning big cross-border deals for assets considered “strategic” to the Chinese economy, according to a senior M&amp;A lawyer in Hong Kong.</p> <p>With so much capital on the line —&#xa0; some $70tn of investable assets will be available across the country's households by 2030, by <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' estimates — even Wall Street's most powerful bosses are at the mercy of Beijing's tightening grip on the market.</p> <h2>Theranos: Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand</h2> <p>Onlookers gasped when <strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong>, the founder of the disgraced blood-testing start-up <strong>Theranos</strong>, decided to take the stand in her own <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28b24b98-27ad-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0\">criminal fraud trial</a> this past Friday.</p> <p>What came next was less of a surprise: a full-throated defense of her ambition to bring cheaper, more convenient technology to the healthcare industry in the face of evidence that appeared to show she had misled business partners and investors for years.</p> <p>Holmes has appeared calm and collected over three days of direct testimony guided by her attorneys at the white-shoe law firm <strong>Williams &amp; Connolly</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2be33dc4-b4e6-4214-a276-b23a843964cd\">writes</a> the FT's Dave Lee.</p> <p>However, in response to evidence that she presented apparently falsified documents to investors, Holmes admitted that she personally added <strong>Pfizer</strong> and <strong>Schering-Plough</strong> logos to the documents, even though the companies had not signed off on the findings. “I wish I'd done it differently,” she added.</p> <p>The admission still might not be enough to convince jurors that she knowingly misled investors and other partners.</p> <p>“She doesn't have to prove that she's innocent,” <strong>Amanda Kramer</strong>, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at <strong>Covington &amp; Burling</strong>, told DD's Miles Kruppa. “She just has to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors.”</p> <p>Miles will be back in the courtroom next week for the beginning of cross-examination.
