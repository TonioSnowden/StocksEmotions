  "text": "<p>Mr. Neumann was ousted as CEO in fall 2019 after investors balked at WeWork's planned initial public offering. The company at one point sported a $47 billion valuation. But it underwent one of the most spectacular corporate meltdowns of the decade and aborted its IPO.</p><p>The company's valuation tumbled as prospective investors were turned off by its swelling losses, potential conflicts of interest and a perception of erratic leadership.</p><p>\"So yes the valuation made us feel like we were right, which made me feel whatever style I was leading at, was a correct style at the time, so I do think it affected it,\" Mr. Neumann said, adding the chase went to his head.</p><p>\"So when the whole world is telling you that,\" Mr. Neumann said about the company's valuation, \"yes, we believed it and we thought it was really happening.\"</p><p>Mr. Neumann said that Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., personally advised him to step down from the company three days prior to his decision to do so. JPMorganwas underwriting WeWork's IPO in 2019.</p><p>\"He told me, 'Adam, you have done a great job until now but you will have to put the company first,'\" Mr. Neumann recounted. \"I trusted Jamie and I looked up to Jamie. I still do,\" Mr. Neumann said.</p><p>JPMorgan didn't immediately respond to a request for Mr. Dimon to comment on Mr. Neumann's remarks.</p><p>WeWork Inc. made its debut last month on the New York Stock Exchange, capping a two-year journey following its failed IPO.</p><p>When Mr. Neumann left WeWork, he negotiated one of the largest-ever severance packages with WeWork investor SoftBank Group Corp. He received more than $198 million in payments from SoftBank, which includes money paid after a settlement earlier this year, while an entity he controls was able to sell $578 million in WeWork stock at a value above the opening day's closing share price of $11.78, according to regulatory filings.</p><p>To help clear the way for the public listing, he also negotiated with SoftBank to change the terms of a special stock award, entitling him to shares worth more than $200 million so long as WeWork's share price remains above $10, according to the filings.</p><p>Mr. Neumann also said he felt particularly regretful over the employees who were laid off by the company after his departure.</p><p>\"This perception that as the company went from $47 billion valuation down to $9 [billion] and I profited somehow while the company is going down is completely false,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at Talal.Ansari@wsj.com</p><p>Former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann Says He Has Regrets</p>",
