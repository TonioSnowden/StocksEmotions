  "text": "<p>America's biggest banks will learn the results of their latest stress tests from the US Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4f446b1-a71d-4656-a81f-f2bcaf97c9ba\">this week</a>, with a passing grade expected to be a catalyst for billions of dollars in stock buybacks and dividends.</p> <p>The expectation that banks will return more money to shareholders is a sign of how much cash the US banking sector has amassed during the pandemic.</p> <p>The likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have been bolstered by government stimulus and buoyant revenues from trading and dealmaking.</p> <p>The Fed capped dividends and banned stock buybacks last year at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The central bank loosened some of these restrictions at the start of 2021 but still limited the amount of money banks could return to shareholders.</p> <p>“The big banks came into the pandemic looking overcapitalised and after more than a year of no stock buybacks they look even more overcapitalised,” said one analyst.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Wall Street's powerhouses are facing a challenge from Europe's largest retail lender. Santander has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dd3b0b3-936d-4c71-9652-ea0086dbd541\">set its sights</a> on becoming a major force in European investment banking.</p> <h2>Five stories in the news</h2> <p><strong>1. Global equity markets extend losses</strong> The FTSE World index of global shares, which lost 1.9 per cent on Friday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/924a0b7f-12bb-4f16-8190-aad9ccd67d4f\">declined another 0.3 per cent today</a> in response to the US central bank taking a hawkish stance on interest rates and inflation. Monday's moves followed the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fa14ef2-edc0-41bb-870c-303542d6e7c8\">worst week</a>&#xa0;for Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 stock benchmark in almost four months.</p> <p><strong>2. Western powers reignite Beijing anger</strong> Last week's show of force by China in Taiwan's air defence identification zone was the largest number of planes ever dispatched by the People's Liberation Army into the area, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0da3c218-e3e6-402e-b87e-21570bd68ba7\">said officials in the region</a>. It followed communiqués from Nato and the G7 criticising Beijing's activities in the Taiwan Strait and its crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. </p> <p><strong>3. Richest Latin Americans should pay ‘much more' tax</strong> The IMF's top official for Latin America has urged governments to make the rich pay “much more” in tax, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2dc4e9b6-1958-4e30-a444-e6aac230d0b5\">in an interview with the Financial Times</a>, saying the world's most unequal region will not develop unless it addresses demands for a fairer economic system.</p> <ul>  <li><p>Populism and the pandemic have interrupted Latin America's commodity-linked prosperity, says Morgan Stanley Investment Management's chief global strategist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fbdc5e1-dc6e-449b-8140-b88f29f59149\">Ruchir Sharma</a>. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice bids for UK supermarket group</strong> Shares in Britain's fourth-biggest supermarket Wm Morrison <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da5c8b25-3535-41d6-80c4-944340d17e42\">surged 30 per cent</a> following an approach from US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Morrisons rejected the offer over the weekend but CD &amp; R is to push ahead with its pursuit of the grocer despite being rebuffed, people close to the transaction said.</p> <p><strong>5. Raisi wins Iran presidential election by landslide</strong> Raisi, a judiciary chief and conservative cleric, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/031178b4-cb3f-4cfd-9e3f-ea69ebe920eb\">won Iran's presidential election</a> in a landslide victory over the weekend that gives regime hardliners <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d5d641-66a7-41e4-b599-57c16aebaa20\">full control</a> over branches of the state for the first time in almost a decade.&#xa0;Western powers vowed to forge ahead with efforts aimed at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf6259b1-78d8-41d6-96f4-fc666f4efcd5\">reviving the Iran nuclear deal.</a></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>The FT View: </strong>Raisi's landslide looks to be a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f683c99-9f18-42be-8d0b-760ff1a55ca4\">Pyrrhic victory</a>, gathering nothing like the popular support needed to guide Iran through one of its worst crises since the 1979 revolution.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Japan</strong> will allow spectators <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c3c9d36-1f18-4e42-9b84-e15f75b9246e#post-82b8c632-3796-43e8-b689-d32239f1fbe1\">up to 50 per cent of venue capacity</a> at the Olympics, subject to a maximum of 10,000 people, as the government chooses to disregard its medical advisers.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>Delta variant</strong> that swept the UK is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4abbe5e-8650-4a76-9fea-2d3efa2ed52b\">dominant in Portugal</a> and has appeared in clusters across Germany, France and Spain, prompting European health officials to warn further action is needed to slow its spread.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>One of <strong>Cuba's</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/631430f3-cdca-4d19-b1c7-db8655c97465\">vaccines</a> has shown 62 per cent efficacy in late-stage trials, using just two out of the three recommended doses.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Vaccitech</strong>, the group behind Oxford/AstraZeneca's vaccine, believes it has a better chance of <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/2d40c755-81f7-4162-93bb-388e22b53514\">treating cancers</a> than new medicines based on mRNA.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Follow our live coronavirus </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c3c9d36-1f18-4e42-9b84-e15f75b9246e\"><em>blog</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/Bn_05I94SXxMfWJ34_Oxug~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJzaWdudXAtY29yb25hdmlydXM_ZW1haWxJZD02MGE3OTU4MTJlYTM2YzAwMDQ4MjI4YWYmc2VnbWVudElkPTEzYjdlMzQxLWVkMDItMmI1My1lOGMwLWQ5Y2I1OWJlOGIzYlcIZmludGltZXNCCmClP52nYEs8IIFSFmplbm5pZmVyLmNyZWVyeUBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> for our </em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/vGeTqXq8zydeDye-jHuWDQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXVwZGF0ZT9lbWFpbElkPTYwYTc5NTgxMmVhMzZjMDAwNDgyMjhhZiZzZWdtZW50SWQ9MTNiN2UzNDEtZWQwMi0yYjUzLWU4YzAtZDljYjU5YmU4YjNiVwhmaW50aW1lc0IKYKU_nadgSzwggVIWamVubmlmZXIuY3JlZXJ5QGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a><em> newsletter.</em></p> <h2>The day ahead</h2> <p><strong>Activision faces showdown on chief executive pay </strong>Video games maker Activision Blizzard faces a contentious&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2049c3fc-bee9-490a-a317-f406a7419d57\">vote</a> over its chief executive's $155m pay package after delaying the showdown in what critics said was an effort to avoid an embarrassing rebuke.</p> <p><strong>Ethiopia's first ‘free' poll </strong>Today's vote will be prime minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b78dec58-f2f8-40db-93b5-64cbc2586c5f\">first electoral test </a>since sweeping to power on the back of protests in 2018 promising reform.</p> <p><em>How should privacy considerations be addressed given data's emerging status as a tradable commodity?

James Politi, Washington bureau chief, wrote a well reported profile of the academic, whose appointment has sent shockwaves through Washington, Wall Street and Silicon Valley. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e95ad9f5-d9b9-49ec-a71e-8650da5e7ff2\">FT's editorial board</a> says Khan's appointment is an important opportunity to equip antitrust policy properly for the Big Tech era.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Capital for the people — an idea whose time has come</strong> While nobody these days has much sympathy for wealthy individuals or companies or really believes in trickle-down economics, the threat of tax and regulatory arbitrage by other states is real. California is applying some typically creative thinking to this problem, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30e15c56-b770-4d71-8a02-a1867ef7d69d\">writes Rana Foroohar</a>.</p> <p><strong>Behind the scenes at China TV </strong>The&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2948fa5-4f3a-4824-87c2-83b4d4152c0e\">international expansion of CGTN</a>&#xa0;has played a big role in China's soft power push that began in earnest with the Beijing Olympics in 2008. For Beijing, the channel is part of a geopolitical battle for the hearts and minds of the world. Will China become the centre of the world economy?
