  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>We've just passed the first 100 days for the newly-created <strong>European Public Prosecutor's Office</strong>, so I thought it would be opportune to catch up on where things stand with the Luxembourg-based team. They may not be fully staffed yet, but they have been cracking on with cases.</p> <p>Over in Vienna, a further deterioration of relations with <strong>Iran</strong> seems to have been averted for the moment. We're having a look at why the International Atomic Energy Agency decided at the last minute to shelve criticism towards Tehran.</p> <p>And in <strong>Norway</strong>, voting in what has been dubbed as the climate election ended yesterday, with Labour on course to replace prime minister Erna Solberg's coalition.</p> <h2>Billion-euro sleuthing</h2> <p>Since its creation on June 1, the European Public Prosecutor's office has opened 300 investigations with an estimated €4.5bn at stake, according to EPPO spokesperson Tine Hollevoet. “It's quite an important sum,” she said.</p> <p>Unlike the EU's antifraud office, Olaf, the EPPO has the power to lead its own investigations and prosecute cases in 22 of the bloc's countries. Poland, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark and Ireland do not participate in the project (though Sweden is expected to join next year).</p> <p>Hollevoet said prosecutors aim to bring their first indictment by the end of the year, meaning that the first cases brought by EPPO prosecutors could be tried in national courts next year.</p> <p>Some of these cases are ongoing investigations handed over by national authorities when EPPO started its activity, where the cross-border dimension and the EU money targeted gave the Luxembourg-based office the power to investigate. But quite a lot are new cases, including based on tips coming from the public, the EPPO said.</p> <p>In one case in the Czech Republic, three people and three companies are under suspicion of defrauding the EU by filing fake invoices for alleged scientific projects subsidised by the bloc. The main suspect, a Czech national who is in police custody, is accused of setting up a complex web of offshore companies which he used to create fictitious offers and tenders to draw several million euros in EU grants from 2011 until this year. Czech authorities have frozen his bank accounts and seized his assets, which include more than a thousand model trains.</p> <p>In total, authorities have seized assets worth €10m in the 300 cases EPPO is investigating.</p> <p>In a separate case, concerning alleged cross-border VAT fraud worth €14m, police have raided the premises of businesses in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary. Hungarian suspects can be investigated and brought to court in a different country if the case is cross-border.</p> <p>For now, none of the cases are related to the bloc's €800bn post-pandemic borrowing programme known as Next Generation EU. “It's too early still, money has just started flowing and contracts still have to be awarded,” Hollevoet said.</p> <p>As for internal matters, EU chief prosecutor Laura Kovesi has returned €3.5m to the European Commission, as it was earmarked for non-staff expenditure. “We still need 120 staff — case officers, financial investigators — and she doesn't want to spend the money on office plants,” her spokeswoman said.</p> <h2>Iranian crisis, averted</h2> <p>Diplomatic efforts to find a new nuclear deal with Iran have survived to fight another day, after an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4112ec17-8e27-4bc3-abf8-4a49e978f751\">eleventh-hour compromise</a> by Tehran bought negotiators more time to make tangible progress to find an agreement that would lift sanctions on the Islamic republic in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme, writes <em><strong>Henry Foy</strong></em> in Brussels.</p> <p>A threatened resolution by European countries and the US censuring Iran at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's governors in Vienna failed to materialise yesterday, after Tehran made a minor concession on another issue that optimistic delegates seized upon as a sign that negotiations could be possible. </p> <p>Iran had previously warned that a formal censure from the IAEA would bring an end to all talks over restoring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — a 2015 agreement that lifted western sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on the country's atomic programme. That pact fell apart after former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018.</p> <p>IAEA director Rafael Grossi, who flew to Tehran on Sunday, said an agreement that allows the agency to replace memory cards in surveillance cameras installed in Iranian nuclear sites had addressed the “most urgent issue” in their negotiations. </p> <p>But he also admitted that he had been unable to secure “any promise” from Iran in terms of explaining a larger concern: traces of uranium found at sites that Tehran had not declared to the IAEA. </p> <p>The question of whether the camera servicing deal turns out to be the first domino to fall in a chain that eventually leads to a full agreement, or just a stay of execution for a tortured diplomatic initiative, is set to rest heavily on scheduled talks between Grossi and his Iranian interlocutors over the next few weeks. Sceptical IAEA directors will want to see more from Tehran at their next meeting than just a few new memory cards.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: Food price squeeze</h1> <p><em>Food prices have risen 40 per cent over the past 15 months, according to the latest data from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, the biggest gain since surging food prices spurred the unrest of the Arab Spring a decade ago. JPMorgan expects “a purchasing power squeeze on households” that is likely to have already contributed to a dip in global consumer confidence this summer. (</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2daa10e0-4bf1-47e1-b62d-32adf5d5b44c\"><em>More here</em></a><em>)</em></p> <h2>Norway veers left</h2> <p>For the first time since 2001, all of Scandinavia is red, writes<em><strong> Richard Milne </strong></em>in Oslo. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de1258cb-5dff-4130-bf49-64ce730d0d24\">centre-left won</a> yesterday's parliamentary elections in Norway convincingly, gaining 100 seats to 68 for the centre-right.</p> <p>That puts an end to Conservative prime minister Erna Solberg's eight years in charge, and brings to power former foreign minister Jonas Gahr Store.</p> <p>His next task is to form a coherent coalition with disputes on everything from whether Norway should stay in the European Economic Area to how fast western Europe's biggest petroleum producer should move away from oil.</p> <p>The Labour leader's dream government with the rural Centre party and the Socialist Left party is on but tricky discussions are likely.</p> <p>Many called it Norway's “climate election” but for Labour inequality was just as important, with a feeling that the rich had benefited more than “normal people” under Solberg. The Greens, the most obvious pro-environment party, looked to have just failed to come over the 4 per cent barrier needed to gain extra seats.</p> <p>For Solberg, there is satisfaction in becoming the longest-serving centre-right leader in Norwegian history, showing that a Conservative government can be successful even in this supposed bastion of social democracy.</p> <p>Because, for all the jubilation at Labour's party last night, the centre-left party still had its second-worst election score since 1924 even as it came in first place. That is likely to give Store food for thought as he plots his path through the next four years.</p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>European parliament debate on the ‘Fit for 55' climate package</p></li>  <li><p>The Conference on the Future of Europe launches its first citizen panels </p></li> </ol> <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Business-friendly Greens: </strong>Germany's Green party has undergone a three-year transformation embodied by chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock, who has been campaigning on a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc880122-b792-4409-936a-172b73e2daad\">pact with industry</a>” aimed at supporting businesses through the climate change transition.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>OECD deal, take 2:</strong> The Paris-based club of developed economies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/334cf17a-e1f1-4837-807a-c4965fe497f3\">is seeking</a> a new global plan for carbon prices, modelled on its recent success in forging an international deal on corporate taxation. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Pining for Merkel:</strong> Germany's outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel would be the preferred choice for a hypothetical ‘president of Europe', when compared with Emmanuel Macron, president of France, <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/beyond-merkelism-what-europeans-expect-of-post-election-germany/\">a poll</a> conducted in 12 countries by the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank has shown. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Recommended newsletters for you </h1><p>Source: Valentina Pop 2021 'EU prosecutors investigate alleged frauds worth €4.5bn' FT.com 14 September.
