  "title": "As America swelters, these stocks could be heat-wave winners; The U.S. continues to swelter under a record-breaking heat wave that has sparked multiple heat advisories",
  "text": "<p>The heat wave comes amid a long-term warming trend as a result of human activities. Eight of the planet's top 10 warmest years occurred in the last decade, according to NASA, underlining the ongoing impact of climate change.</p><p>While uncomfortable and dangerous, sweltering temperatures can, however, positively impact certain stocks.</p><p>O'Reilly Automotive</p><p>Auto-parts company O'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY, which reports its second-quarter results after market close on July 27, is a potential heat wave winner, according to analysts.</p><p>\"We believe that weather extremes are ultimately positive for auto part sales due to increased stress on parts (think batteries, AC units, etc.),\" wrote Truist Securities analyst Scot Cicarelli, in a note released on Monday. \"Given the heat wave that continues to pound most of the U.S., we believe recent weather patterns have/will likely drive incremental part sales, potentially accelerating 3Q trends.\"</p><p>Truist Securities maintained its buy rating on O'Reilly Automotive, but lowered its price target to $770 from $780, citing the impact of gas prices and inflation.</p><p>See: How to prepare for severe heat, as New York and Washington take their turn at record temperatures</p><p>MKM Partners also raised the possibility of summer heat providing a near-term positive for O'Reilly Automotive. \"Shares have moved higher in recent weeks and are now down only modestly year-to-date,\" wrote MKM Partners analyst David Bellinger, in a note released last week. \"We reiterate ORLY as a top pick within our consumer coverage.\"</p><p>The research firm will be listening to O'Reilly's earnings call for any commentary on the impact of extreme temperatures, particularly in southern states such as Texas, which accounts for nearly 15% of the company's store base.</p><p>MKM Partners has a buy rating on O'Reilly Automotive. Of 24 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 17 have an overweight or buy rating on the company and seven have a hold rating.</p><p>O'Reilly Automotive shares have fallen 2.8% this year.</p><p>Trane Technologies</p><p>Trane Technologies PLC, which describes itself as a global climate innovator, builds air conditioners and climate-controlled systems for transporting refrigerated food, medicine and other perishable items.</p><p>Anyone who has recently experienced food delivery issues as a result of problems on a supplier's refrigeration trucks will understand that these cooling systems are more important than ever before.</p><p>In its May heating and cooling shipment data, the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute reports that shipments of central air conditioners and air-source heat pumps totaled 1,023,666 units, flat compared with the same period last year. However, HVAC — heating, ventilation and air-conditioning — pricing was up 22.1% on year-over-year basis in May, according to Baird Equity Research, citing the U.S. Government's Producer Price Index.</p><p>Opinion: Amid this heat wave, a harsh reality check on using trees and carbon capture to fight climate change</p><p>Trane TT, which reports its second-quarter results on Aug. 3, is Baird's preferred HVAC name. In a note released earlier this month, Baird analyst Timothy Wojs cited the company's historical track record of execution and narrower relative premium versus its peers, which include Johnson Controls International PLC JCI, Carrier Global Corp. CARR and Lennox International Inc. LII. For the second quarter, Wojs wrote, 12% growth is being modeled in the Americas residential category, against an estimated 20% comparable in the year-ago quarter. \"While we can't specifically see what the street models for residential, our overall Americas estimate [at $3.36 billion] is ~2% above the Street's [$3.28 billion consensus] estimate.\"</p><p>While Baird is neutral-rated on HVAC names, Wojs said the space \"could become more intriguing as we consider defensive positioning, easing raws, and valuation pullbacks against a potential recessionary backdrop.\"</p><p>In a note released on Monday, Wojs said that dealer checks show \"still solid\" underlying trends in the space. \"Thematically, [Trane and Carrier are] becoming more attractive with [year-to-date 15% to 20%] underperformance, as commercial activity and improving price-cost could create more resilient 2023 EPS performance against increasingly discounted short-cycle risks (residential/refrigerated transportation),\" he wrote.</p><p>Shares of Swords, Ireland–based Trane Technologies have fallen 31.4% this year, nearly double the S&amp;P 500's 16.7% decline. However, the stock has rallied almost 6% over the last month and is up almost 10% in the last week.</p><p>Of 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet, eight have an overweight or buy rating on Trane, while 15 have a hold rating and two have a sell rating.</p><p>SolarEdge Technologies</p><p>As we adapt to a warming world and attempt to tackle climate change, alternative energy will play an increasingly important role. Cue smart-energy company SolarEdge Technologies Inc., which makes inverters that convert solar power from direct current into alternating current for use in household appliances and lighting and heating systems.</p><p>\"[SolarEdge] is one of the few solar stocks that is consistently profitable, generates cash, and has a solid balance sheet,\" wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Strouse, in a note released last week. \"We believe further penetration of the global solar market and expansion into new verticals should allow the stock to outperform our solar coverage.\"</p><p>SolarEdge SEDG, along with Array Technologies Inc. ARRY, Sunnova Energy International Inc. NOVA and SunRun Inc. RUN, is among J.P. Morgan's top picks in the alternative-energy space. \"We are generally positive on the alternative-energy sector heading into [the second half of the year], owing to secular trends that we believe continue regardless of the economic cycle,\" wrote Strouse. \"Rising fossil-fuel prices and focus on energy security are creating record levels of demand for renewables, in our view, despite lingering supply chain headwinds and rising input costs.\"</p><p>Severe heat: 5 electricity blackout risks facing the entire U.S., not just Texas</p><p>SolarEdge shares have risen 5.7% in 2022.</p><p>Of 26 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 20 have an overweight or buy rating, while five have a hold rating and one has a sell rating.</p><p>As America swelters, these stocks could be heat-wave winners</p>",
