  "text": "<p>Worries about central-bank policy also cut into investors' appetite for riskier assets, analysts said. Minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting showed most officials believe they should begin scaling back easy-money policies later this year. Many investors credit the market's climb over the past year in part to extraordinary levels of central-bank support.</p><p>While the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite managed to rise Thursday and Friday, their gains weren't enough to offset declines from earlier in the week. Losses were particularly steep among shares of economically sensitive companies such as banks, materials companies and energy producers.</p><p>\"We're looking at a period of very strong, but also very uneven global growth over the next couple of months,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The government reaction now looks very different across different parts of the world.\"</p><p>One big question weighing on investors' minds is to what degree inflation, which has jumped this year, will continue accelerating in the coming months and years.</p><p>\"If inflation does prove to be more stubborn, it could change how quickly the Fed has to tighten once they get going,\" Mr. Gimber said.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased about 226 points, or 0.6%, to 35120.08 on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 added 35.87 points, or 0.8%, to 4441.67, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 172.88 points, or 1.2%, to 14714.66.</p><p>For the week, the Dow lost 1.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.6% and the Nasdaq retreated 0.7%.</p><p>Corporate earnings drove swings among individual stocks.</p><p>Foot Locker jumped $3.95, or 7.3%, to $58.34 after the retailer, citing strong sales in its women's and children's footwear departments, posted earnings that surged past analysts' expectations.</p><p>Ross Stores fell $3.46, or 2.7%, to $123.12 after delivering an outlook that disappointed some investors.</p><p>Cyclical sectors lagged behind the rest of the market. While the S&amp;P 500 energy sector rose Friday, it logged a 7.3% decline for the week, its sharpest pullback since March.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of assets that look vulnerable to weakening economic activity extended a recent streak of declines.</p><p>U.S. crude oil slipped $1.37, or 2.2%, to $62.32 a barrel, logging its seventh straight session of declines. Oil prices were stung this week by the strengthening of the dollar, which tends to make the commodity more expensive to holders of other currencies.</p><p>Elsewhere, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.3%. Despite stabilizing Friday, the benchmark ended with its worst weekly decline since February.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite closed down 1.1%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng contracted 1.8%, capping off a tumultuous week for stocksin both markets.</p><p>The selloff in Asia this week was sparked by regulators in China stepping up their scrutiny of internet-technology companies. In addition, several state-media commentaries and articles have suggested that Chinese regulators plan to get tough on more industries.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise on the Day, but Finish Week Lower</p>",
