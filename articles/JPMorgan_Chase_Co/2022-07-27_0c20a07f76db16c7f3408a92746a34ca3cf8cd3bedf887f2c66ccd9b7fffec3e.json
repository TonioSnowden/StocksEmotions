  "title": "Microsoft's Future Outweighs Its Present; Software giant's growth slows after strong run, but affirming double-digit target brings relief",
  "text": "<p>The software giant's fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday showed Microsoft resilient but not immune to the broad economic forces weighing on businesses across the globe. Revenue and operating income both narrowly missed Wall Street's targets despite the company trimming its forecast in June due to the effects of the stronger dollar. Microsoft's crucial cloud segment also came in a bit below expectations for the first time in at least five years, according to FactSet. Still, Microsoft closed its fiscal year with 18% revenue growth—its highest since 2008—and operating margins staying at a two-decade high of 42% for the second straight year.</p><p>Its forecast contained another bit of good news—or at least what passes for good news in the current market. While projected revenues for Microsoft's three main business segments for the current fiscal quarter ending in September were below analysts' forecasts, the company reaffirmed its expectation for double-digit growth in both revenue and operating earnings for the new fiscal year. That still would allow for some deceleration given the slowing economy, while also allowing Microsoft to hit its sixth consecutive year of such growth—a feat not managed since Bill Gates was running the place in the late 1990s.</p><p>That was enough to send Microsoft's shares up nearly 5% Wednesday morning—a nice boost for a stock that had lost a quarter of its value since the first of the year. But the company behind Windows, Excel spreadsheets, the Xbox and now the world's second-largest public cloud service is hardly out of the woods. With inflation soaring, consumers and businesses are tightening their belts. PC unit sales sank more than 15% year over year in the second quarter, according to IDC's estimates—the worst drop in at least eight years. And a survey by Citigroup earlier this month found that chief information officers expect to grow their IT budgets by 2.2% on average over the next 12 months, down from a 5.4% growth projection in September.</p><p>Microsoft isn't even unscathed by the downturn in digital advertising that is hurting rival Google and hammering smaller players such as Snapchat and Twitter. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on Tuesday's conference call that reductions in advertising spending on LinkedIn, search and news hit revenue by more than $100 million during the June quarter and that the company expects the weakness to continue in the current quarter.</p><p>Still, Microsoft's diversity is a relative strength compared with its megacap tech peers. The other four—Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook—are more than 80% reliant on the singular markets of hardware, retail and advertising respectively. And Microsoft's areas of strength are mostly likely to hold up best even in a recession. The same Citigroup survey found CIOs planning to boost their spending on public cloud services such as Microsoft's Azure by more than a percentage point for the next 12 months compared with the last 12 months. In a report Wednesday, J.P. Morgan's Mark Murphy called Microsoft the \"best house in a gradually deteriorating neighborhood.\"</p><p>There are worse things.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft's Future Outweighs Its Present</p>",
