  "text": "<p>Everybody was jumping on the bandwagon of star stock picker Cathie Wood and her Ark Investment suite of funds in 2020, including the flagship Ark Innovation ETFARKK but the tune has changed lately. Add hedge-fund manager Michael Burry  of “The Big Short“ fame to the list of those who may be wagering that Wood's strategies, focused on disruptive technologies, will sour, and there is now a fund in the works with that aim. We talked to them.</p><p>Send tips, or feedback, and find me on Twitter at @mdecambre to tell me what we need to be jumping on.</p><p>Sign up here &#xa0;for ETF Wrap.</p><p>The good and the bad</p><p> Top 5 gainers of the past week                  %Performance  Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury ETFEDV      2.7  iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETFTLT           2.1  Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Index ETFVGLT       2.0  SPDR Portfolio Long Term Treasury ETF SPTL      2.0  Aberdeen Standard Physical Gold Shares ETFSGOL  1.9  Source: FactSet, through Thursday midday, Aug. 19, excluding ETNs and leveraged products.&#xa0;Includes NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe traded ETFs of $500 million or greater</p><p> Top 5 decliners of the past week                     %Performance  Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF PBW              -9.7  SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF XOP  -9.5  VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETFREMX   -8.6  Invesco China Technology ETFCQQQ                     -8.0  Global X Copper Miners ETF COPX                      -7.7  Source: FactSet</p><p>The knock on Wood</p><p>On Monday, we caught up with Matthew Tuttle, Tuttle Capital CEO, a fund provider that looks after less than a dozen funds with about $230 billion under management. Earlier this month, Tuttle filed to launch the actively managed short Ark ETF, which would use the ticker symbol SARK and would be structured as an inverse ETF that uses a complex strategy of options contracts, like swaps, to bet against Wood's flagship fund.</p><p>Tuttle declined to talk about the fund specifically, aiming to avoid running afoul of regulators, because the application for SARK is still being reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and wouldn't likely be approved, if at all, until mid-October.</p><p>Speaking broadly about the shorting strategy, Tuttle said that there is clearly appetite from individual investors who want access to a simple way to take the other side of Wood's bullish bets on companies like Tesla Inc.TSLA, Teladoc Health Inc. TDOC, Coinbase Global COIN, Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, and Palantir TechnologiesPLTR, representing some of its largest holdings.</p><p>“What Ark has done is almost created&#xa0;a whole new sector…you can think&#xa0;of it as unprofitable tech,“ Tuttle told MarketWatch.</p><p>However, shorting individual technology or biotechnology stocks may not give you the type of short exposure you might be looking for.</p><p>Traders who sell shares “short,“ usually borrow them and then sell them, betting they can profit by buying the stocks back later at lower prices. As such, short interest is often taken as an indicator of the degree of negative sentiment among investors in the stocks. Earlier this month, 12% of the total volume of Ark Innovation shares were being sold short, marking a record high short interest, the Financial Times (paywall) wrote , citing data from S3 Partners.</p><p>Ultimately, Tuttle said: “For every major sector or industry there is a long ETF and a short ETF,“ so short Ark Innovation vehicles could be seen more about rounding out the market and offering a wider array of opportunities, to individual investors in particular, than as some vendetta against Wood.</p><p>As for Burry's short bets, Tuttle cautioned that public disclosures about Scion Asset Management, the hedge-fund managers fund, may not reflect his current holdings, since it is just a snapshot at a point in time, as is the case with 13F filings.</p><p>“A 13F is a picture of history. It is not a real-time snapshot. Theoretically when he bought them, he could have made his money and gotten out,“ Tuttle said. &#xa0;</p><p>He also noted that Wood's investment thesis is based on long-term thinking. “She is saying ‘Hey, where is the future?…and buying those companies.“ Tuttle warned that betting against Ark Innovation also isn't a surefire moneymaker.</p><p>“There are lots of forces in the market that&#xa0;could keep things moving in a [bullish] direction,“ he said.</p><p>Ark Innovation is down 7.6% so far in 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 13.6% so far this year, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX was up 17%, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was up 12.4%.</p><p>SPY-ing lower costs</p><p>via CFRAThis year so far, the granddaddy of ETFs, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF TrustSPY, known colloquially by its ticker symbol SPY, saw net outflows of about $5.2 billion in 2021, as of Aug. 13. That represents a minor net exit for SPY but CFRA's Todd Rosenbluth attributes some of that to a shift to ETFs with lower fees.</p><p>It's hard to beat SPYs expense ratio at 0.09%, which means that investors will pay 90 cents annually for every $1,000 invested. However, the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETFIVV and Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETFsVOO both offer an expense ratio of 0.03%.</p><p>Notably, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETFVTI, which also offers the same expense ratio as IVV and VOO, also has drawn in the most money of any fund so far in 2021.</p><p>Buy the dip?</p><p>Bloomberg, VandaTrackAnalysts at Vanda Research note that investors are buying stock market dips more than not and doing so via ETFs.</p><p>“Buying the dip through broad market and leveraged ETFs&#xa0;remains the norm for retail investors,” wrote the Vanda analyst in a research report dated Wednesday. The researchers noted that investors bought $375million in the four most popular S&amp;P and Nasdaq ETFs, including SPY, the Invesco QQQ TrustQQQ, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ TQQQ and the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bull 3X SharesSPXL.</p><p>Good ETF reads</p><p>The age of ETFs is looming, writes the Financial Times  (paywall).
