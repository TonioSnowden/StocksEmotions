  "text": "<p>In individual stocks, shares of VMware jumped 18% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Broadcom is in advanced talks to buy the technology company. Broadcom shares fell 3.7%.</p><p>Stocks have slid in recent weeks as investors debated how aggressively the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to tame elevated inflation. Price pressures have eroded some corporate earnings, but money managers also worry that tightening financial conditions too much risks weighing on economic growth.</p><p>Inflation concerns were exacerbated in recent months as China implemented lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19, adding strain to supply chains. Russia's war against Ukraine has also caused European countries to shift away from Moscow's oil and gas, adding to prices.</p><p>\"This year, we're dealing with several issues, which in and of themselves would ordinarily be the top story in any given year,\" said Hugh Gimber, a global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Yet markets are having to deal with them all at the same time.\" This has lent to heightened volatility, he said.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.827% from 2.785% Friday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, added 0.1% to $112.65 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%. The European Central Bank is likely to increase its key interest rate to zero or above by September, President Christine Lagarde said in a blog post Monday, drawing a line under an eight-year experiment with negative interest rates amid record-high inflation and mounting concerns about the weakness of the euro currency.</p><p>The euro gained 0.9% against the dollar to trade at $1.0659.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performance. Japan's Nikkei 225 added 1%, while South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3%. China's Shanghai Composite was flat, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Open the Week Higher After Nearing Bear Market</p>",
