  "text": "<p>    John R. Tyson, Tyson Foods Inc.'s chief financial officer and son of the meat giant's chairman, was arrested over the weekend after authorities said he fell asleep in the wrong house. </p><p>   Mr. Tyson, 32 years old, was found asleep in a woman's bed at her home in Fayetteville, Ark., on Sunday morning, according to a preliminary arrest report filed by the Fayetteville Police Department. He was arrested for criminal trespass and public intoxication, according to the report, and booked at the Washington County Detention Center. He was released Sunday evening. </p><p>   In a company-wide email on Monday, Mr. Tyson apologized for his actions and said that he is getting counseling on alcohol usage. </p><p>   \"I am embarrassed for personal conduct that is inconsistent with my personal values, the company's values, and the high expectations we hold for each other here at Tyson Foods,\" Mr. Tyson said. </p><p>   A spokesman for Tyson Foods said the company is aware of the incident, and because it is a personal matter it had no additional comment. </p><p>   Mr. Tyson, the great-grandson of Tyson Foods's founder, was promoted to CFO of the $24 billion meat company in September and took over the job at the start of October. He is the youngest chief financial officer serving at a company in the S&amp;P 500 or Fortune 500, according to Crist Kolder, an executive-search firm. </p><p>   Before taking over as CFO, he had been serving as Tyson's executive vice president of strategy and chief sustainability officer, roles he still holds. </p><p>   The company's shares closed slightly lower on Monday. </p><p>   The Fayetteville police report said that the woman told them she believed Mr. Tyson came in through an unlocked front door, and that she didn't know him. The report said that police attempted to wake Mr. Tyson but that, after briefly sitting up, he lay back down and tried to resume sleeping and that there was an odor of intoxicants on his breath and body. </p><p>   Mr. Tyson joined Tyson in 2019, after earning a master's of business administration degree from Stanford University. He has held various roles in investment banking, private equity and venture capital, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. </p><p>   Some have pegged Mr. Tyson as a future CEO or chairman of the company. Mr. Tyson has said he is focused on fulfilling his current duties. </p><p></p>",
