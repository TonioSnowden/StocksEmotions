  "text": "<p>Stocks continued to enjoy a general upswing after U.S. regulators gave full approval for the one of the Covid-19 vaccines, lifting hopes that more vaccines will be administered, bringing the country a step closer to eventually moving beyond the pandemic, analysts and investors said.</p><p>The House's narrow passage of a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that also locked in a September vote on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill also factored into Wednesday's gains, helping to lift shares of manufacturers and materials firms higher.</p><p>At the same time, investors sold bonds, pushing yields lower to the benefit of financial stocks since that helps banks and other firms generate more profits. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.321% from 1.289% Tuesday.</p><p>All eyes are now turning to the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole symposium. The highly anticipated meeting starts Thursday and investors hope to gain fresh insights from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell around the central bank's thinking on fiscal-stimulus tightening and inflation. Money managers are torn over whether the Fed will proceed with scaling back its bond purchases in coming months, given the uptick in Covid-19 cases and some signs that the economic recovery is slowing.</p><p>\"The market is focused on this inflation question and whether it has an impact on Fed policy,\" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. He added that with markets at all-time highs while also facing massive uncertainties stemming from Covid-19, opportunities have largely dried up.</p><p>\"There's so much uncertainty and so many conflicting pieces of information,\" Mr. Martin added, referring to the spread of Covid-19 Delta variant. \"It's difficult to evaluate what happens with people and businesses.\"</p><p>Financial stocks led benchmarks higher. In the S&amp;P 500, the sector gained 1.6%, while in the Dow, shares of Goldman Sachs Group, American Express and JPMorgan Chase all counted as the benchmark's top contributors.</p><p>Industrial and material firms also rose, adding 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Among the gainers, shares of Caterpillar added 1.1%.</p><p>Energy stocks were also in the green, gaining 1% following a third straight drop in U.S. crude inventories.</p><p>Some meme stocks also rose, with AMC Entertainment Holdings gaining around 5% in recent trading.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 index closed little changed. In Asia, major indexes were mixed. China's Shanghai Composite added 0.7%, and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 was relatively flat, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.1%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Higher After S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Hit Records</p>",
