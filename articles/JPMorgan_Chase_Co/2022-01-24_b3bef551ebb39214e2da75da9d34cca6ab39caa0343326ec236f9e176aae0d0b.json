  "title": "VW fired senior employee after they raised cyber security concerns",
  "text": "<p>A senior Volkswagen employee was dismissed weeks after raising the alarm about alleged cyber security vulnerabilities at the carmakers' payments arm, which is soon to be majority-owned by JPMorgan.</p> <p>The manager alerted bosses in September 2021 to concerns that VW's system in the region was “open to fraud” following an attempted cyber attack, and maintained that $2.6m sitting in the company's accounts could be stolen, according to documents seen by the Financial Times. </p> <p>The staff member, who also told superiors that VW could face regulatory action if the vulnerabilities were not addressed, was then fired in October. </p> <p>VW said the information provided proved to be “irrelevant” and that “the employee was terminated due to fundamental differences in the way we work together”. </p> <p>Since it was found in 2015 to have manipulated emissions tests for diesel engines that were installed in 11m cars, Volkswagen has stressed that its internal culture is being reformed to ensure employees with concerns can come forward without fear of reprisals.</p> <p>The company appointed a board member who was solely responsible for integrity and legal affairs, and established a Together4Integrity programme, which is designed to ensure wrongdoing is reported. </p> <p>One of the scheme's stated aims is <a href=\"https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/group/together4integrity.html\">to foster a “speak-up environment,”</a> in which VW will “encourage, protect and value the reporting of concerns and suspected wrongdoing”.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>This employee's concerns surrounded Volkswagen Payments SA, a payments platform established in 2017 that was a wholly owned subsidiary of VW's financial services business, which provides financing to dealers and customers. </p> <p>According to its website, the aim of the <a href=\"https://www.europe.fspay.de/ewallet/Landing?returnUrl=%2Fewallet%2F\">world's second-largest automaker is to make the payments platform</a>, which accepts credit card and PayPal payments and can process in-car purchases “available globally for the entire Volkswagen Group” including car and truck brands such as Audi, Porsche and Scania, as well as “local subsidiaries and importers”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The system has already been used to accept deposits for pre-orders of VW's flagship electric models.</p> <p>On September 8, <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/news/jpmorgan-to-take-majority-ownership-of-volkswagen-payments-business\">JPMorgan announced</a> it would buy a 75 per cent stake in Volkswagen Payments SA, which is based in Luxembourg, “to meet evolving customer expectations in the auto space and beyond”. </p> <p>Later that month, the VW employee told bosses they were concerned about the risks posed by what they called a “fraud event” that had taken place three days after JPMorgan's announcement, on September 11, according to internal communications seen by the Financial Times. </p> <p>“We need to have some kill switches to limit the damage to [sic] these sorts of attacks,” the person wrote, adding that they expected more hacking attempts to be made.</p> <p>VW said there “was no case of fraud”. The company added: “As a matter of principle, we follow up all safety information from our employees immediately and conscientiously.”</p> <p>A person close to VW said the division hired an external law firm to look into the concerns raised.</p> <p>JPMorgan declined to comment. </p> <p>VW was hailed as a “better organisation” by the former US deputy attorney-general Larry Thompson 16 months ago, after his three-year stint as the Department of Justice appointed compliance monitor of VW ended.</p> <p>“The structures and processes in place and the commitments at all levels of the company . . . can make Volkswagen a long-term and sustainable ethics, integrity and compliance success,” the former Enron prosecutor added.</p><p>Source: Joe Miller in Frankfurt 2022 'VW fired senior employee after they raised cyber security concerns' FT.com 24 January.
