  "title": "Big banks to pay more than $1 billion for 'widespread and longstanding failures' in keeping text-message records; More than a dozen firms admit to not keeping up with employees' messages in settlement with Securities and Exchange Commission",
  "text": "<p>\"Today's actions — both in terms of the firms involved and the size of the penalties ordered — underscore the importance of record-keeping requirements: they're sacrosanct,\" the director of the SEC's enforcement division, Gurbir Grewal, said in a statement. \"If there are allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct, we must be able to examine a firm's books and records to determine what happened.\"</p><p>The SEC said that the banks failed to collect communications from employees' private devices and messaging apps that involved business matters from January 2018 to September 2021, across all levels of authority within their organizations. In addition to paying fines, the banks \"have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to settle these matters,\" the SEC stated.</p><p>The eight banks joining JP Morgan in paying $125 million are Barclays PLC UK:BARC; Bank of America Corp. BAC, along with Merrill Lynch; Citigroup Inc. C ; Credit Suisse Group AG CH:CSGN ; Deutsche Bank AG XE:DBK; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS; Morgan Stanley MS and UBS Group AG UBS. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. JEF and Nomura Holdings Inc. JP:8604 will pay $50 million, while Cantor Fitzgerald Inc. will pay $10 million.</p><p>They have all been charged with violating record-keeping provisions and failing to properly supervise, according to the SEC. The firms also reached agreement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on similar charges, the SEC announced, without providing further detail.</p><p>The agency also disclosed that the investigation continues.</p><p>\"Other broker dealers and asset managers who are subject to similar requirements under the federal securities laws would be well-served to self-report and self-remediate any deficiencies,\" Grewal said in his statement.</p><p>Big banks to pay more than $1 billion for 'widespread and longstanding failures' in keeping text-message records</p>",
