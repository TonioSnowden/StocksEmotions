  "title": "Government Losses on Student Debt Climb Above $100 Billion Amid Pause on Payments; Congressional Republicans ask for details on costs amid moratorium on loan repayments",
  "text": "<p>Among the documents requested is an internal report commissioned by Betsy DeVos, former education secretary under the Trump administration, that showed a far more dire picture of taxpayers' exposure to student-loan defaults than the one presented by the government.</p><p>Biden Education Department officials have disputed the findings of that report. In congressional testimony last October, Richard Cordray, the head of Federal Student Aid at the Education Department, said, \"There's some question whether the methodology used in that particular report…was the most accurate.\" In November testimony, Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal told Ms. Foxx that the Department would send over requested documents within a month, but that hasn't happened.</p><p>\"If you disagree with the reports, as Mr. Cordray seems to believe, then you should make the reports and contractors available to discuss that and examine the problems in their methodology,\" the Republicans wrote in their letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona.</p><p>\"For months we have been asking the Department of Education to provide us with reports assessing the true cost of the federal student loan portfolio, but have been stonewalled by Secretary Cardona and those under him,\" Ms. Foxx said in a statement.</p><p>Ms. Foxx's staff has had meetings with Education Department officials to discuss student-loan portfolio accounting, and the Department said Wednesday that it was providing lawmakers with accurate information about the loans.</p><p>\"For the last several months, department staff have sought to address members' questions about the federal student loan portfolio and to clarify the methodology used to assess its size and value,\" an Education Department representative said.</p><p>When cash flows from student-loan programs don't match expectations set in annual budgets, other government accounts fund the difference, outside of the congressional appropriations process. The amount set aside for that purpose in the direct loan program, which accounts for the vast majority of government-held student debt, has risen rapidly in recent years, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In fiscal year 2019, the Federal Student Aid office of the Education Department projected the need for a $124.5 billion infusion. In fiscal year 2021, that number had risen to $273.8 billion. Roughly two-thirds of that increase can be attributed to the current moratorium: The net cost of the pause came to $98.4 billion for the fiscal years of 2020 and 2021, according to the Education Department's annual financial report.</p><p>The study requested by congressional Republicans was conducted by a former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. executive in early 2020 and has been seen by The Wall Street Journal. It found that Congress, multiple presidential administrations and government watchdogs had systematically made the student-loan program look profitable when in fact defaults were becoming more likely.</p><p>It used a different methodology for calculating borrowers' ability to repay loans and concluded that they would pay back $935 billion in principal and interest. That would leave taxpayers on the hook for $435 billion. All of those estimates reflect pre-pandemic conditions.</p><p>The losses projected in that report are far steeper than prior government projections, which typically measure how much the portfolio will cost the government in the next decade, not the entire life of the loans.</p><p>In its 2022 budget, released last June, the Biden administration raised its estimate of losses on the federal government's student-loan portfolio by $53 billion, reflecting lower repayment rates and pandemic-relief efforts. A year earlier, the federal budget projected an ultimate $15 billion loss on all outstanding student debt. The budget now projects long-term losses of $68 billion.</p><p>The current pause on loan repayments and interest accrual has been extended multiple times, most recently in December when the administration pushed back a Jan. 31 resumption date to May 1 because of surging Covid-19 cases from the Omicron variant.</p><p>About 43 million people owe $1.6 trillion in federal student debt, Education Department data show. About 5.2 million borrowers are in default—meaning they have gone nearly a year without making a payment—on about $114 billion in student debt.</p><p>\"Presumably the people not paying today will be in a better financial position when payments restart,\" said Adam Looney, who served as a Treasury Department official in the Obama administration, given the rise in savings over the pandemic, especially for workers with college educations who were more likely to be able to work remotely.</p><p>In November, the Education Department said it was ending its relationship with private collection agencies that had been tasked with recovering payments from federal student loan borrowers in default to improve collections and provide borrowers with more support. It is in the midst of overhauling a student-loan forgiveness program to make it easier for more public-sector workers to qualify for debt relief</p><p>The Department also has taken steps to forgive billions in debt held by disabled borrowers, as well as borrowers who went to institutions that federal regulators say practiced deceptive recruiting practices.</p><p>Many Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have urged the Biden administration to forgive student-loan debt up to $50,000 per borrower. Mr. Biden has said he doesn't have the authority to forgive that amount and hasn't made moves toward broad-based loan forgiveness.</p><p>Write to Gabriel T.
