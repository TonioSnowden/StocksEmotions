  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>the Istanbul-based grocery delivery app <strong>Getir</strong> has raised $550m in new funding — <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/3acc197c-cd81-4b3b-a19b-32e58fc687e7\">tripling its valuation</a> to $7.5bn, including the new capital, barely three months after its last financing.</p> <h2>The private equity firms buying into each other's deals&#xa0;</h2> <p>DD has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb4f8b5a-07c9-4880-a220-f4f5c56d4735\">told you before</a> about the close relationship between <strong>KKR</strong> co-founder <strong>George Roberts</strong> and <strong>Egon Durban</strong>, co-head of <strong>Silver Lake</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Roberts, 77, has taken to mentoring his fellow private equity billionaire Durban, who is three decades his junior, the FT reported last year. Durban takes holidays near Roberts in Hawaii.&#xa0;</p> <p>The timeline of a couple of recent deals suggests that the personal closeness between the private equity firms' most senior figures is now finding a parallel in business. The groups are putting money into each other's deals. Let's take a look . . . </p> <p>June 1: Silver Lake announces a minority investment in the Dutch software company <strong>Exact</strong>. KKR is the majority shareholder. A <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210531005304/en/Silver-Lake-Announces-Strategic-Investment-in-Exact\">press release</a> announcing the deal includes quotes from, among others, <strong>Jean-Pierre Saad</strong> from KKR and <strong>Christian Lucas</strong> from Silver Lake.&#xa0;</p> <p>June 3: KKR announces it's taking a minority stake in the French software company <strong>Cegid</strong>. Silver Lake is the majority shareholder. The <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602006160/en/KKR-to-make-Investment-in-Cegid-valuing-the-Company-at-%E2%82%AC5.5-Billion\">press release</a> includes quotes from, among others, Saad and Lucas. It doesn't disclose the size of KKR's stake — but it does say the deal values Cegid at €5.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The firms have a history of being involved in the same deals. Both invested in the semiconductor firm <strong>NXP</strong> and the martial arts league <strong>UFC</strong>. KKR <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27b2b3e6-5bb2-448c-9bf2-f7d796787bbc\">agreed to bankroll</a> billionaire <strong>Mukesh Ambani</strong>'s <strong>Jio Platforms</strong> shortly after Silver Lake agreed to invest in Jio last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>But DD can't recall a time when their dealmaking has been quite so mirror image.</p> <p>Investors usually care about one thing above all: maximising returns. Private equity firms often try to do that by running a competitive process when they sell a portfolio company, or a stake in one of them. But there can be legitimate reasons for taking a different approach.</p> <p>People familiar with the transactions, who declined to be named, said both buyout groups had talked to, or received expressions of interest from, other parties.&#xa0;</p> <p>When DD asked KKR and Silver Lake whether a competitive process took place, neither provided a comment for publication.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD has a lot of readers in the private equity world.

He is best known for his prowess as a technology investor. His other firm, <strong>Partner Fund Management</strong>, which had $6bn of assets at its peak, ranked as one of the biggest hedge funds on the West Coast.</p> <p>Then there's <strong>Charlie Penner</strong>, James's right-hand man, who spent 15 years at the activist hedge fund <strong>Jana Partners</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphones-and-children-are-a-toxic-pair-say-two-big-apple-investors-1515358834\">tackling</a> corporate giants such as <strong>Apple </strong>and <strong>Qualcomm</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>While at Jana, Penner launched an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, fund that would count the rock star <strong>Sting</strong>, his wife <strong>Trudie Styler </strong>and <strong>Sister Patricia Daly</strong>, a nun and activist, as advisers. But it never really took off. Then he saw an opportunity to start a firm focused exclusively on impact investing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Daly has been a recurring presence at Exxon shareholder meetings arguing for more disclosure on emissions <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/magazine/12exxon-t.html\">since the 1990s</a>.</p> <p>The fund's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2efa8072-09df-4da0-bb44-185126df622e\">zealous methods</a> for breaking into Exxon's boardroom <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da6dec6a-6c58-427f-a012-9c1efb71fddf\">have proven effective</a>. Engine <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/engine-no-1-win-third-seat-exxon-board-based-preliminary-results-2021-06-02/\">successfully installed</a> its third nominee this week, the venture capital investor <strong>Alexander Karsner</strong>.</p> <p>Aside from doing the right thing for the planet, what's in it for Engine No 1?</p> <p>The economics are questionable. Engine <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001387131-21-002440/\">reported</a> owning 917,400 shares of Exxon stock at the end of March, a stake worth about $51m at the time.</p> <p>Factor in the $30m Engine spent on its campaign — contributing to arguably one of the most expensive proxy battles in history — and any profit gleaned from its shares is likely voided. Unless, as is the case with many proxy battles, the losing party will be required to cover the winner's costs.</p> <p>Perhaps there's more to it than money. Engine may have solidified its reputation as a small but mighty activist, which will surely help when it markets itself to outside investors. Retail investors could be wooed to invest in the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1831313/000110465921074329/tm2117663-1_n1aa.htm\">exchange-traded fund</a> it has in the works.</p> <p>The hedge fund also won over the influential advisory firms <strong>Glass Lewis</strong> and<strong> Institutional Shareholder Services</strong> and top shareholders including<strong> Calstrs</strong>, the second-largest US retirement fund, and <strong>BlackRock </strong>during its Exxon attack.</p> <p>These are powerful friends for Engine to have in its pocket if it's planning another campaign anytime soon.</p> <h2>UK start-ups stage a Brexit for the US Spac market</h2> <p>The UK tech sector is booming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9442066-1bbe-4cb3-b668-af6a9958a324\">with some $8bn flowing</a> into start-ups in the first quarter alone.&#xa0;</p> <p>But keeping hold of those companies might become a problem for Britain.&#xa0;</p> <p>Several UK start-ups have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/530b1921-5689-4770-853a-0d876ee5fe77\">opted to list</a> in the US through deals with special purpose acquisition companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>The latest is the health firm <strong>Babylon</strong>, which yesterday announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d41a17ca-8b06-4cb4-91f0-a410e52bf7a8#comments-anchor\">$4.2bn blank-cheque deal</a> with <strong>Alkuri Global</strong>, a Spac set up by former <strong>Groupon</strong> chief executive <strong>Rich Williams</strong>.</p> <p>The company is following in the footsteps of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/309b509e-1aa4-48a8-9e69-54d272f8807b\">electric vehicle</a> maker <strong>Arrival</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9d21ee4-c94a-4b10-aef8-532bf11fcc4f\">used car dealer</a> <strong>Cazoo</strong> and <strong>Arqit</strong>, the UK quantum cyber security business.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the main reasons UK companies are opting to list in the US is that London has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1224cfc3-c431-415e-9216-6cb3ab8f78d5\">slow to reform its rules</a> on blank-cheque companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>In Babylon's case, the deal gives the company an enterprise value of $3.6bn and $575m in gross proceeds. That includes $270m in private placement from new investors, among them <strong>Palantir</strong>, the controversial data-analytics firm co-founded by <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Much like other recent deals we've seen, the Babylon-Alkuri tie-up failed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffe2e371-cc9e-41cc-94d4-b6d3446b6ed7\">get a “pop”</a> for its stock price. In fact, shares in the company hardly moved. They're currently trading around $9.85 — a discount to the $10 price at which investors, including so-called Pipes, buy into the transaction.&#xa0;</p> <p>The lacklustre share performance could lead to increased redemptions when the shareholder vote rolls around. Why hold on to stock that trades at $9.85 if you can get your full $10 back?</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Rothschild &amp; Co</strong> has appointed <strong>Tim Eastwood</strong> to lead a new wealth management team across the English Midlands, based in Birmingham. He joins from <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>, where he was head of ultra-high net worth UK clients.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges </strong>made two new hires in its Washington, DC office from <strong>Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher</strong>:<strong> Drew Tulumello</strong> has joined as a senior partner and co-head of complex commercial litigation, and <strong>Chantale Fiebig</strong> has joined as a partner in the same practice.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Battle of the books</strong> Amazon's arsenal of ecommerce and eBooks has all but extinguished its prey. The strongest brick-and-mortar players and their hedge fund owners Elliott Management have placed their odds at survival in the hands of one executive.

Yet the delegates often hail from the very same companies they're meant to be policing. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/world/europe/climate-change-un-international-maritime-organization.html\">New York Times</a>)</p> <p><strong>Business or pleasure? </strong>The answer to the question could be both, for many post-pandemic freelancers. Hotels are adapting to a new set of “digital nomads”, offering long-stay options, while banks and other traditional employers try to reign in the wanderlust.
