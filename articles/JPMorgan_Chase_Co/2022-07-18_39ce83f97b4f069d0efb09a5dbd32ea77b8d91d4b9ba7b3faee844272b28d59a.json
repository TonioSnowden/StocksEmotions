  "title": "Earnings Season's Slow Start  Clouds Stock-Market Outlook  ----  By Karen Langley and Pia Singh",
  "text": "<p>   Investors hoping a strong start to earnings season would jolt the stock market from its slump haven't gotten much satisfaction. </p><p>   Early reports from U.S. companies have refocused attention on some of the biggest challenges facing businesses, from the threat of an economic slowdown to the pressure that rising costs are putting on corporate profits. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Delta Air Lines Inc. and industrial supplier Fastenal Co. are among those last week that warned they are facing strains or see clouds ahead. </p><p>   The lackluster corporate results, together with a fresh inflation reading at yet another four-decade high, pulled major indexes lower as investors braced for the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates again. Even after staging a big rally Friday, the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.9% last week, bringing its losses this year to 19%. </p><p>   \"It's been an inauspicious start to earnings season so far,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \"You're starting to see some pressure on the expense line due to inflation.\" </p><p>   Of the 7% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far, 60% have beaten earnings expectations, below the average of 77% over the past five years, according to FactSet. Since the end of March, analysts have lowered their quarterly profit growth estimates to 4.2% from 5.9%. </p><p>   To be sure, investors are confronting mixed signals about the outlook for individual companies and the economy as a whole. Bank stocks led the market Friday, recovering some of their steep year-to-date losses. Citigroup Inc. shares, for example, climbed 13% after the bank posted stronger results than feared and said preparations for potential bad loans in a recession pulled its profit down. Meanwhile, new data showed U.S. retail sales rose 1% in June, a sign of strong household finances despite high inflation. </p><p>   Investors plan this coming week to scrutinize the next set of results from a range of companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., Netflix Inc. and Tesla Inc. They plan to parse data on jobless claims to assess how the labor market is holding up as high inflation and rising rates drag on the economy. </p><p>   Earnings growth is key to the market's trajectory as rising interest rates have eroded investors' calculations of what stocks are worth. Back in early 2020, the Fed slashed interest rates to support an economy battered by Covid-19. Those low rates drove equity valuations sharply higher, fueling a stock market rally that pushed major indexes to dozens of records as investors grew optimistic about companies' ability to profit despite the pandemic. </p><p>   Faced with tightening monetary conditions, investors have dialed back the multiples they are willing to pay for a slice of company earnings. The S&amp;P 500 traded last week at 16 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, down from 21.5 times at the end of last year, according to FactSet. </p><p>   With Fed officials expected to continue aggressively raising rates, few analysts expect stock multiples to meaningfully expand in the near future. That leaves corporate profits as a potential impetus for stocks to change course and start recovering their losses. </p><p>   But as inflation pinches margins and disheartens consumers, many investors are skeptical that robust earnings growth is in store. Some question the Wall Street profit outlooks that are commonly used to assess the value of company shares. Analysts expect that earnings from S&amp;P 500 companies will rise 9.9% in 2022, FactSet estimates show. </p><p>   \"They're clearly too high,\" Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust, said of earnings expectations. \"The question is: How far from the actual results are we currently?\" </p><p>   The latest earnings season kicked off in earnest this past week with reports from big banks, which investors turn to for clues about the state of the economy. Morgan Stanley missed earnings expectations as corporate deal-making fell, while Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reported a slump in profit as rising interest rates hit its mortgage business and the value of equity investments fell. </p><p>   JPMorgan also posted a lower profit and said it sees few signs a recession is imminent, even as heightened uncertainty led it to set aside more money to prepare for the possibility of future loan losses. Its shares dropped 3.5% the day of its report. </p><p>   \"It's just evidence that it's now a widespread view that inflation has damaged the economy and the Fed's actions to try to prevent it from getting worse are going to challenge economic growth and thus earnings growth,\" said David Bianco, chief investment officer for the Americas at asset manager DWS Group. </p><p>   Earlier in the week, Delta cited higher costs and acknowledged stumbling as it tried to cope with strong demand by passengers. The airline's profit fell short of expectations. Separately, Fastenal said there were signs of softening demand. </p><p>   Investors are looking to the coming weeks to reveal winners and losers in the contest to maintain profits as costs rise. </p><p>   Some of the gloomier outlooks for the market hinge on a growing concern: That as the Fed continues to raise rates, the economy will enter a recession. BofA Global Research last week cited its expectation for a mild recession as it cut its year-end forecast for the S&amp;P 500 to 3600, representing a 6.8% decline from Friday's close. </p><p>   Still, some investors think worries about an economic slowdown are overblown, a view that allows for the possibility that much of the bad news for stocks could already be reflected in market prices. Household finances are in good shape, and employers continue to add jobs each month. </p><p>   \"The fear about recession simply doesn't make sense with job growth where it is, with consumer spending growth where it is,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. </p><p></p>",
