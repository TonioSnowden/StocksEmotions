  "text": "<p>The firm had previously expected a 7.5% increase in ad spending in Russia this year from projected 2021 figures, for a prior 2022 forecast of $6.89 billion.</p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted a slew of Western companies to re-evaluate their businesses in the country. Fast-food chains, energy companies, retailers and banks have said they are pausing or ending operations in Russia. Some companies, including Google, have suspended advertising sales there. Ad giant WPP PLC and other advertising holding companies have also said they would discontinue operations in Russia.</p><p>Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. in early March said it was putting at least a temporary stop to running ads targeting users in Russia and wouldn't run ads anywhere from advertisers within Russia. The Russian government has said that it is blocking access to Facebook in response to restrictions it said the social-media giant placed on Russian media outlets.</p><p>The Insider Intelligence report assumes Russian gross domestic product will fall 7% this year, citing J.P. Morgan expectations.</p><p>\"The war in Ukraine will have an impact on ad spending in Russia because of the economic fallout of the war itself, as well as all the sanctions that have been imposed on Russia,\" said Oscar Bruce Jr., senior forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence, who also cited moves by international companies to pull business from the country or pause ad spending.</p><p>Magna, a media unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., this week revised its outlook for the U.S. ad-market outlook citing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The firm reduced its 2022 growth forecast by a percentage point, saying it believes media owners' advertising revenue will grow by 11.5% to reach $320 billion.</p><p>Magna said the geopolitical crisis leads it to \"anticipate lower-than-expected economic activity, continued supply issues and protracted inflation.\"</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>Ad Spending in Russia Seen Falling by Nearly Half This Year</p>",
