  "title": "Business News: Windfall Taxes Are the Latest Hit on Europe's Banks",
  "text": "<p>Banks in Europe have long struggled with anemic growth and slim profit margins. Even the continent's larger lenders have market values that are a fraction of those of U.S. giants such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>A big part of the challenge: years of negative central-bank interest rates. Subzero rates cut banks' margins on loans and made them unattractive for investors, since the lenders struggled to earn returns above their cost of capital.</p><p>Rising rates had looked like a light at the end of the tunnel. Banks are usually beneficiaries in such an environment, since they can increase the rates they charge borrowers faster than they lift payouts to depositors.</p><p>Germany's Commerzbank AG said it could take a revenue hit of as much as 290 million euros, equivalent to $290 million, in the third quarter from its business in Poland. Its second-quarter revenue was 2.4 billion euros. Spain's Banco Santander SA could potentially lose more than 1 billion euros in revenue through 2023 from Spain's and Poland's moves, according to analysts. Last year, the bank made 8.6 billion euros in revenue from both countries.</p><p>\"The first thing that worries me is that the sector is stigmatized,\" Santander Chief Executive Officer Jose Antonio Alvarez said after the Spanish plan was unveiled. \"Regardless of who is affected by the tax, inflation cannot be fought with taxes.\"</p><p>Shares of banks in both Spain and Poland fell after the plans were unveiled.</p><p>In other areas too, European governments are acting quickly when judging companies to be earning abnormally large profits. The U.K. has said it would introduce a windfall tax on energy companies, and Spain is imposing a similar levy as well as the new tax on banks. Such regulatory risk for investors helps explain why returns on European stocks have long lagged behind those on their U.S. equivalents.</p><p>Investors should consider lenders as like utility companies, providing relatively low but stable returns in forms of dividends, said Marco Troiano, head of financial institutions at ratings firm Scope Ratings.</p><p>\"Profitability in the sector is pretty much regulated by the government,\" following the global financial crisis, Mr. Troiano said, adding that while banks are being punished now, they received state support in the pandemic and other crises.</p><p>Skyrocketing inflation is forcing the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities to increase interest rates. In turn, those higher borrowing costs are further squeezing families and companies as they contend with soaring prices. As governments step in with relief measures, they are tapping banks for money and relief for borrowers.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told Parliament in July that given big banks were already starting to benefit from interest-rate rises, they should be taxed. Under the plan, which needs to be approved in Parliament, Madrid expects to get 1.5 billion euros in each of 2022 and 2023 by imposing a 4.8% charge on banks' net interest income and net commissions.</p><p>Spain's lenders, such as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, said they are being unfairly punished for conducting normal banking business.</p><p>\"What is extraordinary is negative rates, not positive rates,\" BBVA CEO Onur Genc said as he presented the bank's second-quarter results, adding that banks would cut lending because of the measure.</p><p>He has estimated a yearly revenue hit of 250 million euros from the measure.</p><p>In Germany, Commerzbank said it would consider legal action against the Polish measure, which allows mortgage holders to suspend payments for eight months through the end of 2023. Other banks with a presence in Poland affected by the moratorium include Dutch lender ING Groep NV and France's BNP Paribas SA.</p>",
