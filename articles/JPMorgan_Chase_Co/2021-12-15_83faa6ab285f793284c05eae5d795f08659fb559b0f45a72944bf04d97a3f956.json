  "title": "JPMorgan hands $25m in stock options to top Jamie Dimon lieutenant",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase has awarded Daniel Pinto, a top lieutenant to chief executive Jamie Dimon, a “special award” of 750,000 restricted share options worth about $25m in what the US bank described as an attempt to retain him. </p> <p>JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it was making the award in the form of “stock appreciation rights” that can be exercised at a price of $159.09 per share, the average of the bank's share price on Monday. </p> <p>The appreciation rights enable Pinto, the bank's president and chief operating officer, to make a profit if JPMorgan's stock rises above that level in the coming years.</p> <p>The options, which are subject to clawback and recovery provisions, become exercisable in December 2026 and must be held until December 2031. </p> <p>JPMorgan's internal model forecasts the options will yield a profit of about $25m over the vesting schedule, according to people briefed on the matter. Argentina-born Pinto, who has spent his entire career at JPMorgan, received a pay package worth $24.5m last year. &#xa0;</p> <p>The bank said the award reflected the compensation and management development committee's desire for Pinto to remain in his role for a “further significant number of years”.</p> <p>The award is also linked to Pinto becoming the bank's sole president and chief operating officer, the bank said, following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a555e74-b5d1-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe\">departure of Gordon Smith</a> at the end of the year. Pinto also leads JPMorgan's investment banking division, which last year accounted for about 40 per cent of the bank's total revenues. </p> <p>He has been based in London in recent years but will move to New York in 2022. &#xa0;</p> <p>“It makes sense for him personally and professionally as he continues to spend a great deal of time with me and the other members of the operating committee advising on firmwide priorities and transformational projects,” Dimon wrote in a memo to staff on Tuesday about Pinto's move to New York, which was seen by the Financial Times. </p> <p>Pinto is considered the most likely candidate to take over as chief executive of JPMorgan should Dimon — one of the longest-serving CEOs on Wall Street — leave in the short term. Investors said JPMorgan veterans Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak were among the more likely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e31d7a7-4911-493b-919d-31e04d756438\">longer-term successors</a> to Dimon. </p> <p>This year, JPMorgan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/177cd5e4-d17a-4516-974a-084a7a1eab26\">granted</a> a special award of appreciation rights to Dimon projected to be worth about $49m.&#xa0;</p> <p>The bank is also preparing to pay out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c4638b-2663-4fa2-9fa3-8608d488d227\">bumper bonuses</a> to investment bankers following a record year for deal activity on Wall Street.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'JPMorgan hands $25m in stock options to top Jamie Dimon lieutenant' FT.com 15 December.
