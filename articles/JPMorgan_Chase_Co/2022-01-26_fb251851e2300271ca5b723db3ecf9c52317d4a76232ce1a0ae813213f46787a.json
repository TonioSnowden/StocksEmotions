  "text": "<p><strong>One big scoop to start: </strong>Jes Staley pressed JPMorgan Chase to keep Jeffrey Epstein as a client — despite the fact that the disgraced financier had been convicted of prostitution offences — before the bank cut him off as a customer in 2013, according to two people involved in the discussions. Get the full story from the FT's Josh Franklin <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/92d249fb-aa1f-49c1-93ab-9f46bf7b6bfd\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The Porsche deal that came with a price</h2> <p><strong>Asoka Wöhrmann </strong>had an albatross around his neck from the moment he took the top job at <strong>DWS</strong>, Germany's largest asset manager, in 2018.</p> <p>His predecessor <strong>Nicolas Moreau </strong>was dealt the axe just two years after taking the helm, unable to live up to the performance targets set by the company when it went public. </p> <p>Factor in multiple failed M&amp;A deals orchestrated by its parent <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> and an exodus of senior staff, and one could argue he was doomed from the start.</p> <p>But it turns out it would be a slip-up from Wöhrmann's previous job, as head of Deutsche's private client business in Germany, that would come back to bite.</p> <p>The DWS chief has come under scrutiny from regulators and his former employer, the FT's Olaf Storbeck <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f83cc27-f1a6-4da8-82d4-8b5d2061fbd9\">reports</a>, after Deutsche Bank alerted Germany's financial crime watchdog to a €160,000 payment made by a client to Wöhrmann during his time at the lender. </p> <p>The reason for the curious wire transfers, according to both Wöhrmann and his then-client <strong>Daniel Wruck</strong>? A sweet deal on a new<strong> Porsche</strong> Panamera.</p> <p>After the payment to Wöhrmann was made in September 2018, it emerged that the former banker had first transferred €160,000 to Wruck in September 2017.</p> <p>Here's what both men say happened: Wruck, a managing director of the chemical plant cleaner<strong> Ice Field Dry Ice Engineering</strong>, had intended to use Wöhrmann's funds to secure him the same deal on the sports car as he had for himself.</p> <p>A July 2017 email from Wruck to his dealer, in which he called Wöhrmann his “friend” who “needs to get the same killer price [as I get]!!!!!”, backs this explanation.</p> <p>When the deal didn't pan out (a lawyer for Wruck said that her client had been unable to transfer the money to the dealership on Wöhrmann's behalf “because Porsche wanted to receive the money directly from the prospective owner”) Wruck wired Wöhrmann his money back. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank still has some concerns however, sources tell the FT.</p> <p>In addition to taking the rare step of filing a suspicious activity report on a transaction involving one of its own bankers, Deutsche has recently expanded its internal investigation into the matter, according to people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>The bank also looked into Wöhrmann's use of a personal email account last summer during a joint venture negotiation over the <strong>SoftBank</strong>-backed car sales start-up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e11ea4e6-1375-45bd-9c87-db3d0375429e\"><strong>Auto1 FinTech</strong></a>, which Wruck and Wöhrmann were both involved in during the same time period as the Porsche payments.</p> <p>One big question that neither man has answered is why it took 12 months for Wruck to repay the €160,000 that was not ultimately used to buy a car.</p> <p>Wöhrmann “strenuously rejects insinuations connected to his time as head of the German private bank of Deutsche Bank”, DWS told the FT in a statement, and swore in an affidavit that he had never received any other payments from people linked to the Auto1 FinTech joint venture.</p> <p>What's clear is that Wöhrmann is best off buying his own cars for the time being. (He did, in April 2018, sign off on a used Panamera Turbo for €139,500.)</p> <h2>Could Carrefour be in the market for its next deal?</h2> <p><strong>Carrefour </strong>boss<strong> Alexandre Bompard </strong>has made real progress with a difficult turnround at the French food retailer since taking over in mid-2017. </p> <p>But investors remain wary of the intense competition the group faces in its crowded home market of France, so the shares trade at a significant discount to its European peers. </p> <p>One thing would help shift this bearish narrative: if French consolidation were to finally happen.</p> <p>Bompard himself has examined several options, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8276a5d0-bffa-11e8-95b1-d36dfef1b89a\">shortlived talks</a> with <strong>Casino</strong> in 2018, an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/284c9d2b-9a27-4341-b332-c860cec07217\">aborted takeover bid</a> from Canada's<strong> Couche-Tard</strong> last year, and most recently a potential tie-up with smaller French rival <strong>Auchan</strong>. </p> <p>The latter was rejected by Carrefour in October, but Auchan is working on ways to revive it, people close to the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3078c47e-8a30-4c33-a4bc-1f2b390b5226\">told the FT's Leila Abboud</a>. </p> <p>Bankers for the privately held, family-backed group have been sounding out private equity groups in recent weeks to enlist their financial backing to make a fresh run at Carrefour. &#xa0;</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8423515.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Making the maths work won't be easy, and the antitrust issues would be significant. But the combined group would be the biggest in France in terms of market share. </p> <p>Could consolidation be the final step in Bompard's Carrefour mission? The chief executive told the FT he didn't need to do any deals and would examine any that came up “coldly”.&#xa0;</p> <p>That leaves the door slightly ajar, so stay tuned. </p> <h2>Citadel Securities: behind the fortress&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Citadel Securities</strong> tried its best to keep a low profile. </p> <p>The market maker was on a trajectory to become the biggest company on Wall Street that no one had ever heard of, often confused for its sister company — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efd00f80-b436-4e21-8a66-edd1bb2f6ce7\"><strong>Ken Griffin</strong></a>'s wildly successful hedge fund<strong> Citadel</strong> — as it quietly ascended to power.</p> <p>That is, until a not-so-merry band of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81e9871b-5d12-480b-87a8-454b69e11958\">moon-bound</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5\">keyboard warriors</a> demanded answers from the market maker in the aftermath of <strong>Robinhood</strong>'s decision to halt stock trading during the meme-stock extravaganza one year ago this week. </p> <p>Since its founding, Citadel Securities has grown to become one of the most technologically advanced and dominant forces in market making, and its micro margins and controversial payment for order flow methods have allowed the proliferation of free trading from brokerages. </p> <p>Armed with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/188afc27-5c08-4b06-b066-d79522ed787e\">over a billion dollars</a> from venture capitalists<strong> Sequoia </strong>and <strong>Paradigm</strong>, the market maker is marching into cryptocurrency and what many speculate could be an IPO — moves that would place it even more firmly in regulators' crosshairs as it targets decentralised assets and potentially becomes publicly traded on the very same public equities markets it currently dominates.</p> <p>Read more with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4202685-9ef4-484f-a3f3-a7c731418935\">this FT deep dive</a> into Citadel Securities' emergence as “the Amazon of financial markets”.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Canadian National Railway </strong>has named <strong>Tracy Robinson</strong> as its new chief executive, thus preventing a proxy battle with activist investor <strong>TCI Fund Management</strong>.

TCI will also be awarded two seats on Canadian National's board.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone </strong>has appointed former city Treasurer of Chicago <strong>Kurt Summers Jr</strong> as head of public-private partnerships within its Infrastructure business.
