  "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond to Close 150 Stores, Cut Staff, Sell Shares to Raise Cash; Home-goods retailer to lay off about 20% of corporate and supply-chain employees and won't sell buybuy Baby chain",
  "text": "<p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. said it would close roughly 150 of its flagship stores, cut its workforce and bring in fresh cash to help turn around the struggling retail chain.</p><p>It also made preparations to sell additional shares, a move that would dilute current shareholders and that sent its stock price tumbling. Shares were down 21% at midday Wednesday.</p><p>The announcements, including laying off about 20% of its corporate and supply-chain staff, were part of a strategic update just days after the end of the company's latest quarter. The retail chain reported that comparable sales tumbled 26% in the quarter ended Aug. 27 and its operations burned through about $325 million of its cash reserves.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it had secured more than $500 million in new financing, which includes the expansion of an existing credit line. The new lifeline for the company is being led by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Sixth Street Partners. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported the company was near a new loan deal.</p><p>The retailer said that its board had determined not to sell its buybuy Baby chain, which operated 135 stores as of May. The company had hired advisers to explore a potential sale of buybuy Baby. Overall, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had about 955 total stores as of May 28.</p><p>The Union, N.J.-based retail chain on Wednesday also filed a shelf registration form, the legal paperwork to sell shares relatively quickly when it determines market conditions are favorable. The company said it could sell as many as 12 million shares of common stock and could use the proceeds to repay some of its debt.</p><p>Bed Bath shares fell about 22% to roughly $9.50 in early trading Wednesday. The stock, a favorite among meme investors, had lost nearly half its value over the past two weeks. Its market capitalization has fallen below $1 billion in recent weeks, having not traded near those levels since the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The home-goods retailer, which ousted Mark Tritton as chief executive in June amid a sales slump, said Wednesday it plans to undo much of the merchandising and inventory strategy he implemented. Mr. Tritton, a former Target Corp. executive, joined the company in 2019 and sought to turn around the retailer by pushing deeper into private-label brands, among other initiatives. Those brands, however, weren't well-received by shoppers and were hindered by pandemic-related supply-chain constraints.</p><p>The company said it would discontinue one-third of its house brands and refocus on national brands. On Wednesday, it said its chief operating officer and stores chief were leaving and that their roles have been eliminated.</p><p>The company is being led on an interim basis by board member Sue Gove, a former retail executive and retail restructuring adviser. It said that it has retained search firm Russell Reynolds to find a permanent CEO and that the search process is continuing.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said the restructuring moves announced are expected to reduce spending by about $250 million in the current fiscal year. It also reduced its full-year forecast on capital expenditures by $150 million.</p><p>The company, known for 20%-off coupons and stores stocked high with a wide selection of home goods, has struggled for years with falling sales and more recently with a dwindling cash pile. It ended May with roughly $100 million in cash reserves.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your outlook on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The retailer received another blow when billionaire activist Ryan Cohen sold off his 10% stake in the company, about six months after acquiring his shares. The company's stock, which had been rallying in previous weeks, slid after individuals followed Mr. Cohen's selloff.</p><p>The company plans to release its full financial results for the second quarter on Sept. 29.</p><p>Last week, S&amp;P Global Ratings cut the company's credit rating deeper into junk territory and assigned a negative outlook, indicating that it could downgrade the rating again in the near future.</p><p>Write to Inti Pacheco at inti.pacheco@wsj.com</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to Close 150 Stores, Cut Staff, Sell Shares to Raise Cash</p>",
