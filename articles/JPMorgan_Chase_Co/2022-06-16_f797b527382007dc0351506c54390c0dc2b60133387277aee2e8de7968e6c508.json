  "title": "U.S. News: Biden Presses Oil Companies on Prices --- With refining capacity near 100%, president lacks an easy fix to curb a key driver of inflation",
  "text": "<p>The president called on the companies to take immediate action to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. He said his administration was prepared to use its emergency authorities to increase capacity in the near term, if necessary.</p><p>Some of the oil companies to which Mr. Biden sent the letter said they are expanding their refining capacity. Exxon Mobil Corp. said the U.S. government could boost supplies by issuing Jones Act waivers allowing shippers to move supplies around domestically on much bigger vessels, and waive some fuel specifications.</p><p>Mr. Biden's short-term options for lowering gasoline prices are limited, according to analysts, and the steps he has taken have done little to slow surging prices. Without an easy fix, the president has increasingly blamed oil companies and sought to convince the public that prices at the pump are out of his control, pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine as the main driver.</p><p>Mr. Biden's letter was sent to Exxon, Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Phillips 66, Chevron Corp., BP and Shell. Mr. Biden requested that the companies provide his administration with an explanation of any reductions in capacity since 2020 as well as ideas for addressing high prices.</p><p>Exxon pointed to an expansion project to boost capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery by 250,000 barrels a day, to run light sweet crude pumped from U.S. shale plays, as evidence that it was doing its part to raise domestic output. Exxon added that the U.S. government could also enable more investment in oil by having more predictable lease sales and streamlining approvals for pipelines.</p><p>Shell said it is producing as much as it can from its relatively small U.S. refinery footprint and is exploring other options, including accelerating efforts to lift oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and repurposing an idled refinery in Louisiana to make lower-carbon fuel.</p><p>Valero said it is expanding its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.</p><p>U.S. refineries closed about 1 million barrels a day of capacity during the pandemic, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Fuel makers have been running full tilt in recent weeks, though last week the amount of operable capacity refineries were using slipped about half a percentage point from the prior week to 93.7%, a drop most pronounced on the West Coast. Refiners in the East Coast were running at 98.3% capacity; in the Gulf Coast, 96.5%, according to data released Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Meanwhile, inventories of crude oil and petroleum products were the lowest since 2008. Gasoline stocks were down 25% from this time last year; diesel stocks were down almost 27%.</p><p>The U.S. has released oil from the country's strategic stockpiles in coordination with other nations and allowed high-ethanol content gasoline to be sold in the summer months.</p><p>White House officials said Mr. Biden is considering additional measures, including calling for a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax.</p><p>Calling on the companies to boost capacity, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday: \"We see it as a patriotic duty.\" Asked what measures the Biden administration might take if the companies don't take sufficient action, she said Mr. Biden would weigh using the Defense Production Act, but declined to offer additional details.</p><p>A person familiar with the administration's thinking said the White House doesn't yet have a concrete set of policy proposals for additional executive action to increase refining capacity. The person said the administration is open to receiving ideas on possible executive action from the companies.</p><p>The Biden administration can do little to quickly alleviate consumers' pain at the pump, or increase refineries' capacity and fuel supplies, analysts say. Refineries are making money now but have operated on far thinner margins in recent years, particularly in the early days of the pandemic, when economic lockdowns led to a historic crash in demand.</p><p>Before the pandemic, fuel demand was plateauing in developed economies, and sales of electric vehicles were rising. Meanwhile, fuel-efficiency standards have led vehicles to use less gasoline.</p><p>In recent years, some oil companies have sold off refineries and shut others down amid anemic margins. Last year, Shell sold refinery stakes in Washington state, Alabama and Texas, but couldn't find a buyer for a facility in Louisiana, and later said it would close it and repurpose it.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
