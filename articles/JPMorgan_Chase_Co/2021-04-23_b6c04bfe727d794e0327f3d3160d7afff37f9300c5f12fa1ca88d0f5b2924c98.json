  "text": "<p>BlackRock and Norway's $1.3tn oil fund have backed a capital raise from Piraeus Bank, betting Greece's largest retail lender can tackle its bad loans even as the pandemic hits the country's economy.</p> <p>The former problem child of European banking on Friday raised almost €1.4bn in a fundraising that significantly reduces the Greek government's stake, from 61 per cent to 27 per cent.</p> <p>Pireaus has sought to reassure investors that this recapitalisation will be its last, after resorting to several over the past decade in order to navigate the country's financial and economic crises.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the capital raised, Piraeus aims to reduce its non-performing loans from 45 per cent last year to less than 10 per cent in the next 12 months and&#xa0;eventually&#xa0;to 3 per cent&#xa0;by the end of 2024. </p> <p>“Piraeus is embarking on one of the largest bad debt clean-ups we have seen among European banks<em>” </em>said Mehmet Sevim, a banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “This is clearly ambitious, yet we have seen from recent transactions by peers that there are good levels of investor interest for Greek securitisations, and we think that, if executed well, the plan will undoubtedly open a new page for Piraeus.”</p> <p>As part of its “Sunrise” plan first announced last month, Piraeus has laid out steps designed to repair its balance sheet by taking on better loans.</p> <p>The capital raising, which saw Piraeus sell shares for €1.15 a piece, also attracted US asset manager Fidelity. Hedge fund manager John Paulson used the fundraising to increase his stake from 4.6 per cent to almost 19 per cent, making him the second-largest shareholder after the Greek government.</p> <p>“Quality institutional names, some of which had not invested in the country in a long time, is a pivot point for the deepening, broadening, and strengthening of Greece's capital markets,” said Alexis Patelis, the chief economic adviser to Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.</p> <p>The bank's investors, however, are wagering that Piraeus can cope the economic damage inflicted by the pandemic that prompted 10 per cent contraction in the economy last year. Coronavirus struck just as Greece was emerging from a decade-long debt crisis.</p> <p>While EU governments are concerned that a resurgence of the pandemic and further restrictive measures could lead to a wave of corporate defaults, rising non-performing loans, and job losses, the Bank of Greece estimates that&#xa0;the new NPLs resulting from the pandemic&#xa0;will be&#xa0;at about&#xa0;€8-10bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Greek's banking sector has the highest rates of non-performing loans, far above the EU average, despite their reduction&#xa0;by about €50bn from a 2016 peak.&#xa0;</p> <p>Christos Megalou, the chief executive of Piraeus, said in a statement that “the capital raise will enable the bank to achieve its balance sheet clean-up and to support the Greek economy as it recovers from the pandemic.”</p><p>Source: Eleni Varvitsioti in Athens 2021 'Piraeus wins backing of major investors for €1.4bn capital raise' FT.com 23 April.
