  "text": "<p>Dear reader,</p> <p>Greetings from New York, where the weather is a bone-chilling minus 8 degrees Celsius (even lower with any wind-chill factor). After an unusually mild start to the winter season, an Arctic freeze arrived with a whipcrack this week via Canada. </p> <p>This icy blast is not the only invader from north of the border. Canadian banks — flush with excess capital and record share prices — have also swept in, seeking to extend their presence in the US.</p> <p>Bank of Montreal (BMO) made headlines last month when it struck a deal to buy the US unit of BNP Paribas for $16.3bn. The deal, one of the biggest ever by a Canadian lender, is a bold bet. BMO already has a sizeable presence in the midwest following the acquisitions of Harris Bankcorp in the 1980s and the takeover of Marshall &amp; Ilsley a decade ago.</p> <p>But the purchase of San Francisco-based Bank of the West will double its US retail presence and give it a strong position in California, which has been resilient economically during the pandemic.</p> <p>The current push comes at a time of relative strength. Once dubbed the world's best boring banks, Canada's biggest lenders are more profitable than ever, thanks to years of low interest rates, robust consumer borrowing and a red-hot housing market fuelling demand for mortgages.</p> <p>The “Big Six” — Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), BMO, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada — collectively pulled in C$57.7bn (US$46bn) in net profits in the fiscal year that ended in October. Return on equity at the banks ranged between 14.4 per cent and nearly 21 per cent, above the range for America's largest institutions.</p> <p>It shouldn't surprise that the Canadians have gone shopping down south. High capital levels amassed during a near two-year moratorium on capital redistributions — only lifted in November — and stock prices trading at record highs hinted that Canadian banks would seek acquisitions. </p> <p>The US has an enticing market. Unlike Canada, where the Big Six already control nearly 90 per cent of the market, the US has a more fragmented industry and offers more opportunities to grow.</p> <p>And compared with European banks, Canadian lenders have proved better at making money in the American market. That explains why BBVA of Spain, NatWest and even HSBC have retreated from the US. They have struggled to compete against big Main Street lenders such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. </p> <p>At BMO, the US unit's return on equity was 15.8 per cent in fiscal 2021 and has done a good job of controlling overheads. Its adjusted efficiency ratio, which measures expenses as a percentage of revenues, clocked in at 50.8 per cent. Bank of the West does less well at 63 per cent, suggesting that BMO will target that higher cost base to generate a target of $860m in pre-tax cost synergies from technology and back-office savings.</p> <p>Aside from BMO, TD Bank also has a big presence in the US. Canada's second-largest lender by market value has become the eighth largest in the US by assets. After reportedly losing out on Bank of West to BMO, it remains keen with a strong balance sheet to back its appetite.</p> <p>Meanwhile RBC, Canada's largest bank, is interested in buying wealth distribution and commercial banking businesses in the US.</p> <p>One drawback for shareholders on any major deals would be on share buyback or dividend increase plans. These will probably have to pause. BMO has already said it would delay its share repurchase programme, which it had previously promised to restart, until the Bank of the West deal closes.</p> <p>But investors should be patient. So far, Canadian banks have punched above their weights in the US. Greater scale efficiencies that come from consolidation will help them keep their places.</p> <p>Have a great rest of the week.</p> <p><strong>Pan Kwan Yuk</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: Pan Kwan Yuk 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: make way for the Canadians' FT.com 12 January.
