  "title": "U.S. News: Gas Prices Climb to Average Of $4.59",
  "text": "<p>Prices vary across U.S. states, with an average price in California hitting $6.06 a gallon for regular gas Thursday, compared with $4.03 a gallon in Oklahoma. Regular gasoline is currently more than $4 a gallon on average in each U.S. state for the first time since AAA started tracking data, said Devin Gladden, an AAA spokesman. The average price in Hawaii, Nevada, Washington, Alaska and Oregon rose above $5 a gallon Thursday.</p><p>Prices are expected to remain high throughout the summer. Mr. Gladden of AAA said prices typically decline by the end of summer, but what happens this year remains unclear.</p><p>A report from JPMorgan this week said retail prices for gas could jump to $6.20 a gallon by August, fueled by increasing demand during the summer driving season.</p><p>A combination of factors have caused gas prices to soar. The cost of crude oil rose as consumer demand started to return to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels over the past year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year jolted the global market, prompting an increase in oil prices.</p><p>The House on Thursday passed legislation 217-207, largely along party lines, that would give the Federal Trade Commission more authority to prosecute alleged price gouging if the president declares a national emergency. The bill is largely seen as messaging from Democrats ahead of midterm elections, and it is unlikely to pass the Senate.</p><p>While the numbers have the highest price tag seen in the U.S., they don't factor in inflation. In 2008 during the financial crisis, gas prices rose to around $4.10 a gallon on average -- or about $5.39 a gallon when adjusted for inflation, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
