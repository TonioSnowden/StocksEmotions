  "text": "<p>In an interview, Mr. Ting declined to say what form such a listing could take.</p><p>\"We're going to look at all available options,\" said Mr. Ting, adding that its ridership has bounced back after the pandemic hammered its business, which has played a role in its goal to list shares next year.</p><p>A public listing for Lime, which is incorporated as Neutron Holdings Inc., would serve as another early test of Wall Street's appetite for so-called micro-mobility companies that offer alternative transportation options but have struggled to become profitable.</p><p>Bird Global Inc., which offers its own electric-scooter and electric-bike rental service, combined with a special-purpose acquisition company this year and began trading this week on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>The funding, which Lime said closed Friday, came in the form of $418 million of convertible debt led by the Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, an investment management company for the city of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management LLC, among other participating investors. Lime also raised a $105 million senior secured term loan facility from the private credit group at UBS O'Connor.</p><p>The convertible debt, which would become equity for investors if the company has a public listing, is sometimes used by companies nearing a public listing.</p><p>With the financing, San Francisco-based Lime has raised roughly $1.4 billion in venture capital and debt since it was founded in 2017, tapping prominent venture firms including Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>Lime's fundraising comes as the company has largely regained its footing after the coronavirus pandemic all but froze its critical commuter and tourism-rider segments in 2020.</p><p>The company's 2021 third-quarter revenue was close to pre-pandemic 2019 revenue, Mr. Ting said in an interview for The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference in October.</p><p>Even with the resurgence in ridership, Lime has yet to reach sustained profitability when not stripping out some capital costs. Mr. Ting said that Lime was profitable in the third quarter on an adjusted Ebitda basis. The acronym stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and leaves out various capital costs such as scooter depreciation, which has been one impediment for Lime's and other scooter companies' efforts to become profitable.</p><p>The financing will help Lime deploy more of its latest models of scooter and bikes, which are more durable than previous models, Mr. Ting said.</p><p>The longevity of its hardware has been a key factor in its bid to achieve profitability. Lime and other scooter-rental startups largely earn revenue on a per-ride basis and increasing the longevity of their vehicles allows them to maximize the unit economics of each scooter.</p><p>To list shares publicly, venture and debt-financed startups typically hold an initial public offering or, as has boomed in popularity recently, agree to merge with a special-purpose acquisition vehicle.</p><p>This year, Lime launched its services in more than 80 cities, increasing the number of cities in which it operates to more than 200.</p>",
