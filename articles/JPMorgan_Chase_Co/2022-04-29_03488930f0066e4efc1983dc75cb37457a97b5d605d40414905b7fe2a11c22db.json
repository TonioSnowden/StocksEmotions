  "title": "Russia Pays Bondholders Despite Western Sanctions: What to Know; The country has until May 4 to remit funds to foreign bondholders' accounts before defaulting",
  "text": "<p>Here's what to know about the potential default.</p><p>Why might Russia default?</p><p>Russia made debt payments on Friday totaling $649.2 million that it was supposed to send to creditors on April 4 for two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds, but which might not make it to bondholders' accounts in time for the country to avoid default.</p><p>New sanctions are mostly to blame for the holdup. The U.S. announced on April 4 that it was blocking Russia from using U.S. banks to channel payments on its foreign-currency bonds, hoping to deprive Moscow of access to offshore deposits and deplete its war chest at home. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow had used foreign bank accounts to stay current on its debts.</p><p>Russia's Finance Ministry said it attempted to make the payments in dollars on April 4, but JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the Kremlin's intermediary bank for the bond in question, declined to process the $649.2 million in payments because the U.S. Treasury didn't grant approval. On Friday, it said however that it had made the payments and that the money was with the agent bank for the two bonds, Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Citigroup will ensure that processing the payments onward to Euroclear, the clearinghouse responsible for sending the payment on to bondholders, is in compliance with both U.S. and U.K. sanctions, according to a person familiar with Citi's thinking.</p><p>Russia has a grace period of 30 days from April 4 to remit funds to investors' accounts before defaulting on the debt.</p><p>How did Russia make the payments if it's sanctioned?</p><p>Russia made the payments on Friday from bank accounts that were not subject to direct sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter. The payments came through Dom.rf, a Russia-based housing bank not under U.S. sanctions, which then sent the money to correspondent bank BNY Mellon, according to one of the people. BNY Mellon then sent the money on to Citigroup, the payment agent for the two bonds, the person said.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department has decided to allow investors and banks to receive and process payments tied to Russian sovereign bonds until May 25. In early April, the Biden administration blocked Russia from using U.S. banks. By doing so, the White House revoked an earlier exemption that had allowed Moscow to use American bank accounts.</p><p>Is there still a risk of default?</p><p>Russia still isn't out of the woods. The money must land in bondholders' accounts by May 4 for the country to avoid defaulting on the debt. The U.S. could still potentially trip up Russia by seeking to block the money from flowing into the hands of bondholders by the end of the grace period, or Citigroup could decline to pass on the funds on behalf of the Kremlin.</p><p>If a quarter of the country's creditors agree, they can declare Russia in default and try to force it to pay. Russian sovereign bonds have cross-default provisions, meaning that once the country is deemed in default on one bond issue, it can be deemed in default on all its outstanding sovereign obligations. Court challenges to get Russia to pay would likely take place in the U.K., where many of the bonds were issued.</p><p>How much debt does Russia have?</p><p>Russia has been fairly restrained in raising money in recent years, partly out of prudence and partly because of previous rounds of sanctions. The country hasn't issued dollar-denominated bonds since 2019, when U.S. investors and banks were barred by sanctions from participating. Its overall outstanding foreign-currency debt is just under $60 billion.</p><p>Overall, the Russian economy came into the war with a manageable level of external debt, roughly 25% of the size of its economy. But that was when Russia had access to its foreign-currency reserves.</p><p>Russia also has a robust local government-bond market. Foreigners owned around 20% of those local government bonds as Russia's invasion of Ukraine began. Since then, Russia's government has made payments on those debts to local bondholders but it has blocked cross-border money transfers to foreign creditors holding local government debt.</p><p>Normally that would constitute a default, but in Russia, borrowers in the local debt market no longer have to ensure payments reach investors to avoid defaulting. The borrowers' obligations are met if the money arrives at the clearing system, and it's not their fault if creditors never get the money.</p><p>Who owns Russian bonds?</p><p>Foreign investors who run emerging-markets portfolios held Russian debt before the war, but Russia was just a slice of the global universe of bonds. Russian sovereign debt made up around 6% of a JPMorgan local-currency emerging-market bond index and 2.7% of one for dollar bonds. JPMorgan said in March that it would exclude Russian sovereign and corporate debt from all of its widely tracked fixed-income indexes. Many investors have already written down the value of the bonds.</p><p>What is the likelihood of a default?</p><p>Moscow remains steadfast that it wants to avoid the unpleasant distinction of failing to pay its debts. Credit-rating firms, economists and the International Monetary Fund have all warned that a default is probable.</p><p>What will the impact be on Russia if it defaults?</p><p>An official default on its debt would have a limited immediate impact on Russia's economy as the country is already cut off from international markets by the sanctions. That said, after Russia defaulted in 1998, it was back at investment grade by 2003. Argentina has defaulted multiple times and yet after a change in government, was able to access markets again. Investors tend to have short memories.</p><p>Will foreign investors ever get their money back?</p><p>Some investors have sold off their holdings to opportunistic investors who hope, someday, to broker a deal with the Kremlin to recoup what they are owed. Present sanctions, however, forbid most forms of engagement with the Russian Federation, so discussing the terms of a debt restructuring is, legally speaking, a long way off.</p><p>What happened when Russia defaulted in the past?</p><p>Russia's last default on its foreign debt was in February 1918, when the newly installed Bolshevik Party repudiated the Russian Empire's borrowings.</p><p>In August 1998, Russia defaulted on domestic bonds during an economic crisis made worse by oil prices as low as $10 a barrel. Foreign creditors to the Russian Federation ultimately came out unscathed, and their debts weren't restructured. Ruble-denominated debt, more than 75% of which was held in the country, took a haircut, as well as some legacy debt incurred by the Soviet Union.</p><p>The 1998 default also triggered major volatility in U.S. markets, which led to the unraveling of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management and required a Fed-organized bailout by major Wall Street banks.</p><p>Investors have taken out a type of insurance against default. When do they get paid for that?</p><p>Credit-default swaps are contracts used by investors as a type of insurance in case a borrower fails to pay. Soon after Russia is deemed to be in default, an industry body that oversees the credit-default-swaps market would meet to determine whether proper terms of a default had occurred. If it deems that to be the case, the body would schedule an auction process, which would allow investors to settle their insurance claims and trade in the underlying bonds. Restrictions on trading in Russian sovereign debt might complicate the auction process.</p><p>Caitlin McCabe contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p>",
