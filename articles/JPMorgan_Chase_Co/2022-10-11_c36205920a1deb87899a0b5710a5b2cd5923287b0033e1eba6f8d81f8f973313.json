  "title": "Stocks Edge Higher, Pausing Selloff; Inflation data due Thursday will show whether the Fed's rate increases are taming consumer prices",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9% higher. The blue-chip index was aided by big gains in Amgen Inc. The biotech stock jumped 6%, making it the best performer in the Dow on Tuesday.</p><p>Investors have been grappling throughout the year with the effects of decades-high inflation and the Federal Reserve's attempts to tame it with higher interest rates. For many, the concerns have grown deeper in recent weeks as inflation remains stubbornly high and traders worry that the Fed will cool the economy so much that it tips into a recession.</p><p>\"The question now is not if there will be a recession, it's when and how bad,\" said Justin Wiggs, managing director in equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus. One week ago, traders were cheering the biggest two-day rally in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 in two years. That enthusiasm has since waned. \"We've pivoted, and the path of least resistance is now lower,\" Mr. Wiggs said.</p><p>Investors say sentiment is especially fragile this week in what is shaping up to be a fateful few days for the economy and markets. U.S. inflation data due Thursday will show whether the Fed's sizable interest-rate rises are working to tame soaring consumer prices. A larger-than-forecast rise could bolster expectations that Fed officials will opt for another supersize 0.75 percentage point increase at their next meeting.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are bracing for the first wave of major corporate earnings reports due this week, which are expected to show companies struggling with high rates and weakening consumer demand. PepsiCo reports Wednesday while financial titans such as BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley report later in the week.</p><p>\"First-quarter and second-quarter earnings came in remarkably well. The third quarter may be the pivot point at which we see earnings cannot keep growing to the sky, and that companies are subject to the economic headwinds we are facing from all kinds of directions,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth US.</p><p>And what's even more important than third-quarter results, some investors say, is the guidance corporate leaders give about next year.</p><p>Volatility in the U.K. government-bond market resumed after the Bank of England stepped up its efforts to support pension funds battered by a bond-market rout. The bank said it would add inflation-linked government bonds to its bond-buying program. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds known as gilts declined to 4.431% from 4.497% on Monday.</p><p>The bank warned that dysfunction in the U.K. bond market posed a \"material risk to U.K. financial stability.\" The warning comes just a day after the BOE said it would increase the amount of long-dated bonds it was willing to buy.</p><p>Yields on benchmark U.S. government bonds continued their ascent, coming within sight of the 4% level. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.905% from 3.883% on Friday. The U.S. bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.</p><p>In commodity markets, oil weakened as concerns about the economy returned to the fore. Prices rose last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies agreed to slash their output. On Tuesday, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, shed 1.9% to $94.34 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas indexes slumped. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell 2.6%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 2.2% lower, hitting its lowest level in more than a decade.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.6%, led by losses among its oil-and-gas and chemicals companies.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Higher, Pausing Selloff</p>",
