  "text": "<p>A whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/960243ec-6a65-4879-bfe1-9afcb2c0c7b3\">last night accused Facebook</a> of placing “profit over safety”, as it emerged that she had complained to US securities regulators that the social media company was misleading investors.</p> <p>Speaking on the news programme <em>60 Minutes</em>, Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, unmasked herself as the whistleblower who leaked a trove of internal company documents to the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Haugen suggested that Facebook had lied to the public, exaggerating the progress it had made in tackling hate, violence and misinformation on its platform, presenting “tens of thousands” of pages of documents as evidence.</p> <p>“There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” Haugen said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lx5VmAdZSI\">the interview</a>. “And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money.”</p> <p>The revelations have plunged Facebook into its deepest crisis since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. But the company defended its policies after the broadcast.</p> <p>“We stand by our public statements and are ready to answer any questions regulators may have about our work,” said Lena Pietsch, Facebook's director of policy communications.</p> <p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Haugen, 37, worked as a product manager at Facebook since 2019 on the civic integrity team. She left the company in May of this year. </p> <p>Her career has also included stints as a product manager for Pinterest, Yelp and Google, and she was part of the founding team of the first iteration of dating app Hinge, then called Secret Agent Cupid. She is due to testify at a Senate hearing tomorrow.</p> <p><em>Do you agree with </em>Frances Haugen? <em>Email me your thoughts to gordon.smith@ft.com.
