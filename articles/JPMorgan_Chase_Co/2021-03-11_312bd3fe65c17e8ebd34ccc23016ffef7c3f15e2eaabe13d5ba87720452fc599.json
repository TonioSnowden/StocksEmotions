Citigroup Inc., in announcing its own $1 billion initiative last fall, said that if gaps for Black people in wages, education and housing were closed 20 years ago, $16 trillion could have been added to the U.S. gross domestic product.</p><p>Goldman said reducing the earnings gap for Black women could create as many as 1.7 million new jobs and increase annual GDP by up to $450 billion.</p>",
