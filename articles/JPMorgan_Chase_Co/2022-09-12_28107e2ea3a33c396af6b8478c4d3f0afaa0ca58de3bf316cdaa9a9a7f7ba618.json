  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is planning to implement a round of job cuts in the coming weeks that threatens to result in hundreds of dismissals among the bank's employees, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p> <p>In a sign of the dealmaking slowdown on Wall Street, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a> will restart its annual cull of underperforming bankers, which it paused during the coronavirus pandemic as banks struggled to keep up with the workload. </p> <p>The process typically results in between 1 and 5 per cent of company-wide employees losing their jobs, with the impending review set to result in dismissals towards the lower end of that range, the person said. </p> <p>At the end of June, Goldman had about 47,000 employees across investment banking, trading, asset and wealth management, consumer banking and operational functions. </p> <p>A Goldman spokesperson declined to comment. The planned job cuts were first reported by the New York Times on Monday. </p> <p>Goldman finance chief Denis Coleman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c0c341f-6a02-4996-9b6c-e927e69273ea\">telegraphed the dismissals</a> in July when he said the bank was looking at ways to slash costs, including reintroducing the year-end performance review of its employees.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5a39f59-615a-405e-8ddb-805b729953d4\">Financial Times previously reported</a> that Goldman had paused hiring some replacements for departing bankers.</p> <p>The planned dismissals are indicative of broader concerns in finance of job cuts amid a drop-off in dealmaking activity and a slowdown in economic growth in the US and Europe. </p> <p>It reflects the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4dda7ee-a5b9-4d33-b27c-06067a4a5f34\">feast-or-famine nature</a> of the banking industry, with the cull set to follow a blockbuster year of profits in 2021 for the sector.</p> <p>In investment banking, Goldman's revenues in the first six months of 2022 were down 38 per cent year on year, a smaller drop than at peers JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Revenues have fallen 83 per cent in asset management, while the bank is conducting a review of its lossmaking consumer division. &#xa0;</p> <p>The drop-off has been particularly acute on equity capital markets desks as stock market listings have dried up.</p> <p>One bright spot has been Goldman's trading division, where revenues are up 15 per cent year on year and accounted for almost three-quarters of Goldman's total net revenues in the first six months of 2022. </p> <p>Compensation and benefits are the biggest expenses for banks such as Goldman. For its revenue-generating employees, the bulk of pay typically comes in the form of year-end bonuses, giving the bank flexibility to lower costs in a fallow year. </p> <p>However, adjustments in variable pay are often accompanied by cutting employees who are ranked poorly by managers.</p> <p>At Goldman, compensation and benefits were down 31 per cent year on year in the first six months of 2022, a steeper drop than the 25 per cent fall in net revenues. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman said in July that the bank's “ultimate weapon” to manage a slowdown is pay.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs plans job cuts as dealmaking dries up' FT.com 12 September.
