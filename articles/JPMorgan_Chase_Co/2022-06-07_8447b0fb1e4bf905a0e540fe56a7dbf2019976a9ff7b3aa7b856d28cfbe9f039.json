  "title": "Treasury Moves to Block U.S. Investors From Buying Russian Debt; New sanctions guidance says U.S. investors aren't allowed to buy Russian corporate or sovereign debt and can only divest themselves of it to foreign buyers",
  "text": "<p>\"Consistent with our goal to deny Russia the financial resources it needs to continue its brutal war against Ukraine, Treasury has made clear that U.S. persons are prohibited from making new investments in the success of Russia, including through purchases on the secondary market,\" a Treasury spokesperson said.</p><p>Secondary purchases of Russian corporate debt in the U.S. and Europe have already been limited because of sanctions against financial institutions like Sberbank and VTB Bank and the perceived reputational cost of backing entities based in the country. Still, some opportunistic buyers have bought Russian companies' debt at a discount, betting that the bonds will recover if the war between Russia and Ukraine comes to an end.</p><p>The U.S. has been moving to restrict Russia's access to foreign credit markets since the war in Ukraine began. The Treasury last month moved to push Russia into default on its sovereign bonds, effectively cutting off its ability to make payments on its dollar-denominated debt through U.S. financial institutions.</p><p>The new guidance from Treasury appears to be a broader interpretation of existing sanctions that were levied against Russia back in April, seeking to curtail new capital inflows into Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The expansion of sanctions is likely to force U.S. investors to sell Russia-linked debts or write them off as having little to no value.</p><p>\"Treasury's past statements made it clear that they were trying to prevent fresh funds from coming into Russia,\" said Dennis Hranitzky, head of the sovereign litigation practice at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan. \"This does something very different.\"</p><p>Prices of dollar-denominated Russian government bonds traded between 15 and 25 cents on the dollar Tuesday, investors said, about 5 cents lower than Monday. Russian state gas giant Gazprom's bonds also fell by about 5 cents from their value Monday to trade between 25 and 30 cents on the dollar Tuesday.</p><p>It isn't the first time that the U.S. has barred American investors from buying a country's debt from other trading houses. The Treasury previously banned purchases of Venezuela's government debt on secondary markets. The new guidance on Russia is broader, encompassing corporate debt issued for business projects or operations located in Russia.</p><p>While foreign investors running emerging-markets portfolios held Russian debt before the war, Russia was just a slice of the global universe of bonds. Russian sovereign debt made up around 6% of a JPMorgan local-currency emerging-markets bond index and 2.7% of one for dollar bonds. Investors tend to use such indexes as a barometer of how much to hold of a certain asset. In March, JPMorgan removed Russian sovereign and corporate debt from all of its widely tracked fixed-income indexes.</p><p>Investors can still buy shares in diversified funds that hold Russia-linked debt, according to the Treasury.</p><p>Many Russian companies tapped international debt markets through debt-issuing entities and special-purpose vehicles domiciled in countries like Ireland, Luxembourg or the Netherlands. The trading ban now covers debt securities issued by entities with substantial ownership or operations in Russia, leaving lawyers and investors without clear answers on how trading in many of those foreign issuers' debts could be affected.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com, Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p>",
