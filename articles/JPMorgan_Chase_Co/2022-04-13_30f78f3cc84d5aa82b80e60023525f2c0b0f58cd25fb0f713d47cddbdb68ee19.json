  "title": "U.S. News: White House Eyes Pick for Bank Regulator --- Michael Barr, who as a Treasury official helped craft Dodd-Frank Act, is leading candidate",
  "text": "<p>Biden administration officials have begun reaching out to Capitol Hill to gauge support for Mr. Barr, some of the people said. If he is nominated, Mr. Barr is expected to win the backing of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which would oversee the nomination, one of the people said.</p><p>The White House declined to comment. Mr. Barr, currently the dean of the University of Michigan's public policy school, didn't respond to a request for comment. Politico earlier reported that Mr. Barr was the leading candidate for the job.</p><p>The Biden administration has struggled to advance its nominees for key financial regulatory posts through the 50-50 Senate.</p><p>Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden's first nominee to be the Federal Reserve's vice chairwoman of banking supervision, withdrew from consideration for the job last month. She took herself out of the running after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote in the evenly divided chamber, said he couldn't support Ms. Raskin's nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.</p><p>The banking supervision position plays a key role in overseeing the largest U.S. financial firms including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Mr. Barr last year was a contender to be the Comptroller of the Currency, another top banking post, before skepticism from progressives stymied that bid. The eventual White House choice for that role, Saule Omarova, withdrew in the face of opposition from moderate Democrats.</p><p>Some progressives have raised concerns about Mr. Barr's previous work for financial-technology firms Ripple Labs Inc. and LendingClub Corp., arguing that his ties could conflict with his role as a regulator. More broadly, some critics believe the Obama administration's response to the financial crisis did too little to help homeowners.</p><p>\"Placing him at the top of the Fed's regulatory efforts would also send a cynical message to anyone who hoped Democrats had realized that preserving 'too big to fail' after 2008 was a mistake,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive group.</p><p>But people close to the White House believe Mr. Barr can win over liberal lawmakers in the Senate. Mr. Barr has in the past received praise from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) for his work to help set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p>A person familiar with the deliberations said Mr. Barr's advocacy for building upon Dodd-Frank has pushed him to the front of the pack.</p><p>After previous White House picks for top financial posts didn't go through, the Biden administration will also need the support of key centrists like Mr. Manchin in the Senate.</p><p>Without a confirmed Fed bank supervisor, the Fed board has lacked an internal voice advocating for the financial rules favored by the Biden administration. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last month that a key Fed committee is dormant without someone in the post, adding that bank mergers and annual big-bank stress tests now fall to the full Fed board.</p><p>Regulatory rules from the Trump administration also have remained in force, and top administration priorities on housing and climate change haven't advanced.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
