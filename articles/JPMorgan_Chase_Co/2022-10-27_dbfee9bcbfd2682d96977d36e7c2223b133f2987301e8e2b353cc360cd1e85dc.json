  "title": "Gilead stock rises on more upbeat forecasts, while COVID drug sales slide; Sales of Gilead's remdesivir fall 52%, 'driven by lower rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations,' executives say",
  "text": "<p>Sales were $7.04 billion, compared with $7.42 billion in the same period last year.</p><p>Adjusted for acquisition-related charges, losses on equities and tax charges, Gilead earned $1.90 per share, compared with $2.65 a year ago.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet expected Gilead to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.43, on revenue of $6.13 billion.</p><p>\"In HIV, treatment and prevention markets continue to grow with further share gains for Biktarvy in treatment, and we received our first approval for our long-acting HIV agent, lenacapavir, in Europe,\" Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said in a statement. \"In oncology, there is increasing demand for cell therapies and Trodelvy.\"</p><p>HIV product sales rose 7% to $4.5 billion during the quarter, boosted by \"government utilization leading to higher average realized price, as well as higher demand.\"</p><p>Sales in its COVID-19 medication, Veklury, also known as remdesivir, fell 52% to $925 million during the quarter, \"primarily driven by lower rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations compared to the third quarter of 2021.\"</p><p>Executives for the company also raised their sales and profit outlook for the full year. Management said it expects total product sales of between $25.9 billion and $26.2 billion, up from a prior range of $24.5 billion to $25 billion. They forecast adjusted earnings per share of between $6.95 and $7.15, better than earlier expectations for a range of $6.35 to $6.75.</p><p>For the full year, FactSet forecasts earnings per share of $6.51, on sales of $25.28 billion.</p><p>Shares rose 1.9% after hours on Wednesday.</p><p>Gilead over the past year has weathered patent disputes over some of its HIV drugs and a big legal settlement. Sales in its HIV business, its largest by sales, slipped last year, as protection from generics competition fell away for drugs like Truvada and Atripla in the U.S.</p><p>So far this year, a combination of higher prices and demand for HIV and breast-cancer drugs have increased sales. Gilead's stock also got a lift this month when J.P. Morgan analysts Christopher Schott upgraded the stock.</p><p>Schott cited strength in Gilead's HIV drugs, particularly Biktarvy, which executives have estimated holds more than 40% of the HIV treatment market. And he cited potential in Gilead's cancer treatments, which have faced questions about growth.</p><p>\"At current levels, we see GILD's HIV business alone supporting the stock's entire market cap,\" he said. \"And with an oncology franchise that we forecast to reach ~$5bn in sales by 2030 as well as potential upside to lenacapravir estimates over time, we see shares as clearly undervalued at current levels.\"</p><p>The company last month alsoagreed to resolve patent challenges with five generic-drug manufacturers related to some of its HIV and hepatitis drugs. An RBC analyst said the settlement would extend the exclusivity of those drugs to 2031 and 2032.</p><p>Schott said the settlement could offer \"visibility\" on Gilead's HIV segment. He also saw the company moving to smaller acquisitions, following a mixed track record in the past.</p><p>Gilead this month also said the FDA gave priority review for its application for wider use of Trodelvy, a breast-cancer drug. Last month, Gilead said the World Health Organization expanded its guidance to recommend remdesivir for treatment of patients with severe symptoms. Shares also moved higher in August after the company said Trodelvy \"significantly improves\" survival in some forms of breast cancer.</p><p>Gilead stock is down 3% so far this year. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 Index SPX is down 20% year to date.</p><p>Gilead stock rises on more upbeat forecasts, while COVID drug sales slide</p>",
