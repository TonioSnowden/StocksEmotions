  "title": "Where to Find Florida's Best Beaches? Try These Five Islands; Beyond the Florida Keys, there are many other small islands strung along the Sunshine State's vast coastline. Here, five of the most seductive.",
  "text": "<p>Still, there are more than enough patches of sand to accommodate the influx of visitors, especially if you skip over the busy Florida Keys in favor of the Sunshine State's lesser-known islands. Here, we focus on five distinctive isles, each home to beautiful beaches as well as other indisputable charms. For Shell Collectors: Sanibel Island</p><p>A 40-minute drive from Fort Myers, Sanibel is a lush, laid-back place with pretty, shell-strewn beaches and gentle surf that's often punctuated by leaping dolphins. Visitors come for a window of welcome idleness, happily interrupted by little more than swimming (Tarpon Bay Beach is the star of the local strands) and beachcombing (Turner Beach is best for shelling; the prime times of the day are the hours before and after low tide).</p><p>Sanibel offers 22 miles of paved bike paths, so the best way to get around is on two-wheels. Some hotels, including the Island Inn (see below) rent bicycles to guests. Otherwise, book your wheels at least five days in advance at Billy's Rentals.</p><p>Staying There: The friendly, well-run Island Inn features spacious and very comfortable beachfront rooms that don't break the bank (from about $280 a night). Alternatively, you can rent a luxury condo through Kingfisher Vacations (from about $180 a night).</p><p>Eating There: Book a table at Sweet Melissa's Cafe well in advance—the new American cooking is excellent. Head for the Clam Shack, owned by a couple from Rhode Island, for outstanding fried clams and lobster rolls.</p><p>For Finicky Families: Siesta Key</p><p>If you have teenagers who groan at the idea of a family vacation, tell them to check out \"Siesta Key\" on MTV. The reality show, now in its fourth season, is set on this 8-mile-longbarrier island off the coast of Sarasota in the Gulf of Mexico. The destination's real claim, however, are its beaches—nonstop miles of powdery white sand and good public amenities, like beach restaurants and chair and umbrella rentals, too.</p><p>While Siesta Beach is popular with visitors, locals prefer Siesta Key Public Access Beach 2, because it's quieter and rarely crowded. And for a cloudy day, a 10-minute drive to Sarasota on the mainland offers one of the best small museums in the South, the Ringling, and great theater, ballet, movie theaters and shopping. Bonus: Sarasota is also home to an unusually user-friendly airport, with direct flights from Boston, Chicago, New York and other cities.</p><p>Staying There: The Hyatt Residence Club Sarasota set on Siesta Key Beach offers waterfront suites with well-equipped kitchenettes, plus a pool and gym (from about $870 a night). Or rent a villa or an apartment through Siesta Key Luxury Rental Properties (from $210 a night).</p><p>Eating There: With a bohemian beach-shack atmosphere and an appealingly eclectic menu, the Cottage is a favorite among visitors and locals alike; don't miss the seared tuna club sandwich.</p><p>For Privacy Seekers: Fisher Island</p><p>Fisher Island has been a world apart ever since it was created when a federal dredging project to improve the port of Miami separated it from Miami Beach in 1905. Over the years, the small island, just 173 acres, was bought and sold by a succession of American businessmen. In the 1920s, auto magnate Carl Fisher traded the island with William K. Vanderbilt II in exchange for a yacht. Vanderbilt built a sumptuous private estate, including the still-standing Mediterranean-style mansion designed by Palm Beach architect Maurice Fatio.</p><p>Today, the exclusive island remains a private luxury community that regularly ranks as one of the richest single ZIP Codes in the U.S., only accessible from the mainland by private boat or a ferry service that runs 24 hours a day from a landing off the causeway that connects Miami to Miami Beach.</p><p>Staying There: The Fisher Island Club, only open to nonresidents by referral from a member, offers an array of cosseting accommodations, ranging from hotel rooms to historic cottages and villas. Every booking includes use of a golf cart to get around the island. Guests get access to the immaculately groomed sands of the beach club and a P.B. Dye-designed golf course, one of the most coveted courses in South Florida. There are also 17 tennis courts (membership fee is $350,000 plus dues; room rates on request only).</p><p>Eating There: The Fisher Island Club hosts several restaurants, including the Garwood Lounge in the Vanderbilt Mansion.</p><p>For Old-Fashioned, Old-Money Florida: Gasparilla</p><p>This slender strand of white sand dangling off the west coast of Florida was once a favorite vacation destination of swells like the DuPonts and J.P. Morgan, who arrived in their private train carriages. Now, most visitors fly into Fort Myers airport, which is about 80 minutes south of Gasparilla by car, or by private plane to the Boca Grande Jet Center or Coral Creek Airport, just across Gasparilla Sound. Those who arrive with pets in tow usually find their way to Dog Beach, a serene place to stroll with your pooch. But Boca Grande Pass Beach is the real winner—as idyllic a setting for sunbathing and swimming as it is for manatee watching.</p><p>Staying There: Architect Francis Kennard designed the Gasparilla Inn and Club in 1913, taking his inspiration from the wood-shingled \"Frame Vernacular\" seaside architecture of Cape Cod. Many of the Inn's original clients were well-born Bostonians who came to winter. Generation after generation of the same families holiday here, so book as far in advance as possible, and note that the inn remains a rather dressy place; see the website for the dress code (from $285 a night). If the Gasparilla Inn and Club is full, or you find its room rates too steep, try Parsley Baldwin for a good selection of holidays rentals (from about $180 a night).</p><p>Eating There: Beyond the resorts, Gasparilla is home to some very good restaurants, including Newlin's Gourmet, praised for its lobster rolls and chicken salad, and Scarpa's, for Italian cooking and seafood.</p><p>For Sporty Sojourns: Amelia Island</p><p>Forty minutes northeast of Jacksonville, Amelia has 13 miles of magnificent beaches and one of the most charming small towns in Florida, Fernandina Beach. It's also one of the sportier Sea Islands—sea kayaking, wind surfing, fishing, hang gliding and horseback riding are all on offer.</p><p>If you're unsure how to choose the island's best beach, regulars vouch for Burney Park, equipped with lifeguards, showers and picnic tables. The park is located in historic American Beach, a 200-acre area that was once a vacation destination for wealthy African-Americans and is now the first stop on the Florida Black Heritage Trail.</p><p>Staying There: For a first-rate resort and golf course, book the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island (from about $980 a night). Or go for one-of-a-kind charm at the 17 room Amelia Schoolhouse Inn, which was created from an 1886 red brick school on the National List of Historic Places.</p><p>Eating There: Don't miss the shrimp and grits at Burlingameand swing by the Palace Saloon, a favorite haunt of the Carnegies and Rockefellers when Fernandina Beach was a swanky resort during the 1880s.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
