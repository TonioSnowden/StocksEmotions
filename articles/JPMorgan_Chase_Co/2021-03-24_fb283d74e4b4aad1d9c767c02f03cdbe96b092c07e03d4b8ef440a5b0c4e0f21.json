  "title": "Global banks' $750bn in fossil fuels finance conflicts with green pledges",
  "text": "<p>Global banks provided $750bn in financing to coal, oil and gas companies last year, despite many having pledged to back the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28462108-5897-4a91-93d2-5aed4b7ad186\">Paris climate accord</a> and cut their funding for fossil fuels, according to a new study by an activist group.</p> <p>BNP Paribas stood out for the largest absolute increase in funding to fossil fuel companies, with a 41 per cent annual rise to $41bn, according to the latest analysis by the Rainforest Action Network.</p> <p>This was despite the French bank positioning itself as a leader in green finance and signing a UN-backed commitment to “<a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/collective-commitment/\">align its portfolio</a>” to keep global warming below 2C. It has provided a total of $121bn since the Paris accord.</p> <p>US banks continue to be the largest financiers of fossil fuel companies. JPMorgan Chase remained the leading player with $317bn of funding provided through lending and underwriting since 2016. However, it reduced the amount of financing by 20 per cent to $51bn in 2020. </p> <p>Citigroup followed in second place, providing $48bn of funding last year, down from $53bn the previous year, for a total of $238bn in financing since 2016.</p> <p>Wells Fargo reduced its fossil fuel financing the most in 2020, reporting a steep decline of 42 per cent to issue $26bn in funding, but the fall was not primarily due to its climate policies. </p> <p>The bank, which is the largest backer of the US fracking industry and has provided a total of $223bn in finance since 2016, chalked up the decline to the oil price slump, which led to “reduced [acquisition and divestiture] volumes, a significant widening of non-investment grade spreads and a pullback in the bank market”.</p> <p>In total, the world's 60 largest banks have provided $3.8tn to fossil fuel companies since 2016, when the Paris agreement came into effect.</p> <p>Overall, lending and debt and equity underwriting for the sector fell by 9 per cent to $750bn in 2020, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\">climate change</a> experts do not see this drop as a sign that banks are making good on their climate promises.</p> <p>“It's essentially a Covid blip until proven otherwise. And history does suggest that's what it is,” said Alison Kirsch, lead climate and energy researcher at the Rainforest Action Network. Even with fossil fuel demand falling during global lockdowns, banks still provided more capital to oil, gas and coal companies in 2020 than they did in 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>The overall trend “is still heading definitively in the wrong direction”, the RAN report says.</p> <p>While RAN gave BNP Paribas credit for being an industry leader with strong exclusion policies on coal, oil and tar sands, the French bank had a “blind spot” on its financing of oil majors, said Lucie Pinson, founder and executive director of Reclaim Finance, an activist group.</p> <p>BNP Paribas would not comment but responded in a letter to authors of the RAN report that its funding for oil and gas companies grew less significantly than its funding to other sectors and it had “played a major role in stabilising the economy” by providing liquidity to companies hit by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">pandemic.</a></p> <p>The bulk of BNP's fossil fuel funding last year went to BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell, all of which have said they will cut their emissions and invest in renewables. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/98272dcd-9447-4c02-a506-492004092798.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>“I'm not saying don't support any of these companies. I'm saying don't support these companies if they haven't committed to stop fossil fuel expansion,” Pinson said. “You need to be serious and push them to really put on hold the expansion and development of new fossil fuel reserves before writing them an unconditional cheque.”</p> <p>In recent weeks top US banks, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have all made <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c1f9ea0-42b7-4ea1-9396-d3c832f20350\">commitments</a> to reduce their “financed emissions”. But according to RAN, most banks' net-zero plans are “dangerously weak, half-baked or vague”.</p> <p>However, there is evidence emerging that campaigns from pressure groups — backed by institutional investors supporting environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG — are now accelerating change in the industry after years of resistance. </p> <p>Earlier this month HSBC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f976312-532d-4a4b-b189-8ab98c469827\">avoided</a> a potential shareholder revolt at its annual meeting by amending its climate policy to incorporate the demands of activists following months of negotiations. Europe's largest bank has now proposed to set formal, near-term targets to reduce its exposure to carbon-intensive assets and report on its progress. </p> <p>HSBC was involved in $23bn of fossil fuel financing in 2020, according to the RAN report, down from $28bn the year before, for a total of $111bn since 2016.</p> <p>Other banks such as Barclays are still resisting pressure to move faster. Last year, while adopting an “ambition” for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9ededd2-ddfc-498a-b63c-409a9e4b43c3\">rebuffed</a> a more robust resolution from the ShareAction charity backed by some of its largest investors. </p> <p>The London-based lender's own plan was criticised for being a watered-down version lacking solid, measurable interim commitments. While Barclays introduced some targets in November, it still faces another shareholder resolution and round of protest at its annual meeting in May.</p> <p>The RAN report ranked Barclays as the biggest fossil fuel financier based in Europe, extending $28bn in credit last year for a total of $144bn since 2016.</p> <p>Climate change is increasingly being examined by regulators including the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210218a.htm\">US Federal Reserve</a>, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank as a material threat to the stability of the global financial system. </p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b734848-1287-4106-b866-7d07bc9d7eb8\">the ECB said</a> a stress test revealed rising global temperatures are “a major source of systemic risk” because of the probability of mass loan defaults from thousands of corporate borrowers.</p> <p>As a result, the European bank supervisor is preparing to raise the amount of capital required at lenders it considers to have disproportionately high levels of climate risk on their balance sheets.</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ftclimate/\"><em>@ftclimate</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4caa4dbd-e572-48fd-8d24-40e5313adaa1\"><em>Stop finance flowing for fossil fuel extraction / From Matthew Goodwin, Director, Waste Knot Energy, London W1, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Billy Nauman in New York and Stephen Morris in London 2021 'Global banks' $750bn in fossil fuels finance conflicts with green pledges' FT.com 24 March.
