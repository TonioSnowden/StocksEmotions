  "text": "<p>A BaFin employee has rebuked Germany's largest online bank ING Germany in court for being too late in flagging suspicious trading activities of a potentially criminal client.</p> <p>The rare public criticism of an individual bank by Germany's financial regulator was made at a district court hearing in Frankfurt on Tuesday, where a 45-year-old former senior funds manager of Union Investment is charged with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0e38570-eae6-4359-af9f-a7e2becd6e4f\">large-scale insider trading</a>.</p> <p>The defendant last week admitted to “front-running” investment decisions he made on behalf of his employer on 55 occasions between April and September last year, making €8.1m in net profit. </p> <p>According to the public prosecutor, he used a private brokerage account at ING Germany to buy and sell derivatives aimed at retail investors on blue-chips that he traded for Union, including Infineon, Deutsche Post and MTU, sometimes spending €1m per transaction.</p> <p>The total trading volume over the six months until his arrest added up to €45m, generating significant fees for the online broker. </p> <p>Frank Mühlhans, a BaFin expert on insider trading, told judges on Tuesday that the defendant's broker flagged the highly suspicious trades relatively late and only after several issuers had warned the regulator about the dubious activity. </p> <p>“With regard to this broker, I am not surprised about this,” Mühlhans said. He pointed to his past experiences with suspicious activity reports from the bank. “They are filing a lot [of suspicious activity reports] but they are surprisingly lax with regard to the significant cases.”</p> <p>ING Germany was not named explicitly on Tuesday but, in court last week, the public prosecutor had identified the lender as the defendant's broker. With 9.5m clients, ING Germany is Germany's largest online-only retail bank and one of the country's largest retail stock brokers. </p> <p>BaFin and Mühlhans declined to comment. ING Germany declined to comment on the case. The bank told the Financial Times that stock brokers were legally required to flag suspicious client activities that might represent insider trading or market manipulation. “ING Germany is complying with this obligation and operates appropriate transaction monitoring systems and reporting procedures,” it added.</p> <p>The defendant said last week that frustration over his €440,000 pay in 2019 had prompted him to start insider trading. After receiving only half the pay rise he had hoped for in April last year, he felt “offended” and decided to recoup the rest himself.</p> <p>He said that initially he only aimed to make about €500,000 with his side investments: “Things then got out of control. It became an addiction. Every successful trade generated a feeling of elation and superiority.”</p> <p>Mühlhans told the court on Tuesday that he found it surprising that the experienced funds manager had apparently assumed that his large-scale insider trading could go undetected. He pointed out that the first suspicious trades were flagged by issuers of the certificates within weeks. </p> <p>One of the first banks to query the trades was JPMorgan. </p> <p>“They were suspecting front-running early on,” he said, adding that highly leveraged bets on single stocks that are always successful quickly trigger the issuer's attention. “It's like in Las Vegas: If you always win, you cheat,” said Mühlhans. JPMorgan declined to comment. </p> <p>The funds manager is due to be sentenced on Thursday.</p><p>Source: Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt 2021 'BaFin points to ING Germany's tardy response in multimillion euro insider-trading case' FT.com 29 September.
