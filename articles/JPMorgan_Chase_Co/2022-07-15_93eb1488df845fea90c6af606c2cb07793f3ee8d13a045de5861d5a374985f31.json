  "title": "Citigroup's Second Quarter Profit Falls 27%; Revenue, profit and returns at the bank all top Wall Street expectations",
  "text": "<p>Citigroup Inc. said Friday its second-quarter earnings slid 27%.</p><p>The bank reported a profit of $4.55 billion, or $2.19 per share, compared with $6.19 billion, or $2.85 a share, a year earlier. That beat the $1.68 per share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Revenue rose 11% to $19.64 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast for $18.4 billion.</p><p>Shares rose 5% in premarket trading. The stock was down 27% this year heading into Friday, but has fallen less than some big peers in recent months when investors started selling bank stocks on fears of a recession.</p><p>The profit was reduced by a $375 million charge to set aside funds for potential future loan losses. A year ago, the bank released $2.4 billion from its reserves, boosting profits in that period.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which reported Thursday, took a similar $428 million reserve. The charges belie the strength consumers and businesses continued to show in the second quarter, but reflect growing uncertainty among bankers about the future health of the U.S. economy.</p><p>In Citi's institutional clients group, which contains its investment bank and serves corporate clients, revenue rose 20% and profit rose 16%.</p><p>The bank was boosted by a strong trading quarter amid market turmoil, with markets revenue up 25% on a 31% increase in fixed-income trading, the dominant business for Citi's results.</p><p>Revenue rose 28% in the services and treasury and trade businesses that help big companies manage and move money around the globe. Volatile currency markets complicate the lives of big international companies, forcing them to bolster deposits at Citigroup and increase trading and hedging. Some big U.S. companies have recently said that the strong dollar will hurt their earnings.</p><p>Gains there were offset by a 46% drop in fees from investment banking. Deal making slowed, along with stock and bond sales.</p><p>Revenue in the consumer bank and wealth management operations rose 6% while its profit dropped 69% on the loan-loss reserves.</p><p>Consumers continued spending and borrowing in the quarter. Consumer spending on Citi-issued credit cards rose 16% in the quarter and balances they carried increased.</p><p>Expenses at the bank rose 8% to $12.4 billion. Citigroup is under regulatory orders to improve its vast systems that monitor risks for the bank and its clients, a multiyear project that requires heavy spending.</p><p>Still, its return on tangible common equity, a closely watched profitability metric, hit 11.2%, far higher than the 8.8% analysts had predicted.</p><p>Citigroup has announced plans to sell international consumer businesses in an effort to simplify and focus the bank. Revenue fell and those businesses posted a loss.</p><p>Total loans fell, but increased for both big clients and consumers in businesses the bank isn't selling. The bank's profitability on lending increased thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases. Net interest margin, a gauge on lending profits, rose to 2.24% from 2.05% in the first quarter.</p><p>Bank Earnings Center</p><p>More coverage and analysis on the latest financial results from Wall Street</p><p>* JPMorgan Sees Economic Trouble Brewing</p><p>* Morgan Stanley Profit Hit by Deal Making Drop</p><p>* Wells Fargo Revenue Falls Short of Expectations</p><p>* BlackRock's Assets Decline Amid Market Downturn</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Defensive Bank Moves Aren't Whole Story</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup's Second Quarter Profit Falls 27%</p>",
