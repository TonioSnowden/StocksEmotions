  "text": "<p>But the ones that took on the most risk and continued to work — in some cases to transport essential workers and deliver food to people quarantined with COVID-19 —- were rewarded.</p><p>These workers earned more during the pandemic than they did from gig jobs prior to the pandemic, according to a report published by the JPMorgan Chase Institute JPM.</p><p>In the months leading up to the pandemic, some 2.5% of American families earned income from doing gig work, according to the report, which drew upon data from 38 million Chase personal checking accounts; identifying details had been removed from the accounts.</p><p>But at the onset of the pandemic, that figure dropped to 1.9% of families each month earning money from doing gig work, a 25% decline from pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>At the same time, median monthly income for drivers, non-transport workers such as dog walkers, and online sellers for the most part hovered at their pre-pandemic levels of $500 a month for transport and non-transport work, and $100 a month for online sellers.</p><p>That implies “an increase in overall income among platform participants during the pandemic,” the authors of the report, Fiona Greig, co-president of JPMorgan Chase Institute, and Daniel M. Sullivan, consumer research lead there, wrote.</p><p>In contrast, people who worked in the gig economy by renting out their homes or cars saw a large jump in median monthly earnings during the pandemic compared to before it.</p><p>That's either because fewer people rented homes or cars during the pandemic and the ones who continued to had more inventory to offload — resulting in an uptick in revenue. Or, “It could reflect an increase in prices or longer-term rentals as families adjusted to pandemic lifestyle,” Greig and Sullivan wrote.</p>",
