  "text": "<p>The Santa Monica, Calif.-based firm cited a deteriorating economy for its warning, sending its shares tumbling. Shares of tech companies dependent on advertising, such as Alphabet Inc. GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Pinterest Inc. PINS, and Twitter Inc. TWTR also fell in the wake of the profit warning.</p><p>See now: Snap's warning of a weaker outlook sends ripples through tech stocksHowever, Snap is far from reflective of the overall market, according to Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at media agency GroupM.</p><p>\"A company that has a shortfall in the tens of millions should not be causing market capitalization in the hundreds of billions to plummet,\" he said.</p><p>Wieser believes that, fueled by rapid growth during the pandemic, Snap's projections had been unrealistic.</p><p>\"Too many media owners believe there was no limit to how much they can grow except for their ambition,\" he said. \"The problem is that these ambitions run into reality â€¦ you can't grow faster than the economy forever, unless you become the economy.\"</p><p>Buoyed by strong revenue and user growth last year, Snap shares rose to reach a 52-week high of $83.34 on Sep. 24, 2021. However, the company's shares have fallen more than 69% this year and were trading at $14.55 on Thursday.

Speaking at an investor conference last week Dimon said it's not yet clear whether the \"hurricane\" is a minor storm or a \"superstorm.\"</p><p>While inflationary pressures have been weighing on the economy for months, Dimon also cited concerns about the impact of the war in Ukraine on commodity prices, warning that oil prices could surpass $150a barrel.</p><p>See now: JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon sees economic 'hurricane' coming: 'Better brace yourself'</p><p>Snap's profit warning shouldn't be taken out of context, says ad industry expert</p>",
