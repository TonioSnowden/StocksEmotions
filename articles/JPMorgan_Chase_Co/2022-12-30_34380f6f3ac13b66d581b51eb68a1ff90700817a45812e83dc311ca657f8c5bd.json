  "title": "Japan's Banks Get a Shot in the Arm; Senescent Japanese bank shares are showing new signs of vigor after the Bank of Japan's policy shift",
  "text": "<p>Shares of many Japanese financial companies have notched double-digit gains since then. The country's largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, or MUFG, has soared 15%, while insurer Dai-ichi Life has gone up 14%.</p><p>The reason is simple: Banks and insurers can now reinvest their capital into bonds with higher yields while longer-term loan rates like mortgages should also rise. A 0.25 percentage point increase may not seem big. But for Japanese banks, which have suffered from anemic growth and paltry returns for years, it could be a helpful boost. More important, if the tweak signals a shift in Japan's ultralow interest-rate regime, more rate increases could be coming down the road.</p><p>The BOJ insists the move isn't true monetary tightening, but rather a technical tweak to smooth the yield curve of government bonds, because the 10-year yield was artificially low due to the central bank's policy. The 10-year yield was indeed suppressed relative to other tenors and it moved the most after the BOJ's move: from around 0.25% to 0.44%. But the whole yield curve has shifted upward: Japan's 30-year yield has increased by around 0.1 percentage points, for example.</p><p>And Japan's largest banks are still trading at deep discounts to their tangible book values. MUFG, for example, trades at 0.7 times, while Mizuho Financial is at 0.6 times. Some smaller regional banks are even cheaper. In comparison, JPMorgan Chase trades at nearly two times its tangible book value. Granted, Japanese banks have long traded cheaper than their global peers, but their valuations have fallen even further since Japan embarked on its negative interest-rate policy in 2016.</p><p>Japanese banks may not have been the best investments in the negative interest-rate era, but that could change quickly if Japan's rate policy really is at a turning point.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Japan's Banks Get a Shot in the Arm</p>",
