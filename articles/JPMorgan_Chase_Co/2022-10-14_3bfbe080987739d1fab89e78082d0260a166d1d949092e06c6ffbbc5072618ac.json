  "text": "<p>   In an email, Mr. Kohm said he didn't work on any issues involving the companies he owned. He also said he hasn't realized a profit on any of the stocks he owns because he hasn't sold them. </p><p>   Joseph Simons, FTC chairman from 2018 until January 2021, disclosed more than 1,300 trades during his tenure. Fewer than a dozen involved individual stocks, the rest mutual funds and ETFs. </p><p>   Half of the individual stocks he reported owning were tech and telecom companies involved in FTC reviews. </p><p>   The FTC spokesman said Mr. Simons' investments weren't ethics violations because stock investments of $15,000 or less aren't deemed conflicts. \"He sought and received counsel and took steps that were needed in order to comply,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   When the FTC issued orders in March 2019 to the several broadband providers seeking information, Mr. Simons held between $1,001 and $15,000 in AT&amp;T shares. He held the stock until August 2019, when he sold his stake. </p><p>   The same day he sold AT&amp;T Mr. Simons reported the sale of a stake in Charter Communications Inc., worth $1,001 to $15,000. Less than two weeks later, the FTC broadened the examination of privacy rules to include Charter. </p><p>   Mr. Simons also held some tech stocks when the FTC on Feb. 11, 2020, ordered the largest players -- Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft -- to provide more information about their previous acquisitions, as part of its examination of the sector's growth. In a news release announcing the orders, Mr. Simons said they would \"help us continue to keep tech markets open and competitive, for the benefit of consumers.\" </p><p>   The next day, Mr. Simons sold between $2,002 and $30,000 worth of stock in Oracle, a rival tech company, according to his disclosures. He didn't sell his Microsoft stock. </p><p>   By the time he left office, the price of his Microsoft shares was up 140% from when he became chairman. </p><p>   Mr. Simons declined to comment on his holdings. </p><p>   A former acting director of the FTC office that enforces antitrust laws owned stock in three companies that came under scrutiny by the agency during his tenure. </p><p>   Abbott Lipsky was named acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition in February 2017. In a disclosure he filed later that year, Mr. Lipsky reported owning nearly 90 individual stocks, some of which were in a family trust of which he was a trustee and a beneficiary. He reported that the trust held between $50,001 and $100,000 in stock of Emerson Electric Co., one-fifth of which was his share. </p><p>   At the time, FTC competition officials were investigating Emerson's planned $3.15 billion acquisition of a unit of Pentair PLC. In April, nearly two months after Mr. Lipsky started running the competition bureau, the FTC said it had reached an agreement with Emerson in which it would sell Pentair's switchbox business to settle the FTC's charges that the acquisition would violate antitrust law. </p><p>   In early May, Mr. Lipsky reported buying between $1,001 and $15,000 in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. stock. He already owned shares in the company, according to his disclosure. </p><p>   Seven weeks later, on June 29, the FTC cleared an acquisition involving JPMorgan. </p><p>   Mr. Lipsky left the FTC on July 3, 2017. He didn't respond to requests for comment. Ethics officials certified he was in compliance with the law. </p><p>   An FTC pamphlet for new employees in 2019 cautioned them against conflicts and urged them to stay abreast of their financial holdings. \"Cheese gets better with age -- financial data doesn't,\" it said. </p><p>   An FTC ethics lawyer who helped produce the pamphlet owned stocks herself in companies the agency investigated. </p><p>   Lorielle Pankey and family members owned between $65,002 and $150,000 of Visa Inc. shares at the outset of an FTC inquiry into whether Visa and Mastercard Inc. had prevented retailers from using competing debit networks. The card companies have said they comply with the law. </p><p>   On July 13, an account controlled by Ms. Pankey's family sold $5,613 of Visa stock, according to her disclosures and the FTC spokesman. On July 31, Visa disclosed in a quarterly report that the FTC had requested documents in June. </p><p>   Ms. Pankey and her family kept most of their Visa shares, valued at between $100,002 and $200,000 at the end of 2020. Visa shares more than doubled from the time Ms. Pankey started at the FTC in June 2016 to the end of 2020. The FTC inquiry is continuing. </p><p>   Ms. Pankey said she had fully complied with ethics requirements and said any suggestion she had violated the rules was \"completely false.\" </p><p>   \"I am not now and have never in the course of my FTC tenure personally and substantially participated in any FTC particular matter affecting the financial interests of Visa,\" she said by email. \"Further, I have never used nonpublic information acquired in the course of my FTC duties for the private gain of myself or others.\" </p><p>   The FTC spokesman said Ms. Pankey doesn't work on FTC investigations of companies and stocks she owns are held in brokerage accounts opened by her father when she was a child. He said that she didn't direct any stock trades and that the Visa sale was made by a financial adviser who manages the account. </p><p>   Another FTC official made large trades in Visa and Mastercard amid the investigation. </p><p>   When the probe became public in November 2019, FTC Chief Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell held between $1 million and $5 million in Mastercard stock and between $100,001 and $250,000 in Visa shares, according to his disclosure form. </p><p>   On Jan. 2, 2020, Mr. Chappell sold all of his Visa stock and between $250,001 and $500,000 of his Mastercard holdings. It was the first time he had sold shares in the companies in at least four years. </p><p>   Since then, Mr. Chappell has sold Mastercard stock three more times, totaling between $400,003 and $850,000. At the end of last year, he reported owning between $500,001 and $1 million in Mastercard shares. </p><p>   The FTC spokesman said Mr. Chappell \"operates independently from the agency\" and \"has no knowledge of or involvement with FTC investigations or enforcement actions and in fact is strictly separated from any agency actions with respect to matters that come or could come before the Commission since he may be tasked with adjudicating these matters.\" </p><p>   In an interview, Mr. Chappell said that he didn't work on the FTC's investigation into Visa and Mastercard and that in his role, he is made aware of FTC investigations only once the agency files a lawsuit. \"I don't know who they are investigating and I don't care,\" Mr. Chappell said. </p><p>   He said he adheres to agency rules on stock ownership and attends the FTC's annual training sessions. </p><p>   He said he didn't know the FTC was investigating Mastercard or Visa until the Journal brought it to his attention. Said Mr. Chappell: \"I can assure you that I don't know anything about that.\" </p><p></p>",
