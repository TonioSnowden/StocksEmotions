  "text": "<p>But while the Nasdaq continues to lag on the year, it's still full of companies that Wall Street isn't about to give up on. Our call of the day from Citigroup rounds up some of the best internet stock bets from the U.S. and elsewhere right now, giving the sector a thumbs-up.</p><p>“Against a backdrop of stepped-up regulation, geopolitical tensions and yet to be fully contained COVID-19 cases, we believe the internet sector will remain one of the more attractive options in global portfolio allocation given technology innovation and scale efficiency, and as investors weigh growth potential vs. risks,” said Citi's Global Internet team, in a recent conference call with clients.</p><p>But not all of those stocks are a sure thing. U.S. analyst Jason Bazinet notes that investment banks and institutional investors are “just too bullish” on the strength of advertising dollars going forward for U.S. internet stocks. After a big growth rebound from the second quarter of 2020, Wall Street banks see even stronger ad growth going forward — $107 billion this year and $70 to $75 billion in 2022 and 2023, he said.</p><p>While the institutional investors credit that growth to a “new era of higher ad intensity for every dollar of economic activity,” Bazinet says it's really down to a rebound in economic activity, but that e-commerce has “already rolled over.” For that reason, he isn't recommending investors buy Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, Facebook FB, Twitter TWTR, Pinterest PINS or Snapchat parent Snap SNAP.</p><p>“We think investors would be far better served to buy Amazon AMZN where we're just a few quarters away from locking those difficult comps, and the stock has sort of underperformed because of those difficult e-commerce comps,” says the analyst.</p><p>He also highlights an under-the-radar segment that plays into that advertising, with companies like IronSource IS or AppLovin APP that are “just thriving” in the area of mobile game advertising. Wall Street estimates aren't too high on the sector either, he says.</p><p>Citi also came up with a few China picks, as analysts weighed on the regulatory pressures the tech sector has been seeing this year. With e-commerce a key cog in the domestic consumption wheel, it's probably least at risk from Beijing moves, said analyst Alicia Yap. That said, online gaming is a riskier subset and least likely to find government support because that spending doesn't recirculate back to society, only to companies.</p><p>Citi's top China picks include buy-rated e-retailer JD.com JD, “because it still has the user growth story” for active transaction users, and is one of few companies likely to see margin improvement trends in the coming year.</p><p>Citi also recommends Baidu BIDU, which Yap sees as less exposed to regulatory headlines. The company is also being granted a few smart city projects — a government aim to use technology to improve urban infrastructure and services. “That should demonstrate Baidu's ability on ensuring the protection of data transfer and data storage, etc.,” said Yap.</p><p>Elsewhere, analyst Brian Gong said regulatory pressure probably won't hit China video-sharing website Bilibili BILI too bad. He's positive on the stock “thanks to its healthy ecosystem, continuous growth on a user scale, and the decent potential on monetization.”</p><p>Other picks include Europe's Delivery Hero XE:DHER and Just Eat Takeway GRUB, and mutilnational conglomerates Prosus PROSY and Yandex YNDX out of Russia.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The Senate is due to vote Thursday on legislation that would narrowly avoid a government shutdown by keeping it funded into early December.</p><p>https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/1443366345001902082Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify to a House panel on COVID-19 relief at 10 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>On the data front, weekly jobless claims and a revision to second-quarter gross domestic product are due ahead of the market open.
