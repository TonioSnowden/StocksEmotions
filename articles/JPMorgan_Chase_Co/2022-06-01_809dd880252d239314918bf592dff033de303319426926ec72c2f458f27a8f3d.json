  "title": "Biden Says No Short-Term Fix to High Energy, Grocery Prices; President says he 'can't take immediate action' to lower record-high gasoline prices",
  "text": "<p>\"There's a lot going on right now, but the idea we're going to be able to, you know, click a switch, bring down the cost of gasoline, is not likely in the near term, nor is it with regard to food,\" Mr. Biden said Wednesday.</p><p>Gasoline prices hit a record-high $4.67 for a gallon of regular on Wednesday, according to AAA. Meanwhile, annual inflation is trending above 8%, a four-decade high, according to the Labor Department's consumer-price index.</p><p>\"We can't take immediate action that I'm aware of yet to figure out how we're going to bring down the price of gasoline back to $3 a gallon,\" Mr. Biden said, answering questions from reporters. \"But we can compensate by providing for other necessary costs for families by bringing those down.\"</p><p>He said taxes could be increased on corporations and the wealthy to help pay for deficit reduction and provide relief for families. He said such plans, which Democrats are discussing in Congress, wouldn't be inflationary. To win passage for tax increases, which Republicans staunchly oppose, Mr. Biden would need uniform support from his own party in the Senate, a goal that has eluded him for months.</p><p>Mr. Biden's statements followed a comment from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on television Tuesday evening that she had been wrong on the trajectory of inflation over the past year. Together, the comments show the depth of the challenge the administration faces in discussing inflation, which has dominated the economic and political landscapes and frustrated White House officials.</p><p>As part of a broader push to publicly address inflation, Mr. Biden, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, argued the administration is addressing rising prices and that the economy broadly remains strong. Administration officials are also increasingly acknowledging that the Federal Reserve, which is largely independent of the Biden administration, plays the most central role in combating inflation.</p><p>Given the persistence of the high prices, as well as the difficulty in slowing their rise, reshaping Americans' views of the economy in the coming months will be difficult.</p><p>\"This is going to be the defining issue of the midterm elections,\" said Ken Spain, a Republican political consultant who helped lead messaging efforts for House Republicans in 2010. \"This issue is now entrenched in the minds of American voters and it will be very difficult to close the gap between now and November.\"</p><p>Jason Furman, who served as a top economic adviser to then-President Barack Obama, said the broader messaging push represented the clearest and most coherent articulation Mr. Biden has given on inflation so far.</p><p>\"I think there's a sense that they've been saying things and it's not all breaking through,\" Mr. Furman said of the administration. The renewed push \"is a way to remind people in some sense of what they're already doing about this, while being completely clear that they understand the pain people are feeling.\"</p><p>Price increases threaten to overshadow several bright spots in the economy, such as low unemployment and job gains.</p><p>There were 11.4 million job openings at the end of April, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That was just below the highest level on records back to 2000, set the month before, and nearly double the number of unemployed Americans seeking work. Economists forecast that Friday's jobs report will show the May unemployment rate matching the half-century low set just before the pandemic began.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded at a faster rate in May, despite facing supply-chain constraints, the Institute for Supply Management said Wednesday.</p><p>But even as the administration pins its hopes of taming inflation on the Fed, the central bank's moves also risk slowing the economy, with some forecasters projecting a recession in the coming years.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said Wednesday he sees increasing risk of an economic downturn when discussing the Fed's ability to slow inflation at an investor conference.</p><p>\"That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"We just don't know if it's a minor one or superstorm Sandy. You have to brace yourself.\"</p><p>The Fed on Wednesday began shrinking its $9 trillion asset portfolio, which has doubled since March 2020 as it embarked on a massive stimulus program.</p><p>The central bank will allow up to $17.5 billion in mortgage securities and $30 billion in Treasurys to mature every month as part of a plan to passively shrink its holdings through attrition.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note advanced Wednesday to 2.930%, from 2.842% Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move inversely.</p><p>The White House is planning for an economic messaging campaign that kicked off this week to stretch throughout the month of June. As part of it, Ms. Yellen appeared Tuesday evening on CNN, where she said her inflation projections were wrong in statements she made last year as consumer prices began their surge.</p><p>\"I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,\" Ms. Yellen told CNN. \"There have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn't, at the time, fully understand.\"</p><p>A White House official said Ms. Yellen's comments on being wrong were \"pointing out that there have been shocks to the economy that have exacerbated inflationary pressures which couldn't have been foreseen 18 months ago.\"</p><p>Last year, administration officials repeatedly said they expected elevated inflation to be temporary. Ms. Yellen in March 2021 said in an interview with ABC that the U.S. economy faced a \"small risk\" of inflation. \"I think it's manageable,\" she said.</p><p>Biden administration officials have maintained their policies—namely a $1.9 trillion aid package passed last year—have propelled the U.S. economic recovery, while mostly rejecting the idea that their actions contribute meaningfully to inflation, as many Republicans contend.</p><p>\"Some have a curious obsession with exaggerating impact of the Rescue Plan while ignoring the degree high inflation is global,\" White House adviser Gene Sperling said in a tweet Wednesday, while also noting that energy prices have been exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p>Even if the Fed is able to rapidly reduce inflation, voters may not give the Biden administration credit, said Brian Riedl, a former Republican budget aide who is now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.</p><p>\"Even if inflation slows down, the cost of living is still much higher than it was a year ago, it's just not accelerating,\" he said. \"All taming inflation does is stop the bleeding. It doesn't fix the higher prices.\"</p><p>Ken Thomas contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com and Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Says No Short-Term Fix to High Energy, Grocery Prices</p>",
