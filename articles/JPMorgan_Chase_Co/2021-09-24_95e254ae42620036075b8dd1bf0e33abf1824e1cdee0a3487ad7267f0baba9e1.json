  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>former UK chancellor <strong>George Osborne </strong>has won one of his first mandates since reinventing himself as an investment banker, securing his new employer <strong>Robey Warshaw</strong> a role advising a major metals group founded by the Russian oligarch <strong>Oleg Deripaska</strong>, people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf936f46-a6c8-4ca2-b0db-95fc1155a42f\">told the FT</a>.</p> <h2>Stephen Schwarzman's crash course in Chinese politics</h2> <p><strong>Blackstone </strong>boss <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong> is no stranger to navigating the choppy waters between Washington and the private sector, where the $648bn private equity behemoth he oversees reigns supreme.</p> <p>Now the buyout giant's collapsed $3bn deal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d746372b-6ab0-477f-9dda-4d7c06d47211\">to buy Soho China</a>, a property group, presents one of Schwarzman's biggest diplomatic challenges yet, after its billionaire founders were accused of trying to cash out on their business and “flee” to the US.</p> <p>It's the latest test for how the private capital industry, which controls the flow of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d0e6f18-2d56-4175-98c5-e13559bdbc25\">trillions of dollars</a>, will navigate the world's second-largest economy as it enters a new phase of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea1b79bf-cbe3-41d9-91da-0a1ba692309f\">economic uncertainty</a>.</p> <p>The property deal has had a “chilling effect” for rival companies planning big cross-border deals for assets considered “strategic” to the Chinese economy, a senior mergers and acquisitions lawyer in Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19e5002a-7ac8-45c8-ae7c-e33bcf731939\">told</a> the FT's Tabby Kinder and DD's Kaye Wiggins.</p> <p>Private equity groups have agreed transactions worth $26bn in China since the beginning of this year, far surpassing the $10bn of deals in the whole of 2019, figures from Dealogic show. Now, they'll need to reassess the risks of doing business in a market that is increasingly controlled by the government.</p> <p>At the centre is president<strong> Xi Jinping</strong>'s drive for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacf9b6a-326b-4aa9-a8f6-2456921e61ec\">“common prosperity”</a>, which has cracked down on foreign listings of Chinese companies. Beijing regulators' data security <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/deac99c5-502e-4432-8450-495fcc6619e2\">investigation</a> into the newly US-listed ride-hailing app <strong>Didi Chuxing</strong> last month was a warning to Wall Street and Chinese technology start-ups alike.</p> <p>The tumult surrounding <strong>Evergrande</strong>, the world's most indebted property developer, has also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ef786d6-6b6a-45b5-ae19-1c377f4c9e90\">spelt trouble</a> for foreign asset managers.</p> <p>A series of government crackdowns across <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ef38be2-9b4d-49a4-a812-97ad6d70ea6f\">technology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb9b60e-c78d-4b1f-9fa0-210a1a099671\">entertainment</a>, education, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a7476ee-bcd4-45ac-a165-3418e2de286a\">gaming</a> and cosmetic surgery sectors have also placed investors in a precarious spot. Chinese tutoring groups have served as a cautionary tale, suffering billions of dollars in losses when regulators effectively outlawed the sector from making a profit.</p> <p>Transactions worth $11.3bn involving China-based companies have been agreed but not yet completed, the Dealogic figures show, including the merger of the Canadian chain<strong> Tim Hortons</strong>' Chinese business with a US-listed special purpose acquisition company backed by the private equity group <strong>Ascendent Capital Partners</strong>.</p> <p>Those deals look more precarious now, as private equity groups are left guessing which industries Beijing will turn to next.</p> <h2>Toshiba's shareholders play hardball for a private equity takeover</h2> <p>Things may look fairly placid around <strong>Toshiba</strong> right now, but that is an illusion that bankers, lawyers, private equity firms and activist investors expect (many of them very eagerly) to be broken at some point over the next couple of months.</p> <p>The Toshiba board — reconstituted after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/825f549f-2a56-4bab-bf7f-157649eeb45d\">shareholder revolt</a> earlier this year — is laser-focused on assembling a strategic review of the tormented 140-year conglomerate.&#xa0;</p> <p>The review itself was forced on to Toshiba by a stunning defeat at an extraordinary general meeting earlier this year at the hands of a shareholder register that, unlike most Japanese companies, is now packed with activist and event-driven funds. These funds have tasted triumph, and that might now become a problem.</p> <p>There are several plausible conclusions that the review could come up with, from an unambitious reheating of previous turnround plans to more aggressive sales of big non-core assets. They could also, conceivably, be forced by their activist shareholders to consider a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19fb8d7c-faaa-4b15-86aa-53cb834204ef\">private equity-led buyout offer</a> in what would be Japan's largest-ever buyout.&#xa0;</p> <p>After several months of talks with the world's largest private equity firms, the board has narrowed the field to<strong> Bain Capital</strong>, <strong>KKR</strong> and <strong>Brookfield</strong>, people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10abee22-941e-4a6a-be24-12058f312dcb\">told</a> the FT's Leo Lewis and Kana Inagaki. But a deal with any of those firms would certainly require a blessing from the government that may prove elusive.</p> <p>Another key issue is that shareholders' expectations might have gotten too high. Before Toshiba's former chief executive <strong>Nobuaki Kurumatani</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fc03a35-4915-4f44-bfb2-f4b4db4f4196\">forced out</a> of his job earlier this year, news leaked that the private equity firm <strong>CVC </strong>had proposed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20004088-8007-4715-9199-45f681ae307b\">$20bn take-private offer</a> for Toshiba.</p> <p>CVC's takeover attempt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fc03a35-4915-4f44-bfb2-f4b4db4f4196\">never got off the ground</a>. But it did set a precedent as to what sort of price Toshiba's emboldened shareholders could expect for an exit. A lot of the big funds built their stakes when the stock was about ￥2,400 a share, but it's almost doubled since.</p> <p>The board's fear, according to another person close to the discussions, is that once a potential valuation is leaked, investors will demand a higher price and foil the chance of a potential deal.</p> <p>The top prize, in the eyes of the big shareholders, is the giant buyout and an exit at somewhere north of ￥7,000 a share. Second prize would be a series of huge asset sales (the elevator and air conditioning businesses are prime candidates) followed by a massive share buyback into which the activists would sell their stakes.&#xa0;</p> <p>After a year of boardroom turmoil, Toshiba's shareholders are unlikely to accept a timid revitalisation plan. The more aggressive funds have said that they'll reject any proposal if the review comes back without a delisting deal and a clear price.&#xa0;</p> <p>The review is due at the end of October, but everyone should expect the noise levels to rise ahead of that.</p> <h2>A new wave of IPOs confronts jittery equity markets</h2> <p>The management team at <strong>Toast</strong> could be forgiven for a little nervousness as the company finalised its $870m initial public offering earlier this week.</p> <p><strong>Elena Gomez</strong>, Toast's new chief financial officer, admitted she was keeping a close eye on markets as the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index suffered its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/952923b7-f421-407e-b14a-ad2ff190a134\">worst day in months</a> on Monday, but added “we have such conviction about our growth we tried not to worry”.</p> <p>Early evidence suggests Gomez was right to be confident. Toast, which provides technology for restaurants, priced its offering on Tuesday night above its target range, and the shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36111815-74a5-40ca-9348-e5e9391c0a1b\">jumped a further 50 per cent</a> on their first day of trading.</p> <p>Toast's performance will provide some reassurance to the wave of consumer-focused businesses hoping to follow it on to the market in the next few weeks, such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb5218c5-db96-41aa-9fcb-2f2d3be21080\"><strong>Allbirds</strong></a>,<strong> Rent the Runway</strong> and <strong>Warby Parker</strong>, the latter of which will complete a direct listing next week.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US IPO market has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/857c1286-d35e-404a-ae7c-8d04b7508810\">on a tear</a> for most of the year, but as it picks up from its summer lull, new arrivals face an increasingly uncertain environment.</p> <p>Slowing economic growth, the Delta coronavirus variant, Federal Reserve tapering plans and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ac2d661-5a63-4768-91a1-182f02b2afa5\">Evergrande crisis</a> have all contributed to what analysts at<strong> JPMorgan Chase</strong> described as a “wall of worry” in equity markets.</p> <p>Toast managed to shrug off short-term concerns about the health of the US consumer by emphasising a long-term shift toward digital services in the restaurant industry. As investors grow pickier, other companies are trying to convince them of their own structural tailwinds — be it superior technology, an emphasis on sustainability or hoping that the shift to remote working becomes permanent.</p> <p><strong>Gareth McCartney</strong>, global co-head of equity capital markets at <strong>UBS</strong>, says stock markets are still receptive to consumer-facing businesses, particularly those that come with a techy sheen. But, he added, “the bar has gone up relative to where we were earlier in the year”.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Harit Talwar</strong>, the <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> executive who spearheaded its push into consumer banking, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d6c25e9-9efd-4fbd-ab2f-b0e471f3c948\">leaving</a> the investment bank in October.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup </strong>healthcare investment banker <strong>Jorge Barreiro</strong> has been hired by <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>as a managing director, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/deutsche-bank-poaches-health-care-it-banker-from-citigroup?sref=OziMsGoK\">says Bloomberg</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>The private equity firm <strong>One Rock Capital Partners</strong> has appointed <strong>Fola Adamolekun </strong>as general counsel and chief compliance officer, based in New York.
