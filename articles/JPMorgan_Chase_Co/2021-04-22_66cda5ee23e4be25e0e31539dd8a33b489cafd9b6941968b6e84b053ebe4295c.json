  "text": "<p>Conference organiser Informa posted a £1.1bn pre-tax loss for 2020 and cut the value of its brand portfolio to reflect long-term damage from the pandemic. </p> <p>The company said it had taken a £593m impairment charge on several of its brands due to the “impact of Covid-19 on the long-term trading outlook for our physical events”.</p> <p>Event cancellations meant revenues slipped 43 per cent to £1.66bn in the year ending December. Adjusted profit before tax, which excluded Covid-related charges and costs, was £170m compared with £821m in the previous year.</p> <p>Informa said 2021 would be a “transition year” for physical events as “permissions progressively return and B2B customer confidence rebuilds”. It forecast revenues of at least £1.7bn in the next financial year.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> said it is trading in line with its full year expectations and the UK housing market continues to be resilient. The housebuilder said that while it remained committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, it was not planning to make a capital return in 2021 and will review cash levels&#xa0;at full-year results next March.</p> <p>Brick maker <strong>Ibstock</strong> said 2021 has started well, with trading “modestly ahead of expectations”, and management remains confident in prospects for the year. Demand both from new-build housing and the maintenance market has been robust, it said. In light of market conditions Ibstock said it was restarting work to upgrade its mothballed Atlas site in the West Midlands, which was first set out in early 2020. The total cost of the project will be £60m, the company said. </p> <p><strong>Rentokil Initial</strong> reported a “good start to the year”. First-quarter group ongoing revenue was up 15.4 per cent year on year, including a 6 per cent contribution from acquisitions. Demand for disinfection services meant hygiene delivered a 48.5 per cent increase in ongoing revenue while core pest control operations delivered ongoing revenue growth of 10.5 per cent with momentum strengthening over the quarter, it said.</p> <p><strong>RELX</strong> said it expects all three of its main business lines to deliver another year of underlying revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in 2021, similar to pre-Covid-19 trends. The information services provider and scientific journal publisher cautioned that the outlook remains uncertain for its exhibitions business, which last year generated 5 per cent of group revenue. </p> <p><strong>AJ Bell</strong>, the investment platform provider, reported that total assets under administration rose 4 per cent to a record £65.2bn in the three months to March. The total customer count grew 11 per cent to 346,797 in the period, it said. </p> <p>Business park developer <strong>Segro </strong>said in a trading update that 2021 has started well with the customer retention rate remaining high at 82 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Domino's&#xa0;Pizza</strong>&#xa0;said the first-quarter has been strong, with “exceptional” trading over the new year period. Franchisee sales in UK and Ireland were up 18.7 per cent year on year to £371.3m, the company reported. </p> <p><strong>Rank Group</strong>, the casino and bingo hall owner, said like-for-like net gaming revenue for the quarter ended March dropped 76 per cent year on year. The group said it expects to continue to meet its banking covenants.</p> <p>Miner <strong>Anglo American</strong> said total first-quarter production rose 3 per cent in spite of Covid-19 measures forcing some operations to run below capacity.</p> <p>Gold miner <strong>Centamin</strong> said first-quarter production from its Sukari&#xa0;mine in Egypt matched 2021 guidance, with the company generating $190m from ore sales at an average of $1,778 per ounce. Sector peer <strong>Polymetal</strong> also reiterated 2021 production targets after posting a 3 per cent year-on-year improvement in gold production to 375,000 ounces. </p> <p><strong>Keywords Studios</strong>, the video games outsourcing agency, announced the purchase of UK-based peer Climax Studios for a total consideration of up to £43m.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Apple</strong> is about to expand its advertising business, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5527ddd1-77a8-4cd0-82fd-4568be5da80f\">according to two people familiar with its plans</a>, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook. The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da9247a7-f6bc-4b6f-994a-fb156d3dea54\">shakes up</a> the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.</p> <p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> is&#xa0;raising SFr1.7bn ($1.9bn) of capital from investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7a958d0-3fc0-456a-9f01-3077b772e41b\">in a bid to rebuild its balance sheet</a> as it reels from&#xa0;back-to-back crises involving Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital&#xa0;that have triggered investigations by&#xa0;the Swiss financial regulator. The Swiss lender said on Thursday it would sell&#xa0;203m convertible notes&#xa0;to&#xa0;existing shareholders&#xa0;as it seeks to lift&#xa0;its common equity tier 1 ratio from 12.2 per cent to 13 per cent.</p> <p>Plans to create a breakaway <strong>European Super League</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3ab9f68-65b2-4839-96b3-ec4d2928053b\">have collapsed</a> after most of the football clubs involved said they would quit the controversial project. Italy's AC Milan and Inter Milan and Atlético Madrid of Spain on Wednesday joined English clubs Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur and withdrew from the breakaway tournament. We have a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfdbbb9-75e4-4374-8214-977a1ddfce68\">profile</a> of Florentino Pérez, president of Real Madrid and the project's mastermind. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c725dc42-6fd1-4bfa-82fc-6d2ed899990b\">Philip Stephens</a> writes on JPMorgan's ill-judged involvement in the fiasco.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>On the back of the extraordinary revelations about David Cameron and Lex Greensill, the Dyson-Johnson text messages emphasise the need for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bad04f4b-a2c2-49e6-9ce7-c8774b55a798\">a proper examination</a> of who has the ear of our political leaders, and how those conversations are handled.</p> <p><strong>Tobias Levkovich</strong> <br>For equity markets, the parallels between current conditions and those of 1999 are striking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eba424d5-185a-4d6c-805d-4a4a9e199f89\">and worrisome</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
