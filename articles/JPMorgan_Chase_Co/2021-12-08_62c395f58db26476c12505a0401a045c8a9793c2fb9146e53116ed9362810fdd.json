  "title": "Turkey's Woes Haven't Spread to Broader Emerging Markets; Foreign investors and benchmark indexes reduced Turkish holdings in recent years",
  "text": "<p>The Turkish lira has plummeted, depreciating 35% against the dollar in the fourth quarter so far. The country's debt sold off with yields on both dollar and lira-denominated bonds rising sharply. Its yield curve is getting increasingly inverted, signaling that the economy's recession is deepening.</p><p>But the rapid deterioration of the country's economic conditions is considered to be an isolated incident driven by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's erratic behavior, investors and analysts said.</p><p>Other major emerging-market currencies have remained relatively stable. Unlike Turkey, most of its peers have raised interest rates this year, drawing in capital from foreign investors. Another factor protecting them: Unlike in the past, emerging-markets investors have shied away from Turkey for some time and so haven't taken a hit from the currency spiral.</p><p>\"One typical way that contagion would play out is that emerging-market investors sell assets in other areas to offset losses. But because they don't have a big exposure to Turkey anymore, there wasn't that forced selling,\" said Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Foreign investors own substantially less Turkish assets than in the past. Government bondholdings of nonresidents have more than halved since the end of 2019, down to $7.8 billion as of Sept. 15 from $16.1 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. For stocks, foreign investors own nearly 40% less since then.</p><p>The steady decline in value of the lira has also eroded Turkish assets' weight in benchmark emerging-market indexes. They make up 1.1% of JPMorgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified bond index, down from 5% at the end of 2018. In the MSCI Emerging Markets stock index, it is 0.2%. That means that passive investors that track benchmarks also hold less Turkish assets.</p><p>Yet overall, there is some disquiet in emerging markets over the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to tighten monetary policy. A broad index of developing-country sovereign bond spreads, a metric of how much extra yield they pay above Treasurys, was recently at the highest level in a year, according to Intercontinental Exchange data.</p><p>The Fed signaled last week that it is preparing to accelerate tapering, which could open the door to raising interest rates sooner. This is likely drawing yield-seeking capital from riskier parts of the world into the U.S., analysts said.</p><p>It has also driven the dollar up, with the WSJ Dollar Index hitting a 15-month high on Nov. 24 and continuing to hover close by. That makes it harder for governments and companies with a lot of dollar debt to repay it, particularly those with weaker economies and balance sheets.</p><p>At the same time, growth is slowing in China, the biggest consumer of commodities that make up a sizable portion of many developing countries' exports. Emerging-market assets may also come under pressure because populations of developing countries tend to be less vaccinated than in the West, elevating the chances of another debilitating wave of Covid-19.</p><p>\"We are going through the worst kind of macro scenario for emerging markets,\" said Gustavo Medeiros, head of research at Ashmore Group.</p><p>There have been net outflows from emerging-market debt funds for the past three consecutive weeks, according to data from EPFR. Equity and currency funds are more mixed, attracting $2.4 billion last week.</p><p>Many emerging-market central banks have learned to be more proactive, which has kept their markets more stable, said Nick Eisinger, head of emerging-market active strategies at Vanguard. \"Often in the past it would be a reaction,\" he said. \"Although you could argue that in this fragile recovery, tightening isn't the ideal situation.\"</p><p>Turkey's central-bank policy is an outlier, but some investors are still trading Turkish assets and hoping for a change of government that would lead to a normalization of economic policy.</p><p>Mr. Eisinger still holds some long-dated Turkish government bonds, betting that shorter-dated bonds take most of the heat if the country's problems accelerate.</p><p>\"It's a trade that's played out well,\" he said. \"The lira will be a tremendous trade if policy becomes more normal. It's definitely cheap, but the risk is still that it could get cheaper.\"</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Turkey's Woes Haven't Spread to Broader Emerging Markets</p>",
