  "title": "OPEC, Russia Agree to Keep Boosting Oil Output, Jolting Prices; OPEC+ had considered pausing production rises as Omicron fueled concerns about demand and the U.S. released stockpiles",
  "text": "<p>The move drove Brent, the international benchmark, and U.S. crude down by about 2%, before prices recovered. In late afternoon European trading, Brent was little changed on the day at about $68.70 a barrel. U.S. crude was trading at about $65.40 a barrel, also little changed from the day before.</p><p>In recent months, the White House has urged OPEC and its allies to increase oil output at a faster rate than they had agreed on. The U.S. led a coordinated release of oil from emergency stockpiles last week, moving to add to supply and reduce oil and gasoline prices. Washington recently said it could make subsequent releases.</p><p>Since then, though, worries over the effect on oil demand from Omicron has sent prices sharply lower. That had OPEC+ debating whether the risk of a new Covid-19 economic slowdown warranted moving more cautiously to add barrels, including halting any new output increase.</p><p>Outside analysts have questioned whether the group can pump as much as it says it will. With production in Russia and many African countries participating in the pact reaching peak levels, the group may only be able to increase output by about 250,000 barrels a day, said Christyan Malek, head of oil-and-gas research at JPMorgan. Most of that will come from OPEC producers in the Persian Gulf, he said. Still, he said, the move \"shows OPEC+'s confidence that the impact of Omicron will be short lived.\"</p><p>Some traders worry Omicron could upend expectations that most of the world is gradually returning to normalcy. Soaring demand amid a fast pandemic recovery in many major economies has sent prices higher. After rising steadily most of this year and through much of November, Brent crude fell sharply after the World Health Organization identified Omicron as a variant of concern. Brent prices ended November down 16%, the weakest month for the commodity since March 2020.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Russia have led OPEC and a group of other oil-producing countries in coordinating output closely amid a demand shock last year caused by the pandemic. The two oil powers mended fences over a price war early last year and convinced partners to cut their collective output sharply—equivalent to almost 10% of the world's demand—to prop up prices. Since then, they have been meeting almost every month to weigh up supply and demand.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, along with other Persian Gulf producers, have come under pressure from the Biden administration to ease oil prices amid accelerating U.S. inflation ahead of midterm elections.</p><p>Before the emergence of the Omicron variant, oil prices had hovered near multiyear highs. OPEC and other forecasting agencies have struggled to predict demand amid the on-again-off-again nature of Covid-19 restrictions. A recent surge in cases in Europe has triggered new restrictions across the continent, while the variant has led to travel bans and restrictions around the world. All that could weigh on economic activity and, by extension, oil demand.</p><p>OPEC's decision with Russia to keep raising production in January added to pressure on oil markets, said John Kilduff, a partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC, who added that he thinks benchmark U.S. crude prices will fall to between $58 to $62 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate futures have already dropped by more than 20% over the past month, knocked first by the release of oil from strategic reserves in the U.S. and other countries as well as the emergence of the Omicron variant.</p><p>\"The supply-demand balance is rapidly shifting in favor of consumers,\" Mr. Kilduff said. He added that average national gasoline prices would likely fall below $3 a gallon within weeks. Now they stand at about $3.38 a gallon, according to AAA.</p><p>Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com</p><p>OPEC, Russia Agree to Keep Boosting Oil Output, Jolting Prices</p>",
