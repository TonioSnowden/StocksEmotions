  "text": "<p>Société Générale chief executive Frédéric Oudéa has said the bank is bracing for a potential hit to its Russian business should the stand-off over the future of Ukraine escalate, but saw no fundamental reason to leave.</p> <p>The French lender is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec5ad958-101c-4185-a56b-09234d2c9d36\">one of the European banks</a> with the biggest operations in Russia, mostly through its Rosbank retail banking subsidiary. It also lends to large Russian companies.</p> <p>“We are getting ready for a scenario where there might be a lower contribution of the business. But it's something that is manageable for the group,” Oudéa told the Financial Times in an interview, adding that the bank was preparing for “all kinds of scenarios”.</p> <p>Its Russian profits are only a small slice of SocGen's total, meaning that the bank would be able to absorb any disruption, Oudéa said. Rosbank accounts for 3 per cent of SocGen's group revenues, according to JPMorgan estimates.</p> <p>Oudéa's effort to reassure investors came as the French lender, which has been revamping its investment bank and reorganising its domestic networks, posted record profits for last year. Profits were helped by charges linked to the coronavirus pandemic falling and business picking up on the back of a Europe-wide economic rebound.</p> <p>However, with Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border, the spotlight has fallen on SocGen's exposure amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts to try and roll back the military build-up.</p> <p>Should some large Russian clients be hit by sanctions, “as we have already done in the past with other sanctions and other clients, we would have to stop the relationship”, Oudéa said.</p> <p>Its Rosbank unit would be able to function autonomously from a liquidity point of view should the situation deteriorate, was well provisioned and had low risk levels, he added. </p> <p>Several banks, including SocGen, have been put on notice by the European Central Bank, which warned lenders with Russian exposure to prepare for the potential imposition of international sanctions in the event Ukraine is invaded.</p> <p>Oudéa said SocGen could reconsider its presence in Russia in the event of a “fundamental breakdown” of its relationship with Europe, but rejected that this was the case. </p> <p>“The basis for us to be there was to consider that Europe and Russia will benefit from the long-term development of an economic relationship — that was the main purpose,” Oudéa said. “[It's] premature to say it's the end of that. Let's see how it goes.”</p> <p>As well as benefiting from a broad economic rebound, SocGen's results for the fourth quarter also capped a turnround year for its investment bank. </p> <p>Its equities business, which was a sore point in 2020 when it was hit by trading losses, outperformed many rivals. In the latest revamp under Oudéa, who has been at the helm since 2008, the investment bank is also shifting more into deal advisory and reining back on riskier products.</p> <p>SocGen is planning to “massively” raise its bonus pool after last year's record performance, investment banking and trading head Slawomir Krupa told Bloomberg TV on Thursday, in the midst of an increasingly fierce war for talent.</p> <p>SocGen's overall net income almost quadrupled to €1.8bn in the three months to December, compared with the same period a year ago. The bank will pay a cash dividend and a share buyback totalling €915mn, hitting its target ratio of returning 50 per cent of profits to shareholders.</p><p>Source:  Sarah White in Paris and Oliver Telling in London 2022 'SocGen braces for potential hit to Russian business after record profits last year' FT.com 10 February.
