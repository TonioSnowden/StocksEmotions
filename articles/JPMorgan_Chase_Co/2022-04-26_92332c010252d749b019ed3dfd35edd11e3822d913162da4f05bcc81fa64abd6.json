  "title": "GE Cautions Outlook Pressured by Supply-Chain Disruptions; Conglomerate posts strong quarterly sales in aviation unit, decline in wind-power business",
  "text": "<p>Executives said on a conference call that they anticipate these pressures to continue into the second quarter. They expect GE's adjusted free cash flow, a key measure of profitability, to be negative in the second quarter but better than the negative $880 million reported in the first quarter.</p><p>\"With respect to supply chain specifically, we know this will be a challenge through the course of the year,\" said Chief Executive Larry Culp in an interview Tuesday. Collectively, supply chain issues,the Russian invasion and China's Covid-19 lockdown cut quarterly revenue growth by 6 percentage points. GE expects improvement from working with suppliers and improved efficiency in its own operations. \"We think that it is less of a challenge as time goes on,\" he said.</p><p>For 2022, GE had projected high-single-digit revenue growth, earnings of $2.80 to $3.50 a share and free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion</p><p>GE shares fell 12% in midday trading Tuesday, hitting a 52-week low. Before the results, the stock had fallen about 17% over the past year, compared with a roughly 2% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>GE, which has slimmed down and streamlined its operations under Mr. Culp, plans to split into three separate public companies over the next two years with its healthcare division expected to spin off in early 2023. The power and renewables business will combine and form a separate company in early 2024.</p><p>The first-quarter results showed how the different parts of the conglomerate are faring in the current climate, with a rebound in air travel boosting one unit and a drop in demand for renewable energy dragging down another.</p><p>Revenue at the aviation division, which makes and services jet engines, rose 12% to $5.6 billion in the first quarter, while segment profit rose to $908 million. It is facing uncertainty in China from recent Covid-19 shutdowns and supply-chain disruption but projects revenue growth of at least 20% for the year.</p><p>GE expects aviation demand to remain strong and Mr. Culp predicted that global flight departures would be at 90% of 2019 levels by the end of this year.</p><p>In the healthcare division, which makes CT scanners, MRI machines and other hospital equipment, revenue rose 1% to $4.4 billion but segment profit dropped 23% to $538 million as supply-chain shortages continue to hit the business.</p><p>Revenue at the power division, which makes and services turbines for gas power plants, fell 11% to $3.5 billion in the first quarter.</p><p>The renewables division, which makes wind turbines, posted a 12% sales drop and an operating loss of $434 million. GE said its U.S. onshore wind business was hurt by policy uncertainty around tax credits and deferred customer investments, while the entire division was hurt by rising prices for materials and logistics.</p><p>In terms of inflation, GE expects that costs will stay ahead of its ability to raise prices for the rest of the year but the gap will get relatively smaller after June.</p><p>\"I think it abates in the second half on a relative basis, less because we think these inflationary pressures subside and more of a function of us doing a better job with our suppliers,\" Mr. Culp said.</p><p>GE also contributed $2 billion to reserves in its defunct insurance business, along with a $200 million impairment charge related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a $200 million charge from a $2.2 billion portfolio of Polish mortgages.</p><p>Overall, GE reported a first-quarter loss attributable to common shareholders of $1.1 billion, narrower than the year-earlier loss of $2.9 billion. Excluding items, GE said its adjusted earnings were 24 cents a share, compared with Wall Street's estimate of 18 cents a share. Revenue was $17.04 billion versus $17.07 billion a year ago. Analysts had projected $16.85 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Citigroup analyst Andrew Kaplowitz, with a \"buy\" rating and $125 price target, said the results show GE is largely on track with its plans, even if the pressures limit gains in the stock price. \"Positive trends in aviation are an encouraging sign that overall earnings/free cash flow recovery trajectory should continue,\" he said.</p><p>JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa, with a \"neutral\" rating and $55 price target, said the results were below expectations on almost all fronts. \"Aviation and power were better but not by enough,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com</p><p>GE Cautions Outlook Pressured by Supply-Chain Disruptions</p>",
