  "title": "JPMorgan Chase and 5 other U.S. mega banks behind a third of the global funding expanding coal, oil and gas; Potential emissions from oil, gas and coal currently in developed fields take the world well past 1.5°C of warming, says Rainforest Action Network",
  "text": "<p>Of that amount, the big six U.S. banks — Bank of AmericaBAC, JPMorgan ChaseJPM, CitiC, Wells FargoWFC, Morgan StanleyMS and Goldman SachsGS — provided 33% to the top 100 coal, oil and gas expanders, funding valued at about $445 billion.</p><p>\"Fossil expansion is a clear litmus-test for assessing the seriousness of banks' net-zero commitments because of the hard but unavoidable carbon math, both on the supply side and the demand side,\" RAN said with its release.</p><p>Net-zero commitments call for the reduction of atmosphere-warming emissions that have lead to deadly drought and more severe storms, costly in lives and economic loss. Banks have made their own net-zero pledges specific to their operations, but advocates want to see more action throughout the financial pipeline.</p><p>And, as RAN and other groups have pointed out, even oil industry groups have said new production must be curtailed to reach emissions milestones.</p><p>\"If governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oilCL00, gasNG00 and coal, from now – from this year.\" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in 2021, surprising the industry with the stark proclamation.</p><p>On the supply side, potential emissions from oil, gas, and coal currently in developed fields — the wells already drilled, the mines already dug, and fossil supplies already coming out of the ground — take the world well past 1.5°C of warming and jeopardize the well-below 2°C limit, RAN says. Those are the temperature targets laid out in the 2015 Paris climate accord.</p><p>If the world ended coal production tomorrow, which is not likely, potential emissions just from the oil and gas fields already in production could exhaust the carbon budget for 1.5°C, RAN aruges.</p><p>This is to say nothing about the much larger quantities of undeveloped reserves that oil, gas, and coal companies already own, RAN added.</p><p>The report and the nearly two-week COP27 conference hit as the world grapples with high inflation and volatile energy markets as Russia's invastion of Ukraine persists. And it hits as a closely contested U.S. midterm election continues to be counted.</p><p>Republican election campaign messaging has included complaints about high gasoline prices and global concerns about the availability of natural gas and the cost of alternatives, such as liquefied natural gas, in the wake of disrupted markets in the months since Russia invaded Ukraine. That messaging dovetails with a GOP argument that the U.S. should pump more of its own energy to avoid the geopolitical stress of relying on Russia and the Middle East.</p><p>Fossil-fuel interests and their mostly Republican backers have pushed for natural gas to remain a fixture in a mixed energy offering that includes wind, solar and other alternatives.</p><p>\"We see the [traditional energy industry] using the Ukraine invasion as an excuse/ We're talking about expansion of facilities that require several years to be up and running and adding to emissions down the road, not any sort of solution to a short-term issue. Reputable energy analysis says their sufficient capacity with LNG to meet the emergency needs in Europe,\" a RAN spokesperson told MarketWatch.</p><p>\"Energy earningsXOM CVX and stock buybacks and dividends contrast with energy shortages that we're saying can be addressed with what are likely profitable investments,\" she added.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase and 5 other U.S. mega banks behind a third of the global funding expanding coal, oil and gas</p>",
