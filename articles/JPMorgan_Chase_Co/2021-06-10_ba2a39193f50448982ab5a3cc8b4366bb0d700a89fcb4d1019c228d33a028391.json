  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs will demand that its US bankers disclose whether or not they have been <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/?areas=gbr&amp;areas=isr&amp;areas=usa&amp;areas=eue&amp;areas=zg7&amp;areas=chn&amp;cumulative=1&amp;doses=total&amp;populationAdjusted=1\">vaccinated against Covid-19</a> ahead of a planned return to the office next week. </p> <p>In a memo sent to staff that was seen by the Financial Times, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a> told employees that responses were required by 12pm US eastern daylight time on Thursday. </p> <p>“Registering your vaccination status allows us to plan for a safer return to the office for all of our people as we continue to abide by local public health measures,” the bank said in the memo.</p> <p>“While we strongly encourage you to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, we understand that the choice to get vaccinated is a personal one,” according to the memo. </p> <p>The disclosure requirement from Goldman is an example of the complexities for employers of ensuring a return to office life following the huge disruption from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus pandemic</a>. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley partnered with Capsule to host an employee-only vaccine clinic in its Times Square headquarters, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p> <p>Goldman is aiming to bring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e515613a-32a2-4692-ad91-0b9e53c577a9\">US staff back to the office</a> on Monday, the Wall Street firm told employees last month. </p> <p>To encourage staff to get vaccinated, Goldman in March began offering employees a half-day of paid time off to get their jabs. </p> <p>Goldman had previously told staff they could voluntarily disclose whether or not they had been vaccinated, and that employees could work in the office without a mask if they had been vaccinated. </p> <p>US banks such as Goldman have opted for a more aggressive return-to-office stance compared with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">gradual approach favoured by European banks</a>. </p> <p>Last month Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase chief executive, launched an impassioned defence of returning to the office, declaring that he was cancelling all future Zoom meetings because he was “done with it”.</p> <p>“We want people back to work, and my view is that sometime in September, October it will look just like it did before,” said the head of JPMorgan, which has told employees they must be back in the office on a rotating basis by next month. </p> <p>Goldman's requirement that employees share their vaccination status is a stricter policy than the ones other Wall Street rivals currently have in place. At JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley the disclosure is still voluntary, according to people briefed on the matter. </p> <p>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in December clarified that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d3c824e-5f9b-4d6e-9cac-56398bbeb498\">companies could bar employees from workplaces</a> if they refused to be vaccinated, subject to religious and medical exemptions.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise in New York 2021 'Goldman Sachs requires US bankers to disclose vaccination status' FT.com 10 June.
