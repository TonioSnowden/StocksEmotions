  "text": "<p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Cineworld misidentifies its largest shareholder</p></li>  <li><p>US dealmakers take Chelsea</p></li>  <li><p>Klarna's losses quadruple</p></li> </ul> <h1>Cineworld's shareholder blooper</h1> <p><strong>Mooky Greidinger </strong>took his family's third-generation cinema business and rode a wave of easy credit to build the world's second-biggest chain of movie theatres.</p> <p>Spoiler alert: this story of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ccd539f-ff48-46ac-8060-74bd11f07241\">debt-fuelled dealmaking</a> at<strong> Cineworld </strong>doesn't have a happy ending. </p> <p>The London-listed cinema chain is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6e37cc7-6383-4183-8abd-3edff46f1037\">preparing for a bankruptcy filing</a> and its Israeli chief executive recently bemoaned that his “life's work collapsed” because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>But the complexity of the structure by which Greidinger and his family built their stake in the cinema group had another consequence. The byzantine nature of their holding companies meant that Cineworld was unable to correctly identify its largest shareholder in its most recent annual report.</p> <p>Let DD explain.</p> <p>In its 2021 annual report, Cineworld reported that 20.08 per cent of its shares were owned by <strong>Global City Holdings</strong>, a Dutch holding company ultimately owned by Greidinger family trusts. </p> <p>A footnote explained that this entity holds 274.7mn shares, while a further 1mn were held by <strong>Global City Theatres</strong>, another Dutch entity that is described as “a wholly owned subsidiary of Global City Holdings”.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d73682bf-a7fc-446e-a2e3-a503fdf56bd0\">some sleuthing</a> from DD's Rob Smith showed that this was wrong. In fact, Global City Theatres is no longer a subsidiary of Global City Holdings, having been transferred 18 months ago to another Greidinger entity called <strong>DKG Park</strong> (fun fact: the initials stand for<strong> Dahlia</strong> and <strong>Kalman Greidinger</strong> — Mooky's parents).</p> <p>As Cineworld has <a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/cineworldplc1/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=655&amp;newsid=1619919\">effectively conceded</a>, it also got the shareholdings of the two entities the wrong way round: in fact Global City Theatres holds 274.7mn of Cineworld shares and Global City Holdings owns 1mn.</p> <p>The real question is how Cineworld — with its cadre of highly paid advisers and lawyers — failed to spot any of this until a journalist flagged it to them. We guess some stories will always remain a mystery.</p> <h1>Made in LA: Chelsea's private equity takeover</h1> <p>When sanctioned Russian oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich </strong>was forced to sell <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong>, there was an awful lot of focus on the downfall of one of the most powerful people in football. Less was said about the buyers.</p> <p>Now, the FT's Samuel Agini has taken an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7385ebc-d657-4116-be0f-96497e5f8d99\">in-depth look</a> at the consortium led by US financier <strong>Todd Boehly </strong>and private equity group <strong>Clearlake Capital </strong>that took control of the west London club for a record $4.25bn.</p> <p>Clearlake, founded by <strong>Behdad Eghbali</strong> and <strong>José Feliciano</strong>, is based in Santa Monica, while Boehly is known for his role in acquiring the <strong>LA Dodgers</strong> baseball team in 2012 for a then-record $2bn.</p> <p>It was a punchy bet, given the Dodgers were in bankruptcy at the time. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Boehly and Eghbali <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChelseaFC/status/1564953709032968193\">posed with their latest acquisition</a>: the £70mn defender <strong>Wesley Fofana</strong>. For those not familiar with English football, clubs spend much of the summer haggling as they seek to buy star players to improve their teams. As interim sporting director, Boehly has taken a keen interest in the phenomenon known as the transfer window (despite his lack of experience in this sector).</p> <p>But Chelsea's net outlay — the difference between players acquired and sold — now tops £200mn. That appetite to spend isn't the departure from the Abramovich years some were expecting.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11008115.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>By taking a look at how Boehly managed the Dodgers can tell us a lot about how Chelsea's new owners plan to make a profit despite the extra-large transfer spending.</p> <p>In that deal, Boehly's consortium realised that away from the ballpark (or baseball field for the non-experts), there was money being left on the table in media rights.</p> <p>The <strong>Major League Baseball </strong>franchise's media rights were coming up for renewal. Some observers predicted they'd go for about $4bn. But competitive tension between broadcasters came into play, and Boehly's crew banked $9bn over 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Forbes</strong> believes the Dodgers are worth $4bn these days, second only to the <strong>New York Yankees</strong>. </p> <p>Boehly and Clearlake are betting on a similar scenario playing out at Chelsea. Their view is that the <strong>English Premier League</strong>, already the world's richest football division, has a way to go in how it monetises its media rights.</p> <p>At the heart of their thesis is that the US <strong>National Football League</strong>'s media revenues are well ahead of the Premier League's. That's despite the US sport playing to a smaller and more domestic audience versus the billions around the world who are captivated by England's elite clubs.</p> <p>So far, however, Boehly and Clearlake are keeping quiet on how exactly they'll work with the Premier League itself and rival clubs on growing the pie for everybody.</p> <h1>Buy now, pay . . . never? </h1> <p>One criticism long levied at buy now, pay later companies has been that they're going to struggle to make money. </p> <p>A company that seemed to defy that was Swedish fintech darling <strong>Klarna</strong>, which for the first 14 years of its existence was profitable. That is no small feat for a start-up. But as of 2019, Klarna has been in the red while it has pursued aggressive expansion. </p> <p>Investors have been undeterred and the business raised money at a whopping $46bn valuation in June last year in a funding round led by none other than <strong>SoftBank</strong>.</p> <p>A year later, Klarna's valuation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66b65d68-d62e-4aec-a1ad-a7d9e2ba0435\">has crashed to below $7bn</a>. On Tuesday it reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/483451db-9221-4ca4-83a6-b4ddc6bfcfbb\">that losses had quadrupled</a>. </p> <p>The payments company reported a net loss of SKr6.2bn ($581mn) for the first half of 2022, compared with SKr1.4bn a year earlier. It said the losses were down to higher employee costs, rising credit losses and its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2325973-dd9b-4c08-beef-460c5fcca933\">acquisition</a> of <strong>PriceRunner</strong>. </p> <p>Klarna's aim now is to get back to profitability, said chief executive and co-founder <strong>Sebastian Siemiatkowski</strong>. That's easier said than done amid a cost of living crisis that will probably increase defaults and limit the amount of customers using its product. </p> <p>Meanwhile, rising interest rates will make it more expensive for Klarna to borrow cash to fund its growth and a regulatory crackdown could add further costs to its business. </p> <p>“Klarna has been operating in a very different environment in the first half of 2022,” Siemiatkowski said. Yeah, no kidding. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bank of America</strong> has made four senior hires on its ESG team: <strong>Alexandra Basirov </strong>in London from <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>, <strong>Andrew Stinson</strong> in Charlotte from BofA's Global Corporate Banking, and<strong> Emily Laochua </strong>and <strong>Suley Saleem</strong> in New York from<strong> Credit Suisse Securities </strong>and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s<strong> Calvert Research and Management</strong>, respectively.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Snap</strong>'s chief business officer <strong>Jeremi Gorman </strong>and ad executive <strong>Peter Naylor</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59134aaa-6ae2-4940-86ab-bf6e2fdc41bd\">are leaving</a> the social media company to lead <strong>Netflix</strong>'s advertising business.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/deutsche-bank-appoints-matthew-raskin-head-us-rates-research-memo-2022-08-29/\">has named</a> New York Fed economist and policy adviser <strong>Matthew Raskin</strong> as a managing director and US head of rates research, per Reuters.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Loyal to a fault </strong>GameStop chair Ryan Cohen has inspired a devout online following of retail traders who idolise his portfolio.
