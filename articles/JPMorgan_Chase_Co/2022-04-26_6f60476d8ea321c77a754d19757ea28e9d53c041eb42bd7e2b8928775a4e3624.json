  "title": "GM's First-Quarter Net Income Down 3%, Reaffirms Year-End Guidance; Higher vehicle prices are helping to offset mounting challenges for the Detroit auto maker",
  "text": "<p>General Motors Co.'s first-quarter profit slipped 3% from a year earlier and the auto maker stood by its 2022 earnings forecast, reflecting strong pricing power that continues to offset mounting challenges.</p><p>GM on Tuesday posted $2.9 billion in net income for the January-to-March period, bolstered by strong sales of trucks and sport-utility vehicles.</p><p>Pretax profit, adjusted for nonrecurring items, fell 8%, to about $4 billion. That amounted to $2.09 per share, better than the average analysts' forecast of $1.65, according to research firm FactSet.</p><p>The operating landscape for car companies has gotten choppier since January, when GM issued an upbeat outlook for 2022.</p><p>Company executives said at the time they expected pretax income, minus one-time items, to be $13 billion to $15 billion this year, a forecast that assumed no new economic shocks or supply-chain pressures beyond lingering effects from the chip shortage. Its pretax income was $14.3 billion last year.</p><p>Inflationary pressures on auto makers and suppliers have worsened in the two months since the Ukraine war began. Logistical delays, higher freight costs and rising prices for raw materials such as nickel and lithium, key ingredients for electric-vehicle battery cells, are weighing on auto manufacturers, analysts and executives say.</p><p>Meanwhile, Covid-19 restrictions in China ratcheted up toward the end of the first quarter and continue, potentially adding further stress on the automotive supply chain.</p><p>Car companies are likely to pass along to consumers the added costs of those disruptions, which could erode demand for new vehicles, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a research note last month.</p><p>Continued supply-chain troubles will suppress global vehicle sales this year, said S&amp;P Global Mobility, which tracks auto-industry data. The research firm last week cut its closely watched forecast of global vehicle production for the second time since the Ukraine war began. It now expects 80.6 million vehicles to be produced this year, down about 4% from its initial forecast.</p><p>Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com</p><p>GM's First-Quarter Net Income Down 3%, Reaffirms Year-End Guidance</p>",
