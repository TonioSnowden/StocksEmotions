  "title": "Banks Now Have a $2 Trillion Worry",
  "text": "<p>The overnight reverse repurchase agreement, or reverse repo, facility let the Fed sop up excess liquidity from the economy by giving banks or big money managers a way to park cash and earn a return. Daily transactions in the facility hit $2 trillion last week and stayed around that level, up from about $1.5 trillion at the beginning of 2022.</p><p>From a stock investor's view, what may be most notable about that money is where it isn't: with banks and money-market funds. Bank deposits fell slightly from the week ended Dec. 29 through mid-May, according to the latest Fed figures. And money-market-fund assets fell about 4% since the end of last year, according to Investment Company Institute figures.</p><p>According to the Fed's recent minutes, one driver of rising reverse repo facility usage was declining Treasury-bill supply set against increased demand. One-month U.S. Treasury bills are yielding about 0.75%, below the reverse repo facility's 0.8% rate. The expectation in the minutes is that reverse repo usage \"could remain elevated in coming months.\"</p><p>For some big banks, letting deposits go elsewhere may be a necessary release valve. Global U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced pressure on their capital ratios from a flood of deposits onto their balance sheets, which can lead to lower returns on equity or smaller stock buybacks. So some deposits are essentially unwanted, and banks don't need to offer higher rates to hold them. Shedding certain noncore deposits could help the bank \"serve clients in bad times,\" Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said at a Bernstein conference on Wednesday.</p><p>For banks that don't have an excess of deposit funding, or that have primarily \"flighty\" institutional deposits that very actively seek out the best rate, a flow of money away from banks could force them to compete more quickly for deposits than they might have anticipated.</p><p>In 2022, the bottom quartile of banks for deposit growth lost an average of 10% of their commercial deposits from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, versus a 2% rise for the top quartile, according to Curinos. \"The asymmetric impact across banks will accelerate the return to rate competition,\" Curinos said in a recent note.</p><p>Even the banks that don't need to compete now might need to soon. Barclays strategist Joseph Abate estimates there is about $1.5 trillion of excess \"surge\" deposits at U.S. banks from the pandemic. Given the anticipated pace of interest rate increases and the Federal Reserve's portfolio reduction, Mr. Abate expects money-market flows to increase this summer, and fiercer competition for deposits to increase later next year.</p><p>The degree of competition may depend on the economy. Morgan Stanley bank analysts on Monday noted a decline in cash balances for banks so far this year amid rising loan growth and other demands. \"The challenge is that [quantitative tightening] will accelerate this decline in bank cash,\" they wrote. Without raising deposit rates or borrowing more from capital markets, banks' alternative would be to slow loan growth. \"Hang on, as the ride could get rocky,\" the analysts wrote.</p><p>Some reverse repo money may start to move back to banks as deposit rates rise, relieving some of the pressure, or the Fed could tweak the terms of the facility. But the current direction of things might serve a key purpose. Rates strategists at Bank of America noted banks may seek to offset rising deposit costs by increasing lending rates for borrowers, and the Fed may welcome these tighter lending conditions \"since it helps slow the economy\" and would \"lean against inflation.\" That might sound like good news for inflation hawks. But bank investors are birds of a different feather.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
