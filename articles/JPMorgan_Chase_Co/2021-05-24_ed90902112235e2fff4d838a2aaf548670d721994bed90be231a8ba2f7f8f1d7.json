  "text": "<p>The latest deal in a wave of US energy consolidation was announced on Monday, with shale oil producer Cimarex Energy and Cabot Oil &amp; Gas revealing a “merger of equals” that will create a group with an enterprise value of $17bn.</p> <p>The combination brings together Cimarex's oil assets in the prolific Permian shale field of West Texas and New Mexico, and Cabot's acreage in north-east Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale, the biggest US gasfield.</p> <p>“This transformational merger will combine our top-tier assets and advance our shared focus on delivering superior returns for investors,” said Thomas Jorden, Cimarex chief executive.</p> <p>Dan Dinges, Cabot chief executive, said the deal would “create a free cash flow focused, diversified energy company with the scale, inventory and financial strength to thrive across commodity price cycles”.</p> <p>The combined debt of the two companies is about $3.3bn, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, while they each had a market capitalisation of roughly $7.1bn before the deal was announced. </p> <p>The merger is the latest in a string of deals struck in recent months as the US oil patch recovers from last year's pandemic-induced crude-price rout, which bankrupted scores of oil companies and sent years of US crude production growth into reverse.</p> <p>Since the start of the fourth quarter last year, about $50bn worth of deals have been struck. Last month Pioneer Natural Resources bought <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94f1fdc9-6b1d-45cf-b804-46cb58cc6bb0\">private equity-backed</a> DoublePoint Energy in a $6.4bn all-stock deal and EQT Corporation, another Marcellus gas producer, said it was buying Alta Resources for almost $3bn. </p> <p>Executives in the US shale sector, out of favour on Wall Street after years of profligate spending, debt-fuelled drilling and deep losses, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8d72d4d-09b1-47fb-bb6c-3c314770f1c1\">have promised</a> they will now prioritise shareholder returns and profitability over new supply increases. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c803be61-61ac-4f4c-836a-4ac19265ad45\">pledge has mostly held</a>, with producers eschewing a new drilling surge despite a recovery in oil prices, instead using the windfall to repair balance sheets, reduce liabilities and return capital. Mergers have mostly been completed using equity, not cash. </p> <p>Analysts said the focus of the dealmaking remains on cash flow, a trend helped by a 70 per cent rise in US oil prices since November.</p> <p>“This is the kind of consolidation big investors are looking for,” said Andrew Gillick, managing director and energy sector strategist at consultancy Enverus. Cabot was a prize for Cimarex, he suggested, offering “stable production, cost cuts and a cash flow machine”.</p> <p>Cabot had been a much-rumoured target for months.</p> <p>Cimarex and Cabot said the combined company would deliver cumulative free cash flow of $4.7bn between 2022 and 2024 at roughly current oil and gas prices. The new company could supplement a $0.50 annual dividend with a variable payout equivalent to at least half of quarterly cash flow, they said. </p> <p>Cimarex shareholders will receive just over four shares of Cabot stock for each share in Cimarex. They will hold 50.5 per cent of the new company on a diluted basis. The companies said the deal was expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p> <p>The new company, which is yet to be named, will be based in Houston. JPMorgan and law firm Baker Botts are advising Cabot. Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Company and law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz are advising Cimarex.</p><p>Source: Derek Brower, US energy editor 2021 'Latest US energy merger creates $17bn oil and gas group' FT.com 24 May.
