  "text": "<p>Mr. Aguzin is an Argentine national who also holds a Croatian passport and has permanent residence in Hong Kong. He doesn't speak Mandarin -- unlike his Beijing-born predecessor Charles Li, who led HKEX from 2010 to the end of last year.</p><p>The appointment of a foreigner underscores the exchange's global ambitions and its independence, amid concerns about Beijing's growing influence on the city, said Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd.</p><p>\"It helps strengthen the image of Hong Kong as an international financial center,\" said Mr. Pong.</p><p>He said Mr. Aguzin's strengths would be complemented by those of HKEX Chairman Laura Cha, who has strong connections in mainland China as a former vice chairman of China's securities watchdog.</p><p>HKEX said Mr. Aguzin was appointed to a three-year term, effective May 24. He takes over from Calvin Tai, who had been interim CEO after Mr. Li, also a former JPMorgan banker, stepped down.</p><p>HKEX has benefited from a rush of capital-raising by Chinese technology startups and U.S.-listed Chinese companies seeking a secondary listing in the city. Trading turnover has also surged, thanks in part to growing inflows from mainland Chinese investors. HKEX shares have risen 92% in the past 12 months, according to S&amp;P.</p>",
