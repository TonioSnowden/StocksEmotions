  "title": "U.S. News: Barr Confirmed as Top Banking Regulator",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Barr won bipartisan support for the regulatory role, which has a four-year term. The vote was 66-to-28, surpassing the 50 votes needed for confirmation. Earlier on Wednesday, senators confirmed Mr. Barr to a 10-year term on the Fed's governing board.</p><p>A dean of public policy at the University of Michigan, Mr. Barr is the last of Mr. Biden's slate of five appointees to the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and three other appointments were confirmed in recent months.</p><p>The supervision role that Mr. Barr is set to fill is responsible for developing a broad vision for the regulation of big banks and other financial firms. That includes developing policy recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Randal Quarles, who previously held the Fed supervision post, focused on simplifying financial regulations enacted after the 2008-09 financial crisis, moves that supporters have said clarified or better calibrated the central bank's rules but that some Democrats said significantly softened the impact of the Wall Street rulebook. Mr. Quarles left the Fed in December.</p><p>Mr. Barr is expected to weigh in on a Biden administration push to review the way regulators assess the mergers of large banks, a process in its early stages that could make bank tie-ups more difficult.</p><p>Friends and former colleagues said that if Mr. Barr does try to change direction at the Fed, they expect he would take a collaborative and pragmatic approach. An academic known for his work on financial inclusion and consumer advocacy, Mr. Barr had stints in the Treasury Department during the Clinton and Obama administrations, including as a top lieutenant to then Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Mr. Barr played a role as an architect of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.</p><p>Analysts said they expect Mr. Barr would likely pursue relatively modest steps to strengthen bank stress tests rather than wholesale revisions to the annual exercise to test whether large lenders are able to withstand a severe recession. Stress test results now feed into banks' capital requirements for the ensuing year.</p><p>Mr. Barr said at a May hearing that he wanted to get a broad view of various bank-capital and liquidity requirements before pushing for adjustments to specific rules.</p><p>Brandon Barford, a partner at research firm Beacon Policy Advisors, said Mr. Barr will have to navigate the bank-merger issue by working with the Democratic heads of other agencies, notably at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., who have called for tougher merger guidelines. Mr. Barr's views on the matter weren't made clear in his confirmation hearing.</p><p>\"I think it will be a pretty big fight as Barr looks to protect the Fed's prerogative over mergers, but also has to work with other regulators who have proved they are not afraid to break norms in order to try to push regulation further left,\" Mr. Barford said.</p><p>Mr. Barr's confirmation is a victory for the Biden administration after multiple regulatory nominees failed to gain traction in the evenly divided Senate.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
