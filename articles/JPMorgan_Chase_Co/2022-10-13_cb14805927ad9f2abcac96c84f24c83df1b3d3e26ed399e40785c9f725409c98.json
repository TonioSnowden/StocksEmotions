  "title": "Stocks Fall on Fed Minutes, PPI  ---  S&P 500 closes at  lowest level in nearly  two years as investors  show edginess  ----  By Chelsey Dulaney and Paul Vigna",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks slipped on new inflation data and the release of the minutes of the September meeting of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting board. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 edged down 11.81 points, or 0.3%, to 3577.03, a nearly two-year low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 28.34 points, or 0.1%, closing at 29210.85. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.09 points, or 0.1%, to 10417.10, a day after the tech-heavy index entered its second bear market of 2022, marking a drop of more than 20% from its recent high on Aug. 15. </p><p>   Investors have been on edge this week ahead of the release of Thursday's report on consumer prices in the U.S. that will shed light on how much work the Fed has left to do in containing decades-high price rises. In recent months, inflation gauges have shown widespread pricing pressures on categories like food and housing, while energy prices have eased. </p><p>   U.S. suppliers increased the prices they charge customers by 0.4% in September from a month earlier, according to data released Wednesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.2% increase. </p><p>   \"Inflation certainly broadened out and entered into areas that were more sticky,\" said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS. \"That's why there's been an increase in expectations. . .that the Fed needs to keep rates at a higher level for longer to get inflation down.\" </p><p>   The Fed released Wednesday afternoon the minutes of its September meeting, which showed officials concerned over the persistence of high inflation and expecting that bringing prices and wages down would likely require the labor market to weaken. </p><p>   The Fed's stance has heightened the risk of a recession, but it doesn't appear the economy is in one now, said Merk Investments strategist Nicholas Reece. A recession may in fact come as late as the second half of next year, he said. That, however, likely means the market may churn along for several more months before finally hitting a cycle low. \"That's one of the things hanging over this market,\" he said. </p><p>   Corporate earnings over the next several weeks will also provide insight into how businesses are dealing with price pressures. PepsiCo on Wednesday again lifted its sales outlook for the year as it continues to push through price increases on its snacks and drinks, sending shares up $6.80, or 4.2%, to $169.39. </p><p>   The coming days will bring updates from a range of companies, including Delta Air Lines and banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. </p><p>   Mr. Ganesh said earnings estimates for the remainder of the year and 2023 are too optimistic, posing another risk for stocks. </p><p>   \"If you look at market performance so far this year, it's pretty much fully explained by the move in rates and bond yields,\" said Mr. Ganesh. \"Higher rates should mean lower expectations for growth and earnings, and that's not priced into the market yet.\" </p><p>   Investors also continue to watch turmoil in U.K. government-bond markets, which have been highly volatile since the government set plans for large, debt-funded tax cuts last month. </p><p>   The pound rebounded 1.2% to $1.1102 in New York. But U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, remained under pressure. The 30-year U.K. gilt yield briefly topped 5%, a level last seen before the central bank's intervention. Yields rise as prices fall. </p><p>   The U.S. 10-year Treasury note was down slightly at 3.901%. </p><p>   \"Bond markets think the BOE isn't doing enough,\" said Viraj Patel, a global macro strategist at Vanda Research. Despite the BOE's pledge to wind down bond buying, Mr. Patel said he still believes the central bank would step in with support if volatility again threatens financial stability. </p><p>   \"They won't let this get to some sort of chaos that spirals out of control,\" he said. </p><p>   The U.K.'s FTSE 100 fell 0.9% to 6826.15, while the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.5% to 385.88. </p><p>   Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.2%, South Korea's Kospi was down 1.1% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.3%. </p><p></p>",
