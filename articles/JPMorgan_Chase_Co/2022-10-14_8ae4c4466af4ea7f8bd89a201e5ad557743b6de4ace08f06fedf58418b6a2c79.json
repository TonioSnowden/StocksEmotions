  "text": "<p>Then something unexpected happened. Stocks surged to finish the day higher. Thursday marked the first time the Dow industrials both fell at least 500 points and rose at least 800 points in a single trading day, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Outsize moves both to the upside and downside show just how jittery investors have gotten this year. Inflation has remained uncomfortably high, despite the Fed raising rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s. Economic growth is also slowing. That has made many investors build up bets against the marketâ€”which they have then sometimes, as in Thursday's case, abruptly unwound.</p><p>\"The conditions were ripe for a counterintuitive move, since we often see something like this when positioning is one-sided,\" Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research, said in an email.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 shed 86.84 points, or 2.4%, to 3583.07 and finished the week with a 1.6% loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 403.89 points, or 1.3%, to 29634.83 and rose 1.2% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite declined 327.76 points, or 3.1%, to 10321.39 and slipped 3.1% for the week.</p><p>Stocks fell broadly Friday, with all 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 posting losses. The materials and consumer-discretionary groups were among the biggest decliners.</p><p>Bank stocks were mixed after large lenders reported profits dropping in the third quarter. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index fell 1.4%.</p><p>Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained $1.82, or 1.7%, to $111.19. The bank's revenue rose more than expected thanks to solid consumer spending, higher interest rates and strong performance on its trading desks.</p><p>Wells Fargo rose 79 cents, or 1.9%, to $43.17 after delivering stronger-than expected revenue, in part because of a jump in its net interest income.</p><p>Morgan Stanley bucked the trend. Its shares fell $4.02, or 5.1%, to $75.30 after the bank missed analysts' expectations for both earnings and revenue.</p><p>In the bond market Friday, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 4.005%, from 3.952% Thursday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Elsewhere, U.K. stocks and government bonds, or gilts, rose after Prime Minister Liz Truss fired Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng, just weeks after he presented the largest tax cuts in a generation.</p><p>The U.K.'s benchmark FTSE 100 rallied but finished up just 0.1% after paring most of its gains.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.6%. In Asia, China's Shanghai Composite climbed 1.8% while Japan's Nikkei 225 added 3.3%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Drop After Wild Surge on Wall Street</p>",
