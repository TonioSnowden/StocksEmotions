  "title": "Feds investigating Activision options trade that paid off big for Diller, Geffen, von Furstenberg",
  "text": "<p>The three men have an unrealized profit of about $60 million on the options trade, based on the recent Activision share price of around $80, according to the people.</p><p>Diller, von Furstenberg and Geffen bought options to purchase Activision shares at $40 each on Jan. 14 in privately arranged transactions through&#xa0;JPMorgan Chase&#xa0;&amp; Co. JPM, the people said. Activision shares were trading around $63 at the time, meaning the options were already profitable to exercise, or “in the money.” Option holders could reap more if Activision's stock price rose.</p><p>The Justice Department is investigating whether any of the options trades violated insider-trading laws, the people familiar with the matter said. The Securities and Exchange Commission is separately conducting a civil insider-trading investigation, the people said.</p><p>Diller said in an interview that none of the men had material nonpublic information about the&#xa0;Microsoft-Activision deal. He confirmed they had been contacted by regulators. “It was simply a lucky bet,” he said. “We acted on no information of any kind from anyone. It is one of those coincidences.”</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>How much oil does the U.S. import from Russia and why is Biden banning it?</p><p>Hundreds of ships trapped by Ukraine war, endangering sailors and global trade.</p>",
