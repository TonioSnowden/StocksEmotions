He sued the magazine for a billion dollars in damages. The suit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/18/business/the-media-business-investor-settles-libel-suit-against-business-week.html\">didn't last long.</a></p> <p>Whether or not his glory days were behind him was subject to debate. The stunning 80 per cent gross gains Tiger logged in 1993 were followed by a few rocky years. But by the time Robertson exited the game altogether in 2000, investors received annual returns of more than 25 per cent net of fees.</p> <p>What's certain is that his legacy has lived on long after the fund closed up shop, as his protégés turned his seed capital into their own multibillion-dollar empires.&#xa0;</p> <p>Close to 200 firms can trace their roots back to Tiger, according to<strong> LCH Investments</strong>. Only his fellow hedge fund investor <strong>George Soros</strong> comes close to having helped launch so many key players.</p> <p>No one illustrates the prestige of the “Tiger Club” pedigree quite like <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>, whose status as a Robertson disciple gained him access to the heaps of leverage that would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c480d5c0-ccf7-41de-8f56-03686a4556b6\">ultimately become his downfall</a>. Others, such as <strong>Tiger Global</strong>'s <strong>Chase Coleman</strong>, have had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11834bc1-f9b3-43a8-b142-7e890d85a11e\">better luck</a>.</p> <p>But what places Tiger's sabre-toothed cubs (Hwang excluded) such a cut above the rest that the name carries so much weight?</p> <p>The better question is <em>who</em>. Enter <strong>Dr Aaron Stern</strong>, the Freudian-trained psychoanalyst one insider <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1d1c558-9a87-4843-9cd8-29ab203b7911\">described to</a> the FT's Laurence Fletcher and Harriet Agnew as “Julian's horse-whisperer”.</p> <p>Stern joined Tiger in 1991, bringing with him the same sort of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/arts/aaron-stern-dead.html\">feather-ruffling tenacity</a> he was notorious for as head of Hollywood's rating board in the 1970s.&#xa0;</p> <p>Though his methods were unconventional — aspiring young analysts would endure 450-question exams, Rorschach inkblots and other psychological tests to peer inside their minds — they worked. And before long, Stern had wielded significant power over Robertson and the firm.</p> <p>“We try to assimilate in these people [young analysts] the qualities that made Julian Julian,'‘ he is quoted saying in the Businessweek piece from 1996.</p> <p>Stern, who died in April at the age of 96, was a leading expert in narcissistic personality disorder. “It is unfortunate that we have such a great fear of failure, because it is success that is far more dangerous to the human condition,” he wrote in his book <em>ME: The Narcissistic American</em>.</p> <h2>The Spac that sparked a Sparc</h2> <p>After <strong>Bill Ackman</strong> pulled off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b4a74a4-5c60-4181-abb9-b1f2baaca576\">the largest blank-cheque listing </a>to date in July last year, he promised investors an equally impressive deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>But that was at the height of the boom in special purpose acquisition companies. As DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/690a77a8-bbee-446c-9b22-e5279f3bb143\">has told you</a>, things have soured significantly since then.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, hopes were high that Ackman, one of the most well-known figures on Wall Street, would bring the big merger that would reinvigorate the Spac market. On Friday those hopes were dashed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ackman, whose Spac <strong>Pershing Square Tontine Holdings</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b4a74a4-5c60-4181-abb9-b1f2baaca576\">raised</a> a whopping $4bn, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210603006167/en/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-Provides-Update-to-Investors\">announced a three-part transaction</a> that left a lot of people confused.&#xa0;</p> <p>Buckle up because this deal gets complicated.&#xa0;</p> <p>First, the billionaire investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ca220cd-d516-4ad7-a73c-748f6de025d2\">said</a> that he would use the cash in the Spac to acquire a 10 per cent stake in <strong>Universal Music Group</strong>, the company behind artists such as <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> and <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But, unlike other Spac deals, Universal would not go public through the transaction. Think of it as akin to a Pipe deal (known as a private investment in a public equity) where investors get to buy in early in a company that will eventually list.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then investors will also get two more opportunities to invest in future Ackman-led deals — one through the existing PSTH structure and the other through a special purpose acquisition rights company, an Ackman creation referred to as a Sparc.</p> <p>You can't fault Ackman for his ingenuity. The transaction, though complicated, frees him from time constraints inherent in Spacs — remember they have two years to strike a deal — because neither will operate as one.&#xa0;</p> <p>PSTH will have up to $2.9bn in its pot of cash to find a company to take public but investors will no longer have redemption rights or warrants. Meanwhile, the Sparc will list on the New York Stock Exchange but unlike a Spac, it won't raise money before finding a target, and there's no obligation on PSTH investors to exercise the option.&#xa0;</p> <p>If they choose to do so, they'll pay $20 a share.&#xa0;</p> <p>While the transaction has received mixed reviews from investors, the Sparc has been an unexpected hit.&#xa0;</p> <p>“This structure makes far more sense,” said <strong>Shivaram Rajgopal</strong>. “I think this is Spac 2.0.”</p> <h2>SoftBank's second-ever female director prepares to enter the boardroom</h2> <p>Anyone who follows<strong> SoftBank</strong>'s <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> and his sprawling Japanese company knows there's one thing the billionaire entrepreneur has never taken seriously: corporate governance.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD has been told that stories abound of frustrated board directors coming and going, complaining that Son simply doesn't listen to their advice. So it's no surprise that for his latest management refresh, he has turned to an old friend.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Keiko Erikawa</strong>, chair of Japanese video game developer <strong>Koei Tecmo</strong>, has known Son since he founded SoftBank in 1981. Now, she'll work with him directly for the first time as a rare female board member at the company.&#xa0;</p> <p>“At first, I told him our company was also looking for female management and that I didn't have time . . . But I thought it might be fun and accepted,” Erikawa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afe53dbf-1c63-487d-8cab-4a1ca338deab\">told</a> the FT's Kana Inagaki.&#xa0;</p> <p>She added that she knows his personality well: “He won't be satisfied until [SoftBank becomes] the world's number one as an investment company.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Known for speaking her mind and exhibiting a different management style to Son's, she'll likely offer a new perspective to Son's signature <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f78abc14-abd0-427d-9e44-e5e593104432\">high-risk approach</a>. (SoftBank's only other female director <strong>Yuko Kawamoto</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d6d6593-78e2-49d1-9477-7227725b8e98\">stepped down last</a> month after openly challenging Son on issues of internal control.)</p> <p>Pending shareholder approval, her first challenge at SoftBank may have already arrived.</p> <p><strong>Katerra</strong>, the US construction start-up backed by SoftBank's Vision Fund, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a70b6130-b062-4850-8759-4a10a5a26f3d?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">filed for bankruptcy</a> following the collapse of its former lender <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>GoTo</strong> has named <strong>Jacky Lo </strong>as its chief financial officer. Lo, who served as CFO for <strong>OneConnect</strong> and <strong>Yum China</strong>, joins as the company prepares for a dual listing in New York and Jakarta after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce944c28-a6d1-42b9-9da2-12e90cb2ae19\">merger</a> of Indonesian start-ups<strong> Gojek</strong> and <strong>Tokopedia</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> has named <strong>Aradhana Sarin</strong> as its next CFO following its takeover of <strong>Alexion Pharma</strong>, where she held the same role. She replaces <strong>Marc Dunoyer</strong>, who will step down from the role after more than seven years and retire from the board.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>HSBC</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b31e23ac-33d3-48fe-9537-90c0cd91f76d\">will split</a> its top leadership role in Asia between China and the rest of the continent, replacing Asia chief executive <strong>Peter Wong</strong> with <strong>David Liao</strong>, who will oversee its China strategy, and <strong>Surendra Rosha</strong>, who will manage the rest of the region.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has hired <strong>Bob Elfring</strong> as vice-chair of Emea investment banking in London. Elfring was previously a senior banker at <strong>Bank of America</strong> and has spent most of his career between London and Amsterdam.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> has hired<strong> Luigi Rizzo</strong> as vice-chair of investment banking for Emea. Rizzo was until 2019 in a senior M&amp;A role at <strong>Bank of America</strong>, where he joined after leaving Goldman Sachs where he was a partner.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Food fight</strong> Greggs and Pret A Manger have long dominated the lunch rush in the City, coexisting as they catered to different crowds. Now, a smaller pool of post-pandemic customers has heightened the competition.
