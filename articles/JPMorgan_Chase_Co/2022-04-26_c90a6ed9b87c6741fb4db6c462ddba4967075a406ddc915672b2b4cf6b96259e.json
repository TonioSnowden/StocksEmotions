  "title": "GM Posts 3% Drop in First-Quarter Net Income, Reaffirms Upbeat 2022 Outlook; Higher vehicle prices are helping to offset mounting challenges for the Detroit auto maker",
  "text": "<p>General Motors Co.'s first-quarter profit slipped 3% from a year earlier and the auto maker stood by its 2022 earnings forecast, reflecting strong pricing power that continues to offset mounting challenges.</p><p>GM on Tuesday posted $2.9 billion in net income for the January-to-March period, bolstered by strong sales of trucks and sport-utility vehicles.</p><p>Pretax profit, adjusted for nonrecurring items, fell 8%, to about $4 billion. That amounted to $2.09 a share, better than the average analysts' forecast of $1.65, according to research firm FactSet.</p><p>The operating landscape for car companies has gotten choppier since January, when GM issued an upbeat outlook for 2022. Company executives said at the time they expected pretax income, minus one-time items, to be $13 billion to $15 billion this year, a forecast that assumed no new economic shocks or supply-chain pressures beyond lingering effects from the chip shortage. Its pretax income was $14.3 billion last year.</p><p>Inflationary pressures on auto makers and suppliers have worsened in the two months since the Ukraine war began. Logistical delays, higher freight costs and rising prices for raw materials such as nickel and lithium, key ingredients for electric-vehicle battery cells, are weighing on auto makers, analysts and executives say. Meanwhile, Covid-19 restrictions in China ratcheted up toward the end of the first quarter and continue, potentially adding further stress on the automotive supply chain.</p><p>GM said it continued to get a big lift from strong pricing. Dealer stocks have been so thin amid constrained computer-chip supplies that GM and other auto makers have pulled way back on financial incentives for consumers, who have been paying record sums for new vehicles.</p><p>Still, GM said higher commodity and logistics costs had more of a negative effect on the bottom line than in recent quarters, largely offsetting the effects of strong pricing.</p><p>Car companies are likely to pass along to consumers the added costs of those disruptions, which could erode demand for new vehicles, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a research note last month.</p><p>Continued supply-chain troubles will suppress global vehicle sales this year, said S&amp;P Global Mobility, which tracks auto-industry data. The research firm last week cut its closely watched forecast of global vehicle production for the second time since the Ukraine war began. It now expects 80.6 million vehicles to be produced this year, down about 4% from its initial forecast.</p><p>GM shares have suffered amid the macroeconomic pressures, falling about 32% this year through Monday's close, compared with a 10% drop for the S&amp;P 500. Shares of Ford Motor Co., which reports first-quarter results Wednesday, were down 27%.</p><p>Still, GM during the first quarter fared better than some rivals on keeping its plants running in North America, by far its biggest profit generator.</p><p>GM scrapped about 50,000 vehicles of planned production because of the chip shortage during the three-month period, which was roughly half the total cut by rival Ford, according to data from research firm AutoForecast Solutions. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. also were harder hit by chip-related factory disruptions, AutoForecast estimates show.</p><p>GM executives said early this year that they expected the semiconductor shortage to gradually improve this year. Problems already have spilled into the second quarter, as GM canceled work during the first two weeks of April at its Fort Wayne, Ind., plant, one of four factories that make full-size pickup trucks, GM's biggest moneymakers.</p><p>GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the availability of computer chips improved in the first quarter relative to the last half of 2021. She said GM still expects gradual easing of the shortage and reiterated the company's target from earlier in the year of boosting vehicle deliveries by 25% to 30% this year over last.</p><p>Despite the turbulent operating climate, GM and other auto makers are eager to show investors that they can seize the growth opportunity in electric vehicles. GM on Monday confirmed plans for an electric Corvette sports car, one day ahead of a Ford event tomark the start of production of its F-150 Lightning pickup truck.</p><p>Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com</p><p>GM Posts 3% Drop in First-Quarter Net Income, Reaffirms Upbeat 2022 Outlook</p>",
