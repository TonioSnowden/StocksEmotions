  "title": "JPMorgan to Acquire Owner  Of Zagat Restaurant Guide  ----  By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Benjamin Mullin",
  "text": "<p>   America's biggest bank is buying the company behind the Zagat brand. </p><p>   JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said on Thursday that it has reached a deal to acquire the Infatuation, which owns websites and apps that guide diners to eat like locals in cities around the world. </p><p>   The company also hosts a biannual food festival, Eeeeeatscon, where restaurants serve food in a stadium while musicians and speakers entertain attendees. </p><p>   JPMorgan is buying all of the Infatuation's business, including the decadesold restaurant brand Zagat. </p><p>   The Infatuation purchased Zagat from Alphabet Inc.'s Google for an undisclosed amount in 2018, the same year it raised $30 million from WndrCo, a technology and media investment firm co-founded by Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg. </p><p>   Banks don't usually buy media companies. But JPMorgan has made a push to attract big spenders who like to travel and dine out, particularly through credit-card rewards. Last year, the bank rolled out Chase Dining in its Ultimate Rewards portal, which gives certain cardholders access to hard-to-get dining reservations and other perks. </p><p>   Sapphire Reserve and Preferred cardholders get access to virtual events with chefs, mixologists and restaurateurs. </p><p>   Founded in 2009 by record executives Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, the Infatuation has grown from a scrappy review site known for its branded Instagram hashtag (\"#Eeeeeats\") to a global taste maker in the world of cuisine. </p><p>   JPMorgan plans to give some of its customers, including credit-card holders, special access to the Infatuation's curated experiences, like Eeeeeatscon, and to certain content on its website. </p><p>   Mr. Stang will continue to run the business, which will operate as a separate brand within the bank. </p><p>   The Infatuation doesn't disclose its finances, including whether it is profitable. </p><p>   The company was exploring options including raising funds in recent months, according to a person familiar with the matter, and ultimately opted for an outright sale of the business. </p><p></p>",
