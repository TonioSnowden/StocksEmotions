  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>“Lessons must be learned” was the Bank of England's verdict today on the pensions crisis that has sparked unprecedented interventions in government bond markets.</p> <p>The presciently-timed quarterly update from its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62fb3f5c-a0a6-4a80-8d6f-2556f93dfb63\">financial policy committee</a> came as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d2da677-6284-4e36-b7a0-efcb52ed67b0\">sell-off in UK government bonds</a> accelerated, sending long-term borrowing costs higher. The market moves came after the Bank reiterated plans to halt its emergency gilt-buying scheme this Friday. The FT had reported earlier that BoE officials had briefed lenders in private that it might <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87a5b7bf-6786-427f-89d6-96b736dcb814\">extend the deadline</a>.</p> <p>The central bank has been trying to contain the fallout from chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's package of unfunded tax cuts, which rocked sterling and the gilt market and triggered a liquidity crisis among pension funds. </p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43c9011a-fe2d-4bf2-a697-a982dc06d050\">FT Editorial Board notes</a>, the BoE, left in the invidious position of trying to clean up someone else's mess, can only respond with a sticking plaster. Rowing back the government's proposed tax cuts would be far more effective, it argues. Huw Pill, the BoE's chief economist, warned today that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96adf42c-13bc-464a-b900-682fcf0d027d#post-5d7ce9b9-9e53-4bc3-99f0-8b66bddf08e6\">big change in interest rates</a> was a likely response to the government's plans.</p> <p>But until the chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f670179-e178-4c2e-bd53-06d019d26c7d\">unveils the details of his fiscal plan</a> (on Halloween — hold the jokes about spooking the markets, please) it is unclear where he might find the £60bn (according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies) needed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96b27b5d-1a75-42aa-8e97-201ec3005915\">stabilise the country's finances</a>. Cuts in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f78d6c5-4261-4bb9-ae49-a40fb8738742\">overseas aid</a> are one possibility but Truss reiterated in parliament today that she would not <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23eb24d3-5668-4fb0-adcd-c493e737d2e9\">cut public spending</a>.</p> <p>Even without the problems sparked by the “mini” Budget, there was another reminder this morning that the economic fundamentals remain challenging. GDP data for August showed that the economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0220ef6e-8849-4e0e-97e5-af94384644d3\">unexpectedly shrank</a>, suggesting the country may already be in recession. </p> <p>The data also revealed that the UK trade deficit was at its widest since records began in 1997. And while many of the country's problems are shared with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68f6187d-b9b4-432c-adff-65bc7c41f726\">rest&#xa0;of the world,</a>&#xa0;the IMF said yesterday that high inflation would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd8c0d49-22ad-4d5f-bc8e-58e3ba53a6a0\">last longer in the UK</a> than in similar economies.</p> <p>Truss's mantra is “growth, growth, growth”, but Sarah O'Connor argues that most people, faced with crippling rises in the cost of living, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c67c0727-f8f4-4f9e-9035-c223c62c8b9e\">haven't a clue what this means</a>.</p> <p>“Nobody,” O'Connor writes in her latest column, “is standing outside Downing Street with a megaphone chanting ‘What do we want? 2.5 per cent annual GDP growth. When do we want it? Over the medium term.'”</p> <p>The “mini” Budget, she adds, “worsened the parts of the economy that people understand and care about, in pursuit of a target people don't understand and don't care about.” </p> <p><em>Bookmark this: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/uk-financial-crisis\"><em>UK financial crisis full coverage</em></a></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/523c3d0c-d163-456b-8e69-7f70bd6c17be\">BASF to cut €1bn in costs</a> as energy crisis burns hole in profits</p></li>  <li><p>UK financial watchdog looking ‘very closely' at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96adf42c-13bc-464a-b900-682fcf0d027d#post-e1d9cbbf-44b7-4a58-963c-9522232afc63\">mortgage market</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96adf42c-13bc-464a-b900-682fcf0d027d#post-bb3f765b-baeb-43da-b412-d0a8b994a63f\">US producer prices</a> rise more than expected as inflation lingers</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96adf42c-13bc-464a-b900-682fcf0d027d\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The <strong>IMF</strong> warned that the world was facing its “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68f6187d-b9b4-432c-adff-65bc7c41f726\">darkest hour</a>” with threats to growth and financial stability. It urged governments to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a530b366-a432-4413-ac3b-ea62b61a80cd\">rein in spending</a> or risk undermining the confidence of bond market investors.</p> <p>Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf sums up the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1509f29f-f27c-4a01-a0f3-07877caec813\">downside risks</a> for the global economy and suggests what can, and should be done.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>In better news for the UK, <strong>unemployment</strong> is now at its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67c99847-e07a-4cc3-9a67-0d5d9d6575ce\">lowest since 1974</a>, albeit as long-term sickness keeps more older workers out of the labour market. Rising living costs mean real-terms earnings have fallen at near-record rates. </p> <p>A parliamentary report said the UK would miss its <strong>net zero target </strong>without serious changes in how people <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdc016d5-5f85-4881-880b-d3eee0153bc9\">eat, travel and live</a> and that the government's climate plan places “too great a reliance on undeveloped technologies.”</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong> slashed its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3b9362d-4183-4478-a838-12c44ee5a025\">growth forecasts</a> for the next two years, warning that the energy crisis would push Europe's largest economy into recession next year. It is now expected to shrink 0.4 per cent next year after growth of 1.4 per cent this year.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> said Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a5cfd12-a202-4242-b0ad-bed56f377142\">would face “consequences”</a> for its decision to cut oil production last week.
