In an interview with the FT's Laurence Fletcher, he described his bet against UK government bonds as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d54b4915-60a2-4f73-b1b9-6ea4b7523dd9\">“the gifts that keep on giving.”</a> His flagship European hedge fund is now up about 145 per cent this year, and he's predicting the pound could reach parity against the dollar.</p> <p>The UK fund manager has dismissed any suggestions that his politics influence his investment decisions but they do at times seem to align. Odey's bets against the British economy have helped him stage a major comeback and recoup years of losses that have led to investors fleeing his fund.</p> <p>Odey famously used the Italian proverb <em>il mattino ha l'oro in bocca</em>, meaning “the morning has gold in its mouth”, to describe the feeling of winning. Better check that it's not a pound coin instead. </p> <h1>Porsche: all gas, no brakes</h1> <p>Earlier this month at <strong>Formula One</strong>'s Italian Grand Prix, <strong>Red Bull</strong>'s <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> outsped <strong>Ferrari</strong>'s<strong> Charles Leclerc </strong>for first place, closing in on a second world title.</p> <p>Watching irritably from the stands, DD imagines, were<strong> Porsche </strong>executives who had hoped to one day be part of such a victory. After months of rumours, talks between Porsche and Red Bull about an acquisition of a stake in the racing team <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b03e1770-df4f-4fdb-800d-f5c9141e0976\">collapsed</a> earlier this month.</p> <p>It won't be the last time Porsche, which had wanted to buy 50 per cent of Red Bull, would follow in Ferrari's tire marks.</p> <p>The German sports car maker, which is owned by <strong>Volkswagen</strong>, aims to emulate its luxury Italian rival's successful public markets debut, hoping to raise €9.4bn and achieve a valuation of more than €75bn if it sells shares at the upper end of its target range.</p> <p>Such a feat would make the IPO one of the largest in Europe's history. But Porsche could find itself on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f04f887c-fdaa-45bd-8e0b-0e517eb54cc0\">crash course with reality</a>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11254568.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Porsche is attempting to imitate Ferrari's blockbuster listing in 2015, which proved that carmakers can transcend their manufacturing roots to achieve the valuations of luxury businesses.</p> <p>The Italian group's shares have gained more than 200 per cent since its IPO, and its shares currently trade at 30 times its projected earnings, within the range of <strong>LVMH</strong>, <strong>Hermes</strong> and <strong>Christian Dior</strong>.</p> <p>Critics say measuring Porsche against Ferrari <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfbfea32-976f-475e-bc5a-29325fa65ce6\">is a stretch</a>, however.</p> <p>The latter has cultivated an air of exclusivity with expensive sports cars in limited supply, a classic play by luxury groups adept in turning sticker shock into staying power. Porsche, on the other hand, has focused on accessibility.</p> <p>It leaves Porsche more vulnerable to economic downturns as its customers are more likely to cut spending, according to analysts. A brutal slump in financial markets amid soaring interest rates this year has surely culled the ranks of those wealthy enough to consider buying a <strong>911 Carrera</strong>.</p> <p>Complexity is another risk. DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6047a82c-d1bd-4fe2-bc81-fbe81a41a66f\">outlined several weeks ago</a> how the carmaker's convoluted ownership structure and questionable corporate governance decisions have made the offering a tougher sell.</p> <p>Volkswagen is listing a 12.5 per cent non-voting stake in Porsche to fund its continued push into electric vehicles.</p> <p>Bankers are hoping Porsche's “luxury with scale” pitch will rev up a dormant IPO market. </p> <p>One acknowledged to the FT that the concept is a bit of an oxymoron. So too is listing an ultra-luxury car company ahead of a looming recession.</p> <h1>Cold cuts and (alleged) conspiracy in New Jersey</h1> <p>When DD Mark Vandevelde <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a6d0864-eb26-4e54-8ab5-ffad2e8166ee\">visited</a> the<strong> Hometown Delicatessen</strong> in Paulsboro, New Jersey, early last year, the credit card machine did not work properly, diners barely outnumbered the staff, and a sign above the bar urged customers to “eat so we both don't starve”.</p> <p>The deli gained notoriety on Wall Street in April last year after the deli's parent company <strong>Hometown International </strong>was named by hedge fund manager <strong>David Einhorn </strong>as an example of the “quasi-anarchy” that he said had taken hold in financial markets.</p> <p>Now the feds think they can explain how Hometown's share price soared from $1 in October 2019 to nearly $14 by April 2021, even as revenue hovered at about $40,000 and lawyers for the company acknowledged that it was having “limited success operating its . . . delicatessen”.</p> <p><strong>Peter Coker</strong>, 80, and <strong>James Patten</strong>, 63, were arrested on securities fraud charges related to their alleged role in inflating the share price of Hometown International on Monday. Coker's 53-year-old son <strong>Peter Coker Jr</strong>, who lives in Hong Kong, also faces charges and is still at large.</p> <p>The FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da4135f9-6e4d-4896-87c3-91691d3a9b41\">has the full story</a>. In brief, the feds say Patten and his associates executed co-ordinated trades designed to make it look as though Hometown shares were in demand.</p> <p>On one occasion last January, an account belonging to a Staten Island resident who was an associate of Patten was used to sell shares at a price of $13.99, prosecutors said. The buyer, who lives in New Jersey, turned out to be a close relative of Patten's romantic partner, they added. Both orders were traced by law enforcement to an internet connection serving Patten's home, according to the indictment.</p> <p>“We have spent an enormous amount of time curating this asset,” Coker Jr wrote in a November 2020 email cited by prosecutors, in which he seemed to hold out hope that the deli might soon earn a listing on <strong>Nasdaq</strong>.</p> <p>He concluded: “[We] are now ready to take Hometown to the next level.”</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Following <strong>Jens Welter</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f67de02-407c-41bf-aeb5-aa823c8d02c2\">departure from Credit Suisse</a>, who will join <strong>Citigroup</strong> as co-head of European investment banking and chair of its consumer and retail advisory business, <strong>David Wah </strong>will become the Swiss group's sole global head of banking, according to a memo seen by the FT. <strong>Cathal Deasy </strong>and <strong>Giuseppe Monarchi</strong> will become co-heads of investment banking and capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>AJ Bell</strong>'s chair <strong>Lady Helena Morrissey </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/705df42f-ffad-4e78-afa1-b82f52346477?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">has resigned</a> from the fund platform after a disagreement with the <strong>UK's Financial Conduct Authority </strong>over the future role of the company's founder <strong>Andy Bell</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>John Witherow</strong>, one of<strong> Rupert Murdoch</strong>'s longest-serving editors, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7bb4b06-3dbd-4aec-a8db-a72f48666171\">has stood down</a> from the position at The Times and is to be replaced by his deputy <strong>Tony Gallagher</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Private equity firm<strong> PAI Partners</strong> has hired <strong>Winston Song </strong>as a partner to lead its consumer activities in North America, based in New York. He joins from <strong>Vestar Capital</strong>, where he was a managing director and co-head of its consumer division.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Against the grain </strong>Vivek Ramaswamy has become the face of rightwing backlash against ESG investing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e36595e-3cc3-4654-b2e3-1f0fa55769ee\">as he seeks to convince investors</a> that “woke” boardrooms hamper growth.
