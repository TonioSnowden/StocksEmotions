  "text": "<p>South African conglomerate Steinhoff is set to raise up to 4.6bn zlotys ($1bn) when it lists its Pepco chain of discount retailers in Warsaw this month in the latest in a series of asset sales.</p> <p>Pepco, which operates about 3,200 stores in countries including Poland, Romania and Hungary, as well as Poundland in the UK, said on Wednesday that shares in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5dee1157-c320-4088-b010-95e01b944c52\">offering</a> would be priced between 38 zlotys and 46 zlotys. </p> <p>In total, Steinhoff and members of Pepco's management team will sell 102.7m shares or 17.9 per cent of Pepco to the public, valuing the company at between 21.9bn zlotys and 26.5bn zlotys. The final price will be set on May 14, and trading will begin on May 26.</p> <p>A portion of shares will also be placed directly with some of Steinhoff's lenders, following an earlier agreement between the conglomerate and its creditors.</p> <p>Andy Bond, the former Asda chief executive who now runs Pepco, intends to sell more than 1m shares in the IPO, worth roughly €9.7m at the midpoint of the price range, though he will be subject to a lock-up period until the end of 2023 thereafter.</p> <p>Bond said the company planned to open a further 8,000 stores “over the longer term”, but would also keep “a clear focus on costs and delivering additional efficiencies as we grow”.</p> <p>Pepco's listing is likely to be one of the biggest this year on the Warsaw exchange, which has seen a flurry of activity since Poland's dominant ecommerce platform Allegro <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e6e00a4-8e83-44cb-bb4d-fe7d5316198f\">raised 9.2bn zlotys</a> last year in the country's largest initial public offering</p> <p>Steinhoff will initially retain a stake of about 82 per cent, but the group is looking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01eca674-bde4-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722\">to sell assets</a> to reduce debt after an accounting scandal in 2017.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has already sold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/666bb5d2-0799-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd\">Bensons for Beds, another UK retailer, to private equity group Alteri</a>, and&#xa0;has an option to sell a further 15.4m shares in Pepco in the offering if investors show sufficient interest. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are advising on the IPO.</p> <p>Pepco's business heartland is in central Europe, but the group is planning to expand elsewhere on the continent, such as Spain, and is targeting earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of more than €1bn within the next “five to seven years”. </p> <p>In the year to the end of September, it reported sales of €3.5bn and underlying ebitda of €229m. Ebitda was almost a third lower than in the previous 12 months, as the pandemic forced stores to close across Europe. </p> <p>Like many other discount retailers, Pepco does not trade online, as the small size of the purchases typically made by its customers makes the economics of ecommerce difficult.</p> <p>The group said last week that sales had risen 4.4 per cent in the six months to the end of March, thanks to the opening of more than 200 new stores. However, on a like-for-like basis, sales were down 2.1 per cent.</p><p>Source: James Shotter in Warsaw 2021 'Pepco and Poundland chains target multibillion valuation in IPO' FT.com 5 May.
