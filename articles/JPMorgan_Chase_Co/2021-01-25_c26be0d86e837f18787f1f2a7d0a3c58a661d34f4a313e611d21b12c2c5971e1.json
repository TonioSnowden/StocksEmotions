Not only does this man have a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2021/01/21/cesar-chavez-bust-placed-bidens-oval-office/6664391002/\">bust of the Latino labour activist Cesar Chavez</a> in his office,&#xa0;but several of his first actions as president have been about protecting workers. Within hours in office, Mr Biden had begun to push forward plans to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-executive-order-takes-steps-require-federal-contractors/story?id=75414753\">raise the minimum wage</a> in the US, using the power of federal contracts to do so,&#xa0;and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/20/trump-labor-board-460978\">fired the Donald Trump-appointed head</a> of the National Labor Relations Board,&#xa0;a man who had resisted calls to categorise Uber contractors as actual employees. As I explore in my <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d19d4f2-78ce-4a3f-96c2-bc722daf2d63\">latest column</a> this week, Biden's efforts are just part of several trends that may <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/what-biden-can-do-to-help-workers-labor-unions-in-2021?cmpid=BBD012221_OUS&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=210122&amp;utm_campaign=openamericas&amp;sref=S6wKAPAf\">support the labour share</a> of national income, even at a time when unemployment rates remain high.&#xa0;</p> <p>Just as Trump used executive orders to rule, so will Biden. They won't be quite as crucial to the process of pushing through his legislative agenda now that the Democrats have taken Congress. But they will be a quick and easy lever through which he can start to show what it means to “Build Back Better”. Many of the unilateral moves that the new president can make could have market moving impact. Below are just a few; Ed, I'm curious which of these you think will take priority and whether you'd add anything to the list of quick moves that the Biden administration can make.</p> <ol>  <li><p><strong>Limiting share buybacks.</strong> Biden has long been critical of buybacks, which were in fact considered market manipulation until the early 1980s. There's all kinds of <a href=\"https://capitalaspower.com/2021/01/baines-and-hager-the-great-debt-divergence-and-its-implications-for-the-covid-19-crisis-mapping-corporate-leverage-as-power/\">new research</a>&#xa0;to show that far from being a mark of confidence in a company's prospects, buybacks simply represent what UMass academic Bill Lazonick has dubbed the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity\">“downsize and distribute”</a>&#xa0;strategy of American companies, one that bolsters asset prices rather that productivity. The SEC, which is headed by reform-minded former Commodity Futures Trading Commission head Gary Gensler, could put limits on these right away, which wouldn't be a bad idea at a time when companies like Apple (which hasn't needed to borrow for operating expenses since the 1990s) have taken on record amounts of debt in a low interest rate environment, increasing potential financial fragility if rates move (which they could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d50304b4-45d3-47d8-b793-4a58a0e9fd59\">if inflation bites</a>). </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Review any Trump era mergers, and possibly revoke them</strong>. There are any number of ways to do this, from appointing officials at DoJ and FTC that are eager to reform competition policy (look for people like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7945c568-4fe7-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49\">Lina Khan</a>&#xa0;to get important positions), to leveraging the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which will be headed by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/17/biden-rohit-chopra-consumer-bureau-460086\">Rohit Chopra</a>, a former FTC commissioner who was very tough on Big Tech) to outline new ways in which consumer rights are being compromised by the increasing monopoly power of superstar companies.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Trade policy. </strong>This was Trump's biggest lever, of course, and how Biden will use it remains to be seen. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/12/29/951208082/who-is-katherine-tai-bidens-pick-for-u-s-trade-representative\">Katherine Tai</a>, the new trade representative,&#xa0;is extremely well qualified, particularly on China (she's a fluent Mandarin speaker). Whether or not she's as much of a tough dealmaker as Lighthizer remains to be seen. A number of former Center for a New American Security folks with very realpolitik views on China have already been appointed to positions in Defense, State and Treasury, which indicates to me that there will be some very serious thinking about China and joining up the dots on economic and foreign policy in what will be America's great strategic challenge for the future — how to deal with the One World, Two Systems challenge.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Recommended reading</h2> <ul>  <li><p>I recently picked up Ann Douglas' <em>Terrible Honesty</em>, a wonderful history of the Jazz Age, in anticipation of what I imagine might be a new 1920s style cultural free for all following the pandemic. It's amazing — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Terrible-Honesty-Mongrel-Manhattan-1920s/dp/0374524629\">go buy it right now</a>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>I thought James Fallows got it just about right in analysing <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/why-bidens-inaugural-address-succeeded/617779/\">why Joe Biden's inaugural speech was a success</a>. If he can continue to combine authenticity and realism, things could get better faster than we might think in this country.</p></li>  <li><p>And in the FT, I always love a good fashion decoding piece, like this one on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/649ce178-f790-489f-ae77-3a955fdcd702\">nascent sartorial messages of the Biden White House</a> by my colleague Lauren Fedor. And every Davos Man (and Woman) should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9395f9b-33de-45f6-a5ff-249d578676a7\">read Simon Kuper</a>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Edward Luce responds</h2> <p>Rana, I've no doubt that Biden's appointees will move aggressively on all fronts where Congressional approval is not required. The Biden years are not likely to be golden ones for Wall Street. It is worth emphasising that both Gary Gensler, as you have written, and Rohit Chopra, are close allies of Elizabeth Warren. The next Senate finance chair, Sherrod Brown, is also a strong ally of unions, as is Marty Walsh, the next secretary of Labor. Not to mention Janet Yellen, who has already set out in her testimony her ambitions for helping American workers. All of them, in one way or another, believe that America's risk lies in doing too little, not too much. The contrast between Biden's headline team and Barack Obama's is stark. Biden's people want to overhaul capitalism without first checking whether that would be OK with Jamie Dimon.&#xa0;</p> <p>But can they succeed? The answer greatly depends on how far Biden is prepared to go in scrapping Jim Crow-era niceties — including, most notably, the Senate filibuster. Mitch McConnell has already made it clear that he will oppose most of Biden's $1.9tn pandemic relief bill and the immigration bill in full. At some point in the coming weeks, Chuck Schumer and Biden will face a choice between continuing to venerate a Senate procedure that appears nowhere in the US constitution — it originated as a mid-19th century slave state tool to block the majority — or bite the bullet and push for the kinds of reforms most Americans have consistently said they want for years. Among these are sick leave, parental leave, a public healthcare option, gun control, modern infrastructure, pension security and a switch to stakeholder capitalism. The argument against abolishing the&#xa0;filibuster is that it would come back to bite Democrats when they are in the minority. Maybe so. But, as McConnell knows, the best way to ensure Democrats return to being a minority is for them to get nothing done. They've played that game too many times and lost.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Your feedback</h2> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to: ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7195088e-997b-4fbb-aab2-3a884a1dbae5\"><strong>A new lease of life for the American expert'</strong></a><strong>: </strong></p> <p>“I am wondering why there has been no budget proposal to increase funding for the IRS. It is my understanding that each dollar of additional funding on tax enforcement would yield an additional $5 in revenue. Surely this is a no-brainer at a time when the government is scrambling for revenue. Congress's systematic underfunding of the IRS sends the message that they really don't expect us to pay our taxes. Or that they endorse Trump's view that only suckers pay taxes.” <em>—&#xa0;Betsy Lampert Minkin, Brooklyn, New York </em></p> <p>“Anti-intellectualism has a long history in America, culminating, thus far, under Trump.&#xa0;&#xa0;Having spent more than 20 years in the US government's senior executive service, even my youthful libertarian passions evolved to earnest appreciation of the deep state, and the profound expertise therein that makes our government work, and in turn forms its civilising role.&#xa0; Expertise matters.” <em>— Robert A Rogowsky, Virginia, United States</em></p> <p>“We're still a long way from recovering in the UK from Michael Gove. Certainly the main quality for membership of Johnson's cabinet is a firm belief in Brexit, but knowledge of the subject has almost never been a pre-requisite for a cabinet post, under any government.&#xa0;Based solely on instinct, I feel the last government to contain any actual experts was Harold Wilson's, and even there I'm thinking mostly of Denis Healey with his wide-ranging hinterland.&#xa0;I worry about the psychological well-being of the actual scientists Johnson uses as human shields.” <em>— Judith Martin,&#xa0;Winchester, Hampshire, UK</em><br></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2bb6f410-f739-4b65-90ce-10e201fbb2d0.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Rana Foroohar 2021 'Joe Biden unleashed' FT.com 25 January.
