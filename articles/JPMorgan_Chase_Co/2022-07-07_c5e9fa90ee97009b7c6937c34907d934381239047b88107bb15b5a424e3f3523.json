  "text": "<p>How did stocks do?</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 346.87 points, or 1.1%, closing at 31,384.55.</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 57.62 points, or 1.5%, ending at 3,902.62.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP increased 259.49 points, or 2.3%, finishing at 11,621.35.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq marked 4 days of straight gains, their longest unbroken advance since March, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 70 points, or 0.23%, to 31,038, the S&amp;P 500 SPX increased 14 points, or 0.36%, to 3,845, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 40 points, or 0.35%, to 11,362.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>Stocks finished higher Thursday, putting them on pace for a string of weekly gains to kick off July.</p><p>\"It's a calm before the storm,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street Global Markets, referring to the release Friday morning of the June jobs report.</p><p>\"Inflation and employment prints are the most important right now,\" Loh said by phone. \"Anything significantly off from expectations is going to read as potentially signaling some sort of trend,\" which could influence the Fed's interest rate-hiking plans through year-end, he said.</p><p>Read: Hiring in U.S. likely fell to 18-month low in June —250,000 new jobs forecast</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the market higher as investors also reacted to the fall in commodity prices over the past month, which has helped to cause a moderation in inflation expectations and a fall in bond yields from their recent peak.

Chevron CVX rose 2%, while Exxon XOM gained 3.2%.</p><p>Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said economic growth fears that triggered the pullback in commodity prices also have inspired a shift in thinking about the Federal Reserve's plans.</p><p>Investors increasingly are betting that the central bank won't need to be as aggressive with its interest rate hikes.</p><p>\"Markets right now are betting that the Fed is going to break and follow the economy, not necessarily inflation,\" Nolte said.</p><p>Instead, traders are hoping that the battering delivered to stocks this year means that there might be an opportunity for the market to be pleasantly surprised when the U.S. second quarter earnings reporting season enters full swing next week.</p><p>While awaiting Friday's jobs report, investors heard from several Fed officials, including Fed Gov. Christopher Waller who said he backs a 75 basis point rate hike later this month, and likely another 50 basis point increase in September. Waller also said recession worries are \"overblown.\"</p><p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that he didn't see a U.S. recession on the horizon, but that there's a \"good chance\"of a soft economic landing.</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose for a second day in a row, up 9.6 basis points to 3.007%.</p><p>Data released Thursday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless insurance increasedby 4,000 last week, while the number of ongoing claims increased by 51,000.</p><p>The U.S. also saw its trade deficit narrow in May, data that Capital Economics says could help bolster growth in the second quarter. Lately, investors have increasingly feared that the U.S. economy might see slow growth, or perhaps even a contraction, during the second quarter.</p><p>Single stock movers</p><p>* Shares of Micron MU ended up 2.6%, while those of AMD AMD rose 5.2% and Nvidia NVDA shares gained 4.8% after South Korea's Samsung KR:005930 reported stronger than expectedearnings guidance.</p><p>* Freeport-McMoRan FCX, Schlumberger SLB and Diamondback Energy FANG, APA Corp.
