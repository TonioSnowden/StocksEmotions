  "text": "<p>You report the chief executives of Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan have committed to complying with any US government demand to pull out of China if Beijing were to use force to reunite Taiwan (“US lenders ready to quit China in event of Taiwan war”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48b23ac0-c416-4cbf-b035-f0c6cea1fa4d\">Report</a>, September 23). </p> <p>The UK and the US have a special relationship and the two countries align with each other on most international policies. The UK has been a stronger supporter on sanctions against Russia. </p> <p>It would be interesting to know the position of the chief executive of HSBC if he is confronted with similar questions as his US counterparts. </p> <p>HSBC is the largest bank in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.</p> <p><strong>Tony SK Li</strong> <br><em>Hong Kong</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: How would HSBC boss react to China-Taiwan war?'
