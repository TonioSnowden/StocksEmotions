  "title": "GE stock has gained despite warnings and recession concerns. Will its earnings report confirm or reverse that trend? GE reports Q3 results before the market opens on Tuesday. Profit and FCF estimates have fallen since Q2 results were reported but the stock has gained",
  "text": "<p>While the company reported surprisingly positive free cash flow (FCF) for the second quarter, GE cut its full-year FCF guidance by about $1 billion.</p><p>Since GE reported second-quarter results on July 26, a number of economic data releasesshowed that the economy was slowing, sparking increasing concerns that a recession is looming.</p><p>And yet GE's stock, which rallied 1.2% in afternoon trading Monday, has gained 3.0% since the last quarter's earnings report, while the SPDR Industrial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLI has slipped 0.7% and the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has declined 3.5%.</p><p>Does the stock's recent outperformance mean investors are too optimistic, or are concerns about how the global economy is affecting multinational industrials overblown?</p><p>Analyst Nicole DeBlase at Deutsche Bank seems to believe it's the latter. She reiterated her buy rating in a recent note to clients while raising her price target from $88 to $92, implying a significant upside from current levels of $74.</p><p>DeBlase said the setup to the current earnings season feels nearly identical to the last one, as the stock market remains volatile and recessionary indicators flash red. In addition, she said a pullback in consumer spending and residential construction remains evident, with companies in similar industries, including transportation, chemicals and autos, flagging deterioration.</p><p>Although GE missed second-quarter revenue expectations and cut the FCF outlook, the stock surged 4.6% the day earnings were reported after a big earnings beat.</p><p>But at the same time, DeBlase noted that multi-industrial and machinery companies \"remain steadfast\" in their commentary, and demand remains unchanged and robust, boosting order books to record levels.</p><p>\"Management teams are not naïve (neither are investors), and most have noted that they are closely monitoring order/quotation activity for signs of weakness — but this simply has not materialized,\" DeBlase wrote. \"So we remain in a holding pattern, waiting for negative commentary and downward [earnings per share] revisions.\"</p><p>GE is expected to report third-quarter adjusted EPS of 47 cents a share, according to a FactSet survey of analysts down from 57 cents in the same period a year ago. The current EPS consensus has fallen from 59 cents since GE reported second-quarter results.</p><p>The FactSet revenue consensus is $18.40 billion, implying a slight decline from $18.43 billion a year ago. The consensus has dropped from $18.81 billion at the end of July.</p><p>And the FactSet consensus for the closely watched free cash flow is $284.5 million, but that has dropped from $956.2 billion at the end of July.</p><p>Even J.P. Morgan's Stephen Tusa, who has a stock price target of $50, implying 32% downside risk, doesn't seem too pessimistic about the results.</p><p>\"We are neutral into the print as GE already 'pre-announced' negatively on FCF, and will likely maintain hope for a strong 4Q finish ahead of the upcoming [Healthcare] split,\" Tusa wrote.</p><p>The split refers to GE's plan tospin off its healthcare unit in early 2023, as part of a larger plan to split the conglomerate into three independent, publicly traded companies.</p><p>Among GE's current business segments, the FactSet revenue consensus for Aviation is $6.55 billion, for Healthcare is $4.52 billion, for Power is $4.06 billion and for Renewable Energy is $3.46 billion.</p><p>Investors should also watch for how much the strong dollar affects GE's results, as a rising dollar lowers the value of profit and revenue generated overseas. And in2021, revenue generated from non-U.S. geographies represented 55% of GE's total revenue. The U.S. Dollar Index DXY, which tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies of the U.S.'s larger trade partners, surged 7.1% during the third quarter, and ended September 19.0% above where it was a year ago.</p><p>For the full year, Wall Street is expecting EPS of $2.66, revenue of $74.02 billion and FCF of $4.20 billion.</p><p>GE stock has gained despite warnings and recession concerns. Will its earnings report confirm or reverse that trend?</p>",
