  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> UK chancellor <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong> is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5dac84e-dabf-4408-8d65-1db0ecc315c3\">scrap Britain's cap on bankers' bonuses</a>, introduced after the 2008 financial crash, in a controversial move to boost the City of London's global competitiveness.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Junior bankers head to Málaga</p></li>  <li><p>Growth investors confront the tech rout</p></li>  <li><p>Microsoft-Activision's regulatory woes</p></li> </ul> <h1>The City or La Ciudad? A junior banker's dilemma</h1> <p>An unseasonable chill has descended upon Wall Street recently, even as the rest of Manhattan basks in the late September sun.</p> <p>Not that the 27 <strong>Citigroup</strong> analysts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/119e224b-f126-4a34-b775-db0666c97c33\">who just touched down</a> in Málaga have noticed.</p> <p>The US investment bank is celebrating the opening of its new hub for junior investment bankers in the sunny Spanish city, a move it insists is not a gimmick as lenders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83fea40d-eae7-4386-be34-013ed963589e\">battle for young talent</a> amid criticism of burnout issues and waning financial resources.</p> <p>Meanwhile, their New York-based peers, who accepted six-figure salaries, <strong>Pelotons</strong> and other perks in exchange for gruelling 95-hour workweeks, find themselves in a more precarious position.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1398e9f5-8e93-4134-ad37-fb5ea78ae7bf\">readying a round of job cuts</a> in the coming weeks and things <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd62caf3-6aa7-49d2-8cd8-86fb0d48da51\">aren't looking much better</a> at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, as a dealmaking and IPO slowdown threatens to drag third-quarter investment banking revenues to half as much as the previous year's.</p> <p>For Citi's newest recruits, there's a trade-off to working in Málaga, which promises eight-hour days and work-free weekends: staff there will be paid about half the starting salaries allotted to first-year analysts in London and New York.</p> <p>Citi insists it's a deal that suits both its employees and the bank. “We suffer from a lot of churn like the rest of the industry, we lose talent to private equity and tech, so we are eager to understand if we can stop that by offering a better work-life balance,” said <strong>Manolo Falcó</strong>, the lender's global co-head of investment banking.</p> <p>The 3,000 applicants who applied to the two-year programme seem to agree. But rivals have dismissed the idea as a stunt that could ultimately harm those who choose to launch their careers in the more laid-back setting.&#xa0;</p> <p>If HBO's City drama<em> Industry</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e42acbbe-1f9d-4bee-9beb-1de1a18eaae4\">is to hold any truths</a>, the initial long hours are all too common for early career bankers. What will Málaga alumni's future bosses make of their requests for better work-life balance?</p> <p>Wall Street claims to have made strides since the infamous “working conditions survey” compiled by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">burnt-out</a> junior Goldmanites, which led banks to raise salaries as a means to survive the onslaught of deals over the past two years.</p> <p>Citi, which has struggled in the past to match its rivals in terms of pay, thinks it has found a way to solve the problem of recruiting and retaining young talent without simply throwing money at it.</p> <p>DD is keen to see how they fare when their two years are up. “If you want to go all the way, you have to move from Málaga eventually,” said Falcó.</p> <h1>Plight of the tech bulls</h1> <p>In the height of the retail trading and meme stock frenzy, <strong>Cathie Wood </strong>rode to fame on her bullish tech bets — so much so that it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a93f4de2-35d2-44e1-a6a1-0000cba0dd4d\">inspired T-shirts</a> crowning her “The Queen of the bull market”.</p> <p>Wood is one in a group of prominent growth investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dedb1e8-19d8-48f7-b838-d181e158c8f0\">to be knocked off their thrones</a> by the recent tech sell-off, the FT's Harriet Agnew reports, calling into question the future of an industry powered by high-stakes bets on a technological revolution that hasn't quite lived up to expectations.</p> <p>The star stockpicker's flagship exchange-traded fund Ark Innovation has dropped about 55 per cent this year to date, while her firm <strong>Ark Investment Management </strong>has lost almost half of its assets under management since December.</p> <p>DD readers will be familiar with the travails of SoftBank's <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>. The Japanese tech bull <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d84b488-8f97-4742-ab46-154d3b312a82\">declared himself “ashamed”</a> following steep losses by his flagship Vision Funds in the first half of the year and sold off a majority of his most successful investment in<strong> Alibaba</strong> in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef6b1b24-a70a-403f-bcd1-d19b8c611f80\">frantic effort</a> to assuage investors.</p> <p>Tiger Global founder <strong>Chase Coleman</strong>, a protégé of the late <strong>Julian Robertson</strong>, has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4ab8f36-f539-4673-bfa5-82e77cf34777\">similarly humbled</a>. Both Coleman and Son are now in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b28bc12-5ccb-488b-a727-fc5eb5fbe210\">“defensive mode”</a>, slashing their equities exposures and biding their time atop swelling cash piles.</p> <p>As the outlook continues to sour, some growth investors are forging a new path. Coatue Management, the fund run by Coleman's fellow “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a393020-4c43-4bd8-8a88-221459bcee58\">Tiger cub</a>” <strong>Philippe Laffont</strong>, is raising $2bn for a structured equity strategy, which lends money to cash-strapped private companies unwilling to raise dilutive equity financing at depressed valuations.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I felt that we needed to use the crisis to think of a new way of doing things,” Laffont told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>Others have been less inclined to accept defeat. On Tuesday, Wood's Ark embarked on its biggest stock-buying spree since February, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-14/cathie-wood-goes-on-biggest-dip-buying-binge-since-february\">according to Bloomberg</a>, scooping up 27 stocks across its eight exchange traded funds even as Wall Street suffered its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1474a6fa-3c53-42f4-9e6c-21f130914599\">worst sell-off since June of 2020</a>.</p> <p>“Buy the dip” has been a rallying cry of growth investors for years. That theory is being put to the test.</p> <h1>Call of Duty: antitrust ops</h1> <p>Microsoft's huge bet on gaming is attracting the attention of regulators on a global scale.</p> <p>The tech giant's $75bn acquisition of video game maker <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> is facing extensive antitrust investigations in both London and Brussels following concerns by rivals, including <strong>Sony</strong>, that it will exclude them from accessing blockbuster game<em> <strong>Call of Duty</strong></em>.</p> <p>The companies have been in talks with regulators in Brussels since the deal was announced eight months ago — an indication of how rigorously officials intend to investigate the deal.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the UK, the<strong> Competition and Markets Authority </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a55cc28e-3092-4725-a1a0-97c1bf6eed0f\">is expected to launch</a> a “phase 2” probe into the transaction this week unless it sees a serious commitment by Microsoft to preserve competition.</p> <p>Microsoft hopes to close the deal by next June. But that could be wishful thinking.</p> <p>“It's not going to be a walk in the park for Microsoft,” a person with direct knowledge of the probe in Brussels told DD's <strong>Javier Espinoza</strong>.</p> <p>Microsoft has defended its largest-ever deal by arguing that <em>Call of Duty</em>, the blockbuster game that has brought in $30bn in lifetime sales for Activision, will remain available on other companies' game consoles after the transaction rather than being turned into an exclusive title on Microsoft's Xbox.</p> <p>Regulators seem unwilling to take the US tech company's word for it. EU watchdogs have cleared Big Tech acquisitions of smaller rivals in the past, including<strong> Facebook'</strong>s purchases of<strong> WhatsApp</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, but regret not going after so-called killer acquisitions in the past.</p> <p>Expect a drawn-out fight.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bank of America</strong> has appointed <strong>Baxter International</strong> chief executive and chair<strong> José Almeida</strong> to its board of directors.</p></li>  <li><p>Citigroup has hired<strong> Barry Weir</strong>, a <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> veteran known for working on mining deals, as a managing director in London, according to an internal memo seen by DD.</p></li>  <li><p>Private equity firm <strong>Francisco Partners </strong>has hired <strong>Erin Blake</strong> as a managing director of legal M&amp;A in San Francisco and <strong>Jason Warner </strong>joins as head of data science in New York. They join from <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis </strong>and <strong>Blackstone</strong>, respectively.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Hogan Lovells</strong> has appointed<strong> John Livesey</strong> as a partner in the firm's global private equity practice, based in London. He joins from <strong>Linklaters</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Swing and a miss </strong>PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan has touted the tour's prudent financial management to incentivise players not to defect to Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf. But his high-flying lifestyle <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pga-tour-liv-golf-private-jet-jay-monahan-11663158688?mod=hp_featst_pos3\">clashes with that narrative</a>, the Wall Street Journal reports.</p> <p><strong>Business and politics </strong>Italy's incoming government will be tasked with deciding the futures of local lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena and restructured national airline ITA.
