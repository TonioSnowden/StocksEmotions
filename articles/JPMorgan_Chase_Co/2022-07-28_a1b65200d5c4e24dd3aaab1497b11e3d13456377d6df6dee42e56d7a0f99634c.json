  "text": "<p>Gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy, fell at an inflation and seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.9% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That followed a 1.6% pace of contraction in the first three months of 2022.</p><p>The report indicated the economy met a commonly used definition of recession—two straight quarters of declining economic output.</p><p>The official arbiter of recessions in the U.S. is the National Bureau of Economic Research, which defines one as a significant decline in economic activity, spread across the economy for more than a few months. Its Business Cycle Dating Committee considers factors including employment, output, retail sales and household income—and it usually doesn't make a recession determination until long after the fact.</p><p>Let's hope that job openings remain plentiful, though this column recognizes that such hope will have a tough time triumphing over experience. Don Rissmiller and Brandon Fontaine at Strategas write in a note to clients:</p><p>While recessions require broad-based weakness in data (especially in employment numbers), two consecutive negative quarters of GDP outside of a recession are rare (the last time was 1947).</p><p>Americans may now seek to party like it's 1947, but our shrinking economy desperately needs pro-growth policies and Washington seems determined to continue implementing the opposite. It's also discouraging that the White House is spending so much time marketing favorable descriptions of the economy rather than trying to improve it.</p><p>Anticipating that this morning's GDP report would be another downer, amid continuing White House assertions that America is not in a recession, Charles Lane wrote in the Washington Post:</p><p>How about we compromise and call the next economic downturn, whenever it comes, a \"banana,\" in honor of Alfred E. \"Fred\" Kahn?</p><p>In 1978, Kahn — a Cornell University economist in charge of President Jimmy Carter's inflation-fighting efforts — said that failure to get soaring prices under control could lead to a \"deep, deep depression.\" Carter's aides, perturbed at the possible political fallout, instructed him never to say that word, or \"recession,\" again.</p><p>We don't know whether this instruction stirred the wrath of Kahn, a verbal stickler notoriously disdainful of cant and euphemism; in a previous government job, he had sent around a memo telling staff not to use words such as \"herein.\"</p><p>It did trigger his wit, though: In his next meeting with reporters, Kahn puckishly said the nation was in \"danger of having the worst banana in 45 years.\"</p><p>Today's GDP report may inspire Democrats to reach deep into the strategic vocabulary reserve for a positive label. But if they want to improve the underlying product, they would do well to consider Kahn's legacy. Mr. Lane writes:</p><p>Once again, inflation threatens a Democratic presidency, and the Biden White House does not have many more effective tools at its disposal than Carter's did during Kahn's stint as the hapless chairman of something called the Council on Wage and Price Stability.</p><p>As Kahn predicted, it took a sharp — how do you say? — downturn, engineered by Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and marked by unemployment that peaked in 1982 at 10.8 percent, to crush inflation. A similar Fed rate-raising campaign that began in March is why many worry about the risk of a banana now.</p><p>While Carter's inflation-fighting efforts did mostly fail, in one area they did some good. That was the deregulation of passenger airlines, trucking and freight rail, which exposed long-standing government-protected cartels in those industries to competition, resulting in lower costs throughout the economy.</p><p>Team Biden instead intends to gore consumers and taxpayers by throwing hundreds of billions of dollars of additional subsidies at the inefficient producers in the government-backed alternative-energy cabal. And Biden allies even seem to have persuaded a senator from a state that produces market-based energy to support this latest inflation fuel.</p><p>***</p><p>Joe Manchin, You're No Riley Moore Speaking of the West Virginia Democrat who has agreed to force taxpayers to fund inefficient competitors to one of his state's biggest industries, Sen. Joe Manchin doesn't speak for all West Virginia officials.</p><p>A Thursday press release from the office of the Mountain State's treasurer signals that he's not going to patronize financial companies opposed to his state's energy production:</p><p>West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore today announced he has published West Virginia's first Restricted Financial Institution List, deeming five financial institutions ineligible for state banking contracts.</p><p>Treasurer Moore has determined that BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. are engaged in boycotts of fossil fuel companies, according to a new state law, and are no longer eligible to enter into state banking contracts with his Office.</p><p>\"As Treasurer, I have a duty to act in the best interests of the State's Treasury and our people when choosing financial services for West Virginia,\" Treasurer Moore said. \"Any institution with policies aimed at weakening our energy industries, tax base and job market has a clear conflict of interest in handling taxpayer dollars.\"</p><p>... Six financial institutions were initially identified as potentially engaged in boycotts of energy companies and provided with written notice. These institutions then had 30 days to submit additional information disputing their potential inclusion on the Restricted Financial Institution List. All six institutions submitted responses, which the Treasurer reviewed alongside each institution's public policy statements.</p><p>Out of the six financial institutions initially noticed, U.S. Bancorp was not placed on the List because it demonstrated to the Treasurer that it has eliminated policies against financing coal mining, coal power and pipeline construction activities from its Environmental and Social Risk Policy.</p><p>\"Each financial institution placed on the Restricted Financial Institution List today has published written environmental or social policies categorically limiting commercial relations with energy companies engaged in certain coal mining, extraction or utilization activities, rather than considering the financial or risk profile for each company,\" Treasurer Moore said. \"These policies explicitly limit commercial engagement with an entire energy sector based on subjective environmental and social policies.\"</p><p>Noting that fossil fuels enable significant economic activity and tax revenue, Mr. Moore adds:</p><p>\"While the 'Environmental, Social and Governance' or 'ESG' movement might be politically popular in California or New York, financial institutions need to understand their practices are hurting people across West Virginia,\" Treasurer Moore said. \"I simply cannot stand by and allow financial institutions working against West Virginia's critical industries to profit off the very funds their policies attempt to diminish.\"</p><p>If large institutions from Wall Street to Washington rule out efficient energy in a time of high prices and shrinking GDP, many Americans could be facing the worst banana of their lives.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>U.S. Economy Still Shrinking</p>",
