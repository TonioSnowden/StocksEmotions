  "title": "Asian Junk Bonds Set for Stronger 2022 After Property Turmoil; Chinese policy easing could help drive rebound, investors and analysts say",
  "text": "<p>Some investors also argue the Asian high-yield market has grown too pessimistic about default risk, and beaten-up bond prices now offer good value.</p><p>Developers such as China Evergrande Group—which was recently downgraded to a default grade by Fitch Ratings—have been reeling from government curbs on borrowing, falling home sales and evaporating market confidence. Chinese property companies are a major part of the region's high-yield market and China overall accounts for over half of Asia's $210 billion dollar-denominated junk-bond market, according to IHS Markit.</p><p>In a report this month, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts wrote that market prices for Chinese high-yield property bonds implied close to a 37% default rate, a level that suggested valuations \"have probably overshot to the extremely pessimistic end.\"</p><p>Asian high-yield could return as much as 12% next year, said Ek Pon Tay, senior portfolio manager for emerging-market debt at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \"The market is pricing in more negative scenarios than are likely to occur, so the risk-reward here is attractive,\" he said.</p><p>That would be a big turnaround from this year. An ICE BofA index of high-yield corporate debt from regional emerging markets has generated a total return of about negative 18% this year, versus a 3% positive return for a similar index for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Total return measures the gains or losses generated from price moves, together with cash payments of interest and principal.</p><p>Mr. Tay said he was willing to invest in certain high-yield developers, provided they had proof of solid liquidity, didn't have a lot of short-term debt to refinance, and had access to onshore funding, even if China didn't unleash major easing measures. Elsewhere, he said he was positive on Indian renewable-energy bonds and sovereign bonds from Sri Lanka and Pakistan.</p><p>While some of next year's return is likely to come from hefty interest payments that reflect the sector's comparatively high yields, a large chunk of it is likely to be produced by a rebound in bond prices.</p><p>Asian high-yield could offer high single-digit percentage returns next year, including price gains of up to 5%, said Dhiraj Bajaj, fund manager and head of fixed income for Asia at Lombard Odier.</p><p>As bond prices have fallen, yields have soared, and a gap has opened up between yields on lower-rated debt and on comparatively safer bonds. Bonds due 2023 from Logan Group Co. with double-B credit ratings, near the top of the sub-investment-grade scale, were quoted at yields of 8.0% on Friday, according to Tradeweb. Bonds due the same year from single-B-rated Yuzhou Group Holdings Co. were yielding 80%.</p><p>Investors say it could still be some time before the property sector finds a more stable footing.</p><p>\"We think the most acute and difficult phase of China's policy tightening is now behind us,\" said Mr. Bajaj at Lombard Odier. \"However…we think the domino effect of defaults is likely to continue in the first quarter of next year for stressed private-sector developers.\" Mr. Bajaj said he is focusing on higher-rated Asian credit to make a modest return, and expects default rates to moderate next year.</p><p>Likewise, Paula Chan, senior portfolio manager for Asia fixed income at Manulife Investment Management, said she will remain defensive for the first half of 2022 as conditions remain challenging.</p><p>But she said the second half of the year would be better for investors, as monetary easing was likely to kick in and help support China's economic recovery. \"The outlook for the sector is now turning to one of stability,\" Ms. Chan said.</p><p>Ms. Chan said she shielded Manulife's China High Yield Bond Fund by investing in better-quality developers and has managed to avoid some high-profile defaults. Investing in Indian renewable-energy producers and Indonesian corporate junk bonds also helped diversify the fund, offsetting Chinese property risks, she said.</p><p>Write to Frances Yoon at frances.yoon@wsj.com</p><p>Asian Junk Bonds Set for Stronger 2022 After Property Turmoil</p>",
