  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Bank of America Stands Out From Pack  ---  Strong interest revenue growth set against steady costs gave the company a big boost this quarter  ----  By Telis Demos",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Banks are facing a tough environment of tepid loan demand and low interest rates. So it doesn't take much to stand out. </p><p>\n  Bank of America has so far seen the biggest share-price boost from earnings among the megabanks, jumping 4.5% on Thursday after reporting third-quarter results. Like its peers, total loans grew a bit from the prior quarter, and it generated lots of fees from Wall Street investment banking. But Bank of America managed to generate year-over-year double-digit revenue growth while keeping expenses flat. </p><p>\n  That is in part a reflection of the bank's highly positive sensitivity to rising rates, which though hardly soaring have been trending higher in some key ways. For example, one drag on Bank of America's interest revenue diminished as the rate of prepayments on mortgages fell. The bank put a good amount of deposits to work into the market at better rates than cash. </p><p>\n  Bank of America's net interest yield on earning assets jumped from the second to third quarter, from 1.61% to 1.68%. Similar measures were flat or only slightly higher at Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Overall, Bank of America's third-quarter net interest income grew by about 10% from where it was a year ago. </p><p>\n  The bank's expected sensitivity benefit to rising rates in the future is diminishing: It now estimates a $7.2 billion benefit from a 1 percentage-point-across-the-board jump in rates, compared with a $10.5 billion estimate at the end of last year. But like peers it is still growing its liquidity sources and is still comfortably above minimum capital requirements, giving it flexibility to continue to put money to work when the environment is even better. </p><p>\n  Other banks would of course also benefit as the economy overcomes the effects of the Delta variant and supply-chain-related slowdowns in activity. For investors, Bank of America's current valuation of about 2.1 times tangible book value looks relatively reasonable: It is cheaper than JPMorgan at 2.4 times. Some of that gap reflects JPMorgan's typically higher return on equity. But Bank of America has been buying back more stock, so there may be potential for the valuation gap between the two to stay narrow by historical standards. </p><p>\n  Bank of America was willing on Thursday to give strong indications of its net interest income outlook next year. Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts that if rates move as markets currently expect them to, and if deposits and loans continue to grow to some degree, the bank should see net interest income well above what it will have generated in 2021. </p><p>\n  But continued cost control might be the real linchpin of any stock outperformance. Bank of America's noninterest expense was flat year-over-year, at $14.4 billion in the third quarter even as total revenue grew 12%. The bank said that while it expects some overall inflation in its expenses, including whatever is needed to retain banker talent, it could also see some roll off in costs related to Covid measures and administering government stimulus programs. </p><p>\n  Bank of America shares have jumped more than 45% this year, putting it among the best bank performers. If it can keep up this kind of quarter, it could stay on top of the heap. </p><p></p>",
