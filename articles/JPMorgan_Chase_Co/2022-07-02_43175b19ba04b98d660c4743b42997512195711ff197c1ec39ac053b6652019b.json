  "title": "REVIEW --- How T. Rex Became A Global Paleo-Celebrity --- Ever since the first specimen was unearthed over a century ago, the public has been fascinated by the fearsome prehistoric predator -- as have museums, eager to draw big crowds.",
  "text": "<p>The science of paleontology can trace its origins to miners in England who kept finding strange bones as they searched for material to power the dawning Industrial Age. Early naturalists eventually realized that they were handling remnants of prehistoric species.</p><p>During the Gilded Age, titans such as J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and Marshall Field used their millions to fund, respectively, the American Museum of Natural History, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum, hoping to temper rising concerns about their concentrated wealth with public works that brought scientific discoveries to everyday Americans. In his 1889 essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" Carnegie called such efforts \"the true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth, the reconciliation of the rich and the poor.\" At the 1895 opening of the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, he said that if the institutions he envisioned \"be not popular and attract the manual toilers, and benefit them, it will have failed in its mission.\"</p><p>What museums needed to achieve this purpose, however, was something showstopping to bring visitors in the door. Nothing quite compared with the still-new discoveries of dinosaurs. When remains of a Hadrosaurus foulkii found in suburban New Jersey were transformed into the world's first mounted dinosaur specimen in 1868, arranged in a lifelike pose at Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences, more than 100,000 people -- a number twice the institution's annual attendance -- came to gawk.</p><p>Other museums were quick to realize that dinosaurs were their ticket to public relevancy. The board of trustees of the American Museum of Natural History urged its curators to find their own specimens, declaring in one letter that \"We must sprinkle our wholesome bread with a little sugar.\"</p><p>So began the search for the largest, most impressive dinosaur fossil imaginable -- and also the story of Barnum Brown, who would unearth what has become a fixture of global popular culture. A child of Kansas farmers, Brown got his unusual first name from a family trip to P. T. Barnum's \"Great Travelling World's Fair\" and his curiosity about the prehistoric world from playing in the local soil, where he found seashells and wondered how they ended up nearly 600 miles from any coastline.</p><p>Paleontology was still a young disciple in the last decades of the 19th century. The sense of being at the beginning appealed to Brown as he reached adulthood. At his first digs as a college student at the University of Kansas in 1894, he showed a preternatural ability to read contours of rock and the patience to unearth treasures without destroying them, leading to the nickname \"Mr. Bones.\" He found two triceratops skulls while still an undergraduate and soon received a letter from Henry Fairfield Osborn, the head of the American Museum of Natural History's nascent vertebrate paleontology department, asking if he would join a museum-sponsored search for large fossils.</p><p>Osborn saw building out the museum's dinosaur halls as his path to fame and influence. He also believed that spectacular fossils would confer on him the prestige to champion his unfounded racial theories, which held that northern Europeans were a separate, superior species. But first, he needed something that no other museum could buy.</p><p>Osborn sent Brown into unforgiving terrain from Patagonia to Canada in search of a prehistoric trophy, all the while fearing that his competitors in Chicago and Pittsburgh were a step closer to unearthing something that would shock the world. After prospectors working for the Carnegie Museum discovered a giant, long-necked species that they named Diplodocus carnegii after the museum's founder, Osborn pushed Brown harder to prove his worth.</p><p>In 1902, under the broiling summer sun outside of Jordan, Mont., Brown became the first human to peer down at the now iconic silhouette of T. rex. Everything about the creature strained belief: its serrated teeth as long as a human hand; its immense, nearly 4-foot long jaws capable of exerting enough pressure to explode the bones of its prey; its hips, which stood nearly 13 feet above ground. It was as if a child's conception of a monster had become real. It showed unmistakably that the history of life was more varied and surreal than anyone had imagined.</p><p>Fame did not come instantly, however. Osborn didn't initially believe Brown's reports of the newly discovered creature, writing in one letter to him in the field that \"both Carnegie and Chicago have done better than we have.\" Meanwhile, the job of removing all the bits of rock from the fossil -- encased in what Brown called \"the hardest blue sandstone I ever tried to work in\" -- and preparing it for public display required a monastic level of discipline and delicacy, extending over 13 years. During that time, Brown found two more T. rex specimens; no one else found one for three decades.</p><p>When Brown's first T. rex was finally unveiled in October 1915, the fact that it was a massive carnivore -- rather than the larger but herbivorous brontosaurus or diplodocus -- instantly appealed to the public. Suddenly, there was tangible evidence that life's daily drama of survival -- filled with predation, evasion and chance -- had been occurring for millions of years before humans appeared.</p><p>The creature's obvious strength led to an onslaught of letters to the museum asking how such a beast could have ever gone extinct. With little else to go on, science filled the gaps with prejudice, formulating theories linked with the burgeoning eugenics movement that the creature's low intelligence probably led to its demise. (Many paleontologists now believe, based on calculations of the ratio of its likely brain size to body size, that a T. rex was roughly as intelligent as a chimpanzee.)</p><p>T. rex as a symbol of raw power soon leapt into popular culture, appearing as the villain in entertainment such as the movie adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\" -- the first film to be shown as in-flight entertainment on a commercial airline, in 1925, nearly seven decades before the first \"Jurassic Park.\"</p><p>J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie are long gone, but the idea of owning a T. rex still exerts its magic. In January, a Zoom interview from the home of actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson on Monday Night Football went viral, not for what he was saying but for the apparent presence of a T. rex skull over his right shoulder. Mr. Johnson soon clarified that the specimen wasn't real but a replica of the skull of the T. rex sold by Christie's in 2020, known as Stan.</p><p>\"Pretty cool and badass, isn't it?\" Mr. Johnson later said, adding, \"If I was the proud owner of the real Stan, I sure as hell wouldn't keep him in my office. I'd keep him in a museum, so the world could enjoy, study and learn from him.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Randall is the author of \"The Monster's Bones: The Discovery of T. Rex and How It Shook Our World,\" published in June by W.W. Norton &amp; Co.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
