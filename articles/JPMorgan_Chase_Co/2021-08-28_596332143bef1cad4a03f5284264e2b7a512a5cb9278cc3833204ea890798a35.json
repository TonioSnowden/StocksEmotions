  "text": "<p>Today, the answer is clearer than the upstarts could have imagined. They now find themselves at the center of the debate. Ms. Khan, 32, is the new head of one of Washington's two antitrust enforcement arms, the Federal Trade Commission that Brandeis helped to create in 1914. President Biden has nominated another neo-Brandeisian, Jonathan Kanter, 48, to head the other key enforcer, the Justice Department's antitrust division. White House competition policy is handled by Tim Wu, 49, who wrote a 2018 book advocating a Brandeis restoration.</p><p>They still face an uphill battle to enact their agenda, but it's a remarkable advance for a movement that didn't even have a name a few years ago. It underscores Mr. Biden's intention, as he puts it, to \"change the paradigm\" in economic policy, repudiating the records not only of recent Republican presidents but of Democrats as well. Just as Donald Trump ripped up decades of bipartisan consensus on trade and globalization, Mr. Biden has assembled a team attempting to transform how the federal government deals with big business. In siding with the neo-Brandeisians, he has passed over experienced Democratic antitrust experts who cast the new ideology as a reckless experiment that, as one Clinton-Obama veteran says, \"will slow economic growth and harm consumers.\"</p><p>Much of what animates the New Brandeis movement is the rise of big tech. Its advocates believe that the dominant, winner-take-all platforms of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are reminiscent of the interlocking, network-like behemoths that fostered the original antitrust movement: the railroads, the banks, Standard Oil and U.S. Steel. To Ms. Khan and her colleagues, the threat posed by the new giants requires dusting off old trust-busting strategies. If the neo-Brandeisians get their way, the federal government would challenge more mergers and business tactics and break up more companies.</p><p>But the shift is about more than big tech and tougher enforcement. It's about a change in the underlying philosophy of how Washington has governed corporate America since the 1980s. The new framework is more rooted in social and political goals than economic ones; more focused on the size of companies per se, less on trying to assess whether that size is good or bad for the economy; and more sympathetic to suppliers, small business and workers, even at the expense of consumers.</p><p>Antitrust is a \"philosophical underpinning for structuring society on a democratic foundation,\" Ms. Khan wrote in her 2018 essay. Distrustful of economists and their assumptions, the New Brandeis movement believes, she wrote, that \"there are no such things as market 'forces.'\"</p><p>The resuscitation of Brandeis and his ideas is intended as a symbolic toppling of the scholar whose work defines the prevailing economics-focused, market-trusting approach to antitrust: the conservative icon Robert Bork.</p><p>For all their ideological differences, the two late legal lions -- Brandeis died in 1941, Bork in 2012 -- were similar in certain ways. They were both better known for other legacies: Brandeis for helping to create the right to privacy and for the \"Brandeis brief,\" a court filing that supplements legal citations with economic and social data; Bork for pioneering the originalism that still defines conservative legal thought. Both faced contentious Senate nomination fights to get on the Supreme Court. Brandeis won his seat. Bork was rejected.</p><p>Brandeis dubbed himself \"the people's lawyer,\" honing his views as a turn-of-the-century Boston lawyer representing small businesses squeezed by larger competitors. That included a fight against J.P. Morgan's bid to consolidate New England railroads. He advised Woodrow Wilson's 1912 presidential campaign in an election dominated by debate over how to toughen and modernize the seminal Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. (Wilson's campaign had a jingle, \"Bust the Trusts,\" with the chorus \"So we'll have to Bust -- the -- Trusts; Or they'll grind us in -- the -- dust.\") After Wilson's victory, Brandeis worked with the White House and Congress on the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act, which created the FTC.</p><p>In his writings as a Wilson adviser and in his 23 years on the bench, Brandeis laid out two core themes of antitrust. First, the purpose is more about preserving democracy than fostering growth. As Brandeis wrote in a broadside against the big banks, \"Even more important than efficiency are industrial and political liberty.\" Second, as he argued in his 1934 book, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" big business is suspicious in itself, whether economic harm can be proven or not. Brandeis's antipathy to size was also aimed at government, a nuance often overlooked by his current followers.</p><p>His most famous antitrust ruling, in the 1918 case of Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, gave courts wide latitude to police any business conduct suspected of attempting to \"suppress or even destroy competition.\" Brandeis repeatedly sided with small businesses, from ice sellers to lumber mills, even when they tried to band together and collude, as long as they claimed to be preserving a more diversified marketplace against bigger rivals.</p><p>After Brandeis retired in 1939, the baton was picked up by his successor William O. Douglas. In 1948, Douglas issued a landmark ruling restricting vertical integration -- a strategy by businesses to extend market power by controlling suppliers and distributors. He once wrote that \"monopoly power, whether lawfully or unlawfully acquired, may itself constitute an evil . . . even though it remains unexercised.\"</p><p>Congress followed suit by giving antitrust enforcers and judges ever greater power to rein in big business. The 1936 Robinson-Patman Act was designed to protect small retailers from the \"price discrimination\" of larger chains using their size and efficiency to offer cheaper goods. In 1950, Congress passed the Celler-Kefauver \"Anti-Merger Act,\" giving government still more authority to block vertical mergers and cross-sector combinations. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson's Justice Department issued strict merger guidelines indicating that combinations controlling a certain market share would be challenged.</p><p>The 1960s saw new heights of antitrust enforcement -- or, to critics, the depths of a regime untethered from any logic. One of the decade's most controversial decisions was Utah Pie Co. vs. Continental Baking Co. in 1967, which concerned a claim of \"predatory pricing.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a price war launched by out-of-state frozen pie companies against a dominant local supplier in Utah was illegal -- even though the ostensibly injured party retained a 45% market share, its total sales grew, and the local frozen-pie market expanded nearly fivefold, fueled by lower prices.</p><p>\"There is no economic theory worthy of the name\" to justify the ruling, wrote Robert Bork, then a Yale Law School professor. \"There could be no cleaner demonstration than the Utah Pie decision\" that antitrust had become \"essentially anticompetitive and anti-consumer.\" That argument found a receptive audience in the 1970s, a period of runaway inflation, slow growth and rising unemployment. Many economists blamed big government, high taxes and intrusive regulation.</p><p>A group of conservative economists and legal scholars, many associated with the University of Chicago, also criticized antitrust for stifling efficiency-enhancing mergers and business strategies. The most prominent spokesman for the \"Chicago School\" was Bork, a graduate of both the college and the law school.</p><p>Bork's influential writings included a Fortune magazine article titled \"The Crisis in Antitrust\" and his 1978 book \"The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War With Itself.\" At the time, antitrust experts across the political spectrum agreed that enforcement had gone too far and were calling for recalibration. Bork was more ambitious, seeking his own paradigm shift. He had no patience for the Brandeis-Douglas jeremiads on liberty and the threat of bigness. \"The only legitimate goal of American antitrust law,\" he declared, \"is the maximization of consumer welfare.\"</p><p>Bork insisted that a singular focus on consumer welfare was the original intent of Congress and the courts -- that is, in his telling, until Brandeis perverted it. Bork labeled Brandeis's Chicago Board of Trade ruling \"deviant\" and quoted approvingly a Brandeis critic who portrayed the justice as \"an 'activist' prepared to enforce his own views of proper social policy.\"</p><p>Bork's basic view was that antitrust should focus on economics and shed political and social aims. He coupled that framework with a belief in the superior wisdom of the private sector over the public. Attempts by business to gain damaging monopoly power would inevitably be corrected by free markets, he argued, while government intervention to fix perceived problems would cause lasting harm.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
