  "title": "World News:  U.K. Inflation Hits 11.1%, a 41-Year High  ----  By Paul Hannon",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- The U.K.'s annual rate of inflation rose to a 41-year high in October on surging energy prices, underscoring the stubbornness of inflation even with a new government price cap on energy and a looming recession. </p><p>   Consumer prices were 11.1% higher than a year earlier, a faster rate of inflation than the 10.1% recorded in September and the highest since October 1981, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. </p><p>   Energy prices have surged since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Moscow's decision to throttle natural-gas supplies to Europe to undermine Western support for Kyiv. Rising prices have hit consumers and businesses even as economic growth has ground to a halt, with the economy contracting slightly in the third quarter. </p><p>   Inflation has also picked up in other parts of Europe, with German consumer prices rising 11.6% in the 12 months through October. By contrast, the U.S. rate of inflation eased to 7.7% in October from 8.2% in September. </p><p>   Although the number came in slightly above expectations, reaction was muted on U.K. financial markets. Yields on two-year U.K. government bonds, those most sensitive to interest-rate moves, rose around 0.03 percentage point to 3.1%. That is far below their 4.5% peak in September after the release of a now-scrapped government plan to slash taxes and increase borrowing. </p><p>   \"We cannot have long-term, sustainable growth with high inflation,\" said Jeremy Hunt, the U.K.'s Treasury chief. \"It is our duty to help the Bank of England in their mission to return inflation to target.\" </p><p>   Economists say U.K. inflation rates are unlikely to rise much more over coming months, thanks to an energy-price cap announced by the government in September that limited the October rise in home energy prices to 27%, compared with the 80% rise initially announced by the energy regulator in its twice-yearly review. </p><p>   Without the price cap, the ONS estimated that the annual rate of inflation would have been 13.8%. </p><p>   The Bank of England had expected theinflation rate to come in at 10.9%and mark the peak for now,a view officials repeated Wednesday in testimonyto lawmakers. </p><p>   \"It's pretty much flat around this level for another three months, maybe it edges down a bit in the first quarter,\" BOE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said. </p><p>   But inflationary pressures remained strong outside the energy sector, with food prices up 16.4% from a year earlier, the fastest rise since September 1977. The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy and food, was unchanged at 6.5% despite signs of cooling consumer demand. </p><p>   \"While the BOE has been looking to slow or pause its tightening cycle, the data are providing little justification for doing so,\" said Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan, in a note to clients. </p><p>   The price cap was initially intended to remain in place for two years, but Mr. Hunt later said it would run through the end of March. The outlook for inflation beyond that month will depend on how much further support will be made available to households. </p><p>   European governments are providing costly support to households to prevent widespread hardship as higher energy bills make paying for food and shelter more challenging, and to maintain popular approval of their support for Ukraine through sanctions on Russia. </p><p>   The coming winter is shaping up as a difficult moment. Some 1.2 million British households don't have incomes high enough to cover their food, energy and housing costs, according to estimates from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, which expects more than 2.5 million people to turn to food charities during the winter months. </p><p>   More broadly, the surge in energy prices has left U.K. households with less to spend on other goods and services, and contributed to a slight economic contraction in the three months through September. </p><p>   ONS figures released on Tuesday showed that wages in the three months through September were 6% higher than a year earlier, but the faster increase in prices led to a 2.6% fall in inflation-adjusted pay. </p><p></p>",
