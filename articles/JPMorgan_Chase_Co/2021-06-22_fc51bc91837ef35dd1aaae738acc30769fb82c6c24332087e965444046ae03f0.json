  "text": "<p>Shares in Victorian Plumbing have surged a fifth&#xa0;on their first day of trading, valuing the bathroom products group at more than £1bn and marking the largest initial public offering in the history of London's junior market.</p> <p>Founder and chief executive Mark Radcliffe, who raised £212m selling a portion of his own holding at 262p a share described the float as a “landmark day” for the company and said he was pleased with the “strong blue-chip shareholder base”<em>.</em></p> <p>JPMorgan and US investment manager Kayne Anderson Rudnick will be among the group's biggest non-family shareholders after listing.</p> <p>The Liverpool-based company raised just £11.6m in new money, which was used mostly to cover the costs of the flotation. But its £850m market capitalisation upon admission was enough to seal its place as the largest company to list on the Alternative Investment Market.</p> <p>Shares climbed as much as a quarter to 329p before falling back to 321p in late afternoon trade on Tuesday.</p> <p>Victorian Plumbing was founded in 2000 and has a share of about 14 per cent share of the £1.2bn market for sanitary ware and accessories in the UK, making it the largest online participant. </p> <p>Like other companies in the home improvement sector, it has received a boost from the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers spent cash that might once have gone on holidays or entertainment on enhancing their homes.</p> <p>Sales in the six months to March 2021 were £140m, up 45 per cent from the same period in 2020. The company expects revenue growth in the second half of the current year to be a more modest 20 per cent, and just under that level in subsequent years. That compares with growth of more than 30 per cent annually over the past three years.</p> <p>Also on Tuesday, builders' merchant Travis Perkins said full-year operating profit would be “at least £300m” and “materially ahead of market expectations”.</p> <p>It added that strong growth in both domestic and commercial segments had more than offset “well-documented challenges on both inflation and materials supply”.</p> <p>Victorian Plumbing has no stores, preferring to stock a larger range of products at central warehouses and deliver to homes — about 86 per cent of sales are to retail customers, although one of the company's post-listing ambitions is to sell more to trade customers.</p> <p>Radcliffe, whose started his business career <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bda800c6-9c5c-11e7-8b50-0b9f565a23e1\">selling mobile phone accessories</a> on eBay from his parents' garden shed, also wants to widen ranges to include tiling and lighting products and to expand into Europe.</p> <p>Ireland, France, Spain and Germany are the most likely markets, although Kingfisher-owned Screwfix is one of several UK companies that have found the German market hard to crack.</p> <p>Like Made.com, whose shares got off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fda46bfa-dd6a-40ac-a277-8089a65c7d80\">to a disappointing start</a> on the main market last week, Victorian Plumbing points to an increasing willingness on the part of consumers to purchase bulky or big-ticket items online. Ecommerce specialists now account for about 29 per cent of overall spend, second only to the big DIY chains with a 36 per cent share.</p> <p>It too is highly vertically integrated, with three-quarters of sales coming from its own-brand products such as Chatsworth and Arezzo. This makes for higher gross margins.</p> <p>The 42-year-old Radcliffe still owns 45 per cent of the company, with his younger brother Neil holding 9 per cent.</p> <p>GCA Altium acted as nominated adviser to the company, with Barclays and Numis as global co-ordinators and bookrunners.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Victorian Plumbing IPO marks biggest debut on London's junior market' FT.com 22 June.
