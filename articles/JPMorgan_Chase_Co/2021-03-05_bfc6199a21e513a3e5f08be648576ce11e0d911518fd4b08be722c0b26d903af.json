  "title": "Banking & Finance -- Currencies:  Dollar's Strength Stirs Worry Over Recovery  ----  By Paul J. Davies",
  "text": "<p>   The U.S. dollar is confounding expectations that it would fall this year. </p><p>   The greenback is up almost 2% against a basket of other currencies since its low in early January. Its gains are a sign that a coordinated global recovery isn't going as well as hoped, according to investors. </p><p>   That is at odds with the signals coming from stock and bond markets, where investors are betting on an economic rebound as the world escapes Covid-19 shutdowns. It is also at odds with large bets against the dollar in derivatives markets. </p><p>   Some worry that if the dollar keeps strengthening, it could hurt recoveries in emerging markets that rely more on dollar funding. </p><p>   Most investors and analysts have been predicting falls for the dollar against a basket of currencies in the ICE U.S. Dollar Index since the U.S. presidential election in November. Some forecast a drop of 20% or more as investors moved funds out of the relative safety of U.S. markets and bet on recoveries in stocks and other assets elsewhere. </p><p>   But it slid just 3.3% from late November to early January and has risen since. </p><p>   Against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, it is up 4% and 5% respectively this year, which fits with the typical change in currencies when global investors favor riskier assets. However, it is also 1.7% higher versus the euro, which was viewed as likely to be a big beneficiary of the global recovery. Worryingly for some, the dollar has risen strongly against emerging market currencies, like the Mexican peso and Brazilian real. </p><p>   The dollar's bounce is partly down to investors getting ahead of themselves last year, and partly because the recovery is turning out to be more complicated than expected, according to Ken Veksler, chief investment officer of Accumen Management in Amsterdam. </p><p>   \"All the impetus for the weaker-dollar consensus last year was based on Rumsfeldian 'known knowns,' there has been nothing new to keep it going,\" Mr. Veksler said, referring to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's famous dictum on knowledge and uncertainty. \"The reflation trade is alive, but starting to diminish, and Europe is not as healthy as the U.S. because the vaccine rollout is going badly.\" </p><p>   Slow vaccinations for Covid-19 will restrict countries' ability to reopen their economies. The U.S. has administered more than 24 vaccine doses per 100 people and the U.K., nearly 32 doses per 100 people. The European Union has given less than 8 doses per 100 people, according to Our World in Data. </p><p>   Mr. Veksler isn't expecting to see a much stronger dollar from here and thinks the bulk of the weakening has already happened. </p><p>   The dollar's climb could also reflect rising bond yields: The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped more than half a percentage point so far this year, according to Tradeweb. Other countries' yields haven't kept pace, which means dollars become more attractive to hold than those currencies. U.S. yields have increased their difference over Japanese yields by half a percentage point, and over Swiss and German yields by about 0.3 percentage point. </p><p>   Against emerging markets, U.S. yields haven't changed so much. For example, they have lost ground slightly versus Mexican yields. But the dollar has still jumped sharply against the Mexican peso. </p><p>   Some worry about this because a stronger dollar and higher U.S. yields typically mean tighter financial conditions elsewhere in the world. That could restrict recovery in those economies, especially in emerging markets that rely more on dollar-based funding. </p><p>   \"We're watching the dollar,\" said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International. \"If it snaps and strengthens suddenly, then we can see an emerging-market selloff.\" </p><p>   The Federal Reserve has continued to insist that it won't be quick to raise interest rates or cut back its bond buying programs. So loose financial conditions should continue to prevail. </p><p>   Furthermore, as Mr. Ahmed points out, many emerging-market currencies are starting from much weaker valuations, compared with the last time U.S. yields rose sharply in 2013. That means those currencies should be less vulnerable this time around. </p><p>   The benefits to emerging markets from U.S. growth should still be strong overall, according to Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The U.S. economy and U.S. fiscal stimulus will have key global impact because a strong U.S. consumer is usually strong enough to drive global exports,\" he said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
