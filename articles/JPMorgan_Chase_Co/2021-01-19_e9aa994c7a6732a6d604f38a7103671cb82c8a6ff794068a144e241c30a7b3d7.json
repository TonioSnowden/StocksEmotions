  "title": "China Property Firms Wrestle Debt  ----  By Xie Yu and Chong Koh Ping",
  "text": "<p>   China's property developers have a mountain of international debt to refinance this year, and tight lending conditions are raising the risk of defaults. </p><p>   The real-estate firms need to repay up to $53.5 billion of offshore debt this year, a sharp increase from the $25.4 billion that came due in 2020, according to CreditSights, a bond-research firm. The bulk of the debt -- $47.6 billion -- is dollar bonds. The CreditSights figures include maturing bonds and a smaller sum of puttable debt, which has a longer maturity but which investors have the right to sell back during 2021. </p><p>   At the same time, support from China's powerful state banks is waning, profits are still recovering after tumbling in the early phase of the pandemic and regulators are taking a tougher stance on financial risk in the sector. </p><p>   To further complicate matters, international defaults by Chinese borrowers, including some smaller real-estate firms, have grown more common in recent years. And a spate of defaults late last year by state-linked companies rattled investors in China's huge onshore bond market, where property developers are also active borrowers in yuan. </p><p>   While yields are high compared with many other investments, analysts and investors say the market is likely to draw sharp distinctions between healthier and weaker borrowers. </p><p>   \"We are going to see a big, record year this year for dollar-bond issuance by Chinese and Asian issuers, but there will still be a steady pipeline of defaults and names that investors will avoid at any price,\" said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at ANZ. </p><p>   By his tally, about $34 billion of Chinese corporate bonds in dollars were yielding more than 15% as of Thursday, including $25.5 billion of property debt. Mr. Gallimore said it was tough for companies to secure new bond or bank financing when existing yields were above 15%. </p><p>    China Evergrande Group, one of the country's biggest developers and Asia's biggest junk-bond issuer, has nearly $3 billion of dollar debt maturing this year, according to FactSet data. It suffered a bout of market turmoil in September and while its shares and bonds have stabilized, its outstanding dollar bonds yield between 13% and 17%. </p><p>    Shaw Yann Ho, head of Asia fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said financing conditions would further diverge this year for strong and weak players. \"Sentiment has been dampened by more default cases onshore and overall lending to the Chinese property sector has been further tightened,\" she said. </p><p>   Financial regulators late last year told big banks to cap their real-estate exposure, including both mortgages and lending to developers, at 40% of their loan book. That adds to a set of debt metrics dubbed the \"three red lines\" -- widely reported in the Chinese media but never formally confirmed by the authorities -- which essentially require more indebted developers to bring down leverage before taking on new debts. </p><p>   Still, some developers have moved quickly to address their funding needs, as often happens at the start of the year. By Friday, 19 firms had already raised a combined $6 billion through bond sales this year, according to Refinitiv. </p><p>   The amount of orders placed for such deals showed many offshore investors are eager to participate, said Luther Chai, a credit analyst at CreditSights in Singapore. Mr. Chai said some weaker issues with single-B credit ratings -- scores that place them firmly in the \"junk\" category -- had been able to raise funds at cheaper rates than similar deals in the fourth quarter. </p><p>   Some investors say the spreads, or higher yields compared with safe government debt, available on Chinese property bonds make them appealing. \"The spreads available are quite wide for their rating and fundamentals,\" said Paul Lukaszewski, head of corporate debt for the Asia-Pacific region at Aberdeen Standard Investments. \"We're getting paid to take the risk.\" </p><p>   Mr. Lukaszewski said the red lines would mean the stock of debt outstanding from Chinese developers reduced over time, and said his firm was maintaining a good amount of exposure to the sector. </p><p></p>",
