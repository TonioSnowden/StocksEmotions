  "text": "<p>Good morning from my apartment in Brooklyn, where I am ending 2021 as it began: in self-imposed quarantine against rising Covid-19 cases among friends and neighbours. Though the Omicron variant has once again scrambled plans for meetings, matches, and more, this year has still far exceeded many of our tepid expectations.</p> <p>It was Italy's year, securing big wins at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b551ad27-94ec-4d36-aa6e-6f1237c3e6ab\">Euros</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/785500fd-d598-4af0-a70f-7b65356c8aab\">Olympics</a>, Eurovision and The Great British Bake Off. The big loser? The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\">collapsed <strong>European Super League</strong></a>. 2021 ushered in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/447c3300-2fd2-4d70-829a-18b3715be498\">fairer payday</a> for US college athletes, the rise of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ef91ab2-4a9d-4e67-a7a2-2136f174a8b7\">sports NFTs</a> and a new generation of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a794fb5-3bcc-412d-afe6-0db9389b24eb\"><strong>Formula One</strong> fans</a>.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to travel to Beijing in six weeks for what is sure to be an Olympic Games for the ages. Public health permitting, there will be a Super Bowl around the corner, and a football World Cup to round off 2022. For now, thank you for reading this year and we wish you a happy, healthy holiday season. We're taking a break, returning to your inboxes on January 8. See you in the new year — <em>Sara Germano, US sports business correspondent</em></p> <h1>CVC's win is Real Madrid's loss</h1> <p><strong>Real Madrid</strong> may be at the top of the Spanish league. But off the pitch, the country's richest and most successful club has suffered a grievous loss.</p> <p>Last weekend, <strong>La Liga</strong>, the body that runs the top two professional football divisions in Spain, signed a €2bn financing deal with private equity group <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>. </p> <p>The fiercest opposition came from <strong>Florentino Pérez</strong>, the billionaire president of Real Madrid, who offered up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d2e2df-e448-438b-93c6-02fe40d48dc7\">an alternative</a> debt deal. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8017f6fc-67be-4759-aaf1-7d2e495d526c\">37 of 42 Spanish clubs</a> voted in favour of the CVC transaction instead. </p> <p>Real's defeat is hard to overstate. CVC will invest €2bn to partner with La Liga and be entitled to 8.2 per cent of the Spanish league's “commercial profits” — meaning its revenues, minus costs from setting up a new commercial entity — for the next 50 years.</p> <p>Opponents, who also include <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> and <strong>Athletic Bilbao</strong>, are still seeking to block the deal by filing lawsuits. In the meantime, they have received a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/114a8d1d-c9c4-44ca-bdbf-493c74dae310\">carve out</a>. By refusing to take CVC's cash, they won't have to give up any of their share of future La Liga revenues. </p> <p>Here's the thing. CVC still gets what they want most: a stake in the broadcasting rights around Spanish league matches, including those involving Real Madrid. </p> <p>On Monday, La Liga <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spains-laliga-grants-domestic-tv-rights-movistar-dazn-495-bln-euros-2021-12-13/\">sold</a> its domestic broadcasting rights to Spanish TV operator <strong>Movistar</strong> and streaming service <strong>DAZN</strong> in a deal worth €4.95bn over five years. </p> <p>That's an increase on the value of the rights per season it earns from the existing three-year deal with telecoms group <strong>Telefónica</strong> worth €2.94bn. The continued attractiveness of La Liga's screening rights is down to, in large part, fans wanting to watch top sides like Real Madrid.</p> <p>The new TV deal provides CVC with early returns, but the true goal is for a bumper payout in future. The private equity group also typically views its investments over a 10-year period, seeking to grow the companies they acquire or partner in, then sell out at a higher price than they bought in.</p> <p>Real Madrid is staying away from the CVC deal, partly because it wants to launch a <strong>European Super League</strong>. But with most other top clubs backing off from that radical project, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6b63d63-e61d-4187-bad1-b5f399895a88\">legal disputes</a> around the Super League likely to rage on for months if not years, it doesn't look likely to come to fruition any time soon.</p> <p>Until then, Real Madrid will continue to play in — and seek to win — La Liga. Much to CVC's benefit.</p> <h1>The challenge of better pay in tennis</h1> <p>Tennis is among the most watched sports in the world, with over a billion fans globally. But vast inequities in how its best players are compensated could be a roadblock in the future growth of the game. </p> <p>This year, as the sport rebounded from cancelled or postponed tournaments, leaders began to reimagine payment plans for hundreds of tour members, many of whom barely earn enough to cover costs.</p> <p>“When I ask players, how much money do you have to make to [cover costs], most of them come up with $100k to $150k,” <strong>Billie Jean King</strong> told Scoreboard in our film on the business of tennis, which is well worth a watch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3696a047-5aa9-469d-9c78-9ddb875ff993\">here</a>. “That's a lot of money”.</p> <p>Data from the <strong>ATP </strong>and <strong>WTA </strong>tours show median prize money for men and women, respectively, stood at $137k and $92k in 2021. That's a far cry from this year's earnings of the tours' top players, <strong>Novak Djokovic</strong> ($9.1m) and <strong>Ashleigh Barty </strong>($3.9m), from tournament winnings alone.</p> <p>Three of the sport's four “Grand Slam” tournaments — <strong>Wimbledon, </strong>the <strong>US Open</strong>, <strong>French</strong> <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Australian Open </strong>— have boosted prize money paid to players who compete in the events' earlier rounds as of this year. Still, further efforts could be made for a more sustainable tennis ecosystem.</p> <p>One long-rumoured option is for a merger of the men's ATP and women's WTA tours, something King said she hopes for. </p> <p>Current circumstances could change that calculus. The WTA <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c827fb41-e5fe-49cf-a31c-aa99b4a56d2e\">plans to suspend</a> hosting tournaments in China over the case of <strong>Peng Shuai</strong>, who in November accused a former top Communist Party official of sexual assault.</p> <p>That translates to roughly 10 of the WTA's 50 annual events being shifted around the globe. A unified global tennis tour would not only have to agree on finances and player pay, but a shared view over geopolitics.</p> <p>For now, the sport must try to match its popularity with securing greater income. Despite being the most-watched sport after football, cricket and hockey, tennis accounted for just 2 per cent of global sports media rights of $44.6bn in 2020, according to SportBusiness. The switch to streaming platforms could mean tour and tournament organisers demand more from media partners.</p> <p>Up and coming players say they sometimes struggle to see past the financial hurdles of staying in the sport. “It's hard to not get consumed by thinking about prize money a lot,” said&#xa0;<strong>Alicia Barnett</strong>, ranked 611 on the WTA singles tour. “But at the end of the day you have to go to a tournament and realise you're investing in yourself and investing in your tennis.”</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Uefa</strong>, European football's governing body, has chosen US bank <strong>Citigroup</strong> to spearhead a relief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a79b68-ba14-466a-bffd-fcda2a1103a7\">package</a> worth up to €7bn for the continent's clubs, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposed funding is designed to assist teams that have lost a collective €9bn of revenues during the pandemic.</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>Premier League</strong> faced calls to enforce a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ede75216-a919-4e32-bff4-5e528c50b533\">firebreak</a>” as Covid outbreaks at several clubs led to a series of matches being postponed this week. The body that runs English football's top tier is resisting a wider shutdown of fixtures, having already lost £2bn in revenue due to the lack of ticketing income and rebates paid to broadcasters in the pandemic.</p></li>  <li><p>Former <strong>New York Yankee</strong> star <strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b7ae6dc-b213-4463-b980-3b0401087187\">at the center of</a> a bitter client poaching row at <strong>JPMorgan</strong>, revelations from a restraining order filed by one of the bank's wealth advisers against the firm. </p></li>  <li><p>Victims of disgraced former <strong>USA Gymnastics </strong>doctor <strong>Larry Nassar</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nassar-victims-reach-380-million-settlement-with-usa-gymnastics-and-u-s-olympic-and-paralympic-committee-11639406377\">reached a landmark $380m settlement</a> with the governing body this week, one of the largest payments ever recorded for victims of sexual abuse.
