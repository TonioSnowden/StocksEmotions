  "text": "<p>Before that, Ms. Choi spent nine years at the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, where she was an assistant U.S. attorney and a cybercrime coordinator focused on network intrusions, digital currencies, the so-called dark web and national-security investigations.</p><p>She served as lead prosecutor in a number of high-profile cases, including a hack of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and other financial institutions by a transnational organization and the operation of an unlicensed virtual currency exchange, Coin.mx, the Justice Department said.</p><p>Ms. Choi said in a statement that the Justice Department \"has been at the forefront of investigating and prosecuting crimes involving digital currencies since their inception,\" adding, \"The NCET will play a pivotal role in ensuring that as the technology surrounding digital assets grows and evolves, the department in turn accelerates and expands its efforts to combat their illicit abuse by criminals of all kinds.\"</p><p>The NCET—overseen by Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal division—will focus on crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges and mixing and tumbling services, and will help trace and recover assets lost to fraud and extortion, according to the Justice Department.</p><p>\"Eun Young is an accomplished leader on cyber and cryptocurrency issues, and I am pleased that she will continue her service as the NCET's inaugural director,\" Mr. Polite said in a statement.</p><p>Edward Imperatore, a partner in the investigations and white-collar defense practice at law firm Morrison &amp; Foerster LLC who worked alongside Ms. Choi in the Southern District of New York, lauded her broad experience prosecuting complex financial crimes.</p><p>Mr. Imperatore said Ms. Choi began as cybercrime coordinator for the Southern District during a period when the office was under scrutiny for the ways it obtained and reviewed electronic evidence. While there, she helped to standardize the way the office used its investigative tools \"and helped to write the blueprint for how to effectively investigate cybercrime and obtain electronic evidence,\" Mr. Imperatore said. \"She will be very adept also at standardizing the way that cryptocurrency is investigated and prosecuted across the country.\"</p><p>Additionally, she will likely focus on following the money in her new role, said Mr. Imperatore, \"which is going to be a priority for the Justice Department more broadly in doing crypto investigations.\"</p><p>Ms. Monaco in October announced the creation of NCET to investigate and prosecute criminal misuses of cryptocurrency and to recover the illicit proceeds from these crimes.</p><p>The Justice Department also said Thursday that it was forming a dedicated unit within the Federal Bureau of Investigation for cases involving cryptocurrency.
