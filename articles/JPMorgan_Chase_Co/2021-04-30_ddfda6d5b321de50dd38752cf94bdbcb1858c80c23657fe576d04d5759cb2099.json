How well did you keep up with the news this week? </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-04-30/\"><em>Take our quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>The US economy recorded the fastest first-quarter growth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3250f348-6a58-4a8f-ba79-5556ddfce127\">in almost four decades</a>, the commerce department said on Thursday, helped by significant fiscal stimulus and looser lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>Gross domestic product advanced 6.4 per cent on an annualised basis, topping economists' expectations for 6.1 per cent growth, according to a Refinitiv survey.</p> <p>Joe Biden&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a46b8350-1a15-4975-b4cb-b63c93a5930f\">hailed</a>&#xa0;the country's economic revival this week in an address to a joint session of Congress, declaring America was “ready for take-off” as he appealed for lawmakers to approve his sprawling spending agenda.</p> <p>Jay Powell, the Fed chair, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/296ae4e6-5e4e-44fc-8636-67e2ad38eee4\">acknowledged this week</a> that the US economic recovery had progressed “more quickly than generally expected” but added it remained “uneven and far from complete” and said the central bank was “a long way” from its goals for the economy.</p> <p>US economic growth has accelerated as more Americans are vaccinated against coronavirus and states and cities have begun to relax pandemic curbs. By Thursday the US had administered 234.6m doses, and 98m Americans are fully inoculated — representing 29.5 per cent of the total population.&#xa0;</p> <p>Wall Street welcomed the GDP figures. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd6f7984-2cc0-49dc-bb0b-20e0f1440cb4\">posted another record high</a> and commodities rallied on hopes the recovery was strengthening. The 0.7 per cent increase in the S&amp;P 500 share index took it above the record closing it achieved just two days ago, extending the year-long rally.
