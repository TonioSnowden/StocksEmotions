  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Gazprombank, Key To Energy Exports, Dodges Sanctions",
  "text": "<p>Gazprombank is special. A bank created to serve the financial needs of Russia's Gazprom, one of the largest natural gas exporters in the world, Gazprombank is a vital part of the gas trade. It has also done business with close associates of President Vladimir Putin and has been embroiled in money-laundering troubles in Europe.</p><p>Gazprombank's press office in Moscow didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>European Union diplomats say they kept Gazprombank free from sanctions because payments on gas imports need to keep going.</p><p>The European Union last year imported 45% of its natural gas from Russia, equivalent to around $70 billion last year, according to Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank. EU officials said on Tuesday that they aim to cut that dependency by two-thirds this year, but it will take much longer to end it completely.</p><p>Gazprombank also avoided a ban on Swift, the financial-messaging infrastructure that links the world's banks, which is being cut off for seven other Russian banks. EU and U.S. leaders have also said they are ready to sanction more banks, without specifying which ones.</p><p>Gazprombank picked up the pieces of Russia's banking system before. When Russia's economy crashed in 1998, leading to widespread bank failures, Gazprombank took over most of the gas export contracts with foreign countries, according to its 1998 annual report.That made it a key dealer of foreign currencies and link to the global financial system.</p><p>Gazprombank has correspondent-banking relationships with several Western banks, which enable it to move U.S. dollars, euros and other currencies on behalf of Russian clients. Foreign banks maintain accounts at banks in the U.S. and elsewhere to access those financial systems.</p><p>Listed correspondent banks include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Commerzbank AG. Gazprombank's arms in Switzerland and Luxembourg also have their own correspondent banks. The three also use one another for transactions.</p><p>Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Commerzbank declined to comment on Gazprombank. Deutsche Bank said in general, it may decide not to execute a payment, even coming from a non-sanctioned bank, if it considers it too risky. Bank of New York didn't reply to requests for comment.</p><p>Sparing Gazprombank from sanctions could open the door for the lender to become a conduit for businesses to and from Russia, a way to work around sanctions imposed on peers, according to sanctions consultants. Sanctioned VEB had an 8% stake in Gazprombank as of September, according to Gazprombank's most recent results report.</p><p>\"The point with leaving some banks open now is to allow gas payments to flow. But that also means channels are open for other payments that may not be those intended,\" said Cari Stinebower, a partner at law firm Winston &amp; Strawn in Washington, D.C., and former officer in the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces sanctions.</p><p>\"If you look at Iran and Venezuela, banks have become masterful at setting up front companies and layering transactions so that it is almost impossible to tell who the ultimate beneficiaries of the transfers are,\" Ms. Stinebower added.</p><p>While Gazprom is still its single largest customer, the bank has grown over the years and now has operations touching much of Russia's economy and connecting it to the West.</p><p>In Europe, Gazprombank has offices in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Cyprus where it provides financial services that can link Russian clients to the continent.</p><p>Out of Luxembourg, it offers financing for private jets and yachts, according to its website. Within Russia it is one of the country's largest retail banks, with over 3 million customers.</p><p>The bank is also part of the larger Gazprombank Group that holds assets such as Skoda JS, which produces equipment for nuclear power plants in the Czech Republic, and a Russian media empire that owns major television channels, distribute movies and publishes celebrity magazines.</p>",
