  "text": "<p>   Banks all over the U.S. and around the world have curtailed lending to the U.S. oil-and-gas sector. BOK Financial Corp. has doubled down. </p><p>   The Tulsa, Okla.-based bank holding company for the Bank of Albuquerque, Bank of Oklahoma and Bank of Texas, along with other financial-services companies, is majority-owned by billionaire oilman George Kaiser. It has been snatching market share from big European banks and local rivals that retreated from the industry even as oil prices leapt from historic lows to near-historic highs in less than two years. </p><p>   \"We're demonstrating that we can be very aggressive,\" said Stacy Kymes, BOK's chief executive officer. \"Some have struggled with underwriting and managing the credit risk.\" </p><p>   The outlook for energy companies today is much better than in the depths of the pandemic, when an oil glut depressed prices, drivers stayed home and airlines grounded flights. </p><p>   Demand has returned. Oil is now in short supply, a dynamic worsened by international sanctions on Russian oil following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices have jumped, reaching multiyear highs around $100 a barrel, and so have the prospects of energy providers. </p><p>   BOK was bookrunner on $2 billion in loans to U.S. oil-and-gas companies during the first quarter of this year, representing 6.7% of lending in the sector, according to data provider Refinitiv. The bank ranked fifth overall, behind national giants Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.., and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. </p><p>   Energy loans make up about 15% of the bank's total book. </p><p>   The lender added 19 new borrowers during the quarter, as others backed away because they were trying to limit exposure to carbon-producing industries, said Mr. Kymes during an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday. </p><p>   This year's lending builds on last year, when BOK was 11th in oil-and-gas loans. Its 2.8% market share was the bank's highest yet. </p><p>   The bank's run up the league tables has come as overall energy lending has fallen. Last year's $143.7 billion in U.S. oil-and-gas loan financing was the third-lowest total in the past 10 years, higher only than 2020, the year the pandemic began, and 2016, after oil prices had collapsed from their 2014 highs,according to Refinitiv. Companies raised $219.9 billion by selling bonds last year, a 30% drop from 2020. </p><p>   This year, high oil prices have boosted energy companies' cash flows, so they don't need to borrow as much. Many U.S. producers have said they don't intend to increase production, limiting their need for capital. </p><p>   Banks have also been reducing oil-and-gas lending to reduce their exposure to greenhouse gas-emitting industries. Other lenders have been put off by an extremely volatile oil market that has made it difficult for them to assess risk. </p><p>   Mr. Kaiser's commitment to the industry hasn't helped BOK's share price in the short term. BOK's stock is down roughly 20% so far this year. First-quarter net income was $55 million lower than a year earlier, weighed down by the bank's mortgage-servicing and securities-trading businesses. </p><p></p>",
