  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>After months of denial, central banks now accept that an economic recovery has begun. Interest rates can only rise. This week Norway said it would lift its central rate in September. Even the previously impassive US Federal Reserve has had a rethink. Suggesting that rates could rise in 2023, as opposed to 2024, does not sound particularly hawkish. But expectations — rather than facts — make a market. </p> <p>Central bankers see themselves protecting the integrity of their respective country's currency. In reality, as Alan Greenspan noted in the past, they drive a bus with almost opaque front windscreens, steering with the use of rear mirrors. Oh, and the brakes work poorly, never stopping on time. Understandably, bond markets have all year priced in higher inflation from surging commodity prices and tightening labour supply, sending yields higher.</p> <p>But if inflation concerns have troubled equity investors, you do not see it in the volatility measures that are meant to reflect risk. One of these, America's Vix, has drifted down towards pre-pandemic lows recently. With less contribution expected from bank trading desks in the quarters to come, the bosses of lenders with investment banks have already begun to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32f6f4ce-713a-4027-b194-03ff41e70ff6\">downplay expectations for earnings</a>, notes Lex. </p> <p>Speaking of volatile investments, one thing that banks have not committed to trading are cryptocurrencies. At various times, bank chiefs, such as JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, have decried their use. More importantly, regulators and central banks have also tossed cold water on to the sizzling cryptocurrency griddle. That steams up crypto proponents, already keen to replace fiat currencies.</p> <p>Unusually, El Salvador has adopted bitcoin as legal tender. It seems <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fef6ce3d-cae1-4e99-9cff-c3acff4c6cc8\">unlikely other countries will follow</a> the small Central American nation on this path, thinks Lex. Most big economies such as China and the US worry about the use of these parallel currencies for money-laundering purposes. The parallels end there: authoritarian countries such as China are squashing cryptocurrencies while liberal democracies are inclined to tolerate them.</p> <p>One country that should demand squeaky-clean banking is Iceland. A part-privatisation of Islandsbanki on its local exchange values the lender at $1.2bn. But this was the former Glitnir, which nearly swamped the country's economy in 2008 after much of its loan book went sour. Iceland's tourist board talks up the country's homely virtues, and Islandsbanki <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c15be28-0b71-490d-9799-05cca0d30d6b\">offers a play on those</a>, says Lex, and not the raging speculation in markets elsewhere. </p> <p>Wild bull runs not only improve the lot of investors, but those US chief executives with long-term incentive plans paid in shares. One of these chief executives, Bobby Kotick of video game maker Activision Blizzard, had expected a whopping pay packet of $124m. Shareholders, which have a say-on-pay vote on this year's ballot, gave that package a less than overwhelming seal of approval. All other ballot results at its annual general meeting were reported, but the pay ballot result was delayed. Lex rightly questioned the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7093b27d-73dd-4a21-9475-bf238af87894\">company's motivations</a>. </p> <p>Corporate activism can achieve a positive result for stakeholders. It is most interesting to see the effect of activists on companies. A small one, Bluebell, joined the register some time ago. A larger US fund, Third Point, has come in more recently. Vivendi, controlled by France's Vincent Bolloré, has plans to spin out its Universal Music unit and sell a smaller stake to US investor Bill Ackman. It is messy, but Bolloré may be able to cash out of Universal Music and increase his stake in Vivendi at the same time. Lex thinks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51d945cf-28b9-4d93-9dfb-f602271ef9c1\">activists should chase him on the latter point</a>, as Bolloré may have cleverly sidestepped a requirement to buy out all Vivendi minorities.</p> <p>A different kind of activism, this time from regulators, has arrived with the election of Joe Biden to the White House. In a rare show of bipartisanship, the US Senate approved the nomination of Lina Khan to run the Federal Trade Commission. The 32-year-old Columbia Law School professor has spoken in favour of breaking apart Facebook, Google and Amazon. Washington's attitude to Big Tech is undergoing a sea change but Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de9787c3-92a5-4de4-8700-90cd1cac6c0c\">does not expect a break-up</a> of these goliaths to follow.</p> <p>This threat is a little more potent for big accountancy firms, at least in the UK. News that PwC plans to expand its headcount by 100,000 worldwide caused some head-scratching at Lex. It means that the Big Four <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d94652ab-6b48-4895-ae37-3c150c118a56\">just keep on getting bigger</a>. Local pressure for break-ups or tougher competition rules are having little effect.</p> <p>As more people return to offices, Lex looks forward to a different break-up, one that presages the weekend ahead. Have fun whatever you do. </p> <p><strong>Alan Livsey<br></strong><em>Lex Research Editor</em></p><p>Source: Alan Livsey 2021 'Best of Lex: inflation predation, bitcoin and Bolloré' FT.com 18 June.
