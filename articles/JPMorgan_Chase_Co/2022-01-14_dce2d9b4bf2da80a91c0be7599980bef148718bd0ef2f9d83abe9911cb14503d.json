Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2022-01-14/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Shares of TPG <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/135f73dd-942d-4380-8332-844ca9a82e50\">jumped 15 per cent on their first day of trading</a> as the private equity group co-founded by billionaires David Bonderman and Jim Coulter became the latest to capitalise on soaring valuations by tapping public markets to finance growth.</p> <p>TPG is the largest company to go public in the US so far this year, and its successful listing comes as the wider IPO market grapples with poor performance and rising volatility.</p> <p>“The markets are turbulent,” TPG chief executive Jon Winkelried told the Financial Times. “This IPO was a high-quality institutional book from a company that's highly profitable and has been around for 30 years.”</p> <p>In going public, TPG is preparing to dramatically expand its platform, which has $109bn in assets, by launching new funds and investment products and striking acquisitions. TPG raised $1bn in the IPO.</p> <p>Bonderman, 79, and Coulter, 62, co-founded TPG in 1992 after cutting their teeth as dealmakers working under Texas oilman Robert Bass. </p> <p>The public listing will also help to cement succession planning from Bonderman and Coulter. Winkelried, who was named sole chief executive in May 2021, is set to join Coulter and Bonderman as a controlling shareholder through a class of supervoting shares.</p> <p><em>Thanks to all our readers who voted in yesterday's poll.

Earlier this week we asked for your thoughts on the stand-off between the west and Moscow. Here are some excerpts from what you have been saying:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Given the historically composite structure of Ukraine, Nato and the EU should begin by publicly recognising the right of parts of Ukraine to seek independence — Hugh Small, England</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>Russia can't win a war against the USA, so it is not in its interest to provoke it. But, if threatened, it may react — Anastase Livieratos, Monaco</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>Russia and Ukraine: Thought Experiment. Imagine it is 1975 and the Cuban Revolution has spread to Mexico which increasingly aligns itself with Moscow. How would the US react? The west is dangerously unimaginative about Russian sensibilities — David D'Avray, Oxford</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>Think of this issue as if Russia or China proposed to form a security alliance with Mexico. The US would not tolerate such a move. Moreover, it's past time that Germany steps up to the task of ensuring European security, instead of its normal appeasement in service to commerce — Peter Ferrara, New York</p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>History informs you must not roll over to bullies. Nato must prepare immediately — Peter Atherton, Manchester, England</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Thanks for all your comments and please keep them coming to firstft@ft.com.</em></p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg  2022 'FirstFT: TPG shares surge on their debut' FT.com 14 January.
