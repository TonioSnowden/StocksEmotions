  "text": "<p>   It is ironic that Jennifer Nason, global chairman of investment banking at J.P. Morgan, is still harping on the false narrative that women need guidance on how to participate in meetings (\"The Zoom Revolution Empowers Women to Speak Up,\" op-ed, July 3). This is both insulting to women and untrue. </p><p>   As a former employee of J.P. Morgan and a former bank regulator, I suggest Ms. Nason expand her horizons -- look around the bank. There is no shortage of women actively participating in meetings. In fact, in some areas of J.P. Morgan, such as compliance, women clearly dominate the conversations. </p><p>   Rantch Isquith </p><p>   Highwood, Ill. </p><p></p>",
