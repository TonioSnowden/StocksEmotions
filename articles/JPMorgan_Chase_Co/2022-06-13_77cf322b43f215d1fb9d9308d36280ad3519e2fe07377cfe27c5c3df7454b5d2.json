  "title": "Morgan Stanley's Gorman Is 'Pretty Relaxed' About Recession Threat; The bank's CEO reiterates at an investor conference that he expects any U.S. downturn to be mild and short-lived",
  "text": "<p>\"We're in a brave new world right now. I don't think anyone can accurately predict inflation one year from now,\" he said at an investor conference. The government said Friday that the consumer-price index hit its highest level since 1981, and U.S. stocks tumbled again Monday, along with cryptocurrencies and other risky assets, to put the S&amp;P 500 in a bear market, as defined by a 20% decline from its Jan. 3 recent high.</p><p>But Mr. Gorman cited a backdrop of strong balance sheets for corporations and consumers as reason to be optimistic that a recession wouldn't be severe or last a long time. And while the stock-market selloff has hampered Morgan Stanley's investment-banking business in the short term, the weak market also is reason not to worry, he said.</p><p>\"We've had plenty of cycles where things look shaky and the market tells a different story,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say I'm totally relaxed, but I'm pretty relaxed.\"</p><p>\"Banking is in a difficult spot right now,\" he said, alluding to this year's slow pace of initial public offerings. \"Is it permanently hit? No. It's delayed. Trading remains active. If trading softens over the next few months, so be it.\"</p><p>He added that the bank's growing business of managing money for wealthy clients is \"incredibly stable.\"</p><p>Mr. Gorman said last month at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit that a mild recession wouldn't surprise him. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon warned this month of an economic \"hurricane\" brewing, while Wells Fargo &amp; Co. CEO Charlie Scharf said in May a recession in the U.S. would be \"hard to avoid.\"</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Morgan Stanley's Gorman Is 'Pretty Relaxed' About Recession Threat</p>",
