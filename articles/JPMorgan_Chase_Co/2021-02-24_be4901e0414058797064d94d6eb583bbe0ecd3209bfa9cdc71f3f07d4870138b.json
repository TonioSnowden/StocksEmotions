  "title": "Key Short-Term Bond Spread Signals Stress",
  "text": "<p>When the coronavirus sent markets and the economy into a tailspin in March, the Fed cut IOER by 1 percentage point to 0.10% -- alongside other interventions -- to shore up short-term lending markets and support economic activity. The spread between IOER and the two-year yield has typically been above 0.05 percentage point since the Fed cut the rate to its lowest ever in March.</p><p>Traders said the shrinking of this spread reflects appetite for short-term debt as investors gobble up safe assets and park their cash. It also highlights a key tension point in financial markets: to what extent is Fed support for markets taking asset prices to unsustainable levels, and how vulnerable does that leave bond markets and other areas exposed to sudden reversals.</p><p>Analysts have been watching Treasury auction results to gauge whether increased fiscal spending and a supply surge of Treasury bonds would push short-term Treasury prices down and yields up.</p><p>So far, that hasn't happened. But bond traders are concerned that inflation could rise in coming months and years as the government prints money to support the economy and cover future borrowing costs.</p><p>Traders contend that short-term yields would be higher if the central bank wasn't anchoring rates. The Fed has been buying $80 billion in Treasurys each month since June and slashed rates to near zero in March to stabilize financial markets.</p><p>The idea is that low interest rates and bond buying boost spending by providing cheap credit to businesses and households. Some bond investors fear too much cheap credit will mean inflation.</p><p>\"What is typically the downside to something that looks perfect? Debt,\" said Kevin Walter, co-head of global Treasurys trading at Barclays. He notes that the Treasury issued more than $350 billion in debt in February, compared with $197 billion a year ago.</p><p>Traders contend Fed policy is helping to artificially hold down rates, leaving Treasury markets vulnerable to a sharp reversal once inflation rears its head.</p><p>Yet inflation is running below 2%, having only rarely exceeded that Fed target in recent years, and the job-market recovery remains middling.</p><p>Another corner of U.S. markets is sending warning signals: The 10-year break-even rate, which tracks annual inflation expectations over the next decade, traded as high as 2.24% last week.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury closed at 1.363% Tuesday, according to Tradeweb -- down slightly from Monday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank remains committed to supporting the economy with near-zero interest rates and asset purchases until the economy has made \"substantial further progress.\"</p><p>The difference between the break-even rate and the Treasury yield recently widened to more than 1 percentage point. For some this is a sign that inflation isn't far off, and that financial markets remain vulnerable to bubbles.</p><p>\"I would characterize the phase we are in now as an era of hyperstimulation between fiscal and monetary policy,\" said Thomas Pluta, global head of linear rates trading at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. \"The byproduct is all this cash sloshing around the system chasing assets like crypto, commodities and meme stocks.\"</p>",
