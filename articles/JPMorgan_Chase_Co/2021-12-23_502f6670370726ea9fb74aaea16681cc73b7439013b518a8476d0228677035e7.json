  "title": "Missing the Mark on Inflation and Build Back Better; What Will Fed's Regulatory Agenda Mean for Banks? What President Biden's Build Back Better bill could mean for inflation has become central to the debate over the spending plan",
  "text": "<p>Now on to today's news and analysis.</p><p>Top News</p><p>Both Manchin and Biden Are Wrong About Bill's Inflation Impact</p><p>President Biden's Build Back Better plan is intended to reshape the role of government in the lives of Americans. Yet whether it passes Congress comes down to a completely different matter: what lawmakers think it will do to inflation, writes WSJ's Greg Ip in his Capital Account column.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither side in this debate gets the impact right. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who opposes the current legislative package, conflates the effect of past and future spending on today's inflation. The Biden administration credits the plan with anti-inflationary effects that independent research doesn't support. Both sides are ignoring simple truths. In the near term, inflation's path will largely depend on whether Covid-related bottlenecks and labor shortages ease or get worse because of the Omicron variant. In the long run, it depends on the Fed.</p><p>Fed's Regulatory Agenda Could Be Swing Factor for Bank Stocks</p><p>Next year, a Democratic appointee is set to once again be leading bank supervision at the Federal Reserve. Times are less tense than under President Obama, when the Dodd-Frank Act was first being implemented and troubled banks were at the center of attention. But that doesn't mean bank investors shouldn't be paying close attention, WSJ's Telis Demos writes in a Heard on the Street column.</p><p>U.S. Economy</p><p>Nation's January Goal: Stay Open, Despite Omicron</p><p>Businesses, schools, hospitals and governments are preparing for a new year with a sense of déjà vu, as the spread of Covid-19's Omicron variant brings a familiar challenge: how best to navigate another surge.</p><p>Christmas Gifts Are Being Delivered, Biden Says</p><p>Biden Extends Student Loan Payment Pause Another 90 Days</p><p>President Biden has extended the pause on student-loan payments another 90 days, to May 1, 2022. \"We know that millions of student-loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,\" the president said.</p><p>Jobless Claims Trending Near Historic Lows Despite Omicron Concern</p><p>New applications for unemployment benefits have been hovering near historically low levels in recent weeks, as businesses hold on to workers amid a tight labor market.</p><p>Consumer Spending Expected to Have Slowed in November</p><p>Consumer-spending growth likely cooled in November, economists say, and risks are now mounting for the broader economy to slow amid the latest wave of Covid-19 cases.</p><p>Confronting Inflation, Biden Administration Turns to Oil Industry</p><p>The relationship between the White House and U.S. oil companies has sunk to a new low at a moment when President Biden needs the industry most. Oil company executives have become openly frustrated with a Biden administration that spent months shunning the industry, only to start urging in recent weeks that it produce more oil to alleviate rising gasoline prices.</p><p>Key Developments Around the World</p><p>European Banks Prepare for Pullback in ECB Stimulus</p><p>Banks in Europe are issuing a particular type of bond in droves, locking in super low borrowing costs ahead of possibly tighter monetary policy in 2022.</p><p>Europe Moves Ahead on Minimum Corporate Tax as U.S. Stalls</p><p>The European Union Wednesday outlined its plans for implementing a global minimum tax rate on corporate profits in 2023 and said it is still confident the U.S. will be able to join it despite a recent setback in Congress.</p><p>Financial Regulation Roundup</p><p>Covid Relief Fraud Potentially Totals $100 Billion, Secret Service Says</p><p>Some $100 billion has potentially been stolen from Covid-19 relief programs designed to help individuals and businesses harmed by the pandemic, the U.S. Secret Service said.</p><p>Hospital Prices Are Unpredictable. One Type of Health Coverage Often Gets the Worst Rates.</p><p>Newly public data show that hospital prices vary in unpredictable ways that seem out of patients' control. A WSJ analysis has identified a kind of health coverage that leaves patients with especially high bills. Hospitals' highest rates often aren't for a specific insurance plan, but rather a type of healthcare provider network that is rented out to other companies. In the complex puzzle of healthcare, rental networks are sometimes used to underpin plans that are barely insurance at all, with limited benefits and capped payouts for care, usually at lower premiums than standard insurance plans.</p><p>Forward Guidance</p><p>Thursday (all times ET)</p><p>8:30 a.m.: U.S. Commerce Department releases November personal income and outlays; U.S. Commerce Department releases November durable-goods data</p><p>10 a.m.: U.S. Commerce Department releases November new-home sales; University of Michigan releases final December consumer sentiment survey</p><p>Friday</p><p>Markets closed in observance of Christmas</p><p>Commentary</p><p>It's Time for the Fed to Go Old School</p><p>The good news is that the Federal Reserve now recognizes that persistent high inflation threatens to overshadow the prospects for real economic growth, Judy Shelton writes for WSJ Opinion. The bad news is that the Fed plans to continue buying Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities while keeping interest rates near zero until mid-March. Staying in monetary stimulus mode is the Fed's way of trying to appease distressed consumers without roiling equity and bond markets. Chairman Jerome Powell last week sought to finesse that delicate trade-off by ratcheting up the rhetoric without taking any specific actions to contract the monetary base.</p><p>Ms. Shelton, an economist, is a senior fellow at the Independent Institute.</p><p>Turkey's Plan to Save the Lira Is a Risky Bluff</p><p>Turkey's plan to bring money back into the lira is a clever appeal to the retail savers now driving the currency's gyrations. If it doesn't work, though, the country's banking system could be compromised, Jon Sindreu of the Journal writes.</p><p>Basis Points</p><p>American consumers felt more optimistic about the economy heading into the last weeks of the holiday season, despite higher inflation and rising Covid-19 case counts. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its consumer confidence index rose to 115.8 in December from 111.9 in November.</p><p>Existing-home sales, which rose in November to the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since January, are on track for their strongest year since 2006 as low mortgage-interest rates and a robust job market drive up demand. Sales of previously owned homes rose for a third straight month in November, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p><p>Central banks will exercise extreme caution before taking their foot off the accelerator, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management, referring to central banks' exit from asset purchases. \"Monetary policy tightening will be gradual, announced well in advance and only in response to strong economic activity,\" chief EMEA market strategist Karen Ward and global market strategist Tilmann Galler say. (DJN)</p><p>The Turkish lira is likely to weaken in coming months despite efforts by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to prop up the beleaguered currency, Commerzbank says. Such measures don't target the root cause of the lira's weakness, which includes \"inadequate\" inflation targeting and \"inappropriate\" monetary policy, Commerzbank currency analyst Tatha Ghose says.
