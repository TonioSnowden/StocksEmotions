  "title": "Tech Stocks Open Lower, Extending Last Week's Losses; Take-Two shares fall on Zynga deal while bond yields keep rising",
  "text": "<p>In individual stocks, Take-Two Interactive fell 10% after the videogame maker agreed to buy Zynga in a $12.7 billion deal. Zynga rose more than 40%. Lululemon declined 8% after saying fourth-quarter earnings would fall toward the low end of forecasts.</p><p>Chip company Nvidia, one of 2021's best-performing stocks, fell 3.7% in brisk trading. GameStop, a favorite among individual traders, lost 5%, having jumped last week after The Wall Street Journal reported that it planned to enter the nonfungible tokens and cryptocurrency markets.</p><p>The tech losses came as the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes—which moves inversely to their price—rose to 1.8% Monday from 1.769% Friday. Friday's closing level was the highest since January 2020, when yields tumbled at the start of the pandemic.</p><p>Rising yields at the start of 2022 have sent a shudder through tech stocks. Pushing yields up are indications that the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates in March and begin to shrink its holdings of bonds and other assets soon afterward.</p><p>Expectations of a reduction in central-bank stimulus have pushed up yields in Europe in recent weeks, too. Among major 10-year government bonds in the region, only German bunds are trading at negative yields, according to Tradeweb.</p><p>U.S. inflation data due Wednesday will be keenly watched as investors seek to predict when the Fed will begin to raise borrowing costs. Monthly consumer prices are expected to have risen more than 7% from a year earlier, for the first time since 1982.</p><p>Later this week, fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off at major U.S. financial firms, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and BlackRock due to file results. Many investors are pushing money into bank stocks, figuring they stand to profit from a rise in interest rates.</p><p>Among them is Hani Redha, a multiasset fund manager at PineBridge Investments. He said the New York-based investment firm has cut its ownership of tech stocks and Treasurys while boosting cash holdings and exposure to financial companies.</p><p>\"Equities are down and bonds are down too,\" Mr. Redha said. \"At least for a while, even cash is better than owning risk assets.\"</p><p>In commodities, U.S. natural-gas prices rose 4.1% to $3.88 per million British thermal units. Cold weather in the Midwest and eastern U.S. early this week will likely boost demand for the fuel, according to analysts at NatGas Weather.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.7%, weighed down by shares of real estate and tech companies. Shares in Atos sank 17% after the French information-technology firm said 2021 results lagged expectations due to project delays and supply-chain challenges.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.1%. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday.</p><p>Mark Andersen, head of asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office, said he favors European and Japanese stocks and shares of energy and financial companies.</p><p>\"It's clear the Fed wants to tighten financial conditions and the means to do that is obviously to get interest rates higher,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Tech Stocks Open Lower, Extending Last Week's Losses</p>",
