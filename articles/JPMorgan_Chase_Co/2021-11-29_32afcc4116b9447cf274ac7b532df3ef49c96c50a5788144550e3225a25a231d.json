  "title": "Jamie Dimon's China Joke Is on JPMorgan's 'Stakeholders'; His kowtow shows that investor value is still paramount—and maybe in this case it shouldn't be.",
  "text": "<p>A day later, evidently alarmed about the potential damage this might do to his bank in China, Mr. Dimon was on his knees. \"I regret and should not have made that comment,\" he said in a statement. A bank spokesman added: \"Dimon acknowledges that he should never speak lightly or disrespectfully about another country or its leadership.\" The Chinese government graciously accepted the double-grovel.</p><p>We can assume the spokesman carefully chose the word \"another,\" since Mr. Dimon has long been a colorfully outspoken commentator on the quality of his own country's leaders. In 2018, he expressed confidence that if he ran for president, he would beat Donald Trump. \"I'm smarter than he is,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"This wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money\"; in contrast with Mr. Trump, \"it wasn't a gift from daddy.\"</p><p>The public self-humiliation of the man who runs America's largest financial institution is instructive for several reasons. For one thing, it suggests the current fad for \"stakeholder capitalism,\" of which Mr. Dimon has been an ardent advocate, has its limits. He was chairman of the Business Roundtable when it issued its sonorously titled \"Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation\" in 2019. Along with 180 other top executives, Mr. Dimon declared the need for \"modernized\" principles by which American companies should live.</p><p>The idea is defined primarily in contradistinction to what has been called shareholder capitalism—the idea, most evocatively articulated by Milton Friedman, that companies' overriding obligation is to maximize returns to their shareholders. The stakeholder crowd believe instead that a company must diversify its priorities: Shareholders are merely one constituency to tend, behind customers, employees, suppliers and wider social, environmental and even cultural duties.</p><p>It's a dubious proposition. In the age of woke tyranny and trial by social media, it always seemed more like a public-relations exercise to appease progressive critics. And Mr. Dimon's obeisances last week prove that for his bank at least, the pursuit of profit is indeed paramount and returns to shareholders must take priority over other interests, such as human freedom and dignity. JPMorgan has a significant business in China and wants more. Under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Xi Jinping, the mere suggestion that the party's role isn't going to be around for ever could prove very costly for the bank's investors.</p><p>But it's a pity that Mr. Dimon so quickly dropped his \"modernized principles\" into the garbage. This might have been one moment when the supposed commitment to wider responsibilities in the world would have been worth displaying.</p><p>Mr. Dimon, to be sure, is only doing what many American business leaders have done for years: lecturing Americans on their flaws while cravenly submitting to China. This may be the first time in history that the leading economic figures in one nation feel it safe and perhaps even obligatory to trash their own country, its leaders and its values while lauding those of its increasingly belligerent adversary.</p><p>There might never have been a time when corporate and cultural leaders have cheerfully exploited the freedoms they enjoy in their own country to help burnish the image and standing of a ruthless and brutal foreign autocracy. There are, however, some relevant historical precedents.</p><p>In 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry dubbed American chief executives who outsourced jobs to China and elsewhere \"Benedict Arnold\" CEOs. He was widely denounced at the time, and back then it was still common to see economic engagement with China as encouraging the country's eventual political liberalization.</p><p>No one has that excuse today. As we observe the full character and ambition of modern Chinese communism—from the brutal suppression of its people's freedoms to the persecution of minorities, from the illegal de facto annexation of Hong Kong to the threats it makes to its neighbors and the increasingly existential menace it poses even to our own way of life—perhaps that Benedict Arnold sobriquet is a freshly apt description of its enablers and apologists in our ranks.</p><p>Jamie Dimon's China Joke Is on JPMorgan's 'Stakeholders'</p>",
