  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- President Biden is expected to nominate Michael Barr, a former Treasury Department official, to a top post overseeing national banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., according to people familiar with the decision. </p><p>   Mr. Barr, who would serve as comptroller of the currency, was assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions during the Obama administration. In that role, he helped craft the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation that followed the crisis of 2008. </p><p>   The White House declined to comment, and the Treasury Department didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   It was unclear when the White House would announce the nomination. </p><p>   The comptroller oversees about 1,200 banks with total assets of about $14 trillion, some two-thirds of the total in the U.S. banking system. It has supervisors stationed inside large U.S. financial firms, making the job one of the most powerful among U.S. bank regulators, which also include the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. </p><p>   Mr. Barr has been critical of the Trump administration's steps to ease rules for big banks. </p><p></p>",
