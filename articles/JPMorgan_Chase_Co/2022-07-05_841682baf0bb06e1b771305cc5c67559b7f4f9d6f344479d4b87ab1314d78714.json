  "text": "<p>   Most post-World War II recessions have been associated with declines in residential home construction, though the hit this time may not be severe because building wasn't as overheated in recent years as it had been in the past. In the first quarter, total U.S. spending on home-building was still 22% below the pace of building at the peak of the housing boom of the early 2000s, according to Commerce Department data. </p><p>    Bruce Kasman, chief economist at J.P. Morgan, predicts a \"bend-but-don't-break\" scenario for the economy, meaning a sharp slowdown in activity that doesn't crack the job market. However, he adds that he doesn't have great conviction about that prediction, given the unusual backdrop and the shocks that keep hitting the economy. </p><p>   Though corporate profits are slowing, he said, corporate profit margins are exceptionally high, historically. At around 18% of sales during the past year, after-tax profits have rarely been higher in post-World War II history. Heading into recessions in 1991 and 2001, firm profit margins had fallen to single digit levels. Firms cut back on spending to build profits, and dragged the economy down in the process. </p><p>   Mr. Kasman said firms now have a large cushion to the growing profit slowdown. Businesses are also swimming in nearly $4 trillion of cash, a record, he said. </p><p>   Slow growth and continued hiring would add up to productivity and profit pressures for many businesses. That would be bad news for stocks, he said. But a recession? He's not counting on it. </p><p>   Households are flush with cash, too. At the end of the first quarter, they had $18.5 trillion in checking accounts, savings accounts and money market mutual funds, according to Fed data. That was up from $13.3 trillion before the pandemic, boosted in part by several rounds of relief checks sent to households in the past two years. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Anthony DeBarros contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
