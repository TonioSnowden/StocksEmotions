  "title": "Amazon to Buy One Medical Network of Health Clinics in Healthcare Expansion; The $3.9 billion deal gives the tech giant a new foothold with companies paying for employee care, physical locations",
  "text": "<p>Amazon.com Inc. is buying an operator of primary-care clinics, a significant expansion that will help the tech giant offer medical services to a large pool of employers and individuals and that underscores its sweeping ambitions in healthcare.</p><p>The $3.9 billion deal, including debt, for 1Life Healthcare Inc., which operates a primary-care practice under the name One Medical, is the first major acquisition announced during the tenure of Chief Executive Andy Jassy, for whom expansion into healthcare is a top priority.</p><p>Amazon will gain access to a practice that operates more than 180 medical offices in 25 U.S. markets and works with more than 8,000 companies to provide health benefits to employees, including with in-person and virtual care. That adds significantly to a smaller service Amazon launched in 2019 and for which it had signed up a limited number of employers in the last year.</p><p>\"We think healthcare is high on the list of experiences that need reinvention,\" said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services. \"We see lots of opportunity to both improve the quality of the experience and give people back valuable time in their days.\"</p><p>The deal adds momentum to the push by technology and retail giants to make inroads into the nation's $4 trillion healthcare economy. That push, along with new technology and medical discoveries, has fueled growth of medical care outside of hospitals and patients now more regularly seek care in more convenient and lower-cost settings. Demand for telehealth during the pandemic increased the use of virtual care.</p><p>Yet the healthcare industry, which is governed by state and federal regulations and an array of companies and providers operating in myriad ways, has proven notoriously difficult to disrupt. An earlier attempt to expand into healthcare, a joint venture set up by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. called Haven, fizzled after three years. The three companies spent roughly $100 million but struggled to manage fundamental issues related to the cost of healthcare, data and staff turnover.</p><p>Once the deal closes, One Medical Chief Executive Amir Dan Rubin will remain as CEO of the business.</p><p>The deal price marks a roughly 77% premium, based on where shares of 1Life Healthcare closed on Wednesday. Based on a recently disclosed share count, the deal would be worth about $3.5 billion excluding debt.</p><p>Shares of 1Life Healthcare rose about 69% to $17.25 on Thursday. Amazon shares rose 1.5% to $124.63.</p><p>Amazon this past April posted its first quarterly loss in years, and the company has faced slowing growth in its e-commerce business, prompting Mr. Jassy to pare back its head count and logistics footprint. Amazon this year also closed down dozens of its bricks and mortar stores, though it also launched a clothing store in California.</p><p>Mr. Jassy, who built Amazon's cloud business into a profit machine and a fixture of internet infrastructure, has made healthcare a primary focus since he took over for Jeff Bezos last year. Mr. Bezos remains as chairman. In addition to scrutinizing Amazon's online shopping and logistics operations and healthcare, Mr. Jassy is also keenly interested in its advertising business, which has emerged in recent years as a multibillion-dollar business as well.</p><p>The company isn't always successful in the businesses it enters, such as with a doomed 2014 smartphone or \"pop up\" stores in malls that it eventually closed. Yet even if one attempt fails, Amazon often seeks another means for successful expansion. A food-delivery service, Amazon Restaurants, was shut down in 2019, but the company earlier this month announced an investment and partnership with delivery service Grubhub.</p><p>Healthcare is another area where Amazon has had successes and failures, but company executives are determined to continue seeking expansion opportunities, as it remains one of the few industries that is less susceptible to recession.</p><p>Amazon has had difficulty expanding the Amazon Care service beyond its own employee network in part because it is a new player in a healthcare space with many established relationships. The company declined to comment on the difficulty to expand.</p><p>Launched in 2019, Amazon Care expanded from a service offered to employees in Washington state to a health service with telemedicine components that the company is seeking to provide throughout the U.S. Amazon has said it has signed several agreements with companies to offer the service to their employees, in addition to its own workers.</p><p>Amazon Care aims to provide a service that can begin in an app with a chat, continue with a virtual visit with a healthcare professional and even include a home visit within an hour after a user connects with the service. It can end with the delivery of prescription medication to a patient's home, Amazon executives have said.</p><p>The tech company has also launched its own pharmacy business after buying online pharmacy PillPack Inc. about two years ago.</p><p>The most expansive version of Amazon Care isn't yet available over all the U.S. The company said the telehealth component would be available nationwide last summer, and in-person care would be available in cities such as Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.</p><p>Employers have embraced digital startups and new virtual and retail settings, in their efforts to better manage costly healthcare benefits for workers. Businesses also see the new options as attractive to workers, potentially boosting retention, said Nathan Ray, head of healthcare mergers and acquisitions at Chicago-based consulting firm West Monroe Partners LLC.</p><p>More broadly, primary-care ventures that pair virtual and physical locations have seen robust investment in recent years to meet the demands of younger, tech-savvy consumers and the needs of an aging population, Mr. Ray said.</p><p>One Medical is among the companies seeking to disrupt primary care, with a recognizable presence in major U.S. metropolitan areas, such as New York, and whose other major competitors, such as Oak Street Health Inc., mostly serve Medicare patients, said Brian Tanquilut, a Jefferies LLC healthcare analyst.</p><p>\"Amazon's buying a physical footprint,\" Mr. Tanquilut said.</p><p>The San Francisco-based company sought to position itself as a convenient and flexible option for patients and employers who offer healthcare benefits to workers. One Medical has a concierge-like model with virtual medical visits, wellness-coaching apps and in-person visits. The company sought to expand its reach with its 2020 launch of a nationwide virtual option and a 2021 acquisition of Iora Health, a primary-care company for patients in Medicare, the publicly funded insurer for seniors and the disabled.</p><p>One Medical has burned through cash, however, as it expanded that footprint, he said, pouring money into new locations and hiring and absorbing operating losses as clinics start up.</p><p>It faced a Congressional investigation last year into its handling of Covid-19 vaccine distribution that concluded the company used \"its access to scarce coronavirus vaccines to promote the company's business interests and push vaccine seekers toward paying for One Medical memberships,\" and that One Medical employees prioritized immunization for relatives and friends.</p><p>As part of the deal between Amazon and One Medical, the private-equity firm Carlyle Group Inc., which made a minority investment of up to $350 million in One Medical in 2018, would exit its position in the company, according to a person familiar with the investment. The investment was made before 1Life Healthcare's 2020 initial public offering.</p><p>Will Feuer contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.com and Sebastian Herrera at Sebastian.Herrera@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon to Buy One Medical Network of Health Clinics in Healthcare Expansion</p>",
