Strong labor market a bulwark against recession</p><p>\"Job gains in June slowed modestly month-over-month but were much better than expected,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in an emailed note Friday.</p><p>\"It's worth emphasizing that employment is generally a lagging economic indicator so this morning's report does not eliminate the risk of a recession starting soon,\" he said. \"However, with labor demand still near record highs, this does suggest that the next economic downturn could be a relatively mild one for workers.\"</p><p>Friday's job's report also showed average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in June, slowing from a 0.4% rise the prior month, according to Kelly. On a year-over-year basis, the rise in pay slowed to 5.1% in June, from 5.3% in May.</p><p>\"Wage growth continues to cool modestly,\" he said.</p><p>All three major stocks benchmarks are heading for weekly gains, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way up.

Nothing else really changed,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in comments to MarketWatch.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index has booked four consecutive days of gains this week, its best winning run since the end of March. If stocks finish higher today, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite would achieve their longest winning streak since November.</p><p>Read: Markets signal recession threat: Why stocks are taking it in stride — for now</p><p>Still, the S&amp;P 500 is down more than 18% since the start of the year, as investors await the bulk of company's second-quarter earnings reports in the coming weeks.</p><p>\"I think it's going to be tough,\" said George Cipolloni, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, by phone Friday. \"This could be the first quarter where you see the brunt\" of commodity-price and shipping-cost pressures on companies' profit margins, he said.</p><p>In his view, earnings estimates are \"too high,\" which may lead to a further decline in the stock market. \"We could potentially get one more leg down,\" said Cipolloni.</p><p>Single-stock movers</p><p>* Caesars Entertainment Inc.
