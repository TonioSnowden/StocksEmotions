  "title": "OPEC, Allies Keep A Lid on Oil Output",
  "text": "<p>The agreement, reached Thursday after an online meeting between the Saudi Arabia-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, is the cohort's latest shift in a sometimes careening debate over how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting the global economy and, by extension, oil demand.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Saudi Arabia and Russia were considering a different proposal to boost output, according to people familiar with the matter. Saudi Arabia has been separately planning to ease in the coming months a unilateral production cut made public in January, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. The kingdom said Thursday that it would keep those cuts in place, at least through April.</p><p>For the better part of a year, OPEC delegates have tried with limited success to gauge the pandemic's effect on demand. In a series of meetings at the end of last year and early this year, they have zigzagged between optimistic forecasts that they said merited more output and dire warnings over continued lockdowns that require reining in production.</p><p>Under the agreement reached Thursday, most members of what is known as the OPEC-plus, or OPEC+, alliance agreed to keep their output unchanged, with small exceptions for Russia and Kazakhstan, amounting to about 150,000 barrels a day combined. That brings the group's overall agreed cuts to 6.9 million barrels a day, down from more than nine million barrels a day at the start of the crisis.</p><p>The move is a victory for Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman, who has consistently urged caution on the pace of a global recovery from the pandemic, while also periodically accommodating Russia's eagerness to open taps wider on any sign of recovery.</p><p>\"We are not fast, we are not furious, we are cautious,\" he said after the meeting Thursday.</p><p>Russia, by contrast, has continuously expressed more upbeat views and pushed for production increases. \"If we look at the situation, it is much better than a year ago, [or] than it was in the fall,\" Energy Minister Alexander Novak of Russia said Wednesday, according to delegates attending.</p><p>In an illustration of the fast-changing assessment within the group, Riyadh and Moscow had earlier Thursday debated a separate scenario bringing back one million barrels of oil a day, according to officials familiar with the discussions. Saudi Arabia would have contributed half of that fresh production, while OPEC+ countries would pump the remainder under the proposal. In the end, though, Prince Abdulaziz convinced his counterparts to mostly hold pat, in part by granting Moscow a small exemption from the curbs, delegates said.</p><p>Prince Abdulaziz told delegates that Saudi Arabia agreed not to roll back its own cuts -- a move that might have softened oil prices -- as a reward for OPEC+ members that he said didn't cheat and overproduce amid earlier agreements, delegates said. Such cheating has undermined previous deals.</p><p>Another dynamic: Saudi officials believe the kingdom is better able to hold its own against the U.S.'s shale-oil producers, which were laid low by the pandemic price crash. These producers traditionally have been able to increase production quickly once prices rebound, threatening global market share.</p><p>Christyan Malek, head of oil-and-gas research at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., said the Saudi decision indicates Riyadh's confidence that U.S. shale companies for now can't take advantage of the price rally, especially after being hit by a winter storm that knocked out some 2.5 million barrels a day of production in Texas and one million barrels a day in other oil-rich states. Mr. Malek said OPEC+ restraint is bringing \"prices to a point where the Saudis are back in control.\"</p><p>In recent months, similar OPEC+ meetings have been contentious, and negotiations have remained fluid through days of talks. Saudi Arabia surprised markets -- and other delegates -- at the end of an OPEC+ meeting in January with a decision to slash its production by one million barrels a day through the end of March.</p><p>OPEC+ cuts have helped bring international oil prices back above $60 a barrel for the first time in a year. Demand has picked up, too, especially in Asia and particularly in China, which has recovered more quickly than other regions from the economic fallout from the pandemic.</p><p>OPEC expects world oil consumption to rise by 4.72 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with the first three months of the year. The International Energy Agency said last month that a recovery in demand would outstrip production in the second half of the year, prompting \"a rapid stock draw\" and erasing the glut of crude that has built up since the pandemic began.</p>",
