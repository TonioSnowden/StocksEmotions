  "text": "<p>Russia made good on payments to foreign bondholders, according to investors and traders, averting default on its foreign debt in the face of the war in Ukraine and punishing Western sanctions.</p><p>Holders of two Russian dollar bonds said coupon payments arrived Thursday, a day late, but well within the 30-day grace period granted under the terms of the bonds.</p><p>The bond payments are a sign that exceptions the West put into sanctions to allow certain transactions, including for debt payments and energy, are working in some cases. Still, financial institutions are reluctant to touch Russian money without strong assurances that what they are doing is legal, leading to delays and confusion.</p><p>Russia's Ministry of Finance said in a statement earlier Thursday that it had remitted payments to a correspondent bank and would provide future updates on whether funds had reached a London branch of Citigroup Inc., which processes payments on behalf of bondholders. Russia's finance minister has said he wasn't sure if the payments would go through, blaming U.S. sanctions for setting the country on the path toward default.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is the correspondent bank that links the Central Bank of Russia to Citigroup. According to a source familiar, JPMorgan received the full $117 million transfer for both Russian sovereign bonds' coupon payments and made the transfer to Citigroup.</p><p>The Treasury Department has said that current U.S. sanctions don't prohibit Russia from making debt payments.</p><p>Prices on the bonds rallied Thursday on hopes that the payments would go through. Russia's bonds maturing in 2023 were quoted around 41 cents on the dollar Thursday, compared with 27 cents Wednesday, according to AdvantageData. Those maturing in 2043 were bought and sold for around 32 cents Thursday, up from about 22 cents Wednesday. They traded above 100 cents on the dollar before the war.</p><p>Russian credit default swaps, which would pay out a windfall if Russia defaults, also rallied on news of the payments. The cost of a five year CDS contract dropped to 41% of the total value of the debt to be insured, compared to as high as 60% as of Tuesday, according to data from ICE Data Services.</p><p>â€”Matt Wirz, Alexander Saeedy and Anna Hirtenstein contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Russia Averts Default After Investors Receive Foreign Debt Payments</p>",
