The launch</h1> <p>At 11.10pm UK time on Sunday, the leaks were confirmed. A dozen of the world's most storied football clubs announced they would launch the European “<strong>Super League</strong>”. The rebels included; Spain's <strong>Real Madrid</strong>, <strong>Barcelona</strong> and <strong>Atlético Madrid</strong>; England's <strong>Manchester United</strong>, <strong>Manchester City</strong>, <strong>Liverpool</strong>, <strong>Arsenal</strong>, <strong>Chelsea </strong>and <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong>; and Italy's <strong>Juventus</strong>, <strong>AC Milan</strong> and <strong>Inter Milan</strong>.</p> <p>They would be among 15 permanent members of a 20 team annual contest that was underpinned by €3.25bn in debt underwritten by <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>. The plan was aimed at torpedoing the <strong>Champions League</strong>, currently the continent's top contest.&#xa0;</p> <p>It would also shatter the football “pyramid”, through which strong performances in national leagues gave any team a shot at the most glittering prizes. Instead, the biggest clubs would be guaranteed their places in the Super League each season. The radical vision of billionaire club owners was aimed at upending the sport's existing power structures. Game on.</p> <p><em>Read the initial report: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cbef20a-7599-4580-82aa-2af383bd0f5a\"><em>Breakaway dozen European football clubs sign up to Super League</em></a></p> <h1>2. The backlash</h1> <p>Condemnation was swift and unrelenting. A lengthy on-air rant by <strong>Gary Neville</strong>, the ex-Manchester United player turned television pundit, went viral. “It will change football in this country forever, forever, and we have to now mobilise, organise,” he urged. Fans duly protested, unfurling banners outside stadiums reading: “created for the poor, stolen by the rich.” Super League clubs were strangely silent.</p> <p>The <strong>European Commission</strong> said it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5101983e-d2ff-4263-94e8-95e498e64dd0\">wouldn't interfere</a> in a sports governance dispute. But keen to chime with their electorates, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7291cf-1225-4127-8972-6e46cc3f1ce1\">politicians across Europe</a> united in condemnation. French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron </strong>welcomed <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong>'s absence from the mutiny. British prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>went furthest, pledging to drop a “legislative bomb” to stop English clubs in the breakaway.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Read the </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e42b84e8-91f3-4642-9306-fe81552453fe\"><em>editorial board's view</em></a><em>: “The future of top-flight football should be decided not by politicians but by players, clubs, managers, if necessary the courts, and above all the fans.”</em></p> <h1>3. The back-stabbing</h1> <p>There were claims of treachery between European football's key power brokers. Hearing whispers of an impending announcement, <strong>Aleksander Ceferin</strong>, president of <strong>Uefa</strong>, the European governing body, rang a close ally, <strong>Andrea Agnelli</strong>, scion of the Italian billionaire industrialist family that owns <strong>Juventus</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>“[Agnelli] said these are only rumours and then he said I'll call you in one hour,” Ceferin told a press conference on Monday. “He turned off his phone. The next day, we get the announcement . . . I've never seen a person who would lie so many times, so persistently [as] he did. It was unbelievable.” A representative for Agnelli declined to comment.</p> <p><em>Read the analysis</em>: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa8ca103-515a-42d7-8acf-81527114f552\"><em>Super League rebels shift the goalposts of European football</em></a></p> <h1>4. The money</h1> <p>The Super League wanted to reshape the finances of elite clubs. In a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f00bb232-a150-4f7d-b26a-e1b62cd175c3\">front page report</a>, the FT revealed that the 12 teams which signed binding agreements to join were promised a “welcome bonus” worth €200m-€300m each.&#xa0;</p> <p>JPMorgan's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c725dc42-6fd1-4bfa-82fc-6d2ed899990b\">debt financing deal</a> was amortised over 23 years and secured against future broadcasting rights which were projected to raise €4bn a year. The rebel clubs also agreed to pay €264m a year to pay down the debt, a figure that includes a 2-3 per cent interest rate. The Super League also agreed about €400m in “solidarity grants'' to smaller teams.</p> <p>The context behind the deal? “Clubs across Europe have suffered steep revenue shortfalls owing to the pandemic, raising concerns over the sustainability of their business models and complicating any plans for new signings. The timing also coincides with a period that has seen the valuations for top-tier franchises grow rapidly, prompting questions over where these clubs would find new sources of revenue.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Read the exclusive: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f00bb232-a150-4f7d-b26a-e1b62cd175c3\">Super League clubs net €200m-€300m ‘welcome bonus'</a></p> <h1>5. The Americans</h1> <p>Leaked documents revealed the Super League's effort to more closely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8199dc2d-9b20-440e-8b1b-861dfc9f1cd4\">resemble the structure</a> of top US sports competitions, including revenue-sharing agreements and cost-control measures designed to prevent spiralling spending on player wages.&#xa0;</p> <p>While the details are illuminating, the broad concept should be no surprise. Many of the Super League's adherents, such as Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal have US billionaire owners who also control sports teams stateside. Their American franchises earn reliable revenues and regular profits by playing in “closed” leagues.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Read the scoop: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e80299a4-8012-447a-8512-c24e149304b1\"><em>Leaked Super League plans reveal goal of US-style football finances</em></a></p> <h1>6. The collapse</h1> <p>By Tuesday night, the pressure from fans, governing bodies and politicians reached boiling point. Over the course of a few chaotic hours, all six English clubs pulled out. Manchester United's executive vice-chair <strong>Ed Woodward</strong> resigned. The next day, Atlético Madrid, Inter Milan and AC Milan withdrew. Only Real Madrid and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46cc7a08-95c9-44c3-9aea-136ca3ae80b5\">Barcelona remain committed</a> to the project. Even JPMorgan would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc927efb-1b05-4f2c-947d-a3832bfe7b36\">express regret</a> for backing the idea.</p> <p>Liverpool's US owner <strong>John Henry</strong> said: “I want to apologise to all the fans and supporters . . . for the disruption I caused over the past 48 hours.” Other club owners issued similarly grovelling apologies.</p> <p><em>Read the report: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3ab9f68-65b2-4839-96b3-ec4d2928053b\"><em>Super League plan collapses as more clubs pull out</em></a></p> <h1>7. The penalties</h1> <p>The Super League's creators wanted to make it hard to leave. Leaked documents detailed the unprecedented attempts to lock teams into the tournament for many years through punitive “exit clauses”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The clubs agreed not to abandon their new competition before June 2025. They would have been liable to pay back money received from an initial “infrastructure grant” worth €3.25bn, as well as a large proportion of broadcast revenues received from playing in the tournament. The problem? Money had yet to flow to the clubs because the Super League collapsed so quickly, so any liabilities for withdrawing are unclear.</p> <p><em>Read the scoop: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b5f6f0d-2fa7-4fba-9ecb-89276b96d116\"><em>Clubs signed up to punitive exit clauses for Super League</em></a></p> <h1>8. The architect</h1> <p>The Super League was the brainchild of <strong>Florentino Pérez, </strong>the billionaire Spanish industrialist and president of Real Madrid. The 74-year-old isn't used to losing. Under his presidency, Real Madrid has won five of its record thirteen Champions League titles. Pérez's strategy of locking in big, recurring revenues may be applicable elsewhere, with his Spanish construction group <strong>ACS </strong>bidding to acquire Italy's biggest motorway network for €10bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>A FT profile of the businessman explains: “For decades, Pérez has been one of Spain's biggest power brokers, because of his overlapping roles in business and sport. Long before his arrival, the box at Real Madrid was where the country's executives and politicians struck their deals. The club is so close to the heart of the ruling elite that the former <strong>King Juan Carlos</strong> used to begin meetings with ministers by discussing its latest results . ..</p> <p>“But now, with the Super League seemingly in tatters and the fate of ACS's bid for <strong>Atlantia</strong> yet to be decided, the Madrid boss faces two of his toughest tests yet.”</p> <p><em>Read the profile: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfdbbb9-75e4-4374-8214-977a1ddfce68\"><em>Florentino Pérez: Spain's football king faces his greatest challenge</em></a></p> <h1>9. The fans</h1> <p>Rich, arrogant owners had taken on their fanbases — and lost. FT columnist Simon Kuper longs for the days when owners were barred from profiting from their investments and clubs did not consider themselves to be businesses. He laments that those rules were scrapped in the 1980s, a decision that paved the way for the arrival of “cold profit-maximisers” such as the <strong>Glazer family</strong> at Manchester United. </p> <p>Robert Shrimsley, the FT's UK editor-at-large, argued that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c37146af-269a-4f49-8411-43fcba57fa37\">we should enjoy the rare triumph for supporters</a>. But, he added the Super League's failure was in its self-serving nature rather than a true David and Goliath moment. “Indeed, the English football fan is one of the most deluded and over-sentimentalised creatures in modern life,” he wrote. “We are, after all, people who sit in the stands bellowing match tips to world-class athletes: “Come on <strong>Ronaldo</strong>, cross it!”</p> <p><em>Read Robert Shrimsley's column: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c37146af-269a-4f49-8411-43fcba57fa37\"><em>Fans 1, Owners 0: but don't be fooled</em></a></p> <h1>10. The fallout</h1> <p>What happens next? England's <strong>Premier League</strong> is considering new measures to ensure a breakaway cannot happen in the future. Uefa hasn't ruled out sanctions against the rebels. Highly-indebted clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan are teetering. <strong>Javier Tebas</strong>, chief of Spain's <strong>La Liga</strong>, called on clubs to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46cc7a08-95c9-44c3-9aea-136ca3ae80b5\">tighten their belts</a> and stop spending so much on players.&#xa0;</p> <p>Largely overlooked, Uefa rolled out a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49aef25a-a133-4fea-b9db-2f1851273bca\">radical revamp</a> of the Champions League this week, with 100 more matches between top sides. There are ongoing talks to create a joint venture between Uefa and elite teams, given them equal control over future media and sponsorship rights for the competition. The Super League may be dead. But the endgame still has yet more money and power flowing to the biggest clubs.</p> <p><em>Read the FT Big Read: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d?\"><em>‘It was utter chaos': the inside story of football's Super League own goal”</em></a></p> <h1>This week's other highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>International Olympic Committee </strong><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/22/sport/tokyo-2020-olympics-ban-protest-demonstrations-spt-intl/index.html\">upheld a ban on athlete demonstrations</a> and protests, its so-called “Rule 50”, during an executive board meeting this week, though sanctions on violations of the rule are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p></li>  <li><p>Former rower <strong>Anita DeFrantz </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36f22e20-0aa9-4014-9ad6-000fe2588acc\">wrote a column</a> for the FT this week, arguing against a Western boycott of the <strong>Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics</strong> over concerns about the treatment of China's Uyghur minority. The American recalled her unwitting participation in the US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics: “I wondered how my sitting out the games would make any difference to the Soviets' decision to move an army into Afghanistan.”&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>The pandemic challenges facing sports and entertainment conglomerate <strong>Endeavor</strong>, as well as its Hollywood super agent chief executive <strong>Ari Emanuel,</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/ari-emanuel-takes-on-the-world\">subject of a <em>New Yorker </em>deep dive</a> by <strong>Connie Bruck.</strong></p></li>  <li><p>Boisterous promoter <strong>Eddie Hearn</strong> has signed a five-year contract for his <strong>Matchroom Boxing</strong> with sports streaming platform <strong>DAZN</strong>, in a deal worth nine figures, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/news/eddie-hearn-dazn-matchroom-contract-sky/NYr8BZEx52BR\">according to <em>The Athletic</em></a>.
