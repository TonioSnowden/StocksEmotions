  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Sometimes the arcana of bank regulation becomes a matter of market fascination. Often it ends up not being quite as important as everyone had hoped. </p><p>\n  The latest example is whether or not the Federal Reserve will extend an emergency pandemic policy to exclude cash and Treasurys from banks' supplementary leverage ratios, a key regulatory measure. Doing so would give them more capacity to gather deposits and buy government bonds. If the Fed doesn't extend this after it is set to expire on March 31, the argument goes, there might be even more upward pressure on yields in the Treasury market. </p><p>\n  Extending this relief could bring calm to anxious markets, and the Fed may consider it good housekeeping for monetary policy or Treasury-market functioning. But it is unlikely to be a cure for rising rates in general. </p><p>\n  So far, the biggest U.S. banks as of the end of the fourth quarter were operating within their leverage requirements, even without the exemption, and so had room to expand their balance sheets, according to analysts at Wolfe Research. Bank of America said in late February it was still \"well positioned\" and \"could manage\" without an exemption, which it said it hasn't used. Citigroup said that the supplementary leverage ratio \"would not become binding for us,\" even assuming further balance-sheet growth and capital return. </p><p>\n  This isn't to say expiration might not cause some issues down the road. JPMorgan Chase has warned that without an extension of SLR relief, it could be an issue for the bank if the Fed keeps expanding its balance sheet as anticipated. Other ways the bank could relieve the pressure include issuing preferred shares or turning away deposits. </p><p>\n  But even if banks weren't balance-sheet constrained, they have to weigh a number of factors when considering putting their growing liquidity into long-term Treasurys. If rates continue to rise, Treasurys fall in value, which can deduct from banks' capital levels. Banks can opt to hold Treasurys to maturity and avoid a capital hit. But ultimately in an improving economy, banks are looking to lend to consumers and businesses, not park money in government debt forever. </p><p>\n  One indicator of banks' mind-set: JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said this month in a Bloomberg interview that there is a good chance of interest rates going up, and that \"I've been very clear, I would not buy 10-year Treasurys.\" Large U.S. banks did sell about $33 billion of Treasurys in the four weeks ended Feb. 24, according to weekly Federal Reserve figures. But they offset that with purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities. </p><p>\n  Banks also have to consider the nature of their new deposits. Many incoming dollars could leave as the economy picks up, which means a bank would in any event want to have highly liquid assets such as cash at the Federal Reserve or very short-term instruments. \"These may be flighty deposits,\" says Wolfe analyst Steven Chubak. \"Banks have to think about what happens in the future.\" </p><p>\n  It is also not clear that banks' roles as market intermediaries would be immediately affected, according to rates strategist Mark Cabana at Bank of America. Dealer desks typically fund themselves via repurchase agreements, or \"repos,\" which weren't exempted from leverage ratios, noted rates strategists at Bank of America. The strategists wrote on Friday that extending the current SLR exemption may be \"only marginally beneficial\" for rates, though it may help current market conditions. </p><p>\n  A wider review of how banks and Treasury markets are regulated in a world of a bigger Fed balance sheet is warranted. But for now, there are still many underlying forces pushing up rates: a quickening economy, inflation concerns and expectations of future Fed tapering. Regulatory tweaks will be only part of that much bigger story. </p><p></p>",
