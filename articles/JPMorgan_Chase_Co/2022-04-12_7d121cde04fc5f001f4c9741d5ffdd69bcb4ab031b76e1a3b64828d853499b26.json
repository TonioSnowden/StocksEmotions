  "text": "<p>What happened</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 87.72 points, or 0.3%, to close at 34,220.36, after rising as much as 362 points, or 1.05%, in earlier activity.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 15.08 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 4,397.45, giving up an earlier gain of as much as 1.3%.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP ended at 13,371.57, down 40.38 points, or 0.3%, after rising 2.04% at its session high.</p><p>The Dow's turn south marked its biggest blown lead since March 11, while the turns lower for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were the biggest such moves since March 8, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow fell 413 points, or 1.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2%. The S&amp;P 500 ended the session down 7% on the year.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>U.S. consumer prices rose 1.2% in March, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. Year over year, prices rose 8.5% — the fastest pace since January 1982.</p><p>But the news that initially cheered investors was that core price growth slowed to a 0.3% monthly rise versus expectations for a 0.5% increase. That still nudged the year-over-year rate to a 40-year high of 6.5%.</p><p>Analysts said the core reading was somewhat encouraging but cautioned against reading too much into it.</p><p>“The best you can say is that core CPI came in lower than expected at ‘only' 6.5%,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “That might give some relief to markets which were preparing for the worst.”</p><p>See: Torrid inflation, now at 8.5%, ignites further debate in markets over where U.S. goes from here</p><p>The key, he said, is whether inflation has peaked and, if so, how fast it will decline. “While this reading probably locks in a more aggressive Fed action near-term, there is some reason to believe that CPI will decline enough by year-end to avoid the most severe Fed action.”</p><p>Read: Inflation in March ran hotter than expected. Here's the good news.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which on Monday reached a three-year high, dropped 5.5 basis points to 2.724%. The surge in yields has been making stocks less attractive on a relative basis and has weighed in particular on technology and other so-called growth shares whose valuations are based on earnings and cash flow far into the future.</p><p>A rebound by oil futures also accelerated in the afternoon, with the U.S. benchmark CL.1 jumping 6.7% to close at $100.60 a barrel.</p><p>Investors were also awaiting the unofficial kickoff of corporate earnings reporting season on Wednesday, with results due from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, while other big Wall Street banks were due to report on Thursday.</p><p>Earnings Outlook:U.S. banks are facing body blows from Ukraine war and a slump in investment banking activity</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>Shares of CarMax Inc.KMX fell 9.5% after the used-car retailer missed fiscal fourth-quarter profit estimates, offsetting a revenue beat.</p><p>How other assets traded</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.4%.</p><p>Gold futures GC00 rose 1.4%, to settle at $1,976.10 an ounce, extending its winning streak to four sessions.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP fell 0.4%, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX declined 0.5%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP rose 1.5%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 0.5% in Hong Kong and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK slumped 1.8%.</p>",
