  "title": "Wall Street CEOs Uncertain Fed Can Achieve Soft Landing; Citigroup's Jane Fraser, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and others face questions from Congress",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Dimon said competing forces are affecting the economy. They include strong consumer spending and plentiful job openings amid high inflation, disrupted supply chains, the war in Ukraine and declining consumer confidence. But he said it is difficult to accurately predict whether the Federal Reserve will succeed in achieving a soft landing, in which inflation moderates with only a mild decline in economic activity.</p><p>\"Because of the war in Ukraine and the uncertainty that causes in global energy supply and food supply, there's a chance it could be worse,\" he said.</p><p>The Fed is expected to approve its third consecutive interest-rate increase of 0.75 percentage point at a meeting that concludes Wednesday.</p><p>Ms. Fraser said higher rates are likely to moderate growth in the U.S. and other countries. \"We are very concerned about the high prices that consumers are facing in America and indeed around the world,\" she said.</p><p>The bank CEO hearings mark the third time since 2019 that top executives have appeared together before U.S. lawmakers. The executives appeared Wednesday at a hearing hosted by Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services panel. They are set to appear Thursday in the Senate.</p><p>In early questioning, Ms. Waters pressed Mr. Scharf of Wells Fargo on a series of regulatory and other actions, including a $250 million fine last year for a lack of progress in addressing long standing issues in its mortgage business. Mr. Scharf said the issues would take years to fix.</p><p>\"I firmly believe that we are making progress,\" he said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think will be the outcome of the hearing with the big bank CEOs? Join the conversation below.</p><p>North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel, pressed the banks on the costs of regulations, remarks that come as the Fed begins a broad review of capital and other requirements.</p><p>In a future downturn, Mr. Dimon said, JPMorgan could be sitting on $1 trillion but \"unable to deploy it.\" He praised the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul but said various post-crisis regulations had gone \"a little bit too far\" and needed to be recalibrated.</p><p>The executives are also expected to face questions on a range of policy issues as the hearings proceed, from racial equity and climate change to overdraft fees, mergers with other banks and the health of the economy, among other topics.</p><p>Some of the issues Democrats are expected to raise include diversity issues, executive compensation and scams on money-transfer services such as Zelle and Venmo.</p><p>Republican lawmakers, typically allies for financial firms, have lately criticized banks for taking what they view as liberal-leaning stances on policy issues. The GOP lawmakers are expected to ask about banks' policies related to abortion and a recent plan by credit-card companies to add a new code to identify when purchases are made at firearms retailers.</p><p>Mr. McHenry characterized Wednesday's hearing as \"theater, not oversight\" and criticized Democrats for what he described as posturing shortly before November's midterm elections.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Wall Street CEOs Uncertain Fed Can Achieve Soft Landing</p>",
