  "text": "<p>The Federal Reserve has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b5992d3-967e-4a63-b159-a398654d6199\">moved one step closer</a> to the day when it will start slowing its massive monetary support for the US economy, following a meeting of policymakers that highlighted both the promise and the perils of the American recovery.</p> <p>At the end of a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee declared that it had made “progress” towards its goals of full employment and 2 per cent<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37d57052-c2a5-4a44-8b27-9d205a2a1c50\"> average inflation</a>, even though it was not yet sufficient to merit any policy action right now.</p> <p>The statement marked the first milestone in the US central bank's steady drive towards a decision on reducing its $120bn a month debt purchases, a move that could come later this year or early next year.</p> <p>However, the central bank said any such<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42d3984b-6bae-49f0-b3c4-d16c2acff7cb\"> “tapering” </a>would require additional improvements in the economy and Jay Powell, Fed chair, said there was more “ground to cover” before it acts.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“We expect further progress, and we expect that if things go well then we will reach that goal. And when we reach it, and the committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then we'll taper at that point,” Powell said.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Four more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

As Gillian Tett notes, the subject of discussion wasn't war or foreign policy. They were there to take the collective decision to sever the dollar's link with the gold standard.</p> <p><strong>Lebanon's year from hell</strong> A blast in Lebanon's port on August 4 2020 killed more than 200 people, injured thousands and caused some $4bn worth of damage. It should have been a nadir for Lebanon. Instead, it was the beginning of a further fall, a year-long plunge into economic chaos, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfb4c56d-3718-4804-98e7-c22eeaa7da96\">writes Chloe Cornish</a>, who lives a mile from where the blast took place.</p> <p><strong>Music labels split over Spotify royalty plan </strong>Towards the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eaf53314-d72b-4dba-9110-87a27dce01a2\">Spotify began asking record companies</a> to participate in “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28b08913-b746-4a47-b817-2f2aeef32b89\">Discovery Mode</a>”, through which Spotify prioritises an artist's songs on select music feeds in exchange for reduced royalties.

They are the people on the periphery of your life.
