  "text": "<p>Santander is overhauling the management of two of its most important European businesses, including starting the search for a chief executive in the UK, as it looks to boost profitability after reporting its strongest quarterly earnings in more than a decade.</p> <p>Nathan Bostock, who has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d33aea-1a9b-11ea-9186-7348c2f183af\">led Santander UK</a> since 2014, will step down around the end of the year to take on a newly created role overseeing the group's various investment platforms.</p> <p>Much of Bostock's tenure was marked by falling profits and challenges at the UK business, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9c5df8d-1e11-4e76-8114-15e01473ffab\">was built</a> through a series of acquisitions of former building societies in the 2000s. A writedown of the business's goodwill value drove the 164-year-old bank to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e2d24f2-5a4c-40e8-a7f7-6fc8f1bebe58\">first-ever quarterly loss</a> last year.</p> <p>However, Bostock's successor will take over at a time of rising optimism, as the bank's earlier cost-cutting initiatives have begun to bear fruit and an improving economic outlook has boosted its growth prospects.</p> <p>“The bank is now extremely well positioned to succeed in the future with a clear strategy and an excellent platform for his successor and executive team colleagues to build on,” said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a6c1d8-f6d2-4018-b758-5809631c2ded\">William Vereker</a>, Santander UK chair. </p> <p>Santander UK was one of the multinational bank's fastest-growing markets in the first three months of the year, along with the US and its corporate and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c34fcc6-3a1d-4eac-a9c8-5a3d406899bc\">investment banking</a> division.</p> <p>Jose Garcia Cantera, Santander chief financial officer, said the results were “a vindication of our strategy” of international diversification.</p> <p>Like the UK, Santander's US business has been a frequent target of criticism in recent years, and the bank has ignored pressure from some investors and analysts to sell the unit.</p> <p>“This [performance] is not just because of the rebound in the economy — it is the result of all the work we've done in the last few years,” Cantera said. </p> <p>Net profits across the group leapt to €1.6bn in the first quarter from €331m in the same period last year. Using the bank's preferred underlying profit measure, which excludes certain restructuring costs, the results marked Santander's most profitable three-month period since the second quarter of 2010.</p> <p>The improvement reflected a sharp fall in provisions for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94faa98d-7b77-4d8c-8216-b73ce9ad1d81\">potential loan defaults</a>. New impairments dropped 49 per cent year on year to €2bn. However, the group did not follow the example of US banks such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0595526e-48fa-48ff-a594-d219f15b54a4\">JPMorgan</a> and European rival <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/ddd53802-2352-48ec-a15d-b2fc3b9da058?\">HSBC</a> in releasing some of the provisions it had put aside last year.</p> <p>Cantera said Santander had chosen to be cautious due to risks such as the threat of new coronavirus strains or problems with vaccine rollouts, but said the bank may be able to make similar writebacks later in the year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9592dc9a-6d43-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\">Ana Botín</a>, Santander executive chair, said the bank was confident of meeting its previously announced aims of increasing profitability and reducing credit losses, though she added that “the success of the vaccine rollout remains critically important to economic recovery”.&#xa0;</p> <p>António Simões, the former HSBC banker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de818260-7280-4cc1-9638-eefefce0c41e\">who joined</a> as regional head of Europe last year, will take direct responsibility for the company's home market as chief executive of Santander Spain, in addition to his existing role.</p> <p>Simões has been working to integrate the bank's European businesses, which include retail banks in Spain, Portugal, the UK and Poland.&#xa0;</p> <p>Incumbent Santander Spain boss Rami Aboukhair will become global head of cards and digital solutions.</p> <p>In the UK Susan Allen, who reported to Bostock as chief of retail and business banking, will leave the bank during the summer. Her responsibilities will be split between a head of everyday banking and head of homes.</p> <p>People close to the group said Tony Prestedge, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/829deed8-82d0-4a94-8522-fb7b7883f772\">joined</a> as Santander UK deputy chief executive last year, was seen as one potential replacement for Bostock. One person stressed that the bank would be carrying out a full search process that will include external candidates.</p><p>Source: Nicholas Megaw in London 2021 'Santander kicks off hunt for UK unit chief as earnings surge' FT.com 28 April.
