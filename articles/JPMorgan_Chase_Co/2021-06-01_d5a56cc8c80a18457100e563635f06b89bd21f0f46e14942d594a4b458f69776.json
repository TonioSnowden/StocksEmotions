  "text": "<p>Big financial businesses market themselves on their size and influence — until their size and influence attract unwelcome attention. Last decade, some US insurers fought designation as “systemically important”, which would have brought tighter regulation. The London-based Association for Financial Markets in Europe now follows a similar tack. It contends that City investment banks do not trade enough securities with clients to be regulated like stock exchanges.</p> <p>You can understand the nervousness at AFME, whose members include Barclays, BNP Paribas and JPMorgan. The Mifid II shake-up of regulation implemented in 2018 triggered a shakeout in trading and research. Market regulators may now revise the European financial markets rule book again. Banks are already wrestling with so-called Basel IV capital reforms.</p> <p>AFME's beef concerns regulatory interest in systematic internalisers (SIs). These are typically investment banks that deal on their own accounts to execute client orders off-exchange.</p> <p>The European Securities and Markets Authority <a href=\"https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:8a21caa0-ae83-4724-8260-b09d24004372\">reckons</a> one-fifth of equity trades — and just over a quarter of bond deals are — are transacted by SIs. In all, almost half of all trading by volume takes place off exchanges, according to the watchdog.</p> <p>These numbers would normally be a cause for rejoicing at investment banks. But growing clout could mean more compliance — and even exclusion of some institutions from the SI trade. Following the introduction of Mifid II, the number of UK trading venues and SIs crashed by six-sevenths to just 21.</p> <p>AFME, therefore, commissioned Oxera to pick Esma's figures apart. The financial and economic consultancy aimed to filter out trades that did not apparently contribute to price formation. Oxera concluded that 83 per cent of trades take place on trading venues, including exchanges and dark pools, and just 11 per cent on SIs.</p> <p>That nudges the debate back in AFME's direction. Nonetheless, it seems disingenuous to argue SIs are a special case. Their 10 per cent or so share of overall trading has held pretty steady in recent years. The trades must contribute at least partially to price discovery. </p> <p>There is certainly an argument to exclude some more technical transactions. These include “give-ups”, where a broker carries out a trade on behalf of another, and which both report. Likewise inter-affiliate trades.</p> <p>But that is no reason to exempt the banks from the entire regime — regardless of whose set of numbers you use.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline. </em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Mifid II/share trading: numbers game may not pay off for investment banks' FT.com 1 June.
