  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start</strong>: <strong>Andre De Cort</strong>, an associate of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86285e33-da81-4846-bee1-f7eefa44741a\">sanctioned oligarch</a> <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> who previously worked as his lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f7f3450-0473-45f3-9475-07e81102922f\">has resigned</a> as a director of <strong>Truphone</strong>. The British telecoms group is one of Abramovich's largest investments in the UK.</p> <h2>Dealmakers pause to party in the Big Easy</h2> <p>Investment bankers, corporate lawyers and their PR handlers have filled the streets of New Orleans to gossip and rustle up new business over drinks after two years of inking a record number of buyouts and mergers over <strong>Zoom</strong>. </p> <p>The annual <strong>Tulane Corporate Law Institute Conference</strong> has returned in person with a bang after a lengthy pandemic-driven hiatus, welcoming more than 400 dealmakers to talk shop while enjoying the hospitality and cuisine of New Orleans. </p> <p>After a night of partying at mainstays such as Arnaud's, where creole staples like fried oysters and muffuletta were paired with copious drinks, attendees sobered up on Thursday morning. </p> <p>Banker <strong>Gordon Dyal </strong>offered M&amp;A predictions, highlighting the buoyant mood among bankers for another stellar year, while also pointing out the adversarial regulatory environment, stemming from <strong>Lina Khan</strong>'s new position at the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>.</p> <p>As they contemplated a potential dealmaking hangover, bankers and lawyers filled into Galatoire's, the century-old Bourbon Street eatery, taking tables for lunch of gumbo, steak and crab to nurse more immediate headaches. </p> <p>They sat among throngs of boisterous bachelorettes wearing pink hats and tipsy St Patrick's day revellers clad in green. Conversations were occasionally interrupted as those in the restaurant broke out in song. </p> <p>Inside the historic Roosevelt Hotel, once frequented by “the Kingfish” governor <strong>Huey Long</strong>, attendees at the conference got texts from their colleagues back home dealing with Fomo and wondering if they'd missed out on a good party.</p> <p>Talk ranged from the record past year for dealmaking to the reawakening of activist investors after a sleepy pandemic and the slowdown in Spac activity. </p> <p>Despite an upbeat mood, a harsher regulatory environment was top of mind, with M&amp;A lawyers saying that Washington's heightened scrutiny has cut into the dealmaking appetite of the largest companies, which sit on trillions of dollars worth of cash.</p> <p>Though the outbreak of war in Europe hasn't yet slowed deal activity in the US, attention has turned to companies with ties to Russia and the potential damage from lucrative clients now being sanctioned by the west.</p> <p>The war made a bolder appearance outside the conference than on the inside.</p> <p>A billboard calling out <strong>Bruce Buck</strong>, a former partner at white-shoe law firm <strong>Skadden </strong>and chair of <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong>, for work with <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong>, was plastered on a truck outside the Roosevelt Hotel, as attendees snapped pictures of the scene and texted it to colleagues, thankful it wasn't their own book of business. </p> <p>Another sharp barb came from civil rights advocates <strong>Reverend Al Sharpton</strong> and <strong>Martin Luther King III</strong>, who critiqued the virtually all-white Delaware Chancery court, the venue where deals are ratified or disputed. In the predominantly black city of New Orleans, guests at the Tulane conference were overwhelmingly white.</p> <p>It's a feature of the M&amp;A world due for change as old festivities resume. </p> <h2>Ambani vs Bezos: the two-and-a-half-year saga takes a dramatic turn</h2> <p>Even after seizing the title of Asia's richest man and the 10th-richest person in the world, <strong>Reliance Industries</strong> chair <strong>Mukesh Ambani</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=OziMsGoK\">estimated</a> $89.5bn net worth remains just over half the size of <strong>Jeff</strong> <strong>Bezos</strong>'s colossal $178bn fortune.</p> <p>Perhaps that's why the <strong>Amazon</strong> founder believed not even Ambani could stand in the way of the Silicon Valley titan's quest for dominance over India's booming retail market.</p> <p>He underestimated just how far Ambani would go to defend his home turf.</p> <p>The billionaires' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/540c9c85-20f9-4643-8988-e2f882cd33bb\">two-and-a-half-year battle</a> for control of <strong>Future</strong>, one of India's largest brick-and-mortar retail chains, took a surprising turn this week when Ambani overtook Bezos with one of the boldest M&amp;A power moves DD has seen in quite some time.</p> <p>A quick refresher: Ambani made a move to acquire the pandemic-ravaged Future in 2020. But the deal hit a speed bump when <strong>Amazon</strong>, which owns an indirect minority stake in the retail group, alleged that Future's sale of its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to Reliance breached their pre-existing contract.</p> <p>After the saga played out in a Singapore arbitration tribunal and New Delhi courtrooms, Bezos appeared to be thrown a bone when India's Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/860d6873-166c-4fa5-aeea-ccfd07e8f541\">ruled last year</a> that Reliance couldn't take over Future until it hears the case.</p> <p>But then Ambani took matters into his own hands. The industrial magnate's Reliance had been leasing store space to cash-strapped Future while Amazon continued to stall its takeover of the retail and fashion conglomerate's assets. </p> <p>When Future stopped being able to pay rent, the Reliance boss terminated the leases and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd628dfe-1e20-45cf-ba6e-950a11ae9e4c\">took over</a> more than 800 of its stores — even offering fresh contracts to staff and rebranding shopfronts under its own marques, two people familiar with the store takeovers told the FT.</p> <p>Future has argued the deal with Ambani should be cleared, but then said on Wednesday that Reliance had “forcefully taken over control of hundreds” of stores, insisting it was “a surprise”. Meanwhile, Amazon has taken out ads in local newspapers accusing Reliance of “playing a fraud on” Indian courts and authorities. </p> <p>The tech group's chances of success are looking grim. “If stores are transferred to Reliance, there will be nothing for Amazon to fight for in courts,” Amazon lawyer <strong>Aspi Chinoy</strong> said during a court hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>Whether Ambani's aggressive tactics will sway regulators remains to be seen. What's clear is that in India, the home court advantage still reigns supreme.</p> <h2>Japan Inc stages a Covid comeback</h2> <p>While the past few years have heralded a dealmaking boom that started a pay revolution on Wall Street, a talent war in Big Law and boosted the bottom lines of banks on both sides of the Atlantic, one key financial hub has missed out: Japan.</p> <p>Now, the country's corporate chieftains are calling on the government to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2bf7e8b-cd35-4fa6-9caa-f49b8a2ebf1d\"> reclassify Covid-19 as endemic</a> and lift pandemic restrictions — some of the strictest in the world — to help unleash a two-year bottleneck of demand for overseas M&amp;A.</p> <p>Corporate Japan was betting heavily on cross-border M&amp;A in the years leading up to the pandemic. Pharma group <strong>Takeda</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4147d772-4887-11e8-8ae9-4b5ddcca99b3\">$65bn takeover </a>of rival <strong>Shire</strong>, <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s $32bn deal to buy<strong> Arm</strong>, and <strong>Renesas Electronics</strong> $6.7bn acquisition of <strong>Integrated Device Technology</strong> for $6.7bn had ushered in a golden age of overseas dealmaking.</p> <p>But while global M&amp;A cranked to record highs in the early stages of the pandemic, Japan fell behind.</p> <p>Just $65bn was spent by Japan on overseas targets in 2020, the lowest value of outbound M&amp;A deals in about six years, according to an FT analysis of <strong>Dealogic</strong> data. In 2021, the number of outbound deals fell to 406, its lowest level since 2006.</p> <p>Some Japanese companies have also struggled to adapt to the fast-digitising dealmaking landscape.</p> <p>“Without knowing the target, without doing the diligence, without having a face-to-face meeting, Japanese companies tend to hesitate to pay a big amount for a company which they don't know well,” said <strong>Koichiro Doi</strong>, head of Japan M&amp;A for <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>.</p> <p>Dealmakers are now hoping they can revive the glory days as senior M&amp;A bankers and lawyers anticipate an uptick in deal proposals in early May following the “golden week” holiday.</p> <p>While Japan's borders are still closed to tourists, the country's executives hope to play host to foreign business travellers in the coming months.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Alternative meat company <strong>Impossible Foods</strong> has named <strong>Peter McGuinness</strong>, the former chief operating officer of Greek-yoghurt maker <strong>Chobani</strong>, as its new chief executive. He replaces the group's founder <strong>Pat Brown</strong>, who will take on the role of chief visionary officer.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Bain </strong>consulting alum <strong>Jeff Zients</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ba298e8-117a-4558-93fb-03898989d475\">is stepping down</a> as chief Covid-19 adviser to US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong>. He will be replaced by public health expert <strong>Ashish Jha</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>South Korean ecommerce group<strong> Coupang</strong> has appointed <strong>Pedro Franceschi</strong>, co-founder and co-chief executive of corporate card fintech start-up <strong>Brex</strong>, to its board of directors.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Kleptocracy in Kensington </strong>On the surface, Roman Abramovich and his fellow oligarchs were powerful businessmen with a taste for London luxury.
