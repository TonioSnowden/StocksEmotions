  "text": "<p>When does a start-up have a $3tn balance sheet? When it's JPMorgan Chase.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2031a6f-827e-4e18-b81b-e607eb073988\">arrival of this nimble, digital neobank-cum-colossus</a> of the global banking world to the UK market ups the ante for retail banks already grappling with low interest rates, higher savings rates and less borrowing.</p> <p>The traditional high-street banks look squeezed between fast-growing, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d7b739c-ffbb-4a29-ac5b-4e7dfddff5ae\">highly valued fintech </a>upstarts on one side and by well-funded global competition on the other. But the pinch from this digital vice may not be felt where it's most obvious.</p> <p>Inertia is the retail banks' best friend. Despite efforts to shake up the market for current accounts — the loss-making gateway drug for retail banking services — switching remains at incredibly low levels. “The majority of neobank customers are still secondary accounts with the primary still held by the incumbent, and traditional banks have matched many of the account features that used to differentiate challenger players,” said Michael Harding at Oliver Wyman.&#xa0;</p> <p>Copying new gadgets or features cheaply and easily has helped hold on to accounts that could have been wooed away. Fintech rivals may be pushing into more lucrative areas such as small business banking: Revolut added 24 new retail or business products in 2020, according to Citi. But the path from a hyperactive launch schedule to profitability remains unclear for many.</p> <p>Chase is a different, more patient beast. The fact the US bank hasn't (publicly) put a customer target on its UK venture, and its intention to use this as a model for other international markets, suggests it is as focused on translating account openings into profitable users of multiple products as it is on winning low-traction secondary accounts. That certainly should be its marker for success.&#xa0;</p> <p>Regardless, the problem for incumbents is also part of the appeal for a from-scratch launch by Chase: The target customers of a digital-only start-up and a full-service established bank look increasingly similar.</p> <p>The UK made five years of progress in terms of digital engagement in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.lloydsbank.com/assets/media/pdfs/banking_with_us/whats-happening/210513-lloyds-consumer-digital-index-2021-report.pdf\">according to Lloyds Bank</a>. Cash machine withdrawals fell 39 per cent, according to UK Finance, while cash usage in transactions, at 17 per cent, has fallen much further and faster than was forecast even two years ago. Use of online banking services grew fastest among the over-45s during the pandemic — and, according to McKinsey, there is now no marked difference in <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/reshaping-retail-banking-for-the-next-normal#\">the willingness to use digital banking services</a> between age groups.</p> <p>For banks built for an in-person world, that means a familiar headache: costs. Operating costs per customer for the biggest UK banks have stayed stubbornly high over the past decade at about £200, according to Oliver Wyman; neobanks at scale are working at a tenth of that (albeit with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af9d0f96-c83d-4dbb-817c-d40bf16d7ea7\">lower revenues per customer</a>).</p> <p>Part of the issue will be real estate, and accelerating branch closures are increasingly drawing political and regulatory attention <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b04d72a-0dd8-4547-9f3c-bea875298db9\">with a looming battle</a> over “last in town” provision. That may reignite a debate over state support for cash distribution, as suggested in the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/report/2019/future-of-finance-report.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=59CEFAEF01C71AA551E7182262E933A699E952FC\">Future of Finance report</a> produced for the Bank of England in 2019.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it will also mean <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae57bfcc-1e50-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d\">looking at legacy computer systems</a> and the people needed to operate them. Incumbent digital start-ups, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d75ec66-9963-4497-8c08-f37591e955f3\">such as NatWest's B</a>ó, weren't always closed because they couldn't work, argued one banking expert, but because that money would be better spent improving systems for millions of customers rather than chasing a distinct demographic whose online behaviour is converging with the market norm.</p> <p>Vast numbers of customers and huge amounts of data aren't much use if it's split between legacy divisions and operated manually using ancient tech. And survey evidence suggests that investors, who are broadly <a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2020/January/Oliver-Wyman-State-of-the-Financial-Services-Industry-2020.pdf\">sceptical about investment in this area</a>, see much greater scope to remove costs through digital spending than boost revenues with the latest whizzy offering.&#xa0;</p> <p>The digital challenge is as much internal as external.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:helen.thomas@ft.com\">helen.thomas@ft.com</a><br><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/helentbiz\">@helentbiz</a></p><p>Source: Helen Thomas 2021 'JPMorgan will tighten the digital squeeze on UK banks' FT.com 22 September.
