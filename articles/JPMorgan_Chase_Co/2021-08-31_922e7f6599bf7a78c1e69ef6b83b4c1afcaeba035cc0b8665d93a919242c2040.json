  "title": "Texas GOP Lawmakers Send Voting Bill to Governor's Desk; Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he plans to sign into law new election restrictions, overcoming Democratic opposition",
  "text": "<p>Gov. Abbott supports the measure and said Tuesday that he looks forward to signing it into law.</p><p>The battle over the bill is part of a national debate over voting rules following President Biden's election, which former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters claim was illegitimate, though no court has found evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p><p>In recent months, states including Florida and Georgia passed GOP-led measures placing more restrictions on certain types of voting, drawing pushback from civil-rights groups, companies and Democrats across the U.S.</p><p>Provisions in the Texas bill include limiting early voting hours to between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., rather than allowing counties to offer as many voting hours as they choose above a certain minimum. The bill also places new restrictions on structures that can be used for voting. It bans public officials from offering people unsolicited applications to vote by mail.</p><p>The GOP bill also increases penalties for election-related paperwork that is submitted incorrectly and makes many violations of the code felony offenses.</p><p>Democrats in Texas made many attempts to halt the bill, including through a walkout in May ahead of a voting deadline as the state legislature's regular biennial session wound down. The move denied the legislative body the two-thirds quorum required to conduct a vote. Two months later, more than 55 House Democrats went to Washington, D.C., to once again deny a quorum during a special session Mr. Abbott called.</p><p>The Texas Democrats lobbied Congress for federal legislation that would curb some of the recent state-level voting changes. But a Democratic-led federal voting bill faces long odds amid broad Republican opposition in the closely divided Senate, where the filibuster creates a 60-vote threshold for most measures to passâ€”a rule that some Democratic senators who support new voting legislation have resisted calls to change.</p><p>Texas Republicans managed to advance their state-level bill because they control both chambers of the legislature and the governor's office. Mr. Abbott had vowed to keep calling special sessions to pass the bill; the most recent one started on Aug. 7, and the 38-day standoff ended on Aug. 20.</p><p>The bill, known as Senate Bill 1, \"will solidify trust and confidence in the outcome of our elections by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat,\" Mr. Abbott said in a statement after the bill cleared the Texas Senate Tuesday.</p><p>Opponents said the 75-page bill would create additional hurdles to voting in what civil-rights groups already rank as one of the country's most difficult states in which to cast ballots. Democrats and voting groups say Republicans across the U.S. have used unsupported claims of voter fraud to create a pretext for limiting access to the polls.</p><p>\"With S.B. 1, the GOP has only one goal: to keep Republicans in power by limiting Texans' voting access,\" Gilberto Hinojosa, chair of the Texas Democratic Party, said in a statement.</p><p>Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com</p><p>Texas GOP Lawmakers Send Voting Bill to Governor's Desk</p>",
