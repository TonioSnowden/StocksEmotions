  "text": "<p>Tyson Foods Inc. Chief Financial Officer John R. Tyson, great-grandson of the meat giant's founder, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges of criminal trespass and public intoxication.</p><p>Mr. Tyson will have a trial on the charges Feb. 15, according to Fayetteville District Court. A Tyson spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Last month Mr. Tyson was arrested after local police said he was found asleep in the wrong Fayetteville, Ark. house. The 32-year-old executive has twice apologized for the incident, saying it doesn't reflect his or the company's values, and that he would seek counseling for his alcohol use. The company has said its board is reviewing the incident.</p><p>\"I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions,\" Mr. Tyson said on a Nov. 14 earnings call with analysts a week after spending an early Sunday morning in jail on Nov. 6. \"I am committed to making sure that this never happens again.\"</p><p>Mr. Tyson was appointed in late September as CFO of Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales. Before taking over as CFO, he had been serving as Tyson's executive vice president of strategy and chief sustainability officerâ€”roles he still holds. He joined Tyson in 2019, after earning a master's of business administration degree from Stanford University. He has held various roles in investment banking, private equity and venture capital, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p><p>Mr. Tyson's father, John H. Tyson, has been chairman since 1998 and served as the company's chief executive from 2000 until 2006.</p><p>(More to Come)</p><p>Write to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com</p><p>Tyson CFO Pleads Not Guilty to Public Intoxication, Trespassing Charges</p>",
