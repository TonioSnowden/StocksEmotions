  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Hertz Seeks to List Stock on Nasdaq  ----  By Omar Abdel-Baqui and Alexander Saeedy",
  "text": "<p>   Hertz Global Holdings Inc. said some of its stockholders are selling 37.1 million common shares, as the rental-car company seeks to start trading again on a major stock exchange. </p><p>   The shares will be sold between $25 and $29 each and proceeds would go to stockholders selling them, not Hertz, the company said Wednesday in a regulatory filing. </p><p>   The proposed sale of stock represents a large windfall to the investor group who helped fund Hertz's exit from chapter 11 in June, including Knighthead Capital Management LLC, Certares Opportunities LLC, and Apollo Global Management Inc. </p><p>   Hertz stock, which trades over the counter, fell 10% to $31.60 on Wednesday afternoon. The shares had more than doubled from August through Tuesday's close. </p><p>   The rental-car company's stock has traded over the counter since it was delisted last year after the company went bankrupt. </p><p>   Hertz said Wednesday it has applied to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol HTZ. </p><p>   A Hertz representative wasn't immediately available for comment. </p><p>   Hertz's stock price rose sharply after announcing last week a deal to buy 100,000 Teslas. </p><p>   Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk cast doubt on the deal when he said late Monday on Twitter that a contract has yet to be signed with Hertz. </p><p>   The car-rental company on Tuesday stood by its announcement and said Tesla deliveries have already begun, but a spokeswoman declined to say whether there was a contract between the two companies. </p><p>   In the Wednesday filing, Hertz said Knighthead and Certares will own 37.2% of the company after the offering assuming the underwriters' option is exercised in full. </p><p>   The two firms billed themselves as long-term investors in Hertz during the chapter 11 bankruptcy, when two competing groups of investors jockeyed to own the rental-car company in an auction process. </p><p>   Hertz said it intends to buy between $250 million and $500 million of the common shares from the underwriters. It also said it intends to make an offer to purchase the company's outstanding $1.5 billion preferred stock, provided by Apollo, by the end of this year. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities, and Morgan Stanley are acting as lead bookrunning managers for the proposed offering, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing. </p><p></p>",
