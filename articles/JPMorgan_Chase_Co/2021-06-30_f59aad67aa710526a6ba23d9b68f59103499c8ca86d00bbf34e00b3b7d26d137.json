  "text": "<h2>A PR firm in crisis looks within</h2> <p>DD has no intention of turning into the <a href=\"https://www.odwyerpr.com/\">O'Dwyer</a> report, a specialist publication on the veiled world of corporate communications.&#xa0;</p> <p>But we have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f555d441-82eb-4215-8f09-a5496d339870\">more breaking news</a> from an industry that typically avoids the spotlight.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Declan Kelly</strong>, chief executive, chair and co-founder of the New York PR powerhouse <strong>Teneo</strong>, has resigned just five days after DD's Arash Massoudi and the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77203615-503e-4f6d-8011-1dbf99286140\">revealed</a> he had inappropriately touched a number of women without their consent at a charity concert for the non-profit group <strong>Global Citizen</strong>.</p> <p>The departure of Kelly, a skilled CEO whisperer and crisis manager who has been instrumental in helping recruit top executives, has thrown the fate of the firm into question.</p> <p>The Irish-born executive is the second key figure to depart following the resignation of his co-founder <strong>Doug Band</strong>, a former aide to US president <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, in December. (Band left after <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/confessions-of-a-clintonworld-exile\">this astonishing interview</a> in Vanity Fair called “Confession of a Clintonworld exile” — a must read.)</p> <p>Among the blue-chip clients Kelly helped bring on board was <strong>General Motors</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37f8b75-f29f-4f6f-83d3-b9e559a2c79e\">cancelled</a> its recently inked $250,000 per-month contract with Teneo following the FT's reporting of the incident, stoking fears of a potential client exodus in the process. Kelly had been personally advising GM's chief executive <strong>Mary Barra</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Paul Keary</strong>, Teneo's third co-founder and chief operating officer, will take over from Kelly “effective immediately”, the firm said on Tuesday.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Kelly told the FT last week that the executive had become inebriated and behaved inappropriately towards both women and men at the Global Citizen event.</p> <p>In a statement, Kelly said that he had made “an inadvertent, public and embarrassing mistake for which I took full responsibility”, adding, “a campaign against the reputation of our firm has followed and may even continue in the coming days. However, regardless of the veracity of any such matters I do not want them to be an ongoing distraction to the running of our company.”</p> <p>With its most skilled moneymaker out of commission, the firm may need to lean further on its repertoire of well-connected senior advisers, which includes former <strong>Xerox</strong> boss <strong>Ursula Burns</strong>, ex-Speaker of the US House of Representatives <strong>Paul Ryan</strong>, and former UK foreign secretary <strong>William Hague</strong>.</p> <p>But the problem for Teneo is that it has ultimately relied on Kelly and Band for its growth, rise to prominence, and network. With both of them out, it raises the very legitimate question of what is left.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD was seeking answers to this question late on Tuesday, but no one had a great answer.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Private equity goes public&#xa0;</h2> <p>It's a good time to own shares in a listed private equity firm.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Blackstone</strong>,<strong> KKR</strong>,<strong> Carlyle</strong> and<strong> Apollo</strong> are trading at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d0e6f18-2d56-4175-98c5-e13559bdbc25\">highs</a>, as are European peers <strong>EQT</strong>, <strong>3i Group</strong> and<strong> Partners Group</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's in part due to investors such as pension funds, which are pouring ever-increasing sums into private markets in the hope of high returns, at a time when low interest rates make decent yields harder and harder to find.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, one of their peers is getting in on the action, as DD's Kaye Wiggins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d2e01b5-fdae-4a6a-ba30-286996df3ca5\">reports</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bridgepoint Advisers</strong>, a London-based middle-market buyout group that traces its roots to a management buyout from <strong>NatWest Equity Partners</strong> two decades ago, is preparing to list on the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>.</p> <p>Bridgepoint is owned by 140 of its staff and by <strong>Dyal Capital Partners</strong>, which holds a 20 per cent stake following a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d6f07d4-9d55-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4\">deal</a> struck in 2018. Under the proposals, existing shareholders would sell down a portion of their stakes and would see their holdings diluted as new shares worth about £300m are issued.&#xa0;</p> <p>A big attraction to incoming shareholders is that private equity firms can charge pension funds and other investors a management fee, as a percentage of the money they invest.</p> <p>The listing is well-timed, Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/019e0a99-ed6a-45b6-a47f-f2f3e826f058\">points out</a>. Just a year after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/957617c7-37a1-43c2-a44e-b0f6f2355316\">buying</a> EQT's €3.9bn credit arm, Bridgepoint has €27.4bn of assets under management. Management fees attach to about two-thirds of that.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shareholders are essentially buying into the reliable revenue streams that come from those fees, though it's worth remembering that they also stand to benefit from larger but less frequent payouts of carried interest — typically a 20 per cent share of the profits from private equity deals.</p> <p>That creates a situation in which institutional investors already shelling out management fees to private equity firms could now purchase shares in those very companies, thus granting themselves exposure to — that's right — the steady flow of fee income.&#xa0;</p> <p>While this may seem like the sort of thing investors would object to, it hasn't stopped rivals from completing successful IPOs. EQT, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8abf815a-de92-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59\">listed</a> in 2019, is now trading at almost four times its listing price. That's likely what got Bridgepoint interested in the first place.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Greensill: a little misunderstanding</h2> <p><strong>Lex Greensill </strong>was unequivocal: before its spectacular implosion, his eponymous finance firm did not lend money to either of its “two large institutional shareholders”.</p> <p>The 44-year-old financier gave this unambiguous statement last month, while being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9061d4a1-a2cd-435c-a220-a8c0e1266277\">grilled by British lawmakers</a> on the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\"><strong>Greensill Capital</strong>.</a> Regular DD readers will need no reminder on who those shareholders were:<strong> General Atlantic</strong> and<strong> SoftBank's Vision Fund</strong>.</p> <p>Lex Greensill is usually a man who chooses his words carefully. And on SoftBank, the statement seemed technically true. Greensill lent lots of money to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6995af3b-5f66-4e1b-9143-1e9daccfc9b4\">other companies</a> in the Vision Fund — such as the now also bankrupt construction outfit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a70b6130-b062-4850-8759-4a10a5a26f3d\"><strong>Katerra</strong></a> — but, as far as we know, not to SoftBank itself.</p> <p>However, when it came to General Atlantic — the “growth equity” pioneer with over $50bn in assets — DD was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b4d681f-72e3-4199-89ae-691d30e4f137\">puzzled</a>. After all, the FT had reported that Greensill gave its shareholder a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb7f2fe-7589-457e-8c5d-e5f515c557da\">€300m loan</a> in 2019, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6955091f-4339-4f1b-b4d7-92d2ef05d4c6\"><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> refinanced</a> this year after the once-hotly touted finance firm collapsed.</p> <p>Well, after a request for clarification on this point from the UK's <strong>Treasury select committee</strong>, Lex Greensill revised his version of events:</p> <p><em>“I would like to correct the record on this point and apologise for my misunderstanding of the original question. Greensill Capital provided a facility for a subsidiary of General Atlantic, which was repaid in full in 2021.”</em></p> <p>Misunderstandings happen, we suppose!</p> <p>DD was also excited on Tuesday to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e724711a-d4f2-4f6e-b997-1bc5c1421006\">finally hear</a> from one of the smaller players in the sprawling Greensill scandal.<strong> Milan Patel</strong> of<strong> King &amp; King</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/125d7319-70c5-4e50-b305-a2ed9ddc4474\">obscure accounting firm</a> that audits dozens of companies owned by Greensill's major client <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>, made a star turn in front of MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee.</p> <p>Asked what he knew about the now infamous “future receivables” financing that Greensill provided to clients such as Gupta, Patel said: “To be honest, until I read in the newspaper I had no idea what future receivables was.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tony Pullinger</strong>, the deputy director-general of the UK's <strong>Takeover Panel</strong>, is retiring at the end of the year after 30 years with the body. He will be replaced by<strong> James Arculus</strong>, who is current head of UK M&amp;A at <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group</strong> has hired <strong>Rukhein Davis</strong> as managing director and head of corporate derivative solutions. He joins from <strong>Bank of America</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins </strong>has hired <strong>Helen Lethaby</strong> as a partner in the tax department in the London office. She joins from <strong>Freshfields</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Salesforce Ventures</strong> senior vice-president and managing partner<strong> Matt Garratt </strong>is joining Palo Alto-based venture capital firm <strong>CRV</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>PwC UK </strong><a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/pwc-uk-announces-sixty-three-new-partners.html\">named</a> 63 partners.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Iced out </strong>HSBC has long walked a geopolitical tightrope between Beijing and its western roots.
