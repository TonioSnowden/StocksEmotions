  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>McDonald's, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Starbucks, Unilever: the list of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21e27317-5151-43c8-b0be-40f37542698d\">consumer brands</a> quitting Russia has gathered pace over the past few days, joining what one Yale professor has dubbed “the business blockade” of Russian president Vladimir Putin's regime.</p> <p>The departure of names such as McDonald's and Levis are loaded with historical meaning. The sight of crowds queueing for Big Macs in Moscow was seen as a marker of the end of the Soviet Union, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/087fcb3d-d5cb-45e7-84df-30a9020ca103\">Levi's</a> 501 jeans had become a symbol of dissent behind the Iron Curtain. </p> <p>There have been a few notable exceptions, such as Danone chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d8494cb-ed00-4bdd-9e9b-1fa295ef109e\">Antoine de Saint-Affrique</a>, who defended its decision to stay in Russia, arguing&#xa0;that it had a “responsibility to the people we feed, the farmers who provide us with milk, and the tens of thousands of people who depend on us”.</p> <p>It's not just consumer brands. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3d1d58a-b810-4200-aa52-27f3fedd0e5e\">Shell</a> said yesterday it would withdraw completely and halt new purchases of Russian oil. France's Total is under pressure to follow suit.</p> <p>Russian companies are starting to feel the heat, especially in financial services. The international ambitions of state-backed institutions VTB and Sberbank have been hobbled by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ceaee9-aac4-42b7-b698-c3bf2a616f36\">sanctions</a>, but at home — where the two lenders account for nearly half of the banking market — they are being hit even harder. JPMorgan Chase has joined MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/915e09c9-3694-459d-a271-c26074daa235\">removing Russian debt</a> from their bond indices.</p> <p>On the other side of the economic war, European companies — especially those in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82340b2a-f027-4b0e-8217-d016135f1e83\">energy-intensive</a> sectors such as metals — are bracing for some serious fallout.</p> <p>For carmakers, which are already facing high input costs and supply chain problems, the rise in energy bills — their highest costs&#xa0;after labour and raw materials — is another blow to their competitiveness. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bbb3a7d-00e2-4043-b85a-593eb116a9fe\">Airlines</a>, the most <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a4ef6b4-10dc-4da4-9200-8957acf35c63\">oil-intensive sector</a> of all, now have to contend with a second serious crisis in under two years as the price of fuel rockets and flight maps have to be redrawn. “We have dealt with the pestilence, only to be visited with a war,” said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.</p> <p>Fertiliser and chemical companies are also badly affected. Norway's Yara has warned of a food crisis. Russia is a key source of materials for the fertilisers that power global agriculture. Petrochemical companies are also likely to suffer from the soaring price of naphtha, which is made from crude oil and used to create resins and plastics. Almost half of Europe's naphtha imports come from Russia.</p> <p>European banks with a large exposure to Russia such as Italy's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fae7d5b7-112b-4b41-931c-e53643ab4d36\">UniCredit</a>, France's Société Générale and Austria's Raiffeisen Bank&#xa0;are also likely to be hit. UniCredit said an “extreme scenario” whereby its entire Russian business is wiped out, would leave it with losses of €7bn.</p> <p>But back to that company exodus. Despite the McFlurry of big names heading for the exit, many others have yet to take a position, reports our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fffb3b5d-d75e-4ca0-a8f8-d9aac8d4e140\">Moral Money newsletter</a>.</p> <p>In any case, argues senior trade writer Alan Beattie, many of those leaving are driven more by the threat of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fed1ebb5-e97d-424f-a313-2bb0d1cb8181\">damage from sanctions</a> than their virtue-signalling might suggest. He points out that many are happy to do business with other autocracies that do some pretty vile things. </p> <p>“Jumping from Russia before you are pushed is self-interest: it is not an act of principle,” he says.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>EU adds 14 more Russian business chiefs and 146 lawmakers to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b45ec05a-7f2b-491f-806e-4e5c0082cdb6\">sanctions list</a></p></li>  <li><p>UAE to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81630924-deb4-4ee8-abed-006a90972bb0#post-55ca2fe5-70e6-43ad-81bf-c91c08edad3c\">encourage fellow Opec members</a> to boost oil production</p></li>  <li><p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57504561-7d50-4939-8fbb-624354ef4ca4\">opens door to UK fracking</a> in response to Ukraine war</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81630924-deb4-4ee8-abed-006a90972bb0\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The US and UK decision to ban <strong>Russian oil imports</strong> has opened up a new front in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e0b1d84-e595-4c5a-be4e-928417b9c7cc\">economic war</a> against Vladimir Putin — here's our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f98e62e3-7008-4a3e-b835-55568b74ee30\">explainer</a> on what it means for global energy markets. Our Big Read examines whether <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93eb06ec-ba6c-4ad2-8fae-5b66235632b2\">coal could be the big winner</a> as Europe scrambles to find alternatives. Calls are also growing for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fee88e80-8ba9-4ab8-9d79-cbd9235dd29b\">more fracking</a>. Meanwhile, British consumers are being asked to cut their energy use by turning down the heating and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/364b27e3-0ba9-4b0a-9fa7-c48fb6350d36\">driving more slowly</a>.</p> <p>The threat to the economic recovery is the uncomfortable backdrop to tomorrow's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e2da65d-d611-409e-9981-3b50ef2699bd\">policy meeting</a> of the <strong>European Central Bank</strong>. However, European stocks were lifted by hopes that new<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a220a361-16e8-4271-a48b-9a34a091396f\"> EU stimulus</a> could be on the way. The seriousness of the situation was underlined by economics editor Chris Giles, who compares the Russian oil shock with those of the 1970s and examines its potential to result in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc513e50-eb68-43aa-b718-fcb4f8031c03\">stagflation</a> — the toxic combination of slow growth and high inflation. </p> <h1>UK and Europe latest</h1> <p>Ahead of his March 23 spring statement and as the economic fallout from Ukraine starts to worsen the cost of living crisis, UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> is under mounting pressure to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7daa9b4-a8f4-4b05-a4ef-8dec5612f538\">cut taxes</a>. <strong>Consumer spending</strong> strengthened in February as offices reopened and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52be1be1-6e5f-425a-8b56-32746db7397c\">social life resumed</a>, according to payments company Barclaycard, backed up by similar findings from the British Retail Consortium. However, the cost of living is moving up consumers' list of concerns.</p> <p>UK MPs fast-tracked a new <strong>economic crimes bill</strong>, but foreign secretary Liz Truss admitted that the country had been “slower” than the EU and US to impose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04a52ec8-7049-4148-b161-4ab5b6b91044\">sanctions on Russian oligarchs</a>. British taxpayers could be on the hook for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eea84abc-e0e6-48de-a5c2-2fb7f4cd2860\">£50mn in loan guarantees</a> to several of them.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>Decades of work by <strong>China</strong> to globalise its currency by increasing its use in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5346dcd-d23c-4f82-abc9-e29dc53a0fb5\">international finance</a> is bearing fruit as investors cast around for new haven assets amid the current turmoil. The renminbi, the currency of Russia's closest strategic ally and top trading partner, has remained conspicuously stable throughout the crisis. Still, the Lex column is sceptical that Beijing can provide <strong>financial infrastructure</strong> such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9c74da-923f-4c54-bf19-4e03786ab9af\">card payments</a> to help Moscow get around sanctions.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>The global <strong>nickel</strong> market, which was already surging because of the Ukraine conflict, came to a halt today after soaring prices prompted China's leading commodities exchange to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01ebd493-9df2-417c-9f5b-cbfd9fec229f\">freeze trading</a> in some of its most active contracts. Russia is the world's third-biggest nickel supplier with 13 per cent of global capacity.</p> <p><strong>Cathay Pacific</strong>'s chief executive said the airline expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b9db7b2-380e-47ac-b837-9b26c9328ae7\">burn up to HK$1.5bn</a> ($192mn) a month as a result of Hong Kong's strict pandemic restrictions, as it reported a net loss of HK$5.5bn for 2021. Meanwhile, local residents are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b250bf5-4475-4596-8729-86e1d342dd9e\">stuck in limbo</a> waiting for authorities to act as <strong>Covid cases soar</strong>, reports deputy Asia news editor Ravi Mattu from our bureau in the city.<br><br>Losses at UK furniture retailer <strong>Made.com</strong> more than doubled to £31.4mn as supply chain pressures and rising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaa8804a-6731-421d-aa29-2458c0f94f14\">shipping costs</a> started to bite. The furniture sector has been particularly badly hit by freight pressures as many of its big, bulky items, or their raw materials, are sourced from China and elsewhere in Asia.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>The experience of lockdown and working from home has spurred many people to switch jobs, but what are the pitfalls? Work and careers columnist Lucy Kellaway has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22e6b8ee-1376-49c9-8a16-f3c47cb6e209\">four big lessons</a> for getting the most out of a <strong>career change</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Working women</strong>, who already have the lion's share of domestic burdens, were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus crisis, commonly shouldering extra childcare and teaching responsibilities as schools were shuttered — all to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6f4176c-4aba-46c3-9ceb-1d88491b2d18\">detriment of their careers</a>. “As the world emerges from the pandemic, now is the time to ensure that the cost of care shows up somewhere other than in women's wealth,” the FT Editorial Board says.</p> <p>“The pandemic has hit the female talent leadership pipeline hard,” writes Eleanor Mills, founder of a platform for <strong>women in mid-life</strong>. Companies need to do more to support women through “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/162a607c-4072-4706-91fd-5a7fb252be91\">pinch-points</a>”, such as divorce, extra caring responsibilities and the experience of menopause, if they are going to reap the benefits of their hard-won wisdom, she argues.</p> <p><strong>Menopause</strong> is also the subject of the latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/779e0e69-ead6-4500-abb1-e0a8d0ac4a37\">Working It</a> podcast.
