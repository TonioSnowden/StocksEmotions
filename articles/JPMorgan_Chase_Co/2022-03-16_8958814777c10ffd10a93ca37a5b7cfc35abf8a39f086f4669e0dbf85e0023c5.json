  "title": "Once Home to Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sentencing Commission Now Sits Quiet as Issues Go Unresolved; The federal panel, which guides the judiciary on criminal sentencing, hasn't had a quorum in several years because of unfilled vacancies",
  "text": "<p>Established by Congress in 1984, the commission is a bipartisan, independent agency tasked with promoting consistency in federal sentencing, so that defendants in different parts of the country don't receive wildly different sentences for the same offenses. It establishes sentencing policies to advise federal judges and analyzes sentencing data nationwide.</p><p>The commission, which resides within the judicial branch, has written sentencing guidelines for every major crime in the criminal code, taking broadly worded federal laws and adding specificity for how judges should apply them to real-world circumstances. When the commission is fully operational, it regularly considers guideline updates to ensure that criminal sentences are appropriate and applied uniformly.</p><p>\"Every single person who is charged or could be charged in federal court has their fate shaped, if not completely determined, by the work of this commission,\" said Ohio State University law professor Douglas Berman.</p><p>Judge Jackson, a Washington, D.C., federal appeals court judge whose confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court begin next week, first worked at the commission from 2003 to 2005 as an assistant special counsel, where she analyzed sentencing policies and drafted legislative proposals for amending federal sentencing guidelines. She returned in 2010 after then-President Obama nominated her to be a commissioner, a post she held until 2014.</p><p>During her tenure, the commission voted to lower crack cocaine sentences and in 2014 adopted guideline changes for an array of drug offenses, leading to more than 30,000 people receiving an average reduction of two years, one of the largest prison reductions in recent times. Those changes also helped build momentum for bipartisan passage of the First Step Act, a 2018 law that overhauled sentencing rules and eased certain mandatory-minimum sentences.</p><p>Commissioners serve staggered terms, and the panel must include at least three federal judges and no more than four people from the same political party.</p><p>In early 2018 when there were still four commissioners, then-President Donald Trump submitted five nominees for consideration, but some of them came under criticism as too conservative and the Republican-controlled Senate never acted on the nominations. The commission lost its quorum at the beginning of 2019. In 2020, Mr. Trump said he intended to submit a new batch of nominees, but he never formally sent them to the Senate.</p><p>Now, President Biden is in position to appoint the whole commission anew, when there is bipartisan support for making some aspects of federal sentencing less harsh. The president, however, hasn't yet nominated a slate of commissioners and the White House declined to comment on when he may do so.</p><p>\"The potential for the commission to do big things with the right set of people is huge,\" said New York University law professor Rachel Barkow, a former commissioner.</p><p>The commission's acting chairman and lone member, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, said he hopes a new commission will conduct a comprehensive review of the federal guidelines.</p><p>\"Science and evidence has come forward suggesting that lengthy sentences do not necessarily result in community safety,\" said Judge Breyer, who will remain on the commission until the end of the year. He is the brother of retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.</p><p>The commission employs a full-time staff and can continue to collect sentencing data and publish reports. However, in the absence of a quorum, it hasn't been able to address murky areas of the law or guidelines that may be out of date.</p><p>In January, Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Amy Coney Barrett added their voices to the chorus of people who want the commission up and running. In an appeal the Supreme Court turned away about drug crimes and career offenders, the two justices noted that lower courts were split on how to apply the law and needed guidance.</p><p>\"It is the responsibility of the Sentencing Commission to address this division to ensure fair and uniform application of the Guidelines,\" Justice Sotomayor wrote in a statement joined by Justice Barrett. Unresolved sentencing issues \"can have direct and severe consequences for defendants' sentences,\" she wrote, adding, \"I hope in the near future the Commission will be able to resume its important function in our criminal justice system.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How can progress be made to ensure that federal sentencing guidelines are consistent? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Among current pressing issues are questions about who is eligible for a compassionate release from prison. The First Step Act gave courts more room to review requests for compassionate release. It also called for an updated policy statement from the commission relating to which \"extraordinary and compelling'' reasons warranted early release.</p><p>In 2018, federal courts around the country granted compassionate release to 24 people, according to a commission report. But since the First Step Act was passed, federal data shows that more than 4,100 people have secured compassionate release, most during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In many judicial circuits, judges are using compassionate release to address prison sentences they view as excessively long. But not all federal courts believe the act gives them broad leeway. The commission highlighted the discrepancies in a new report issued last week, noting that one circuit in the northeast is granting compassionate-release requests 48% of the time, while another circuit in the south is granting them at a 14% rate.</p><p>Write to Deanna Paul at deanna.paul@wsj.com</p><p>Once Home to Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sentencing Commission Now Sits Quiet as Issues Go Unresolved</p>",
