  "text": "<p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. said Friday that its second-quarter profit declined 48%.</p><p>The San Francisco-based bank said it made $3.12 billion in the quarter, down from $6.04 billion a year ago. Per-share earnings totaled 74 cents, below the 80 cents expected from analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The bank posted revenue of $17.03 billion, down 16% from $20.27 billion a year ago. That came in below expectations of $17.48 billion.</p><p>Investors are paying attention to big-bank earnings for signs about whether a recession is on the horizon. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley reported lower second-quarter profits Thursday, sending bank stocks down across the board. Bank stocks tend to rise and fall with expectations for the broader economy, since the companies are tied closely to the financial health of consumers.</p><p>Wells Fargo said it set aside $235 million in new funds to cover potential losses because of loan growth it experienced during the quarter.</p><p>Outstanding loans rose 11% from a year ago and 4% from the previous quarter. Wells Fargo's commercial segment powered the growth, recording a 15% increase from a year ago. Loans in the bank's consumer division rose 5%.</p><p>Wells Fargo's net interest income, a measure of lending profit, rose 16% to $10.2 billion.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has raised rates three times so far this year, including twice in the second quarter. Higher interest rates typically benefit banks, but investors are concerned the central bank's rapid rate increases could tip the economy into a recession.</p><p>Rising rates are also a challenge for banks' mortgage businesses. Higher rates have dried up demand for refinancings, a key source of revenue for mortgage lenders in 2020 and 2021. Higher borrowing costs are also weighing on demand from potential buyers. Wells Fargo, one of the country's largest mortgage lenders, said originations fell 36% in the second quarter.</p><p>Auto loan originations decreased 35%.</p><p>The bank's noninterest income fell 40% to $6.83 billion. Expenses totaled $12.88 billion, down 3% from the same period last year.</p><p>Write to Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Wells Fargo Quarterly Profit Declines 48%</p>",
