  "text": "<p>Just days after sweeping into Hong Kong on a surprise visit, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon was desperately trying to make amends for boasting that the US bank might outlast China's Communist party.</p> <p>As well as overshadowing last week's visit, Wednesday's public apology underlined that the lender — and its major Wall Street and European rivals — believe they still need to work hard to chase a big prize&#xa0;in China.</p> <p>For western banks, this prize has proved to be elusive so far. Plagued by operational setbacks and prohibitive regulations that have capped investment, JPMorgan's efforts at investment banking in China have involved large costs for meagre returns.</p> <p>Despite investing millions of dollars and hiring dozens of bankers, the company reported a $40m (Rmb255.5m) total loss over the past two years, according to figures reported to Chinese regulators and seen by the Financial Times.</p> <p>The banks are keen to cast their losses in mainland China as a necessary price to pay for a lucrative future. They also point to the fees already reaped from advising Chinese companies on listings in New York and Hong Kong — rewards that would be much harder for the banks to secure without a base on the mainland.</p> <p>But as Beijing threatens to put an end to that revenue stream while at the same time opening up the mainland, Wall Street is hoping its bigger bet will pay off and it can finally make some real money in China itself. &#xa0;</p> <p>“We are building for the future,” Filippo Gori, JPMorgan's chief executive for Asia-Pacific, told the FT. “We are not worried if it takes us one year or 25.”</p> <p>JPMorgan is far from alone in having failed to capitalise on its investments in China. Morgan Stanley's mainland investment bank made profits of just $160,000 in China last year and a combined $33m of losses in the two years previously.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad1a8608-1069-4f9b-bf26-5dd9ae03f0a8\">Goldman Sachs</a> — whose mainland investment bank is 15 years older than JPMorgan's — has made profits of about $30m in total since 2018.</p> <p>In fact, of the seven global banks that own investment banking operations in mainland China, just three — Goldman, UBS and Deutsche Bank — have been profitable in the last three years. The businesses controlled by JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and HSBC are all in the red.</p> <p>The seven banks' Chinese operations made a combined $140m in revenue from investment banking services in 2020, according to the figures reported to regulators. JPMorgan contributed around $600,000 of that.</p> <p>All of the lenders are quick to point out that the domestic reported revenue for their investment banks does not fully represent their wider China banking businesses, such as bond underwriting and advisory work that is booked through different onshore entities, in Hong Kong or elsewhere. None of them disclose total revenues for mainland China.</p> <p>But no matter the caveats, the numbers illustrate that — even after decades in China — global banks have far to go to capture a significant slice of the enormous domestic deals market. </p> <p>That was less of a problem when they could point to the roughly $460m in fees generated in the first half of this year from helping Chinese companies list in Hong Kong and New York, booked in those jurisdictions.</p> <p>“Before now, no one had to do more than US IPOs of Chinese companies to say they had a successful China business,” said the regional head of capital markets at a Wall Street bank in Asia. </p> <p>China's crackdown on overseas listings for its largest companies on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00403ae5-7565-413e-907d-ad46549375ba\">data security concerns</a>, following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13a768b0-1000-4cad-8a03-36a1e66f460b\">disastrous listing</a> of ride-hailing app Didi in June, has left global banks having to find another way of proving that their investment in China — often amid geopolitical tensions — will be worthwhile.</p> <p>But there is reason for hope. In a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">regulatory “big bang”</a> in the last two years, China has opened its financial markets to foreign competition. In January 2020, as part of a trade deal with the US, China permitted global banks to take over the joint ventures through which they were forced to structure their businesses, giving them full access to its $31tn and still rapidly growing capital markets.</p> <p>“The reality is no international bank has made a meaningful impact onshore in China yet . . . but the point is not that important,” said an executive at one of the banks. “Given the continued opening up and maturing of the market and more onshore flows, the opportunity is really emerging now.”</p> <p>In response, the banks have revealed ambitious plans to expand, in some cases aiming to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c74fac6-65fa-4af1-a4a7-211eefac1923\">double headcount</a> and revenue. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have received regulatory approval to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22e8f770-ba64-4c8f-a9f5-a47885d0b7dd\">take full control</a> of their Chinese investment banks and are rapidly growing their advisory, wealth and asset management businesses. &#xa0;</p> <p>“The strategy is first to have all the licenses and controls, then build a platform and the revenues will come,” said Gori. “You accept there will be volatility and headwinds and you follow the clients.”</p> <p>Wall Street is banking on being able to sell its international size, scale and technical abilities to China's fastest growing companies, even as the government forces many of them to rein in their offshore strategies.</p> <p>For JPMorgan, the priority remains global clients doing cross-border deals in China. “It's where we have an edge compared to our domestic competitors . . . The domestic side is something we are building on,” Gori said.</p> <p>An executive close to Goldman Sachs said getting mainland domestic work was an increasingly important part of its strategy. “The size of the domestic underwriting business is enormous. But it's complicated, highly regulated and you need to put in a lot of resources to play.”</p> <p>The banks face an uphill battle, putting to work global underwriting standards of quality and independence in a far less developed and faster-moving market.</p> <p>Their ambitions also run up against national banking giants such as Citic Securities and CICC, whose investment banking businesses make more than $1bn a year. And despite dominating league tables for Chinese companies doing deals abroad, the global banks' market share of China's capital markets has flatlined.</p> <p>“Banks in Europe and the US are used to a kind of centralised decision-making based on the highest regulatory standards globally,” said one former executive who walked away from a senior role at a global bank in China.</p> <p>“This has conflicts with the current practices in China, where sometimes you don't even have rules written down. I didn't feel like we could develop fast enough to catch the opportunities. Eventually this comes down to a clash of philosophies between two civilisations.”</p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong 2021 'Global banks have bet on ‘big bang' in China but will it pay off?'
