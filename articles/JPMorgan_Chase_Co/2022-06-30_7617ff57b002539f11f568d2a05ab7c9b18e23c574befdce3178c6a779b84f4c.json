One of its primary goals is to increase the amount of Black-owned media, including by acquiring existing high-profile media brands and adding more multicultural voices and influence, Mr. Montaque said.</p><p>Group Black helps advertisers buy ads with its member companies, which includes outfits such as Essence Communications Inc., the publisher of Essence magazine, which Mr. Dennis bought from Time Inc. in 2018; Holler Technologies Inc., which specializes in stickers and GIFs for digital messages and posts, which Mr. Montaque founded; esports startup PlayVS; and entertainment news sites Shade Room LLC and Baller Alert Inc. The collective has grown to about 200 companies, according to a spokeswoman.</p><p>Group Black said it didn't own these member companies, but works with them on matters like ad commitments.</p><p>The company has attracted about $500 million in ad spending commitments from companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co., as well as ad holding companies WPP, Dentsu and Interpublic Group of Cos, according to a spokeswoman.</p><p>Group Black's talks with BDG are preliminary and could fall apart, people familiar with the discussions said.
