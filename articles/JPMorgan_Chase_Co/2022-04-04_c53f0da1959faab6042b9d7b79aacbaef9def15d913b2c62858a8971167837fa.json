  "text": "<p>Russia has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e1670e8-c035-4cef-af59-3691414546a1\">committing war crimes</a> after the dead bodies of hundreds of unarmed civilians were discovered in areas recently occupied by Russian forces near the Ukraine capital Kyiv.</p> <p>Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, vowed to create a “mechanism of justice” to investigate alleged atrocities by the retreating Russian soldiers in the city of Bucha, 25km north-west of Kyiv. </p> <p>“The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,” Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday.</p> <p>Iryna Venedyktova, Ukraine's prosecutor-general, said 410 bodies of civilians had been recovered from the Kyiv region.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch, the New York-based group, said it had documented&#xa0;several cases of unlawful violence it described as “apparent war crimes”, including in the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions.</p> <p>Pictures of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bb2ce56-ae93-48c8-ba89-40aec21cb6aa\">charred corpses and reports of mass graves</a> prompted outrage from western leaders yesterday. Images from Bucha were “unbearable”, French president Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter. German chancellor Olaf Scholz described “terrible and grisly” scenes emerging from the town, mentioning “roads littered with corpses”.</p> <p>“You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,” said US secretary of state Antony Blinken, urging the global community against becoming “numb”. Liz Truss, British foreign secretary, said she was “appalled by atrocities in Bucha and other towns”, adding that the UK was collecting evidence of war crimes.</p> <p>The EU said it was preparing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84b82726-d4d0-446c-a409-f61037686315\">introduce more sanctions</a> against Moscow after the reports emerged. </p> <p>Russia's ministry of defence denied accusations of murdering civilians, describing the claims as a “provocation”, adding that photos and videos of atrocities are “another production of the Kyiv regime for the western media”.</p> <p>China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, offered a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b11fc9ce-569f-4fcc-a26d-e3f0efa34829\">muted response</a> on Monday. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Russian forces continued their bombardment of critical infrastructure in the south of the country. The besieged city of Mariupol remained a target and the port of Odesa, further to the west, was targeted for the first time over the weekend. The mayor of Mykolayiv, 130km north-east of Odesa, said Russian troops launched several rocket attacks on his city earlier today.</p> <h1>More on Ukraine: </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Nato:</strong> Just four months ago, the idea of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83b5041b-6bcf-49de-b180-43c354a3302d\">Finland joining Nato</a> this year would have seemed far fetched.

Here's the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Jamie Dimon warns of ‘volatile markets' </strong>JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, in his annual letter to shareholders, has warned of “very volatile markets” to come as the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25675232-811b-49b7-9d8c-5e1fe11c62bd\">tightens monetary policy</a>. Meanwhile, Mary Daly, president of the Fed's San Francisco branch, made the case <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94f23e69-33d4-4688-b5b0-c996fa0d77f1\">for a half-point interest rate rise</a> in an interview with the Financial Times. </p> <p><strong>2.

Part of the jump in executive pay stemmed from bonuses paused or slashed in 2020 during the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>3. Carrie Lam says she will not seek a second term</strong> Hong Kong's chief executive said she <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fc93398-8b1f-4510-9b85-5ad676195cbf\">would not seek a second five-year term</a> in office, signalling the end of her tumultuous tenure as the territory's most senior leader. Lam's resignation came shortly after Hong Kong, which has followed China's strict zero Covid policy, was rocked by a disastrous Omicron outbreak that peaked last month.</p> <p><strong>4. Costa Rica elects anti-establishment candidate as president</strong> Rodrigo Chaves, a former World Bank official accused of sexual harassment, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23e4d7df-88d4-4db7-b131-75eb839209d8\">is on course</a> to become the next president of Costa Rica.

China changes audit secrecy rules in bid to stop US delistings</strong> In a significant concession to pressure from Washington, Beijing has revised confidentiality laws in efforts to stop about 270 Chinese companies from being delisted from US exchanges. This is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3d52cf3-a9b7-4a59-99e4-21cdaaebebe6\">China's first major rule change</a> to allow disclosure of financial information outside the country.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Outlook for markets</strong> The yield on two-year US government bonds exceeded the 30-year for the first time since 2007, as investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/771b0ece-b544-4236-bd87-fe26f18999ee\">continued to fret about the prospect of a recession</a> in America caused by a rapid rise in interest rates to calm inflation.
