  "text": "<p>See: Fed Jackson Hole preview: Powell to stress a recession won't stop Fed's fight against high inflation</p><p>However,the minutes of the July FOMC meetingshowed that Fed officials agreed that it was necessary to move their benchmark interest rate high enough to slow the economy to combat high inflation and then bring it back down to its 2% target. But according to JPMorgan, the danger of recession has already exceeded the risk of inflation, and staying at current levels could inflict long-term economic damage.</p><p>\"If the Fed recognizes this in the next few weeks, they will moderate the pace of monetary tightening, potentially giving a further boost to U.S. bond and stock markets,\" Kelly said in Monday's client note. \"If they do not, then interest rates could be higher in the short run but probably lower next year. The ultimate destination is likely the same either way â€” a slow-growing economy with moderate inflation and interest rates.\"</p><p>\"However, the more volatile economic and market cycle that could be unleashed by an overly aggressive Federal Reserve could lead to a further near-term reassessment of valuations that would likely favor value over growth, and, by ultimately sinking the U.S. dollar, favor international over U.S. equities,\" according to Kelly.</p><p>See: Beware of a 'bear trap' retreat in stocks after the big summer rally, strategists warn</p><p>U.S. stocks on Monday recorded the worst trading day in two months as investors worried the Federal Reserve may not pivot away from sharply higher interest rates to fight inflation.
