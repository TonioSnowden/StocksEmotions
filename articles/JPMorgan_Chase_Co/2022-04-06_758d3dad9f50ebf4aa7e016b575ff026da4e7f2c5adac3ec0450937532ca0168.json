  "text": "<p>That compares with around 40% around the beginning of March and 5% at the beginning of February, according to Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the main clearinghouse for European credit-default swaps.</p><p>On Monday, the U.S. blocked Russia from using U.S. banks to channel payments on its dollar-denominated bonds, the day that $649.2 million of payments came due. The move aimed to deprive Moscow of access to offshore deposits, forcing it to deplete its cash pile.</p><p>\"Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury said.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the correspondent bank for two bonds Russia needed to service Monday, declined to process the $649.2 million in payments because the U.S. Treasury did not grant approval, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier. Russia's finance ministry said it had disbursed the debt payments through its national clearinghouse.</p><p>Russia has 30 days from Monday to remit funds to investors' accounts before defaulting on the debt and triggering credit-default swaps.</p><p>After JPMorgan declined to process the payments, the Russian finance ministry said Wednesday that it had placed ruble-equivalent amounts due to foreign bondholders that Moscow deemed unfriendly in special accounts at the National Settlement Depository. Owners of the accounts will not be able to exchange their rubles into foreign currencies until Russia can access its foreign currency accounts again, according to the finance ministry statement.</p><p>Russia placed similar restrictions on owners of ruble-denominated bonds it restructured after its most recent default in 1998.</p><p>\"It's hard to see Russia avoiding a sovereign default,\" said Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist for BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London.</p><p>There is roughly $4.5 billion of credit-default swaps tied specifically to the Russian government, and an additional $1.5 billion located inside derivative indexes, according to JPMorgan.</p><p>Before this week's restrictions were enacted, Russia had managed to stay current on $732 million in sovereign debt payments since mid-March due to carve-outs in U.S. sanctions allowing banks and bondholders to process and receive payments until May 25.</p><p>Russia has also been taking advantage of alternative currency fallbacks in sovereign debts it borrowed since its 2014 annexation of Crimea to allow the government to make payments in rubles. But a number of legacy debts, including the bond that matured on Monday, only allow dollar payments.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com and Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com</p><p>Russia, U.S. Face-Off Boosts Default Risk</p>",
