  "text": "<p>Investors seeking refuge from volatile financial markets have been piling into the dollar as a safe bet, driving its surge to multidecade highs. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate increases are also boosting the dollar. Money managers and hedge funds tend to favor currencies with fast-acting central banks because they believe those countries will either keep inflation under control or step in to shore up financial markets when they are in trouble.</p><p>Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock Inc., said the dollar's unpredictable swings make buy-or-sell decisions harder based on daily or weekly price movements.</p><p>\"The persistent strength of the dollar as a reflection of tighter monetary policy and a lower global risk tolerance makes you want to stay more cautious in risk-taking,\" Mr. Rieder said.</p><p>For companies doing business across multiple countries, a strong dollar means reviewing their currency exposure. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 reported a total of $7.42 billion more in foreign-exchange effects in the first quarter compared with the prior-year period, according to FactSet. They reported a combined $12.57 billion less in gains from hedges and derivatives.</p><p>The U.S. dollar functions as the world's reserve currency and is used for trading commodities in the global economy. The dollar's strength can ripple through financial markets and the economy in unexpected ways.</p><p>When the dollar rises sharply, it can hurt America's major trading partners by making their currencies relatively weak in comparison. It can also spur inflation in those other countries, since more of their currency is needed to buy foreign goods or import energy.</p><p>At home, a stronger dollar can hit exports by making U.S. products more expensive in overseas markets. U.S. corporations such as Microsoft Corp. recently cut earnings guidance, citing the dollar's gains. In the medium term, a stronger dollar can actually slow the U.S. economy, hedge-fund managers and analysts said, complicating the job of the Federal Reserve. A rising dollar, in effect, has the same impact on markets as a Fed rate increase, according to analysts.</p><p>Analysts estimate the Fed's so-called real broad dollar index could reach a new 21st century high by the end of July.</p><p>The dollar's rise has been most pronounced against the Japanese yen, partially because of Japan's continued easy-money policy. The Bank of Japan has rejected calls to tighten borrowing conditions, putting it at odds with other global central banks. The dollar is up nearly 18% against the yen this half, its largest first-half percentage gain on record.</p><p>Financial markets have been turbulent this year, adjusting to shocks including Russia's war on Ukraine, ongoing Covid lockdowns in China and global central banks rapidly raising interest rates to rein in consumer prices. Some investors are concerned that tighter borrowing conditions—meant to damp inflation—will push the U.S. and other countries into recession. In June, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists doubled the odds of a U.S. recession over the next year to 30% from 15%.</p><p>\"We are increasingly concerned that the Fed will feel compelled to respond forcefully to high headline inflation and consumer inflation expectations if energy prices rise further, even if activity slows sharply,\" Goldman's top economist, Jan Hatzius, wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>But even though the outlook of the U.S. economy remains uncertain, investors contend it is more resilient than other economies including the U.K. and Europe, where high inflation coupled with low growth prospects could lead to so-called stagflation.</p><p>Investors in recent years have viewed the euro as a haven during volatile markets, but the war between Russia and Ukraine has made it less appealing. The euro remains far from record lows, but it has still declined more than 7.5% against the dollar in the first half of the year.</p><p>Many Wall Street analysts say the dollar has peaked. Some estimate the dollar will lose gains by September—if inflation numbers cool—and once the Fed's path becomes clearer. Over 40% of investors surveyed by JPMorgan this week said they expect the U.S. Dollar Index—which currently trades around 105—will end 2022 near current levels. Another 36% bet it would be lower.</p><p>\"Foreign exchange is not a linear world. At some point, things flip,\" said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman. \"I personally have a bias to short the dollar at some point.\"</p><p>Write to Julia-Ambra Verlaine at Julia.Verlaine@wsj.com</p><p>It Was a Lousy Second Quarter—Except for the U.S. Dollar</p>",
