  "text": "<p>\n  10 YEARS AGO </p><p>\n  In June 2012, British bank Barclays PLC agreed to pay $453 million in penalties for its role in the Libor rigging scandal. </p><p>\n  The malfeasance involved other banks, including JPMorgan Chase, NatWest, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. Together bankers manipulated a key interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) by recording incorrect borrowing costs. </p><p>\n  That might seem like a technical problem, but $300 trillion of global financial contracts relied on these Libor rates, including complex derivatives as well as home mortgages and auto loans. </p><p>\n  \"Some counterparties were paying too much on their loans, others too little,\" says Pete Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research. </p><p>\n  However, Mr. Earle isn't surprised, given previous dodgy Wall Street antics, including Treasury bond rigging and timing mutual-fund sales. \"Whenever a group of large financial institutions get together a 'pick price,' you are asking for trouble,\" he says. </p><p>\n  The scandal prompted the development of a new benchmark, SOFR, the secured overnight financing rate, which will be transparent based on observed transactions. By June 2023, SOFR should have wholly replaced Libor. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  25 YEARS AGO </p><p>\n  Europeans See March to One Currency Hit New Stumbling Blocks </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  TWO YEARS AGO </p><p>\n  Dow Falls 1,800 on Virus Worries </p><p></p>",
