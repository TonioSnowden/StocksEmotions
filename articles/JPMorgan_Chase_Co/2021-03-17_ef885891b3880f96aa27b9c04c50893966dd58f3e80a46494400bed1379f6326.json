  "text": "<p>Tech is awash with cash in the first few months of 2021. </p> <p>There has already been a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9442066-1bbe-4cb3-b668-af6a9958a324\">record investment of close to $8bn</a>&#xa0;in UK start-ups, as we reported on Tuesday. Now, blank-cheque companies have just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/321400c1-9c4d-40ac-b464-3a64c1c4ca80\">surpassed the fundraising </a>they achieved in the whole of last year.</p> <p>Special purpose acquisition companies have raised $79.4bn globally since the start of the year, eclipsing the $79.3bn that flooded into vehicles in 2020, according to data provider Refinitiv, as of Tuesday night. So far in 2021, 264 new Spacs have been launched, overtaking last year's record 256.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of Spacs this year — 257, which raised $78.4bn — have listed on US exchanges, although activity is increasing outside of North America. In Europe, Amsterdam is emerging as a hub for blank-cheque vehicles.</p> <p>Investors have been keen to have a stake in fast growing tech sectors such as fintech — the online trading platform <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37ab6294-0e8e-4b89-846d-84822a1e61d9\">eToro on Tuesday</a> was the latest company to take the Spac route to market. Space, aviation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c56b047e-2b07-4976-858b-e14c845cb7a2\">flying taxis </a>and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/688d8472-c404-42d6-88b7-fbd475e50f7c\">electric cars</a> have also proved popular areas and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93c86820-0058-4a2a-9093-0f4f327b7a1b\">Greg Meyer in New York reports</a> Spacs are now plugging into electric vehicle charging companies.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Uber's UK drivers become workers</strong><br>Uber is<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d39472b-12a1-4754-bb11-b9149dab2872\"> reclassifying its UK drivers</a> as workers, falling partly in line with a recent court ruling, but probably setting up a fresh round of disputes over what should be considered “working time” in the gig economy. Drivers will receive minimum wage, pension and holiday rights, but the concession is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a4844d-62ab-4930-8d01-0258df54474d\">“a day late and a dollar short”, </a>according to claimants. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30f870a6-c613-4a59-aa16-b06a405b7641\">FT's editorial board points out</a> the ride-hailing company will only classify “working time” as when drivers are assigned to trips. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68718de3-b25f-47d6-8f51-4df1f66d8b1e\">We've an analysis</a> of what Uber's move means for the gig economy.</p> <p><strong>2. Amazon to offer healthcare service</strong> <br>After effectively<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6cc2ec5-5b6e-4d7c-ba62-66f13c481524\"> pulling the plug</a> earlier this year on its Haven healthcare joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1059c1fe-3291-4af0-b927-48ff72db6af6\">expanding its internal healthcare service </a>to other companies, saying on Wednesday that it plans to offer video calls with doctors to “millions” of people across the US. Appointments should take place within a minute of booking them on the Amazon Care smartphone app.</p> <p><strong>3. Pinduoduo chair steps down, Baidu's new listing</strong><br>Colin Huang, the founder of highflying Chinese ecommerce group Pinduoduo, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94a39cee-fc41-44c7-9abe-a79ffa30ab96\">unexpectedly quit</a> his executive roles to explore “new, long-term opportunities”. New York-listed search engine Baidu is set to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e74d8f51-df67-4644-8b6c-07e96446260c\">raise more than $3bn </a>in a Hong Kong stock market listing, marking the latest “homecoming” share sale.</p> <p><strong>4. How Stripe became the Valley's most prized asset</strong><br>Underpinning a near-tripling of Stripe's valuation in the past year to $95bn is a belief from investors that the digitisation of commerce and payments still has some way to run.<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bfda026-df9d-42e4-8679-c26a072e0522\"> Here's our financial stripdown </a>of Stripe.</p> <p><strong>Samsung warns of chip ‘imbalance'</strong><br>Samsung Electronics has sounded the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e5e2d0f-3aa4-412b-898c-15acda4adb2e\">alarm over a “serious imbalance”</a> in the semiconductor industry, the latest warning that a chip shortage disrupting carmakers threatens to spill over into the broader technology sector. “There's a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,” said Koh Dong-jin, the co-chief executive who heads Samsung's mobile business unit, at a shareholder meeting on Wednesday. The company also revealed it might<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung\"> not be able to ship</a> a Galaxy Note phone in 2021&#xa0;</p> <h2>Tech tools — Samsung Galaxy A-series</h2> <p>Samsung was also staging its latest Unpacked event on Wednesday and one product category it certainly will ship this year is its <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-a/\">next A series</a> mid-priced phones: the<a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/the-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-and-a72-make-innovation-accessible-to-all\"> Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4\">The Verge reports</a> the company isn't sharing US pricing or availability yet, but has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52, €429 for the A52 5G (£399) and €449 (£419) for the A72. Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at&#xa0;Uswitch.com, says the phones are less than a third of the price of the heavyweight S21 Ultra: </p> <p>“The A52 follows in the footsteps of the A51, which won global acclaim when it launched at the start of last year, while adding the option of fifth-generation connectivity. Both the battery life and processing power in the standard and 5G versions of the A52 have been boosted, and the display boasts a 120Hz refresh rate that betters the iPhone 12.”&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Spac fundraising overtakes 2020's' FT.com 17 March.
