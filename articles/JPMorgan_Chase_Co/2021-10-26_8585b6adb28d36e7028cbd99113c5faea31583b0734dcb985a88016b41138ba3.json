An Equitable spokesman said the company wouldn't elaborate on the nature of the communications. Mr. de Oliveira couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>France's AXA SA spun out Equitable Holdings, with its majority stake in AllianceBernstein, in 2018. Equitable continues to own a majority of the asset manager. In 2019, Mr. de Oliveira was named independent chairman of both companies.</p><p>Mr. de Oliveira has also served on AXA's board, and by late Monday afternoon the insurer's website still listed him as a director.

The French company tapped former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. executive Seth Bernstein as Mr. Kraus's successor. Mr. de Oliveira, a former colleague of Mr. Bernstein's at JPMorgan, joined AllianceBernstein's board in 2017.</p><p>Ms. Lamm is an adviser to numerous private-equity and venture-capital firms focused on insurance-technology startups.</p><p>She is a former executive at consulting and insurance brokerage firm Marsh McLennan, where she headed its Enterprise Risk Management and was chief economist.</p><p>Equitable shares fell 0.3%, while AllianceBernstein rose 1.2%.</p><p>Thomas Gallagher, a stock analyst with Evercore ISI, said Equitable's statement gives \"us comfort that the resignation was not due to any adverse financial impacts at the company.\"</p><p>Mr. Gallagher said Ms. Lamm-Tennant's experience in risk management and role in shaping Equitable's environmental, social and governance strategy are important \"in the current economic and social climates.\"</p>",
