  "text": "<p>Major central banks are expected to further lift interest rates during coming meetings as price pressures show little signs of easing. Inflation figures in the U.K. and Canada came in above expectations this week. Germany's producer prices rose strongly in September from a year earlier, driven by higher energy prices, the German statistics office Destatis said Thursday.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times this year and is likely to increase its benchmark federal-funds rate by another 0.75 percentage point at its meeting next month as it tries to bring down high inflation.</p><p>\"At the moment, we keep getting upside surprises on inflation everywhere you look,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"No one really has a good grasp yet of where the central banks—particularly the Fed—are going to be able to stop.\"</p><p>The uncertainty around both inflation and the extent of the Fed's monetary tightening is at the core of what's been weighing on markets in recent days, according to Arthur Laffer Jr., president of Laffer Tengler Investments, a Nashville, Tenn.-based registered investment adviser that manages more than $1 billion in assets.</p><p>\"Markets are a little bit stunned that the Fed has shown that it's going to stay the course at least through year-end,\" Mr. Laffer said. \"If these inflation numbers don't come down and they don't come down consistently over several months, you are not going to get a pivot anytime soon.\"</p><p>Investors are also trying to assess if higher inflation and tightening financial conditions will feed through to earnings season. J.P. Morgan's Mr. Gimber said he is paying attention to how companies are affected by wage pressure and higher input costs and if those costs can be passed on to consumers.</p><p>Stocks have been volatile in recent sessions, buoyed by a batch of mixed though better-than-expected earnings results. Still, some investors believe that earnings expectations are too high across the board and a downward recalibration is likely ahead.</p><p>\"There's probably a bit more limited downside in the market even if earnings expectations come down,\" said Ralph Bassett, head of investments, Americas at Abrdn. \"We just don't think we're at that process where estimates bottomed and valuation looks extremely compelling. We think we're just likely to witness a lot of volatility over the next six months.\"</p><p>U.K. assets rallied, before moderating, after British Prime Minister Liz Truss said Thursday she would resign following weeks of political turmoil. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.K. government bond rose to 3.910% from 3.876% Wednesday, while the British pound rose 0.1% against the dollar.</p><p>Tesla shares fell 7.3% after the electric-car maker cut its full-year growth expectations. Whirlpool and Snap are slated to post quarterly results after the market close.</p><p>Shares of AT&amp;T added 7.5% after the telecommunications giant raised its outlook for profit and wireless revenue.</p><p>Labor Department data showed that 214,000 workers filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 15, down from the week prior. The National Association of Realtors reported sales of previously owned homes fell for an eighth straight month to 4.7 million in September, the lowest level since May 2020.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasurys ticked up to 4.223% from 4.127% Wednesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark, slipped 0.03% to $92.38 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 shed 0.9%. The Japanese yen hit a 32-year low of 150 to the dollar. Japan's currency has fallen this year as its central bank has vowed to keep its monetary policy ultraloose.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Vicky Ge Huang at Vicky.Huang@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Fall With Inflation, Earnings in Focus</p>",
