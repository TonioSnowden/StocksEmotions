  "title": "Oatly upgraded at JPMorgan on attractive valuation, but analysts say the company could miss sales expectations",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan maintained its $21 price target, which implies a more-than 40% upside to current levels.</p><p>Oatly OTLY stock was trading Friday below $15 after falling more than a third, down 37.3%, over the past three months, while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 1.9% for the period.</p><p>The company went public on May 20 after its initial public offering priced at $17 a share.</p><p>Read: Weight gain during COVID-19, especially among younger consumers, is driving changes in the way Americans eat and dress</p><p>“Yes, there is a decent chance that sales come in a few million dollars shy of consensus this quarter, which is never a good look for a newly public growth story,” analysts wrote. “But we believe the miss would not be driven by reduced demand but rather, by&#xa0;the sell side not properly heeding management's tone about the sales cadence.”</p><p>The FactSet consensus is for third-quarter sales of $186.9 million and a loss of 10 cents per share.</p><p>“We also think&#xa0;the risk of a 3Q revenue miss is increasingly baked into buy side expectations,” JPMorgan said.</p><p>“Lastly – and perhaps most importantly – we expect the company to reiterate its annual revenue target when it reports 3Q; if it does,&#xa0;the implication will be that 4Q top line estimates need to&#xa0;rise. So we don't see the upcoming 3Q21 earnings release/guide as an unmitigated negative; indeed the positive impact of guidance theoretically could more than offset a modest 3Q miss.”&#xa0;</p><p>See: JPMorgan downgrades Conagra and upgrades Hormel, as inflation fears should keep investors in many large food companies on the sidelines</p><p>Though JPMorgan is optimistic about Oatly, it's more downbeat on other food producers. Analysts downgraded Conagra Brands Inc. CAG and upgraded Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, putting a number of large-cap food producers at neutral.</p><p>In the Conagra downgrade note, analysts explained that they “believe strong revenue growth can overcome a number of sins, including the major one of 2021: cost inflation.”</p><p>Analysts think Oatly is well-positioned to manage this challenge.</p><p>“We also hear concerns about inflation, particularly oats, but we remind readers that&#xa0;Oatly can lock in many prices well in advance,” JPMorgan says.</p><p>“We would not be surprised if it bought most of its oat needs deep into 2022. Of course,&#xa0;oats are but a small part of Oatly's total [cost of goods sold] basket, anyway, and we think this company has a great deal of pricing power if needed.”</p>",
