  "text": "<p>* The yield on the 2-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD02Y rose to 4.721% after ending Thursday's session at 4.699% â€” its highest finish based on 3 p.m. ET levels since July 25, 2007, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>* The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose to 4.164% versus 4.123% Thursday afternoon.</p><p>* The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y advanced to 4.237%, compared with 4.151% late Thursday.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from 3.5%. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected payrolls to rise by 205,000, with the unemployment rate staying at 3.5%.</p><p>In October, wages grew 0.4%. Average hourly pay rose slightly in September to $32.58, lowering the increase over the past year to 4.7% from 5%.</p><p>Stocks and bonds extended selloffs after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated interest rates would need to rise significantly above where officials had previously expected in the face of persistent inflation. He noted that the labor market continued to run hot, adding to inflation worries.</p><p>Analysts said investors initially took some solace in the rise in the unemployment rate and perhaps the slowdown in the annual pace of wage growth, but short-dated yields subsequently ticked back to the upside.</p><p>What analysts say</p><p>\"As labor demand continues to cool, the Fed should take some comfort in the fact that wage growth still lags overall inflation and is decelerating, reducing the threat of the pass-through of wages to overall inflation. For investors, this report signals continued resilience in the labor market amidst recession fears, without additional warning signs on inflation,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note.</p><p>2-year Treasury yields builds on 15-year high after October jobs data</p>",
