  "text": "<p>   Chinese regulators approved Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s application to take full ownership of its local securities business, another step in China's gradual opening of its financial system to major players from the U.S. and elsewhere. </p><p>   Goldman had sought approval in December 2020 to increase its stake in a domestic Chinese business that it has co-owned since 2004. The bank said that China's financial markets regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, had given its assent. </p><p>   The securities unit, Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co., will be renamed Goldman Sachs (China) Securities Co. </p><p>   Goldman didn't disclose how much it is paying to acquire the 49% stake in the venture </p><p>   Wall Street firms, including investment banks and money managers, have long sought a bigger footprint in China, and the U.S. financial sector emerged as one of the winners from a trade deal signed by Washington and Beijing last year. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley is among other banks that have since secured majority ownership of their local securities ventures. In August, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. secured permission to take full control of its equivalent operation, in a first for an international firm. </p><p>   Global investment banks have a very small share of the equities trading and underwriting business in China and are eager to play a larger role in what is already one of the world's largest stock markets. </p><p>   As of August, the Shanghai exchange hosted companies with a combined market capitalization of $7.63 trillion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, more than any other exchange outside the U.S. Companies valued an additional $5.74 trillion are listed in Shenzhen. </p><p>   Asset managers have also moved to take advantage of new opportunities. </p><p>   Last month, BlackRock Inc. said it had raised roughly $1 billion for the first-ever mutual fund solely run by a foreign firm that is allowed to sell to Chinese individuals. </p><p>   Goldman has made inroads into China outside of investment banking. </p><p>   In May, mainland regulators approved a wealth-management joint venture between the U.S. institution and state-backed bank Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd., in which Goldman will own 51%. </p><p></p>",
