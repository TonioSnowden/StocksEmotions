  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- After two decades hauling cement and fuel to oil rigs in the North Sea, Atlantic Discovery faced the end of the line in 2015 when energy markets crashed and the ship was dispatched to an Edinburgh scrapyard. </p><p>   Now the vessel is back plying the waves under a new owner. Tricked out with high-lift cranes and an upgraded positioning system, it started servicing the U.K.'s offshore wind farms in 2019. </p><p>   Atlantic Discovery is one of a growing number of vessels catering to offshore wind farms, which are proliferating as the world reduces its reliance on fossil fuels. The need to finance the ships has lured money managers chasing investments that check the environmentally friendly box and provide yield. Their interest suggests appetite for cleaner investments extends beyond the ubiquitous green bonds of recent years. </p><p>   Ships clear the seabed of debris, lay foundations and build turbines -- often far from shore in treacherous conditions. A financing gap exists because banks have pulled back from the shipping industry after losses since the 2008-09 financial crisis. </p><p>   Galya Petkova sees this in her job at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA, leasing vessels to service turbines. She is encountering more private funds that own or finance ships compared with three years ago, she says. </p><p>   Investors include shipping-dedicated and infrastructure funds and multistrategy generalists. They lend to shipowners or join with them to build and own ships. Atlantic Discovery's overhaul, undertaken by owner Castle Ship Management Ltd., used loans from private individuals and a fund. Castle Ship, which is raising capital to expand and upgrade its fleet, expects private funds to contribute most. </p><p>   Vessels that install turbines can cost between $250 million and $350 million to build, while those that service them can cost up to $50 million, said Andreas Povlsen, head of the maritime team at Hayfin Capital Management LLP. </p><p>   Some managers are currently participating in a tender to provide ships for Dogger Bank wind farm, off the northeast coast of England, whose owners SSE Renewables and Equinor ASA say it will be the world's biggest. J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Marine Capital Ltd. and North Star, a Scottish shipping operator owned by Basalt Infrastructure Partners LLP, have submitted bids, according to people familiar with the process. </p><p>   Vessels can be retrofitted after serving oil-and-gas rigs or built from scratch, according to Elbe Financial Solutions, a firm that previously invested in traditional ships. Two years ago it shifted to an environmental maritime strategy that includes offshore wind vessels. </p><p>   Belinda Adye, a partner at consulting firm Marsoft Inc., says investing in green shipping assets is a priority for most private funds. </p><p>   Most offshore wind farms are in Europe and Asia. The U.S. is on track to become one of the largest markets, though overseas investors face stringent regulation there. Some 26,000 offshore wind turbines will be active globally in 2030, nearly four times the current number, says shipbroker Clarksons Platou. </p><p>   Clarksons valued the global fleet of vessels at 11 billion euros, equivalent to $13.3 billion, last year, and says it must rise to 23 billion euros by 2025 to satisfy demand. </p><p>   Yet the sector's complexity requires niche know-how, said Tony Foster, chief executive of Marine Capital, an asset manager that owns and runs ships. </p><p>   EnTrust Global, with $19 billion in total assets, will soon start investing in offshore wind support vessels, said portfolio manager Svein Engh. </p><p>   Wind-turbine installation vessels attach to the seabed and lift themselves out of the water. Using that stable platform, a crane and other machines install the turbine's foundation, construct a tower and attach blades that capture wind power. </p><p>   There are 16 such ships in the world, according to Jens Egenberg, offshore-renewables analyst at Clarksons. They tend to be a riskier bet for investors because they regularly need to find new farms under construction, and can return as much as 20%. </p><p>   Vessels that transfer technicians to maintain and repair turbines are typically a safer investment because they are chartered for years at a time, producing at least high single-digit returns. </p><p>   In a sign the overall fleet is set to grow, New York-listed Scorpio Bulkers Inc. plans to sell its dry-bulk vessels, which transport coal and iron ore, and replace them with turbine-installation vessels. </p><p>   \"There's nothing uncertain about the global energy transition toward renewables,\" said Chief Executive Emanuele Lauro, adding that existing vessels won't be able to handle the bigger turbines of the future. Another impetus for Scorpio's change of tack: Many investors aren't allowed to own coal-related companies. </p><p>   To be sure, most offshore-wind ships emit their own pollutants, and a push is under way to reduce these. </p><p>   Basalt, which manages more than $4 billion, in 2017 bought North Star, which works on North Sea oil platforms. With oil production in the region in long-term decline, it is rejigging to serve wind farms. </p><p></p>",
