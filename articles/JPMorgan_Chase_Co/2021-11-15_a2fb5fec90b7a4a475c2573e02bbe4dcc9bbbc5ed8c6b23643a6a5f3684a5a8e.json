  "text": "<p>European banks came charging into the US decades ago in search of the American dream. Success has proved to be elusive. Tough competition and low rates are prompting remaining contenders to question stateside commitments. </p> <p>France's BNP Paribas is reportedly shopping around for a buyer for its US unit, Bank of the West. HSBC sold its east coast branches to Citizens Financial in May. Spain's BBVA announced a retreat from the US retail market with the sale of its operations to PNC Financial last year. </p> <p>There is an inevitability to the retreat. US banking heavyweights such as JPMorgan and Bank of America have fortified their main street operations in recent years. Persistently low rates have undercut one of the main reasons European lenders came to the US in the first place. </p> <p>The pandemic has compounded the pain. Tepid loan demand has made it tough for smaller lenders to profit from the flood of new deposits. Squeezed between big US banks and proliferating fintechs, European banks must bulk up or otherwise call it quits.</p> <p>The same forces that are making life hard for European lenders in the New World are driving a wave of consolidation among US regional banks. This makes them eager buyers.</p> <p>PNC acquired BBVA's US operations for $11.6bn, or 1.1 times book value. San Francisco-based Bank of the West, <a href=\"https://www.bankofthewest.com/-/media/pdf/about-us/quarterly-fact-sheet.pdf\">with $99.2bn of assets</a> as of June 30, is <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/\">similar in size</a>. If BNP can fetch a similar multiple for the business, which has a book value of about $14bn according to S&amp;P CIQ, it could pull in over $15bn from a sale.</p> <p>A sale could boost the common equity Tier 1 ratio of France's largest bank by 100 basis points, while shaving just 4 per cent off its earnings, according to analysts at S&amp;P Global. A deal should also lift BNP's return on equity, which stood at just <a href=\"https://invest.bnpparibas/en/document/3q21-slides\">9.2 per cent</a> during the third quarter.</p> <p>A war chest of $15bn would give BNP firepower to expand elsewhere. But takeovers are tricky in Europe's Balkanised lending markets. And the lesson of the US is that retail banking styles, like retail brands themselves, do not always travel.</p><p>Source:  2021 'BNP Paribas/US: how the West was lost' FT.com 15 November.
