  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley has long been dubbed Wall Street's “smallest big bank”. This moniker needs updating. During the pandemic, the investment bank led by James Gorman vaulted past both Goldman Sachs and Citigroup in market valuation.&#xa0;</p> <p>Expect the divergence to widen further. In a tough quarter, when rivals' bottom lines were hit by the collapse in investment banking revenues and tougher comparatives, Morgan Stanley has outshone peers.</p> <p>The firm cranked out <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/content/dam/msdotcom/en/about-us-ir/shareholder/1q2022.pdf\">$14.8bn in revenue</a> during the first three months of 2022. That makes it Morgan Stanley's second-best quarter ever, behind last year's blowout first quarter. Net profits — down 11 per cent — compare favourably with 42 per cent declines reported at both JPMorgan and Goldman. Morgan Stanley's tangible return on equity of 19.8 per cent is now the highest among the big Wall Street banks.</p> <p>As at Goldman, trading was the surprise bright spot this earnings season. Russia's invasion of Ukraine created volatile market conditions that kept trading desks across Wall Street busy during the quarter. At Morgan Stanley, trading revenue came in at $6.1bn, an increase from last year's bumper quarter, confounding analysts' expectations of a 19 per cent decline.</p> <p>Similarities end there. Goldman, despite recent efforts to diversify away from Wall Street with a push into consumer banking and wealth management, remains heavily exposed to feast-or-famine, market-driven activity. Trading and investment banking accounted for 80 per cent of its revenue during the first quarter, compared to 51 per cent at Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>For investors, the question is which Wall Street bank is best positioned to grow when current volatility wanes. Higher interest rates and the return of loan growth will benefit big lenders such as JPMorgan and Bank of America. But that will take time to feed through and can be derailed if overly aggressive tightening tips the US economy into a recession.</p> <p>Investors should prefer Morgan Stanley's “three-legged stool”: wealth management; investment including retail broking; and institutional securities, which encompasses trading and dealmaking. The first two continued to be steady earners during the first quarter. Managing money for the affluent positions Morgan Stanley to do well in good times as well as bad.</p><p>Source:  2022 'US banks: Morgan's solid virtues outshine Goldman's glitz' FT.com 14 April.
