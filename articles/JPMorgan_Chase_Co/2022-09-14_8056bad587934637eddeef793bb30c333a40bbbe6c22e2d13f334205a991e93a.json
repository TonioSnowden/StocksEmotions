  "text": "<p>Citi received more than 3,000 applications from graduates of top universities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. The 27 junior analysts chosen represent 22 nationalities and speak 15 different languages, including English, which will be the branch's main idiom for doing business. After two years, they will be able to apply to work elsewhere within the bank.</p><p>Most of the new hires are between the ages of 22 and 26, with the oldest aged 32; the team is 59% male and 41% female. The group will be working to fulfill Citi's strategy of aligning resources with sectors where it sees key growth: digital disruption, technology, health and wellness, sustainability revolution and energy transition.</p><p>\"After considering distinct locations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, it was decided that the new group would be located in Málaga for its recognized capacity to attract and retain talent internationally,\" Citi said in a statement. The office is situated in the center of the city, which is one of the oldest in Spain, having been founded by the Phoenicians around 770 B.C.</p><p>Related: No more New York: People are trying to flee the Empire State for warmer destinations.
