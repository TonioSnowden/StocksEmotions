  "text": "<p><strong>One chart to start:</strong> The seven oil supermajors are on track to return<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2852b800-4a03-4cf6-a47f-65c306a22657\"> a near-record $38bn</a> to shareholders through buyback programmes this year thanks to soaring oil and gas prices. Some critics have suggested that buybacks were diverting capital from investing in fighting climate change.</p> <h2>Carl Icahn points his arrow at the golden arches</h2> <p>Call him an activist or a corporate raider — it doesn't matter to<strong> Carl Icahn</strong>. </p> <p>The octogenarian billionaire maintains that his relentless campaigns against greedy CEOs and their bootlicking boards line shareholders' pockets just as much as they do his own.</p> <p>Icahn, who has compared himself to the conquering <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>, has taken a hiatus from business as usual, however, to pursue a less-profitable cause — one that has appeared to bring out his softer side.</p> <p>He's taking on the $187bn fast-food heavyweight <strong>McDonald's</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4a6bca4-d60e-425a-919e-61015eb3300d\">in a highly unusual board fight</a> aimed at changing the way its suppliers treat pigs.</p> <p>Icahn's typical profit maximisation strategy has taken a back seat to the more modest goal of requiring the burger chain's US pork suppliers to end the practice of keeping pregnant pigs confined in small crates. </p> <p>In 2012, McDonald's promised it would <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2012/05/31/1103959/0/en/McDonald-s-USA-Outlines-10-Year-Plan-for-Ending-Gestation-Stall-Use.html\">stop buying from suppliers</a> that confine swine in cramped quarters. </p> <p>A decade later, Icahn has joined up with the<strong> Humane Society of the United States </strong>in demanding action, nominating <strong>Green Century Capital Management</strong>'s president<strong> Leslie Samuelrich</strong> and <strong>Bon Appétit Management Company</strong>'s strategy chief <strong>Maisie Ganzler</strong> to help carry out his mission on its board.</p> <p>Holding just 200 McDonald's shares (worth roughly $50,000 total), Icahn's potential financial gain from the fight is barely a drop in the trough for a seasoned investor who has accumulated tens of billions of dollars throughout his storied career.</p> <p>McDonald's has also argued that his request would be “impossible” to fulfil now, and that such a change would defy “veterinary science”.</p> <p>But the battle should leave corporate America on edge nonetheless, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c978fc0-dc5a-4dfd-aac2-59b043be1e94\">as Lex writes</a>, as even the most hardcore activist investors push increasingly for change over environmental, social and governance issues. </p> <p>Icahn isn't the first to centre a campaign around morality. First-time activist <strong>Engine No. 1</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebfdf67d-cbce-40a5-bb29-d361377dea7a\">unexpected triumph</a> against <strong>ExxonMobil</strong> last year and a court ruling in favour of climate campaigners challenging Shell, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa9946b9-371b-46ff-b127-05849a1de2da\">set the precedent</a> for a new era in activism. </p> <p>More recently <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, the <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/c1e31c6f-6319-4bfc-bde3-3ace80b46a2b\">largest lender</a> to fossil fuel businesses, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70d783fd-64cd-41dc-9847-9d5dc0c8630c\">has been confronted by</a> environmentalists, nuns, and rival fintech start-ups over climate change risk concerns.</p> <p>These David-versus-Goliath tales have bred hope that the little guy has a fighting chance. But Icahn is no underdog holding a slingshot to the world's largest fast-food chain. </p> <p>“[Alexander the Great] just kept going and going until they killed him . . . I'm a little bit like that,” he told the camera in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1903b8ce-a289-49c7-a605-7051072157b1\"><strong>HBO</strong>'s new biopic on his life</a>. </p> <p>McDonald's chief executive <strong>Chris Kempczinski</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2227dfe1-d6e4-49ad-a580-330ecec73fe3\">told the FT</a> that he runs at least 50 miles a week to offset his twice-daily diet of the company's cuisine, is likely training accordingly.</p> <h2>Shari Redstone stars in a new drama</h2> <p><strong>Shari Redstone</strong>'s rise to the helm of <strong>Paramount </strong>was the stuff of Hollywood: a two-decade long battle for control, in which she <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e6fb1d8-be09-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\">defeated</a> two of the most powerful men in the business — the disgraced <strong>CBS </strong>chief <strong>Les Moonves</strong> and her own father — and enough dysfunctional family drama to inspire the hit show <em>Succession</em>.</p> <p>But Redstone's heroic ascent to the top of her family's empire has been followed up with the sequel she never asked for, as the streaming wars <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/388b0122-1a75-42f6-a89e-add8e3385bc8\">pit her against</a> Silicon Valley's most formidable tech companies.</p> <p>Like many of its Tinseltown studio peers, Paramount (formerly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f77a45bc-bdc9-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\"><strong>ViacomCBS</strong></a>) is on a mission to evolve its movie and television businesses into an online streaming service that can compete with<strong> Netflix</strong>,<strong> Amazon</strong>, and other Big Tech adversaries.</p> <p>But that has proven expensive. Redstone's plans to build out its Paramount Plus streaming platform have in part been bankrolled by its recent endeavours as a Hollywood “arms dealer”, licensing its sought-after content portfolio to its competitors to bring in cash.</p> <p>Paramount has been selling assets to fund its streaming ambitions, including the CBS Studio Center where <em>Seinfeld</em> was shot.</p> <p>But as the industry continues to consolidate, investors aren't convinced that Paramount can stand on its own next to media mega-rivals, and instead think the best move is to sell to a larger rival.</p> <p>In 2014, Shari's father Sumner dismissed his daughter's prospects as the next chief of the family empire, saying he would “not discuss succession . . . you know why? I'm not going to die.”</p> <p>While she may not have seen eye to eye with him on where to steer the family business, the refusal to back down clearly runs in the family.</p> <p>“[Paramount is] greater than the sum of its parts,” she told investors this week. “We can deliver the [return on investment] that you expect and deserve.”</p> <h2>Brookfield opens bidding for Australia's dirtiest utility</h2> <p>A bidding war is afoot in Australia — one that could set a new precedent for what private capital is prepared and able to do to quicken the global energy industry's transition to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d27a2526-07d0-4ed6-895a-269aba65275f\">renewables-dominated grid</a> and generate big returns in the process. </p> <p>Canadian investment behemoth <strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong> and Aussie tech billionaire<strong> Mike Cannon-Brookes</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48cda373-e508-41ed-92c2-7bbfe56dc8ff\">have teamed up</a> on Sunday in an attempt to buy one of Australia's biggest and dirtiest energy generators, <strong>AGL</strong>, for A$5bn.</p> <p>AGL has three ageing coal-fired power stations, some gas and renewable generation, and a huge energy retail business. It's Australia's single biggest emitter, making it a target for climate activists. </p> <p>The market is no fan either, worrying about coal's increasing vulnerability against competition from ultra-cheap and plentiful wind and solar.</p> <p>Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield believe that by taking the publicly traded company private and pumping $20bn into new renewables and storage, they can shut the coal plants early and turn AGL into a profitable zero-emissions utility.</p> <p>From AGL's point of view, the A$5bn bid was probably laughably low, and the board summarily rejected it on Monday. They're convinced management's plan to spin off AGL's coal generation business into a standalone company has hidden value for both resulting groups.</p> <p>But Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes are adamant that AGL's share price has nowhere to go but down, and they're not pulling their punches. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cea30ef-61ee-4bdd-aadc-f66881ab0cfb\">In a joint interview</a> with the FT's James Fernyhough, they were clear that if the board refused to engage, they wouldn't be shy of taking their offer directly to big shareholders.</p> <p>Where the deal goes from now is anyone's guess, but it hasn't got off to the friendliest of starts.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Spac promoter <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7637c771-1020-46ad-8243-b1f86394a180\">has quit</a> as chair of the board at <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong>, the space travel group founded by <strong>Richard Branson</strong>, whose shares have plummeted more than 80 per cent over the past year.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>EY </strong>has elected <strong>Julie Boland</strong> as its US chair and managing partner, succeeding<strong> Kelly Grier</strong>, who is retiring in June. Boland previously served as the group's US-central region vice-chair.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> has named<strong> Kristian Triggle</strong> as a managing director within its financial institutions group for Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. He joins from<strong> RBC Capital Markets</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Joanne Owens </strong>has rejoined<strong> Eversheds Sutherland</strong> as a partner, based in London. She was a principal associate at the firm before moving to <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Have you heard the news?</strong> Libertarian “Cable Cowboy” John Malone <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/cnns-problems-are-bigger-than-jeff-zucker\">is coming for CNN</a>.
