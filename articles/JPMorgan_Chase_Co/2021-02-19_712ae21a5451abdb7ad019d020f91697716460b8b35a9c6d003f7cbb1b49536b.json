  "title": "Streetwise: Tiny Companies' Boom Makes Markets Look Silly",
  "text": "<p>FuelCell isn't alone. Fourteen members of the Russell Microcap index have risen so much that they ended Thursday larger than the smallest S&amp;P stock. One, real-estate broker eXp World Holdings Inc., has a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion, more than double the smallest S&amp;P stock. When the index reset was announced last year, the largest stock in the index had a market capitalization of $840 million.</p><p>Within the Russell 2000 index of small companies, the bottom half of which overlaps with the Microcap measure, an astounding 302 stocks are bigger than at least one S&amp;P 500 member. The largest is Plug Power Inc., up 973% last year and another 48% this year to make the fuel-cell developer big enough to be in the top half of the S&amp;P, worth about the same as State Street Corp. or Kroger Co.</p><p>The size of some of these supposedly teeny-weeny stocks is making a mockery of the microcap indexes and their ETFs. Stunning performance so far this year means few are likely to be upset. The Dow Jones U.S. Micro-Cap Total Stock Market Index, structured differently to the Russell version, is up 18.5% this month alone.</p><p>GameStop Corp. was briefly among the silliness, as hedge funds were caught short by a rush of individual Reddit traders, but fell back. Small and microcap stocks are often neglected by big institutions, but stocks with a popular story -- clean energy, electric vehicles, cannabis, bitcoin -- appeal to individuals, hedge funds and investors following a thematic approach.</p><p>Unfortunately for investors, the leading gainers are clearly part of the broader excess in speculative story stocks. Indeed, many of the stocks leading the charge have been here before, soaring and crashing in prior bouts of speculative excess.</p><p>FuelCell was a big winner in the dot-com bubble, soaring 26-fold from the start of 1999 to its 2000 peak, before crashing 99.998% by the summer of 2019 (Plug Power lost 99.99% from 2000 to its 2013 low). FuelCell quadrupled last year and had doubled this year before leading a broad decline in clean-power stocks on Thursday with a 16.6% fall.</p><p>Fizzy drink company Celsius Holdings Inc., up 10-fold in the past year, is finally close to its 2007 high. Apps firm Digital Turbine Inc. similarly boomed before the global financial crisis, and has risen 11-fold in the past year. Overstock.com Inc. is on its third boom, the prior two having proved unsustainable, while bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain Inc. had a previous life as a bubble biotech in 2007 before changing its name.</p><p>Some of this is wild speculation and should have investors worried about wider signs of froth in the market. But the small stock surge isn't all the madness of crowds.</p><p>The prospects of both economic reopening and more stimulus ought to help smaller companies more. Small companies tend to be more sensitive to the economy and more leveraged, meaning they suffered more in the recession but should rebound faster.</p><p>These developments also help unprofitable companies. The 40% or so of the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies that have no earnings have beaten the profitable stocks. This makes sense as they are more likely to survive the sooner the economy emerges from the pandemic. The overall rise in the market helps too, since smaller companies tend to be less liquid, meaning buyers push up the price more than in larger companies.</p><p>Microcap stocks are even less liquid and score even lower on quality gauges that assess balance-sheet strength and reliability of profits.</p><p>\"The big picture of what's going on with small-caps does seem to make sense,\" says Don San Jose, who runs a small-cap fund for JP Morgan Asset Management and focuses on higher-quality stocks. \"What worries me in this mini-bubble is that it just goes too far too fast.\"</p><p>The biggest of the microcap stocks have far outperformed the rest, with the 100 largest in the Russell Microcap index averaging a gain of 56% this year, after tripling last year.</p><p>But strip out the top 100 and the gains have been roughly in line with what has happened in the early stages of recovery from past recessions. That is to say, brilliant, just not quite so amazing as for the bubble stocks: more than 20% so far this year, against less than 5% for the S&amp;P.</p><p>If the reopening and economic recovery proceed without a hitch, non-bubble, tiny stocks should be able to hold their gains. But most of the story stocks will surely crash back to earth as their bubbles pop. The increasingly badly named small and microcap indexes will feel the pain.</p>",
