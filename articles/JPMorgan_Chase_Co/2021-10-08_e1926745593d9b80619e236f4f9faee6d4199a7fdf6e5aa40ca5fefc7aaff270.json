  "text": "<p>Maneesha Ghiya, Partner, FemHealth Ventures</p><p>Maneesha Ghiya co-founded FemHealth Ventures to fulfill a calling she felt to create a platform for investing in women's health, a calling that stemmed from complications she suffered following an emergency caesarean section she underwent during the delivery of her daughter, who is now a healthy 12-year-old. With FemHealth, which is raising its first fund, she plans to consider a range of medical and digital technologies to treat conditions that affect women only, that predominantly affect women, or that affect women differently than men. Before launching FemHealth last year, she gained healthcare-investment experience at hedge funds Highline Capital and Kingdon Capital. She also previously helped launch ExSight Ventures, an ophthalmology-focused venture firm, and was an analyst with JPMorgan Partners, where she was involved in the firm's investment in Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, which developed a treatment for the blinding eye disease age-related wet macular degeneration. Ms. Ghiya, who grew up in New Jersey, graduated from the dual-degree management and technology program at the University of Pennsylvania. She also has an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.</p><p>Irina Haivas, Partner, Atomico</p><p>Irina Haivas is a partner on the investment team at London-based Atomico. Ms. Haivas, who was trained as a doctor and was a surgical fellow at Harvard Medical School, focuses on investments in enterprise startups, health technology and computational biology companies. She said founders' stories, passion and a vision for the future inspire her. Ms. Haivas is on the board of U.K.-based startups, including healthcare communication platform accuRx and artificial-intelligence drug discovery startup Healx Ltd. Ms. Haivas said she is excited to continue investing in the expanding European startup market. \"The ecosystem has made incredible progress over the past five years, and yet in many ways, it still feels like we're just getting started.\"</p><p>Rebecca Lynn, Co-Founder and General Partner, Canvas Ventures</p><p>One of Rebecca Lynn's early bets as a venture investor, Doximity Inc., soared in its public debut this year and was trading at a market capitalization above $17 billion by mid-September. Ms. Lynn first met Doximity's founder as an investor at Morgenthaler Ventures, the predecessor firm to Canvas Ventures. Ms. Lynn was instrumental in spinning Canvas out of Morgenthaler, rebranding it and raising the new firm's first fund back in 2013, as one of the few women at the time to lead her own venture firm. \"This is a lifetime deal and I want to put my own stamp on it,\" she says. Running the firm has also made it possible to bring the best people to the team, she adds. Doximity is one of several of Ms. Lynn's portfolio companies to go public. Others include Luminar Technologies Inc., maker of sensors for autonomous cars that merged with a special-purpose acquisition company in late 2020. The 2014 IPO of LendingClub, meanwhile, cemented Ms. Lynn's track record in venture capital. Ms. Lynn's recent investments include mortgage software startup Brace Software Inc., payments company Tilled Inc. and veterinarian telehealth platform Airvet Inc.</p><p>Katie Rae, Founding Chief Executive and Managing Partner, The Engine</p><p>Under Katie Rae's leadership, the Engine, a venture fund built by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has raised two funds totaling $507 million and invested in dozens of startups in climate tech, human health, food and agriculture, infrastructure and related sectors since 2017. Climate tech is getting more attention lately from the broader venture market, which is helping reduce the risk for the Engine's companies in the sector, Ms. Rae said. \"When we launched the Engine four years ago, one of the key risks going forward for our climate-tech portfolio was going to be the presence of later-stage capital,\" Ms. Rae said. Ms. Rae serves on the boards of companies, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Form Energy and Lilac Solutions. Improving the diversity of the venture industry has also been important to Ms. Rae. In 2018, she founded Equity Summit, an annual event that connects minority and female fund managers with limited partners. \"It's no longer a taboo topic, the industry is having an open dialogue—LPs and GPs—taking a closer look at the representation of portfolios and how venture can continue to do better,\" Ms. Rae said.</p><p>Deena Shakir, Partner, Lux Capital</p><p>Deena Shakir has been an active investor since joining Lux Capital in late 2019. One theme she is pursuing is family and women's health, an area she says has been underinvested in, but holds great promise because of the need for new technology and the central role women play in making healthcare decisions for their families. Her investments include Maven Clinic Co., a virtual clinic for women's and family health, and Alife Health Inc., which aims to use artificial intelligence to improve the odds of success for people undergoing in vitro fertilization. Another area of focus is mental health, where she sees opportunity for innovations that change the way mental-health care is delivered. Before Lux, Ms. Shakir was a partner with GV, the venture arm of Alphabet Inc. Before entering the technology and investment sectors, she was a Presidential Management Fellow in the State Department under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Ms. Shakir, who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, has a joint bachelor's degree in social studies and Near Eastern languages and civilizations from Harvard University, and a master's degree from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.</p><p>Women to Watch: The Next Generation</p><p>Mercedes Bent, Partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners</p><p>Lightspeed Venture Partners' Mercedes Bent says a turning point in her career came in 2015, when she was appointed head of new ventures at General Assembly Space Inc., a New York-based education company geared toward innovative industries, where she learned \"how to drive impact through being an investor.\" She worked with co-founder Jake Schwartz, whom she describes as an important mentor. In 2018, Ms. Bent started in venture investing when she joined education technology-focused Owl Ventures. A year later, she was hired by Lightspeed as a partner to focus on industries spanning education technology, fintech and consumer. Ms. Bent was an investor in San Francisco-based edtech company Outschool Inc. and Mexico City-based trading platform Flink SAPI de CV, among other startups. Looking ahead, Ms. Bent, who co-leads investments in Latin America, believes Africa will be at the forefront of innovation because \"they are already leading in the adoption of crypto.\" Domestically, her goal is to \"invest in more and more women founders and people of color founders.\" As she juggles between work and initiatives promoting diversity and inclusion, Ms. Bent hopes to continue to cultivate one of her biggest passions: writing.</p><p>Gosia Karas, Investment Director, SoftBank Group International</p><p>Gosia Karas leads the growth investment team for SB Opportunity Fund, a $100 million fund SoftBank Group International launched last year to invest in startups led by Black, Latinx and Native American founders. \"It's an undervalued asset class,\" Dr. Karas said. While the fund is focused on returns, it has also been able to win deals because founders felt aligned with its social-equity mission, Dr. Karas said. Dr. Karas has a doctoral degree in finance from Warsaw School of Economics as well as an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. Her SB Opportunity Fund portfolio company Drift is already in the process of being acquired by Vista Equity Partners at a valuation exceeding $1 billion. Meanwhile, smart mattress maker Eight Sleep Inc., the fund's largest investment, has nearly doubled its valuation since Dr. Karas first backed the company in March. Before SB Opportunity Fund, Dr. Karas invested in companies such as Konfio and Loggi as a founding member of the $5 billion SoftBank Latin America Fund, as well as Upside Foods Inc., formerly known as Memphis Meats, as part of SBGI's Silicon Valley deal team. Dr. Karas also helped spearhead SoftBank's initiative to invest in Miami-based startups. SB Opportunity Fund recently moved its headquarters to Miami.</p><p>Anne Osdoit, Partner, Sofinnova Partners</p><p>Anne Osdoit, a partner with European venture-capital investor Sofinnova Partners, is a member of the firm's MD Start Fund. MD Start is Sofinnova's medical-technology accelerator, where she helps startups get off the ground and often leads them in the early going. She is chief executive of Moon Surgical, which seeks to use robotics and other innovations to assist surgeons, and Gradient Denervation Technologies, which is developing technology to treat pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the vessels leading from the heart to the lungs. Ms. Osdoit, who was born in Paris, initially wanted to become a doctor, but later decided engineering would be her optimal path for pursuing her interest in applying new science and technology to healthcare. She studied engineering at École Polytechnique in Paris and biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Before Sofinnova and MD Start, she spent a decade at medtech company Mauna Kea Technologies SAS, where she was involved in a variety of roles, including ones in clinical and regulatory development and marketing and sales.</p><p>Victoria Sun, Principal, Playground Global</p><p>Victoria Sun is a principal at venture firm Playground Global, where she focuses on investing in technical startups and in markets that are being transformed by emerging data sets. Ms. Sun sourced and led Playground's Series A investment into hydrogen transportation and logistics startup Universal Hydrogen Co. in April. An internship with electronics manufacturing company Flex Ltd. that exposed her to cutting-edge technology helped inspire her to pursue a career in advanced technologies, Ms. Sun said. Before joining Playground, Ms. Sun worked on initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse Group's global technology group in San Francisco. She received her bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>—Compiled by Yuliya Chernova, David Carnevali, Brian Gormley and Marc Vartabedian</p>",
