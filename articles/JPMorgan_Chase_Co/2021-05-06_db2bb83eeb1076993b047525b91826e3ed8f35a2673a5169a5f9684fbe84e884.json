  "title": "Companies Get Creative in Hunt for AI Talent; Businesses are sponsoring AI award programs, holding ‘datathons' and scouting software development contests",
  "text": "<p>\"You've got to be creative about finding people that care about more than just money,\" said Peter Krensky, director, analyst on Gartner Inc .'s business analytics and data science team. Any company can be outbid for top AI talent, he said.</p><p>The average base salary for data scientists is $120,000, but some companies are offering $170,000 or more, according to job site Indeed. For machine-learning engineers, the average base salary is about $150,000.</p><p>Companies are employing traditional means of finding talent, such as recruiters and internship programs, but, he said, that is not enough with today's heated competition. There were 37,000 AI job postings in the first quarter of this year, up more than 45% from the fourth quarter of 2020, according to IT trade group CompTIA , which analyzes employer job posting data.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co . said it is looking for hundreds of AI professionals—data scientists, AI researchers and others—although it declined to be more specific.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase has found that one of the best ways to recruit is to build deep relationships with university computer science and AI programs, according to Apoorv Saxena, global head of AI technology at the bank.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase in 2018 hired Carnegie Mellon University's head of machine learning, Manuela Veloso, as its head of artificial-intelligence research. Among the initiatives she leads is an awards program recognizing university faculty and Ph.D. students. Faculty awards come with financial support that enables university professors to work with their students to research new ways to integrate AI in financial services. Ph.D. awards recognize highly talented postgraduate students for work accomplished.</p><p>The program helps the company come up with new ideas and accelerate AI development for its financial-services business while helping to nurture talented students it may later want to recruit, JPMorgan Chase said. The bank said it has hired several award recipients but declined to say how many.</p><p>Carol Juel, executive vice president and chief information officer at Synchrony Financial, said the store credit-card issuer has increased AI hiring over the past three years, although she didn't provide the number of AI staffers the company is looking to hire this year.</p><p>For the past few years Synchrony has been hosting \"datathons\" at the University of Illinois . Partnering with the school's statistics department, the company provides students with software training and tools as well as coaching to help them think like data scientists. The students—studying computer science, engineering and statistics, among other subjects—are then given a business problem and asked to develop a new AI or analytics application in 36 hours.</p><p>The effort, and additional initiatives the company has at other schools, gives Synchrony access to students and the students a sense of what it is like to work in financial services. Ms. Juel said the company has been able to hire dozens of University of Illinois students.</p><p>\"You have to go to where the talent is,\" she said.</p><p>Businesses are also keeping an eye on other AI contests, such as those held on Kaggle, said Gartner's Mr. Krensky. Kaggle, which is owned by Alphabet Inc .'s Google , operates a machine-learning community where data scientists can work together to solve problems. Kaggle often hosts tech challenges and contests where data scientists can show off their AI and technical abilities.</p><p>Any company can create a Kaggle competition to develop an application or solve a problem and offer a cash prize for the best solution. Companies can then watch how participants work and reach out to those doing impressive work, Mr. Krensky said.</p><p>Another way organizations can recruit AI professionals is by promoting their mission.</p><p>Ajai Sehgal, Mayo Clinic's chief data and analytics officer, said data scientists and software engineers graduating from college today want more than just a job.</p><p>\"They want a job with meaning. And Mayo Clinic is a great place to get a job with meaning.\"</p><p>Write to John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.com</p>",
