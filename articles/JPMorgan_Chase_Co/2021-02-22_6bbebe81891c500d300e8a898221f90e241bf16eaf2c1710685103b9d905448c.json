  "title": "U.S. News: Midwest Job Market Beats Odds --- Midwest cities with diverse economies and less population density fare better in pandemic",
  "text": "<p>Economists said Columbus and other Midwest cities that are faring relatively well benefited from a diverse economy that includes a larger-than-average concentration of white-collar workers who could shift to remote work during the pandemic. They also have less reliance on tourism compared with other large metro areas, relatively low population densities, and their overall Covid-19 caseloads haven't been as severe as some hardest-hit parts of the country.</p><p>\"In the case of this particular crisis, the stars are aligned for these places,\" said Sarah Crane, an economist at Moody's Analytics. \"They basically have low exposure to the most damaged parts of the economy.\"</p><p>Benjamin Gibbs, co-founder and chief executive of Ready Robotics, which makes software that runs robots from multiple manufacturers, moved his startup to Columbus from Baltimore three years ago, despite advice from Bay Area venture capital funds that the company needed to move to the West Coast to thrive.</p><p>\"I would literally pull out a map when they said that to show them the concentration\" of U.S. factories in the Midwest, he said. Being close to customers, combined with the talent pool and affordability of Columbus, were enough to move his 15-person staff in February 2018. Now, the company, which got funding from Columbus-based Drive Capital, has nearly 40 employees and sales have been growing rapidly.</p><p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 6.7% in December 2020, from 3.6% a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. Jobless rates in the four Midwest metros rose about half as much, while the rates climbed more in several coastal cities.</p><p>Columbus and Cincinnati finished last year with a seasonally adjusted 5.1% unemployment rate. The rate was 4.3% in Indianapolis and 4.7% in Minneapolis. The rates were higher in San Francisco, 7.3%, and Boston, 6.9%. The latter two cities had among the lowest unemployment rates among major metro areas at the end of 2019.</p><p>Columbus moved from having a near average unemployment rate in 2019 to having among the nation's lowest rates for major metro areas late last year. The region, with a population of 2.1 million, is home to Ohio State University, a source of young talent and stability during economic downturns and the area's largest single employer. The city is also home to the state Capitol and is a major hub for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the largest private employer, with 18,000 workers.</p><p>Like many places, Columbus's restaurants and hotels were hit hard by the pandemic. But other industries fared better: By December, the professional and business services sector was almost back to its year-ago level, according to Labor Department data.</p><p>Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said the city's overall comeback \"kind of speaks to the diversity of our economy.\"</p><p>Unemployment data for metro areas are based on small sample sizes, limiting their value in tracking changes from one month to the next. However, the unemployment rates in Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis have remained below the national average on a seasonally adjusted basis since March, suggesting a degree of resilience over the course of the pandemic.</p><p>Other Midwest metros, including Kansas City, Mo., Minneapolis and St. Louis, had unemployment rates below the national average at the end of last year, though Minneapolis also had a large decline in the size of its labor force.</p><p>Ohio State University economist Bruce Weinberg said the state government in Ohio introduced economic restrictions that were relatively effective at reducing the spread of the virus without unnecessarily limiting business activity -- something he said was easier because Ohio cities aren't that densely populated.</p><p>Still, he said, the metro area continues to face a long recovery. \"We may be doing better than most,\" Mr. Weinberg said of Columbus. \"But there are a lot of people who are without work, there are a lot of people who have gotten Covid, there are a lot of businesses that are struggling.\"</p>",
