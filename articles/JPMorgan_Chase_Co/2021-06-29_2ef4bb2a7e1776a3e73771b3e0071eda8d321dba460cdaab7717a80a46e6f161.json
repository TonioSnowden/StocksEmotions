  "text": "<p>A judge has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bedb65dd-53c9-4e31-b3d7-c85a40fdb104\">dismissed two antitrust lawsuits</a> against Facebook, one filed by the Federal Trade Commission and another by a coalition of US states. </p> <p>In a bruising opinion, Judge James Boasberg in Washington, DC said the FTC's lawsuit was “legally insufficient” and the federal agency had “failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish” that Facebook had monopoly power over the social networking market.</p> <p>Boasberg deemed the FTC's claim that Facebook has a dominant share of more than 60 per cent of the social networking market “unsupported” and “naked”, saying the agency failed to clarify how it calculated the figure.</p> <p>The judge also dismissed a similar case pursued by a group of 46 states and two other jurisdictions — led by New York attorney-general Letitia James — on the basis that any alleged violations took place too long ago. Boasberg&#xa0;said the FTC had 30 days to file a new complaint.</p> <p>The ruling sent Facebook's share price to record levels and its valuation above $1tn for the first time. The business founded by Mark Zuckerberg joins an exclusive club of companies alongside Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon with a valuation that exceeds $1tn.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Lex</strong> Judge Boasberg's decisions show that competition law, which tends to focus narrowly on direct consumer detriment, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/539f5e99-e3a2-421b-aba3-68556303b904\">poorly adapted</a> to deal with big tech.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Five stories in the news</h2> <p><strong>1. US banks to pay extra $2bn in dividends</strong> Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America yesterday all announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c904432-479c-45b3-84e5-857a06bdadb5\">increases to their quarterly dividends</a> after the Federal Reserve loosened restrictions on payouts to shareholders imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Neel Kashkari </strong>Banks' losses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/760f8a05-d5be-4066-8f3d-802d78c33bce\">were much smaller than expected</a> in the pandemic because governments were so aggressive in providing fiscal support for families and businesses.&#xa0;Absent these fiscal interventions, losses in the banking sector would have been much larger, writes the president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. German finance minister rejects calls to reform fiscal rules</strong> Olaf Scholz has <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/1d6d8876-2b21-4550-ba85-443d5c20919b\">dismissed calls for reform</a> of German and EU fiscal rules, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that they provide enough flexibility to overcome crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p><strong>3.

Negotiators in Paris are this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/562fa83d-1af2-4002-82b8-fded22d2df51\">battling to persuade them</a> to sign up to a global deal on corporate taxation.</p> <p><strong>4. South Africa's top court orders Jacob Zuma to go to jail</strong> South Africa's top court has sentenced former president Jacob Zuma to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80facfe0-7797-4f6d-8752-ccb17828f1e1\">15 months in prison</a> for contempt of court after defying an order to attend an inquiry into allegations of corruption under his presidency. Zuma must turn himself in to police within five days.</p> <p><strong>5.
