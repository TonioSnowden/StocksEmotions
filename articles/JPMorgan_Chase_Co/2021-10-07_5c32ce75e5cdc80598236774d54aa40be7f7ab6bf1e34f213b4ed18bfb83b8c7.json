Despite moves by the government and regulators to stem the divide, the gap is actually widening even further, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239c95cc-d34f-43e9-a61e-faa7954277b6\">this less-than-cheery FT analysis</a>. </p> <p>Among the biggest offenders are banks and law firms.</p> <p>When <strong>Jane Fraser </strong>was appointed as <strong>Citigroup</strong>'s chief executive last year, we said a plexiglass ceiling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f9653c-a0b4-41bc-9bc5-1f0e6a30ce65\">had been shattered</a> on Wall Street. And it was true. She's the first woman to lead a big US bank in an industry where male <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4814a8ca-57a2-43f1-a6da-f126a4254f6d\">‘forever CEOs'</a> are clinging to their crowns.</p> <p>But change at the very top is not everything. According to the FT's analysis, women in the UK were paid 87p for every £1 paid to men in April 2020 — when the government compiled the latest figures. This has worsened since 2019, when the pay gap was 12.8 per cent, and&#xa0; 2018, when the gap was 11.9 per cent.</p> <p>At banks and law firms, which displayed some of the largest pay gaps, much of the imbalance has been attributed to the fact that fewer women occupy senior roles. </p> <p><strong>Richard Gnodde</strong>, head of <strong>Goldman Sachs International</strong> — where the median hourly pay gap has increased from 34.4 per cent in 2019 to 36.8 per cent in 2020 — summarises the arguments that many in the industry make: “This issue remains a critical priority for the firm . . . it is working, but it takes time.”</p> <p>Here's how the median hourly pay gaps at the UK arms of prominent banks have evolved over the years:</p> <p>While banking's culture of perma-CEOs has made it difficult for women to enter the industry's top ranks, disparities at the lower rungs persist too. </p> <p><strong>Lloyds</strong>, where the gap was almost 34 per cent last year, said the difference reflects the fact that it still had “a higher proportion of women in more junior levels and fewer women in more senior roles”. At a bonus level, the gap was about 70 per cent.</p> <p>In the world of Big Law, wage gaps have climbed at elite firms over the years. Women were paid 47.4 per cent less than men per hour on average at <strong>Slaughter and May</strong> compared to 45 per cent in 2018, with <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong> trailing close behind with a 46.4 per cent gap from 39 per cent two years prior.</p> <p>Here's how wage gaps have changed at top UK firms:</p> <p>As an industry-wide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa86e22b-06cd-4890-9423-643f316764e3\">talent war</a> sends pay packages skyrocketing at Magic Circle firms and their US rivals, it remains to be seen whether the “golden handcuff” arrangements are being bestowed upon women as much as they are men. (Catch up on that story in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239c95cc-d34f-43e9-a61e-faa7954277b6\">Wednesday's edition</a>.)</p> <p>It comes at a time when the pandemic has placed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5d01f06-9f7c-4cdc-9fee-225e15b5750b\">disproportionate pressure</a> on women to look after children during lockdowns, with men often the first to return to offices. </p> <p>You can find out your own company's pay gap using the interactive chart at the top of the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239c95cc-d34f-43e9-a61e-faa7954277b6\">report</a>.

While the company insists the project is ongoing, an estate agent based opposite the site says there's been “no activity for as long as I can remember.”&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Country Garden</strong>, a Guangdong-based developer and the largest in China by sales, similarly has a luxury development that is yet to be constructed.</p> <p>Chinese developers, who once flocked to London, were already under regulatory pressure from Beijing to curb excessive leverage and limit their borrowing before Evergrande's problems made the front pages.</p> <p>Now the question is whether half-erected structures could become a more common fixture across London's skyline.</p> <h2>Merck's new CEO prescribed a hefty dose of M&amp;A</h2> <p>When <strong>Rob Davis</strong> took the helm of Merck in April, the pharmaceutical company needed a chief executive with just as much of a nose for M&amp;A as they did for breakthrough medicines.</p> <p>Merck's patent for Keytruda, its golden goose of an immunotherapy treatment that has raised the survival odds of thousands of patients and the company's bottom line, is due to expire in 2028. (And in pharma years, where it takes on average a decade and $2.6bn of investment to make a new drug, that's not actually a very long time.)</p> <p>Last week investors received an initial glimpse of what that dealmaking strategy could look like when Merck agreed to pay $11.5bn for <strong>Acceleron Pharma</strong>, a biotech company that develops protein-based therapies to treat a rare blood pressure disorder and some cancers.</p> <p>Davis said the deal would help to diversify Merck's portfolio and that he was scouring for other targets in preparation for an inevitable decline in sales when the clock runs out on its signature cancer wonder drug. </p> <p>Those targets could include <strong>Mirati Therapeutics</strong>, a clinical-stage biotech company with a market value of $8bn, <strong>Strand Therapeutics</strong>, a developer of mRNA therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy, or potentially the $41bn US biotech group <strong>Biogen</strong>, people briefed on the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9688ef3-42ad-4600-ac19-6b22783922c3\">told DD's James Fontanella-Khan</a>. </p> <p>Some find the latter unlikely, however, doubting that Davis would invite the type of regulatory scrutiny that comes with trying to get a pharma mega-deal over the line.</p> <p>“This is the first step on a journey to continue to build out our pipeline so that we have the ability to grow sustainably well into the next decade . . . we won't be limited by the balance sheet,” he told the FT.</p> <p>He has some catching up to do. Even as Keytruda has transformed the company, bringing in just under a third of its total revenue of $48bn last year, Merck has lagged behind rivals during the pandemic, failing to launch its own Covid-19 vaccine.</p> <p>And while Merck's trials for an antiviral pill poised to reduce the risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19 by approximately 50 per cent are beginning to look promising, the drug still wouldn't have the moneymaking potential to replace Keytruda.</p> <p>Perhaps Davis has some tricks up his sleeve to strengthen the immunity of Merck's balance sheet.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Finsbury Glover Hering </strong>has acquired the Washington-based public affairs firm <strong>The Harbour Group</strong>. Separately, <strong>Craig Oliver</strong>, the former Downing Street director of communications under<strong> David Cameron</strong>, and <strong>Amber Rudd</strong>, the former UK home secretary, have left their senior roles at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e709f723-325d-447c-b1bb-c3b52a6dc697\">troubled PR firm</a> <strong>Teneo </strong>to join <strong>FGH </strong>as its new head of strategic communications and a senior adviser, respectively.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Bobby Tudor </strong>and <strong>Maynard Holt</strong>, two of the founders of the boutique energy investment bank <strong>Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co</strong>, are retiring from the firm, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/moves-tudor-holt-founders-energy-focused-investment-bank-retire-2021-10-05/\">says Reuters</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>RBC Capital Markets</strong> has appointed <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> alum and former<strong> National Australia Bank</strong> chief operating officer <strong>Natalie Vanstone </strong>as a managing director and head of global markets in Australia, based in Sydney.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ashurst</strong> has hired <strong>Wes Strickland</strong> as partner in its projects practice, based in Los Angeles.
