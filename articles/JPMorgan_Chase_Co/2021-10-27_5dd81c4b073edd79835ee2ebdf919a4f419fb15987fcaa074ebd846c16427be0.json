  "text": "<p>    JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said it has already committed $13 billion of the $30 billion in lending and spending it pledged last year for improving racial equity. </p><p>   In a progress report Tuesday, the nation's biggest bank said it had issued $6 billion in loans that kept open affordable housing and rental units across the country, and issued $1 billion in loans to build more. It said another $4 billion went into refinancing 16,000 mortgages for Black and Latino borrowers. </p><p>   The original plan called for $2 billion in new small-business lending and 40,000 home loans in minority communities. The bank didn't specify its progress on those figures, though it reiterated the targets. </p><p>   To make those loans, it said it added branches to minority neighborhoods, created new jobs and is developing new loan products. </p><p>   The bank also said it made investments in minority-owned lenders, increased spending with minority-owned suppliers and boosted philanthropy. </p><p></p>",
