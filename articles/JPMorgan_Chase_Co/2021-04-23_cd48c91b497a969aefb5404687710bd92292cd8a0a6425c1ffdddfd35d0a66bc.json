  "text": "<p>   SYDNEY -- The Australian parent of Greensill was placed into liquidation following a meeting of creditors owed nearly $1.33 billion when the supply-chain finance business became insolvent last month. </p><p>   The move to liquidate Greensill Capital Pty Ltd. was unopposed by the 23 creditors that joined a virtual meeting in Australia that ran for more than 90 minutes on Thursday. Three creditors abstained from the vote. </p><p>   No buyers emerged for Greensill Capital, the parent company of more than 40 businesses, after it was declared insolvent, according to a creditor who attended the meeting. Separate insolvency proceedings for Greensill's main operating unit, which is based in the U.K., and its banking unit are continuing. </p><p>   Greensill Capital's secured creditors include Credit Suisse Group AG and the Greensill family business, while Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. is among unsecured creditors. The creditors' meeting was also attended by representatives of the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and the Association of German Banks. </p><p>   A U.S.-based spokesman for Greensill declined to comment. </p><p>   Founded by Australian-born Lex Greensill, the company billed itself as a technology startup that competed with traditional banks such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Greensill's goal was to offer supply-chain finance to companies that had fallen below the radar of traditional banks that preferred larger, more-established clientele. </p><p>   It became mired in crisis last month when Credit Suisse froze $10 billion in investment funds that Greensill relied upon to fuel much of its business. </p><p>   According to a report by Grant Thornton, the insolvency experts handed control of Greensill on March 8, creditors have lodged claims for nearly $1.33 billion, or 1.72 billion Australian dollars. The largest claim by SoftBank is for roughly $1.16 billion. </p><p>   In addition, the Association of German Banks has made a contingent claim for 2 billion euros, or $2.41 billion, to cover potential losses if Bremen-based Greensill Bank's customers call on a fund that protects their deposits. </p><p>   Insolvency specialists are continuing to see if any of Greensill's assets can be sold to raise money for creditors. Last month, a small financial-technology business called Earnd was sold to London-based Wagestream. The sale of another Greensill-owned company, digital lender Omni Technologies, is also being considered by Grant Thornton. </p><p>   \"At present it is too early to determine whether there will be any return available from the UK Administrations,\" said Grant Thornton. </p><p></p>",
