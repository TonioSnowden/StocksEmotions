That has left tens of billions of dollars worth of takeover debt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3989312e-489b-4cb8-86bf-55b078d96dc9#comments-anchor\">stuck on banks' balance sheets</a>, the FT's Eric Platt and DD's Antoine Gara report.</p> <p>The hangover has ground the bank financing market to a halt. </p> <p>“The traditional bank-financing and high-yield markets are effectively shut at the moment,” Kewsong Lee, chief executive of <strong>Carlyle</strong> <strong>Group</strong>, told the FT.</p> <p>JPMorgan chief executive <strong>Jamie</strong> <strong>Dimon</strong> estimated in July that banks are on the hook for less than $100bn of financing packages, roughly a fifth of the level seen in 2007 on the precipice of the financial crisis.</p> <p>It's a scenario leveraged finance bankers could've hardly imagined just a few months ago, as they finalised debt packages for private equity megadeals including a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/277ba6fa-9a77-4475-91df-e46699081922\">$14bn buyout</a> of <strong>McAfee </strong>and a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24519628-9c86-4b6e-b38c-e03142afa3ee\">$17bn takeover</a> of<strong> Athenahealth</strong>. (Not to mention a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af8f7459-2152-42da-956a-cc322651ed9d\">$44bn surprise</a> from <strong>Elon Musk</strong> that was just around the corner.)</p> <p>A nightmare has played out instead. </p> <p>A group of lenders, including Goldman, BofA and <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Suisse</strong>, financing <strong>Vista</strong> <strong>Equity</strong> and <strong>Elliott Management</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfb26bb-878c-4cd5-9c62-9d2a9ac94b8c\">$16.5bn takeover</a> of software company <strong>Citrix</strong> could lose $1bn or more on the deal, according to people involved in the transaction.</p> <p>The Citrix deal, as well as a $5.4bn financing package for <strong>Apollo</strong>'s takeover of automotive supplier <strong>Tenneco</strong>, was postponed until after Labor Day.</p> <p>Lenders are hoping to avoid the fate of a Goldman-led group's financing of<strong> Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fb5f5d7-a397-4300-b0f3-90387ddb292a\">£10bn takeover</a> of UK grocer <strong>Wm</strong> <strong>Morrison</strong>. The deal led to £200mn in gross losses, the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b22a85ae-3d44-499c-a603-250ecb1158ef\">reported last week</a>. Catch up on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d00139f4-c4c7-4808-91cd-77daf5ac7481\">DD</a> take, if you missed it.</p> <p>Bankers have been sidelined as their bloated balance sheets make it difficult to assemble new financings, leaving private equity dealmakers to turn to direct lenders instead. </p> <p><strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman </strong>and<strong> Permira</strong>'s <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202206240841BIZWIRE_USPRX____20220624_BW5233-1\">$10.2bn takeover</a> of software firm <strong>Zendesk</strong> <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202206240841BIZWIRE_USPRX____20220624_BW5233-1\">is being financed</a> with over $4bn in private debt raised by a consortium of non-bank lenders led by <strong>Blackstone</strong> <strong>Credit</strong>.</p> <p>Those involved in the deal say it would be hard to replicate such a large financing now as souring markets cause direct lenders to trim exposures and become more selective. </p> <p>“People are still launching new processes,” said one person. “I'm not exactly sure why, to be honest with you.”</p> <p>Senior dealmakers, meanwhile, have little sympathy for the banks. As one noted to DD, buyouts generated strong underwriting fees for a decade. Everyone has to eat a deal every once in a while.</p> <h1>Inside the clash at one of the Gulf's most powerful funds</h1> <p>It's a bit of a mess inside the <strong>Kuwait Investment Authority </strong>at the moment. </p> <p>For decades, the emirate's $700bn-plus sovereign wealth fund garnered a reputation as a powerful and respected investor, while keeping a low profile. </p> <p>Then, the KIA <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d48d0a44-8fee-4e34-bcfc-66edfdc85b12\">abruptly sacked</a> <strong>Saleh al-Ateeqi</strong>, the head of its London investment arm, the Kuwait Investment Office, dragging it into the spotlight.</p> <p>Founded in 1953, the KIA is the guardian of Kuwait's wealth for a post-oil future. But the departure of Ateeqi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2d7b536-c4c6-49ee-9a2c-63d6a81cff0f\">has exposed the rising tensions</a> within the fund between those who want to modernise, and an entrenched old guard opposed to change, the FT reports.</p> <p>It has not explained its decision to fire Ateeqi, which capped a four-year period in which the KIO became embroiled in a string of legal battles with former staff, internal investigations and rising tensions between the London office and leadership in Kuwait. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10765037.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Ateeqi's backers said his firing was politically motivated, blaming a power struggle between those attempting to reform the fund and an old guard at the KIA. Ateeqi is now suing Kuwait's finance minister and the managing director of the KIA who fired him. &#xa0;</p> <p>With various factions pitted against each other, one fund manager who invests on behalf of the KIA told the FT: “It's chaos there now.”</p> <h2>The venture party goes kaput</h2> <p>The lure of astronomical returns led Silicon Valley outsiders to embrace venture capital.</p> <p>But plummeting valuations have now left many with regrets. Not that they're keen to admit it.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10766489.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Venture capital <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6395df7e-1bab-4ea1-a7ea-afaa71354fa0\">is on a crash course with reality</a>, the FT's Richard Waters writes in an FT Big Read, as “crossover” investors who've shifted billions from public markets into the VC world reassess their bets.</p> <p>With no daily market indices to shed light on how bad it really is, investors and entrepreneurs feeling the pain have been allowed to do so in relative privacy.</p> <p>It's mostly when companies try to raise cash that they have to face reality, often in the public eye. </p> <p>Nearly half a trillion dollars <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/338eda46-04e5-46b3-a71d-a429d21c490c\">has been wiped</a> from the valuation of once high-flying fintechs since the start of 2020. Swedish buy now, pay later group <strong>Klarna</strong> sent shockwaves through the industry when it raised money at a $5.7bn valuation — 87 per cent less than its venture capital backers judged it was worth a year ago.</p> <p>How is the industry responding? “We're probably somewhere between anger and bargaining,” in the five stages of grief, says Josh Wolfe, co-founder of <strong>Lux Capital.</strong> </p> <p>Perhaps the most optimistic take, in a world dominated by optimists, is that the crunch will leave good start-ups — with real products and some financial discipline — with less competition as the excesses fade away.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Arm</strong>, the UK semiconductor designer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3913492f-ce8c-4df9-9d7f-7156daea326e\">backed by <strong>SoftBank</strong></a>, has appointed SoftBank Investment Advisers' general counsel <strong>Spencer Collins</strong> as chief legal officer. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Instagram</strong> head <strong>Adam Mosseri</strong> <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/5f240367-b199-425b-adc3-0526744e3677\">is moving to London</a>, signalling a strategic shift for the social networking app that is in a fierce battle with viral video platform<strong> TikTok </strong>to attract and retain younger audiences.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has appointed senior <strong>UBS</strong> M&amp;A banker <strong>Adrian Beidas</strong> as co-head of its UK advisory business.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> credit trader <strong>Matthew Mezger</strong> has left the lender after 16 years to join cryptocurrency trading firm <strong>Digital Currency Group</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> has appointed former <strong>Standard Life </strong>chief financial officer <strong>Jackie Hunt</strong> as an independent non-executive director.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Centerview Partners</strong> dealmakers<strong> David Handler</strong> and<strong> David Neequaye</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/centerview-bankers-depart-to-form-tech-focused-deal-advisory-boutique-tidal-partners-11659384659\">are leaving</a> to launch a boutique M&amp;A advisory firm, per The Wall Street Journal.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Skadden </strong>has hired <strong>Allen &amp; Overy </strong>partner <strong>Kate Davies</strong> to join its disputes and arbitration practice in London.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Goodwin</strong> has hired <strong>Winfried Carli</strong>, a leveraged finance partner from rival <strong>Shearman &amp; Sterling</strong>, to join its private equity practice in Munich.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Money trail</strong> “Don't eff this up rafiq,” private equity tycoon Arif Naqvi wrote in an email. Pakistan forbids foreign nationals and companies from funding political parties, but these groups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de29dd83-8fa9-40a2-aff6-5996f1557d0d\">sent millions</a> to a company owned by Naqvi which passed money on to Imran Khan's party, writes Simon Clark for the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>A handout for billionaires</strong> Private equity lobbyists' attempts to justify the carried interest tax break <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51000eb2-3b3b-4ced-8019-d33a3957070d\">are mostly baloney</a>. If abolishing the perk meant breaking Wall Street's spell over Washington, it would be welcome, writes the FT's Mark Vandevelde.</p> <p><strong>Perks of the job </strong>Elite law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis's backing of its private equity clients extends beyond advice.
