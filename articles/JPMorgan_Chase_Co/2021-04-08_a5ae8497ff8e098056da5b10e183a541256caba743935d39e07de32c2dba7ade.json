  "title": "Asos receives Covid-19 boost to sales but is ‘mindful' of coming months",
  "text": "<p>Asos posted a near threefold jump in half-year profit while sounding a cautious note on sales once pandemic restrictions ease and clothes shops reopen.</p> <p>Pre-tax profit in the six months to the end of February was £106m, up from £30.5m last year. The fashion retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd653e6a-dbd1-46a6-b44b-4d819a552e9f\">flagged “exceptional” sales growth</a> of 39 per cent in the UK along with £48.5m of benefits from Covid-19, mostly in the form of lower return rates.</p> <p>The company said it remained “mindful” of uncertainty and “the likely economic impact” on its consumers, as well as cautioning that freight costs were running at much higher levels than normal. “In the coming months we expect a portion of consumer demand will move back to stores as restrictions are eased throughout our markets, but we expect online penetration to remain structurally higher than pre Covid-19 levels,” it said. </p> <p>It also expected the benefits of lower returns to gradually unwind as restrictions on socialising were removed, because clothes bought for special occasions typically have higher return rates than casual wear.</p> <p>“As a result, our expectations for the full year have increased in line with our outperformance in the first half, and our outlook for the second half is unchanged,” Asos concluded.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> revealed plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ce6763a-d1c7-4906-ac1b-b04fc9e7dc97\">demerge its South African thermal coal operations</a> by June, subject to shareholder approval. The separation will be implemented by transferring the assets to a NEW holding company, Thungela Resources, which will have its primary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with a standard listing in London. Thungela's entire share capital will be held by&#xa0;Anglo&#xa0;shareholders who will each receive one Thungela share for every ten&#xa0;Anglo&#xa0;shares that they hold, Anglo said.</p> <p><strong>Ferrexpo</strong>, the iron ore producer, said upgrade work at its production lines meant pellet production was down 10 per cent year on year in the first quarter.</p> <p>Homewares retailer <strong>Dunelm</strong> said it expects to end the fiscal year “modestly ahead of the top of the current range of analyst expectations”. The company's third-quarter update to the end of March&#xa0;showed revenue down 16.8 per cent to £236.6m, with digital sales making up 92 per cent of the total compared with less than 23 per cent the year before. </p> <p>Alternative asset manager <strong>Sanne</strong> said it has raised £79.5m before expenses with an overnight share placing at 640p apiece, a 4.2 per cent discount to Wednesday's closing price. The equity issue followed Sanne announcing after Wednesday's close that it had agreed to buy Strait Capital,&#xa0;a private equity and hedge fund administration business headquartered in Dallas. It will pay an upfront consideration of $32m, of which around 30 per cent will be payable in Sanne shares, plus a maximum earn-out of $13m.</p> <p><strong>Draper Esprit</strong>, the technology-focused venture capital group, said it has invested a total of £162m in the year ended March. Realisations for the year raised over £200m and included the flotation of consumer review site Trustpilot and the sale of Decibel, a machine learning software maker.</p> <p><strong>Winkworth</strong>, the estate agent franchise operator, said pre-tax profit last year fell 6.1 per cent to £1.5m on flat revenue of £6.4m. “In the first quarter we have seen a strong uptick in sales agreed and a very encouraging increase in applications for both sales and rentals,” the company said.</p> <p>Conference organiser <strong>Hyve</strong> said revenue for the first half ended March is expected to be approximately £10m after Groceryshop Spring Meetup, the first event held by the Retail Meetup business it bought in December, performed more than 10 per cent ahead of expectations. Hyve also announced the disposal of its Kazakhstan business for between&#xa0;£4.8m and £5.8m, payable over seven years, to a vehicle owned by a former company consultant in the region.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>BlackRock's</strong> chief executive Larry Fink said the asset manager was aiming to “reset behavioural expectations” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a00b465-374e-4eb9-921f-726ab5d33bc1\">across the company</a> as it deals with a series of allegations about discrimination and sexual harassment.
