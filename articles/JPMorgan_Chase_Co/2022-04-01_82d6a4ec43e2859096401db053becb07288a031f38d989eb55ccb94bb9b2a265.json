  "title": "Film Financier Slams Studio for Placing Movie Deals in Bankruptcy; 30WEST says STX Entertainment orchestrated chapter 11 to avoid paying for the rights to action flick ‘The Contractor'",
  "text": "<p>STX assigned the distribution rights to a newly formed subsidiary last month, then filed it for chapter 11 after the company failed to make $8.4 million in contract payments to 30WEST, according to the financier's court filing. The bankruptcy filing automatically prohibited 30WEST from terminating the defaulted deal with STX, part of Eros STX Global Corp.</p><p>Now, STX is able to release \"The Contractor\" without paying for the right to do so, according to 30WEST, which said it wants to end the contract and reclaim the film.</p><p>Representatives for STX and its parent company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Eros STX said last week that it had put its rights to \"The Contractor\" in chapter 11 to protect the value of that asset while working to close a sale of the STX business worth $157 million, including debt.</p><p>Delays in closing that proposed sale to private-investment firm Najafi Co., announced in December, have jeopardized STX's distribution rights to both \"The Contractor\" and a forthcoming sequel to 2020 disaster thriller \"Greenland.\" In February, the company transferred the rights for the \"Greenland\" sequel to an affiliate, then placed it in chapter 11 to protect the distribution deal from possible termination.</p><p>That bankruptcy came after STX missed a contractual deadline to refinance $150 million in debt held by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., company lawyer Chad Husnick said in bankruptcy court last month.</p><p>Mr. Husnick said last month that chapter 11 would provide a breathing spell from creditor action \"while STX and its other affiliates work to complete a value-maximizing strategic transaction.\"</p><p>The chapter 11 cases of the two STX subsidiaries—FSO Jones LLC and Migration Productions I LA LLC—are being administered jointly.</p><p>30WEST said that STX's assignment of its rights to \"The Contractor\" to a newly formed affiliate is a \"textbook bad faith filing,\" meant to frustrate the rights of its contract counterparty while still enjoying the benefits of their deal. STX has enlisted entertainment companies to distribute \"The Contractor\" through \"various media forms, including theatrical, television, home video and digital/internet streaming in return for payments,\" according to the creditor's filing.</p><p>30WEST said that if STX needs protection because it is in financial distress, then it should file for chapter 11 itself and subject all its creditors to bankruptcy.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at andrew.scurria@wsj.com</p>",
