  "title": "Arbitrator Rules Against Solar Developer's Backers; 8minute Power seeks to use a preliminary decision over a $325 million investment to sway a lawsuit brought against it by the University of California system",
  "text": "<p>The decision became public when it was submitted to Alameda County Superior Court in Alameda, Calif., where the company and Dr. Buttgenbach face $1.22 billion in claims from a lawsuit that the Oakland, Calif.-based University of California system filed in December over money it invested in several solar projects through Upper Bay. 8minute has asked the court to compel the university system to submit its claims to the same arbitration.</p><p>The UC system invested $150 million through a separately managed account run by Upper Bay. The system is suing 8minute seeking compensation for triple the $405 million it said it didn't get as reasonable expected returns from its investment in the venture.</p><p>The arbitration, started by Upper Bay and JPMorgan, revolves around a joint venture called 8minutenergy US Solar LLC. JPMorgan invested $135 million in the venture and Upper Bay committed $40 million, according to the arbitrator, who said that $50 million of the original investment was returned. The company contributed roughly 50 solar projects it had in development or planned to develop.</p><p>The venture was expected to earn development fees on the company's solar projects after they were sold. Dr. Buttgenbach, however, delayed the sale of some of the projects, according to the UC lawsuit, which alleged that he engineered a financial crisis to create a deadlock among his backers that would enable him to seize the investors' interests in the projects.</p><p>The private-equity investors had claimed that 8minute and Dr. Buttgenbach engaged in self-dealing, sought more than $4 billion in additional financing and breached budgetary and governance stipulations of the joint venture, allegations similar to those made by the UC system in its lawsuit.</p><p>8minute Power said it \"is pleased the arbitrator has denied the baseless claims against us and Dr. Buttgenbach in their entirety.\" Dr. Buttgenbach has a Ph.D. in physics and astronomy. The company submitted the preliminary decision to the Alameda court to support its request to compel arbitration over the claims.</p><p>Upper Bay disputed the arbitrator's ruling.</p><p>\"We respectfully disagree with the arbitrator's decision and intend to challenge it for several reasons at the appropriate time,\" the firm said.</p><p>A UC system spokesman said it \"will oppose the petition to compel arbitration and argue its claims are appropriately heard before the California superior court.\"</p><p>JPMorgan declined to comment.</p><p>Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com</p>",
