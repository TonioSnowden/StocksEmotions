The Japanese group invested in Greensill and also poured money into <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> funds linked to it, which in turn made bets on <strong>Vision Fund</strong> companies.</p></li>  <li><p>Greensill responded that the conflicts could be managed, but Baldwin said it didn't pass the “smell test”.</p></li>  <li><p>Labour's <strong>Angela Eagle</strong> cited the FT's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe234f59-75b9-44f7-af8a-f05e588957b7\"> coverage</a> of Greensill's loans to <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>'s company on the basis of invoices that have raised suspicions of fraud: “At no point would we or my firm have engaged in financing receivables which we knew to be fraudulent,” Greensill said.</p></li>  <li><p>In response to more of Eagle's questions, Greensill said Cameron was on the payroll at Greensill as an employee and had a “standing invitation” to board meetings. He confirmed they had travelled on the company's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3cf4459-dd54-49c1-a777-276f8ae0d406\">private jet</a> together.</p></li>  <li><p>Greensill said he hadn't heard of “prospective receivables” and he read about it in the FT. However, a lawsuit against his company from <strong>Bluestone Resources</strong> said the term was used in its written agreement with Greensill in 2018. And Sanjeev Gupta wrote to the FT using the phrase to describe his companies' financing arrangements with Greensill.</p></li>  <li><p>Greensill declined to answer questions from Labour MP <strong>Emma Hardy</strong> about whether the FCA investigated his company in 2018 when it looked into issues linked to the Swiss asset manager <strong>GAM</strong>, which invested heavily in Greensill products and was forced to liquidate funds. He said he was not sure whether he was allowed to discuss the matter.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <p>Oh, and there's one more detail we couldn't leave out. In a message to the Treasury's Scholar in March 2020, as the world battled an escalating pandemic, Cameron described his new role like this:</p> <p>“I am riding to the rescue with supply chain finance with my friend Lex Greensill — my new job,” he wrote, promising an “elbow bump” soon.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Signed: “Love Dc”</p> <h2>Cathie's Ark sets sail for frothy markets</h2> <p>Before last year <strong>Cathie Wood </strong>was probably best known for being a <strong>Tesla</strong> bull.</p> <p>Wood, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4df2b4cf-2ffe-4db5-9594-47e05e1e2240\">devout Christian</a> who named her asset manager <strong>Ark Invest</strong> after the gold-covered chest described in the Book of Exodus, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7oPJZG_boA\">predicted in 2018</a> that shares in <strong>Elon Musk</strong>'s electric car company would soar to $4,000 by 2023.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Tesla is the biggest holding in Wood's largest exchange-traded fund, the actively managed “Ark Innovation”. Her faith in the company paid off last year, as shares in Tesla rose 700 per cent.</p> <p>The success of Tesla and other technology stocks Ark owns during the pandemic have catapulted Wood to fame and made her the face of a speculative tech boom that has been compared to the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the combined value of the five ETFs Wood manages soaring as high as $60bn, from just $3bn a year ago, it has become difficult to ignore her presence in market discourse.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the key figures behind some of those funds is a familiar face to DD readers, <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong> founder<strong> Bill Hwang</strong>. The embattled investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a19a04c2-02e5-4ac5-a66e-0951e004b37f\">helped</a> Wood get her start in 2014 when he provided the seed for her first four ETFs.</p> <p>Hwang and Wood have a lot in common: they're both devoted to a higher power, they like to make bold bets and they have an appetite for risk.</p> <p>Ark, which is famous for its concentrated bets, is now seeing some of those risky investments begin to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7eca62e9-67f0-4241-bf6e-8b9ae0404351\">fall out of favour</a> amid a broader pullback from tech stocks.</p> <p>Wood's flagship $21bn Ark Innovation fund has fallen to its lowest level since November after surging almost 150 per cent last year, with some of its biggest holdings down a tenth or more already this month.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has now lost over one-third of its value since a February peak, as its heavily weighted tech holdings, including <strong>Tesla</strong>, <strong>Teladoc</strong>,<strong> Roku </strong>and <strong>Square</strong> have tumbled in recent weeks.</p> <p>Ark's bullish investment strategy has charged ahead despite these losses, selling big-name tech positions like <strong>Apple </strong>while doubling down on smaller companies, regardless of their performance.</p> <p>One example is the commercial electric vehicle company <strong>Workhorse</strong> <strong>Group</strong>, whose lacklustre first-quarter earnings on Monday were further bruised after losing out on a $6bn deal with the <strong>US Postal Service</strong> to rival vehicle maker<strong> Oshkosh</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet, Ark has continued to increase its stake in the group.</p> <p>For Wood, it's no big deal. “I love the set-up” she told CNBC last week, assured that her big bets would pay off in time.&#xa0;</p> <p>For more on Ark, Alphaville's Jamie Powell offers his takes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92e4217d-faa8-45d0-881d-68eeab96021c\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a3aa91c-4d1f-4005-80a4-fc8ae6e2544c\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Amazon versus Walmart: clash of the retail titans</h2> <p>The world's most feared retailers, <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Walmart</strong>, have sunk billions into their respective ecommerce arsenals.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the battle has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ab41b9e-a294-430f-951d-49cfc3415460\">entered new turf</a> — somewhere Amazon has worked since its inception to disrupt — as “the everything store” encroaches on the one territory where Walmart has always managed to beat Jeff Bezos: brick-and-mortar storefronts.</p> <p>The first Amazon Fresh supermarket, which opened last September in Los Angeles, is a symbol of the online retail group's ambitions to gain a real foothold in the $1.3tn grocery market (without forgetting that Amazon acquired high-end <strong>Whole Foods</strong> for $13.4bn in 2017).&#xa0;</p> <p>It's also a swift retaliation against its largest competitor, as Walmart invests record sums into building its online presence.</p> <p>This being said, Walmart is still very much a digital underdog. Amazon retains 40 per cent of the US ecommerce market, next to its own 7 per cent.</p> <p>In other words, the battle for its grocery aisles is one Walmart can't afford to lose.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Glenn Youngkin</strong>, former co-chief executive of the <strong>Carlyle Group</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-republican-nominee-governor-convention/2021/05/10/c31a9bbe-ae8b-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html\">has won</a> the Republican nomination for Virginia governor.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>J David Enriquez</strong>, head of private equity at the $251bn<strong> New York City Retirement Systems</strong>, has left the pension fund to join <strong>Rothschild &amp; Co</strong>'s US private equity division, <strong>Five Arrows Capital Partners</strong>, as a member of its multi-strategies team.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> has hired <strong>Richard Robinson</strong> as a managing director and vice-chair of global industrials. He joins in New York after serving as co-head of basic materials investment banking for the Americas at <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Clifford Chance</strong> has hired a trio of private equity lawyers from <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> in Munich. The hires include <strong>Volkmar Bruckner</strong> and <strong>Mark Aschenbrenner</strong> at the partner level.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> has hired <strong>Gregory Scott</strong>, a private equity senior associate at <strong>Clifford Chance</strong>, as a partner in its London office, according to<a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/kirkland-ellis-poaches-clifford-chance-private-equity-star-20210510\"> Financial News</a>. The firm also added <strong>Stanley Ramsay</strong> as a tax partner. He joins the New York office from <strong>Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Burnt bridges </strong>Without Greensill's golden credit card, Sanjeev Gupta's steel empire may be hurling towards a collapse of its own.
