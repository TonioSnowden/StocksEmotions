It was originally intended to be a classification yard, a site where railcars are sorted by destination and assembled into trains. Instead, Union Pacific will now use the site for block-swapping activities. </p><p>\n  Block swapping involves transferring a linked set of railcars between trains without sorting individual cars. Completing the Brazos project as a classification yard would have required additional investment, Union Pacific said on Friday. </p><p>\n  The company added that newly created capacity at existing facilities will be enough to handle Union Pacific's planned southern-region growth without using the Brazos site as a classification yard. </p><p>\n  Union Pacific also provided preliminary results for its fourth quarter. It said it expects to report operating revenue of roughly $5.1 billion, operating expenses of roughly $3.1 billion and operating income of about $2 billion. </p><p>\n  -- Matt Grossman </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BED BATH &amp; BEYOND </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Retailer Speeds Up </p><p>\n  Stock-Buyback Pact </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. said it signed an additional $150 million accelerated share-repurchase agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank as part of the retailer's $825 million stock-buyback program. </p><p>\n  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which currently has about 121.2 million shares outstanding, said it expects to receive about 5 million shares under the accelerated repurchase. </p><p>\n  The Union, N.J., company said on Friday that $450 million will remain available for stock buybacks after the accelerated repurchase. </p><p>\n  Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond rose 1% on Friday to $18.94. </p><p>\n  -- Colin Kellaher </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BOOT BARN </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Growth at Stores </p><p>\n  Boosts Holiday Sales </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Boot Barn Holdings Inc. reported better-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter, boosted by growth at its retail locations. </p><p>\n  The western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories retailer reported preliminary sales of $302.3 million for the third quarter ended Dec. 26, a 6.5% increase over the year-earlier period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $297.2 million. </p><p>\n  Boot Barn said comparable sales at its retail locations returned to positive growth, rising 1.9%, while e-commerce grew 16%. The company said it benefited from disciplined promotional activity and strong sales at full price. Total same-store sales are expected to increase 4.6%, the company said. </p><p>\n  -- Kimberly Chin </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  SIERRA METALS </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Mining Company </p><p>\n  Weighs Sale, Merger </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Sierra Metals Inc. said on Friday that it is considering strategic alternatives including a sale of the company, an asset sale or a merger. </p><p>\n  The Canadian mining company said the strategic review has the support of the funds that are the company's two largest shareholders. </p><p>\n  Sierra said it has brought in CIBC World Markets Inc. to assist in the process. The company closed Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a market cap of roughly US$540 million. </p><p>\n  -- Matt Grossman </p><p></p>",
