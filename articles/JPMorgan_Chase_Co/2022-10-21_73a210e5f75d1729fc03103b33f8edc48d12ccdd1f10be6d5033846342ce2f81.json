  "text": "<p>Major U.S. stock indexes ended the week with gains of more than 4.7%, and all three have notched gains for October.</p><p>The week has been marked by big swings for stocks and bonds around the globe.</p><p>Major indexes turned higher Friday and Treasury yields paused their climb as The Wall Street Journal reported that Federal Reserve officials are set to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point at their Nov. 1-2 meeting but are poised to debate shifting to a smaller increase in December.</p><p>\"I think we're in the final innings of peak Fed hawkishness,\" said Christian Hoffman, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management overseeing bonds.</p><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury notes slipped Friday but climbed for a 12th consecutive week and notched its largest gains over such a stretch since 1987. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury ended the week at 4.212%, near its highest levels of the past decade. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is typically more sensitive to interest rate expectations, also slipped Friday and ended the week at 4.489%.</p><p>U.K. assets also recorded large swings after U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned.</p><p>Investors have been closely watching earnings for clues on how rising rates, a strong dollar and high inflation are affecting company profits.

U.S. banks helped boost markets earlier this week with better-than-expected results, but cracks are showing elsewhere.</p><p>So far, the net profit margin of S&amp;P 500 companies in the third quarter is set to decrease for the fifth consecutive period.</p><p>Still, the week has been dotted by several signs that the U.S. economy is stronger than many initially feared.

And fresh data on Thursday showed that the jobs market is strong.</p><p>Snap shares tumbled 28% after the company reported a further slowdown in sales growth and signaled the digital-ad market could remain lackluster for some time.</p><p>\"The reality is that we see weak growth, higher inflation, and earnings surprising to the downside. It's a pretty difficult combination,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \"This earnings season is going to still be OK. The worry is for the next two, in a way.\"</p><p>Twitter slid 4.9%after Bloomberg News reported that Biden administration officials are discussing whether the U.S. should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national-security reviews.</p><p>In the U.K., markets came under pressure Friday as investors questioned who will win the race to become the country's next prime minister after the resignation of Liz Truss on Thursday.</p><p>The British pound rose slightly to $1.13 and the U.K. 10-year gilt yield rose to about 4.04% from 3.860% Thursday.
