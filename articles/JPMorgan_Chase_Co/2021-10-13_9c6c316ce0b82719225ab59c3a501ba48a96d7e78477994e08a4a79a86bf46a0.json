  "title": "JPMorgan Chase profit grows with boost from $2.1 billion reserve release",
  "text": "<p>The bank notched gains in its auto lending and investment banking businesses, but reported a drop in loan activity.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase JPM earned $11.69 billion, or $3.74 a share, up from $9.44 billion, or $2.92 a share, in the year-ago period. The latest result included $2.1 billion, or 52 cents a share, in credit reserve releases.</p><p>Reported net revenue increased to $29.65 billion from $29.26 billion, while managed net revenue increased to $30.44 billion from $29.94 billion. Net interest income increased 1% to $13.2 billion.</p><p>Analysts expected the bank to earn $3.00 a share on revenue of $29.79 billion, with net interest income of $13.1 billion, according to a FactSet survey.</p><p>Shares of JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% in premarket trading. They had rallied 30.1% this year through Tuesday, compared with a rise of 15.8% by the S&amp;P 500 SPX.</p><p>Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said the results were “strong” as the economy continues to show good growth, despite the dampening effect of the delta variant and supply chain disruptions. The bank continues to focus on strategic, add-on acquisitions, he said.</p><p>The company expects 2021 net interest income of about $52.5 billion, compared with an analyst projection of $52.3 billion.</p><p>Breaking down third-quarter results, average loans increased by 5%; average deposits were up 19%.</p><p>Commercial banking revenue rose 10.3% to $2.52 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate of$2.12 billion. Consumer and community banking revenue fell 2.9% to $12.52 billion, below the analyst estimate of $12.78 billion. Corporate and investment bank revenue rose 7.4% to $12.4 billion, above the $11.69 billion estimate.</p><p>In its consumer and community banking unit, combined debit and credit card spending increased by 26%, but loans were down 2% amid prepayments in mortgages and the impact of forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. The loan drop was primarily offset by a 12% increase in auto lending.</p><p>Originations in home lending increased by 43% to $42 billion, and remain at historically high levels.</p><p>In its corporate and investment bank, global investment banking fees jumped 52% amid a surge in M&amp;A activity and initial public offerings. The bank said its commercial banking unit earned a record $1.3 billion of gross investment banking income.</p><p>Commercial banking loans fell 7%, however, but the bank said it's seeing early signs of commercial real-estate loan growth.</p><p>The bank's assets under management in its wealth management unit climbed 17% to $3 trillion.</p><p>During the third quarter, JPMorgan Chase became the first bank to operate branches in all of the Lower 48 states. It is more than half way through its plan to open 400 branches in new markets by the end of 2022, including 30% of these branches in low-to-moderate income communities.</p><p>See Also:Will bank stocks' wild rally continue?
