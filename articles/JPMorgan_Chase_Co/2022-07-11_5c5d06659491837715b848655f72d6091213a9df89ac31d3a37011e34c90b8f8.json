  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Another week, another round of reminders of the headwinds facing global business as it battles against surging inflation, rising interest rates, the energy crisis and another message from China that coronavirus is not yet done. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7418e982-5132-49c6-b3d6-abca50473316\">Chinese stocks</a> fell this morning on news of more Omicron-driven infections in several cities, fuelling fears that damaging lockdowns could return and snag global supply chains in the process. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/778b5220-23fa-4041-9f80-7fa29ee27906#post-c0a79d36-dea5-4407-b65a-d4f1d62c2731\">Shanghai</a> has discovered its first case of the BA.5 sub-variant, raising fears of further restrictions in China's most commercially important city just weeks after a two-month shutdown had caused chaos in global markets. Eleven cities are now under full or partial lockdowns, including a week-long closure of all non-essential businesses in Macau.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Omicron is also driving up hospitalisations in<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4794ae3-70ec-436d-bf76-d89c114e93af\"> Europe and the US</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors are also expecting a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy in the US after Friday's unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb584dce-a910-4579-adc2-6421896dc905\">strong jobs data</a>. But they are also concerned about the flow of gas to Europe after Russia shut its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c01bd8c0-e7e4-4149-a10f-6373cb71c704\">Nordstream 1 pipeline</a> for 10 days of maintenance, adding to fears that Moscow may use the opportunity to stop or trim its exports.</p> <p>In the UK, companies are starting to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ab6fc4a-b05e-44e0-b07f-c02d3350ec28\">“war game” for a recession</a> as consumer demand slows and costs continue to rise. One supermarket boss described September as the “come to Jesus” month — when the penny drops for households that they need to shell out on new school kit just as holiday spending ends and energy costs ratchet up.</p> <p>Those businesses reliant on discretionary spending, such as travel and leisure groups, are likely to be hit especially hard as the post-pandemic spending splurge dries up. </p> <p>The effect of higher interest rates, lower savings and higher energy costs on company finances is likely to become much clearer around Christmas. “The first-quarter results season was good. The second quarter will probably be fine too. The real hit will be more likely in the third quarter or fourth quarter this year,” said one analyst. New UK retail data for June tomorrow will also be closely watched after falls in sales volumes in April and May.</p> <p>One of the few bright spots is pet care. “Most consumers prioritise their pets over spending on themselves,” said investment bank Peel Hunt. “We have always thought that the last three things to ‘go' in a recession are the Sky Sports subscription, the monthly new pair of trainers and the dog.”</p> <p>Even those companies that are meant to flourish during tough times are coming unstuck. Sweden's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66b65d68-d62e-4aec-a1ad-a7d9e2ba0435\">Klarna</a>, the buy now, pay later company that was once Europe's most valuable private fintech, had its valuation slashed today in the clearest sign of the struggles facing the sector as inflation surges and consumers retrench.</p> <p>Cutbacks in discretionary spending are also likely to damage big US retailers. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7d1e34d-f339-4fd4-8157-154cf3135037\">Amazon</a> is hoping its Prime Day promotional jamboree tomorrow can<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7d1e34d-f339-4fd4-8157-154cf3135037\"> rejuvenate slowing sales growth</a>, while bricks-and-mortar stores such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4448eaeb-97ad-4301-99bf-646df720b3a7\">Target</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bd41174-6f7c-4152-9fa0-4a11f2a0ed05\">Walmart</a> have already issued profit warnings.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>UK puts plan for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9657ce7b-fbb0-44fe-867e-284a8ad7dfb1\">windfall levy</a> on electricity generators on hold</p></li>  <li><p>Erdoğan urges Putin to agree to UN plan for safe passage of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/778b5220-23fa-4041-9f80-7fa29ee27906#post-3d57f2c2-1441-4e25-8cae-722aecbd3d14\">Ukrainian grain</a> </p></li>  <li><p>OECD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c94769c-f601-47c5-be60-3ac761019911\">sets deadline</a> for key part of global tax deal</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/778b5220-23fa-4041-9f80-7fa29ee27906\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf does a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e48882ab-e519-4d20-a332-41ec2ecb0d51\">deep dive</a> into the faltering <strong>UK economy</strong>. What is most important is simple to describe and hard to solve: the long-term stagnation in productivity and real incomes. The breakdown in relations with the EU meanwhile was highlighted by Financial Times revelations that the ministerial body that governs Britain's trade deal with Brussels has not met <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66d76172-54b6-4a33-af18-e819f7a5ad20\">for over 13 months</a>.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb1cabdb-7329-4e8a-82a4-fdeba2bac83b\">Cuts of 30 per cent</a> in funds for England's <strong>bus network </strong>as pandemic subsidies end could mean unprofitable routes being slashed and communities isolated.</p> <p><strong>Eurozone</strong> finance ministers meeting in Brussels today have the task of mitigating households' pain from soaring energy prices while not adding to upward pressures on inflation, reports our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fb57c4e-3a35-4d87-b8e6-a9c58c33b7d8\">Europe Express newsletter</a>. <strong>Hungary</strong> made <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/079aa04a-9d44-476c-bfe2-b56835be3660\">concessions to Brussels</a> in the stand-off over the rule of law and transparency as it tried to unlock €15bn in pandemic recovery funds.</p> <p>If history is any guide, the $750bn price tag for rebuilding <strong>Ukraine's economy</strong> is likely to be wide of the mark, says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94c97ce4-3849-4465-8d4b-95f59588be42\">the Lex column</a>.

The crisis is one of the most acute among emerging market economies struggling to service debt as food and commodity prices soar while interest rates ratchet upwards.</p> <p>Quantitative easing is being replaced by <strong>quantitative tightening</strong> as central banks start to shrink their balance sheets. Fund managers however say they have no idea <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/435a5e35-bf30-4518-a4fc-a6d5c2d66076\">how it will play out</a>.</p> <p>The “perfect storm” of soaring inflation, tightening monetary policy and the war in Ukraine has led to investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/563d679c-a14a-42d8-bdf0-29cddfd94fc2\">pulling $50bn</a> from <strong>emerging market</strong> bond funds this year, the most severe outflow in at least 17 years.

So now it's finally going back directionally to a more normal interest rate environment,” said one analyst.</p> <p><strong>Wizz Air</strong> is the latest airline to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60fbaf9e-73df-4435-ae2c-cbe3835ca844\">cut flights</a> as disruption continues at London Heathrow airport. The Hungary-based carrier reported an operating loss of €285mn in the latest quarter and became one of the first airlines in Europe to quantify the financial impact of this summer's disruption, which it said had cost €50mn. </p> <p>In better news for the aviation sector, <strong>Airbus</strong> revised up its estimate for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b633b685-1079-4ba4-a016-18efaf7d242f\">global jet demand</a> over the <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/commercial-aircraft/market/global-market-forecast\">next 20 years</a>, although it said passenger numbers would not grow as fast as previously thought.</p> <p><strong>STMicroelectronics</strong> and <strong>GlobalFoundries</strong> are building a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad626e25-8bed-499a-9440-f5e4c3ff0b67\">semiconductor manufacturing factory</a> in France, a project that will receive significant government support as part of EU efforts to secure supplies and overcome reliance on Asian supplies. “This is the biggest industrial investment in recent decades outside of the nuclear sector and a big step for our industrial sovereignty,” said French finance minister Bruno Le Maire.</p> <p>Many of the <strong>financial innovations</strong> of the past decade — with names such as back-leverage, NAV financing and subscription financing — are about to be tested for the first time in a “down market” as lawyers gear up for a series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e07656a5-6103-487c-8d55-42bb1de56dbc\">bankruptcy cases</a>.
