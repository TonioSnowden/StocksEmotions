  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Treasury to Block Debt Payments  ----  By Alexander Saeedy and Andrew Duehren",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department moved to cut off Russia's ability to make payments on its dollar-denominated sovereign debt, putting Russia on a path toward defaulting on its foreign debts this summer and deepening the country's economic isolation after its invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   Since imposing a raft of sanctions on Russia this year, the U.S. had maintained an exemption allowing U.S. banks and investors to process and receive payments on existing Russian bonds. The Treasury said it would allow the exemption to expire on Wednesday. </p><p>   The U.S. gradually has limited Russia's access to foreign credit since the invasion. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had said the U.S. likely would let the exemption for Americans receiving debt payments expire. </p><p>   Russia has stayed current on around $2.5 billion of foreign debt payments since the conflict in Ukraine began, largely by relying on that exemption and using unsanctioned Russian banks to send payments. Without it in place, Russia will be unable to have U.S.-based financial intermediaries process bond payments on its behalf. </p><p>   Russia faces about $235 million in payments due under some of its dollar-denominated bonds on June 23, and $159 million due June 24, said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. research. The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p></p>",
