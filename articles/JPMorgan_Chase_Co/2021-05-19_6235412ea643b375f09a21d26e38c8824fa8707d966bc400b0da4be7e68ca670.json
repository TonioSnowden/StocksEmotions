TCI, which owns a 3 per cent stake in CN, has demanded that it abandons its current $34bn pursuit of the US group. (Interestingly, TCI is also the largest shareholder in CP with a 8.4 per cent stake).</p> <p>And, per usual, he's got no shortage of strong opinions.</p> <p>“CN already has a tremendous North American rail network; it does not need KCS to prosper in the future. It is time to end this ill-advised misadventure,” he wrote in an open letter to CN's chair <strong>Robert Pace</strong>. Read it in full <a href=\"https://www.tcifund.com/CorporateEngagements/CanadianNationalRailway\">here</a>.</p> <p>In short, TCI has taken issue with CN's plan to create a voting trust — a vehicle that would enable KCS shareholders to get paid before the deal receives full approval from the <strong>Surface Transportation Board</strong>, the main railway regulator.</p> <p>Why? Because if the deal is later blocked by the regulator it could be forced to sell KCS at a loss. In addition, CN would also lose C$2bn in break-up fees if the deal failed to win regulatory approval.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The way Hohn sees it, CN should drop any mention of voting trusts from its takeover bid or walk away from the deal entirely.</p> <p>But for CN, the tie-up is seen as less of an “ill-advised misadventure” and more of a road to riches. Acquiring KCS would allow it to link operations from Canada to Mexico through the US at a time when cross-border trade is expected to pick up significantly.</p> <h2>Eurostar chugs to safety</h2> <p>While we're on the subject, allow DD to take you on another rail journey — this time through the English Channel, where a group of shareholders are banding together to save the <strong>Eurostar</strong> following a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/562fdda5-4b83-440d-8c32-c83210edf833\">diplomatic dispute</a> over who should foot the bill for a rescue package.</p> <p>The Channel Tunnel train operator appeared to be steamrollering toward trouble <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df79de6c-8717-4d09-93ca-7c4eff10ab39\">earlier this year</a>, as passenger numbers plunged and shareholder's pockets were wearing thin.</p> <p>But there is hope. Eurostar has secured a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08f283fd-adca-4337-a9cb-da5cdf58aa4a\">£250m bailout</a> from shareholders including France's state-owned railway group and 55 per cent shareholder <strong>SNCF</strong>, Canadian institutional fund manager <strong>Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec</strong>, <strong>Hermes Infrastructure</strong> and the Belgian state rail operator.</p> <p>It's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d255c12-c8de-4925-a97f-57fd763ab047\">no coincidence</a> that the UK is missing from the list. Transport secretary <strong>Grant Shapps </strong>said in February that Eurostar was “not our company to rescue” given it was majority owned by the French state.</p> <p>As it turns out, the French newspaper<strong> Le Figaro</strong> may have been wrong when it declared the train “the end of British insularity” when it first opened in 1994.</p> <p>As vaccines roll out and business travellers venture back into a post-Brexit world, that theory will be tested once again.</p> <h2>The sprint to become south-east Asia's everything-app</h2> <p>The stakes in south-east Asia's great “super app” rivalry just got higher.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce944c28-a6d1-42b9-9da2-12e90cb2ae19\">$18bn alliance</a> between Indonesian start-ups <strong>Gojek</strong> and<strong> Tokopedia </strong>has spawned a ride-hailing, ecommerce, delivery and payments behemoth to rival Singapore's <strong>SoftBank</strong>-backed <strong>Grab</strong>.</p> <p>Like its largest competitor, the new company — coined <strong>GoTo</strong> — is on a mad dash to the public markets before the hype cools down, writes the FT's Mercedes Ruehl in a dispatch from Singapore.</p> <p>Executives are targeting a dual listing in New York and Jakarta by the end of the year, with a public market valuation of up to $40bn. And the sooner the better — the company is burning through cash as it competes with Grab, south-east Asia's most valuable start-up.</p> <p>The rival tech group plans to join the <strong>Nasdaq </strong>through a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">$40bn Spac deal</a> later this year, making it the largest merger between a private business and a Spac to date if all goes as planned.</p> <p><em>*Note: this chart was created before Gojek Tokopedia agreed to their merger</em></p> <p>Meanwhile, the two face a well-financed foe, the <strong>Shopee</strong>-owned, Nasdaq-listed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8454485d-7054-41ae-9f7c-0e81d6e1b21b\"><strong>Sea</strong></a> group, which is increasingly expanding its turf across financial services and food delivery. It's now a more than $100bn company thanks to its fast-rising share price.</p> <p>There's big money on the line. SoftBank, <strong>Tencent</strong>, <strong>Alibaba</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Warburg Pincus</strong>,<strong> KKR</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong> and <strong>Visa</strong> are among the players with skin in the game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Some, like SoftBank and Tencent, have bet on more than one horse.</p> <p>And it's off to the races.</p> <p>(For more on the booming world of Asia tech, subscribe to #TechAsia <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/subscribe?result=%7B%22successful%22%3A%5B%7B%22newsletterId%22%3A%225c8b92df81ab3b00044a2110%22%7D%5D%2C%22unsuccessful%22%3A%5B%5D%7D\">here</a>, the FT and Nikkei's&#xa0; must-read weekly briefing.)</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Gordon Smith</strong>, a top lieutenant of <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> boss <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, is to step down from his role at the end of the year.
