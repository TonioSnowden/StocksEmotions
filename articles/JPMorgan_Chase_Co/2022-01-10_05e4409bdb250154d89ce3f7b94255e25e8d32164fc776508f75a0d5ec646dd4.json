  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 300 points, or 0.8%, to about 35,931.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX declined 35 points, or 0.7%, to around 4,642.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP gave up 136 points, or 0.9%, to 14,800, trading at the lowest level in nearly three months. The index needs to stay above 14,451.69 to avoid falling into correction territory, widely defined as a fall of 10% from a recent peak.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow finished nearly unchanged, but the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1%. According to FactSet, growth stocks underperformed value stocks last week by the most since election week 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Investors are positioning for the prospect of higher interest rates as soon as March, with parts of Wall Street joining many economists in saying the Fed has waited far too long to hike. Traders are also bracing for a consumer-prices report on Wednesday that could show a 7% headline year-over-year rise for December, and similar gains that won't let up until the March reading.The Nasdaq Composite, though off its worst levels, faced an intense selloff earlier on Monday, and is trading near its lowest level since mid-October while threatening to close below its 200-day moving average, at 14,688.73, for the first time since April 21, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index needs to stay above 14,451.69 to avoid a correction, &#xa0;defined by market technicians as a 10% fall from a recent peak.Read: As stock market unravels Monday, here's the level the Nasdaq needs to defend to avoid a correction</p><p>In an interview that aired on Monday, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told CNBC that the U.S. is headed for the best growth in decades, and that he'd be surprised if the Fed hikes by only four times this year. That's more than the three hikes signaled by Fed officials in their December projections.Economists at both Deutsche Bank DB and Goldman Sachs GS expect four rate hikes this year, and a reduction of the Fed's more than $8 trillion balance sheet that could begin in the third quarter. But Deutsche's researchers also see the possibility that policy makers might need to consider hiking interest rates at almost every meeting in 2022 “unless financial conditions notably tighten,” Jim Reid, head of thematic research, and others wrote in a Monday note.Read: Almost every Federal Reserve meeting in 2022 could be potentially `at play' for a potential rate hike, Deutsche Bank saysGoldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a note late Sunday that “declining labor market slack has made Fed officials more sensitive to upside inflation risks and less sensitive to downside growth risks.”Friday's labor report came in at 199,000 jobs in December, worse than forecast, but it also showed a decline in the unemployment rate to a pandemic low and a rise in wages.&#xa0;The labor-market reading came after Fed minutes released last Wednesday signaled that policy makers are eager to tighten financial policy to battle inflation, with market-based projections pointing to at least three interest-rate increases this year.</p><p>Read: Jekyll-and-Hyde U.S. jobs report not as ugly as it looks</p><p>Some analysts are adopting a much more sanguine view of the market's outlook, despite the eminent tightening of financial conditions. In a Monday note, BlackRock Investment Institute's global chief investment strategist, Wei Li, and others said that although central banks will move away from emergency stimulus, they won't necessarily “hit the brakes by raising rates to restrictive levels.” In addition, the three rate hikes being penciled in by policy makers for this year is “more than we expected.” “We prefer equities and would use COVID-related selloffs to add to risk,” they wrote.</p><p>Later in the week, investors will watch the confirmation hearing of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, followed by one for Lael Brainard, the Fed governor who has been nominated to become the central bank's No. 2 after Vice Chairman Richard Clarida steps down. A report on U.S. retail sales is due on Friday.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Lululemon AthleticaLULU warned fourth-quarter earnings and revenue would be at the low end of its target, citing the impact of the omicron variant on capacity and staff. Shares fell 3%.</p><p>Shares of Take-Two Interactive SoftwareTTWO were in focus after it said it would acquire ZyngaZNGA in a deal with enterprise value of $12.7 billion. The company intends to pay $3.50 in cash and $6.36 in Take-Two shares for each share of Zynga. Take-Two shares dropped 16%, while Zynga shares soared 42%.</p><p>Popular meme stock GameStop Corp.'s shares GME were down 8.9% after outperforming some of its competitors on Friday.</p><p>Visa Inc. V shares slipped 2.8% after Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev downgraded the company's shares to neutral from buy on Friday. Dolev said that COVID-19 has sped up the move away from cash, but “dramatically and likely permanently shortened the cash-to-card conversion runway” — giving Visa possibly fewer opportunities for revenue growth going forward.</p><p>Nike Inc. NKE shares fell 4.5% after The Fly reported that HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg downgraded his rating on the stock to hold from buy, and trimmed the stock's &#xa0;price target to $182.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.78%, following the&#xa0;biggest weekly gain&#xa0;since September 2019 based on 3 p.m. Eastern Time levels, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
