  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s first-quarter profit dropped 42%, weighed down by lower Wall Street fees and higher expenses.</p><p>The nation's biggest bank earned $8.28 billion, or $2.63 per share, compared with $14.3 billion, or $4.50 per share, a year ago. Analysts had expected $2.72 per share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue fell 5% to $30.72 billion, ahead of analyst expectations for $30.59 billion.</p><p>Total expenses, a line investors were watching closely, rose 2% to $19.19 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with expectations. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has stressed the bank needs to invest in its future and that the postpandemic era is the right time to do it.</p><p>JPMorgan took $1.5 billion in total credit charges for the quarter; a year ago, the bank got a $4.2 billion boost from freeing up money it had earlier set aside for potential defaults.</p><p>In consumer banking, revenue fell 2% while profit dropped 57%, hurt particularly by the credit comparison to a year ago.</p><p>In the corporate and investment bank, revenue dropped 7% and profit fell 26%.</p><p>Total loans increased 6%, a welcome sign after two years of sluggish loan growth. Those loans were also more profitable. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month and is expected to continue hiking them throughout the year, and higher rates allow banks to charge more on loans.</p><p>The bank's net interest margin, a measure of what it collects on loans minus what it pays for deposits, rose to 1.67% from 1.63% at the end of December.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan's Profit Sinks 42% in First Quarter</p>",
