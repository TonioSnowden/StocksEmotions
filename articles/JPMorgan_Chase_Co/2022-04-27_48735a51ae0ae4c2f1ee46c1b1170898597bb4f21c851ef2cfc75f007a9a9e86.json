  "title": "Ray-Ban  Maker  Sues Bank  Over Theft  ----  By David Benoit",
  "text": "<p>   The eyewear company that owns Ray-Ban and LensCrafters has sued JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., accusing it of failing to notice that thieves had transferred more than $272 million out of one of its bank accounts in 2019. </p><p>   A unit of EssilorLuxottica SA, the world's largest eyewear company, accused the bank of failing to spot a \"highly suspicious pattern of fraudulent transactions,\" allowing thieves to blow through a daily withdrawal limit of $10 million at least nine times over several months. </p><p>   JPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. </p><p>   Essilor disclosed the theft in late 2019, saying it would take a loss. In the lawsuit, the company said an employee at its Thailand plant managed to fake authorization of 243 payments to shell companies scattered across Asia. The company has recovered about $100 million of the stolen funds, according to the lawsuit. </p><p>   Essilor accused JPMorgan of failing to monitor the account properly and said it should have noticed a series of changes from its normal behavior. </p><p>   For instance, the volume of transactions and dollars moving out of the New York account suddenly skyrocketed to more than $140 million from about $15 million a month. The individual transactions were all done in round numbers, without cents, and authorizations took less than a minute instead of hours, the lawsuit said. </p><p>   The money was sent to shell companies with names such as Guangzhou Wendy Hair Products or Citgo Oil Trading LLC, signaling they weren't in the eye-care business, according to the lawsuit. </p><p>   Essilor is seeking a trial for an unspecified amount of damages from the bank. </p><p></p>",
