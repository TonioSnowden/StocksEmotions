  "title": "Wall Street Sanctions Against Russia, Alaska; Isn't it time for U.S. financial institutions to stop discriminating against U.S. petroleum production?",
  "text": "<p>The Journal's David Benoit notedon Friday:</p><p>Wall Street banks are backing away from a country they had once hoped to help bring into the Western financial system.</p><p>Two weeks into the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. banks are following a slew of multinational companies that have announced plans to stop doing business in Russia.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are unwinding existing Russia ties and eschewing new ones. Citi group Inc., which has the biggest Russian presence among its peers, is mulling its future in the country, having already announced plans to sell its branch network there.</p><p>It's nice that banks are helping President Joe Biden apply economic pressure to Russia. Now both Washington and Wall Street should stop applying pressure to domestic energy producers.</p><p>When Goldman Sachs announced its economic sanctions hitting Arctic energy development in 2019, this column reported:</p><p>Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R., Alaska) says that he and his fellow Alaskans will have to decide \"whether we want to do business\" with Goldman Sachs anymore. And who can blame Alaska if it chooses to cut ties with the Wall Street megabank?</p><p>In an update to its environmental policy, Goldman says: \"We will decline any financing transaction that directly supports new upstream Arctic oil exploration or development.\"</p><p>The financial giant is receiving applause from green groups. But in a visit to the Journal this week, Gov. Dunleavy says the decision will have real costs for Alaskans and the U.S. economy while generating unintended environmental consequences. That's because many oil-producing regions of the world have much less stringent environmental regulation than Alaska does. \"You're going to push jobs and wealth and revenues\" to overseas areas and \"exacerbate\" ecological problems, adds the governor.</p><p>Mr. Dunleavy has also known all along, even if it's taking forever for Wall Street to acknowledge it, that pushing energy production out of the U.S. enriches the world's bad guys. Yet the Wall Street-Washington crowd's discriminatory treatment of U.S. petroleum producers has created an almost comedic situation in which people sitting on enormous oil reserves are scrambling to restrain the price of gasoline.</p><p>James Brooks of the Anchorage Daily News reports from Juneau:</p><p>Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Alaska state senators said Friday that they support legislation to suspend the state's tax on motor fuels for one year, an attempt to reduce the impact of rising fuel prices on Alaskans.</p><p>No such legislation has yet been introduced, but Dunleavy called for a suspension to be added to a bill advancing toward a vote on the House floor. Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, is the author of that bill and said he supports the temporary suspension as long as the underlying bill remains intact.</p><p>Alaska's gas tax is 8 cents per gallon, the lowest in the country. Based on the average number of miles driven per year in the state — 9,111 miles, according to the Federal Highway Administration — and the average fuel economy of an American vehicle, which is 18.1 miles per gallon, suspending the tax would save an Alaska driver around $40.24 per year.</p><p>Of course consumers all over America are feeling the pain in the Biden era of inflation. And they would all benefit from reform that enables more domestic energy supply.</p><p>Mr. Brooks and his Anchorage Daily News colleague Iris Samuels recently noted:</p><p>U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan wrote a letter to Biden last week calling on him to encourage financial institutions to invest in domestic energy production and fast-track oil extraction from the Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, among other steps...</p><p>Many banks and investment firms have enacted environmental policies that prohibit them from financing oil and gas projects on the North Slope.</p><p>Alaska state officials met with investment banks last week in New York City, urging them to change policies that prevent them from financing oil and gas projects north of the Arctic Circle.</p><p>\"Everything I've been told by the capital providers and banks — other than the big institutions like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan — is that they're looking for good project financials, good compliance records in the companies and projects and locations with good (environmental and social) track records,\" [Corri Feige, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources] said. \"That's Alaska in spades.\"</p><p>The Dunleavy administration is taking a hard line on the topic. Dunleavy said Tuesday that he intends to introduce legislation that will require the state to end business dealings with companies that refuse to invest in Arctic oil drilling. That legislation will be introduced next week, according to an official with the governor's office.</p><p>The governor should take a hard line. Are we to assume from Ms. Feige's comments that Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan won't even consider Arctic projects from people with records of producing energy with minimal impact on local environments? How do they think oil gets produced in Putin's Russia and do they think he will stop in obedience to their climate pose?</p><p>While we wait for Wall Street to abandon its sanctions against U.S. energy production, there is some good news from Washington, believe it or not. Specifically, the Senate has chosen not to add additional sanctions on the American oil industry. The Journal's Andrew Ackerman reports from Washington:</p><p>Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden's pick to become the Federal Reserve's top banking regulator, suffered a blow Monday when a key Democrat expressed opposition to her nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.</p><p>Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said in a statement that he couldn't support Ms. Raskin's nomination to become the Fed's vice chairwoman of banking supervision, imperiling her confirmation chances in the evenly divided Senate... \"Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation's critical energy needs,\" Mr. Manchin said...</p><p>Republicans, especially from energy-producing states such as Pennsylvania and Wyoming, are opposed to Ms. Raskin in part because of her 2020 criticism of the Treasury Department and Fed providing broad-based emergency-lending backstops to assist businesses during the pandemic. She said the backstops should have been designed to avoid lending to highly indebted fossil-fuel companies.</p><p>The last thing the Federal Reserve needs is a governor seeking to use a crisis to apply discriminatory treatment against U.S. energy producers.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>***</p><p>Wall Street Sanctions Against Russia, Alaska</p>",
