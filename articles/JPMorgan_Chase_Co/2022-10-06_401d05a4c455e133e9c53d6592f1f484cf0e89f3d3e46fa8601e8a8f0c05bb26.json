  "title": "Why this chart watcher thinks the stock market can rise the rest of the year; Bullish technical divergence, deeply negative sentiment readings point to 'material asymmetric' risk-reward scenario for bulls",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 index's SPX two-day surge of 5.7% through Tuesday, which was the best two-day start to a quarter in 84 years, triggered a \"cluster\" of momentum divergence buy signals. Given that those signals coincide with a \"deep oversold\" technical condition and historically bearish sentiment readings, Hunter believes the rally can continue.</p><p>Hunter thinks the bounce could ultimately take the S&amp;P 500 back up to test prior resistance at the 200-day moving average, which many chart watchers view as a dividing line between longer-term uptrends and downtrends. The 200-day extends to 4,199 on Wednesday, according to FactSet, which is about 12% above current levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% Wednesday, but pared an earlier intraday loss of as much as 1.8%.</p><p>One reason for Hunter's bullish view is that the S&amp;P 500's bounce unfolded from \"deep oversold internal breadth\" readings, which suggests the number of declining stocks relative to advancers has stretched to levels that coincided with market bounces in the past.</p><p>Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group, said just prior to the S&amp;P 500's big bounce, the 25-day up-down volume technical indicator was at a level associated with an \"oversold\" condition for 10-straight days, and was at a more extreme oversold reading than at the June low, which preceded a two-month uptrend that took the S&amp;P 500 up 17%.</p><p>In addition, the AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors showed those who were bearish on stocks reached 60.9% during the week ended Sept. 21, the highest percentage seen since the week of March 5, 2009, or just before the S&amp;P 500 bottomed after the financial crisis.</p><p>And JPMorgan's Hunter said the stock market is \"poised to potentially confirm a weekly momentum diverging buy signal, (that) historically has had a good hit rate for the S&amp;P 500 index.\"</p><p>A bullish technical divergence refers to when prices keep trending lower even after some momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), have started trending higher. The RSI is a widely followed oscillating indicator that tracks the magnitude of losses relative to the magnitude of recent gains.
