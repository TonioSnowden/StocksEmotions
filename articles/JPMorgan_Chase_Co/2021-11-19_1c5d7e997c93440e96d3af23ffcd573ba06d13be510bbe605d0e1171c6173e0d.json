  "text": "<p>Smaller UK investment trusts have been merging at a rapid clip this year, in a wave of consolidation driven by shareholder concerns over costs and liquidity. </p> <p>This year has seen the announcement of six mergers, twice as many as in the previous two years. Two of the oldest funds, the Scottish Investment Trust and the JPMorgan Global Growth and Income — both 134 years old — <a href=\"https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2021/10/20/scottish-investment-trust-plans-1-2bn-jp-morgan-merger/\">plan to join up</a> in the first quarter of next year, bringing together a £1.2bn portfolio.</p> <p>The push to consolidate is fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5a2cf12-f837-4f5a-b749-14763e4bbf38\">growing demand from shareholders </a>for bigger, more liquid trusts which are cheaper to run and potentially perform better. </p> <p>Simon Elliott, head of investment trust research at Winterflood, the securities market maker, said the growing number of mergers is “a positive development” for the industry. The resulting companies were more liquid with “more competitive cost bases” for investors, he said.</p> <p>Underperformance is a factor that can lead boards to turn to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccf1eeb4-1e22-45db-8a86-04722f936b49\">management changes and consolidation</a>. Before its deal with JPMorgan Global Growth and Income, the Scottish Investment Trust appointed consultants to review its management, as its board said that their returns had underperformed the sterling return on the MSCI All Country World Index over the past five years.</p> <p>Analysts at Winterflood say JPMorgan Global Growth and Income is a “highly suitable partner for Scottish Investment Trust” given its long-term performance. It has been the best-performing global equity income fund over the past three years, with a net asset total return of 61 per cent.</p> <p>Although consolidation among smaller funds is welcome across the industry, David Harris, partner at Frostrow Capital, a trust services company, said that mergers which aren't accompanied by convincing strategies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5a2cf12-f837-4f5a-b749-14763e4bbf38\">to make the most use of their trust structure </a>— such as specialisation and leverage — might not be advantageous.</p> <p>The active management sector remains “under threat from passive funds because investors who want index exposure can buy that passively at a lower fee level”, said Harris. For boards which aren't harnessing the advantages of their structure, “the question is, do they deserve to exist, irrespective of mergers”?</p> <p>Aside from performance, the size of an investment trust increasingly influences investors' appetite. </p> <p>“Size is increasingly acting as a barrier to investment,” said Elliott. Smaller trusts can be expensive to run as their costs are spread between fewer shareholders. </p> <p>By contrast, bigger investment trusts can benefit from economies of scale, which can mean more competitive fees for shareholders. </p> <p>Arthur Copple, chair of the board at Temple Bar Investment Trust, said mergers come “with no tax consequences for shareholders”. Getting extra assets for the management company “almost always makes a contribution or pays the costs of the transaction”.</p> <p>Smaller trusts are also less liquid, meaning their shares are more difficult to trade for shareholders. Funds with increased liquidity are “more attractive” to investors and thus more likely to have “a higher rating” on shares, Copple added. </p> <p>Both size and liquidity also increase visibility on retail platforms, said Ewan Lovett-Turner, director at Numis Securities. </p> <p>Harris thought the growth of platform markets over the past decade had boosted demand for bigger trusts. He argued that it is “not uncommon” for retail and advisers platforms to hold up to 40 per cent of shares in a trust. </p> <p>Excluding venture capital trusts, 17 per cent of investment companies — 61 out of 351 — have less than £100m of total assets, according to the Association of Investment Companies. Investment companies are considered small when their total assets value is below £100m, often the minimum amount needed to be raised in launching an IPO. </p> <p>Copple said there remain many relatively small trusts with “high ongoing charges,” adding that their high expenses “eat into performance for shareholders”.</p> <p>Boards should be “realistic” about their prospects and ready to “make some hard decisions if it is clear there is little chance of reaching a viable size”, according to Elliott.</p> <p>But most analysts agree there is still room for small investment trusts, notably those with highly specialist mandates. “There are some areas like microcaps, where small can be beautiful and you don't want to expand past the capacity of the strategy,” said Lovett-Turner. </p> <p>Although a £100m micro cap fund would be considered small for a UK equity income strategy, its size would allow it to deploy capital into smaller markets. </p> <p>“It's all about the ability to deploy the capital into the market you're investing in” said Harris, “if that market is smaller you can be smaller yourself and nimble”. Some specialised micro cap funds indeed commit to staying around £100m as part of their strategy.</p><p>Source: Akila Quinio and Joshua Oliver 2021 'Investment trust mergers aim to boost returns' FT.com 19 November.
