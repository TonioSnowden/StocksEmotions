  "text": "<p>Pub groups Marston's and Mitchells &amp; Butlers reported an encouraging return to trading following last month's relaxing of lockdown restrictions, though both companies cautioned that it was too early to talk of recovery.</p> <p>Marston's delivered an underlying pre-tax loss for its fiscal first half of £122m, offset by a £291m profit in the period from the disposal of the brewing operations. On recent trading Marston's said like-for-like sales since outside reopening were around 80 per cent of pre-Covid levels and that it broke even on an ebitda level in April. </p> <p>M&amp;B said half-year sales were £219m against £1.04bn last year, resulting in a pre-tax loss widening to £200m from £121m the year before. Sales since reopening were down 37 per cent on pre-Covid levels.</p> <p>It said: “Whilst uncertainty and challenges still remain, we are encouraged by the successful roll out of the Covid-19 vaccination programme and the fall in infection rates and are confident, given the demand that we have seen so far since reopenings, that we will see strong consumer confidence in our brands supporting a rebound to profitability and cash generation once restrictions are fully eased.”</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Infrastructure investor <strong>John Laing</strong> has agreed to a £2bn buyout offer from private equity group KKR. The recommended cash offer of 403p a share is a 27 per cent premium to the closing price on May 5, the day before KKR's bidding intentions were made public. Soros Capital Management, a 4.1 per cent shareholder in John Laing, has provided a letter of intent to vote in favour of the takeover, the company said. </p> <p>Homewares retailer <strong>Dunelm</strong> said strong trading since stores reopened meant profit will be significantly ahead of analysts' expectations. The company reported that sales in the first seven weeks of its fourth quarter beginning March were 59 per cent higher than the equivalent pre-Covid period in 2019. Pent-up demand, cold weather and growth from its digital channels supported a full-year pre-tax profit in excess of £148m, well above market expectations of between £128m and £134m, it said.</p> <p><strong>Severn Trent</strong> posted pre-tax profit of £470.7m for the year ending March, down 17 per cent year on year but in line with expectations, as a result of a rebasing of tariffs and investment into improving performance. Turnover was 0.9 per cent lower at £1.8bn as lockdowns reduced total consumption. In conjunction with results the water utility launched a share placing to raise £250m, which will help fund its environmental projects recently backed by regulator Ofwat's Green Recovery Award programme. </p> <p><strong>Future</strong>, the magazine publisher, said first half trading to March was materially ahead of expectations with&#xa0;record revenue up 89 per cent&#xa0;to £272.6m and adjusted operating profit up 124 per cent&#xa0;to £89.2m. Black Friday and Christmas shoppers drove 31 per cent growth in online users and a 21 per cent improvement in organic revenue, it said. Future also said to expect full year performance to be materially ahead of market expectations, underpinned by the “exceptional” first half performance.</p> <p><strong>Experian</strong>, the credit checking agency, said full-year pre-tax profit to March grew 14 per cent to $1bn thanks to double-digit revenue growth from its consumer services divisions. For the fourth quarter alone the company posted organic revenue growth of 5 per cent, at the top end of its guidance range. “We are off to a strong start to 2022 and expect first-quarter organic revenue growth in the range of 15-20 per cent which&#xa0;gives us every confidence of another successful year ahead,” the company said.</p> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> said it remains on track to meet full-year guidance. A good operational performance since the start of the year underpins confidence, with maritime, electronic systems and intelligence divisions all continuing to perform strongly, the arms maker said. </p> <p><strong>Ferguson</strong>, the US focused plumbers' merchant, posted a 65 per cent jump in trading profit to $579m for its fiscal third quarter ended April. Price hikes helped deliver 20.1 per cent organic growth from the US, where economies reopening meant demand accelerated through the quarter, the company said. </p> <p><strong>Great Portland Estates</strong> has cut its property valuation by 8.7 per cent to £2.5bn at the end of its fiscal year to March, reflecting a 1.7 per cent reduction for offices and a 27.3 per cent downgrade for the retail portfolio. The central London property developer said it was encouraged by a recent acceleration in inquiries from prospective occupiers, particularly for prime and flexible offices. Great Portland added that while all its offices were now open for business just 29 per cent of the space was currently being used. </p> <p><strong>Premier Foods</strong> reinstated its dividend after posting a 24 per cent improvement in headline pre-tax profit to £117.9m for its year ended early April. Revenue grew 10 per cent to £947m as the maker of Bisto gravy powder and Batchelors sauces stepped up marketing and expanded its market share. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has elevated two potential successors to chief executive Jamie Dimon in a reshuffle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e31d7a7-4911-493b-919d-31e04d756438\">of its top ranks</a> in which co-chief operating officer Gordon Smith will step down from his roles at the end of the year. JPMorgan veterans Marianne Lake, 51, and Jennifer Piepszak, 51, will become co-heads of the consumer and community banking unit, the bank's largest division by revenue. Both are considered potential replacements for Dimon when he eventually steps down.</p> <p>UK hedge fund manager Chris Hohn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de3f3da0-ac4f-4d01-950b-748796fa3bb1\">has demanded</a> that <strong>Canadian National</strong> abandon its current $34bn pursuit of US railway rival <strong>Kansas City Southern</strong>. Hohn's hedge fund TCI, the fifth-largest shareholder in CN with a 3 per cent stake worth $2.3bn, told the Montreal-based company on Tuesday to drop a key feature of its takeover bid or walk away from the deal immediately.</p> <p>The US stock market debut of the Swedish oat milk producer <strong>Oatly</strong> marks a milestone for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37d6985-5c48-46f4-8b02-a67c1a6dfd01\">the company's chief executive</a> Toni Petersson. Since joining what was already an 18-year-old company in 2012, the entrepreneur has transformed a relatively obscure business into something closer to a lifestyle statement for the young and fashionable. The company is due to price its&#xa0;initial public offering&#xa0;today and is targeting a valuation of $10bn.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong> <br>The jump in&#xa0;US annual consumer price inflation to 4.2 per cent&#xa0;reported last week was a shock. But was it a good reason to panic?&#xa0;The big reasons for concern are not what is happening right now, but rather <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d2aef18-e9c4-486a-8323-c5fc6addf5f7\">the political forces at work</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>Homeserve is an acquisition machine with a patchy disclosure record. It still needs to prove <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9322c8c8-a7ce-42ed-8167-371e337022c2\">the investment case</a> is legit.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Pub groups welcome relaxing of restrictions after profits fall' FT.com 19 May.
