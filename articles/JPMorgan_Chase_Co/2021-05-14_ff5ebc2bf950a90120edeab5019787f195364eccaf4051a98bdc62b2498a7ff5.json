  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Race to Replace Libor Heats Up  ----  By Julia-Ambra Verlaine",
  "text": "<p>   New contenders are emerging in the race to get rid of the London interbank offered rate by year-end. </p><p>   Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. traded the first complex derivative using a Bloomberg index crafted to replace Libor, exchanging $250 million worth of an interest-rate swap earlier this month. The Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index competes with the alternative preferred by regulators including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </p><p>   The transaction between the two large Wall Street firms marks a shift in the yearslong plan to move away from the troubled rate underpinning trillions of dollars in financial contracts, with some analysts now saying several benchmarks are likely to replace Libor. Libor underpins trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts and is scheduled for replacement at the end of 2021 in the wake of a manipulation scandal. </p><p>   The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, consisting of major banks, insurers and asset managers working alongside the New York Fed, have been rallying investors and companies to move to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. While large banks and mortgage lenders like Fannie Mae started actively using the benchmark, some large U.S. corporations and other borrowers held off, seeking a benchmark that could fix rates over longer time spans. </p><p>   Bankers said clients are using the Bloomberg index because the ARCC has been slow to roll out those forward-looking reference rates. The committee initially planned to recommend such a rate by the beginning of 2021. After it held off, citing a lack of sufficient transactions and data, some treasurers and traders took matters into their own hands. </p><p>   Thomas Pluta, global head of linear rates trading at JPMorgan, said the delay breathed life into competing rates, and his trading desk saw high demand for the Bloomberg rate from clients. \"The Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index is very similar to Libor, so people comprehend what it is,\" he said. \"It has emerged as the most likely front-runner among the credit-sensitive rates being developed.\" </p><p>   Mr. Pluta said he expects SOFR will emerge as the primary rate used in financial markets, but some borrowers will choose alternatives more suited to their needs. Some regional banks are using Ameribor, a rate created by futures guru Richard Sandor, because it changes with their funding costs. Set on the American Financial Exchange, the rate reflects what banks pay to lend to each other through mutual lines of credit. </p><p>   SOFR is an overnight rate dubbed nearly risk-free, which means it doesn't reflect increased costs of funding during a crisis. Sonali Theisen, head of fixed-income e-trading and market structure at Bank of America, said that makes switching complex for borrowers who need a rate sensitive to market conditions, such as corporate treasurers, who like to fix payments in advance. \"Providing the market more than one option, particularly to support loan transition, seems prudent,\" she said. \"We are looking to provide our clients choice.\" </p><p>   The ARRC is making an effort to speed up its support for forward-looking rates, also known as term rates, in the financial industry. It recently published a list of standards to back longer dated SOFR rates in a bid to increase its adoption. Tom Wipf, a Morgan Stanley banker who leads ARRC, said the committee was taking its time to make sure the rates would be based on sufficient transactions. </p><p>   \"Recent developments underscore there is very strong demand for a term rate,\" said Mr. Wipf. \"It's clear that this last piece of puzzle is important to the market. </p><p></p>",
