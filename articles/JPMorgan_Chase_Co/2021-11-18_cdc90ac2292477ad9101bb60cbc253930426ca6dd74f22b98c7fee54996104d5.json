  "title": "Biden Nominee to Oversee Big Banks Faces Criticism at Senate Hearing; Saule Omarova, the pick for Comptroller of the Currency, testifies before lawmakers",
  "text": "<p>\"Do you see how risky that is, to make that statement?\" said Mr. Tester, a third-generation family farmer who said he feared a lone regulator with the discretion to decide whether to put his farm out of business. \"Do you see how dangerous that could be?\"</p><p>Ms. Omarova, who is nominated to become the Comptroller of the Currency, said she misspoke and that her remarks weren't well-framed. \"My intention was…exactly the opposite,\" she said. \"We need to help those companies to get restructured.\"</p><p>Support from moderate Democrats will be crucial to advancing the nomination of Ms. Omarova, a law professor at Cornell University, through the evenly divided Senate. Messrs. Tester and Warner were noncommittal and said they also were concerned about Ms. Omarova's opposition to 2018 legislation that eased post-financial-crisis rules on banks that they both helped author. With Republicans potentially unified in their opposition, Ms. Omarova likely needs to win approval from all Senate Democrats to secure the job.</p><p>Mr. Biden earlier this month nominated her to the post that supervises the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Her past academic work calling for shrinking big banks and creating a much bigger role for the Federal Reserve in consumer banking has generated a backlash. Industry advocates and some Republicans have said she favors policies that would effectively nationalize lending and envisions an overly large role for the government that would crimp banks' business.</p><p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent bureau of the Treasury Department. It oversees about 1,200 banks with total assets of $14 trillion, about two-thirds of the total in the U.S. banking system.</p><p>Ms. Omarova's defenders include liberal-leaning Democrats such as Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the committee chairman, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. They say she is an accomplished banking expert who will stand up to the industry. The senators say Washington regulators have been too deferential to big banks in recent years and that Ms. Omarova would work to make the financial system more inclusive for consumers.</p><p>At Thursday's hearing, Ms. Omarova pushed back against concerns some have raised about her ideas and background.</p><p>\"Having grown up in an oppressive state-run system, with no free enterprise and no economic opportunity, I have a unique appreciation for our dynamic and diverse markets,\" Ms. Omarova, who was born in Kazakhstan when it was part of the Soviet Union, told the committee. \"Every American family should have the same opportunities that my family has had.\"</p><p>With strong objections coming from the financial industry, Ms. Omarova's confirmation prospects have been uncertain for weeks. The Independent Community Bankers Association on Wednesday asked Senate lawmakers to reject Ms. Omarova, saying that her views are too extreme. Pressure from community bankers, who have a large grass roots presence across the U.S., could sway moderate Democrats against her.</p><p>Mr. Warner said he was disappointed in Ms. Omarova's opposition to a 2018 law that eased regulations on regional and smaller banks, echoing criticism raised earlier by Mr. Tester.</p><p>Ms. Omarova said she favored some of the law's aims, such as lowering the regulatory burdens on small, community banks. But she said she feared the law would be used by regulators to ease rules on larger firms. \"Indirectly it might have helped the big banks,\" she said.</p><p>Two other Democratic members of the committee whom industry opponents have lobbied to oppose Ms. Omarova—Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona—attended the hearing virtually but didn't ask questions.</p><p>The rhetoric against Ms. Omarova has become unusually heated compared with the discussion of Mr. Biden's other regulatory nominees. Some Republicans, such as Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), say Ms. Omarova favors a Soviet-style takeover of the financial system.</p><p>Mr. Toomey, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the law professor's policies, rather than place of birth, are driving his opposition to her nomination. \"Her ideas amount to a socialist manifesto for American financial services,\" Mr. Toomey said Thursday.</p><p>Opponents fear that Ms. Omarova would carry out a progressive agenda if confirmed. Industry advocates and Republican critics cite a 2019 article in which she argued that the Fed should shrink large banks in certain circumstances.</p><p>Another recent paper envisioned shifting consumer-bank deposits from private firms to the Fed, a structural change she described as radical to help make finance more inclusive. She has said the shift could be designed to help, and not hurt, community banks.</p><p>At Thursday's hearing, Ms. Omarova sought to distance herself from her academic work, saying her articles are designed to \"expand the boundaries of the academic debate\" and to raise ideas for Congress to consider. She said it is up to lawmakers, for instance, to weigh whether to shift consumer deposits to the Fed as policy makers consider issues such as a so-called central bank digital currency.</p><p>Republicans said they were still troubled by her ideas.</p><p>\"It doesn't seem to be a coincidence that every one of these thought experiments...involved dramatic expansion in the power and control of the central government to allocate resources, to control banking,\" Mr. Toomey said.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Nominee to Oversee Big Banks Faces Criticism at Senate Hearing</p>",
