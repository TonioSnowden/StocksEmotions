  "text": "<p>Looking at a quarter's price and volume action, it can be hard to always forecast opportunities for profit available to Wall Street banks. Wall Street often talks about \"good volatility\" and \"bad volatility,\" with the former being an opportunity to help clients do big new trades or deals, and the latter meaning clients retreat and revenue dries up. The latest quarter likely had some of both, but there are reasons to expect some positive surprises.</p><p>In the \"bad\" column, corporate clients were understandably cautious as Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to a big drop in activity such as debt issuance, stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions. Figures compiled by Autonomous Research suggest that the first-quarter global industry fee pool in investment banking was down by about one-third versus last year.</p><p>That said, some indicators pointed toward a still-busy quarter. Average U.S. daily cash-equities volume by number of shares traded in the first quarter dropped 12% from a record level a year ago, according to analysts at Piper Sandler. But the year-earlier period was the peak of the \"meme\" stock boom -- and the first quarter this year was still the second-highest ever, according to Piper. Day traders aren't Wall Street's bread and butter; institutions are.</p><p>Meanwhile, there was a more-than-fourfold surge in volatility in interest-rate markets, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. Flurries of trading around inflation and Federal Reserve policy could fuel other corners of fixed income and currencies. Moody's analysts also noted an increase in trading of major credit-related exchange-traded funds and fixed income, currency and commodity futures and options. This is reflective of hedging activity and demand for the underlying assets, which can \"generally translate into increased flows and market-making opportunities\" for banks' trading desks, Moody's wrote in a note on Friday.</p><p>A wild card is commodity trading, typically one of the less-transparent components of Wall Street revenue. While banks can end up with negative marks if their desks or clients were positioned against the huge surges in oil or gas prices, Autonomous analysts anticipate that banks can on net benefit as \"commodity players seek capital and intermediation services to navigate price volatility.\" Notably, nickel giant Tsingshan Holding Group faced margin calls, but JPMorgan Chase and other banks also helped negotiate new lending for the producer, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>The first quarter also needs to be considered in the context of what has happened since the pandemic began. For both of the past two years, the five biggest global Wall Street banks -- Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley -- generated over $100 billion in collective annual trading revenue, according to KBW analysts. That is about one-third better than what they did in 2019.</p><p>Trying to bet on trading results is much like trading itself, which is to say that most investors probably shouldn't do it. Another hard-to-predict component is how much balance sheet banks allocate to trading, which helps drive how much revenue they can wring from whatever is going on. With banks' sizes already stretched, they might not be able to lean in as aggressively as in the recent past.</p><p>But shares of the big five Wall Street banks are all already underperforming the KBW Nasdaq Bank index this year. With rapidly rising interest rates and accelerating loan growth set to benefit banks overall, a positive surprise in first-quarter trading revenue may be just the spark bank shares need.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
