  "text": "<p>How nice to read Martin Wolf's typically low-key excoriation of modern banking (“Competitiveness' mantra must not let risky banking rise again,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b2dfce8-0013-4b38-afbf-c453b71bea8b\">Opinion</a>, December 3), then to turn the page to learn that UniCredit's chief executive's main motivation is greed: he wants as much money as Jamie Dimon, who earned $34.5mn last year (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cee600a-2c98-4a9c-afc1-cd6384f7303b\">Report</a>, December 3). </p> <p>Apparently Andrea Orcel is “a star investment banker”, which means that he is, or was, very good at something that Wolf correctly describes as “of no evident value to the public”. This is crony capitalism at its worse. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Anderson</strong><br><em>Edinburgh, UK</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: An excoriating article about crony capitalism' FT.com 6 December.
