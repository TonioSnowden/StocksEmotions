  "title": "Yields Rise As Data Stir Fear of Inflation",
  "text": "<p>European sovereign bond yields also climbed, with the yield on the 10-year German bund rising to minus 0.178%, the highest since March 2020.</p><p>Much of the climb came after data showed that the U.S. economy expanded 6.4% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, leaving the world's largest economy within 1% of its late 2019 peak. Households, boosted by recent stimulus efforts, ramped up spending on everything from cars to furniture.</p><p>Investors tend to sell government bonds when they expect growth and inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed payments and can spur the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Yields have climbed steadily this year, reaching nearly 1.75% at the end of the first quarter from around 0.9% at the close of 2020, lifted by expectations for reopenings and stimulus to fuel a surge in growth.</p><p>President Biden's Wednesday night proposal for another round of fiscal stimulus spending, which could total $1.8 trillion, also weighed on the bond market.</p><p>\"The fiscal stimulus has been the single more important factor for the bond market this year. It's delivered a huge boost to growth and really changed perception of where the U.S. economy is going, where the Treasury market is going,\" said Seamus Mac Gorain, head of global rates at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. It remains to be seen if the latest proposed package gets passed by Congress, but it would be another contributor to growth, he said.</p><p>Some observers have spent months debating whether that acceleration will prompt the Fed to pare easy-money policies more quickly than expected. The 10-year yield on Thursday pared an early climb to finish little changed after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy remains a long way from the central bank's goals and officials would need to see substantial further progress before reducing support for the economy.</p><p>\"The bond market is trying to draw inferences around when we can expect the tapering debate to be meaningful. It's looking increasingly likely by June,\" said Chris Jeffery, head of rates and inflation strategy at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. \"The Fed has repeatedly said they need to see some substantial progress. I think we should expect to see this imminently.\"</p><p>The improving U.S. outlook also has lifted European government bond yields, challenging the region, which hasn't recovered as strongly. Several major economies, including Germany and France, remain in lockdowns, although vaccination rollouts are speeding up.</p>",
