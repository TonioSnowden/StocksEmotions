  "title": "Fed's Quarles sees ‘significant upside risk' to inflation outlook",
  "text": "<p>In a speech to the 2021 Milken Institute Global Conference, Quarles said he is beginning to focus more of his attention on whether inflation will drop back down towards the Fed's 2% target than on the labor market, which he said was “rapidly improving.”</p><p>Quarles is the third Fed governor to make remarks in the past two weeks that lean in the direction of the need to tighten monetary policy.</p><p>The Fed's favorite measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure index, rose at a 4.3% annual rate in August, more than double the 2% rate that the central bank has targeted.</p><p>Quarles noted that most forecasters and he and most of his colleagues on the Fed's interest rate committee, expect inflation to begin its descent toward 2% over the next year.</p><p>The fundamental dilemma that the Fed faces is that demand, boosted by fiscal spending, has outstripped a temporarily disrupted supply, which is leading to higher inflation. But trying to curtail demand to bring down inflation “would be premature,” he said.</p><p>Still, risks of higher inflation lie in the fact that supply constraints have already lasted longer than forecasters anticipated and “there is evidence in the past couple of months that a broader range of prices are beginning to increase at moderate rates,” Quarles said.</p><p>“Transitory does not necessarily mean ‘short-lived',” he said.</p><p>The Fed governor said he doesn't think the Fed is behind the curve on inflation and that conditions for raising interest rates have not been met.</p><p>But questions of how high inflation is too high and how long the Fed will tolerate high inflation are now relevant, he said.</p><p>In the near term, Quarles said he will support a decision at the Fed's meeting in two weeks to begin to slow down the Fed's $120 billion per month in asset purchases and end the quantitative easing by the middle of next year.</p><p>Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P Morgan Chase&amp; Co, said a November taper announcement is “now mostly a formality.”</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y has risen steadily from close to 1.3% level at the last FOMC meeting in late September and is now above 1.6%.</p><p>Earlier this month, Quarles' term as Fed Vice Chair for banking supervision expired. The post has yet to be filled by the Biden Administration. Quarles' term as a Fed governor doesn't expire until 2032.</p>",
