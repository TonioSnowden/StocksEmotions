  "text": "<p>\"We'll see certainly in the short run adjustments in prices,\" said Rob Vos, an economist at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \"I would be very cautious in making big projections that things are stabilizing and getting better because we still are in a pretty difficult and tight situation.\"</p><p>Supply problems caused by the pandemic sent the price of food soaring last year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February added additional pressure.</p><p>The two countries combined accounted for 28% of global wheat exports last year and 15% of corn exports. Russia is also a major exporter of agricultural fertilizer, and Ukraine leads the world in sunflower oil exports.</p><p>The onset of the war pushed up global food prices by 13% in March from the previous month, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.</p><p>Prices have edged down since, and in June, they were about 3% below March levels, though they remain higher than before the war started, according to the FAO.</p><p>Futures markets point to continued price declines. Wheat-futures prices are roughly where they were before Feb. 24, when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. Corn prices are at their lowest level so far this year.</p><p>A recent agreement between Russia and Ukraine allowing exports of Ukrainian wheat could help cool global prices.</p><p>After the deal was signed, Russia attacked two of Ukraine's biggest ports, raising doubts about Moscow's adherence to the pact.</p><p>The recent decline in commodity prices has started to show up in consumer prices in some countries, and economists expect further moderation in coming months.</p><p>Annual food inflation in Colombia has eased from its peak in April, even though it remains historically high, according to government statistics.</p><p>In Egypt, food prices fell on a monthly basis in June, the government reported.</p><p>In the U.S., Wingstop Inc., a restaurant chain, said it has started seeing falling chicken prices.</p><p>\"We are benefiting from meaningful deflation in bone-in wings,\" said Chief Executive Officer Michael Skipworth in an earnings call.</p><p>J.P. Morgan economists forecast global food inflation rates falling by half to around 5.5% or 6% in the fourth quarter of this year from about 13% in the second quarter.</p><p>That would make a big difference in emerging markets, where food accounts for a greater share of consumer spending than in developed economies. Easing food inflation could bring inflation down by 1.5 percentage points globally and 2 percentage points in emerging markets, J.P. Morgan estimates. That could take some pressure off central banks, many of which have been raising interest rates to bring inflation under control.</p><p>The U.S. also could see food prices moderate. Agricultural economists, though, say the effect at U.S. grocery stores could be muted.</p><p>Commodities contribute only about 15% of retail food costs, with labor, shipping, packaging, advertising and profit margins contributing the rest, said Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University.</p><p>Lower commodity prices \"certainly can't hurt,\" he said. \"From the consumers' perspective it's a positive sign that maybe we'll see some downward pressure or at least a reduction in the increase.\"</p><p>U.S. consumer food prices, both at grocery stores and restaurants, were up 10.4% in June from the previous year, the highest in more than four decades, according to the Labor Department. Food inflation accounted for about 1.4 percentage points of the 9.1% overall inflation rate in June, said the Labor Department.</p><p>Higher prices are prompting some consumers to pull back or switch to cheaper brands.</p>",
