  "text": "<p>Software stocks have taken a pounding as the new year has arrived, with analysts from JP Morgan among those loudly suggesting that large gains in recent years have led to the stocks reaching proper valuations when compared with growth expected in the near future. Both the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY — which follows Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, stocks — and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV are down about 10% in the past three months, and are now only showing low single-digit percentage gains in the past 12 months.</p><p>For more: Salesforce, Adobe lead software selloff amid growth concerns</p><p>In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 6% over the past three months, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP is up 2%, and over the past 12 months the S&amp;P 500 is up 23% and the Nasdaq is up 14%.</p><p>Other analysts have followed the declines by offering their silver linings in the cloud decline — software stocks for investors to target. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a recent note that while valuations are stretched in the software sector, fundamentals are “still alive.” While the IGV only gained 12% to the S&amp;P 500's 27% rise in 2021, that follows the software ETF's 52% surge in 2020 compared with the S&amp;P 500's 16% gain.</p><p>“Multiples will continue to compress in '22 as digital digestion happens post pandemic and 80% of Software names are expected to decelerate (vs. 43% in 2021 and 66% in 2020),” Thill said. “We expect the IGV to outperform S&amp;P 500 in '22 driven by strong fundamentals after underperforming in '21.”</p><p>Top picks from Jefferies include Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Adobe Inc. ADBE, Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, Inuit Inc. INTU, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD, and SailPoint Technologies Holdings Inc. SAIL</p><p>RBC Capital Markets, in a note headed by analyst Matthew Hedberg, said it doesn't expect the trend of more experiences becoming “digitally connected” to slow down.</p><p>“Our fundamental thesis remains unchanged that 2020/21 seismically changed the technology landscape in a way that will largely shape the next decade of tech trends and push every organization ‘Faster to the Future,'” according to RBC.</p><p>“While initial COVID/[work-from-home] tailwinds begin to fade and the sector faces more challenging comps, we look to the durability of software trends that will persist over the next year (and decade) with a focus on cloud, hybrid-work, automation, AI and security transformations,” Hedberg said.</p><p>See also: These tech stocks have fallen as much as 51%. Should you consider buying now?</p><p>That durability outweighs the “November/December sell down as fears of the Omicron COVID variant, slowing COVID/WFH tailwinds, interest rate fears, difficult comps, sector rotations, FX headwinds, margin pressure (from labor shortages and some COVID-related cost savings fading), and overall valuation fears” weigh on the sector, according to RBC.</p><p>RBC counts such stocks as Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, ServiceNow Inc. NOW, Twilio Inc. TWLO, Veeva Systems Inc. VEEV and Coursera Inc. COUR as among its top picks for 2022.</p><p>Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi said it's unsurprising that SaaS stocks have “languished” because of expected interest rate hikes, and that sets up an ideal buy opportunity.</p><p>“We submit that this underperformance makes promising SaaS stocks appear more compelling after the group's valuation has fallen below its two-year rolling average support level, a dynamic not seen since March 2020 after COVID-19's initial shock,” Panigrahi said.</p><p>Top picks at Mizuho include Palo Alto Networks, Atlassian Corp. TEAM, Intuit, Twilio and Autodesk Inc. ADSK</p><p>Not so fast, ‘skinny' earnings beats pose a problem</p><p>UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, however, has a more cautious view on the sector, given what he called a “pattern of skinny 3Q beats” in earnings reports, and accordingly downgraded Salesforce and Adobe to hold ratings.</p><p>Keirstead said he spoke with more than 25 large enterprise IT execs on their spending outlooks for 2022 and came away from that with concerns that “'front-office' spending growth may moderate in 2022.”</p><p>While Keirstead said much of the selloff could be connected to inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates, “we're far more interested in the risk that a slower pace of enterprise spending – the key fundamental risk – may at least partly explain the uninspiring results across the software sector in recent months and that this risk continues to weigh on the sector in 4Q21 and potentially for at least several more quarters.”</p><p>From his talks with IT execs, Keirstead said beneficiaries in 2022 appear to include companies such as Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc's AMZN AWS public cloud service, MongoDB Inc. MDB, and Snowflake Inc. SNOW</p><p>Of the stocks covered in this report, Microsoft, Intuit, and Palo Alto Networks all have gained more than 40% over the past 12 months, while shares of Twilio, Veeva, CrowdStrike, SailPoint, and Autodesk have lagged 15% or more.</p>",
