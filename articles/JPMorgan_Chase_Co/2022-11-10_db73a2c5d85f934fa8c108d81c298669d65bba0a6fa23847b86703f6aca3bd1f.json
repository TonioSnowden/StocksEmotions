  "title": "Business News: Carvana's Bonds Crater After Results Disappoint Investors",
  "text": "<p>The used-car business thrived when people opted to drive to avoid mass transportation during the pandemic. But car prices have dropped as interest rates went up and concerns over a recession grew, denting the company's growth prospects. The company, which promised to reinvent the business of selling used cars, has never turned a profit and has borrowed money to cover its losses.</p><p>The bonds had already dropped this year as the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates in March. But they slid around 25% after Carvana's latest earnings report on Friday, indicating that investors have become more pessimistic about the company's fundamentals, rather than following broader market moves.</p><p>Carvana's stock is down almost 50% since the company announced its quarterly results last week, which disappointed investors after the company said it incurred a net loss of $508 million over the three months ended Sept. 30 amid declining revenue and rising costs. It also announced that its cash balance dropped by $731 million over the last quarter, ending at $316 million as of Sept. 30.</p><p>However, Carvana also reported around $4.4 billion in available liquidity, including the $316 million of cash on hand, $2 billion through a revolving line of credit and $2 billion available through financing arrangements tied to real estate it owns. That compared with about $4.75 billion of total liquidity as of June 30, as the decline in cash was partially offset by an increase in revolver availability.</p><p>A Carvana spokesperson said Wednesday that its cash balance at the end of the quarter was in line with its historical levels of an average of $350 million at year-end for the past two years.</p><p>The cash position \"reflects our consistent practice of paying down revolving liabilities with excess cash,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>But the $731 million drop in its available cash in the third quarter has led bankers, investors and analysts to focus on how Carvana can generate liquidity from its real-estate assets to fund operating losses.</p><p>Seth Basham, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that Carvana could likely generate $500 million to $1 billion in cash over the next six months through monetizing its real estate by obtaining mortgages or conducting sale leasebacks, or both.</p><p>Mr. Basham said that his biggest concern about Carvana is whether the company will be able to cut costs and stabilize revenues to satisfy its continuing interest burden.</p><p>Carvana may be able to ride out a recession with its liquidity resources, analysts from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. wrote in a report published Tuesday. But they said the direction of the business fundamentals drove the analysts to cut their estimates for earnings and free cash flow.</p><p>\"We believe Carvana is far from out of the woods,\" the JPMorgan analysts wrote. \"Even when the industry bottoms out, we don't see a V-shaped recovery.\"</p><p>Equity investors pushed Carvana stock as high as $360 last year. Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas changed his rating on Carvana, setting a new price target of $1.</p><p>---</p><p>Soma Biswas ontributed to this article.</p>",
