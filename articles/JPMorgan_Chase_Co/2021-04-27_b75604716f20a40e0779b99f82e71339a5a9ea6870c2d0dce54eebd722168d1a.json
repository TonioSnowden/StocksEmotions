  "text": "<p>0537 GMT - Cathay Pacific Airways could get a boost after the Hong Kong-Singapore air travel bubble opens up on May 26, Jefferies says. The initial impact may be incrementally positive, however, as there are only plans to have one daily two-way flight at first, Jefferies notes. That will increase to two daily flights from June 10. Air cargo should remain Cathay 's key tailwind, with yields already showing signs of recovery, the U.S. investment bank says. Cargo yields from Hong Kong to U.S. have risen 68% since end-March. The bank maintains a buy rating and target price of HK$8.60 on Cathay 's shares, which are trading 0.1% higher at HK$7.08. (yiwei.wong@wsj.com)</p><p>0214 GMT - Container line SITC International's revenue growth is likely to be driven by higher contributions from its container shipping business during a tighter small-vessel supply, Daiwa Capital says. Congestion at ports and crew changes caused by the Covid-19 pandemic are also likely to continue and support high freight rates for SITC. \"We are relatively positive on the trading activity outlook and prefer SITC's high APAC market presence and small vessel fleet,\" Daiwa says. The investment bank raises its target price to HK$34 from HK$29 and maintains a buy rating. Shares are 3.4% higher at HK$30.10. (justina.lee@wsj.com)</p><p>1850 GMT - Freight forwarder KÃ¼hne + Nagel International says it shipped 50M Covid-19 vaccines during 1Q and expects that to rise up to seven-fold in the current quarter. CEO Detlef Trefzger says on an investor call that there's been no shipping bottlenecks, with production the pacing factor. US plans to send AstraZeneca -made vaccine stocks overseas should boost the volume shipped by air, with Lufthansa among those who've previously expected to be involved in the US export market. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)</p><p>1616 GMT - European stocks gain as the US corporate earnings focus switches to the tech sector and car-maker Tesla. The Stoxx Europe 600, FTSE 100 and CAC 40 each rise 0.3% and the DAX gains 0.1%. The price of a barrel of Brent crude pares earlier losses of nearly 3% to stand 1.6% lower at $65.03. The Dow industrials edge 0.07% higher. \"Markets remain quiet ahead of Tesla earnings tonight, which mark the shift to reports from a vital part of the market--the big tech names,\" says Chris Beauchamp at IG. \"Elsewhere, a weaker set of durable goods orders, reflecting weakness in aircraft orders and the shortage of computer chips, dimmed optimism to an extent.\" (philip.waller@wsj.com)</p><p>1559 GMT - The news around Canadian National Railway of late has centered on the railroad's bid for Kansas City Southern , which said Saturday Canadian National's offer for it could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal as defined by its merger deal with Canadian Pacific Railway . For 1Q, and with the rail network Canadian National has now, the company is expected to report C$1.24 a share in profit on C$3.57B in revenue, or 99 cents a share on $2.86B, better than a year earlier, according to FactSet. Volumes and revenue per each ton-mille are anticipated to be up compared with last year's pandemic-hampered results but down a bit from 4Q last year. Canadian National shares trading in New York are up 0.3% near midday; the company is scheduled to report results after the market closes. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)</p><p>1427 GMT - American Airlines ' myriad debt issues all get an upgrade to buy by CreditSights in a sign of how investor sentiment is warming towards the world's largest airline. Spreads and CDS pricing are narrowing compared with Delta and United, which now face their own aircraft-related capex bills. American's cash generation has helped the debate move on to where it's deployed, beyond servicing the $24B debt pile, and it now has what JPMorgan styles as a $11B \"security blanket\" of unencumbered assets. Shares top the sector with a 3.1% gain. (doug.cameron@wsj.com; @dougcameron)</p><p>1334 GMT - An unusual jump on used-car prices is likely to \"add just above 0.3%\" to core inflation over the next three months, Pantheon Macroeconomic estimates, adding that \"this will not alone change the overall core inflation picture, but it will augment the upward pressure we expect...as the economy reopens.\" The research firm refers to data showing that auction prices jumped 52.1% by mid-April over a year earlier, while before the pandemic used vehicle prices rose about 5% a year. Pantheon says that \"what happens at auction usually finds its way into the CPI with a lag of a few months.\" (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)</p><p>1104 GMT - European airlines' first-quarter results will be no different from the previous quarters with hefty losses and very weak travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, Bernstein says. \"While liquidity poses no immediate threat, all airlines will continue to suffer through painful losses,\" the brokerage says. The second quarter is unlikely to bring much relief for Air France-KLM , Lufthansa and IAG --the three largest network carriers in the region-- either, with recovery potentially delayed until 2022 if European countries don't make sufficient progress on their vaccination campaigns this year, Bernstein says. (olivia.bugault@wsj.com)</p><p>0953 GMT - European stocks trade mixed as traders eye corporate earnings and economic news in the week ahead. The Stoxx Europe 600 and DAX trade broadly flat, the CAC 40 is up 0.1% and the FTSE 100 drops 0.1%. The price of a barrel of Brent crude declines 2.8% to $64.25. \"While corporate results are still likely to be the main focus for investors, especially with earnings from tech giants Apple and Facebook as well as Tesla looming this week, traders will also keep an eye on the Fed's next move,\" says ActivTrades analyst Pierre Veyret, though he adds no significant change in monetary policy is expected Wednesday. (philip.waller@wsj.com)</p><p>0926 GMT - Kuehne + Nagel 's good momentum should continue in the second quarter which could trigger an upgrade to consensus for the full year, Citi says. The Swiss logistics company's first-quarter adjusted EBIT came in at CHF431 million, far above expectations of CHF304 million, the bank says. \"The strong beat is mainly driven by the pricing (yield) performance in sea and volume growth in air logistics,\" it says. Kuehne + Nagel trades 1.6% higher at CHF297.10. (olivia.bugault@wsj.com)</p><p>0907 GMT - First-quarter revenue for tire maker Michelin should come in higher compared with the same three months a year earlier, says Equita analyst Martino De Ambroggi. While Equita estimates revenue to be up 4% to EUR5.52 billion, company-compiled consensus sees sales up 3% year-on-year, says the analyst. Equita also expects the French company to back its guidance for the full year, which includes segment operating income of more than EUR2.5 billion at constant exchange rates. Shares in Michelin--scheduled to report after markets close today--trade 0.3% down at EUR126.70. (kim.richters@wsj.com)</p><p>Auto &amp; Transport Roundup: Market Talk</p>",
