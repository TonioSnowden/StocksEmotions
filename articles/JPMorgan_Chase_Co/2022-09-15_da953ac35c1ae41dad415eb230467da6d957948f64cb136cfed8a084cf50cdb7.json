  "title": "Some 90% of world's biggest companies will be exposed to a degree of climate-change risk, fresh data shows; At least 10% of the S&P 500's total assets would be hit by climate hazards by the 2050s under a business-as-usual scenario. S&P Global's new data tool reveals",
  "text": "<p>These figures are among the leading takeaways unearthed in new data out Thursday from a unit of S&amp;P Global. The findings, and an accompanying tool meant to gauge these risks, are part of S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 and are guided by The Climate Service, which S&amp;P bought earlier this year.</p><p>It's also becoming clearer that the stock market will be directly impacted by climate change. Close to 10% of the S&amp;P 500'sSPX total assets would be financially impacted by climate hazards by the 2050s under a business-as-usual scenario. Water stress and extreme heat will have the highest impact, the data tool shows.</p><p>\"More than ever, investors and companies are seeking advanced analytics to respond to the financial impact of climate change,\" said James McMahon, chief executive of The Climate Service.</p><p>The tool is meant to help clients get a handle on the \"future financial costs of changing hazard exposure for 20,000 companies, down to the rooftop level,\" he said.</p><p>The business push for S&amp;P also marks increasing awareness that companies and their investors will need everpresent and timely data as climate change evolves, particularly if the SEC continues to move forward with landmark regulation that will require more climate data transparency. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.JPM, Fitch Ratings and Morningstar Inc.MORN all released similar products this year.</p><p>Read: Toomey tells SEC chief to be 'on notice' that Supreme Court may overrule new climate rule</p><p>The S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 product looks at over 870,000 corporate assets such as warehouses and data centers.</p><p>It finds that 98% of companies will feel some level of impact by the 2090s under a business-as-usual scenario. And more than 70% of S&amp;P Global 1200 companies in the Utilities, Energy and Materials sectors have at least one asset where the physical risks of climate change are equivalent to 20% or more of that asset's value under the business-as-usual scenario.</p><p>And, if government leaders and the private sector act to tame emissions, the share of large companies with assets at high physical risk could be reduced to 39% by the 2090s (20% reduction) under an emissions scenario consistent with limiting global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius.</p><p>The planet already 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than before the industrial age. Scientists estimate that several critical planetary systems are at risk of tipping beyond the point of no return, such as Arctic thawing that can raise ocean levels, even if nations curb warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower threshold set in the voluntary Paris Agreement.</p><p>Read: Scale up the climate-change response now or expect drought and heat to get worse, meteorological group warns</p><p>Some 90% of world's biggest companies will be exposed to a degree of climate-change risk, fresh data shows</p>",
