  "text": "<p>Don't call it a comeback (no, seriously don't), but Cathie Wood's ARK Investment complex is making a solid showing this week, with three of her exchange-traded funds breaking into our list of Top 5 best performers for the week. Ark Innovation ETF and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF were both up more than 6%, while Wood's fintech fund was pulling up the rear, with a more than 5% weekly gain (Check out our weekly moves table).</p><p>All three of those funds are saddled with sizable month-to-date losses of at least 6%, so there is a lot of ground to recovery before those funds dig out their holes. Ark InnovationARKK, Wood's flagship fund, is up about 5% for the week, but missed our Top 5 list.</p><p>Barron's, MarketWatch's sister publication,&#xa0;named Wood one of the &#xa0;100 Most Influential Women in U.S. Finance in 2021, and, of course, it has been tough sledding for her ever since.</p><p>Momentum shift in MTUM</p><p>Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, tells us that iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum&#xa0;ETF MTUM rebalancing this week, part of a three-day rebalance, is a big deal. He says that 41% of the assets in the ETF had been in the technology sector, with a hefty smattering in consumer discretionary shares but that is about to change, with financials and other value names gathering steam. Financials are essentially the new momentum play.</p><p>Financials, including JPMorgan Chase JPM, Bank of America BAC and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. WFC are 18% of that ETF's weighting and tech is down to 28%.</p><p>Weekly ETF moves</p><p> Top 5 gainers of the past week          % Performance  Ark Innovation ETF ARKK                 6.2  Ark Next Generation Internet ETF ARKW   6.2  Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI  5.5  Global X FinTech ETF FINX               5.4  ARK Fintech Innovation ETF ARKF         5.3  Source: FactSet, through Wednesday, May 26, excluding ETNs and leveraged products.&#xa0;Includes NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe traded ETFs of $500 million or greater</p><p> Top 5 decliners of the past week                        % Performance  Global X Copper Miners ETF COPX                         -3.3  iShares MSCI Global Metals &amp; Mining Producers ETF PICK  -2.8  VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIH                     -2.3  SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF KRE                       -1.9  Global X Uranium ETF URA                                -1.9</p><p>Another bitcoin ETF application?</p><p>There are a number of companies trying to get regulatory approval for a bitcoin BTCUSD exchange-traded fund.
