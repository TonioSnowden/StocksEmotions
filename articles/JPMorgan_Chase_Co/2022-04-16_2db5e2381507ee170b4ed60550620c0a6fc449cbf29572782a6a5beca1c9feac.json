  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Brown-Forman Revamps Tech Leadership  ----  By Suman Bhattacharyya",
  "text": "<p>   Jack Daniel's whiskey maker Brown-Forman Corp. in March restructured its technology leadership around the supply chain, which its chief financial officer has identified as a source of pressure. </p><p>   For Brown-Forman, glass-supply pressures were the largest driver of supply-chain disruption, Leanne Cunningham, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in its third-quarter earnings call last month. The Louisville, Ky.-based company is facing cost pressures from rising commodity prices, including agave and grain, she noted. </p><p>   \"Our cost increases have been driven by our efforts to minimize the impact of the supply chain disruptions largely related to the glass supply constraints,\" Ms. Cunningham said during the call. </p><p>   Tim Nall, the company's former chief information officer, was promoted March 2 to senior vice president, chief global supply chain and technology officer. He reports to Chief Executive Officer Lawson Whiting. On March 16, the company named Dan Muraski as CIO. </p><p>   Mr. Muraski, a company veteran of more than 12 years, said he plans to focus on supply-chain efficiency, as well as data-analytics capabilities. \"We can better inform our supply chain with better planning, so to me that is probably the number one place where technology can play a role,\" Mr. Muraski said. \"There are probably things we could do to our processes around planning and ordering that we could do better.\" </p><p>   Sailaja Kotra-Turner was named the company's first chief information security officer on March 16. She reports to Mr. Nall. Ms. Kotra-Turner joined the company in September 2020 as global director of information-technology security and governance. </p><p>   Glass-supply shortages affected the beverage industry as demand increased during the pandemic, said Andrea Teixeira, a J.P. Morgan senior equity research analyst. </p><p></p>",
