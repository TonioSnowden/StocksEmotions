A data release on Tuesday showed that consumer prices accelerated further in March, rising 8.5% from a year earlier. The monthly increase was in line with economists' expectations and core inflation which excludes food and energy was slightly lower than predicted, according to Deutsche Bank.</p><p>\"The inflation data was obviously not great, but maybe we're around the peak and we'll start to see something of a disinflationary trend over the coming months,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank. \"With bank earnings kicking off, we can get some direction. It's really going to be about the guidance that we get for the rest of the year.\"</p><p>The U.S. producer price index, another gauge of inflation, rose by 11.2% in March compared with a year ago, coming in above expectations.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.693% from 2.724% on Tuesday, extending its decline into a second day.

British supermarket chain Tesco declined 4.4% after it said it expects lower profit as rising prices change shoppers' habits.</p><p>European government bonds sold off with the benchmark German 10-year bond yield rising to 0.859% before easing moderately. The European Central Bank is meeting Thursday and investors are awaiting more clarity on plans to curb stimulus measures.</p><p>\"ECB speakers have turned a little bit more hawkish lately,\" said Jeremy Gatto, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion. \"They seem now to be agreeing that inflation might be a concern. It's difficult to get excited about Europe.\"</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that peace talks had reached a dead end and that his forces would continue their offensive in Ukraine.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ticked up 0.3%.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.9%. The yen depreciated 0.4% against the dollar, reaching a 20-year low.
