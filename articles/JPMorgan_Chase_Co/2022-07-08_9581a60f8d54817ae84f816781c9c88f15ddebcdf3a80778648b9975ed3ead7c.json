  "text": "<p>\"We think it would be naive to assume there will be no change in advertising budgets as the year rolls on,\" Macquarie Research analysts wrote in a June note.</p><p>As marketers and their business partners brace for the months ahead, here are three things to know on how analysts expect things to pan out.</p><p>A slowdown might not stop at brand advertising</p><p>If there is a broad-based ad slowdown, it will first be seen in brand advertising, the kind of marketing generally designed to achieve goals like generating awareness or improving perceptions, some analysts say.</p><p>In past recessions, marketers cut back on ad spending as a share of gross domestic product and shifted budgets to more \"efficient and measurable mediums like digital and away from traditional categories like print and radio,\" MoffettNathanson analysts wrote in a May research note.</p><p>\"We believe platforms that are focused on performance advertising and can prove ROI will be more resilient than those focused on hard-to-measure brand-building capabilities,\" they said, referring to the return on investment for ad spending.</p><p>That would mean that Twitter, which gets about 85% of its ad revenue from brand advertising, might be more exposed than Google, whose search ads show more immediately measurable results in the form of clicks.</p><p>But while marketers under pressure might opt for ad spending more purely focused on ROI, that strategy could create pain over time because it can neglect finding new customers.</p><p>Some brands, singed by inflationary prices on top of supply-chain snarls, are focusing on their business with repeat customers at the expense of attracting new ones, said Nick Drabicky, a senior vice president and general manager of client services at January Digital, a strategic consulting and digital media firm.</p><p>\"But it can give way to short-term gains, versus long-term erosion,\" he added.</p><p>And some analysts suggest all ad budgets will eventually be hit.</p><p>\"Our industry conversations suggest softer near-term trends, particularly within brand spending, but we believe direct response is not far behind,\" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a June note.</p><p>Small businesses might be more resilient spenders—for now</p><p>It might seem intuitive that macroeconomic pressures hit small and medium-size businesses hardest. But RBC Capital Markets said its research on agencies that focus on those clients showed the inverse appears to be true—at least at present.</p><p>In a note last week, RBC analysts said only about a quarter of small and medium-size businesses in their research had cut ad spending, while larger companies appear to be suggesting steeper, more proactive cuts.</p><p>But that initial dynamic might not last. Though small and medium-size companies have been major drivers of online advertising, they may be less able to navigate economic headwinds than the largest corporations, MoffettNathanson analysts wrote.</p><p>The proliferation of small businesses advertising on digital platforms appeared to be moderating, the analysts said, citing the number of those businesses spending on Facebook.</p><p>\"It appears that active advertiser growth on Facebook, and likely for the digital advertising industry broadly, has slowed from the rapid increases in 2020,\" MoffettNathanson analysts wrote.</p><p>... But pandemic-era ad growth was probably not sustainable anyway</p><p>The hyper-growth in digital advertising during the pandemic may soon be a thing of the past. MoffettNathanson analysts said they were concerned over longer-term growth in the segment.</p><p>\"Advertising growth since the pandemic has been primarily fueled by the long tail of SMBs [small and medium-size businesses] which are spending a record share of revenues on advertising,\" they said. \"We believe this has been fueled by Covid-related savings on travel and entertainment, real estate and other corporate expenses which have driven margin expansion especially over the past year.\"</p><p>But the analysts didn't see those ad increases continuing, especially if profit margins are shaved by inflation and corporate expenses, like travel and real estate, as the economy reopens.</p><p>The tailwinds that sent digital advertising rocketing in the pandemic—the rising penetration of e-commerce and growth of small business—appear to be falling back to pre-Covid levels.</p><p>That is not to say that business is headed back to the pre-coronavirus world. By forcing people to spend more time at home, the pandemic pushed forward a lasting shift in the way ads are bought and seen. And marketers are spending bigger chunks of their budgets online to reach consumers where they are.</p><p>\"A slowdown is coming, but I do think that shift in consumer behavior is absolutely permanent,\" Mr. Drabicky said.</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>Three Things Marketers Should Know About Ad Spending Trends</p>",
