  "text": "<p>UBS reported a 24 per cent fall in net profit as its rich clients held back from turbulent markets and investment banking revenues shrank.</p> <p>The world's biggest wealth manager generated $1.7bn of net profit in the third quarter, ahead of analyst estimates of $1.5bn, on $8.2bn of revenue.</p> <p>“Clients remain concerned about persistently high inflation, elevated energy prices, the war in Ukraine and residual effects of the pandemic,” said chief executive Ralph Hamers.</p> <p>“In Switzerland, many of our retail and small business clients will also be impacted by disruptions across the rest of Europe, and we are focused on supporting them through the energy crisis.”</p> <p>Analysts had predicted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7b9542ed-b868-4ee5-9006-f0c2b74a010a\">UBS</a> would be the strongest European bank in the third quarter thanks to its wealth management business benefiting from rising interest rates, but that its performance would be offset by its risk-averse clients making fewer transactions and a sharp fall in investment banking revenues.</p> <p>Net interest income in the Americas wealth business shot up 38 per cent compared with a year earlier on the back of a rise in US interest rates. </p> <p>Its cost-income ratio rose 3.1 percentage points to 71.8 per cent, though still within its target range of 70 to 73 per cent.</p> <p>“Third-quarter results are slightly better than expected, but continue to show a difficult environment for UBS, with pressure on revenues,” said Jefferies analyst Flora Bocahut.</p> <p>UBS shares rose 5 per cent on Tuesday morning, having dropped 6.7 per cent this year.</p> <p>Hamers has been given the target by his chair, Colm Kelleher, of raising UBS's stock market valuation to close the gap with its US peers. UBS trades at a price to book ratio of 0.9, compared with JPMorgan's 1.4.</p> <p>Hamers and Kelleher have been courting large US investment managers this year, trying to convince them to buy big stakes in the bank. Last month UBS announced it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/808d6807-a63a-4d51-8a87-2df8188515b9\">raise its dividend</a> by 10 per cent and exceed its goal of buying back $5bn of shares this year.</p> <p>UBS also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50e6b683-7d51-4746-b7e8-707bf9bb01e6\">abandoned a $1.4bn takeover</a> of US advisory business Wealthfront, a deal that had been championed by Hamers but proved unpopular with investors.</p> <p>The five biggest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-banks\">US banks</a> reported $32bn of investment banking revenues for the third quarter this month, down 16 per cent compared with a year earlier. </p> <p>Fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues (FICC) for the US banks rose 23 per cent over the same period, while equities revenues were down 13 per cent and advisory revenues were down 54 per cent.</p> <p>Based on those figures, analysts at Citigroup predicted European investment banking revenues would be down 33 per cent, FICC up 3 per cent, equities down 26 per cent and advisory down 72 per cent. </p> <p>UBS investment banking revenues dropped 19 per cent to $2bn, with revenues at the group's global banking division, which includes its advisory and capital markets business, decreasing 58 per cent.</p> <p>However, global markets revenues were down just 1 per cent to $1.7bn as a 19 per cent fall in equities income was offset by a 64 per cent rise in foreign exchange, rates and credit revenues.</p><p>Source: Owen Walker, European Banking Correspondent 2022 'UBS profits slide as turbulent markets spook rich clients' FT.com 25 October.
