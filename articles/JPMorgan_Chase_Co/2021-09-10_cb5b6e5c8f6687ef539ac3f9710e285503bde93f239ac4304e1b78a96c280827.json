  "text": "<p>The UK economic rebound slowed to a crawl in July as consumers&#xa0;spent less in stores and raw materials shortages held back the construction sector. </p> <p>Output rose 0.1 per cent in July compared with the previous month, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, which is slower than the 1 per cent expansion in June and lower than the 0.6 per cent expansion forecast by economists polled by Reuters. </p> <p>It was the weakest expansion since January, meaning the economy was still about 2.1 per cent smaller than before the first coronavirus restrictions in February 2020. Total growth was lifted by expansion in the production sector, which was boosted by the reopening of an oilfield, while legal services were hit by the end of the stamp duty holiday.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Cineworld</strong> has agreed to pay an initial $170m to shareholders of Regal Cinemas, which the movie theatre operator acquired in 2018. A judgment against Cineworld in May had landed the group with a bill of $255m before interest, but the company argued that it was prohibited from paying using cash reserves under terms of a loan facility. To aid liquidity Cineworld agreed to keep a further $92m in an escrow account, to be paid to the dissenting shareholders no later than the end of March 2022.</p> <p><strong>Fulham Shore</strong>, the owner of the Franco Manca and Real Greek restaurant chains, said sales have accelerated since August. For the three weeks to early September revenue was 29 per cent higher than the equivalent pre-pandemic period, compared with an 8 per cent average increase for the eight weeks to mid August, the company reported. City centre and London West End trading is still down on 2019 levels but has continued to see a week-by-week improvement in footfall and revenues as tourists and office workers return, Fulham Shore added.</p> <p><strong>Gresham House</strong>, the alternative asset manager, revealed a deal to buy Mobeus Equity Partners' venture capital trust for an initial consideration of £24m, with up to a further £12.1m payable based on three-year performance. Gresham launched a share placing to raise around £40m to fund the purchase, as well as to invest in battery storage and solar projects. A placing price of 910p per share was at a 2.2 per cent discount to Thursday's closing value. Separately, Gresham House reported a half-year net profit of £5.2m and assets under management of £4.7bn, up 19 per cent since the start of the year. </p> <p><strong>Argo Blockchain</strong>, the main market-listed crypto mining group, said it has borrowed £18.1m using a portion of its bitcoin holdings as collateral. The short-term loan, which has a maturity date of late October, will be rolled into Argo's outstanding £14m loan from the same lender. Proceeds will be used to fund building of the company's West Texas data centre and meet operating cash flow requirements, Argo said.</p> <p><strong>Oxford Nanopore</strong> on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0d77f75-d619-4b2b-9030-f22bfce4d8f8\">unveiled plans</a> for an initial public listing on the London Stock Exchange that analysts said could value it at about £4bn. The genomics company's DNA sequencing devices have become essential in identifying and tracking the spread of Covid-19 variants around the world, and it said its revenues had risen 22 per cent to £59m in the six months to June, compared to the same period last year.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Nuclear power companies</strong> are facing competition for&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/624e3ac6-ffb0-49ee-959f-e59c27e96c80\">supplies of uranium</a>&#xa0;from financial investors, who are betting on sharply higher prices and demand for the radioactive material used to fuel reactors.</p> <p><strong>SBI Holdings</strong>, the online financial conglomerate, has launched a potentially hostile <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a863d9d-b081-4a9e-99d7-dbcd828aab75\">$1.1bn stakebuilding exercise</a> in Shinsei Bank, whose private-equity rescue by JC Flowers 21 years ago reshaped the Japanese lending landscape.&#xa0;The unsolicited bid, the latest example of Japanese companies breaking a longstanding taboo against hostile offers, could allow SBI to eject Shinsei's current board and force the bank into a series of closer operational alliances in areas such as unsecured loans.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has agreed to acquire the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6a29ac0-1ad4-4414-831d-fda74d2165eb\">owner of the restaurant review guide Zagat</a>. The US bank said it acquired The Infatuation, which in just over a decade has grown from a New York-focused “where to eat” blog into a restaurant and bar review media and event empire, for an undisclosed sum.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Merryn Somerset Webb</strong> <br>With Conservative government tax hikes, the Bank of England's endless money printing and big companies looking beyond profit, investors are getting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4029852-ad8d-420f-b129-4b15b2801410\">a reminder of the high spending and high tax 1970s</a>. Long-term investors should remember the importance of future income&#xa0;and look to the&#xa0;higher-quality end of UK smaller companies, which look pretty inexpensive relative to the rest of the market.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>The world of buy now, pay later credit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0672259-fba0-4256-99c1-af5d3b124377\">is a hive of activity</a> but the regulatory process has yet to start in earnest. When regulators face tougher challenges around dubious crypto investments, BNPL should be the easier bit in terms of making sure the rules keep up with fintech innovation.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'UK growth slows sharply' FT.com 10 September.
