  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Break out the beers and Pringles, even in Asia. Fans there will have their eyes glued to their televisions early on Monday morning for a global sporting spectacle. The European Football Championship concludes this weekend in London. The final between England and Italy should be one of the most-watched sporting events of all time. </p> <p>Chinese companies have noted the interest at home. Television maker Hisense has been joined on the billboards by TikTok, Vivo and Alipay. Meanwhile, neither Facebook, Google nor Amazon appear on the official partners list.</p> <p>But off the pitch, the real tussle this week was between Didi Chuxing and Beijing. The Chinese ride-hailing group became the latest target of a clampdown in China just days after raising $4.4bn in the year's biggest initial public offering.</p> <p>Watchdogs there cited data security worries for the moves. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edeba135-6fea-4aa5-9b9e-a6e0bcdb0058\">Lex thought</a> another reason existed: annoyance at the flood of US initial public offerings by homegrown groups. Two other Chinese companies that listed in New York last month are also being probed by regulators.</p> <p>Beijing's message is being heard loud and clear. LinkDoc, a medical data company backed by Alibaba, cancelled its New York listing on Thursday, a day after closing its order book.</p> <p>All this has taught American investors a lesson. Shares in Didi now trade 20 per cent below the $14 IPO price. None of this is a good look for the Wall Street banks that underwrote the deal.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac18f66-5c9b-4cd0-a4e6-a86f5464ad6e\">Lex noted</a> prudent bankers and bosses would only have launched US IPOs after taking soundings from Chinese officials. They either spoke to the wrong people or the mood changed radically. Either way, the lawsuits from shareholders against Didi have already started flying.&#xa0;</p> <p>The attack on Didi means US banks will see far less fees coming from Chinese listings in the US in the second half of the year. But short-term, investment banking revenues will continue to impress. Chinese listings aside, the market for IPOs shows no sign of losing its sizzle. Companies have raised more than $85bn since the start of the year, a record for the period, according to Refinitiv.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even so, JPMorgan Chase is not sitting still. The US bank is making bets through acquisitions wherever it can. Since the start of 2021, it has struck more than 30 deals, including the £700m purchase of UK wealth manager Nutmeg. The problem, however, is that almost all of these deals have been tiny for a company with a $460bn market cap.&#xa0;</p> <p>They are either hedges, opportunities for knowledge sharing or straight investments. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3599aa54-1491-4958-a370-d751f6a7e5c2\">As Lex said: </a>“They demonstrate why traditional banking has not managed to excite investors, even as the businesses thrive.” Then again, things could be worse. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/710e49e4-b1a1-4771-8263-096d12b1ab2f\">Singapore</a> struggles to attract new listings, Lex pointed out. </p> <p>Jamie Dimon is not the only one on the prowl for deals. Bob Diamond, the former Barclays head, has struck a deal for Circle, the company behind digital currency USD Coin. He plans to merge it with his New York-listed blank cheque company at an enterprise value of $4.5bn. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf17fc53-6668-43ab-9b7e-f3114aefed42\">Lex was sceptical</a>. To hit its lofty financial targets, not only must digital money go mainstream, Circle must emerge as a winner too.</p> <p>Over in the UK, a trio of private investment groups led by SoftBank-owned Fortress this week struck a £9.5bn deal to acquire Wm Morrison, Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain.&#xa0;</p> <p>Supermarkets have notoriously thin margins. But small increments in operating margins and exit prices can yield fat gains for leveraged purchasers. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfa13952-6b97-4711-b754-5d54150ae724\">Lex crunched</a> the numbers. The consortium led by Fortress would buy Morrisons at 8.5 times ebitda. If they sold at a multiple of 9.5 times in a few years, they should achieve a 20 per cent annualised return on a £3bn equity investment.</p> <p>But this is not a done deal. Rival buyout firm Apollo has considered a potential counterbid. Whichever private equity group ends up winning, the victor will pit its style of private ownership against listed chains such as J Sainsbury and Tesco, and the family-controlled German interlopers Aldi and Lidl. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24431d64-5fbe-437b-9ebc-963cc27b0108\">As Lex noted</a>, family groups worry less about short-term targets than quoted businesses. Through aggressive pricing, the German discounters have increased their UK market share to just over 14 per cent.</p> <p>Finally, another global ransomware attack that affected more than 1,000 companies reminds us that cyber crimes grow ever larger, more damaging and pricier. The cost to insure against such attacks is rising.</p> <p>Even so, Lex found that this is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/194de509-c952-47b1-b354-80b46508f575\">hardly juicy business for insurers</a>. Of the top-two standalone cyber security underwriters last year, Axa barely washed its face and AIG dipped into losses. The industry as a whole had a loss ratio of 73 per cent on an aggregate $1.6bn of direct written premiums, according to S&amp;P data.</p> <p>Let's hope hackers prefer watching the football and leave everything alone this weekend. Enjoy yourselves, whatever you do.</p> <p><strong>Pan Kwan Yuk</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: Pan Kwan Yuk 2021 'Best of Lex: Chinese checkers — Beijing clampdown to hit US listings' FT.com 9 July.
