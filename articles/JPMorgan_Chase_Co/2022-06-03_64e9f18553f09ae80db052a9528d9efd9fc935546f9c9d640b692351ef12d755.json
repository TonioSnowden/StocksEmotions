It's a hurricane,” said the <strong>JPMorgan</strong> <strong>Chase</strong> boss at a conference on Wednesday. “That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way. We just don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy . . . And you better brace yourself.”</p> <p>Some of Dimon's competitors were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d740f61b-f9d4-49d8-9bed-209a47d1f535\">quick to poke fun</a>. “We're in North Carolina,” said <strong>Bank of America</strong> head <strong>Brian Moynihan</strong>. “You've got hurricanes that come every year. So, we're always prepared.”</p> <p>“I'm going to try not to use any weather analogies,” quipped <strong>John</strong> <strong>Waldron</strong>, president of <strong>Goldman</strong> <strong>Sachs</strong>.</p> <p>Dimon's alarm was resonant, nonetheless, as financiers navigate geopolitical uncertainty, surging inflation, and a less supportive<strong> Federal Reserve</strong>. </p> <p>“This is among, if not the most complex dynamic environment I've ever seen in my career,” said Waldron. “The confluence of the number of shocks to the system, to me, is unprecedented.”</p> <p>“It's a complicated time because, obviously, the economy was overstimulated,” said <strong>Blackstone</strong> founder <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Schwarzman</strong>. </p> <p>Dimon is on the defensive, not just in cutting JPMorgan's risk, but in warding off outside threats. </p> <p>His comments came in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14fcf2be-067d-49e3-ae6d-814dd6a35abf\">freewheeling talk</a> that touched on his love of capitalism, antipathy for being called “woke” and worry that the next financial blow-up could come from the loosely regulated private capital industry.</p> <p>“I'm not woke. And I think people are mistaking the stakeholder capitalism thing for being woke,” he said. “All we're saying is when we wake up in the morning, what we give a shit about is serving customers, earning their respect, earning their repeat business.”</p> <p>Dimon also said he doesn't care about shareholder votes — except maybe a recent one that rejected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd34c86b-1253-467a-aa83-23a78b81fcb4\">his $50mn compensation package</a>.</p> <p>His message to the “27-year-old compliance officers” that blindly vote on recommendations from proxy advisers such as <strong>ISS,</strong> which advised shareholders to reject his bonus: “do your homework.”</p> <p>Dimon also critiqued the private lenders encroaching on JPMorgan's turf. “There's a lot of leveraged lending out there,” he said. “Will someone get hurt? Probably.”</p> <p>He also acknowledged risks to his own bank.</p> <p>“Twenty years ago our competition was mostly other banks . . . Now, you have very intense shadow banks. Think of <strong>Citadel</strong>, the mortgage brokers, direct lenders, and a lot of payments companies, exchanges and data companies,” he said. “They're skimming off a lot of profit from the financial system.”</p> <p>“I think JPMorgan is in pretty good shape. I think the competition is going to be brutal and fun to watch . . . There'll be a lot of losers in there too, by the way.”</p> <h2>Kanter paints a bleak picture for Big Tech</h2> <p><strong>Jonathan Kanter</strong> is hoping to inspire works of art. </p> <p>That might sound like a strange ambition for the US<strong> Department of Justice</strong>'s antitrust chief, but if the artwork in his office is anything to go by, Kanter has grand designs to curb corporate power.</p> <p>Hanging in Kanter's office is a <a href=\"https://theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record.aspx?libID=o277812\">cartoon</a> of a wrecked airship — emblazoned with the words “High Finance” — drawn by the Welsh-born cartoonist <strong>John Samuel Pughe</strong> in the height of the trustbusting era pioneered by <strong>Theodore Roosevelt</strong>. </p> <p>The sketch features business magnates of early 1900s America pictured as stranded passengers. The splinters feature names of mega trusts and a broken-up corporation, with a black cloud labelled “investigation”, “merger decision” and “law” hovering above in a nod to the cause of the crash.</p> <p>If Kanter has anything to do with it, cartoonists will be drawing similar images more than a century later. </p> <p>“We're seeing that once-in-a-century inflection point in terms of reach of corporate power and popular support for addressing corporate power,” Kanter told the FT's Stefania Palma. A longtime critic of Big Tech, the antitrust boss is part of a new progressive generation of antitrust officials brought in by <strong>Joe Biden</strong>. </p> <p>DD readers will be familiar with Kanter. Last month, we told you about his plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/983b3467-30db-4bf4-a725-45e57176f056\">crack down on private equity deals</a> amid a dealmaking spree by the world's largest buyout groups. &#xa0;</p> <p>Outlining grand plans is one thing, however. Executing them is another. The DoJ has had mixed results under Kanter so far. While the department has secured some guilty pleas and convictions, it has also suffered a couple of notable defeats.</p> <p>Kanter's timing is good, at least. His appointment comes as Big Tech — which he has signalled will be one of his primary focuses —&#xa0;faces a huge backlash. <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>Meta</strong>) and <strong>Google</strong>, in particular, have come under increasing scrutiny for anti-competitive practices. </p> <p>The problem is that fines the companies are typically required to cough up are just a drop in the bucket for these hugely powerful tech behemoths.</p> <p>What Kanter needs are landmark antitrust lawsuits that will shape future case law and that takes time. </p> <p>For any doubters that Kanter means business, there's another work of art in his office that might be appropriate — a picture of Mickey Mouse with a wide smile and a raised middle finger. </p> <h2>The private equity auction for Toshiba is far from over</h2> <p>A stalemate between <strong>Toshiba</strong> and its investors that has kept the industrial conglomerate in financial purgatory for years could finally be giving way to Japan's largest ever take-private deal.</p> <p>However, much like the prolonged struggle that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8083091c-f8b3-41d3-a4f5-0da8af803cb1\">resulted in the resignations</a> of two chief executives, the private equity sale that investors have pinned their hopes on to jump-start Toshiba and dealmaking in Asia is expected to be a slow one.</p> <p><br>Earlier this month, the stand-off that pitted Toshiba's management against its activist shareholders ended with the company appointing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/995bddb8-c310-466b-82e1-119c4414a392\">two independent board members</a> from activist shareholders <strong>Elliott Management</strong> and <strong>Farallon Capital</strong>. That opened the floodgates to a potential buyout that could top $20bn.</p> <p>Toshiba has received 10 investment proposals, including eight proposals for privatisation, the company announced on Thursday. The list of bidders includes<strong> Bain Capital</strong>, <strong>KKR</strong>, <strong>CVC</strong>, <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong>, people with knowledge of the discussions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9449bd8f-7255-4493-8b35-a39b26d8b446\">told our colleagues in Japan</a>.</p> <p><strong>Japan Investment Corporation</strong>, a $30bn government-backed fund, and electronics manufacturer <strong>Nidec</strong> have also expressed interest. </p> <p>But despite the speedy incursion of prospective buyers, the sale will be anything but.</p> <p>For one thing, investors are deeply split on Toshiba's value. With its shares closing at ¥5,816 ($45.31) on Wednesday, some said the bids should come in at ¥6,200-¥6,500, while others said they could go as high as ¥6,800-¥7,200.</p> <p>And once a price is finally agreed, pinning down a consortium of bidders deemed acceptable to Japanese regulators could take years to finalise, said one person involved in the auction.</p> <p>The process will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82561c92-7909-4b04-9881-f5922a090123\">prove the ultimate test</a> for Toshiba's new chief <strong>Taro Shimada</strong> as he attempts to restore trust between management and shareholders and find a buyer that appeases Japanese government officials.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Pamela Abdy</strong> and<strong> Michael De Luca</strong>, the outgoing heads of film studio<strong> MGM</strong>, have reached a deal to run the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c385d236-75a9-467c-86d4-5768e6b21324\">newly merged</a><strong> Warner Bros Discovery</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/michael-de-luca-pam-abdy-warner-bros-1235157014/\">per The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Houlihan Lokey</strong> has hired <strong>Rishi Aswani</strong> as a managing director in its portfolio valuation and fund advisory services practice, based in Mumbai.
