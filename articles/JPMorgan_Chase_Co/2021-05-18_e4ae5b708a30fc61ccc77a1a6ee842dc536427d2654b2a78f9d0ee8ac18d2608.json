  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase has elevated two potential successors to chief executive Jamie Dimon in a reshuffle of its top ranks in which co-chief operating officer Gordon Smith will step down from his roles at the end of the year.</p> <p>Smith, 62, is currently co-president and co-chief operating officer alongside investment banking chief Daniel Pinto, and also heads JPMorgan's consumer and community banking unit, the bank's largest division by revenue.</p> <p>JPMorgan veterans Marianne Lake, 51, and Jennifer Piepszak, 51, will become co-heads of CCB, the bank said on Tuesday. Both are considered potential replacements for Dimon when he eventually steps down.</p> <p>Since 2019, Lake has been head of JPMorgan's consumer lending unit. She was previously group chief financial officer from 2013 to 2019. Piepszak succeeded Lake as CFO.</p> <p>Dimon, who is 65 and underwent emergency heart surgery last year, has led the bank since 2006. The JPMorgan board has said it would like Dimon to stay a “significant number of additional years”, the bank said.</p> <p>“We are fortunate to have two such superb executives in Marianne and Jenn — they both are examples of our extremely talented and deep management bench,” Dimon said in a statement.</p> <p>At the helm of CCB, the two women will oversee a business that generated $51.3bn in revenue last year, about 42 per cent of JPMorgan's total turnover, and has more than 120,000 employees.</p> <p>“It looks like a two-woman race for the CEO job of JPMorgan,” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo told the Financial Times.</p> <p>“The ultimate make-up at the top of JPM will also incrementally better represent the population of the US given additional proportionate diversity, which is an objective of JPM,” Mayo and colleagues wrote in a note to clients.</p> <p>“Marianne and Jenn are both terrific business people,” Smith said in an interview. “They have really great business acumen, they're really thoughtful, they have a good view out in the future strategically.”</p> <p>Jeremy Barnum, 48, currently head of global research for JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, will succeed Piepszak as finance chief.</p> <p>Once Smith leaves, Pinto, 58, will become sole president and chief operating officer. Smith will remain with JPMorgan as a senior adviser to Dimon and other executives.</p> <p>“I have been thinking about my succession over the last couple of years. My wife and I became grandparents over Christmas and we discussed this then,” said Smith.</p> <p>“I helped the bank pilot through Covid and Jamie's health scare [in 2020], so it felt 2022 would be the right time to take a step back.”</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin 2021 'JPMorgan elevates potential successors to Jamie Dimon ' FT.com 18 May.
