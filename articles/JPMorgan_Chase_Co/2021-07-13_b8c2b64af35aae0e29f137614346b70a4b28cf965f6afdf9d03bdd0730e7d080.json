  "text": "<p>   AUSTIN, Texas -- Dozens of state House Democrats left Texas on Monday to deny the Republican-controlled state legislature the quorum necessary to pass voting legislation during a special session. </p><p>   Democratic House members said they were boarding chartered planes bound for Washington D.C., where they hope to draw national support for their fight against the bills. At least 59 of the body's 67 Democrats were expected to participate in the walkout, according to a person familiar with the plans, but the final number might not be known until the House is called to order Tuesday morning. </p><p>   The legislators would have to remain out of state for weeks to avoid voting during the 30-day legislative session, which Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called after a previous walkout by Democrats shortly before a voting deadline killed the legislation at the end of the body's regular session in May. </p><p>    The bill that was considered in May would have set some of the nation's broadest voting restrictions. Mr. Abbott said the legislation is a matter of election security, and an emergency. Democrats say the bills are aimed at preventing their supporters, including many minorities, from voting. </p><p>   After Democrats killed the vote by staging a walkout this spring, Mr. Abbott called the special session for a legislature that typically meets for only five months every other year. </p><p>   The Texas House requires at least two-thirds of its 150 members to be present to conduct official business. Members are expected to move for a \"call of the House\" when they convene Tuesday, to record who is present. Those present can vote for absent lawmakers to be arrested by law-enforcement officers and forced to return to the chamber. Experts said the members remaining out of state makes it unlikely that officers could compel their return. Mr. Abbott has the ability to continue to call special legislative sessions, which are limited to the topic or topics he chooses. </p><p>   \"I do not know when we will return,\" said Rep. Sheryl Cole, an Austin Democrat, in a text message. \"It came to this because of Republican voter suppression.\" </p><p>   The governor called the Democrats' move an abandonment of responsibilities. \"Texas Democrats' decision to break a quorum of the Texas Legislature and abandon the Texas State Capitol inflicts harm on the very Texans who elected them to serve,\" he said. \"The Democrats must put aside partisan political games and get back to the job they were elected to do.\" </p><p>   Both the House and Senate held weekend public hearings on a set of new bills. Both committees advanced the bills, and one or both of them could have seen a floor vote by the full body as soon as Tuesday. </p><p>   Bills filed during the special session by both the state House and Senate would limit early voting hours, place additional restrictions on assisting disabled voters and voting by mail, and make many election missteps felony offenses. The special session was also set to consider funding border security measures, banning the delivery of abortion pills and prohibiting transgender students from competing in university sports in their non-birth gender. </p><p>   The Democrats' flight likely won't kill the Texas Republicans' voting legislation, but it will help Democrats spread their message on a national level, said Cal Jillson, a Texas political expert and professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. </p><p></p>",
