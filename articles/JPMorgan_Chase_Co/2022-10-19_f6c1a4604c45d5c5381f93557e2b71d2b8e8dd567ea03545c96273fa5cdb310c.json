  "text": "<p>As David Solomon set out to sell his latest overhaul of Goldman Sachs to investors on Tuesday, there was little sign of the sharp-tongued titan of the C-suite or the flamboyant “DJ D-Sol” known for frequenting music festivals. Instead, Solomon appeared to be contrite.</p> <p>The second significant restructuring since he became chief executive four years ago was in effect an admission that the bank was under pressure from investors, who had become increasingly sceptical of its ambitions to launch a viable consumer brand after years of losses and high staff turnover.</p> <p>“I appreciate the comment that shareholders haven't been excited about it,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4006fa25-cd2f-409d-9683-296923b93b81\">Solomon</a> said of the foray into consumer banking during a call with investors. “And that certainly affects some of our decision making.”</p> <p>Describing the changes as an “evolution”, Solomon outlined plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cac2059d-4ead-4415-a7ef-74cdfc3c13d2\">pull back from retail banking</a> and instead focus on its traditional strengths serving big companies and rich investors rather than servicing Main Street customers. Goldman's much-vaunted Marcus consumer operation will be folded into a unified asset and wealth management division.</p> <p>The corporate rejigging also underscored that Solomon is still searching for an answer that has bedevilled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a> since he took over, and arguably since the company went public: how can the firm persuade investors to bestow a higher valuation on a bank that remains the envy of many of its Wall Street peers but depends on highly unpredictable revenue streams?</p> <p>“You don't make changes if everything is going perfectly,” said Christian Bolu, banking analyst at Autonomous Research. “So the fact that they're making some changes tells you there's some need to tweak the initial expectations.”</p> <p>Goldman's revamp will see it shrink from four divisions to three. Solomon has merged its investment bank — the company's crown jewel — with its trading division, creating a unit that reminded some veterans of the old Goldman he had tried to unpick. Having separated asset and wealth management in 2019, he is now putting them back together again.</p> <p>A newly formed “Platform Solutions” business will combine the technology Goldman uses to support credit cards for Apple and General Motors and an online lending business, called GreenSky, which it acquired this year.</p> <p>“This is actually something we've been talking about and working toward for the better part of a year,” Solomon said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We've realised that for us, given the way we're set up — we've built very, very good digital platforms and products — that being broad and going to a much broader set of potential customers doesn't play to our strengths.”</p> <p>Goldman's retail banking expansion was much ballyhooed when it launched in 2016 under its previous chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, but that fanfare resulted in intense scrutiny from investors and within the bank as losses and costs mounted.</p> <p>Marcus was successful as a low-cost funding mechanism for Goldman, amassing more than $100bn in customer deposits. But rather than deepening its connections to its retail customers, Goldman will now repackage the technology underpinning Marcus into its private wealth management business.</p> <p>The market cheered the overhaul, which was announced alongside third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Shares of Goldman closed 2.3 per cent higher on Tuesday, outpacing the broader market.</p> <p>Goldman's retreat from “a mass retail strategy” was what investors were waiting for, said Kush Goel, senior research analyst at investment manager Neuberger Berman, which holds Goldman stock. “It shows the management team is willing to reassess and readjust.”</p> <p>The question facing Solomon is whether his new structure will persuade investors to ascribe a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30c61d67-8af9-474e-872a-b0c75258a781\">higher valuation to his bank</a>. Goldman trades at just under its book value, behind its average over the past five years of 1.05. Morgan Stanley, by comparison, trades at about 1.4 times book, with a five-year average of 1.32.</p> <p>The most recent earnings highlighted how reliant Goldman remains on investment banking and trading. Due to the unpredictability of these businesses, they are not highly prized by investors who prefer recurring revenues from fee-based businesses such as wealth management.</p> <p>In the third quarter, investment banking and trading generated 65 per cent of Goldman's revenues. By comparison, the investment banking and trading division last year generated 35 per cent of revenues at JPMorgan and 44.8 per cent at Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Some bankers who know Solomon well say he is right to try to diversify but question how much can be achieved with another restructuring.</p> <p>“It's just discombobulating a lot of the firm,” said one former Goldman banker who worked with Solomon after he became chief executive. “They're moving the deck chairs but not actually managing the firm — just moving things into different buckets.”</p> <p>Solomon had pointed in the past to consumer banking as one of four areas of growth that would diversify Goldman's revenues. Attention will now shift to the three other areas that would make the bank less reliant on dealmaking and trading: asset management, wealth management and transaction banking.</p> <p>Investors have been impressed by fundraising at Goldman's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fb175d7-fcf2-4d82-be0a-62ec49b6ab27\">asset management business</a>, especially in alternative investments such as private equity, but “the jury's still out on the growth initiatives”, said Autonomous Research's Bolu.</p> <p>To oversee Goldman's three new divisions, Solomon picked lieutenants from his existing management team, who will all report to president John Waldron.</p> <p>Dan Dees and Jim Esposito, who run the investment bank, and Ashok Varadhan, co-head of the trading division, will run the combined global banking and markets business. Stephanie Cohen, a close Solomon ally and most recently co-head of Goldman's soon-to-be bygone consumer and wealth management division, will lead the new Platform Solutions unit.</p> <p>A big winner of the reshuffle appears to be Marc Nachmann, who through his work co-leading Goldman's trading division and investment bank has established a reputation for fixating on costs. He will run the combined asset and wealth management business. Julian Salisbury, previously co-head of the standalone asset management division, will become chief investment officer of the asset and wealth business.</p> <p>“Marc's ‘the fixer',” said one Goldman banker. “Private wealth and asset management are about to experience what it's like to work with Marc, which they definitely have not experienced before.”</p> <p>For Solomon, much is riding on whether this latest overhaul can succeed where the last one fell short. “Now, unfortunately for David, the clock is beginning to tick,” the Goldman banker said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Brooke Masters</em></p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs retreats from mass market in long quest for higher valuation' FT.com 19 October.
