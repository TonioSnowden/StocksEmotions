  "title": "Global dealmaking set to break records after frenzied summer ",
  "text": "<p>A frantic summer of dealmaking has put 2021 on track to break records, with almost $4tn of deals already agreed since the start of the year, as companies rush to exploit cheap financing and bumper profits.</p> <p>There were $500bn of transactions globally in the usually quiet month of August, up from $289bn in the same month last year, and $275bn in 2019. The surge has been fuelled by a mix of low borrowing costs, trillions of dollars in the coffers of private equity groups, and the return of animal spirits to corporate boardrooms.</p> <p>The summer boom has helped push global mergers and acquisitions to a record $3.9tn year to date, according to data compiled by Refinitiv, more than double the amount from the same period last year, and up from $2.6tn in 2019.</p> <p>At this pace, total M&amp;A activity this year is set to overtake the all-time high hit before the financial crisis in 2007, when $4.3tn worth of deals were announced.</p> <p>“With most businesses generating record profits, having access to inexpensive debt and experiencing high share prices, it is difficult to see M&amp;A activity slowing over the next six to 12 months,” said Frank Aquila, global head of M&amp;A at law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</p> <p>Many of the almost 40,000 deals announced since January have been large — running into tens billions of dollars — and include a record number of cross-border tie-ups, such as General Electric's decision to sell its aircraft-leasing unit to Irish rival AerCap for more than $30bn, and the battle between Canada's largest railway groups to buy Kansas City Southern for more than $31bn.</p> <p>The deal flurry has boosted revenues on Wall Street. In the most recent quarter, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94e26c0f-4fd3-4d31-a624-8e6ec35ce0ae\">JPMorgan </a>reported record global investment banking fees of $3.6bn, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ded77c47-ce4b-4a33-89c1-2e4ea18cf094\">Goldman Sachs's fees</a> rose by more than a third.</p> <p>Big international law firms have also prospered, with many reporting record profits and partners enjoying bumper pay days. </p> <p>This year's deal frenzy has sparked a battle for talent on both sides of the Atlantic, pushing up salaries for junior lawyers and bankers. </p> <p>M&amp;A activity has also been broad-based, as most industrial sectors have enjoyed double-digit or triple-digit percentage increases in dealmaking compared with last year.</p> <p>The tech sector has led the way, representing 21 per cent of all M&amp;A activity, up from 16 per cent last year, marking the strongest proportion since the tech boom year of 2000.</p> <p>So far this year, tech companies have struck 8,742 transactions worth $832bn, up from $301bn worth of deals agreed in the same period last year, and $291bn in 2019. </p> <p>Some of the largest tech transactions included Dell's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba3cc6ab-b7a1-4fda-a5d7-11ea8c00c851\">$52bn spin-off</a> of VMware, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">Grab's $40bn merger</a> with a special purpose acquisition company, and Microsoft's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a36dd469-e521-4ce7-9351-ddc8f6b5cb42\">buy voice recognition</a> pioneer Nuance for $16bn.</p> <p>“High valuations of public tech companies are providing them with real currency to afford certain acquisitions — their stock is attractive to potential target companies,” said Atif Azher, a corporate partner at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.</p> <p>“There is also an increased emphasis for businesses to use technology to help drive efficiency and connectivity, which has been accelerated by the pandemic,” he added.</p> <p>Dealmaking in financial services and real estate has also experienced a boom, with a string of big acquisitions, including Square's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bc49035-87f8-440e-9c20-5af34d40d4ad\">$29bn all-stock acquisition</a> of Australian “buy now, pay later” provider Afterpay and Vici Properties' <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210804005523/en/VICI-Properties-Inc.-Announces-17.2-Billion-Strategic-Acquisition-of-MGM-Growth-Properties-LLC\">$17.2bn deal</a> with MGM Growth Properties.</p> <p>“In the real estate sector, a depressed 2020 real estate market due to the pandemic is now leading to opportunities for consolidation and investment, especially given low-interest rates,” said Krishna Veeraraghavan, an M&amp;A partner at law firm Paul Weiss.</p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c7a4e92-9cd9-4d3e-842f-39b7faba092b\"><em>Boards should be savvy on private equity valuations</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c7a4e92-9cd9-4d3e-842f-39b7faba092b\"><em>From Adrian Buckley, Emeritus Professor, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield University, Bedford, Bedfordshire, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan in New York 2021 'Global dealmaking set to break records after frenzied summer ' FT.com 5 September.
