  "text": "<p>Royal Dutch Shell said higher oil prices had helped it cut its debt pile, paving the way for higher shareholder returns in the second quarter.</p> <p>In a trading statement on Wednesday ahead of results due at the end of the month, the Anglo-Dutch energy major said it would increase payouts to investors, to between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of cash flow from operations, through buybacks or dividends.</p> <p>Shares in the company rose 2.75 per cent in early London trading.</p> <p>Shell, which did not provide guidance on which form the distributions would take, said the higher payouts were the result of “strong operational and financial delivery, combined with an improved macroeconomic outlook”.</p> <p>The company has previously said that once net debt shrunk to below $65bn it would increase returns. </p> <p>Shell did not specifically confirm on Wednesday whether it had hit this target but said it would now “retire” this benchmark, which is sooner than analysts and company executives had expected. “In the second quarter, Shell expects to have further reduced its net debt,” it added.</p> <p>Christyan Malek at JPMorgan said the latest announcement marked an “important milestone that highlights the strength of Shell's free cash flow proposition”.</p> <p>As the pandemic raged last year, Shell cut its dividend by two-thirds to 16 cents, the first reduction since the second world war. </p> <p>Since then it has sought to woo back investors, raising the payout to 16.65 cents in October and then by another 4 per cent to 17.35 cents a share in the first three months of 2021. </p> <p>However, after reporting first-quarter results in April, Jessica Uhl, Shell's chief financial officer, told the Financial Times “we are not anticipating a further increase” in the dividend for this year.</p> <p>Oil companies have been helped by rising crude prices on the back of a recovery in demand as governments ease travel bans and lockdowns and amid supply cuts by Opec producers and allies including Russia. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has risen above $75 a barrel in recent days, an increase of roughly 50 per cent since the start of the year. </p> <p>Along with highlighting its capital discipline and improved cash position, Shell also noted several weaker aspects of its business. It said trading of liquefied natural gas was “significantly below average”, while oil products sales were well below levels before the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>Source: Anjli Raval 2021 'Shell prepares to raise shareholder payouts' FT.com 7 July.
