  "text": "<p>The effects of Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic are changing our perceptions of robots — transformed from enemies that will steal jobs to heroes who can rescue us from chronic labour shortages and boring, repetitive tasks. </p> <p>Banks are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a9a5c09-b002-4601-bb98-c25114638d8c\">automating “grunt work” </a>to stop a talent drain, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34b831a5-f6d9-4438-924d-b2999a714663\">Harry Dempsey and Dave Lee report</a> the pandemic boom in online shopping has accelerated the switch to automated systems and robots in warehouses, as demand for next-day delivery increases.</p> <p>The UK is leading the investments and globally, warehouses are expected to put $36bn into automation this year, up 20 per cent on 2020.&#xa0;</p> <p>In agriculture, farmers have been suffering from a lack of workers to bring their harvests in, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee933d30-43fc-47ff-b00f-8e7b1c695516\">crops rotting in the fields</a> this summer. They will soon be aided by Precision Agriculture that can pinpoint the location of individual plants and enable full autonomy of machinery, such as self-driving tractors, <a href=\"https://newspressuk.com/publicReleaseView/99666/55612\">says software provider VNC Automotive</a>. </p> <p>Factories have long been largely automated, with a growing population of robots. The ultimate goal there is “lights-out manufacturing”, where there is no human presence and lights and even ventilation can be turned off.</p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.luxresearchinc.com/the-path-to-lights-out-manufacturing-press-release-report-download\"> new report by Lux Research</a> predicts most manufacturing tasks that require one or two highly mature robots will be automated between the late 2020s and early 2030s. “However, highly unstructured tasks like equipment repair and installation will probably always require some human intervention,” meaning full “lights-out” will remain unrealistic for most companies.</p> <p>The future with robots therefore looks collaborative, and we can learn to live and work with them. They should make our jobs easier, not disappear.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. US concerned at chip supply transparency</strong><br>Biden administration officials are pressing semiconductor companies<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bd59b60-c53d-4796-93f4-d0f51c2b5066\"> for “more transparency” </a>about their supply chains as they rush to alleviate a global chip crisis. Officials said they would formally request more information. This week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d53c177-cf1f-47dd-bfa1-bcb9039ceaea\">#techAsia newsletter </a>leads on how fake chips are bedevilling Asian supply chains.</p> <p><strong>2. Facebook's chief technology officer to exit</strong>&#xa0;<br>Facebook veteran Mike Schroepfer, a trusted lieutenant of chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, is&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad123117-483c-40e0-ad25-99a77ee80c6d\">to leave the social media network</a>&#xa0;as it battles its biggest public relations crisis since the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&#xa0;The exit is the latest in a string of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72793eee-145a-4da9-bcf5-1b6f661cc9ac\">high-profile departures</a>&#xa0;from Facebook in recent months.</p> <p><strong>3. Robinhood to test cryptocurrency wallets</strong>&#xa0;<br>The controversial retail stock brokerage said yesterday it would&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44a7b9b1-d658-4c2a-bbf3-34af30aeaa8b\">begin offering crypto wallets</a>&#xa0;on its platform. The move will allow its customers to directly own and transfer bitcoin and other&#xa0;cryptocurrencies&#xa0;in order to pay for goods and services. Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5fcc1f4-617f-415e-aff5-6182c8d07379\">Gillian Tett examines</a> the implications of wealthy Afghans using crypto to store wealth and move money overseas. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0380747-7a6c-4dfc-9cfe-f7aa48023fea\">Helen Thomas asks</a> when does a start-up have a $3tn balance sheet? When it's JPMorgan Chase starting a digital neobank in the UK, is the answer.</p> <p><strong>4. Russia switches disinformation tactics</strong><br>Reader comment sections of western media outlets such as the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, Fox News and Der Spiegel are increasingly being manipulated by propagandists, who then point to pro-Kremlin comments as evidence of sympathy for the Russian government in the west. The comments are used as the basis for positive news stories in the Russian media,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9efbeac4-8dde-4e51-bb47-d4ae9d504d92\">reports Martha Muir</a>.</p> <p><strong>5. The spectrum of innovation</strong><br>Tech breakthroughs rely on the collective “scenius” as much as individual genius, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d956b2d1-ff00-4ded-bbd3-0fce2bf5c134\">argues John Thornhill</a> in his latest column, prompted by the death of Sir Clive Sinclair last week. FT readers had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f14a9c24-33cf-4873-8012-e7eaa7109d42?commentID=99a7f508-05ee-4cd3-ae29-469ad01dfa2d\">many fond memories</a> of the ZX series computers when we assessed the inventor's life.</p> <h2>Forwarded from&#xa0;Sifted&#xa0;— the European start-up week</h2> <p>A blockchain-based&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/sorare-nft-series-b-softbank/\">fantasy football game company called Sorare</a>&#xa0;this week raised one of the biggest European funding rounds of the year, bringing in $680m in a deal led by SoftBank. It comes amid a gold rush for start-ups picking up on the craze for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are a way of assigning ownership of digital items using the blockchain that is being used by Sorare. Also this week, an NFT marketplace for&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/nft-sneakers-futures-factory/\">sneakers called&#xa0;Futures Factory</a>&#xa0;raised $2.5m from some of Europe's top investors — notably Seedcamp, Stride, Kima Ventures and RTP Global.</p> <p>Elsewhere in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/rankings/european-startups-top-rankings\">European start-ups</a>, the virtual-world company Improbable unveiled a software project called “<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/improbable-metaverse-stealth-project/\">Project Morpheus</a>” which may finally help justify its lofty metaverse ambitions. Finally, Sifted looks at the new wave of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/european-startups-cars-smartphones/\">European start-ups thinking up new opportunities from the connected car</a>&#xa0;— from buttocks monitoring to remote driving to haptic controls.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Facebook's new Portals</h2> <p>Facebook has <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-two-new-portals-including-first-portable-version/\">launched two new versions </a>of its Portal smart home device, which is Alexa-enabled and focused on video conferencing. The $199 Portal Go adds portability, running on batteries and featuring a carry handle. It has a 10.1in screen and includes a 12MP Smart Camera with an ultrawide field of view for immersive video calls. It also doubles as a portable speaker with room-filling sound. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/new-facebook-portals-add-portable-option-and-more-work-from-home-smarts/\">Cnet says </a>the updated Portal+ is sleeker than the original and the screen is an inch or so smaller at 14in. It has a higher resolution screen than the Go and a higher price at $349. Both new models will begin shipping on October 19.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Reassessing robots' roles' FT.com 23 September.
