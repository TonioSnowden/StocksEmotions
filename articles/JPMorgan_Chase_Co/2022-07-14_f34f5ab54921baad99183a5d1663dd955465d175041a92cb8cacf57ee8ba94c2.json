  "text": "<p>However, the rise in eurozone factory output was almost entirely down to U.S. businesses that operate in Ireland, while U.K. growth was partly driven by the lifting of two years of restricted access to local health services.</p><p>Both the U.K. and eurozone economies grew in the first three months of the year, in contrast with the U.S., which experienced a contraction. However, the surge in home energy prices that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine has significantly slowed the recovery from the pandemic, as households cut back on other goods and services.</p><p>\"It's barely enough to pay the bills,\" said Arthur Hodson, a sports instructor from Liverpool, northwestern England. \"The main things you have to pay for are a roof over your head, gas, water and food. Everything after that is a luxury.\"</p><p>Figures released by the European Union's statistics agency Wednesday showed industrial output was 0.8% higher in May than in April. However, output fell in France, Italy and Spain and was only slightly higher in Germany. By contrast, Irish output surged 13.9%, driven by a rise in output from U.S. factories based in the country, which accounts for 5.1% of the eurozone's total industrial production.</p><p>Without Ireland, eurozone output was stagnant. Economists expect that stagnation would quickly turn to decline if Russia's supplies of natural gas to Europe weren't to resume after scheduled maintenance that shut the Nord Stream pipeline Monday. Germany's central bank estimates that a halt to supplies that required some rationing would lead to a 3.25% drop in economic activity in the eurozone's largest economy from the third quarter of this year through the second quarter of 2023.</p><p>Some other estimates see a larger cost depending on the scale of the shortfall for factories. In a recent joint study, Germany's leading economic institutes forecast a decline of as much as 9.9% or as little as 1.6% depending on the extent of the hypothetical gas shortfall.</p><p>One key question is how successful efforts to reduce household consumption might be, and the institutes urged the government to allow home gas bills to rise in line with world market prices to discourage home consumption. But while home-energy usage is low during the summer months, with few homes operating air conditioning, there would be a pressing need to give priority to households during the winter.</p><p>According to JPMorgan, 36% of natural gas consumed in Germany during 2021 was used by factories, while 31% was used by households. About half of that came from Russia, although the share fell to about 35% in the first four months of the year.</p><p>Figures released Wednesday by the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics showed gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the goods and services produced in a country -- was 0.5% higher in May than in April. However, that partly reflects the reopening of a large part of the state-run health service.</p><p>---</p><p>Elissa Miolene contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
