  "title": "Business News:  MGM Resorts to Sell  Las Vegas CityCenter  ----  By Katherine Sayre",
  "text": "<p>   MGM Resorts International agreed to take full ownership of the huge CityCenter property on the Las Vegas Strip in a complex arrangement to sell real estate, but still gain all the revenues from operating the massive Strip casino, the company said Thursday. </p><p>   CityCenter is a glassy complex with hotel-condo towers and luxury shopping, originally built for $8.7 billion, but it nearly plunged into bankruptcy after construction costs skyrocketed and it opened amid an economic recession in 2009. </p><p>   If the deal finalizes, MGM, which is the largest operator on the Strip, would continue a now well-worn financial strategy to bulk up its cash balance while owning less real estate in Vegas. </p><p>   The announcement comes as the gambling industry recovers from the pandemic, with tourists returning to the Strip and casino operators reporting busy weekends. Under the deal, MGM Resorts plans to buy out its 50% partner in CityCenter, Dubai World subsidiary Infinity World Development Corp., for $2.1 billion. The deal values CityCenter at $5.8 billion, including $1.5 billion in debt, the company said. </p><p>   In turn, MGM Resorts agreed to sell the real estate of CityCenter's Aria and Vdara hotels for $3.89 billion in cash to Blackstone Group, pending the close of the Infinity World deal, the company said. Blackstone would lease the properties back to MGM for initial annual rent of $215 million. </p><p>   The deal is in line with other sale-leaseback arrangements MGM Resorts has made in recent years, including for the Bellagio, MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay. MGM operates 13 resorts on the Strip. </p><p>   \"We expect to continue executing our asset-light strategy and utilizing the proceeds from our real-estate transactions to enhance our financial flexibility and secure new growth opportunities,\" said MGM Chief Executive Bill Hornbuckle, meaning MGM would rather have the cash than tie it up in real-estate ownership. </p><p>   In a note, Jefferies analysts said the company's plans for the proceeds, along with its existing cash balance, could include further investment in MGM's online betting operations, BetMGM, as casinos compete in the growing digital gambling space. MGM plans to pay the $1.5 billion in debt it would take on in the transaction, leaving about $250 million in cash proceeds, a company spokesman said. </p><p>   In January, MGM made an unsuccessful bid to buy its BetMGM partner, British gambling company Entain PLC, for GBP 8.09 billion, equivalent to $10.99 billion. </p><p>   MGM Resorts had $6.2 billion of cash and $13.4 billion in debt as of March 31. The deals announced Thursday are expected to close in the third quarter, the company said. </p><p>   In a research note, JP Morgan said Thursday's agreement shows continuing buyer interest in Las Vegas Strip assets, which bodes well for other operators looking to sell. </p><p>   MGM's rival Caesars Entertainment Inc. has been considering selling one of its Las Vegas properties. CEO Tom Reeg said in May that plan is on hold until casino revenues recover from the pandemic, likely not until next year. </p><p></p>",
