  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: New York City's Office- Space Glut Isn't Moving --- The supply of sublet offices is swelling just as developers are building lots of shiny new blocks",
  "text": "<p>State Street is the latest company to release sublet space into Manhattan's already glutted office market, according to a report this week in The Wall Street Journal. This follows similar moves by corporate tenants including Peloton and Macy's who are trying to shed property. JPMorgan Chase, whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is publicly bullish about returning to the office, has put up 700,000 square feet for sublet at 4 New York Plaza.</p><p>If a company has several years left on a lease, sublets can be a useful way to cut property costs. The trend is bad news for the city's landlords, however, who now face tough competition from their own tenants. On average, the asking rent on sublet space in Manhattan is 27% lower than the cost of a direct lease, based on Colliers data.</p><p>Since the pandemic began, growth in sublet square footage has outstripped that of space offered directly by landlords. By the end of July, tenant-released supply made up 23% of New York's total office availability. In the early summer months, it looked as though this supply was drying up. But the situation reversed in July, when several big blocks came onto the market, pushing sublet availability to a post-pandemic high.</p><p>The trend puts pressure on the rents New York landlords can charge new tenants, making it hard for the likes of SL Green and its peer Empire State Realty Trust to fully recover. Shares in both companies still trade around one-fifth below their pre-pandemic levels, despite rallying this year as investors become more positive about the outlook for New York's economy.</p><p>Even without a global health crisis, the Manhattan office market was at risk of oversupply. Around 25 million square feet of extra space, in the form of newly built blocks and major renovations of existing buildings, are to be added between 2022 and 2024 -- the most in a three-year period since the late 1980s, says Franklin Wallach, a senior managing director at Colliers. To put that number in perspective, there is already 21 million square feet of New York sublet space actively looking for tenants.</p><p>Shiny new offices tend to be the easiest to rent out. Corporate occupants are more likely to sign leases on modern and energy-efficient buildings that will help them hit carbon-reduction goals and give employees a reason to commute again. In a good sign, SL Green recently said its new Midtown property at One Vanderbilt, which opens in October, is already 90% rented.</p><p>It will be harder for owners of properties coming off lease. Until the gush of supply from companies like State Street slows, it is too early to say the worst is over for New York's office landlords.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
