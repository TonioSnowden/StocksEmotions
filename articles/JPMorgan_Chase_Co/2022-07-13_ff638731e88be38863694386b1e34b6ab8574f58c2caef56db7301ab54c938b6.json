  "title": "Biden Nominee for Fed's Top Banking Regulator Confirmed as Fed Governor; Confirmation gives central bank a full seven-member board; Senate set to vote to consider Barr for key regulatory post",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Barr's confirmation provides the central bank with a full seven-member board for the first time in nearly a decade and would add to a group of Biden-appointed financial watchdogs. Mr. Barr has a record that suggests he might seek to restore at least some of the financial rules that were eased by the Fed during the Trump administration.</p><p>The supervision role that Mr. Barr would fill is responsible for developing a broad vision for the regulation of big banks. That includes recommendations for the Fed board and for overseeing its regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Mr. Barr is the last of President Biden's slate of five appointees to the central bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and three other appointments were confirmed in recent months.</p><p>A veteran of the Obama and Clinton administrations, Mr. Barr would succeed Randal Quarles, a Republican official who left the Fed in December.</p><p>Several other regulatory nominees have failed to gain traction in the evenly divided Senate. Mr. Biden's first nominee for the Fed banking-supervision post, Sarah Bloom Raskin, withdrew from consideration in March after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, said he couldn't support the nomination, citing her views on addressing climate change.</p><p>Mr. Barr's confirmation was widely expected after the Senate voted 66-27 on a key procedural matter Tuesday. Several Republicans backed the nominee, including Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Separately, Mr. Manchin, who isn't a member of the banking panel, endorsed Mr. Barr ahead of his May nomination hearing.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Nominee for Fed's Top Banking Regulator Confirmed as Fed Governor</p>",
