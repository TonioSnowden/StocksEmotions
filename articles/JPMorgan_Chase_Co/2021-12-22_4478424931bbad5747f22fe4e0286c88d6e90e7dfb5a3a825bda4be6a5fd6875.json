  "title": "Big Tech Show to Go On Despite Pullouts --- Amazon, Meta, T- Mobile CEO withdraw from event amid surging Covid cases",
  "text": "<p>The Consumer Technology Association is kicking off the biggest U.S. tech conference the first week of January with a scaled-back crowd and vaccine and mask requirements. While there is a digital component, the organization expects 50,000 to 75,000 attendees at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other venues.</p><p>In a normal year, the show gathered close to 200,000 attendees, though it went entirely online last January.</p><p>\"Right now we have exhibitors building booths in Las Vegas,\" CTA Chief Executive Gary Shapiro said Friday, adding that the exhibitor count was rising, not dropping. He said the event will proceed unless a government mandate were to make it impossible to host.</p><p>The newer Covid variant is driving increased Covid-19 cases across the country. It is causing companies such as Apple Inc. to reconsider plans to open their offices. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s big San Francisco healthcare conference, scheduled for mid-January, will be taking place online. And next month's Davos Economic Forum has been postponed for the second straight year.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the tech industry has tended to lead other sectors in taking health precautions. For the not-for-profit CTA, which represents the $422 billion U.S. consumer tech industry, CES is the trademark event. The show gathers companies from around the world to show off innovations and make deals with retailers, wireless carriers and other partners.</p><p>CES 2020, which hosted over 170,000 attendees and more than 4,500 exhibitors, was one of the last major U.S. events before the coronavirus lockdowns. The 2021 conference took place fully virtually, with companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Corp. hosting press conferences online.</p><p>This year's CES kicks off Jan. 3 with in-person press events. As of Tuesday, over 2,100 companies had committed to exhibiting at the show, with keynotes from Abbott Laboratories, General Motors Co. and Samsung. Digital show participants could access more than 50 conference sessions and keynotes online.</p><p>T-Mobile late Tuesday said its CEO, Mike Sievert, wouldn't deliver a planned keynote address in Las Vegas. Nor would he give a presentation virtually. The company will \"significantly limit\" its in-person participation at CES, with the majority of its team staying away from the event, according to a news release.</p><p>Samsung said it is \"closely monitoring\" the health situation and is taking steps, such as having a smaller team on-site in Las Vegas.</p><p>Companies have adjusted to launching products online and participating with colleagues, partners and reporters over Zoom. However, the lack of an in-person component of CES has an impact on the tech industry's deal makers, who find the show convenient for face-to-face meetings and chance interactions. Travel restrictions and quarantine requirements had already reduced the scope of this year's show.</p><p>TCL Technology, the Chinese company that builds inexpensive TVs and smartphones, plans to attend the show in person, with most staff coming from its U.S. operations. Currently, China requires people to quarantine for 21 days upon returning to Hong Kong , which makes it difficult for TCL to send many people from its headquarters. Aaron Zhang, the Shenzhen-based CEO of TCL's mobile division, is already in the U.S. in advance of the show.</p><p>\"CES, for TCL, is very, very important,\" said Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL's mobile business. \"[We] can, in one week, meet with everyone in the industry.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, iHeartRadio canceled its CES concert party, which was to take place Jan. 6. In a press statement, Amazon said, \"Due to the quickly shifting situation and uncertainty around the Omicron variant, we will no longer have an on-site presence at CES.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Joanna Stern, Mike Colias and Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
