  "text": "<p>How do you solve a problem like Maria? Digital assets, to the confusion of investment analysts, have many characteristics in common with the novice nun from <em>The Sound of Music</em>. They are exuberant, independent and increasingly popular. How are analysts supposed to “hold a moonbeam in [their hands]” as the song puts it?</p> <p>Investment banks have begun producing research on digital assets in response to demand and a fear of missing out. Coverage of cryptocurrencies, a sub sector of that group, will include price data and theories on supply, demand and regulation. Clients hoping for compelling valuations will be disappointed. </p> <p>Until recently, regulated institutions avoided analysing and dealing in unregulated digital assets of which most watchdogs disapproved. Moreover, there was no flow of corporate finance deals to help justify it.</p> <p>Now JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have started publishing research on digital assets and their business ecosystem. In Europe, so have Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca. </p> <p>The developments covered include which publicly listed companies can earn a living from the new industry. These are worth about $130bn, according to Bank of America. Much of that comes from the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which floated in April and already makes billions in net profits. Silvergate Capital, a pure play crypto bank, is also profitable. </p> <p>Banks must believe more crypto winners are coming. Venture capital funding exceeded $17bn in the first half of 2021, trebling last year's figure. Takeovers within the industry totalled $4.2bn in the year to August, on the way to doubling the total for 2019. </p> <p>One issue niggles. Blockchain has huge potential to streamline transactions in underlying conventional assets. But cryptocurrencies themselves create solutions where no problem exists, as Andrea Filtri at Mediobanca puts it.</p> <p>Most brokerage analysts spend their days valuing future profits, no matter how distant, from the businesses of securities issuers. Cryptos produce no direct yields in real money. Without that underpinning, valuing cryptos themselves — rather than companies dealing in them — is an exercise of dubious intellectual validity.</p> <p><em>This is the second in a week-long Lex series on digital assets. The first, on bitcoin in a bear market, is </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e02693a-1338-4b03-bfb3-2bc92bd193d5\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9685ce30-e218-4ca4-80dc-342a8e2271b5\"><em>Wholesale capital markets crave crypto regulation</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9685ce30-e218-4ca4-80dc-342a8e2271b5\"><em>From David E Rutter, Founder and Chief Executive, R3, Former Chief Executive, ICAP, London EC2, UK</em></a></p><p>Source:  2021 'Digital assets: investment analysts tackle solutions that lack problems' FT.com 19 October.
