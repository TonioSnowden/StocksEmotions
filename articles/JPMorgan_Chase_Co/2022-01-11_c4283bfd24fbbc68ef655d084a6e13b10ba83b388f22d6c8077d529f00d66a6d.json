  "title": "Bank of America to Reduce Overdraft Fees to $10; The company is following other big banks in adjusting its overdraft policies",
  "text": "<p>These and earlier changes rolled out in recent years will lead to the company's overdraft fee revenues being reduced by 97% from 2009 levels, it said Tuesday.</p><p>The fees, which are charged when customers don't have enough cash in their accounts to cover charges, have for years been a source of both income and controversy for the nation's biggest banks.</p><p>Overdraft fees have been targeted by Democratic politicians, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), who say such charges exploit low-income workers.</p><p>Bank of America is following other big banks in adjusting their overdraft policies. Capital One Financial Corp. is ditching its $35 overdraft fee altogether, and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. last month said it would give customers who overdraw until the end of the next business day to replenish their bank accounts.</p><p>Last June, Ally Financial Inc. said it also would eliminate its $25 overdraft fee. Ally decided to eliminate the fees after positive customer feedback when it temporarily suspended the charges in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, Diane Morais, Ally Bank's president of consumer and commercial banking, said at the time.</p><p>Ms. Morais said then that such penalties disproportionately affect people who are living paycheck to paycheck as well as Black and Latino households.</p><p>Many big banks were lenient on overdraft fees when the pandemic hit, with most waiving the charges when customers asked for help. In 2020, banks' overdraft revenue fell for the first time in six years, according to financial-data firm Moebs Services Inc. Still, firms collected $31.3 billion in the fees in 2020, Moebs calculates.</p><p>\"Over the last decade, we have made significant changes to our overdraft services and solutions, reducing clients' reliance on overdraft, and providing resources to help clients manage their deposit accounts and overall finances responsibly,\" said Bank of America's president of retail banking, Holly O'Neill.</p><p>Orla McCaffrey contributed to this article.</p><p>Bank of America to Reduce Overdraft Fees to $10</p>",
