  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Activist hedge fund <strong>ValueAct Capital</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b69100bf-c857-4992-894a-af85ad0e164b\">has acquired</a> a 7 per cent stake in The New York Times Company and is putting pressure on the media group to boost digital sales by pushing subscribers towards a higher-priced bundle of its products.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Ping An cranks up its attack on HSBC</p></li>  <li><p>Brookfield lines up potential successors&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h1>Ping An's crusade</h1> <p>In an interview with the FT last year, <strong>HSBC </strong>chief executive <strong>Noel Quinn</strong> vowed he wouldn't <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75b73313-9bbb-499d-8e76-8954a79fad8f\">“flip-flop”</a> on the bank's China strategy every time there was a flare-up in tensions between Beijing and the west.</p> <p>What he didn't know was that his plans to expand across the region faced a more immediate threat: HSBC's largest shareholder, <strong>Ping An</strong>.</p> <p>As the Chinese insurer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e393254-3a78-415c-903c-6de669228c78\">escalates its calls</a> for what would be the biggest shake-up in the bank's 157-year history — a split of its Asian and western operations — Quinn and HSBC's chair <strong>Mark Tucker </strong>have dug their feet in even deeper.</p> <p>So has Ping An's chair <strong>Peter Ma</strong>. The Chinese tycoon has been agitating for a break-up since February, frustrated by years of underperformance and the cancellation of its dividend during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>HSBC's arguments that separating the current structure would be too complex and threaten Hong Kong's status as a hub for international finance, bolstered by better than expected second-quarter earnings, have done little to slow Ma's mission.</p> <p>Ping An told HSBC's management that “almost all of its revenue growth was dependent on a phased, shortlived and uncontrollable interest rate hike cycle” and that its “underperformance has not yet been fundamentally addressed and it is in urgent need of radical change”, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>And no matter how much performance improves, Ping An has warned, HSBC can only walk the geopolitical tightrope between China and the west for so long. </p> <p>HSBC has made attempts to prove otherwise. In July, the FT reported that it became the first foreign lender to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac99fd9-0c30-4141-821a-45348f61c113\">install a Chinese Communist party committee</a> in its Chinese investment banking subsidiary. </p> <p>Wall Street executives, feeling the pressure to follow suit in their own mainland China operations, have become unnerved by the optics of potentially exposing sensitive information to the CCP, several told the FT.</p> <p>The move also sparked vitriol in Washington. “The mask has now come off HSBC,” Republican congressman <strong>Michael Gallagher </strong>told the FT, questioning which banks would be next to “humiliate themselves” by establishing Communist party cells. </p> <p>“Communist party committees are not just for show. They exist to influence, monitor and ultimately control the company,” said Florida Republican <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>.</p> <p>The backlash has only bolstered Ma's argument that straddling China and the West will become impossible in the years to come.</p> <p>The attack on HSBC is a rare step into the limelight for Ma, one of China's so-called “three horses'‘ alongside <strong>Alibaba</strong> founder <strong>Jack Ma</strong> and <strong>Tencent </strong>boss<strong> Pony Ma</strong>. The fiercely private insurance mogul has until now kept a lower profile than his billionaire peers, whose&#xa0;business dealings have drawn the wary attention of Beijing officials.</p> <p>“He is a more deft and less flashy player,” a Hong Kong financier who mixes in Ma's social circles <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28a50e79-16a7-4e31-a7d4-d4bc1a2e4bda\">told the FT's Tabby Kinder earlier this year</a>. “He has cultivated a quiet attitude. He understands that he is on a boat where he's not the captain.”</p> <p>But Ma appears willing to take on the extra publicity if it means seeing the break-up through, even if it means putting himself and his vast fortune in the crosshairs of China's Communist party.</p> <h1>The next generation emerges inside Brookfield&#xa0;</h1> <p>When <strong>Bruce Flatt</strong> took the reins of <strong>Brookfield Asset Management </strong>in the early 2000s, he was a 30-something trained accountant without name recognition on Wall Street. </p> <p>Twenty years later, Brookfield has become the world's second-largest alternative asset manager to <strong>Blackstone</strong>, with over $750bn in assets spanning real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and buyouts. Nonetheless, Flatt may hand off the empire he built alongside a close group of partners to a similarly baby-faced leader. </p> <p>On Thursday, Brookfield began to outline its succession plans for Flatt as it spins off a stake in its asset management unit in a bid to increase its stock price. It also named former <strong>Bank</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>England</strong> governor <strong>Mark</strong> <strong>Carney</strong> as chair of the asset manager, which will be spun off by year end.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4884af97-ffac-4dc4-872f-01cc828f19c3\">Four names have emerged</a>, reports DD's Antoine Gara, which reflect a vastly different culture than Wall Street rivals. </p> <p>Two are trained accountants, three studied at Canadian universities. All have spent over a decade inside the Toronto-based firm taking increasingly prominent positions under the eye of Flatt &amp; Co. without building a big public presence.</p> <p><strong>Connor</strong> <strong>Teskey</strong>, 34, will be president of Brookfield's newly spun asset manager, putting him in one of the most prominent spots in the Brookfield empire. </p> <p>In effect, Teskey, who a decade ago was a debt origination analyst at a Canadian bank, will count <strong>Jonathan</strong> <strong>Gray</strong>, the multi-billionaire president of Blackstone and architect of its $320bn-in-assets real estate division, as his counterpart.</p> <p>Other potential successors include <strong>Anuj</strong> <strong>Ranjan</strong>, head of Brookfield's European private equity platform, who will become president of the firm's broader private equity group. He helped build Brookfield's presence in India and has grown its assets in the Middle East. </p> <p><strong>Sachin</strong> <strong>Shah</strong>, a certified public accountant and Brookfield lifer who led its $25bn publicly traded renewable energy operations for years, is a contender. He'll head Brookfield's publicly listed reinsurance business, which the group plans to expand aggressively. </p> <p><strong>Nick</strong> <strong>Goodman</strong>, an accountant who joined Brookfield in 2010, will be appointed president and chief financial officer of Brookfield's remaining company, tasked with allocating capital across a balance sheet holding tens of billions of dollars in real estate and public equity stakes.</p> <p>“[We] believe it is once again time to further strengthen our senior management team with the elevation of the next generation of leaders,” Flatt said in a letter to investors.</p> <p>Left unsaid: Flatt, 57, isn't going anywhere. He will remain chief executive and a board member of Brookfield's asset manager and its remainco.</p> <p>The current heads of Brookfield's real estate, private equity and infrastructure businesses — <strong>Brian</strong> <strong>Kingston</strong>, <strong>Cyrus</strong> <strong>Madon</strong> and <strong>Sam</strong> <strong>Pollock</strong> — will continue to lead their respective units and hold board seats at the asset manager.</p> <p>If succession happens, it will skip these leaders, whose careers have all overlapped with Flatt, and move to the next generation.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tudor Brown</strong>, the former president of UK chipmaker <strong>Arm</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de462b49-af36-49e7-aace-40d1ef46cc34\">has resigned</a> from the board of China's biggest chipmaker,<strong> Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp,</strong> after nine years, citing a widening “international divide” between the west and China. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>'s global head of credit trading, <strong>Guy America</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jp-morgans-global-head-credit-markets-depart-bank-2022-08-11/\">is leaving the bank,</a> according to Reuters.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jefferies Financial Group</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-11/jefferies-is-said-to-hire-citi-s-biller-in-asia-expansion-blitz\">has hired</a> veteran investment banker <strong>David Biller </strong>from <strong>Citigroup </strong>to boost its presence in Asia, according to Bloomberg.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</strong> has hired<strong> Carol Van der Vorst</strong> as a partner on its leveraged finance team in London. She joins from<strong> Ropes &amp; Gray</strong>. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Read it and weep</strong> M&amp;A bankers looking for a change of scenery <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-11/stephen-king-won-t-kill-penguin-s-acquisition-of-publisher-simon-schuster?sref=fLR6XBbO\">ought to consider a job in publishing</a>, Bloomberg's Chris Hughes writes, as Penguin's literary agents flex their dealmaking skills in the fight to prevent the US government from blocking its takeover of Simon &amp; Schuster.</p> <p><strong>Reality bites </strong>Silicon Valley's ruling generation of bright-eyed, boyish founders are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/business/silicon-valley-boy-boss.html\">dismounting their unicorns</a>, the New York Times writes, as the tech rout spawns an exodus of the industry's most quixotic characters.</p> <p><strong>And here's a smart watch: </strong>Carvana fast-tracked its share price with aggressive marketing tactics and risky securitised consumer loans.
