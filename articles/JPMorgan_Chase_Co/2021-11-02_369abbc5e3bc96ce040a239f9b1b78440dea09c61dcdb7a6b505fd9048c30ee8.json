  "title": "Citi prepares for Asia retail retreat as bids for consumer businesses roll in ",
  "text": "<p>Citigroup is closing in on its goal to scale back in retail banking across much of Asia, drawing a curtain on the Wall Street group's ambitions to be a global consumer bank. </p> <p>The US group is preparing to part ways with about 16,000 staff — a quarter of its workforce in Asia — and hundreds of thousands of customers by early next year as it considers offers for its retail banking operations in the region.</p> <p>Citi received about 40 final bids from rival banks for its retail lending businesses in a dozen Asian markets this month, according to two people close to the matter, and expects to sign deals to sell them by the second quarter of next year. </p> <p>Standard Chartered and Singapore's DBS Bank are among the bidders, the people said. Standard Chartered declined to comment and DBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>The offers came after a six-month sales process that has extended uncertainty for staff and clients.</p> <p>Chief executive Jane Fraser had announced that the Asia consumer businesses, alongside those in eastern Europe, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ca269fc-f257-4aed-a5c9-03e140a10a54\">would be sold</a> just five weeks after she took on the top job in February, saying they lacked “the scale we need to compete”.</p> <p>The disposal will mark an unravelling of the global expansion pursued by former chief executive Sandy Weill in the early 2000s, whose vision for a one-stop “financial supermarket” resulted in a disjointed group of global franchises. </p> <p>It is “a decade overdue”, said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo, who has long been critical of Citi's strategy. </p> <p>Citi will exit its retail banking franchises in China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Bahrain, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam as part of the sale. It agreed a deal to sell the Australia business in August.</p> <p>It is only a partial retreat, however. Citi will still retain its operations in Hong Kong and Singapore, its largest consumer markets in the region. The group will continue to provide wealth management services to clients across the region, and will maintain its institutional business that includes investment banking, corporate lending and treasury solutions.</p> <p>However, there are already signs that some clients in the region have been put off by the uncertainty. Investment sales in the Asia consumer bank plunged 36 per cent between April, when Citi announced the planned disposals, and the end of September.</p> <p>The move was also announced before Citi's deals team had done a significant amount of preparatory work on the finances of its banks in all of the jurisdictions, according to two people close to the process. This meant interested buyers were unable to access a “data room” that contained the figures for several months, the people said.</p> <p>It has meant a period of uncertainty for Citi's consumer banking staff in Asia. “It's been a very difficult balancing act,” said a person familiar with the sale. “Some staff are unhappy that there hasn't been enough communication, but there's confidential information that can't be shared.”</p> <p>A second person close to the bank said its “overriding priority” when reviewing bids for the Asia units was that buyers would agree to retain “as many staff as possible”.</p> <p>One senior adviser to international banks in Hong Kong said he believed that the sale was announced by Citi early in Fraser's tenure because she wanted to be seen as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf3d7b9d-ae30-43dc-9896-230323d36988\">“mover and shaker”</a> during her first weeks in charge. </p> <p>However, one of the people close to the bank attributed the long timeline to it being a “complex transaction, talking to buyers in each jurisdiction in parallel”.</p> <p>Citi declined to comment on the risk to jobs or the timeline of the sale. It said in a statement: “We are pursuing consumer franchise sales with a focus on optimal results for our people, our clients and our shareholders. Conversations with potential buyers continue with strong interest from a broad range of bidders.”</p> <p>The retreat from Asia has been welcomed by analysts and investors who have for years accused Citi of being too sprawling, while its profits and share price have lagged behind those of its rivals. </p> <p>Citi is the only US megabank that trades at less than book value. Dave Ellison a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, said: “They are just not defined as anything besides a big pile of assets . . . people own it because it's cheap.” </p> <p>The bank has struggled to meet key profitability targets since the financial crisis, including a return on tangible common equity. That metric continued to lag behind peers in the most recent quarter at 11 per cent, compared with 16 per cent at Bank of America and 22 per cent at JPMorgan.</p> <p>Citi has been pruning its global franchise in search of higher returns since the global financial crisis, with Fraser's predecessor Mike Corbat overseeing an exit from its consumer franchises in Brazil and Argentina. But the proposed Asia divestments stand out in terms of scale.</p> <p>The performance of the bank's consumer business — which is lossmaking in the Asian markets that it is exiting and provides meagre returns elsewhere — has been an issue of internal contention for years.</p> <p>Instead, Fraser is prioritising three areas where she sees the most potential for growth: transaction banking, wealth management and commercial banking. </p> <p>Citi had already been slowly pivoting to wealth management across Asia after finding limited demand for its standard banking services, such as cash withdrawals and current accounts, in those markets. </p> <p>In Australia, for example, it had been paring back its retail network and converting branches into wealth centres to refocus the business on high net worth clients. </p> <p>In August, Citi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fd2c59d-6258-4b2f-b583-cb20cbf2de1d\">sold its Australia consumer business</a> to National Australia Bank for about A$1.2bn (US$882m), but that resulted in a $680m pre-tax loss for the bank. Citi said all of the unit's 800 staff moved to NAB. </p> <p>Overall, its planned exits in the region will release about $7bn of capital over several years, according to Citi, with around $2bn of that coming from winding down its South Korea business.</p> <p>It plans to raise $150bn of new assets from its wealth clients and hire 2,300 wealth managers in Asia by 2025, many of them in China.</p> <p>Wall Street banks have stepped up plans to capture China's estimated $46tn of household savings in the past two years as Beijing has gradually increased access to its capital account. Citi was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86af4797-83db-4aa8-aba9-701277ec2c76\">first US bank</a> to win a fund custody licence in China last year.</p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong, Imani Moise in Las Vegas and Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Citi prepares for Asia retail retreat as bids for consumer businesses roll in ' FT.com 2 November.
