  "title": "Stocks Rise, But on Track to Erase August's Gains; U.S. stocks head toward end of choppy week that saw major indexes pull back from records",
  "text": "<p>Despite Friday's moves, all three indexes are headed for weekly declines, weighed down by steep losses among shares of economically-sensitive companies like banks, materials companies and energy producers.</p><p>Stocks have been knocked back this week by fears that an uptick in Covid-19 infections and a slowdown in China's growth could impede the economic recovery. New lockdowns to contain the coronavirus could put further pressure on already shaky supply chains. Worries about rising inflation levels and the Federal Reserve's signals that it will scale back some of its easy money policieshave also cut into investors' appetite for riskier assets, analysts say.</p><p>\"We're looking at a period of very strong, but also very uneven global growth over the next couple of months,\" said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The government reaction now looks very different across different parts of the world.\"</p><p>One big question weighing on investors' minds is how much inflation, which has jumped this year, will continue rising in the coming months and years.</p><p>\"If inflation does prove to be more stubborn, it could change how quickly the Fed has to tighten once they get going,\" Mr. Gimber said.</p><p>Corporate earnings drove swings among individual stocks Friday.</p><p>Foot Locker jumped 8% after the retailer, citing strong sales in its women's and kids' footwear departments, posted earnings that surged past analysts' expectations.</p><p>Ross Stores fell 3.7% after delivering an outlook that disappointed some investors.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of assets that look vulnerable to weakening economic activity extended a recent streak of declines.</p><p>U.S. crude oil slipped 0.7% to $63.04 a barrel. Oil prices have been stung this week by the strengthening of the dollar, which tends to make the commodity more expensive to holders of other currencies.</p><p>Copper prices, which are sensitive to changes in the outlook for manufacturing activity, took another leg lower as well.</p><p>As traders broadly retreated from riskier assets, the Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of expected turbulence in markets, rose to its highest level since May.</p><p>Elsewhere, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.3%. Despite stabilizing Friday, the benchmark ended with its worst weekly decline since May.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite closed down 1.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng contracted 1.8%, capping off a tumultuous week for stocksin both markets.</p><p>The selloff in Asia this week was sparked by regulators in the country stepping up their scrutiny of internet-technology companies. Several state-media commentaries and articles have also suggested that Chinese regulators plan to get tough on more industries.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise, But on Track to Erase August's Gains</p>",
