Do read on. — <em>Samuel Agini, Sports Business Reporter&#xa0;</em></p> <h1>Manchester United stumbles on to a succession plan</h1> <p>Whatever happened to <strong>Manchester United</strong>?</p> <p>Last weekend, <strong>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e951ee53-011d-42be-af45-b94d343af791\">was sacked</a>, becoming the fourth coach to fail to win the <strong>English Premier League</strong> trophy with the club since the legendary <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson </strong>retired in 2013.</p> <p>The financial imperatives behind firing Solskjaer are clear. The club, owned by the US billionaire <strong>Glazer</strong> family, hopes to return to pre-pandemic annual revenues of more than £600m this season, making it one of the richest football clubs in the world. </p> <p>Much of this income is remarkably predictable. Broadcasting rights are sold centrally by the English Premier League and <strong>Uefa, </strong>European football's governing body. United's Old Trafford stadium is sold out every match, maximising ticket and hospitality income. Sponsorship remains strong.</p> <p>The one area of financial volatility surrounds whether the team qualifies for the <strong>Champions League</strong>, Europe's most prestigious club contest in which €2bn is shared among participating clubs. A dismal run of five defeats in seven Premier League games means the club risks missing out on next season's competition.</p> <p>United's strong business was built on enormous on-field success under Ferguson. Over 26 seasons, he led the club to 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and numerous other honours. As the football industry grew over recent decades, United became one of the sport's pre-eminent brands.</p> <p>Yet, as writer <strong>Rory Smith</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/22/sports/soccer/manchester-united-ole-solskjaer.html\">put it</a> in the New York Times: “Ferguson does not seem to have left behind anyone at Old Trafford who truly understood the inner workings of his winning machine.”</p> <p>Ferguson has written a book on leadership and given lectures on the subject. Scoreboard has absorbed this literature but has also come up short of understanding his genius. </p> <p>Take this <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/10/fergusons-formula\">Harvard Business Review article</a> from 2013 by <strong>Anita Elberse</strong>, who was given extraordinary access to the great man. Most of Ferguson's “leadership lessons” — “prepare to win” or “never stop adapting” — sound like managerial guff rather than hard substance. </p> <p>Even so, one useful titbit was that Ferguson believed each successful team had a life cycle of about four years, after which time change was necessary, even if that meant transferring away established stars in favour of younger players.</p> <p>Instead of this ruthless approach, United has been trapped in nostalgia. Solskjaer was hired not as a coach with an elite record, but as a legendary ex-player. </p> <p>This summer, United brought in, at great cost, 21-year-old Jadon Sancho from <strong>Borussia Dortmund</strong>. Yet when another former United legend, 36-year-old <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> became available, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/593ab1ac-8dc7-4f2d-8f5d-e1e3437dd4c7\">the club signed him too</a>. Sancho has spent much of this season warming the bench.</p> <p>Finally, the penny has dropped. On Thursday, The Athletic was first to report that <strong>Ralf Rangnick</strong>, the German coach who once ran the <strong>Red Bull</strong> network of clubs, is to become interim United manager until the end of the season. He'll then move upstairs as a “consultant”, making way for a permanent head coach.</p> <p>This FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51719760-b6a0-4f3f-81ba-970b299f8e53\">“How to Lead” interview</a> with Rangnick from last year shows why this could represent United's savviest move since Ferguson left. As a coach, Rangnick pioneered the modern “high pressing” style of play seen at most elite sides. But he's also adept in a sporting director role, working above the coaching staff to locate undervalued players in the transfer market and improve youth academies.</p> <p>United has long needed to separate the running of its business operations from the football side of the club. Rangnick might just be the visionary leader to enact such change.</p> <h1>The Olympics' China problem</h1> <p>Earlier this month, Chinese tennis star <strong>Peng Shuai</strong> alleged on her verified <strong>Weibo</strong> account that a former high-ranking government official, <strong>Zhang Gaoli</strong>, sexually assaulted her. The post — and its swift deletion — has sparked a firestorm of criticism, from the <strong>Women's Tennis Association</strong> to the <strong>White House</strong>.</p> <p>It is just one troubling example of deepening divisions between China and the US (see also: <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> chief executive <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>‘s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ee3fad6-957d-4410-b5a7-9421ea131e51\">hasty apology</a> on Wednesday for a remark about the Communist party).&#xa0;</p> <p>But the case has highlighted the supposed diplomatic powers of the <strong>International Olympic Committee</strong>, whose 2022 Winter Games are set to kick off in Beijing just over two months from now.</p> <p>On Sunday, the IOC said its president, <strong>Thomas Bach</strong>, had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89ccbcd3-39b3-4cb4-ba32-324fd7a6a852\">hosted a video call</a> with Peng. It was the first public claim by a non-Chinese entity to have made contact with the tennis pro since she published her allegations on November 2. </p> <p>In a statement, the IOC said Peng was “safe and well” at her home in Beijing, and that Bach has arranged to meet her for dinner there in January.</p> <p>It would be a stretch to say the Olympics is apolitical. From Berlin 1936 to as recently as Tokyo 2020, governments around the world have used staging the Games as an occasion to legitimise political parties or herald new economic beginnings. </p> <p>Hosting a private call with Peng ends the pretence of the IOC as a neutral power broker. The IOC has described its approach as “quiet diplomacy”. A person familiar with the matter points to the promise of a Beijing dinner between Bach and Peng as a forward-looking plan to ensure accountability by the Chinese as to her safety and wellbeing. </p> <p>The call did little to quell concern by the US-based WTA, which has threatened to pull its tournaments from China, nor human rights groups, which say the Peng case <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b81387f4-8055-486a-a514-8c6d5f717744\">could be a tipping point</a> in Chinese and western corporate relations.</p> <p>Previous pre-Olympics human rights concerns have not been assuaged by the staging of a Games. </p> <p>Russia passed a law in 2013 against promoting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71eaa49e-0580-11e3-8ed5-00144feab7de\">“homosexual propaganda</a>” to minors, drawing outcry from human rights groups and eventually leading to diplomatic boycotts of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Still, the Games went ahead. Broadcasters and sponsors, which bankroll the IOC, received the product they paid for. Russia's law — and persecution of some LGBTQ groups — remains in effect. </p> <p>The IOC has a vested financial interest in ensuring the Games go on. But taking the lead on ascertaining Peng's whereabouts shouldn't be quiet diplomacy, but an active responsibility.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The UK government backed the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b99cfa0-7fd6-4cb8-ba19-83c631882137\">creation of a regulator</a> for English football, following a review by ex-sports minister <strong>Tracey Crouch</strong>. She recommended an independent body be given strong powers to block club takeovers and impose a redistributive levy on Premier League player transfers. If enacted, the changes would represent the biggest changes to the running of the game in decades.</p></li>  <li><p>Two Norwegian journalists <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/norway-criticises-qatar-over-arrest-norwegian-journalists-2021-11-24/\">were arrested</a> in Qatar while on a trip to report on preparations for the football World Cup, which is less than a year away. <strong>Jonas Gahr Stoere</strong>, prime minister of Norway, said the arrests were “unacceptable”. The duo returned to Oslo after being released.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>John Henry's Fenway Sports Group</strong>, the owner of football side <strong>Liverpool</strong> and the <strong>Boston Red Sox </strong>baseball team, has<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/red-sox-fenway-sports-owner-nba-0557a995-028f-49c5-8d90-90dc2d17e184.html\"> set its sights</a> on acquiring a team in the <strong>National Basketball Association </strong>once it completes its $875m takeover of the <strong>Pittsburgh Penguins </strong>of the <strong>National Hockey League</strong>, as the company builds a collection of famous sporting brands.</p></li>  <li><p>Spain's <strong>National Securities Market Commission</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ebf5176-a0b6-4370-866b-103de0389004#\">chided</a> former World Cup-winning football player <strong>Andrés Iniesta</strong> for promoting <strong>Binance</strong>, the cryptocurrency exchange, on Twitter, a sign that regulators are watching the deepening relationship between sport and risky digital assets.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>ITV</strong>, the British broadcaster, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/722ffdb3-feac-4331-9ce0-18185775831f\">has informed</a> UK horseracing chiefs that it is keen on renewing its contract to screen the sport, as it looks to secure the lucrative advertising revenues drawn from bookmakers.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <p>Liverpool midfielder <strong>Thiago Alcântara's</strong> sumptuous goal (which you can see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1463617514437545998?s=21\">here</a> or in GIF form <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dantunna/status/1463628840304095232?s=21\">here</a>) was reminiscent of a stone skimming across water. Which, in turn, reminded us that even that can be a professional sport. Of sorts. Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=lOClr_XfhDo\">highlights</a> from this year's <strong>Stone Skipping Championships</strong> in Pennsylvania, screened on <strong>ESPN</strong> and won by <strong>David “Spider-Man” Ohmer</strong>. And if that's not enough, there's even a video analysing <strong>Kurt Steiner</strong>'s world record of 88 stone skips in a single throw <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1KfuErAcj0\">here</a>.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Manchester United's succession plan' FT.com 27 November.
