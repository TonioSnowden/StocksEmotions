  "title": "JPMorgan to Buy Restaurant-Discovery Service the Infatuation; Deal is the bank's latest effort to cater to big spenders who like to travel and dine out",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan is buying all of The Infatuation's business, including the decades-old restaurant brand Zagat, the person said. The Infatuation purchased Zagat from Alphabet Inc.'s Google for an undisclosed amount in 2018, the same year it raised $30 million from WndrCo, a technology and media investment firm co-founded by Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p><p>Banks don't usually buy media companies. But JPMorgan has made a push to attract big spenders who like to travel and dine out, particularly through credit-card rewards. Last year, the bank rolled out Chase Dining in its Ultimate Rewards portal, which gives certain cardholders access to hard-to-get dining reservations and other perks. Sapphire Reserve and Preferred cardholders get access to virtual events with chefs, mixologists and restaurateurs.</p><p>Founded in 2009 by record executives Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, the Infatuation has grown from a scrappy review site known for its branded Instagram hashtag (\"#Eeeeeats\") to a global tastemaker in the world of cuisine.</p><p>JPMorgan plans to give some of its customers, including credit-card holders, special access to the Infatuation's curated experiences, like Eeeeeatscon, and to certain content on its website. Mr. Stang will continue to run the business, which will operate as a separate brand within the bank.</p><p>The Infatuation doesn't disclose its finances, including whether it is profitable. The company was exploring options including raising funds in recent months, according to a person familiar with the matter, and ultimately opted for an outright sale of the business.</p><p>Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com and Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan to Buy Restaurant-Discovery Service the Infatuation</p>",
