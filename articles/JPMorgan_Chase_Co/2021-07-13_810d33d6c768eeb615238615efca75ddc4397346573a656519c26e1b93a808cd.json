  "text": "<p>The Biden administration will this week warn US companies of the increasing risks of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ca8fbfb-10ad-47f3-a755-e975589e7e41\">operating in Hong Kong</a> as China asserts greater control over the financial hub.</p> <p>According to three people familiar with the message, those threats include the Chinese government's ability to gain access to data that foreign companies store in Hong Kong and a new law that allows Beijing to impose sanctions against anyone that enables foreign penalties to be implemented against Chinese groups and officials.</p> <p>President Joe Biden is planning to issue the warning and impose more sanctions in response to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44a466a5-70ea-46ff-91b2-eec36684ba3c\">Beijing's crackdown</a> on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdfbd758-a91b-47b3-accf-37f202429936\">genocide</a> the US has accused Beijing of committing against Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang.</p> <p>Later today, the US will update a warning that the Trump administration issued on Xinjiang last year, according to five people familiar with the decision.</p> <p>The advisory will stress the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b81764f4-be52-4448-82b9-a9f3348a1e64\">legal risks</a>&#xa0;that US companies face unless they ensure that their supply chains are not implicated in forced labour in Xinjiang.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Lagarde braced for ECB split</strong> European Central Bank unity on its inflation target could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11e953df-536b-43aa-9c21-65b8dd79c797\">dissolve into division</a> as early as next week when policymakers meet to discuss&#xa0;changing its guidance on raising interest rates, president Christine Lagarde warned in an interview with the FT.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>In other central bank news:</strong> The Bank of England has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb4d5ff9-e2a3-48a4-abb5-3b0b5a14a757\">removed restrictions</a> on bank dividends and share buybacks imposed during the pandemic.

While loan growth has languished during the pandemic, executives have pointed to eye-popping gains in fee-generating trading and investment banking businesses in recent weeks.</p> <p><strong>Inflation data </strong>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to confirm that US consumer prices moderated last month. A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/234a9b90-e4f6-4b59-9e39-c6e34ac78276\">consensus forecast</a>, compiled by Bloomberg, showed the consumer price index is expected to rise 4.9 per cent in June from a year ago — slightly below the nearly 13-year high of 5 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d9a5ae5-43fe-4f18-be49-b907a9c3a5e0\">reported</a> in May.&#xa0; </p> <p><strong>Biden to seek public support for voting-rights push</strong> In a major speech in Philadelphia&#xa0;today, the US president will seek to drum up public support against what the White House described as an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a0a5f45-c608-4ac5-affc-e4bb2fdf14d8\">“onslaught of voter suppression laws”</a> in Republican states. </p> <p><strong>Tory rebellion </strong>Boris Johnson faces possible defeat in the UK parliament today on a vote to reverse a proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/965cb49b-0e47-4f98-89be-231e1f50e65c\">£4bn of cuts</a> to Britain's annual aid spending. The Conservative party rebels include former prime minister Theresa May.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Sovereign debt profits vs human rights </strong>Divestment campaigns are not new in emerging markets investing. But they have been given impetus by the phenomenon of ESG investing sweeping the industry, as activists demand that asset managers <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/bd2e752e-5afa-424a-af7e-433963dd7c34\">stop supporting regimes</a> that abuse their own citizens.</p> <ul>  <li><p>As US investment groups rush into mergers, European rivals face mounting pressure to respond.

But combining everything from commodities to venture capital in one gauge — <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/9a9056e1-b35e-4ea7-b9f7-7668c07469ed\">an “ultimate index”</a> — has proven elusive, writes Robin Wigglesworth.</p> <p><strong>Afghan warlords mobilise to counter Taliban onslaught</strong> In 2001, the US teamed up with the Northern Alliance, a coalition of Afghan militia leaders, to drive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e8a7a6d-6228-43ca-bf63-16d3371ff897\">the Taliban out of Kabul</a>. Two decades later, the warlords are calling for a “second resistance” against the Islamist onslaught.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion:</strong> I still happen to think withdrawal — even after decades of failed attempts to get the Afghan government and armed forces to stand on their own — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8277a140-236d-4d7d-9b8e-82459c72ee7e\">is a mistake</a>, writes the FT's US managing editor Peter Spiegel who reported from Afghanistan two decades ago. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>The next generation of Palestinian activists </strong>The social media and real-life advocacy exemplified by Mohammed and Muna al-Kurd exemplifies an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b321e326-2feb-4d12-96e9-d15348cab3a8\">emerging Palestinian movement</a> that is uniting young activists from the occupied territories with Arab Israeli citizens who live inside Israel's 1948 borders.</p> <p><strong>The face of a changing Tibet </strong>“My wife and I might be among the last of the nomads here,” said a man in Ladakh, on the border of China and India. Many fear the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/travel/tibetan-culture.html\">loss of traditional Tibetan culture</a> as its people face political suppression, technological advances and climate change.
