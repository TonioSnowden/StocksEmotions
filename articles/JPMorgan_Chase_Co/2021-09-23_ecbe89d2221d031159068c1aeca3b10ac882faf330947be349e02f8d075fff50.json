  "text": "<p>Happy days for <strong>Deloitte's</strong> UK partners. </p> <p>They are set to receive an average payout of about £1m each after profits at the Big Four firm rebounded from pandemic lows. That will be the highest profit share in more than a decade, accountancy correspondent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bb6e574-cd21-48fb-8660-7b93e4bf489b\">Michael O'Dwyer reports</a>. </p> <p>Last year's average profit share was only around £731,000, down from 2019's £882,000. This year's figure would be lower than 2019's, according to people familiar with the results, were it not for an additional payout of around £200,000 from the firm's sale of its UK restructuring arm to private equity-backed Teneo. </p> <p>More <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bb6e574-cd21-48fb-8660-7b93e4bf489b\">here</a>. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>AstraZeneca </strong>has struck its first RNA deal, entering into a partnership with <strong>VaxEquity</strong> that will use the technology that first proved itself with the Covid-19 vaccines, our correspondent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6cd548-9e8c-4e67-a819-a4c14b5b53fc\">Hannah Kuchler reports</a>. </p> <p><strong>Oxford Nanopore </strong>is on course for a valuation of between around £3bn and £3.5bn when it lists early next month, raising the company and existing shareholders up to £476m (excluding greenshoe) in its highly-anticipated IPO. The genomics company announced last week it had secured a £150m cornerstone investment from <strong>Oracle</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Royal Mail </strong>reckons we're approaching a new normal as far as parcel delivery is concerned. Chair <strong>Keith Williams</strong> said the group was “increasingly confident domestic parcels are rebasing at a significantly higher level than pre-Covid and believe we are maintaining our share of the market”. Parcel volumes are lower than last year (though revenues are higher), but domestic volumes are up by about a third on pre-pandemic levels. Unsurprisingly, Royal Mail does anticipate some cost pressures, though. </p> <p><strong>John Lewis Partnership</strong> meanwhile finds itself in hot water with its workforce over bonuses. Last September the partnership scrapped its annual “partnership bonus”, a percentage of salary paid each March to all staff dependent on group financial performance, for the first time since 1953. But now it's emerged the group made almost 4,000 “special contribution” awards, with some of those going to directors and heads of department (though none to the executive team). Shop floor workers are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/563293c3-eb0d-49c6-8901-7b12556f44f5\">not happy</a>. </p> <p><strong>Drax</strong>, the FTSE 250 electricity company, has said it could keep its coal-fired power plants burning beyond their planned closure next year to plug an energy supply gap. The group's CEO Will Gardiner stopped short of saying it would run its coal plants at full capacity through winter, but indicated it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3fb3e96-713b-41da-8ab6-3b582940d97c\">considering all options</a> and could respond to government requests.</p> <p>Also out today are results from <strong>DFS. Reckitt</strong> has an update out: it said recent trading has been in line with expectations. Pub group <strong>Fullers</strong> reported like-for-like sales at 86 per cent of 2019 levels in the seven weeks to September 18, while rival <strong>Mitchell &amp; Butlers </strong>said sales in the past eight weeks had been higher than pre-pandemic levels. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>It's <strong>Evergrande</strong> debt deadline day. If the Chinese property developer fails to make an interest payment today on one of its offshore dollar bonds, it could spark the country's biggest ever debt restructuring. Yields on dollar-denominated bonds issued by riskier Asian borrowers have already soared to almost 12 per cent this week, as the crisis at Evergrande spreads to other assets. Our correspondents Thomas Hale and Hudson Lockett explain the latest developments <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ac2d661-5a63-4768-91a1-182f02b2afa5\">here</a>, but if you want a comprehensive catch-up on the whole saga, read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea1b79bf-cbe3-41d9-91da-0a1ba692309f\">this</a> from our global China editor James Kynge. </p> <p><strong>Facebook's</strong> chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad123117-483c-40e0-ad25-99a77ee80c6d\">stepping down</a>, the latest high-profile departure from the social media company. Facebook is battling its biggest public relations crisis since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, after The Wall Street Journal published a series of damning reports that allege serious content moderation failures at the company and suggest it routinely buried internal research if the findings proved negative. Facebook has largely denied the claims, accusing the Journal of “mischaracterising” the company's work.</p> <p>Retail stock brokerage <strong>Robinhood </strong>is starting offering crypto wallets on its platform, putting it in direct competition with more established digital currency venues such as Coinbase. That will mean customers can directly own and transfer cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to pay for goods and services, rather than simply trade them as they do now. More from Madison Darbyshire in New York <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44a7b9b1-d658-4c2a-bbf3-34af30aeaa8b\">here</a>. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas <br></strong>A nimble, digital neobank has arrived on the UK banking scene. It has a $3tn balance sheet, and it's JPMorgan Chase. That will increase the digital squeeze on UK retail banks. But Helen argues the real problem legacy banks face is that everyone — whether digital-only or full service — is now competing for the same customers. Her excellent column is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0380747-7a6c-4dfc-9cfe-f7aa48023fea\">here</a>. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Deloitte UK partners' £1m payday' FT.com 23 September.
