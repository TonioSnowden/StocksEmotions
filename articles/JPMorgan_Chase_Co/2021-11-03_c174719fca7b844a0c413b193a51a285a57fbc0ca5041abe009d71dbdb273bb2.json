Investors were prepared for the Fed to start dialing back its bond purchases and were focused on how the Fed approached rising prices. Mr. Powell put greater emphasis on the uncertainty facing the outlook for inflation and the Fed's statement described high inflation as \"largely reflecting transitory factors.\"</p><p>\"It was more dovish than markets expected,\" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, of the outcome and press conference. \"Anytime there's a whiff of lower rates, we tend to get favorable market reactions.\"</p><p>Low interest rates have been a boost for growth stocks, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed its peers and finished its longest winning streak since 2020.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.577%, up from 1.546% on Tuesday.
