  "text": "<p>Circle has raised $1.1 billion overall, according to Crunchbase. The company is planning to go public through a special purpose acquisition corporation later this year.</p><p>The USD Coin, or USDC, has become the second-largest stablecoin, with about $51 billion in circulation. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to trade on par with national currencies like the U.S. dollar and backed by matching reserves.</p><p>During a conference call Wednesday morning, Mr. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, said BlackRock has been working with Circle over the past year as a manager of some of Circle's cash reserves. He expects BlackRock eventually to be the primary manager of those reserves.</p><p>\"We look forward to expanding our relationship,\" he said.</p><p>BlackRock has over $9 trillion in assets under management.</p><p>Mr. Fink said the firm is also studying the crypto sector broadly, including assets, stablecoins, permissioned blockchains and \"tokenization,\" where it perceives a benefit to its customers. \"We are increasingly seeing interest from our clients,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Fink's name came up last week during the Miami 2022 bitcoin conference.</p><p>Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder who has become a vocal bitcoin booster, delivered a speech in which he advocated developing an \"enemies list\" of people opposed to bitcoin. He singled out Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Warren Buffett, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Mr. Fink.</p><p>In a letter to investors last month, Mr. Fink said a well-designed digital-money system could cut cross-border costs, improve global-transactions settlements and help cut down money laundering.</p><p>Write to Paul Vigna at Paul.Vigna@wsj.com</p><p>Larry Fink Says BlackRock Is Studying Cryptocurrencies</p>",
