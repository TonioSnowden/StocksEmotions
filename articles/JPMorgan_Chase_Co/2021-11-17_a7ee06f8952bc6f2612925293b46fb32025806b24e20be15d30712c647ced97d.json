  "title": "Shoppers Increase Spending, Despite Inflation --- Retail sales rose by 1.7% in October as consumers bucked the pandemic, higher prices",
  "text": "<p>The elevated spending level suggests solid holiday sales this season, lifting the economy as a whole. J.P. Morgan said it was upgrading its growth expectations, raising its forecast for fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product to 5% from 4%.</p><p>U.S. stocks rose after the report, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.4%, reversing Monday's declines, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding nearly 0.2%, or 54.77 points.</p><p>Spending rose sharply, by 4%, at online retailers, along with big gains at electronics, appliance and hardware stores. Grocery-store sales rose by 1.1% while restaurant and bar sales were flat. Gas stations, where sales rose 3.9%, and auto dealerships, with a 1.8% gain, also showed strength.</p><p>Retailers are raising expectations for their holiday hauls. Walmart Inc. on Tuesday reported higher sales in the third quarter, saying it increased prices as more consumers shopped early for the holidays. The retailer said U.S. inventory rose as it prepares for \"an expected strong holiday season.\" Home Depot Inc. said its third-quarter results were better than expected.</p><p>\"Consumers say they're pessimistic -- we have had very high inflation -- but the truth is they're in very good shape right now,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. As reasons for the robust demand for goods he cited the roughly $2 trillion in excess savings that households have accrued since the start of the pandemic, as well as low interest rates and an improving labor market.</p><p>Core retail sales, a measure that excludes spending on autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, were up 1.6%, showing that consumers increased discretionary spending in addition to taking on higher prices for necessary goods. Spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores was up 1.5% and rose by 2.2% at department stores. Pharmacies and clothing stores both saw modest declines.</p><p>The combination of strong demand, snarled supply chains, higher prices and an unbalanced labor market is making for an unusual holiday season where record sales might be accompanied by shortages and long waits for goods. Inflation might also start to cut into demand for consumers with lower incomes, economists said.</p><p>Norm Bruce, who with his wife, Eve, owns Martha Merrell's Books and Toys in Waukesha, Wis., said he expected strong holiday sales. A winter farmers market they set up in front of their Main Street store was a success the first weekend of November, and they plan to continue the weekly event. But supply-chain issues and rising prices are taking their toll.</p><p>\"We're telling our customers right now, if you see it, buy it. We don't have 10 or 20 copies of a book right now, we have maybe 1 or 2,\" Mr. Bruce said.</p><p>Most books have prices printed directly on the jacket, preventing Mr. Bruce from charging more. But the store has had to raise prices on some other items.</p><p>\"All of a sudden, I was having to put increases of $4 or $5 on stuffed animals, because the shipping cost has gone up tremendously,\" Mr. Bruce said. \"Consumers right now are very forgiving, but when the prices start going up, they say, 'That's a stuffed dog, I don't want to pay that much.' \"</p><p>Retail-sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation, so some of the increase can be attributed to higher prices.</p><p>The backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing. Containers can wait weeks before they are picked up by trucking companies, which said they can't find enough drivers.</p><p>The resulting inflation, if left unchecked, could start eating into consumers' budgets enough to tamp down on demand for goods, Mr. Faucher said. But there are strong incentives for retailers to get their supply chains sorted out.</p><p>\"If you can find out how to get your product to consumers when they're having trouble finding things, you're going to make a lot of money,\" he said.</p><p>Companies attempting to get ahead of the holiday crush might have simply moved it forward by a few weeks, according to a study by Panjiva, a research unit of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Online shopping has dominated the early days of the holiday rush, but that is expected to shift to in-store shopping as customers try to avoid shipping delays. And some gift-givers might choose to opt out of material gifts.</p><p>\"Gift card and digital e-gift card sales have also been trending up recently, which could continue to be a theme through the holidays,\" said Felipe Chacon, an economist at payments company Square.</p><p>Labor shortages are also contributing to price increases.</p><p>Maureen Craig, who owns the Southern Cajun-Creole restaurant Alligator Soul in Savannah, Ga., said the main thing preventing her from having her best year ever is inability to find enough staff.</p><p>\"It's been very, very difficult to hire -- more in the kitchen than in the front of the house,\" Ms. Craig said. She recently decided to close the restaurant on Sundays to alleviate some of the pressure on her chef and kitchen staff. Customers have taken it in stride.</p><p>\"Everyone understands it's an impossible time right now,\" she said. \"I don't want to sacrifice their experience for the almighty dollar.\"</p>",
