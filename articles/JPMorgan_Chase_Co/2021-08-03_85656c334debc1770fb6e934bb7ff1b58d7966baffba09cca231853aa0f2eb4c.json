  "title": "Slow Outlook for Europe Pushes Down Bond Yields",
  "text": "<p>The move partly mirrors the action in the U.S. bond market, where the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury note has retreated from a peak of 1.749% at the end of March. It settled Monday at 1.173%, its lowest close since February.</p><p>In Europe, investors' appetite for sovereign debt has picked up as the outlook for the region has dimmed. The spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus is prompting worries that governments could broaden restrictions. Europe has also long struggled to kick-start inflation, prompting some money managers to bet that the European Central Bank will continue to buy bonds and keep interest rates low even after other major central banks scale back easy-money policies.</p><p>\"If we get additional easing out of the ECB, then it should be supportive for European bonds,\" said Iain Stealey, chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"It's very different to other central banks around the world -- such as in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.K. -- where inflation is expected to pick up and they are talking about the need to normalize.\" He favors holding German government bonds, and is betting that U.S. Treasurys will lose value.</p><p>The ECB on July 22 signaled that it is likely to keep its key interest rate, currently set at minus 0.5%, low for longer. ECB President Christine Lagarde said rising Covid-19 cases could weigh on the region's crucial tourism and hospitality industries.</p><p>The eurozone economy isn't expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels until next year, unlike the U.S., where it is already bigger than it was before the pandemic recession.</p><p>Federal Reserve policy makers last week said U.S. economic activity and employment levels had strengthened, prompting speculation that the central bank could announce plans to start reducing bond purchases later in 2021.</p><p>\"The U.S. is certainly going to taper in the next six months,\" said Andrew Mulliner, a fixed income portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. In contrast, the ECB is \"a central bank that's very unlikely to raise rates anytime soon.\"</p><p>Europe faces a tougher challenge in stoking inflation: Countries in the north tend to worry about policies that might fuel price pressures, and those in Southern Europe are more concerned about weak growth. While ECB officials have committed to not raising the key rate until inflation stabilizes at the bank's target of 2%, most investors don't expect a significant change in policies to drive inflation higher because of that tension.</p><p>The troubled outlook for Europe is prompting investors to buy more government debt, viewed as among the safest assets during uncertain times.</p><p>The ECB has sucked up much available debt through its bond-buying programs since the start of the pandemic, reducing the supply for smaller buyers. Since March, the central bank has ramped up purchases even more.</p><p>Investors expect the central bank to keep buying bonds even when its emergency support program ends as early as March. Riskier corners of the European debt market are benefiting because of this: The yield on 10-year debt issued by Greece, considered among the bloc's weakest economies, fell Monday to around its all-time closing low of 0.567%.</p>",
