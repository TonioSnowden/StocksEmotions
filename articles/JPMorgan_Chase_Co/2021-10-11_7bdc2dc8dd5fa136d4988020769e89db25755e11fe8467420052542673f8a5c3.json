  "title": "Stocks Fall As Oil Rallies; Futures for Brent crude oil rise to near their highest level in three years",
  "text": "<p>Futures for Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 1.8% to $83.89 a barrel, near their highest level in three years. The rally boosted stocks such as oilfield-services giant Halliburton, whose shares gained 3.1%.</p><p>Crude prices have climbed in recent weeks on the back of aworld-wide shortage of natural gas, raising expectations that some power plants could switch their fuel from gas to oil as winter approaches.</p><p>Gains in industrial metals lifted mining stocks. Freeport-McMoRan surged 4.2%, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Copper futures in New York rose more than 2% to about $4.37 a pound.</p><p>The energy and materials sectors could have more room to rally due to commodity-driven price inflation and investor appetite for cyclical stocks that would benefit from a broad economic recovery, said Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research.</p><p>\"They're still a relatively small part of the S&amp;P 500, so if dollars continue to chase those stocks, it could put upward pressure on their share prices,\" Mr. Senyek said.</p><p>Investors are also looking ahead to third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off this week. As inflation has proved stickier than expected—brought on by supply-chain disruptions, labor shortages and surging energy prices—corporate earnings could shed light on how such price increases are impacting U.S. companies.</p><p>No major earnings are due Monday. Companies set to report later in the week include Delta Air Lines, Domino's Pizza and JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 3% from its record close of early September. Stocks have been volatile in recent weeks amid concerns about inflation, a slowdown in the pace of economic growth and fallout from the Delta variant of Covid-19.</p><p>\"If it wasn't for the huge amount of savings people are sitting on from the pandemic, I'd be more worried,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The obvious risk to that is winter. I don't think anyone knows if that will lead to another pickup in cases and hospitalizations.\"</p><p>U.S. bond markets were closed on Monday for afederal holiday.</p><p>Bitcoin added to recent gains, rising more than 6% from its Friday 5 p.m. ET level to $57,507. Speculation has been mounting that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund in coming weeks, which could increase the number of firms able to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up less than 0.1%. The U.K's FTSE 100 jumped 0.7%, led by gains in energy and mining companies.</p><p>Stocks in Asia were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed about 2%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.6%. In mainland China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite was roughly flat.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich atalexo@wsj.com.</p><p>Stocks Fall As Oil Rallies</p>",
