  "title": "Exodus From Midtown Manhattan Led by Tech and Banks; New buildings in trendy neighborhoods downtown and on the West Side are luring companies from the corporate corridors of older, staid offices",
  "text": "<p>Many businesses today—and their employees—are also increasingly concerned about their offices' carbon footprint. Newer buildings are constructed with energy use in mind, while renovating older buildings to reduce their carbon emissions requires a significant investment, developers say.</p><p>The result: More companies are shunning the older, staid office buildings that line the avenues of corporate Midtown for developing neighborhoods across town.</p><p>Big tech companies are leading the charge. Alphabet Inc.'s Google paid $2.1 billion for its headquarters downtown near the Hudson River, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. now occupies four buildings south of Midtown.</p><p>A number of financial firms, long pillars of Midtown corridors, are abandoning the area for more modern business districts. HSBC Bank USA N.A. said this month it is moving from its Fifth Avenue office to a new complex in Hudson Yards, following in the footsteps of investment firm KKR &amp; Co. and hedge-fund firm Point72 Asset Management.</p><p>The migration away from Midtown has been accelerating for years and picked up fresh momentum during the pandemic. It reached a new milestone this spring, when asking rents in Midtown South surpassed Midtown for the first time on record, according to real-estate firm Colliers. It defines Midtown South as neighborhoods south of Bryant Park and north of Canal Street, including the Hudson Yards development on the far west side and the Flatiron and Chelsea neighborhoods south of Grand Central and Times Square.</p><p>At the end of April, Midtown South had a 2.5% asking-rent premium over the Midtown market, according to Colliers. </p><p>Proximity to the transportation hub at Grand Central made Midtown an appealing location.

Alvarado Jr. for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The city's Midtown district, which is generally defined as the area between Bryant Park and Central Park, rose to prominence in the postwar era, as technological advancements allowed financial firms to move away from the stock exchange on Wall Street and executives sought newer buildings, some with views of Central Park, near transportation hubs such as Grand Central and residential neighborhoods on the Upper East Side, said Frank Wallach, a Colliers executive managing director of research.</p><p>Midtown was the undisputed center of New York's office market for about 50 years, until the late 1990s and early 2000s, when tech companies started opening offices further south. The movement picked up steam in 2011 when publisher Condé Nast said it would relocate from Times Square to the newly opened World Trade Center, Mr. Wallach said.</p><p>Some companies are sticking with the neighborhood, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which is building a 1,388-foot skyscraper on Park Avenue. And some landlords are sinking millions into renovating their older office buildings.</p><p>Other financial firms are moving west. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. left Midtown offices for Hudson Yards when it got the opportunity to buy half-a-million square feet of office space in the new mega development. The bank now operates out of a building where workers scan their palms to operate the elevators.</p><p>The large, open floors have floor-to-ceiling windows that let in lots of natural light and overlook the Hudson River. Landlords need to offer these types of features in buildings that are well located near public transportation to attract top tenants, said Michael Kaczynski, head of the bank's Real Estate Banking Northeast team.</p><p>Meta Platforms is also settling into new offices at Hudson Yards, one of four buildings it occupies south of Midtown. Meta chose Hudson Yards because of its proximity to transportation and easy accessibility to its other locations, said Becca Foy, Facebook's global business director and head of office.</p><p>The company is experimenting with \"desk hoteling\"—in which workers store goods in company lockers and reserve an open, unassigned desk, when needed—and other features that allow employees to move easily between buildings with the aim of creating an \"urban campus\" in New York.</p><p>New York office occupancy is still below 40% of prepandemic levels, according to keycard swipes tracked by security company Kastle Systems. With many Midtown offices still empty, small businesses that rely on office workers are gravitating toward other neighborhoods.</p><p>Abraham Chehebar, chief executive of Miami-based Carrot Express, said he always assumed his first New York location would open in Midtown, which historically has been the highest-grossing neighborhood for fast-casual restaurants because of the large office-worker lunch crowds.</p><p>But after the pandemic hit and offices emptied out, he shifted his sights to the Flatiron district, where he hoped to attract a mix of residential customers, office workers and tourists. His restaurant opened two months ago and is one of the top-performing stores in his chain, which counts 16 locations in South Florida.</p><p>\"We decided to go for something that had everything, which was Flatiron,\" Mr. Chehebar said. \"So far, it's going very well.\"</p><p>Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com</p><p>Exodus From Midtown Manhattan Led by Tech and Banks</p>",
