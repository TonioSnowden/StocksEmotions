  "title": "World News: Chinese Data On Economy Gets Scarce",
  "text": "<p>The moves, which economists said had no obvious precedent in China, came as China holds a Communist Party congress where leader Xi Jinping is expected to secure a third term. They were only the most glaring examples of what many investors and scholars say reflects increasing sensitivities around economic data and commentary that have made analysis of the world's second-largest economy more difficult.</p><p>In the past year, China's official statistics bureau and private research firms have retracted or removed more data from public access, while reports by economists and market analysts -- particularly those with a more bearish outlook -- have been retracted or expunged. Some analysts who have questioned economic policy have had their social-media accounts suspended.</p><p>And in recent weeks, China's securities regulator has urged brokerage firms, including the domestic Chinese businesses of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to refrain from commenting ahead of the Communist Party conclave on politically sensitive topics, which could include a range of subjects, including many aspects of the economy.</p><p>\"For investors, there is a lot of guesswork involved now,\" says Hao Hong, a prominent Hong Kong-based market strategist who left Chinese state-owned Bocom International Holdings Co. and had his Chinese social-media accounts suspended in May after he offered a bearish take on China's economy and stock-market outlook. The bank said at the time that he left for personal reasons. Mr. Hong declined to comment on his departure.</p><p>The integrity of economic data in China has long been a question mark for investors and economists. Official figures offer limited transparency into the labor market and the amount of local governments' off-balance-sheet debt, for example.</p><p>China's data-security law adopted last year has made it harder for foreign companies and investors to get information about Chinese-based firms. Hedge funds and other investors have turned to private data suppliers, satellite imagery and other increasingly obscure alternative data sources in hopes of getting a better grasp of the economic situation.</p><p>Concerns about access to accurate economic indicators and independent analysis have only grown as the slowdown has deepened in the run-up to this week's Communist Party congress. Much of the data highlights weaknesses in the Chinese economy, which has suffered from a slump in the property sector and Covid-19 policies that have stifled consumer spending and investment.</p><p>The Chinese monthly export data that had been slated for release last week was expected to have shown export growth slowing to its lowest rate in five months, according to The Wall Street Journal's poll of economists.</p><p>Similarly, data scheduled for Tuesday was expected to show that GDP growth slowed. Economists polled by the Journal estimate it grew 3.5% in the third quarter, making hitting the official growth target of around 5.5% for the year even less likely.</p><p>One area of focus for economists and investors is China's housing sector, which has come under intense strain since Beijing began enforcing strict limits on property developer debt. In August, Beijing-based Beike Research Institute, which regularly publishes reports on China's real-estate market, pegged the average residential vacancy rate in 28 Chinese cities at 12.1%. Though the level was far lower than in earlier scholarly estimates, Beike described the vacancy rate as being \"relatively high,\" exceeding that of the U.S. and U.K.</p><p>Within days, Beike retracted the report and apologized for what it called an \"incomprehensive\" survey that had employed \"nonstandardized\" sampling methods. A representative of Beike, a subsidiary of New York-listed KE Holdings Inc., declined to comment.</p>",
