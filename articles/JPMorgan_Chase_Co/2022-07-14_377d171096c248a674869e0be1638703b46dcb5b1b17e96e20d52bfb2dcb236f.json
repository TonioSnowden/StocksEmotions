  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reported a 28% decline in its second-quarter profit Thursday.</p><p>The nation's biggest bank set aside another $428 million to cover potential future loan losses, a signal it has grown more dour on the U.S. economic outlook.</p><p>That dragged down profit, which fell to $8.65 billion or $2.76 per share, falling short of the $2.89 per share forecast by analysts surveyed by FactSet.</p><p>A year ago, the bank pulled $3 billion out of its loan-loss reserves due to the economy's rapid recovery from the pandemic, pushing up profit to $11.95 billion, or $3.78 per share.</p><p>Revenue rose 1% to $30.72 billion. That missed the $31.81 billion analysts had expected.</p><p>Consumers increased spending on JPMorgan credit cards and kept paying their bills on time, even as the bank moved to prepare for potential future losses. Market volatility created a boon for trading operations, but dried up the advisory fees for initial public offerings and big deals. Increased interest rates meant its profitability on lending increased, but mortgage underwriting plunged.</p><p>The unusual atmosphere has created a divide in the economic views of bank executives, putting an extra spotlight on this season's earnings reports. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has said he saw an \"economic hurricane\" on the horizon, but he wasn't sure how serious it was.</p><p>In the consumer bank, revenue fell 1% and profit dropped 45%.</p><p>In the corporate and investment bank, revenue fell 10% while profit dropped 26%.</p><p>Revenue increased 8% in the commercial bank and 5% in asset and wealth management.</p><p>Total loans increased 6% and were more profitable. The Federal Reserve raised rates by half a percentage point in May, and another 0.75 point in June. Another hike is expected this month. That allows banks to charge more interest on loans even as they are slow to increase the rate they pay on deposits.</p><p>The bank's net interest margin, a measure of what it collects on loans minus what it pays for deposits, rose to 1.80% from 1.67% at the end of March.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>JPMorgan's Profit Drops 28%</p>",
