  "text": "<p>Mr. Scharf earned $20.3 million for 2020, a 12% pay cut from the prior year, as the coronavirus shut down the economy, weighing on the bank's profits and shares. But both rebounded last year, with Wells Fargo's share price surging 59%.</p><p>The bank is still recovering from its fake-accounts scandal that tarnished its reputation and put it in hot water with regulators. Mr. Scharf was brought in about 2Â½ years ago to clean up the messes, and has focused on resolving outstanding regulatory issues and cutting costs. The Federal Reserve has capped the size of its balance sheet for more than four years.</p><p>Mr. Scharf's pay lags behind that of the chiefs of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp., all of whom earned more than $30 million. He was paid more than Citigroup Inc.'s new CEO, who started last year and earned $22.5 million.</p><p>Still, Mr. Scharf's total annualized compensation was 290 times the $73,578 that the median Wells Fargo employee took home last year, the bank said.</p><p>Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com</p><p>Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf Gets 20% Pay Raise</p>",
