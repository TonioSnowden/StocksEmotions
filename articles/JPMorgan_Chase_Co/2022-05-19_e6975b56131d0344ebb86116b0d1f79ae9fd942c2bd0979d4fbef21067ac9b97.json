  "text": "<p>Sri Lanka's central bank has confirmed the country has missed a deadline for foreign debt repayments, the first sovereign default in the Asia-Pacific region this century, according to Moody's.</p> <p>A 30-day grace period for missed interest payments on two international sovereign bonds expired on Wednesday, forcing Sri Lanka into what some analysts called a “hard” default as the country confronts an economic and political crisis. The last Moody's-rated sovereign borrower to default in Asia was Pakistan in 1999.</p> <p>President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c06a762f-3d78-44d1-94d5-82c393dbd647\">said last month</a> that Sri Lanka would stop repaying its international debt to conserve foreign currency reserves for imports such as fuel, medicine and food.</p> <p>Sri Lanka, which has never defaulted before, owes about $51bn in overseas debt to international bondholders as well as bilateral creditors including China, Japan and India.</p> <p>At a briefing on Thursday, Nandalal Weerasinghe, the central bank governor, confirmed that Sri Lanka's creditors could now consider the country technically in default.</p> <p>“We announced to the creditors, we said we are not in question to pay that. If you even don't pay after 30 days . . . then probably from their side they can consider it as a default,” he said. “Our positions are clear. We say until they come to restructure we will not be able to pay.”</p> <p>But the central bank disputed that it was a hard default, calling the move “pre-emptive”.</p> <p>S&amp;P last month downgraded Sri Lanka's foreign currency ratings to “selective default” on the missed interest payments. </p> <p>Analysts said that rising global interest rates, high energy prices and a surge in inflation were piling pressure on import-dependent developing economies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/dd9a1b55-e171-3d0a-a9f8-4c6e471b1e80\">Sri Lanka</a>.</p> <p>The island borrowed heavily to fund infrastructure-led growth after the end of its civil war in 2009, but policies including a 2019 tax cut and the loss of tourism during the pandemic left it unable to refinance in international debt markets.</p> <p>The crisis has triggered widespread pain for Sri Lanka's population, with a scarcity of fuel leading to long queues for petrol and multi-hour power cuts. The currency has also plunged, exacerbating political unrest.</p> <p>The cabinet, including Gotabaya's brother Mahinda, the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ee451b9-17eb-4645-b9b6-4973bd4eb97b\">resigned last week</a> as attacks by pro-government supporters against a growing protest movement triggered a wave of violence across the island.</p> <p>Ranil Wickremesinghe, the newly appointed prime minister, said this week that the Treasury was struggling to find $1mn to pay for imports.</p> <p>Sri Lanka has begun negotiations with the IMF over a loan programme and is appointing advisers for debt restructuring talks with its creditors. But it lacks a fully functioning government, including a finance minister, and analysts expect any deal to take months.</p> <p>The missed payments, for interest on two $1.25bn international sovereign bonds maturing in 2023 and 2028, could trigger cross-default clauses that would bring much of Sri Lanka's debt due before it has begun formal restructuring talks.</p> <p>A Sri Lankan government bond maturing in July this year is trading at about 45 cents to the dollar, with longer-dated bonds at even lower values.</p> <p>JPMorgan on Wednesday assigned an overweight rating to Sri Lanka bonds, indicating that it expected bond prices to rise in the coming months.</p> <p>“Twists and turns are likely to materialise in the months ahead,” JPMorgan wrote. “However . . . we think risk-reward is favourable to start building long positions.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong</em></p><p>Source: Benjamin Parkin in Colombo and Chloe Cornish in Mumbai 2022 'Sri Lanka becomes first Asia-Pacific country in decades to default on foreign debt' FT.com 19 May.
