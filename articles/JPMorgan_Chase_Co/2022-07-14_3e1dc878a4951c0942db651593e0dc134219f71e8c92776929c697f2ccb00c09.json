  "title": "Dow, S&P 500 Close Lower as Banks Kick Off Earnings Season; JPMorgan Chase lifts provisions for potential loan losses, signaling a dour outlook for the economy",
  "text": "<p>The second-quarter earnings season ramped up Thursday, with reports from JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. More results from the country's top financial institutions are slated for Friday and Monday. With fears of a potential recession looming, investors are looking to what bank executives say about the state of the economy as much as their institutions' balance sheets.</p><p>\"We're starting to head into the heavy-duty earnings season and people are going to be combing through those earnings reports looking for any hint of softness or how companies are dealing with what they're seeing in their own individual markets,\" said Cheryl Smith, economist and portfolio manager at Trillium Asset Management.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase shares fell $3.91, or 3.5%, to $108 after the bank said it set aside another $428 million to cover possible future loan losses, suggesting it had grown more dour about the U.S. economy. The stock was a top decliner on the Dow.</p><p>\"When you see interest rates move up and there is a downturn in the economy you will inevitably see more people unable to make their loan repayments,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>Morgan Stanley shares slipped 29 cents, or 0.4%, to $74.69 after it said second-quarter profit slumped 29%. Both banks reported earnings per share that missed analysts' forecasts, suggesting that earnings estimates are too optimistic, Mr. Innes said.</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index shed 2%.</p><p>Investors also parsed a fresh inflation reading showing producer prices picked up in June. The producer-price index, which generally reflects supply conditions in the economy, increased to 11.3% last month from the year prior, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>The latest update on wholesale prices comes a day after the Labor Department said consumer inflation hit a four-decade high last month. The stronger-than-expected reading heightened investors' fears the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates than anticipated.</p><p>Fed governor Christopher Waller on Thursday said he would favor a 0.75-percentage-point rate increase at the central bank's meeting later this month—though disappointing economic data between now and then could tip the scale in favor of a larger increase.</p><p>\"When you make a list of potential issues going forward…it could be a soft landing or a hard landing,\" JP Morgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said Thursday. \"You do have a serious set of issues out there.\"</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.957% from 2.904% on Wednesday, while the yield on the two-year note was unchanged. Bond yields rise as prices fall. The two-year yield remained above the 10-year yield, a situation known as an inverted yield curve that is often taken as a predictor of a recession.</p><p>\"The Fed will keep hiking rates until they get material signs that the economy is rolling over,\" said Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at Mediolanum International Funds. \"Effectively the Fed has got to keep hiking rates until they break something.\"</p><p>Jobless claims edged up last week to thehighest level this year, data released Thursday showed. The figures, though low by historic standards, have trended higher in recent weeks.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude dipped 47 cents, or 0.5%, to $99.10 a barrel on Thursday. The international oil benchmark has slumped this month as investors fear a recession would undermine demand, on pace to reverse much of its gains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which roiled global markets and pushed energy prices higher this year.</p><p>Energy stocks were the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, down 1.9%. Marathon Oil Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. both lost 1.6%. Other commodity-related companies also fell Thursday: Fertilizer stocks CF Industries Holdings and Mosaic each dropped 5.7%, among the biggest losers on the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Conagra Brands logged the steepest decline on the S&amp;P 500 after the food company's latest earnings report. Shares sunk $2.59, or 7.3%, to $33.15. The maker of Duncan Hines cake mixes and Slim Jim meat snacks said it plans further price increases in the coming months as it races to offset double-digit cost inflation.</p><p>Gold prices extended their tumble in the wake of the higher-than-expected inflation figures. The precious metal fell 1.7% to $1,704.50 a troy ounce, and has lost 5.5% this month. Gold, while often considered a hedge against inflation, becomes less attractive to investors when interest rates rise.</p><p>In Europe, Italian stocks led losses amid political turmoil in the country. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi announced his resignation Thursday after a key party in his coalition pulled its support for his government. Italy's FTSE MIB fell 3.4%, while the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 declined 1.5%.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.6%. The euro closed above parity with the U.S. dollar, but recently traded below parity and at its weakest level since 2002.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged down 0.2%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.1%.</p><p>Write to Hannah Miao at hannah.miao@wsj.com and Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Dow, S&amp;P 500 Close Lower as Banks Kick Off Earnings Season</p>",
