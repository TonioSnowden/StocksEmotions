  "text": "<p>Behind the scenes of a Super Bowl party at the home of retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez in February last year, a battle was brewing over who would manage his multimillion-dollar fortune.</p> <p>On one side was Mary Erdoes, the powerful head of asset and wealth management at US banking giant JPMorgan Chase, which was sponsoring Rodriguez's party. On the other was Gwen Campbell, a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch who was overseeing much of Rodriguez's wealth. </p> <p>After Rodriguez introduced the two women, Erdoes made a case to Campbell to switch companies and join JPMorgan, with the hope Rodriguez would then transfer more of his money to the bank. </p> <p>JPMorgan had been trying to recruit Campbell for months, with meetings in New York and promises to hire more people for her team, according to a California court filing on December 2 that detailed the meeting between Campbell and Erdoes at Rodriguez's party. </p> <p>Campbell eventually made the switch in October 2020 and was welcomed with a call from Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive. </p> <p>Joining from Merrill, a division within Bank of America, Campbell was based out of San Francisco and brought with her almost $1.4bn in client assets and loans, including hundreds of millions of dollars from Rodriguez. </p> <p>Just over a year since joining JPMorgan, however, things have soured. The situation has devolved into a legal dispute between the bank and Campbell, who is arguing that her new colleagues have been trying to poach her billionaire and multimillionaire clients, with Rodriguez the main target.</p> <p>She has filed for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1d1dcbd-ccec-4212-ae53-38e3f5b71bd5\">temporary restraining order</a> against JPMorgan to restrict her co-workers' ability to engage with her clients, as she seeks damages through arbitration for what she alleges is a breach of contract. </p> <p>In the blistering 48-page legal filing, Campbell describes the turf war between rival businesses at JPMorgan as a “shark tank”, claiming her co-workers have disparaged and undermined her. </p> <p>The bank has said Campbell's claims “have no merit and we look forward to presenting the facts to the court”.</p> <p>JPMorgan has filed a motion opposing the request for a restraining order in which the bank said Campbell “fails to identify a single lost client or any net loss in her total assets under management”.</p> <p>Rodriguez is not named in Campbell's filing but people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that the “Pro Athlete Client” referenced in it is Rodriguez. Representatives for Campbell and JPMorgan have declined to comment. Rodriguez did not reply to requests for comment.</p> <p>The dispute puts on public display the tensions between separate but overlapping business divisions at JPMorgan that were made more acute when the bank acquired Bear Stearns during the 2008 financial crisis. </p> <p>It is also a reflection of the occasionally unwieldy structure of the modern-day JPMorgan, which is the product of multiple mergers over decades.</p> <p>JPMorgan Advisors, where Campbell works, is the old Bear Stearns financial advisory business. It employs roughly 450 advisers and sits within JPMorgan Wealth Management, whose chief executive is Kristin Lemkau and which also houses Chase Wealth Management. JPMorgan Wealth Management is part of JPMorgan's consumer and community banking division. </p> <p>In the separate asset and wealth management division, run by Erdoes, is JPMorgan's private bank with about 2,600 client advisers. </p> <p>JPMorgan Advisors' model is to employ financial advisers who get paid mostly on commission. The bank's relationship with wealthy clients is funnelled primarily through these advisers. The private bank also caters to rich clients but they tend to have dealings with the bank as a whole. </p> <p>There is co-operation on things that one unit offers but the other does not. However, they also at times compete for the same business, including lending and providing investment advice, a dynamic that can create tension. </p> <p>“You don't feel like you're working at the same company. You feel like you're working at different firms,” said one former JPMorgan private banker. </p> <p>One JPMorgan banker said the two divisions are siloed so that transferring assets from one to the other is no easier than if it came from an outside bank.</p> <p>The strains have previously been raised to Erdoes internally over the years, including one instance where one banker questioned why JPMorgan Securities, as JPMorgan Advisors was branded at the time, was able to offer certain services at different rates, according to one person who attended. Her response was that both companies were important to the bank and they want to continue to grow the two of them. </p> <p>Dimon has also been made aware of the internal competition in the past and his response has been that bankers should go after business JPMorgan does not currently have rather than fight over business it already does, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Tensions can get particularly heated when on the line is a high-profile client such as Rodriguez, who earned about $400m during a more than two-decade baseball career. Since retiring in 2016 with the Yankees, he has gone on to become an investor, broadcaster and entrepreneur. </p> <p>Prior to Campbell joining, JPMorgan's private bank had tried for several years to win Rodriguez as a client but he so far only had “a low-seven-figure amount” with the bank, according to Campbell's legal filing. Even this, Campbell claims, was only generated by fees paid to Rodriguez to appear at JPMorgan events. </p> <p>Given that Rodriguez already had an account at the private bank, he was classified as a shared client between the two divisions when Campbell brought his assets over to JPMorgan Advisors. </p> <p>Rodriguez had also previously worked with JPMorgan to structure a bid for the New York Mets. The baseball team was ultimately sold to hedge fund titan Steve Cohen in 2020. </p> <p>When Campbell was negotiating her move to JPMorgan, she included in her contract provisions to address concerns she had about the overlapping interests between JPMorgan Advisors and the private bank, and the potential for internal conflicts, according to her legal filing. This included a note that the approach to dealing with shared clients would be to “maintain the current nature of their relationship with the private bank”.</p> <p>JPMorgan has subsequently argued that maintaining the nature of a relationship “is not the same as a promise to never engage with clients on new business”.</p> <p>Soon after Rodriguez brought his assets over with Campbell's move to JPMorgan Advisors, she claims her colleagues at the private bank began pitching Rodriguez for services that she was already providing. </p> <p>In an email to JPMorgan afterwards, Rodriguez said he wanted “Campbell to captain the relationship at JPM including my personal wealth and our corporate entities, and including investing in private and public investments, planning and raising capital”.</p> <p>Tensions escalated when Rodriguez was seeking a loan to fund his purchase of a minority stake in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85583fde-ec3b-4b8a-95f5-0ab1bb092cc8\">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> basketball team.</p> <p>Rodriguez had initially looked to take out the loan through Campbell and JPMorgan Advisors, but was eventually steered to the private bank, which Campbell alleges was “a ruse to drastically restructure” Rodriguez's relationship with the bank. </p> <p>In talks over the loan, one colleague is alleged to have called her a “no one” and said she was “confused”. Campbell also claims to have learnt from clients that JPMorgan employees had made disparaging remarks about her. </p> <p>In its counter-filing, JPMorgan said the past two months have been Campbell's best for revenue generation since she arrived at the bank “despite her claim of an ongoing campaign to ‘cannibalise' her business”, and that the bank credited her with the loan and scheduled her to receive commissions for it.</p> <p>In addition to Rodriguez, Campbell alleges that JPMorgan's private bank has pursued business with at least two other wealthy clients, referred to as “the family trust of a billionaire private equity firm founder” and “a billionaire businessman who is a member of the Forbes 400 list”.</p> <p>Campbell on Thursday filed for arbitration proceedings, seeking financial damages. </p> <p>Also on Thursday was the first hearing in northern California district court for her restraining order request against JPMorgan, which her lawyer argues is necessary to prevent damage to her business which cannot be remedied financially. </p> <p>In the meantime, the upcoming Super Bowl is scheduled for February 13. It remains to be seen whether Erdoes and Campbell will be at the same party again this year. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sara Germano in New York</em></p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'A baseball star in the ‘shark tank': inside JPMorgan's client poaching row' FT.com 12 December.
