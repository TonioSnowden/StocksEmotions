  "text": "<p>But he hasn't changed his mind, saying the selloff in cyclicals and small-caps RUT in particular are overdone. “Many market metrics such as recent performance of high vs. low beta stocks and valuations of small-caps are already fully pricing in a recession — something we do not see materializing,” Kolanovic says in a note to clients. There's also an attractive risk-reward in China and emerging-market equities EEM.</p><p>“While jitters around a Fed hiking cycle are understandable, this has been magnified by technical factors that can change quickly — i.e., we could see a reversal of systematic outflows, pickup in buyback activity as we exit blackout windows, and magnification of flows by weak liquidity and short-gamma hedgers,” he says.</p><p>His bottom line is that the Federal Reserve tightening should not derail the current cycle. “Similar to the 2004-2006 Fed tightening cycle, the current cycle is taking place in a backdrop of above average nominal [gross domestic product] and [earnings per share] growth, which should allow the equity market to easily outperform cash and fixed income over the coming years, even if one assumes some gradual derating,” he says.</p><p>The flip side of this argument comes from Alfonso Peccatiello, a former head of a trading desk and now author of The Macro Compass blog, who notes the spread on overnight index swaps is dangerously close to inverting, at just 16 basis points on Monday. (The more widely followed Treasury curve isn't as close to inversion, but is a less-pure metric in his opinion due to the credit spread.) This near-inversion is the byproduct of both a more hawkish Fed as well as deteriorating economic data.</p><p>Inverted yield curves, he argues, not only predict recessions but also contribute to them. After all, an indebted investor looking at higher short-term rates than long-term would naturally refinance. “A vicious circle therefore unfolds: restricted/more expensive access to credit in an already slowing and poor long-term growth environment leads the private sector to be more defensive, which compounds on the already ongoing cyclical slowdown,” he writes.</p><p>The chart</p><p>Everyone's talking about Russian-Ukrainian tensions through the prism of its impact on energy. Less well known is the degree to which Russia supplies the palladium market, a vital commodity for catalytic converters, fuel cells, jewelry and dentistry, among its other users. Strategists at UBS note that when palladium prices have climbed in January, it was generally on days when Russian assets weren't stressed. “Not much happened to international assets in 2014, and that's the template the market seems to be using today,” say strategists led by Bhanu Baweja. “But there is a clear risk that the current situation is more serious.”</p><p>The buzz</p><p>There's a crowded slate of economic data, including the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for January and job openings for December.</p><p>The earnings calendar includes Exxon Mobil XOM, and after the close, Alphabet GOOGL, General Motors GM and Starbucks SBUX.</p><p>UBS UBS rallied in Swiss trade after the bank said it would buy back up to $5 billion in stock following a stronger-than-forecast fourth-quarter profit.</p><p>The market</p><p>After the monster rally on Monday following some key broker upgrades and end of the month rebalancing, U.S. stock futures ES00NQ00 were languishing.
