  "text": "<p>The casino sector's gains came after news over the weekend that Macau is set to resume issuing electronic visas and allowing Chinese group tours around late October or early November.</p><p>Analysts said the easing came earlier than expected and could facilitate a faster return of Chinese visitors to Macau.</p><p>JPMorgan said the move was the most significant easing since Macau's border with China reopened two years ago. The move should \"alleviate friction for a Macau trip, as well as signal to many that it's OK to visit Macau,\" JPMorgan analyst DS Kim said in a note.</p><p>Mr. Kim said the lack of electronic visas has been \"the most common push-back we heard,\" and noted that group tours used to account for about 25% of Chinese visitors to the city before the pandemic.</p><p>\"Now that Macau has a clear roadmap to recovery, this neglected sector should recapture investors' attention,\" Citi analysts said in a note. Citi added that this shows Beijing fully supports Macau's economic recovery.</p><p>Both Citi and JPMorgan have a bullish stance on the sector. Citi's top picks are Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment, while JPMorgan's top pick is Sands China.</p><p>But other analysts are more cautious. The gambling hub's \"pace of recovery [is] still uncertain,\" Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee said in a note. Meanwhile, \"quarantine fears continue to deter overseas travel given China's rapid lockdowns strategy during new local infection cases,\" Mr. Lee added.</p><p>Jefferies projected that gaming revenue in 2022 will only be 14% of prepandemic levels, with revenue improving further to 46% of prepandemic levels in 2023.</p><p>Write to Clarence Leong at clarence.leong@wsj.com</p><p>Macau Casino shares jump on hopes of sooner return to normal</p>",
