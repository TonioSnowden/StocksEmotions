  "text": "<p>Federal prosecutors are investigating ties between Donald Trump's fledgling social media network and a former nightclub proprietor who once sued a police force for claiming that his venue was financed by the Russian mob.</p> <p>Michael Shvartsman, 51, is chief executive of Rocket One Capital, a Miami-based firm that was an early investor in a vehicle that is set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group.</p> <p>Born in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, Shvartsman spent most of his early life in Canada, where for some time he helped run a nightclub called Kaos, which attracted the attention of the Edmonton police department. Now he is at the centre of one of the most controversial US business launches of recent years, a possible future shareholder in an upstart media venture that is set to play an outsized role in the 2024 presidential election.</p> <p>A federal grand jury in New York last month asked for information about Rocket One from TMTG's Nasdaq-listed merger partner, Digital World Acquisition Corp, and each of its directors. The chief strategy officer of Shvartsman's firm, Bruce Garelick, was nominated to DWAC's board last year, ahead of the company's initial public offering.</p> <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has been examining contacts between DWAC executives and people involved with Trump's media group, according to a person familiar with the probe.</p> <p>The agency is charged with enforcing rules governing so-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/special-purpose-acquisition-companies\">special purpose acquisition companies</a>, which are supposed to list on the stock market as a cash shell and then hunt a merger target.</p> <p>Prosecutors in the southern district of New York did not respond to questions about the reasons for their interest in Rocket One, and it is unclear whether they are pursuing a line of inquiry similar to the SEC's.</p> <p>Garelick could not be reached for comment. A representative for Shvartsman did not provide a comment on the Department of Justice subpoenas.</p> <p>Set up to compete with Twitter and other internet platforms that banned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/donald-trump\">Trump</a> during the post-election violence of January 2021, TMTG has attracted significant interest from stock market investors. DWAC shares increased from $10 to $94 after the Trump deal was announced, before falling back as potential legal obstacles to the transaction have grown.</p> <p>Both companies are led by executives with rightwing political ties. TMTG chief executive Devin Nunes is a former California congressman who was Trump's key ally on the House intelligence committee. DWAC chief financial officer Luiz Philippe of Orléans-Braganza is a Brazilian politician aligned with far-right president Jair Bolsonaro.</p> <p>In contrast, Shvartsman, who invested in the September IPO alongside ordinary investors according to a person familiar with the transaction, appears to have no more connection to politics today than he did in the 1990s, as manager of nightspot Kaos.</p> <p>The Edmonton Police Service claimed Kaos was financed by the Russian mafia, according to a lawsuit that Shvartsman filed against several police officers and the city. That assertion was among more than a dozen “false” and “malicious” allegations that the lawsuit said were put forward by police in communications with their landlord, government authorities and the general public.</p> <p>The lawsuit was dismissed, and the plaintiffs were ordered to pay the police tens of thousands of dollars in costs, according to a spokeswoman for the force. A lawyer for Shvartsman did not elaborate on the outcome of the case, in which no findings were made as to the truth of the allegations publicised by the police. Shvartsman has never been charged with any crime.</p> <p>The nightclub folded in 1999, and some time afterwards Shvartsman moved to Florida, where he has an eclectic collection of business interests. Among the companies where he has been involved as an owner or executive are Conquest Financial Services, a supplier of credit card machines for small businesses, and Conquest Financial Management Corp, which supplies patio furniture to hotels.</p> <p>It has not always been plain sailing. In 2019 Shvartsman's furniture company was sued by JPMorgan Chase over an allegedly unpaid $2mn loan; the case was settled. The year before, a federal judge ordered the company to pay $454,000 to a Bahamanian resort after it failed to deliver 1,420 chaises longues. Rocket One Capital, the company that has drawn the attention of prosecutors, also had a contentious inception. Originally called Foundation Capital, the company rebranded after a California company of the same name sued Shvartsman's firm alleging trademark infringement. That lawsuit, too, was settled.</p> <p>“What initially started as a family office has turned into a venture capital firm,” Rocket One stated on its website, until it was removed from the internet hours after the subpoenas became public. The firm said it sought to invest between $250,000 and $15mn at a time, and its website listed 19 portfolio companies, including Airbnb, which it described as “one of the most innovative and disruptive companies of this past decade”.</p> <p>Airbnb said it had no record of any investment by Shvartsman or Rocket One. Shvartsman's firm did not fund Airbnb directly but bought its shares in a secondary market transaction, according to a person who knows him. </p> <p>Other portfolio companies listed on Rocket One's website have attained less prominence. One of them, Joblio, describes itself as a “transparent, systematized and humanized migrant labor recruitment platform”, offering to connect employers in rich economies such as Canada with applicants in less wealthy or war-torn countries including Ukraine and Uzbekistan.</p> <p>Joblio's founder is Jon Purizhansky, a New York businessman and longtime associate of Shvartsman who left the Soviet Union as a teenager to build a life in the west. Both men are listed as directors of the company's UK subsidiary, but Purizhansky — who was barred from the debt collection industry and has a felony conviction for his role in fraudulently obtaining a US work visa for a garage mechanic from Azerbaijan — told the Financial Times through a spokesman that Rocket One Capital “is neither an investor [n]or shareholder in Joblio”.</p> <p>DWAC told investors last month that the investigations were likely to delay its merger with TMTG. It is unclear where that leaves the Trump venture's $1bn in expected proceeds, or the aspirations of investors such as Shvartsman.</p> <p>But scrutiny from prosecutors has coincided with a series of personnel changes at Trump's media company and its would-be acquirer. Garelick, the Rocket One Capital strategy boss, stepped down from the board of DWAC days after the latest batch of subpoenas arrived. And when TMTG filed an updated list of directors with the Florida business registry in June, six of the original names had been removed, among them that of the company's chair and star attraction, Donald Trump.</p><p>Source: Mark Vandevelde and Ortenca Aliaj in New York 2022 'The colourful Rocket man behind Donald Trump's stalled stock debut' FT.com 20 July.
