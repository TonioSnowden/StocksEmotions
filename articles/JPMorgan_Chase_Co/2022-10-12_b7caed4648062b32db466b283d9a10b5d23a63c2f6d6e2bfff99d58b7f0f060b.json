  "title": "PepsiCo's Higher Prices for Soda and Snacks Test Consumers' Resolve; The maker of Pepsi and Doritos said its third-quarter sales rose as prices increased 17% on average",
  "text": "<p>PepsiCo, the company behind brands including Doritos chips, Quaker Oats oatmeal and its Mountain Dew and namesake Pepsi sodas, said the higher prices are helping it offset cost increases.</p><p>On Wednesday the company said for the quarter ended Sept. 3, organic sales, which strip out currency effects, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 16% from a year earlier. All of the gains came from the 17% average price increase. In the June quarter, PepsiCo's prices were up 12% on average from a year earlier.</p><p>Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta told analysts on a conference call that PepsiCo is reducing promotions and focusing on formats where consumers are less sensitive to price to help boost revenue.</p><p>\"The consumer has very much stuck with our products,\" said Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's finance chief, in an interview. \"In a world where there are many struggles and stresses, we are kind of an affordable luxury.\"</p><p>PepsiCo's quarterly results and raised outlook helped lift the share prices of consumer-products companies such as Coca-Cola Co., Clorox Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. on Wednesday. Some investors have been bracing for earnings reports from large companies to show signs of strains from elevated costs, blows to demand and strength in the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Shares in PepsiCo gained 4.2% to $169.39. The company's shares are down about 2% this year, compared with a 25% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Digital marketplace Etsy Inc., wine and spirits maker Brown-Forman Corp. and makeup giant Estée Lauder Cos. are among companies where executives in recent months have touted their products being able to withstand shifts in consumer spending. \"We use the term affordable luxury a lot, and I do think spirits is an affordable luxury where consumers, they prioritize that bottle of Jack Daniel's,\" said Brown-Forman Chief Executive Lawson Whiting on an earnings conference call with analysts in August.</p><p>Consumers have pulled back on spending as a result of persistent inflation—with the changes affecting items as diverse as apparel and products that aren't replaced as often, such as refrigerators. People across income levels have shifted spending to more private-label goods and stepped up purchases with discounters or lower-price stores.</p><p>PepsiCo benefits from having goods across a range of prices, and finding ways to create price points that are affordable, said Andrea Teixeira, an equities analyst at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. who monitors makers of beverages, household goods and personal-care items.</p><p>\"I don't think consumers go to the supermarket and say my bag of Doritos costs 15% more than it used to,\" she said. \"The advantage of these products is that we don't have price memory because everything else is moving toward the same direction.\"</p><p>The pressure that rising costs are putting on companies' bottom lines might not let up soon. One measure of what suppliers charge businesses and other customers rose in September, a reversal from the two previous months. The produce-price index can serve as a signal for consumer prices because businesses often pass along higher costs to consumers. A reading on consumer prices is due out Thursday.</p><p>Higher prices alsohaven't been a sure sign that companies can increase profit margins. PepsiCo said commodity and transportation costs are expected to be elevated for the rest of the year.</p><p>The beverage company based in Purchase, N.Y., said it is cutting costs to offset the pressure on profit margins and to weather what appear to be worsening macroeconomic conditions, executives said.</p><p>\"There may be a point when the revenue growth slows down,\" Mr. Johnston said. He added: \"We just have to be prepared for it.\"</p><p>Overall, PepsiCo reported a profit of $2.7 billion, or $1.95 a share, compared with $2.22 billion, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, such as the divestiture of Tropicana and other juice brands, PepsiCo said per-share earnings were $1.97. Analysts polled by FactSet expected per-share earnings of $1.84.</p><p>Revenue came in at $21.97 billion, up nearly 9%. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected revenue of $20.83 billion.</p><p>PepsiCo's Higher Prices for Soda and Snacks Test Consumers' Resolve</p>",
