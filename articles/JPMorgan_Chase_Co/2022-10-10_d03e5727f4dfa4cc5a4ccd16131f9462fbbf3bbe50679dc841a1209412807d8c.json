  "title": "U.S. Stocks Fall Amid Volatile Trading; Shifting expectations about Fed's interest-rate increases and further escalation in Ukraine war weigh on markets",
  "text": "<p>With the U.S. bond market closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday, some strategists see little potential relief for the stock market.</p><p>\"The bond market has been setting the narrative for stocks,\" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird. \"We need buyers of bonds before we get buyers of stocks… until yields start to fall, the case for stocks is very weak.\"</p><p>Stocks have swung in recent days, driven by shifting expectations about more interest-rate increases from the Fed. Friday's jobs report showed the labor market is still tight as the unemployment rate fell back to a half-century low, exacerbating concerns that the Fed could tighten financial conditions more aggressively.</p><p>Hopes for a \"Fed Pivot\"—in which the central bank would pause interest-rate increases, jolting stocks higher—have largely been dashed. Traders now expect the benchmark federal funds rate to touch above 4.7% by the second quarter of 2023, according to FactSet derivatives-data, more aggressive than the Fed's own forecasts.</p><p>\"Inflation is still high and the labor market is red hot—there's nothing to suggest the Fed will be dovish or pivot for at least several months,\" added Mr. Antonelli.</p><p>Investors are looking ahead to the next U.S. inflation data release Thursday as another important indicator for where monetary policy may be headed.</p><p>\"There's still that hangover in markets. The U.S. labor market is still incredibly strong and the Fed has a single mandate right now: inflation,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"The most important number in the world right now\" is the coming inflation figure, he said.</p><p>Earnings season is picking up speed, with household names in the consumer and finance sectors set to report this week. PepsiCo is on the docket for Wednesday and Delta Air Lines, Walgreens Boots Alliance and BlackRock will give updates Thursday. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup will report on Friday.</p><p>\"Everyone is expecting a poor earnings season but quite a lot of that is already priced in. We're expecting downgrades, guidance coming down. But that still doesn't mean we can't get negative surprises,\" Ms. Dwek said.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%. The Bank of England saidit may increase bond purchases that are part of a market-stabilizing operation and put forward a new repo facility for banks. U.K. government bonds sold off. The yield on the 30-year gilt rose to 4.586% from 4.380% on Friday, extending its climb into a sixth consecutive trading session.</p><p>\"It's a credibility issue. The bank saying it may or may not buy some bonds doesn't deal with that,\" said James Athey, an investment manager at Abrdn. The British government sparked turmoil in U.K. markets in recent weeks with an unpopular package of tax cuts.</p><p>\"Also, the closer we get to the date this program is due to end, the more nervous investors holding long-dated gilts are going to get,\" Mr. Athey said. The program is set to end on Friday.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3%.</p><p>Oil prices were relatively unchanged with global crude benchmark Brent trading at $97.81 a barrel. Traders said they were focusing on the coming inflation data and what it could mean for Fed policy.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Fall Amid Volatile Trading</p>",
