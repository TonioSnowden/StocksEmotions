  "title": "Credit Suisse, Community Health Face Lawsuit in Quorum's Bankruptcy; Litigation trustee and bondholder representative say $1.2 billion dividend, $20 million in transaction fees should be repaid",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuit was filed Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., by litigation trustee Daniel Golden and by Wilmington Savings Fund Society, which represents unsecured bondholders who are among the creditors who have received less than 10 cents on the dollar of what they are owed. During bankruptcies, a litigation trustee often files and manages lawsuits on creditors' behalf.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Community Health caused Quorum to take on more than $1.2 billion in debt, with proceeds paid to Community Health as a dividend.</p><p>\"No reasonable fiduciary acting in QHC's best interest would have agreed to burden QHC with that amount of debt, or to pay the proceeds to CHS as a dividend without receiving any value in return,\" the lawsuit said.</p><p>Community Health tapped its investment banker, Credit Suisse, to \"nominally\" serve as Quorum's investment banker during the spinoff, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>\"Credit Suisse, motivated by its lucrative relationship with CHS, then assisted CHS in the fraudulent machinations necessary to raise the funds needed to pay the spin-off dividend, notwithstanding Credit Suisse's knowledge that QHC would not be able to sustain that level of debt,\" the lawsuit said.</p><p>Community Health also burdened Quorum with \"onerous\" transition-services agreements that required Quorum to pay more than $150 million to Community Health, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Community Health, which has 84 hospitals, said that the allegations have no merit and that it will vigorously defend itself. A Community Health spokeswoman said the Quorum spinoff was a carefully deliberated transaction reviewed by independent third parties that included lawyers, accountants and consultants.</p><p>Quorum's own board investigated similar allegations and didn't believe there was enough reason to pursue them, a June 2020 court filing by Quorum shows.</p><p>Quorum Health exited bankruptcy in June 2020 with $500 million less debt.</p><p>The lawsuit said Community Health should be liable for the amount owed to the unsecured bondholders, roughly $400 million, and that Community Health and Credit Suisse should repay to Quorum creditors what they received in dividends, transaction fees and payments under transition services agreements.</p><p>Quorum paid Credit Suisse more than $20 million for services, the lawsuit said. Credit Suisse declined to comment.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
