  "title": "Data Centers Face Higher Costs, Weaker Demand for Debt That Fueled Sector's Rise; Issuance of asset-backed securities in the market has plunged as investors seek higher yields",
  "text": "<p>Data-center operators are confronting higher costs and a smaller investor appetite for the securitized debt that has helped to fuel the sector's rapid expansion in recent years, pressuring the industry as it faces a possible recession.</p><p>Companies in the industry make money by leasing space and providing services to technology and other companies. The sector four years ago began raising cash by packaging their leases into securities and selling the debt to investors, including insurance companies and other financial institutions. Those deals, which have been a key source of capital for the sector and increased steadily through last year, have plunged so far in 2022 as investors seek higher yields and assess risk across their portfolios as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.</p><p>Data-center companies this year as of Oct. 14 issued $550 million in securitized debt, down from $2.66 billion during the prior-year period and $6.17 billion for all of 2021, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., whose data includes rated transactions and excludes unrated and private deals. By comparison, total volumes of asset-backed securities, including auto loans and credit cards, increased by nearly 2% over the same period, to $207.5 billion, JPMorgan said.</p><p>The decline in issuance of data-center debt comes as chief financial officers across industries evaluate their funding options amid the Fed's rate-hike campaign. Within the data-center sector in particular, that calculus for some companies involves assessing whether the timing is right to tap the securitization market despite the higher costs.</p><p>The sector's clients include investment-grade companies and demand for space remains strong. But it also faces potential risks, including if a company depends on few clients or needs to make significant capital expenditures, or the possibility of future innovation reducing customers' real-estate needs, analysts said.</p><p>What's more, while the data-center sector is much bigger now than it was during the 2007-09 recession, it hasn't been tested. \"We haven't seen the sector perform through a down cycle yet,\" said Neeraj Ahuja, senior credit analyst at ratings firm Moody's Corp.</p><p>Still, data-center ABS deals have typically been well received by investors for their relatively low credit risk. The leases underpinning securitization deals include those signed by large technology and cloud-computing companies. Privately held companies in the sector can attract higher credit ratings and lower financing costs on securitization deals than they would in the corporate bond market.</p><p>\"We can get more leverage and better pricing at higher ratings,\" said Sharif Metwalli, chief financial officer at Vantage Data Centers, comparing the securitization market to other financing options such as bank loans or corporate bonds. Vantage Data Centers issued the sector's first securitization deal four years ago; since then, the company has raised about $3.9 billion.</p><p>Vantage Data Centers expects to go to the securitization market in the coming year to refinance $216 million in debt due in November 2023, according to Mr. Metwalli. The Denver-based company—which is owned by a consortium of investors including the real-estate investment firm DigitalBridge Group Inc.—has $2.7 billion in total securitization debt outstanding, Mr. Metwalli said.</p><p>The company expects to pay higher capital costs as a result of the refinancing, but anticipates those costs will be manageable since the coming refinancing deal accounts for 8% of its total debt, Mr. Metwalli said. It also anticipates having to raise capital from a larger pool of investors, since many are currently writing smaller checks, he said.</p><p>Vantage primarily uses the funding it raises from securitization deals to pay off loans that it takes out to develop new facilities, Mr. Metwalli said. Those loans typically have three-year terms with options to extend. Once a facility is up and running, often within 12 to 16 months, the company packages the leases and other assets from a group of properties into securities and sells them to debt investors.</p><p>The securitization market has historically provided Vantage with more money than it has needed to pay down its loans, Mr. Metwalli said. \"We can take that money, along with our equity and new construction financing\" and develop new facilities, he said.</p><p>Demand for data-center space from technology companies has increased in recent years, driven by investments in cloud computing accelerated in part by the pandemic. During the second half of last year, global data centers operated a total capacity of 246.8 million square feet, up 28% from the same period a year earlier, and up from just over 100 million square feet in 2018, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.</p><p>The pace of new development in the sector has slowed in the past year, coming off multiyear highs. It is projected to rise 3.75% during the first half of 2023 compared with the prior six months, according to Credit Suisse. That compares with a projected increase of 3.96% for the first half of 2022 after an actual increase of 18.49% during the first half of 2021, Credit Suisse said.</p><p>A sustained slowdown in the securitization market could make it harder for smaller, privately held data-center operators to access capital, pressuring their long-term growth, industry executives said.</p><p>\"I've thought the market for data-center assets has been a little crazy the last few years, with valuations too high and money chasing properties that don't have some of the networking advantages of the global companies,\" said Matt Dolgin, an equity analyst who covers the sector at Morningstar Inc., a financial research firm.</p><p>Digital Realty Trust Inc., a publicly traded company in the sector with an investment-grade rating, has avoided the securitization market. Such deals can be more cumbersome and involve more restrictive covenants and terms compared with unsecured corporate bonds, Jordan Sadler, senior vice president of public and private investor relations at Digital Realty, said in a statement.</p><p>\"While we are happy to have all potential financing options at our disposal, we feel well-positioned and encouraged that we do not have to rely on a single financing market or mechanism in today's volatile capital markets climate,\" Mr. Sadler said.</p><p>Write to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com</p><p>Data Centers Face Higher Costs, Weaker Demand for Debt That Fueled Sector's Rise</p>",
