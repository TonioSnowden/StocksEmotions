  "title": "Business News: Wells Fargo Targets Sept. 6 Office Return",
  "text": "<p>The memo didn't say whether employees would return full time or part time and said many of the details have yet to be worked out.</p><p>Banks have taken an ad hoc approach to bringing employees back. Citigroup Inc. said last week that most employees will be expected in the office only three days a week after the pandemic ends. Other banks, including Wells Fargo, have signaled they want to largely return to the way office life worked before the pandemic.</p><p>\"We believe most of us benefit by being physically together,\" said the memo, signed by Chief Executive Charles Scharf and Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell. \"Being pulled into meetings, learning from seeing how others work, and the often unplanned, casual interactions that occur when people see each other in the workplace can be really important.\"</p><p>Banks have reversed course on their office-return plans before, and Wells Fargo said it may change plans depending on the rate of coronavirus cases and vaccinations. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. began bringing back employees last fall, but a sharp uptick in coronavirus cases upended the plan.</p>",
