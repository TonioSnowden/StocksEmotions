  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: <strong>Tom Barrack</strong>, the former chief executive of <strong>Colony Capital</strong> who was one of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s earliest supporters in the 2016 presidential campaign, has been arrested and charged with illegally acting as an agent of the United Arab Emirates. Full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83e5dfbf-fb11-4f62-8242-920e817adea6\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The healthcare litigation company pushing the limits of Spac dealmaking</h2> <p>How does a company with no revenues earn a $33bn valuation? That's not a trick question. The answer is through a Spac.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>MSP Recovery</strong>, a litigation company founded by a well-known Miami lawyer named <strong>John Ruiz</strong>, announced last week it would go public in a merger with <strong>Lionheart Acquisition</strong>, a blank-cheque company set up by property developer <strong>Ophir Sternberg</strong>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210712005355/en/Lionheart-Acquisition-Corp.-II-Announces-Business-Combination-With-MSP-Recovery-a-Leader-in-Data-Driven-Solutions-Recovering-Improperly-Paid-Benefits-on-Behalf-of-Medicare-Medicaid-and-Commercial-Payers\">press release</a> caught our eye. It would be the second-largest Spac deal to date, behind <strong>Grab</strong> and <strong>Altimeter Growth</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">agreed upon a transaction</a> valuing the company at $40bn.</p> <p>For those lucky enough not to be familiar with the American healthcare system: MSP effectively makes its money by pursuing claims on behalf of US government-funded programmes, such as Medicaid or Medicare, when another insurer should've borne the costs.&#xa0;</p> <p>It would likely be difficult to argue that such a business model could earn a $33bn valuation.&#xa0;</p> <p>Income hinges on being able to win the cases, which can take years to litigate, and there are versions of it all over the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>But MSP says it offers more. Ruiz and a team of engineers have developed algorithms that can scour through medical records to find claims they can pursue.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001802450/000110465921090968/tm2121967d1_ex99-2.htm\">The presentation</a> is peppered with terms such as “disrupter”, “data analytics” and “technology moat”. Those claims can theoretically be turned into cash for the company and Ruiz's own law firm, which has the same name.</p> <p>For a deal of this size, we'd expect to see some sort of Pipe (private investment in public equity) transaction and the usual line-up of bulge bracket banks. But neither is present.</p> <p>MSP told the Financial Times it doesn't need a Pipe because it has enough money and is sitting on $50bn of claims.&#xa0;</p> <p>In fact, it has so little need for money that it has waived any requirement of a minimum amount of cash to be left in the Spac pot in order for the deal to go through.</p> <p>It sort of defeats the point of going public through a Spac, which gives early-stage companies access to crucial funds so they can go and achieve whatever targets they've set themselves.</p> <p>But MSP doesn't consider itself any old start-up. It lists private equity heavyweights such as <strong>Blackstone </strong>and <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> as its peers. The company argues that its $33bn valuation, which is 10.5 times the group's 2023 <em>projected </em>gross revenue for <em>potentially </em>recoverable claims, is in line with those peers.&#xa0;</p> <p>As DD's Ortenca Aliaj and Miles Kruppa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72b3f4ec-daad-4bc0-9f24-50222d4dcffb\">explain</a>, the deal came together after Ruiz and Sternberg met through a property deal.</p> <p>They co-own an apartment at the luxury waterfront <strong>Ritz-Carlton</strong> Residences in Miami Beach, which Sternberg's company developed with the help of hedge fund <strong>Elliott Management</strong>.</p> <p>While they were hashing out the MSP/Lionheart deal, they also acquired <strong>Cigarette Racing Team</strong>, a luxury boat company.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Those deals were private but MSP will find it hard to escape public scrutiny, especially in the current environment for Spacs.&#xa0;</p> <h2>India's IPO feast is served. Will investors bite?</h2> <p>Few sectors symbolised the cash-burning free-for-all in the Indian tech scene of recent years more than food delivery.</p> <p>In a furious bid for market share, leaders <strong>Zomato</strong> and<strong> Swiggy</strong> have aggressively <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04b95cc9-994e-46da-818e-3205cd72aaad\">expanded</a> into hundreds of cities, offering ever more audacious discounts — all while losing money on every order.</p> <p>Now the pair is gearing up for an even rowdier food fight.</p> <p>Swiggy raised $1.25bn on Tuesday from <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s second Vision Fund and<strong> Prosus</strong>, the Dutch-listed investment unit of South Africa's<strong> Naspers</strong>. Other investors like<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> and the <strong>Qatar Investment Authority </strong>participated in the round at a valuation of $5.5bn.</p> <p>Zomato, whose investors include <strong>Jack Ma</strong>'s <strong>Ant Group</strong>, is taking a different approach. Rather than looking to deep-pocketed foreign investors, it's betting that the Indian public will be willing to stomach its losses.</p> <p>The company has become the first of a generation of Indian start-ups to go public in what could prove a crucial test for India's young tech industry, the FT's Stephanie Findlay, Benjamin Parkin and Mercedes Ruehl <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6b35707-e7c5-4d30-8d11-5b8146183ca5\">report</a>. The industry's cash-burning businesses have until now been funded solely by private investors.</p> <p>Demand for Zomato's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8381383-a418-4db3-a38a-90fe10ecab17\">$1.25bn IPO</a>, which closed last week, outstripped supply by 38 times. The delivery group is seeking a valuation of up to $8bn, with shares debuting on Indian stock exchanges later this month.</p> <p>The company's economics have improved thanks to the boost to food delivery due to the pandemic. It is no longer bleeding money per order, but still reported a net loss of $100m for the year ended in March.&#xa0;</p> <p>With order values averaging about $5 in India, far below the $30 or more in the US, analysts are questioning whether the sector has a sustainable future.&#xa0;</p> <p>But with Indian shares breaking a series of highs in recent weeks and millions of new retail investors joining the frenzy, Zomato and its investors feel now is the time to strike.</p> <p>A number of richly valued Indian tech companies will be watching on closely, waiting in the wings for their own mooted listings.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08aef83c-7d1b-448c-8f77-7458177914ed\"><strong>Paytm</strong></a>, another Ant-backed fintech group, filed a prospectus last week for its own $2bn-plus IPO. Several other companies including <strong>Walmart</strong>-owned ecommerce group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9d27f05-6ed6-46bd-869d-74eaa85d9c00\"><strong>Flipkart</strong></a> are also expected to list in the not-too-distant future.</p> <p>Even Swiggy, Zomato's fierce rival, could be praying for its success. As one analyst said: “If they bottom out, then the entire sector gets a bad name.”</p> <h2>From Off-White to Etro, Arnault keeps consolidating</h2> <p>The wolf in cashmere is trying streetwear on for size. <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong> and his luxury empire <strong>LVMH</strong> have acquired a majority stake in menswear designer <strong>Virgil Abloh</strong>'s Off-White label.</p> <p>Abloh, a modern-day renaissance man touting titles including DJ, visual artist and industrial designer, will see his existing role as artistic director at <strong>Louis Vuitton </strong>menswear expanded to launch new brands and partnerships with existing brands “beyond the realm of fashion”.</p> <p>The French conglomerate has increased its stake in Off-White to a majority 60 per cent, with Abloh retaining the remaining 40 per cent.</p> <p>While the terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, the deal may carry more weight symbolically, locking in Abloh as a top designer at the luxury group as it seeks to “disrupt” a number of its businesses through an outsider's perspective.&#xa0;</p> <p>Abloh was the first black creative director of Louis Vuitton and one of few at the helm of a big European fashion house alongside <strong>Balmain</strong>'s <strong>Olivier Rousteing</strong>. Building new brands will also enable him to bring in talent and help the luxury industry become “more diverse”, Abloh told the FT's Lauren Indvik.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>L Catterton</strong>, the private equity firm backed by LVMH, has acquired a 60 per cent stake in Italian fashion group <strong>Etro</strong>. The deal comes months after the fund's €4bn purchase of German footwear group <strong>Birkenstock</strong>, underlining Arnault's insatiable appetite for dealmaking.</p> <p>It's critical to point out that despite LVMH's dealmaking tear, these transactions are not mega moves for the luxury group. But from a branding and cultural perspective, they're beginning to move the needle.</p> <p>Given Abloh's penchant for sold-out collaborations, like his luggage line with LVMH-owned <strong>Rimowa</strong>, it's clear Arnault senses an opportunity.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> has <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/fb3396a0-93f6-43b0-ae6b-1ddaab452787\">nominated</a> <strong>Jonathan Kanter</strong>, who has represented many of Big Tech's fiercest rivals, to head the US justice department's antitrust division, presenting yet another potential challenge to Silicon Valley's largest companies.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>ExxonMobil</strong> has hired former <strong>Diageo</strong> chief financial officer <strong>Kathryn Mikells</strong> as its new finance chief, succeeding <strong>Andrew Swiger</strong>, a 43-year veteran of the company.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f7b8453-3bd5-40b8-b4e4-a97d2c0a829e\">has named</a> <strong>Jean-Francois Astier</strong> and <strong>John Miller </strong>as its new co-heads of investment banking as part of a broader shake-up of the division. They are both based in New York, emphasising the primacy of the US for the London-headquartered bank.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan </strong>has hired <strong>Reinout Böttcher</strong> as vice-chair of Emea investment banking. He joins from <strong>UBS</strong> where he was head of global banking for Switzerland.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> has named <strong>Arianna Simpson </strong>as general partner for the a16z crypto investment fund. She previously ran her own fund called <strong>Autonomous Partners</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Future of fashion</strong> Inditex has revolutionised retail through a hybrid model in which brick-and-mortar stores double as mini-distribution centers. Yet the Spanish group behind Zara's sustainability and labour practices are cemented in the past.

But even its high-profile connections held little sway against Beijing's iron fist.
