  "title": "VC Analysts Ponder How to Blend Last Year's Dazzling Numbers Into Usable Forecasts; ‘Any comparison to the 2021 venture-capital boom yields skewed results,' one analyst sums up. And decisions on whether to step back, stand pat or move forward with funding can rest on those results",
  "text": "<p>Analysts have been puzzling over how best to integrate the bulging figures of 2021's frenzied deal-making into long-term outlooks without warping their forecasts. On top of that, any chart comparing this year's VC performance to last year's makes it look like everything's in free fall.</p><p>\"I am disregarding the hallucinatory valuation environment of 2021,\" said Gene Frantz, general partner at CapitalG, an independent growth fund of Google parent company Alphabet Inc.</p><p>The comparison to last year also belittles what has been a hardy performance this year, analysts note: Many areas of the VC market remain near historic highs or are even trending up—if you factor out 2021.</p><p>At Dealroom.co, an Amsterdam-based market data firm, \"despite the downturn\" has become a banned phrase, said Founder Yoram Wijngaarde.</p><p>\"It's important not to ignore the hysteria of last year,\" he said. \"But the gloomy year-on-year reporting in 2022, aside from getting a bit samey, doesn't really tell the full story either.\"</p><p>Neil Shah, director of investment research at research and consulting firm Edison Group, concurred. \"Any comparison to the 2021 venture-capital boom yields skewed results,\" he said.</p><p>\"It might be helpful to include footnotes pointing to the reasons for such irregular figures,\" Mr. Shah said, \"while also comparing new VC data to prepandemic years, in order to retain a sense of proportion.\"</p><p>Venture-backed startups are generally insulated from what have recently been tempestuous public markets, in part because their valuations aren't determined by daily trading. As well, venture investors typically take a longer perspective and don't expect returns for several years to come.</p><p>Startups worldwide this year raised $108.5 billion in venture funding in the second quarter, a cave-in of nearly 40% from the end of last year and a six-quarter low, according to market research firm CB Insights.</p><p>But it was also the sixth-largest quarter for funding on record, the firm said.</p><p>Other figures are similarly misleading. For instance, the median valuation for early-stage U.S. startups \"slid back\" to $52 million over the second quarter this year—the third-highest level on record—after surging to $62 million in the first quarter on residual momentum from 2021, according to a report by analytics firm PitchBook Data Inc. and the National Venture Capital Association, an industry trade group.</p><p>Or take mega-rounds. In the first half of this year, 362 early-stage U.S. startups closed funding rounds of $100 million or more, the report says. That's far less than the 842 of 2021—on a chart, it looks like mega-rounds have fallen off a cliff. But the half-year mark for 2022 is already ahead of the 333 for all of 2020.</p><p>Like the broader tech sector, Covid-19 drove soaring demand for startups developing apps that supported everything from remote work to food deliveries, gaming, cryptocurrencies and other sought-after products and services. As economies emerged from the pandemic, demand for these and other tools has ebbed, while higher interest rates, inflation and fears of recession have prompted investors to pull back on risky bets.</p><p>\"It's probably an overstatement to say that the sky is falling, and more that investments and valuations are coming back to earth,\" said Brian Lee, senior vice president of CB Insights Intelligence Unit. \"We need to put things in perspective.\"</p><p>To account for wild swings in data—in charts, trend lines and long-term projections—most market analysts seem to fall somewhere between adopting a broader historical perspective on market dynamics, or dampening the impact of 2021 by reverting the data to a mean.</p><p>The strategies are critical to making multimillion-dollar investing decisions in the months and years ahead, as investors try to take the guesswork out of stepping back, standing pat or charging ahead on a new funding round.</p><p>Some analysts are simply excluding the figures from their calculations, like Mr. Frantz of CapitalG. Others are using a longer timeline.</p><p>\"The 2000 bubble was a tech-centric mania; the 2007 boom was driven by the housing bubble; 2021's bubble was driven by excessive monetary stimulus and federal stimulus,\" said Steve Brotman, founding partner of Alpha Partners.</p><p>\"It's often said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\" he added. Still, \"it's safe to say that this set of circumstances is highly unlikely to repeat itself,\" he said.</p><p>For market watchers, one of the hardest parts of dealing with 2021 data is the lack of clear benchmarks, said Kyle Stanford, PitchBook's senior venture capital analyst. \"Different years have produced very different metrics in terms of activity,\" Mr. Stanford said. \"Are valuations resetting to 2020? 2018? 2013?\"</p><p>Tomasz Tunguz, managing director of Redpoint Ventures, said \"in every regard 2021 was off the charts,\" citing dollars raised, dollars invested, valuations and exits. \"I've just started drawing trend lines through charts to show the reversion to the mean,\" Mr. Tunguz said.</p><p>Pamela Aldsworth, head of venture capital coverage for J.P. Morgan Commercial Banking, said last year's giant funding rounds and towering valuations stemmed from an influx of nontraditional players to venture capital, such as giant hedge funds and other institutional investors, creating conditions that are unlikely to recur anytime soon.</p><p>\"In our view, we're in the early stages of a healthy resetting of the bar within the venture ecosystem,\" Ms. Aldsworth said. For now, no one really knows how to deal with the wild swings in 2021 market data, she added.</p><p>In addition to analysts and investors, startup founders are also struggling with an unfamiliar sense of uncertainty, said Maëlle Gavet, chief executive of Techstars.</p><p>\"What we should be reflecting on is the unusualness of how extremely long of a bull run we have had in venture,\" Ms. Gavet said. \"It is important to note that there are many people working in tech and venture capital that have only known a bull market.\"</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p>",
