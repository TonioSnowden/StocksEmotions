  "text": "<p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 rose 173 points, or 0.5% to 34312.</p><p>Futures on the S&amp;P 500 ES00 gained 25.75 points, or 0.6%, to 4419.</p><p>Futures on the Nasdaq 100 NQ00 increased 109 points, or 0.8% to 14054.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 88 points, or 0.26%, to 34220, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 15 points, or 0.34%, to 4397, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 40 points, or 0.3%, to 13372.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>First-quarter earnings season gets underway with results from JPMorgan Chase JPM, Delta Air Lines DAL and BlackRock BLK.</p><p>Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, notes that consensus earnings expectations for the S&amp;P 500 this year have actually moved higher, to $230 in April from $224 in January.</p><p>“Given the myriad headwinds faced by companies in the first quarter and the year ahead, we think first-quarter reporting season has the potential to be a mess. But we also see the potential for it to not be as bad as feared, given the likelihood that buy-side expectations are much lower than official sell-side forecasts – as long as robust assessments of underlying appetite/demand remain in place,” she said.</p><p>Overseas developments meanwhile brought the inflation, and rate-hike, stories back into focus. The U.K. reported the fastest inflation rate in 30 years, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made a stronger-than-forecast half-point rate hike. The Bank of Canada also is expected to lift rates by a half-point.</p><p>The U.S. economic calendar features producer prices, a day after the Labor Department reported the strongest year-over-year rise in consumer prices in 40 years, at 8.5%.</p><p>The CPI data showed a 0.9% drop in durable-goods inflation, at the same time there was a 0.7% gain in services inflation, both evidence of a normalizing economy after pandemic supply disruptions.</p><p>“These core inflation dynamics suggest that underlying price pressures are peaking in the U.S.,” said analysts at BCA Research.</p>",
