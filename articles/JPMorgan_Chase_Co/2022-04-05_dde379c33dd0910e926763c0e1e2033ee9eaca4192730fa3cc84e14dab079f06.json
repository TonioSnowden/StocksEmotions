  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>American football star <strong>Tom Brady </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ffb95c8-d423-40c7-be90-560835af2ce1\">has joined<strong> Consello</strong></a>, the new venture from the disgraced public relations guru Declan Kelly who quit Teneo last year after sexual harassment allegations.</p> <h2>Abramovich's diplomatic voyage</h2> <p><strong>Roman Abramovich's </strong>allies paint him as a philanthropist and football enthusiast who flung himself into attempts to stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>His critics say he's a cunning businessman who, having made his money from buying oil group <strong>Sibneft </strong>in an auction (which critics allege was rigged), <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7315885-0ee4-49d4-98d1-292e5225be06\">would do almost anything</a> to preserve his carefully-constructed life in the West and salvage his overseas assets.</p> <p>The role played by <strong>Chelsea Football Club's</strong> owner in Russia-Ukraine peace talks, which <strong>Vladimir Putin </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/260fb656-4010-4ffe-96be-a273ec87792b\">personally approved</a>, remains unclear, according to a source sympathetic to the Russian billionaire, who spoke to the FT for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d80a42c1-bd1f-48e1-8dcf-f01ebdb304fb\">this deep-dive</a> by DD's Arash Massoudi and a team of colleagues. </p> <p>“Could it be a double agenda? Sure, but who else could do that — to help Ukraine and stop Russia?” the person close to him said. “Roman's the only one who's trying.”</p> <p>Orphaned from the age of three, Abramovich found his way into oil trading after the collapse of the Soviet Union and — thanks to a chance encounter in 1994 with the Russian tycoon <strong>Boris Berezovsky </strong>— was well placed to take advantage of the country's pawning of its crown jewels. </p> <p>During that period of turbulence, Abramovich acquired Sibneft with Berezovsky for about $200mn, a fraction of the $13bn for which he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1aee02b4-3016-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8\">sell it to state-owned <strong>Gazprom</strong></a> in 2005, a deal that provides the source of most of Abramovich's wealth. </p> <p>“He was a shadowy tycoon from Siberia [ . . .] then all of a sudden he is a legitimate British businessman with a fat cheque underwritten by the Russian government,” said <strong>Roman Borisovich</strong>, a former Russian banker turned anti-corruption campaigner.</p> <p>The so-called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Abramovich-Billionaire-Nowhere-Dominic-Midgley/dp/1908291583\">“Billionaire from Nowhere”</a> played down any suggestion that he was a close confidant of Putin as he snapped up a £200mn portfolio of UK property, various megayachts and the football club that made him a household name in Britain. (Side note: his 15-bedroom mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens was formerly the Soviet embassy.) </p> <p>But as his Londongrad empire came under fire, Abramovich flipped the script that he had written for himself, using his personal relationship with Putin as his trump card and a source of leverage as a peacemaker as he jetted between Moscow, Israel and Turkey and even Kyiv. </p> <p>“It looks like they have much closer relations than I believed. He was always closer to Putin than me, but I didn't think he was this close,” said one oligarch who has known both men since the 1990s. “Nobody was aware. Nobody else could play this role.”</p> <p>As Abramovich shuttles around, so too do some of his yachts. He owns or is linked to five yachts estimated to be worth almost $1bn, including several whose ownership remained secret until the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a06e03a-4e0b-4ed1-b0fa-c94323b14356\">FT first reported</a> about their existence last week. </p> <p>Solaris, which he reportedly owns, left a Turkish marina on Monday after the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d992840-8c7f-4044-b5aa-1db80586716a\">reported</a> lawyers' views that the UK-listed operator of the port risked violating sanctions by harbouring the vessel.</p> <h2>Northstar goes south</h2> <p>In November 2020, <strong>SoftBank</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c\">lifted the lid</a> for the first time on <strong>SB Northstar</strong>, a buccaneering internal hedge fund run by <strong>Akshay Naheta</strong>, a then 39-year-old ex-<strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> trader based in Abu Dhabi. </p> <p>Seventeen months on, the unit has turned out to be an astonishingly fast way of burning through eye-watering sums of cash. </p> <p>In its short life it has managed to rack up between $6bn and $7bn in losses, much of which comes from the disastrous “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2\"><strong>Nasdaq</strong> whale</a>” trade which SoftBank sources have pinned on <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> himself. (Son said in November that he would personally bear a large chunk of Northstar's losses, though it's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BondHack/status/1510217820965150722?s=20&amp;t=AykAAS46Xj9vogtd40RT_A\">not entirely clear</a> when SoftBank will collect the money.) </p> <p>Now, it's game over for Northstar. Naheta left SoftBank last Thursday and almost all of the hedge fund's positions have been liquidated, DD's Rob Smith and Arash Massoudi and the FT's Antoni Slodkowski <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/197c32a9-cfed-418c-9351-ec8eefe54328\">report</a>. </p> <p>As Naheta departs, it's worth looking back over some of his most intricate trades.</p> <p>One was a 2019 deal in which SoftBank Investment Advisers structured a €900mn convertible bond investment in <strong>Wirecard</strong>, the German group that has since collapsed in a massive fraud. At the same time, SoftBank said it would pursue a “strategic co-operation agreement” with the payments company. </p> <p>It came immediately after FT reports raised serious doubts about the validity of Wirecard's accounting, and provided a significant vote of confidence after which shares rallied. </p> <p>Within hours of the deal closing, SoftBank effectively took its money off the table via a sale of new bonds to a broad group of investors, carried out by <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>. But it retained exposure to Wirecard's rising shares — though they ultimately collapsed, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars of paper profits. </p> <p>Another of Naheta's deals was SoftBank's bet on <strong>THG</strong>, the Manchester-based purveyor of make-up and protein powder.</p> <p>Last year SoftBank injected $730mn into London-listed THG as the cornerstone investor in a $1bn capital raise. At the same time it announced it had an option to buy a stake in the company's third-party ecommerce and logistics unit, <strong>Ingenuity</strong>, at a dizzying $6bn valuation. </p> <p>The option arrangement helped hand SoftBank an instant gain on its investment — on a day when THG stock might have fallen, given the equity raise was diluting existing shareholders — though THG's shares have since plummeted. </p> <p>SoftBank still holds the position in THG, having shifted it to SoftBank Group. But it's hard to imagine it using that option, now that THG's entire market cap has slid to about £1.2bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Andreas Hansson</strong>, a SoftBank executive and THG board member, is due to leave the Japanese group at the end of April, according to people familiar with the matter. </p> <h2>Musk takes his Twitter habit to the next level</h2> <p>Is <strong>Elon Musk</strong> setting the stage for a massive leveraged buyout, or just trolling <strong>Twitter</strong> by investing cash he has kicking around to buy 9.2 per cent of the company?</p> <p>On Monday morning, Musk, the man behind perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b2aca5c-d14e-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\">costliest tweet</a> in history, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c49c814-b797-4668-be79-b5e1f2f2fc2f\">disclosed</a> a $2.9bn passive investment in Twitter. The announcement sent the tech group's shares soaring 27 per cent and Lex wondering whether he might try to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22683321-b221-4a0d-8dfc-85562f4e2fe2\">buy the company outright</a>.</p> <p>Musk, chief executive officer of <strong>Tesla</strong> and <strong>SpaceX</strong>, is inserting himself into a company that has long frustrated shareholders and drawn in investment from two of Wall Street's most influential investors.</p> <p>Two years ago, activist investment firm <strong>Elliott</strong> <strong>Management</strong> and private equity giant <strong>Silver Lake</strong> invested $1bn in Twitter and took board seats as the struggling social network began planning a succession from co-founder <strong>Jack</strong> <strong>Dorsey</strong>. </p> <p>Elliott's <strong>Jesse</strong> <strong>Cohn</strong> was given a board seat he relinquished a year later, while Silver Lake's co-chief <strong>Egon</strong> <strong>Durban</strong> was named a director, a position he retains. </p> <p>In November, Dorsey resigned as chief executive and was replaced by <strong>Parag</strong> <strong>Agrawal</strong>, its former chief technology officer. Then came a tech sell-off that halved Twitter's stock from the prior year. </p> <p>Enter Musk, who in late 2021, sold more than $16bn in Tesla stock, then bottom fished on Twitter.</p> <p>It's unclear what comes next. Is he plotting something more ambitious, or just trolling his 80mn followers?</p> <p>On one hand, Musk attempted to pull off a buyout of Tesla on Twitter, with his infamous “funding secured” tweet in 2018, which came moments after an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42ca6c42-a79e-11e8-926a-7342fe5e173f\">FT scoop</a> on Saudi Arabia investing in the electric carmaker.</p> <p>“I'm excited to work with Silver Lake and<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> as financial advisers, plus<strong> Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz </strong>and<strong> Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson</strong> as legal advisers, on the proposal to take Tesla private,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1029171381584314368?s=20&amp;t=ZJj4N3wAd_wkRd_Y_cY6lA\">he tweeted</a> on the ordeal.</p> <p>The deal never materialised and the <strong>SEC</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbca8b7c-c293-11e8-8d55-54197280d3f7\">ultimately charged</a> Musk over his tweets which it said contained “a series of false and misleading statements”. The suit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b2aca5c-d14e-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\">was settled</a> with Musk paying millions in fines and agreeing to a monitor of his tweets, but not admitting to violations.</p> <p>Now Musk carries about a $300bn net worth and basically anything is possible, even a Twitter takeover. </p> <p>Don't discount the other characters involved with Twitter. Elliott has organised more than $30bn in buyouts in 2022 alone, while Silver Lake was an architect of <strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Dell's</strong> $67bn takeover of <strong>EMC</strong> in 2016. Maybe, this time round, Musk actually has funding secured.</p> <p><strong>Job moves&#xa0;</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Sequoia Capital </strong>partner<strong> Roelof Botha</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b0e34a3-daf2-4f7b-b185-42142e52add5\">will enter the venture capital firm's top job</a> as senior steward, replacing<strong> Doug Leone</strong>, who will remain on as a general partner.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Rodolfo Landim</strong>, the president of Rio de Janeiro football club <strong>Flamengo</strong>, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe6b1221-50c8-4bcb-8942-4709ef0b951b\">rejected</a> a job as chair of Brazil's largest company <strong>Petrobras</strong> that the government nominated him for, saying he wants to concentrate on the sports team. </p></li>  <li><p>Former<strong> Morgan Stanley</strong> in-house counsel <strong>Stephen Morris</strong> has joined law firm <strong>Katten </strong>as a partner in New York. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has hired<strong> Katherine Rocco</strong> as an antitrust partner based in New York, focusing on private equity.
