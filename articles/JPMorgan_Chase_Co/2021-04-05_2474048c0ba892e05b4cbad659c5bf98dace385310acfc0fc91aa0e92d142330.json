  "text": "<p>Greensill's implosion has ensnared a raft of financial firms, including Credit Suisse Group AG, which froze $10 billion of funds it manages with the firm. Regulators have taken over supervision of Greensill's German bank after they said a special audit found suspicious accounting related to Mr. Gupta. The move came despite a last-ditch attempt by SoftBank Group Corp., Greensill's largest external investor, to intervene directly with the regulator.</p><p>For GFG Alliance, which houses the Gupta family's steel, aluminum and energy businesses and generates annual revenue of $20 billion, its main source of funding suddenly dried up.</p><p>Mr. Greensill set up Greensill Capital in 2011 to provide clients with supply-chain finance -- a form of short-term lending to help companies pay their suppliers on time.</p><p>Mr. Gupta -- formerly in commodities trading -- entered the steel business in 2013 hoping to revive unloved industrial assets. He found an industry in constant need of working capital, where suppliers and customers often pay late and traditional lenders steer clear.</p><p>\"When I started my journey back in 2013, there was [sic] few options available in terms of traditional finance. . .Greensill came as a breath of fresh air,\" Mr. Gupta said in a podcast aimed at GFG staff that was published last Saturday. GFG says it is seeking alternative sources of funding and that its companies are performing well amid strong markets for steel and other products.</p><p>Messrs. Greensill and Gupta, the latter through GFG, declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Mr. Gupta, the son of an Indian industrialist with ambitions to make steel in a more environmentally friendly way, is charismatic, charming and would sometimes invite his staff to family dinners, people who know him said. Mr. Greensill, who grew up on a farm in Australia, is a more staid figure but also an ambitious, aggressive risk taker, people who have worked with him said.</p><p>People familiar with the pair's relationship said Mr. Greensill often visited Mr. Gupta to talk business at his large glass-walled office overlooking Sydney Harbour, while the banker invited the industrialist to his family farm, where they would discuss deals on a hill overlooking the estate.</p><p>Greensill executives attended big parties Mr. Gupta threw at his rented mansion in an expensive part of Sydney, some of the people said.</p><p>In August 2016, Mr. Gupta bought a stake in Greensill, before selling it back later that year.</p><p>That year, Mr. Gupta also embarked on his most ambitious deal yet, buying an aluminum smelter and its hydroelectric power supplier in Scotland.</p><p>The GBP 330 million deal, equivalent to $454.8 million, was one of several major GFG transactions funded by loans from Greensill. By 2017, GFG accounted for 69% of the lender's revenue, according to an internal memo from SoftBank's Vision Fund, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>In a phone call with SoftBank, Mr. Gupta explained that while traditional lenders were cheaper, Greensill was faster and more flexible, according to a summary of that conversation contained in the memo.</p><p>Increasingly, GFG executives and advisers were concerned about the reliance on Greensill. By 2018 they persuaded Mr. Gupta to consolidate his holdings into one group, release a single set of financials, bring in long-term debt from banks and eventually go public, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>But the following year GFG made its biggest acquisition yet, paying 740 million euros, equivalent to $868.1 million, for seven European assets from steel giant ArcelorMittal PLC.</p><p>GFG held talks with U.S. investment bank Jefferies over a potential bond sale to help fund the deal but dropped the idea when Mr. Gupta balked at some of the terms, the people said.</p><p>In general, he didn't like covenants, which often come with loans and bonds and impose conditions on a borrower. In particular, Mr. Gupta railed against conditions that prevented him from moving money around his empire, one of the people said.</p><p>GFG moved tens of millions of dollars, for instance, from its profitable Australian businesses to less lucrative British ones and to help fund the 2017 takeover of a steel mill in South Carolina, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>In the end, the acquisition of ArcelorMittal's assets was mainly financed by Greensill, the people added. Jefferies declined to comment.</p><p>A spokesman for GFG said it has over time used a range of financing tools, including bonds, bank loans and asset-based financing.</p><p>Mr. Gupta has previously said he wanted to list his Australian and U.S. assets. However, bankers at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., who were set to help list the Australian assets, told Mr. Gupta he first needed to reduce his reliance on short-term finance, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>JPMorgan declined to comment. GFG hasn't listed any business.</p><p>As of September 2019, Greensill was lending around $7.4 billion to Mr. Gupta's companies, a Greensill document shows. That month, Mr. Greensill told the Journal in an interview that he was a \"big fan\" of Mr. Gupta and his attempts to revive industry in the West.</p><p>At the same time Greensill's senior management were receiving regular updates on the firm's GFG exposure and Mr. Greensill was telling executives that he hoped to \"outgrow\" GFG, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>But GFG remained crucially important to Greensill, typically generating about a third of its total revenue, according to internal Greensill documents reviewed by the Journal.</p><p>Greensill was also coming under pressure from German bank regulator BaFin to reduce exposure to GFG at Greensill Bank, according to a statement that Mr. Greensill made as part of the company's insolvency process. A September 2019 internal Greensill document shows that 85% of the bank's assets were linked to GFG.</p><p>Last fall, Greensill hired banks to help it raise up to $1 billion in fresh equity. But in December, a private-equity firm that had been expected to invest pulled out in part because of BaFin's concerns over exposure to GFG, according to the statement from Mr. Greensill in relation to the insolvency filing.</p>",
