  "text": "<p>Yet there were signs some investors could be steering a bit more money out of stocks, as Bank of America's Flow Show reported that $15.2 billion was allocated to cash in the latest week, the biggest influx in five weeks. The week saw $12.7 billion allocated to equities, $12.6 billion to bonds, but $200 million out of gold GC00, which is traditionally viewed as a haven for investors worried about an economic slowdown.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained nearly 20% so far this year, which is ahead of a 16% return in 2020, though below a 28% return in 2019. On a continous basis, gold has dropped 5% this year, versus a 24% rise in 2020.</p><p>Stragetists at JPMorgan also recently commented on the rush into stocks, noting that the flows have been driven by retail investors.</p>",
