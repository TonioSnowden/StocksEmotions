  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is poised along with other investors to take control of bankrupt driller Nine Point Energy Holdings Inc., which has been flaring natural gas in North Dakota at rates that exceed state guidelines.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase is financing the nation's largest coal producer, Peabody Energy Corp., and extended it a lifeline that lasts through the end of 2024, a year after its self-imposed deadline for phasing out its credit exposure to the coal industry.</p><p>ESG can be difficult to clearly define and \"we need to be realistic about fossil fuel and even coal usage for applications where there is no substitute,\" said Barry Kupferberg, managing partner of Barkers Point Capital Advisors, an investment banking and advisory firm focused on energy transition companies. \"This inevitably leads to decisions and positions that can appear inconsistent with stated goals,\" he said.</p><p>Such decisions can open banks up to criticism from environmentalists.</p><p>\"Wall Street firms have been making splashy sustainability commitments, but as long as they continue to back failing fossil fuel companies, these commitments aren't worth much,\" Ben Cushing, a campaign manager at environmental group Sierra Club, said, speaking in general about big banks that espouse environmental goals.</p><p>In their most recent public reports regarding their respective environmental, social, and governance policies, both Goldman and JPMorgan laid out goals, targets and commitments to investing in environmentally sustainable industries and to reducing their involvement in carbon-intensive ones, particularly in companies that are known for causing especially high levels of pollution.</p><p>A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said that, as a lender to Nine Point, the bank doesn't have authority to make decisions for the company. But Goldman Sachs has \"engaged\" with Nine Point and is pleased to learn that the company's recent flaring activity has declined, she said.</p><p>JPMorgan declined to comment on its lifeline to Peabody. The extended financing is part of a larger set of transactions designed to help the company avoid a repeat chapter 11 filing as it contends with conditions that have sent the coal industry into long-term decline.</p>",
