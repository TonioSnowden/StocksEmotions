  "text": "<p>Wall Street's deal-making boom is starting to fade. Morgan's Stanley's fees from brokering mergers and fundraisings fell 37% in its first quarter, as corporate chiefs hung back from volatile markets. Investing banking fees were down 43% at Citigroup Inc., 36% at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and 31% at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Morgan Stanley and other major U.S. banks also reported double-digit drops in first-quarter profit, hurt by inflation, but trading desks benefitted from volatility. Morgan Stanley's trading revenue was up 4%. Morgan Stanley shares added 0.8% Thursday.</p><p>ETSY INC.</p><p>ETSY -3.6%</p><p>Etsy sellers have a new craft: protesting higher costs. More than 20,000 sellers on the digital marketplace signed a petition in opposition to increasing fees and changes. Some are also temporarily closing their shops in response to Etsy raising the commission it charges on each transaction to 6.5% from 5%, which executives say is critical to increasing investments in marketing and expanding seller-support services. The tension between the company and some of its roughly 5.3 million sellers comes as Etsy tries to evolve into a major e-commerce player. Etsy shares lost 3.6% Tuesday.</p><p>TWITTER INC.</p><p>TWTR -1.7%</p><p>The richest man in the world wants Twitter. It's not clear whether he will get it. Elon Musk on Thursday made a $43 billion bid for the social-media company, but Twitter on Friday adopted a so-called poison pill to prevent a takeover. The offer from Tesla's CEO came after the billionaire reversed a decision to join Twitter's board. Twitter shares fell 1.7% Thursday.</p><p>DELTA AIR LINES INC.</p><p>DAL +6.2%</p><p>Delta expects flight demand to soar this summer. The airline reported on Wednesday a $940 million quarterly loss, but said it returned to profitability during March and expects to report a profit in the second quarter. Inflation and higher fares aren't keeping customers away as they prioritize spending on travel, in some cases after a two-year break, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said. Rising jet-fuel prices amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine are now one of the biggest threats to airline profits, but executives are confident they can weather them. Delta shares jumped 6.2% Wednesday.</p><p>BED BATH &amp; BEYOND INC.</p><p>BBBY -1.2%</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond didn't clean up in the last quarter. The home goods chain reported another disappointing period of declining sales, raising pressure on the retailer to demonstrate that its turnaround plan is on track. Chief Executive Mark Tritton said supply-chain delays cost the retailer $175 million in lost sales and many key categories were missing more than a third of goods. Executives also warned of a slowdown in consumer spending and said the company wouldn't be able to raise prices enough to offset inflation. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares fell 1.2% Wednesday.</p><p>PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC.</p><p>PTON +5.6%</p><p>An activist investor says Peloton is spinning its wheels. Blackwells Capital on Wednesday pushed for Peloton to consider a sale, saying in a presentation that the fitness equipment company hasn't made enough progress under new CEO Barry McCarthy. Peloton soared as the pandemic fueled massive demand for its exercise bikes, but the company now is struggling as people venture outside. On Thursday, the company said it would cut prices of its stationary bikes and treadmills and raise monthly subscriptions for online workout classes. Peloton shares gained 5.6% Wednesday.</p><p>ALPHABET INC.</p><p>GOOG +1.5%</p><p>Google is betting on the office. The Alphabet unit plans to invest about $9.5 billion in U.S. offices and data centers this year, up from $7 billion in 2021, as it opens new branches and expands facilities. Google said Wednesday that the investment in more than a dozen states will create at least 12,000 new full-time jobs by the end of the year. The search-engine giant plans to open a new office in Atlanta, boost its presence in New York, build out its campus in Boulder, Colo., and invest in data centers across the U.S. Alphabet shares gained 1.5% Wednesday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
