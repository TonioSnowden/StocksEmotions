  "title": "Wall Street's New Rivalry: Who  Can See the Most People in Person  ---  Dealmakers get back on the road, and  JPMorgan awards points for meetings  ----  By Cara Lombardo and David Benoit",
  "text": "<p>   Wall Street investment bankers are well-accustomed to jockeying for multimillion-dollar fees on corporate deals. Now, the game is focused on just showing up. </p><p>   After more than a year of Zoom, Wall Street's elite are beginning to emerge from behind their screens and returning to the timeworn custom of in-person client visits, handshakes and wine-soaked dinners. </p><p>   Rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which have already brought their employees back to the office faster than the rest of Wall Street, are urging their bankers to get out and visit boldfaced corporate clients -- and quickly, before others do. </p><p>   Goldman chief David Solomon began touting the importance of traveling to see clients as soon as New York state quarantine restrictions softened in early April, people close to him say. He modeled the desired behavior himself, asking bankers if they had clients he should visit while he was making trips to places such as Florida and California on his corporate jet. This prompted senior bankers, many of whom had been holed up in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, to hit the pavement. </p><p>   JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon sprung into action and began pushing the firm's fleet of private jets on managing directors, saying, \"If you need to use a plane to go see a client, use it. There are no excuses,\" according to a person familiar with the chief executive's communication. </p><p>   The effort intensified when Fernando Rivas, JPMorgan's head of North America investment banking, set up a contest to get bankers on the road again. </p><p>   The game, which ran during the month of June, awarded senior bankers 10 points for proper face time with CEOs outside their offices, seven for attending board meetings in-person, five for visiting CEOs in their offices, three for CFOs and one for other senior executives such as heads of corporate development, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   For investment bankers used to year-end bonuses that can top $1 million, the stakes were small by comparison: The top point earners would get a dinner with Mr. Rivas and Carlos Hernandez, the executive chair of the investment bank. Still, that didn't stop the gamesmanship from taking flight. </p><p>   One technology banker, Rod Reed, racked up points by hosting a cocktail reception at his San Francisco-area home with several CEOs present, including Mr. Dimon, some of the people said. That prompted eye-rolls from some colleagues and helped propel him to a win. In addition to Mr. Reed, the other winners named this month at an internal meeting were Andy Rabin, a top regional investment banker; Matt Seiter, a technology banker; and Phil Ross, who specializes in healthcare. The four winners declined to comment, through a company spokeswoman. </p><p>   The game seemed to serve its purpose. The bank recorded more than 1,000 total in-person meetings for the month, Mr. Rivas said in an interview, adding that they were often first to see clients in person since the pandemic hit. </p><p>   Bank CEOs are getting in on the action too. </p><p>   Mr. Dimon, who wasn't earning points in the game, in late June went to Paris and Rome, winning face time with French President Emmanuel Macron, who came to the opening of the bank's new office, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. </p><p>   But Mr. Dimon skipped what was supposed to be a stop in London, unwilling to lock himself down for the required quarantine in the U.K., according to someone familiar with his itinerary. </p><p>   Around the same time, Citigroup Inc.'s Jane Fraser did the quarantine, staying in a London hotel for her five required days on her first international trip as CEO. She cooked her own meals on a small two-burner stove and caught up on some light television (NCIS) and heavy reading (\"Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788\" by Pauline Maier). Things generally went smoothly except when her monitor went dark during an address to the bank's 210,000 employees. (She kept speaking.) </p><p>   Once free, she said it was worth it to return to Citigroup's Canary Wharf offices, see clients and officials from Bank of England and Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer. Meetings would run long, but few had other places to be. Plus, there was no traffic, she said. </p><p>   Though Ms. Fraser made it a point to make personal visits, Citigroup isn't requiring its bankers to start traveling again. Ms. Fraser said the bank won't be tracking banker meetings with clients and will instead focus on the quality of the relationship. She says it will help Citigroup recruit. </p><p>   The mood is a swift reversal from the early days of the pandemic. When merger-and-acquisition activity screeched to a halt in the spring of 2020, many investment bankers had flashbacks to previous crises and thought about dusting off their resumes. Instead, activity came roaring back in the second half of the year, with a string of megadeals and a SPAC merger bonanza. </p><p>   At a recent meeting with industry bankers, American Airlines Group Inc. CEO Doug Parker said the ones who had led the company's $10 billion debt deal in March were those who had come to visit him. American hired Goldman and Barclays PLC for the deal. \"Do you know how many bankers showed up the next week?\" the airline's finance chief, Derek Kerr, said at an industry conference in May. \"Every other one.\" </p><p>   Ben Metzger, Barclays' head banker for the transportation industry, said many of his recent in-person meetings were more social than PowerPoint-driven. After a record-breaking year for his team, it is working through a backlog of dinners to celebrate closing deals. That means the Lucite trinkets commemorating deals are stacking up again too. \"I had clients saying to me, 'Where is my dinner and deal toy?'\" Mr. Metzger says. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Alison Sider contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
