  "text": "<p>Top executives at Goldman Sachs are firm believers in the benefits of bankers working together in offices, but they are now taking a different view of festive gatherings. </p> <p>With Covid-19 cases resurgent, the Wall Street bank has ordered teams in New York to cancel any remaining party plans, according to people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>Goldman has held holiday parties over the last several weeks and a few remaining ones have been postponed, a bank spokeswoman said. </p> <p>Goldman's new, stricter policy reveals a divide on Wall Street over group gatherings for the festive season after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">gruelling</a>, albeit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c4638b-2663-4fa2-9fa3-8608d488d227\">lucrative</a>, year for the finance industry. </p> <p>High rates of vaccination in New York and loosening social restrictions gave many bankers hope that they would be able to hold celebrations this year. However, new concerns over the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6f81103-fcd1-4255-8633-a7d73932b1bf\">Omicron variant </a>have complicated plans for a second December in a row.</p> <p>While Goldman is now taking a conservative stance on festivities, some rivals are showing more flexibility. Both JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are allowing individual teams and departments to move ahead with their own parties, in the absence of a company-wide bash, according to several bankers.</p> <p>JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</p> <p>The smaller-scale dinner parties and happy hours planned for this year are a far cry from the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81c363aa-a4b2-11e5-97e1-a754d5d9538c\"> extravagant</a> bank parties before the 2008 financial crisis which featured celebrity appearances, models dressed as angels and Michelin-starred meals. </p> <p>Last week, a group of bankers in Morgan Stanley's markets division organised a party for analysts at Catch, a restaurant on Manhattan's west side. Dozens of people attended, according to one person familiar with the matter. </p> <p>On Tuesday, another Morgan Stanley division rented out a bar in Manhattan's financial district for its festivities. Less than half the team showed up, so there was a surfeit of free food and alcohol for staff who came. “It was a bit awkward,” said one partygoer. </p> <p>Celebrations will take place as usual for some financial groups. SkyBridge Capital, a fund of hedge funds run by former Donald Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci, planned a party on Wednesday night at Cipriani South Street, a downtown New York banquet hall. As of Wednesday afternoon the party was still on, according to an email from the event organisers. </p> <p>Though many bankers said they were looking forward to the parties, they said they had grown accustomed to last-minute cancellations nearly two years into the pandemic. </p> <p>A dinner for roughly a dozen fixed-income traders at a bulge bracket bank is planned for Friday, but that is likely to be called off as well, according to one of the traders who has been regularly working from the office since last summer.</p> <p>“I would love to celebrate a successful year with the people I spent the majority of my time with, but that's not the case again this year,” the trader said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Owen Walker in London and Madison Darbyshire in New York</em></p><p>Source: Imani Moise and Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Goldman Sachs orders New York bankers to cancel parties' FT.com 16 December.
