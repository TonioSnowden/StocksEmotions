  "title": "Criminal  Records Bill  Considered  ---  Legislation would  remove records for  some crimes after  sentences are done  ----  By Ben Chapman",
  "text": "<p>   Some New York lawmakers, businesses and labor unions have put their support behind a bill to automatically expunge the records of people convicted of crimes. </p><p>   The Clean Slate Act, which is sponsored by state senator Zellnor Myrie, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn, would remove publicly available criminal records for most felonies and misdemeanor crimes after people have completed the terms of their punishments. </p><p>   According to Mr. Myrie, the law would ease the challenge of finding a job, enrolling in college or leasing an apartment for those who have finished their sentences. There are more than 2.3 million people in New York state with criminal records, according to state officials. </p><p>   The proposed law is currently being considered in the state legislature, and Mr. Myrie said he is hopeful it will be voted on this year. It has the backing of many Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans, he said. </p><p>   \"Not only is this the morally right thing to do,\" said Mr. Myrie. \"It makes economic sense.\" </p><p>   The bill has the support of some labor unions and corporations such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which sent officials to testify at a May 6 hearing on the bill. A spokesman for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said the governor would review the legislation. </p><p>   Heather Higginbottom, who is president of the JPMorgan Chase policy center, said the company hires job candidates with criminal convictions both to support communities and ensure a diverse and effective workforce. </p><p>   Around 10% of 2,100 new hires made by the company in 2020 had criminal records, she said in an interview. </p><p>   \"There are so many barriers to employment for people with criminal backgrounds,\" Ms. Higginbottom said. \"But often it results in some of the most loyal and dedicated workers.\" </p><p>   State Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt, a Republican who represents parts of upstate New York, said many lawmakers in his party don't support the bill. </p><p>   Mr. Ortt said the legislation would pose a serious threat to public safety. \"This bill would make it impossible to know the backgrounds of even violent criminals,\" he said. </p><p>   Sirena Sharpe, 30 years old, an accounting clerk from Syracuse, N.Y., said she struggled to find a job because of a 2008 drug conviction at age 17. She sent out 73 applications before landing a post in 2010 as a cashier in a gas station after she was released from prison, she said. </p><p>   Ms. Sharpe said she is fearful that the record of her conviction will prevent her from achieving her dream of becoming an accountant, even though she has paid her debt to society and no longer engages in illegal behavior. </p><p>   \"For me, having a clean slate is an actual chance at redemption,\" Ms. Sharpe said. </p><p></p>",
