  "text": "<p><em>Note: City Bulletin is taking a short break. The next update will be June 14.</em></p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> has named Alexion's Aradhana Sarin as its new chief financial officer in a management reshuffle to plan around its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7444fd3-0044-4aab-ab23-60eb7a6572e5\">$39bn acquisition</a> of the US biotechnology company.</p> <p>The drugmaker said that current CFO Marc Dunoyer will step down later this year having held the role for over seven years, and will take a new senior executive role at the group. The changes are conditional upon AstraZeneca finalising its purchase of Alexion, likely in the third quarter.</p> <p>Sarin joined Alexion in November 2017, having previously worked in investment banking for Citigroup, UBS and JPMorgan.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Frontier Developments</strong> revealed it is developing a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMW1Rzf0Vrg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">new video game</a> for release next year in partnership with Games Workshop: <em>Warhammer 40,000®: Chaos Gate — Daemonhunters. </em></p> <p>Music rights fund <strong>Hipgnosis</strong> said it has bought the songbook of producer and musician Joel Little, who has collaborated with artists including Lorde and Taylor Swift.</p> <p><strong>Chapel Down</strong>, the English winemaker, launched an equity fundraising for up to £6.9m backed by biggest shareholder Michael Spencer. The company, which posted a pre-tax loss of £7.9m for 2020, said it will use the cash to scale up winery operations and fund international expansion.</p> <p>Power generation group <strong>ContourGlobal</strong>&#xa0;said it has agreed to buy Italy-based solar farm operator Green Hunter&#xa0;for €49.7m, which will increase its total installed capacity in the country by about 24 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Tungsten</strong>, the financial management software maker, said in a trading update for its year ended April that demand continues to recover following the initial impact of Covid-19 on transaction volumes.&#xa0;It noted strong momentum in new sales and recovering transaction volumes towards the end of the period, which continued into May.</p> <p><strong>Atrisinal Spirits</strong>, owner of The Scotch Malt Whisky Society, will start trading on Aim today after raising £15m of new capital and £11m for existing shareholders. Upon admission the retailer will have a market value of £78m.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>MyHealthChecked</strong>, the consumer home testing healthcare company, posted a £3.7m annual loss on revenues of £49,480.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> has appointed an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ce9a64c-8279-4791-ba07-052f86ec0c6a\">indigenous Australian</a> to its board for the first time as the mining group grapples with the fallout from the destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site last year. The Anglo-Australian company said Ben Wyatt, a former Treasurer for the Western Australia state government and a cousin of the country's Minister for Indigenous Affairs, would bring public policy, regulatory and trade experience when he joined the board on September 1. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Some of the biggest Japanese sponsors of the <strong>Tokyo Olympics</strong> want organisers to postpone the Games for several months to allow more spectators to attend. The proposal was made privately over recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fff1d4cd-1fb3-43b0-8bc8-6c1f57c02578\">according to people with knowledge of the situation</a>. Sponsors were told by the Japan Olympic Committee in April that the pivotal decision on whether to allow spectators to watch events live would not be made until the last possible moment, possibly June 24.</p> <p>The hedge fund billionaire <strong>Bill Ackman</strong> is nearing a deal with <strong>Universal Music Group</strong> that would see his blank-cheque company acquire a 10 per cent stake in the record label behind artists such as Lady Gaga and Cyndi Lauper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ca220cd-d516-4ad7-a73c-748f6de025d2\">said people briefed on the matter</a>.&#xa0;The deal with Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, a special purpose acquisition company that broke records with its $4bn listing last year, will value Universal at about $40bn.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Tiger Management</strong> founder Julian Robertson has thrown his weight behind big US technology stocks, dismissing concerns that the sector has become too frothy after investors piled in at the height of the coronavirus crisis. The 88-year-old fund manager, who is considered to be a titan of the hedge fund world, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2783e24-db12-49e0-9cfc-9cdb7badf4ee\">told the Financial Times</a> he was betting on stocks such as Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson</strong> <br>This year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0bce654c-74bd-47eb-aed4-4c9a8e065467\">annual meeting season</a> has seen protests over executive pay, facial recognition technology and lobbying. But no subject has attracted more militancy than companies' contributions to climate change. Executives should spend more time listening to fringe voices for they can often be the harbingers of tomorrow's consensus.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Investors and companies are lining up to throw money at the prime minister's promised “broadband revolution”. The money <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8defa807-6424-41f0-86e2-3dc43a70b099\">flooding into fibre</a> should, to borrow an awful government phrase, help get the UK “gigafit for the future”. It's not yet clear the same is true of BT though.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'AstraZeneca appoints new finance director' FT.com 4 June.
