  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Banks in China Get Political Advisory",
  "text": "<p>The move reflects the sensitivity of regulators and Chinese government officials in the run-up to China's 20th National Congress in Beijing, which will kick off on Oct. 16. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is expected to extend his rule for a third term at the meeting.</p><p>The CSRC's message has been disseminated internally by some banks. This past week, research strategists at JPMorgan's private banking arm in Asia were told in an internal conference call not to comment on politically sensitive subjects for now, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The CSRC, in response to a query from The Wall Street Journal, said: \"The content of your inquiry is not true, please do not spread it.\"</p><p>Recent research notes from JPMorgan's private bank have analyzed topics including a recent U.S.-China audit agreement and challenges facing China's slumping housing market. One looked at whether a mortgage revolt in China could snowball into the country's \"Lehman moment\" -- a reference to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the financial-market pandemonium it unleashed. That report concluded that such an outcome was unlikely in China.</p>",
