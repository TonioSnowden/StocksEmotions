  "text": "<p>Switzerland's attempts at shedding its long-held reputation as the global banking centre of choice for oligarchs, corrupt government officials and drug smugglers has been dealt a blow by the leak of documents detailing the accounts of 30,000 Credit Suisse clients.</p> <p>The cache of documents — some dating back decades — was reported by a consortium of media outlets and brought further embarrassment to Switzerland's second-biggest lender, which has spent the past two years lurching from one scandal to the next.</p> <p>But the fallout threatens to spread throughout the Swiss finance sector, with shares among the country's banks falling further than most European lenders on Monday, a day when equity markets were hit as tension mounted on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4bf6296-eb4d-4a26-9d46-e252b92b9837\">Russia-Ukraine border</a>.</p> <p>In response to the leak, the European People's party, the largest political group in the European parliament, called on the European Commission to consider placing Switzerland on its list of “high-risk money-laundering” countries.</p> <p>Yet Swiss banks have already spent the past decade signing up to global standards to restrict tax avoidance and money laundering, while also closing the accounts of profitable though dubious clients following pressure from international regulators.</p> <p>“The Swiss keep their mouths shut — that's ingrained in their society and their mentality — but bank secrecy effectively has been destroyed,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ffdd264-88f5-11de-b50f-00144feabdc0\">Bradley Birkenfeld</a>, a whistleblower who leaked documents detailing UBS's involvement in US tax evasion to regulators in 2007, told the Financial Times. </p> <p>As the country's tight grip on banking secrecy loosens, Switzerland's biggest lenders, including Credit Suisse, UBS and Julius Baer, are having to ask themselves what they offer clients aside from a cloud of confidentiality.</p> <p>Switzerland's obsession with bank secrecy dates back to the 18th century, when Catholic French kings used Genevan banks to avoid France's Protestant banking system. </p> <p>It became enshrined in Swiss legislation with the 1934 Banking Law, which was designed to limit mounting controversy over the country's involvement in tax evasion but also included a provision to help protect German Jewish assets from the Nazi party.</p> <p>This commitment to clandestine banking attracted despots and tax evaders throughout the 20th century — and has more recently attracted the ire of tax authorities around the world.</p> <p>But Birkenfeld — whose leaks led to UBS paying a $780mn fine after reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice — says Swiss banks have made huge strides towards adhering to international standards over the past decade. </p> <p>Birkenfeld was also jailed for his role in helping a client evade taxes but received a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d815942-fc22-11e1-ac0f-00144feabdc0\">$104mn settlement</a> from the Internal Revenue Service as part of its whistleblower programme.</p> <p>In 2017, Switzerland signed up to the international automatic exchange of information standard, which requires Swiss financial institutions to share information on their clients with the countries where they are tax resident. More than 100 countries are signed up to the same standard, which has all but killed off Switzerland's allure for tax evaders.</p> <p>“If you were a doctor or lawyer in France or Germany and you did some extra work for cash at the weekends, Swiss banks were an attractive place to hide your savings tax free,” said an executive who has worked at Credit Suisse and UBS. “But those days are long gone now: there is no tax benefit to having a Swiss bank account.” </p> <p>Yet as competition heats up, with international peers such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Bank of America also intent on looking after the assets of the world's ultra-rich, Swiss banks are being hamstrung by past indiscretions. </p> <p>Sunday's leak, known as <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/\">Suisse Secrets</a>, revealed Credit Suisse maintained the accounts of clients long after they had been arrested for crimes including human trafficking and ordering murder, as well as several individuals accused of bribery and corruption.</p> <p>Among the named Credit Suisse clients were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e55a3a18-90dd-11e4-914a-00144feabdc0\">Ronald Li Fook</a>, the former chair of the Hong Kong stock exchange who opened an account at the bank a decade after being imprisoned for taking bribes.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1144855.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The syndicate of media outlets, which included Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Guardian and the New York Times, also reported that late Egyptian president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2adf6bc-57ef-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20\">Hosni Mubarak</a>'s sons, Alaa and Gamal, held accounts at Credit Suisse for more than two decades. The pair were jailed following the Arab spring for embezzlement and corruption.</p> <p>The leak also included details of an account held by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1633129-2dc4-428e-96fa-5d52fd714a00\">Nursultan Nazarbayev</a>, the former president of Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Credit Suisse said 90 per cent of the accounts involved in the leak were closed or in the process of being closed. </p> <p>“Of the remaining active accounts, we are comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control-related steps were taken in line with our current framework,” the bank added. “We will continue to analyse the matters and take additional steps if necessary.”</p> <p>The leak comes at the same time that Credit Suisse is the subject of a landmark trial in Switzerland's Federal Criminal Court centred on the bank's dealings with a group of Bulgarian mafiosi.</p> <p>This month the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c268d9a5-5d0b-4512-8dfa-5b8ea0de15cb\">court heard</a> that more than half a dozen senior Credit Suisse managers, as well as its legal department, were aware that a group of clients comprised potentially of violent drug-smuggling criminals, yet it still approved millions of euros in transactions for them before freezing their accounts. </p> <p>Other lenders are also still being hurt by past wrongdoing. UBS is contesting the ruling in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cf322b9-7c11-479e-8d2a-4120b5926d05\">French tax case</a> that found the bank guilty in 2019 of helping rich clients evade paying tax. </p> <p>Julius Baer has suffered from its involvement in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/433250ca-53bc-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\">case</a> involving Fifa, world football's governing body, and a separate case of corruption involving Petróleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil and natural gas group. As a result, the bank was banned by the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the Swiss regulator, from carrying out large transactions two years ago.</p> <p>The Swiss Banking Association, the industry lobby group, said its members had spent heavily on compliance measures in recent years to avoid further scandals.</p> <p>“The Swiss financial centre has no interest in money of dubious origin. It attaches the greatest importance to the maintenance of its reputation and integrity,” the group said.</p> <p>Analysts say Swiss banks are suffering a loss of revenue from no longer being able to offer a haven for tax-free cash and from having to close down accounts of risky or dubious clients.</p> <p>“They are no longer hoovering up assets and are having to spend more time approving clients and making sure they are ‘legit',” said Tom Hallett at KBW. “That has definitely hurt them.” </p> <p>“For Credit Suisse,” said Anke Reingen at RBC capital markets, “even if the allegations are unfounded, this raises questions about its business practices in wealth management and should tie up management having to spend time fighting fires instead of moving forward.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Stephen Morris</em></p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26bad650-bbf6-4971-b9e4-f200b624d6d8\"><em>Germany's ‘sabotage' law and Swiss bank secrecy</em></a><em>&#xa0;/</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26bad650-bbf6-4971-b9e4-f200b624d6d8\"><em>From Stephen D Barber, London W2, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Owen Walker, European Banking Correspondent 2022 'Swiss banks' struggles to move on from murky past hit by documents leak' FT.com 22 February.
