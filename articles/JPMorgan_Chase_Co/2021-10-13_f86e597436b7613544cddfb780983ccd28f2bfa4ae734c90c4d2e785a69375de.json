  "title": "Stocks Waver Amid Inflation Data, Major Earnings; BlackRock shares rise after revenue and profit beat expectations",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, or about 175 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4%.</p><p>The consumer-price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in September, a faster pace than in the previous month, and at a 5.4% annual rate. Economists had projected a 0.3% increase from August and a 5.3% annual rate, as labor shortages and supply-chain snarls kept prices high.</p><p>\"The Federal Reserve will be very sensitive to this number,\" Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Insurance Asset Management, said. \"The message the Fed might deliver on the back of an unwelcome CPI number is an indication that the normalization process will move ahead at a faster pace than previously expected.\"</p><p>Stocks have been weighed down by fears about inflation in recent days, stoked by rising energy prices and continued supply bottlenecks. Investors are trying to gauge the effect this could have on central bank support for the economy and whether the higher costs for raw materials and energy will erode profits as third-quarter earnings season kicks off.</p><p>\"Equity markets need to incorporate the higher uncertainty on central banks' approaches and the uncertainties on the earnings side,\" said Mr. Cavarero. \"This doesn't mean the tide has turned, but some higher caution is probably the way to go for the next few weeks.\"</p><p>Fed official Raphael Bostic said Tuesday that there was a risk of inflation being more persistent than expected and that he was on board with an imminent pullback in some stimulus measures. The Fed is expected to publish minutes from its last meeting at 2 p.m., providing investors with more insight into policy makers' views.</p><p>Several household-name companies reported earnings early Wednesday. BlackRock shares rose 3.2% after the company reported revenue and profit that beat analysts' expectations. JPMorgan's earnings per share came in slightly above Wall Street's projections, but its shares fell 2.5%.</p><p>Delta Air Lines shares dropped 4.4% after the company posted a quarterly profit but said it faced pressure from rising fuel prices.</p><p>\"Have we passed the point of the sweet spot—low costs and explosive demand, to a point where demand is softening and costs are picking up? We do expect to see some signs of that starting to emerge,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. \"I do believe we'll be in a more rocky patch for equities, where they will be moving sideways or possibly down a little bit.\"</p><p>The oil-price rally halted following a report that suggested Iran nuclear talks could recommence as soon as this week, prompting some traders to price in a potential higher supply of crude to the market. Global benchmark Brent crude edged down 1.1% to $82.53.</p><p>Tempered demand due to the sharp rise in energy prices may also be contributing to the stabilization, according Mr. Mackay.</p><p>\"We are probably entering the stage where prices have moved up so quickly that we are now getting a demand response, people are reining in spending and that starts to balance the market a little bit,\" he said.</p><p>More stable oil prices will weigh on market participants' expectations for inflation, at least in the short term, according to Michael Hewson, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note dropped to 1.554% Wednesday, from 1.579% Tuesday.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%. In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4% while Japan's Nikkei 225 slid 0.3%. Markets in Hong Kong were closed due to a typhoon.</p><p>—Karen Langley contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Waver Amid Inflation Data, Major Earnings</p>",
