  "text": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4c5d29b-51c2-4e8c-b87a-ad6cac924476\">price of iron ore</a> hit a record high on Monday in the latest sign of booming commodity markets, which have gone into overdrive in recent weeks as large economies recover from the pandemic.</p> <p>The steelmaking ingredient, an important source of income for the mining industry, rose 8.5 per cent to a record high of almost $230 a tonne fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b3aed47-c049-41c6-ad87-0cfaabf6a7b3\">strong demand from China </a>where mills have cranked up production. </p> <p>Other commodities also rose sharply, including copper, which hit a record high of $10,747 a tonne before paring gains. The increases are part of a broad surge in the cost of raw materials that has lasted more than a year and which is fanning talk of another supercycle — a prolonged period where prices remain significantly above their long term trend. </p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/202dada4-b188-4112-9689-6fec2924efb0\"> price of timber</a> has also hit a record high as US sawmills struggle to keep pace with demand in the run-up to peak homebuilding season in the summer.</p> <p>“Commodity&#xa0;demand signals are firing on all cylinders amid a synchronised recovery across the world's economic powerhouses,” said Bart Melek, head of&#xa0;commodity&#xa0;strategy at TD Securities.</p> <p>Strong demand from China, the world's biggest consumer of commodities, international spending on post-pandemic recovery programmes, supply disruptions and big bets on the green energy transition explain the surge in commodity prices.</p> <p>Commodities have also been boosted by a weaker US dollar and moves by investors to stock up on assets that can act as a hedge against inflation.</p> <p>The S&amp;P GSCI spot index, which tracks price movements for 24 raw materials, is up 26 per cent this year.</p> <p>Strong investor demand pushed commodity assets held by fund managers to a new record of $648bn in April, according to Citigroup. All sectors saw monthly gains with agriculture and precious metals leading the way, the bank said.</p> <p>Agricultural commodities have had an especially strong run owing to rising Chinese demand and concerns of a drought in Brazil. Dryness in the US, where planting for this year is under way, is also adding to the upward rise in prices. Corn, which is trading at $7.60 a bushel and soyabeans at $16.22, are at levels not seen since 2013.</p> <p>“From a macro economic environment to strong demand and production concerns, the ingredients are all there for the supercycle,” said Dave Whitcomb of commodity specialist Peak Trading Research.</p> <p>Rising copper and iron ore prices are a boon for big miners, which are on course to record earnings that will surpass records set during the China-driven commodity boom of the early 2000s. </p> <p>JPMorgan reckons Rio Tinto and BHP will be the largest corporate dividend payers in Europe this year, paying out almost $40bn to shareholders. Shares in Rio, the world's biggest iron ore producer, hit a record high above £67 on Monday.</p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has crept back up<br>towards $70 a barrel, which it surpassed in March for the first time in<br>more than a year, recovering ground lost as the pandemic<br>slashed demand for crude and roiled markets.<br><br>Supply cuts by leading oil producers have helped to bolster the market<br>as consumption has begun to recover around the world.<br><br>While some Wall Street banks have hailed the start of a new supercycle, with some traders talking of a return to $100 a barrel oil, others are less convinced. The International Energy Agency said oil supplies still remain plentiful meaning any talk of a supercycle is premature.<br></p><p>Source: Neil Hume, Emiko Terazono and Anjli Raval 2021 'Iron ore hits record high as   commodities continue to boom ' FT.com 10 May.
