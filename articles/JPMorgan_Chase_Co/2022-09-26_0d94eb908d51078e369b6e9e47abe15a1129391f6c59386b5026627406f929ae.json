  "title": "Casino Shares Gain on Hopes of Renewed Tourism in Macau; Shares in Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts climb after the gambling hub's government said it would begin allowing tourists from mainland China",
  "text": "<p>Shares of U.S. casino operators have swung wildly over the last couple of years following updates to Macau's Covid-containment policies, a sign of how some U.S.-based gambling companies rely on operations in the former Portuguese colony. In 2019, Macau supplied nearly 70% of revenue for Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Wynn Resorts Ltd.</p><p>Macau, which has a population of about 650,000, has maintained strict containment measures throughout the pandemic. At one point, quarantine for travelers from what it deemed very high-risk countries was as long as 28 days.</p><p>Casino operators in Macau were hit with another complication earlier this month, when an affiliate of Genting Group, headed by a Malaysian billionaire, submitted an unexpected last-minute bid for one of the six 10-year casino licenses up for grabs.</p><p>The bid by the Genting-linked GMM Ltd. has shaken up competition for existing license-holders, including Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International, which had been expected by analysts to receive renewals.</p><p>Las Vegas Sands, which owns several properties in Macau through its subsidiary Sands China Ltd., rose 12% Monday. Monday's gains reversed the stock's losses for the year, and shares are now up about 5% in 2022.</p><p>Shares of Wynn Resorts also rose about 12%. The stock was the best performer in the S&amp;P 500 during morning trading. Shares are down around 20% in 2022, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's decline of over 22% over that same period.</p><p>Hong Kong-based Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Ltd., which operates casinos and hotels in Macau and the Philippines, got a lift, too, with Nasdaq-listed American depositary shares rising 25%.</p><p>Shares of MGM Resorts International, which relies more on its U.S. properties for revenue, rose 1.3%. MGM shares are down 32% so far this year.</p><p>JPMorgan said Macau's latest Covid-19 announcement was the most significant easing since Macau's border with China reopened two years ago. The move should \"alleviate friction for a Macau trip, as well as signal to many that it's OK to visit Macau,\" JPMorgan analyst D.S. Kim said in a research report.</p><p>Mr. Kim said the lack of electronic visas has been the \"most common pushback we heard,\" and noted that group tours used to account for about 25% of Chinese visitors to the city before the pandemic.</p><p>\"Now that Macau has a clear road map to recovery, this neglected sector should recapture investors' attention,\" Citigroup analysts said. They added that this shows Beijing fully supports Macau's economic recovery.</p><p>Both Citigroup and JPMorgan have a bullish stance on the sector. Citi's top picks are Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd., while JPMorgan's top pick is Sands China.</p><p>Some other analysts are more cautious. The gambling hub's \"pace of recovery [is] still uncertain,\" Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee said in a research note. Meanwhile, \"quarantine fears continue to deter overseas travel given China's rapid lockdowns strategy during new local infection cases,\" Mr. Lee added.</p><p>Jefferies projected that gambling revenue in 2022 will only be 14% of prepandemic levels, with revenue improving further to 46% of prepandemic levels in 2023.</p><p>â€”Clarence Leong contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Casino Shares Gain on Hopes of Renewed Tourism in Macau</p>",
