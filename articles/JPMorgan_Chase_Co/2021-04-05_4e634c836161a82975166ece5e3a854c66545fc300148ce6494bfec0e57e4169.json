  "text": "<p>(WSJ April 6, 2021)</p><p>(END)</p><p>-- My wife and I are in our early 50s. We hope to retire in about a dozen years, and we are trying to figure out if our nest egg is on track. How large should our savings be at our age?</p><p>This question gives me the chance to address one of the biggest mistakes people make in preparing for retirement: failing to get a comprehensive financial checkup long before they actually retire.</p><p>The answer to your specific question is relatively straightforward. A number of financial firms and individuals have rules of thumb and/or equations to help people calculate how much to have in savings at various ages.</p><p>Fidelity Investments has a set of \"milestones\" to track progress. (At fidelity.com, search for: How much do I need to retire.) T. Rowe Price has \"savings benchmarks\" (troweprice.com/personal-investing, search for: are my retirement savings on track), and a new J.P. Morgan report has \"retirement savings checkpoints\" on page 14 (search for: J.P. Morgan 2021 Guide to Retirement).</p><p>To be more specific, and to use your situation: Fidelity says workers should aim to save at least six times their annual income by age 50; T. Rowe Price and J.P. Morgan put the figure for a 50-year-old, depending on household income, at about five times annual earnings.</p><p>Yes, these ballpark figures can be helpful. But they address only one part of planning for later life. Ideally, you want to find out: Are my finances as a whole heading in the right direction? Put another way, you don't want to reach the year 2033 -- assuming you do, in fact, retire in 12 years -- and discover that in the early 2020s you could have or should have:</p><p>Been more aggressive or conservative with your asset allocation. Or taken advantage of catch-up provisions in your 401(k). Or opened a health savings account. Or converted a traditional IRA to a Roth. Or taken steps to pay off your mortgage faster. Or saved more money when your earnings were at their highest. Or taken a closer look at possibly exorbitant investment fees. Or rebalanced your nest egg annually. Or purchased some type of long-term-care insurance. Or done a better job of diversifying your holdings to help reduce taxes in retirement.</p><p>And yes, this means -- if you haven't done so already -- finding and building a relationship with a good financial adviser who can take the long view and help you tackle these issues and others.</p><p>I'll conclude with a sobering thought: Fully 50% of all households in the U.S. are at risk of not having enough to maintain their living standards in retirement, says the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Again, a comprehensive financial checkup at least 10 to 15 years before retiring can help put you in the better half of that mix.</p><p>-- I have a traditional IRA at Vanguard with four funds (three index and one money market) and a Thrift Savings Plan from my federal employment, also with four funds. When I make my required minimum distribution, which will be in 2022, how do I determine the amounts to withdraw from each fund? Must the RMD be withdrawn proportionally from all funds?</p><p>Let's start with the general rule: A required withdrawal for one type of retirement account can never be taken from a different type of retirement account, says Ed Slott, an IRA expert in Rockville Centre, N.Y. For example, you can't satisfy an RMD from an IRA by withdrawing funds from a 401(k). Yes, there are exceptions to this rule. They involve IRAs and 403(b)s, which are savings accounts designed primarily for educators, employees of nonprofits and ministers. Let's say you have three different IRAs; you can calculate the RMD based on the balance of all the IRAs -- and then take the RMD from any one or combination of the IRAs, Mr. Slott says. The same is true for 403(b)s. Of course, as noted above, you can't satisfy the RMD for an IRA by withdrawing from a 403(b) or vice versa.</p><p>And this exception doesn't apply to other retirement plans, like 401(k)s. If you have three different 401(k)s that are subject to RMDs, you must take the RMD from each 401(k) individually.</p><p>Now, to return to your question. RMDs can be taken from any investments within the same retirement account or \"container,\" Mr. Slott says. Your IRA is one container, and the Thrift Savings Plan is another. And, as you noted, each container holds different types of investments. The required withdrawal for your IRA is calculated based on the balance of all the investments in that container, and the RMD can be withdrawn from any one fund, or a combination of funds, within that container. The same is true for the Thrift Savings Plan container.</p><p>A final note: RMDs for 2022 will be based on the value of your accounts on Dec. 31, 2021, as well as your age on your birthday in 2022. Your calculation will be based on a life-expectancy table from the IRS. That said, unlike RMDs in earlier years, required withdrawals in 2022 will be based on new life-expectancy tables, issued in late 2020. These tables should be widely available by the time you make your withdrawals.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.
