  "text": "<p>John Dabbs and Ryan Nelson have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4668678b-37a9-4e82-9a0d-7246955ddca9\">stepped down</a> as bosses of prime services at Credit Suisse following the Archegos debacle. That bald statement has complex context. Revenues from cash equity trading are in decline, belied by last year's surging pandemic trading. Banks have fallen back on prime broking, a suite of services for hedge funds. This is a dangerous game for second tier participants like the Swiss bank.</p> <p>Credit Suisse lost $4.7bn on Archegos, a US hedge fund client whose big, leveraged bets on shares went badly wrong. It was left “holding the bag” alongside Nomura as one banker put it. Market leader Morgan Stanley took losses close to $1bn. </p> <p>This reflected the capacity as well as the agility of American market leaders. JPMorgan analysts have estimated the two US investment banks were front runners in prime broking in 2019 with $4.1bn and $3bn in prime broking revenues. Credit Suisse pulled in just $700m.</p> <p>What exactly is prime broking? Services to hedge funds include: lending money or stock; creating complex derivatives-based bets; and building low-profile positions in companies. A common theme is that clients get higher exposure to target stocks more cheaply than via a cash purchase. </p> <p>Prime brokers are supposed to hedge their own risks as counter parties. Their failure to do so was illustrated by Archegos. Losses at BNP Paribas triggered by dividend cancellations reflect similar risks. </p> <p>Coalition data suggest that revenues from prime broking at the top 12 banks outstripped those of both cash equities and equity derivatives in 2012. The trend accelerated for a few years, until prime broking suffered a sharp decline in 2019.</p> <p>The question for bankers is whether stronger hedge fund returns in 2020 will prove to have reversed or merely delayed the decline in prime broking. </p> <p>If the prime broking pie goes on shrinking, with top tier banks hogging most of it, second-tier competitors will have to withdraw. The alternative is to take on bigger risks on behalf of less reliable clients. That is a self-defeating strategy for banks and individual bankers, as Dabbs and Nelson's fate illustrates.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
