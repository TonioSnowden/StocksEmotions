  "title": "Hamilton Lane Backs Fintech Company Tifin; JP Morgan, Morningstar and others join in the $47 million Series C funding round",
  "text": "<p>The round is the third closed by Boulder, Colo.-based Tifin in the past 12 months and follows a $22.3 million Series B round announced in April. JP Morgan, Morningstar and Broadridge also invested in the Series B round. Tifin has now raised a total of about $100 million, said Vinay Nair, founder and chief executive.</p><p>Founded in 2018, Tifin uses artificial-intelligence technology to match individual investors with investment advisers and asset managers. The company works with about 50 asset managers and is used by about 1,500 investment advisers and 2 million individual investors, Mr. Nair said.</p><p>\"What we're doing is two sides of the same coin,\" Mr. Nair said, noting Tifin uses technology to understand what investments fit for individual users while matching them with appropriate advisers or asset managers.</p><p>Tifin has three divisions: Magnifi, an investment search tool with an online brokerage; Financial Answers, a data service that links individual investors with advisers and asset managers; and Tifin WealthTech, which offers users personalized financial information.</p><p>With alternative-assets manager Hamilton Lane on board as a backer, Tifin will look into adding alternative assets and alternatives managers into the range of personalized recommendations it offers, Mr. Nair said.</p><p>In recent years, managers of alternative assets such as private equity, hedge funds and real estate have sought to raise more capital from individual investors to complement money raised from institutions such as pension funds and endowments. Hamilton Lane, which led Tifin's Series C funding round, early this year launched the Hamilton Lane Private Assets Fund, a closed-end investment fund giving individual investors access to a portfolio of multiple private markets strategies for much lower minimum investments than traditional private market funds.</p><p>Tifin will use proceeds from its Series C round to invest in organic growth and likely in acquisitions in addition to expanding into private markets, Mr. Nair said, noting that financial media and workflow automation are areas the company may consider for further acquisitions.</p><p>Write to Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com</p>",
