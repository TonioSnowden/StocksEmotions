  "title": "Fink, Dimon and Musk have the blues. And one forecaster says they're not gloomy enough; Critical information for the U.S. trading day",
  "text": "<p>It's been a week. Comments from the world's wealthiest man's follows America's biggest banker, JPM Morgan Chase's JPM Jamie Morgan, who warned of an \"economic hurricane\" to come and now BlackRock's BLK CEO Larry Fink has told Bloomberg to expect elevated inflation for years, along with \"bouts of fear\" creating more market volatility. Note, Microsoft MSFTalso warned on Thursday.</p><p>Our call of the day says these honchos are not worried enough. A \"deep recession\" should start this quarter or early in the next, with U.S. GDP estimates tanking, but \"still too high,\" says Mike \"Mish\" Shedlock, investment advisor for SitkaPacific Capital Management.</p><p>In his Mish Talk blog, he points to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow Forecast that models for second-quarter GDP, which is currently at 1.3%, down from 1.9% on May 27. He says watch real final sales, the \"true bottom for the economy,\" which is holding at a \"very respectable 2.9%.</p><p>\"Real final sales was negative in the first quarter and I expect a repeat in the second quarter because I do not believe retail sales will hold up,\" he said, adding that disastrous car sales haven't helped.</p><p>What does all this gloom mean for invetors?</p><p>Note that despite Dimon's grim view, his top quant strategist has been an unswerving bull on the stock market. We'll end this on some hopeful noises from Putnam Investment's chief investment officer, Shep Perkins, who told clients in a note recently that he doesn't see a\"stagnant 70″ episode that led to flat markets for 10 years.</p><p>While high inflation will probably stick around, investors these days have an advantage with regards to the makeup of the stock market, said Perkins, in a note. Looking at price/earnings multiples during inflationary periods since 1900, he said earnings growth tended to hold up unless things got really bad.</p><p>And equity returns still managed to hold up:</p><p>The last point that Perkins makes is that this is not your parent's stock market.</p><p>\"For example, in the 1970s, capital-intensive, cyclical companies in industries suchas energy, materials, and industrials made up a significant portion of the index. Today, much more of the S&amp;P consists of high-quality, fast-growing companies that tend to be resilient in times of economic turbulence,\" he said.</p><p>Bigger risks for companies these days is \"technological obsolescence.\" Companies in the 1970s also were more cyclical and used more leverage. \"Today's S&amp;P leaders — higher-margin and capital-list businesses in sectors such as technology, communications and health care — are likely to fetch higher P/E multiples than the S&amp;P leaders of the past.\"</p><p>\"Based on history, if we do sustain an inflation rate of 7% or more for the next few years, equities are in for a challenge. However, in our view, it's more likely that inflation will slow as demand slows,\" said Perkins.</p><p>Read:  'A game of catch and release': Are recent stock-market rallies the beginning of a bull run</p><p>The buzz</p><p>U.S. nonfarm payrolls for May due Friday are expected to showa jobs gain of 328,000 from 428,000 in April, with average hourly earnings creeping up to 0.4% from 0.3%.
