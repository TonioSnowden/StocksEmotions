  "title": "House Approves $1.65 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill; Many House Republicans opposed measure and wanted to delay any deal until next year",
  "text": "<p>\"Yes, indeed the goose is getting fatâ€”we have a big bill here, because we had big needs for our country,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) in her last speech on the floor as party leader.</p><p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has made opposition to the package a central piece of his campaign to become the next speaker of the House, trying to win over a small but determined group of lawmakers opposed to his candidacy. He had urged Senate GOP leaders to push negotiations into next year in order to have more leverage on cutting spending, but they ignored that call, in part because of concerns over whether House Republicans would be able to reach a deal.</p><p>\"This is a monstrosity and one of the most shameful acts I've ever seen in this body,\" Mr. McCarthy said on the House floor, characterizing the bill as jammed with excessive spending and pet projects. He said American voters had fired the House Democrats in the midterms and that they should have held off on the bill until Republicans took control. \"Simply wait 11 days,\" he said.</p><p>\"After listening to that, it's clear he doesn't have the votes yet,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D., Mass.), referring to Mr. McCarthy's speaker bid.</p><p>The House will select the next speaker on Jan. 3, when Republicans are set to take over the chamber with a slim 222-212 majority, with one vacancy. Mr. McCarthy can only afford to lose a handful of votes, assuming all Democrats oppose him. Five Republicans have stated their opposition, making Mr. McCarthy's path tenuous.</p><p>The omnibus legislation includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than the White House had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. It also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion the prior year. The overall discretionary price tag works out to about $1.65 trillion, compared with $1.5 trillion the prior fiscal year.</p><p>The legislation also includes $45 billion in aid to help Ukraine fight against Russia's invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a direct appeal to Congress this week in a surprise trip to Washington.</p><p>The bill includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, as well as revisions to the U.S. retirement system. It also widens a ban on TikTok on government devices.</p><p>\"I would say that the omnibus was an appropriate metaphor for the last two years, a lot of sturm und drang, a lot of ups and downs. But the end, a great result that really helped the American people,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Thursday.</p><p>Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, cheered the increase in military spending but said the domestic boost was too large. \"The package of bills before us represents continued spending in areas that had already received large increases,\" she said, referencing previous spending bills pushed through Congress. The nondefense spending \"is just too much to gain my support.\"</p><p>Senators also added legislation to the spending bill that would apply workplace accommodations to employees who had limitations based on pregnancy or childbirth and another that expanded workplace accommodations for breast-feeding. Senators also amended the bill to allow Covid-19 funds for infrastructure projects and give Ukraine funds from previously forfeited property.</p><p>Rep. Chip Roy (R., Texas) objected to the widespread use of proxy voting on Friday, saying there was not a full quorum of lawmakers present. He said there were 226 votes cast by proxy on final passage. Because proxy voting is within the current rules of the House, the chair said a quorum was present.</p><p>Republicans have vowed to stop the practice in the next Congress. The system allows lawmakers to designate a fellow lawmaker to vote on their behalf due to concerns about Covid-19, but use of proxy voting has expanded greatly to include routine absences.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What items are you watching most closely in the omnibus spending bill? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The omnibus wrapped up two years in which Democrats' narrow control of the Senate and House yielded large partisan legislation, as well as some bipartisan deals. Democratic control of Washington will end next year when Republicans take the House majority they won in the midterm elections, and most legislating outside of must-pass bills is expected to come to a halt. The Senate remains under Democratic control.</p><p>Lawmakers passed a$1.9 trillion spending bill in March 2021 intended to address the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crises that followed. No Republicans supported the legislation, which they said was wasteful and would fuel inflation.</p><p>After months of negotiations, Congress this past summer passed a slimmed down version of Mr. Biden's long-sought Build Back Better plan. The renamed Inflation Reduction Act, which passed with only Democratic support, raises new revenue from taxes and enforcement, while spending on climate and healthcare programs, including tax credits for buying electric and hydrogen vehicles and making energy-efficient home improvements.</p><p>In other actions, Congress passed a $280 billion bipartisan bill aimed at boosting U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and competitiveness with China. Congress also enacted the largest expansion of veteran healthcare benefits in decades in a bipartisan bill dubbed the PACT Act, expanding coverage for post-9/11 veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits overseas, as well as for veterans of other eras who were exposed to radiation and the Agent Orange defoliant.</p><p>Congress passed firearms legislation, also in a bipartisan manner. The bill put into law a requirement that background checks cover the juvenile and mental-health records of gun purchasers under 21 years of age. The measure will also encourage states to enact extreme risk protection orders, also known as red-flag laws, and imposes new criminal penalties on straw purchases, or buying a gun for someone not permitted to, and gun trafficking.</p><p>The congressional term, which started in January 2021, also saw new spending on the nation's roads, clean water and broadband network through a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package passed last year that included about $550 billion above projected federal spending.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>House Approves $1.65 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill</p>",
