  "text": "<p>Yet the mood at the event was light and summery, if a bit sweaty. Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle entrepreneur, nodded approvingly during panel discussions; the longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin blew out candles on a surprise birthday cake; and executives and founders from such companies as Spanx, Supergoop, Spotify and Rent the Runway schmoozed over coffee with oat milk and Athletic Greens beverages.</p><p>At the center was Amy Griffin, an early-stage startup investor with a network that spans the worlds of fashion, politics, tech and Hollywood. Since opening her firm, G9 Ventures, in 2017, she has become a force in the business world.</p><p>Founders and competing investors credit Ms. Griffin, 46, with facilitating relationships that led to major deals, including Blackstone's near $900 million acquisition of Reese Witherspoon's media group, Hello Sunshine—the two are good friends—and the dating app Bumble's 2021 IPO. (Ms. Griffin serves on Bumble's board.) She was an early investor in Ms. Paltrow's lifestyle brand Goop, the Swiss sneaker company On Running, the women's co-working space the Wing, the supplement brand Athletic Greens and the Australian café chain Bluestone Lane. Independent of the investing-world cachet of her husband, the billionaire and hedge-fund founder John Griffin, Ms. Griffin has built her own reputation for identifying promising startups.</p><p>Priyanka Jain recalled that when G9 approached her about investing in her company, she wasn't initially sure whether to take the meeting, since she wasn't familiar with Ms. Griffin. \"To this day, it was the best decision,\" said Ms. Jain, a co-founder of Evvy, which sells at-home vaginal-microbiome test kits. \"We have a lot of big-brand VCs in our cap table, and no one does what they do.\"</p><p>Among her inner circle, Ms. Griffin is known for her use of soft power—making introductions, chasing down founders at conferences and offering mentorship.</p><p>\"Amy is more than an investor. She becomes your friend and your champion,\" said Sara Blakely, CEO of Spanx, which became a G9 portfolio company in 2021. \"For founders, that can be even more important than the money.\"</p><p>At the G9 gathering in the Hamptons, the second the firm has organized, women (and a few outlier men) listened to presentations on the infant-formula shortage and startups seeking to disrupt women's health. The venue—a large wood-paneled garage—was filled with the aroma of Diptyque Roses candles. A panel of investors from Union Square Ventures, Blackstone and JP Morgan fielded questions like whether companies should go public this year (no) and if founders will now have a hard time fundraising (yes).</p><p>\"When capital becomes more scarce, it is harder for women because the people that are writing those checks and the key decision-makers tend to be men,\" said Ann Chung, managing director and global head of consumer for Blackstone Growth.</p><p>Founders say it's also an especially difficult time for women to navigate the startup world, given the media fixation on their missteps.</p><p>\"The challenge for female founders is everything they do is in a heavier spotlight,\" Ms. Chung added. \"There's so much public scrutiny on what they're doing.\"</p><p>Jenna Lyons, the former J.Crew creative director and president, said she appreciated the opportunity to network in a room full of women. She was looking to raise funds for her faux-eyelashes startup, LoveSeen. Although G9 is not an investor, Ms. Lyons said that Ms. Griffin has backed her in other ways.</p><p>\"There's investment, which is money, and then there's investment which is time, introduction, nurturing of a friendship and bringing someone into your world,\" Ms. Lyons said. \"When you come into Amy's world, there's a tremendous load of support.\"</p><p>Ms. Griffin, whose family owns the Southern regional convenience store chain Toot'n Totum, said she grew up fascinated with consumer packaged goods. After graduating from the University of Virginia, she worked in the marketing departments for several magazines, including Sports Illustrated.</p><p>She met Mr. Griffin through a training group for the New York City Marathon, and they married in 2003. She left work to raise her four children, \"quieting a vital part of herself to become a mother,\" as her friend Jessica Seinfeld put it. During that time, she pursued philanthropy and sat on school boards. In 2014, once her kids were older, she started angel investing. Three years later, G9 was born.</p><p>\"There was a moment where I was sitting at a fundraiser thinking, 'Wait, I can put money into something, see it grow, and use my skill set and help a founder,'\" she recalled. \"And people had said to me, 'Why aren't you doing this full time? You already help people by buying their products and then sending it to everyone.'\"</p><p>Ms. Griffin said G9's funds are strictly separate from her husband's fortunes from his hedge fund, Blue Ridge Capital, which closed in 2017. G9 does not lead investment rounds but contributes smaller amounts, from tens of thousands of dollars on the low end up to several million.</p><p>\"Amy's creating an investment vehicle in her own right that has legs and doesn't need support,\" said Whitney Casey, a venture partner at L Catterton.</p><p>The firm's objective is to invest in companies \"that empower consumers to live, look and feel better,\" said Anna Doherty, Ms. Griffin's partner at G9.</p><p>Ms. Griffin said G9 is currently eyeing startups in women's health and telemedicine. She added that supporting minority women is a priority for the firm. Most of the summit attendees were white, though Ms. Doherty said that the invite list was more diverse.</p><p>While some firms have moved away from the consumer market, Ms. Doherty said G9 still sees opportunity in beauty, health and wellness. Friends say they trust Ms. Griffin's nose for startups, especially in those categories.</p><p>\"We tend to love and believe in the same kinds of companies,\" said Ms. Paltrow, who has made investments at Ms. Griffin's suggestion, including in the sleep tracker Oura. \"A vaginal microbiome? Sign me up to that,\" Ms. Paltrow added.</p><p>She's Looking for the Next Women-Led Unicorn. First Stop: A Very Chic Garage</p>",
