  "title": "Former Disney Executive Lists California Home for $12.95 Million; Santa Barbara County home is being sold by Anne Sweeney, who left Disney in 2015",
  "text": "<p>The main house spans about 5,000 square feet with mountain and ocean views, Ms. Sweeney said. She and her husband have lived primarily in Los Angeles for about 20 years, but she said they bought the Toro Canyon property in 2015 as a second home. They were drawn to the property's eco-friendly features, such as solar panels, a geothermal heating system and recycled building materials.</p><p>The property was only partially finished at the time, she said; the sellers had started the project, but decided to move away before finishing it. The couple hired interior designers Cliff Fong and Carla Smith-Braverman to help them complete the main home's interiors.</p><p>While finishing the house, Ms. Sweeney and her husband split their time between L.A. and the Toro Canyon guesthouse. About a year after they bought the property, they were able to move into the main home, where they have lived part time for roughly five years.</p><p>In addition to the house, the property has a swimming pool, a pool cabana, and a court for PÃ©tanque, a French game similar to bocce. There are organic vegetable gardens, avocado and citrus orchards, and native plantings such agave and cactuses. With some help, Ms. Sweeney said, she gardens and maintains the property's orchards, selling most of the produce to local restaurants and farmers markets.</p><p>The inspiration for the home's interior, Mr. Fong said, came from the personalities of Ms. Sweeney and her husband as well as the home's natural surroundings.</p><p>\"A lot of the interior finishes are basically based on color that you might see in nature,\" Mr. Fong said.</p><p>Ms. Sweeney said they have enjoyed the Toro Canyon property because it serves as an escape from the hustle and bustle of a big city. She said she and her husband often stargaze while lounging in the pool. \"It's just the most beautiful thing to see on Earth,\" she said.</p><p>The couple has decided to sell because they have bought another second home closer to the beach in Montecito. The new home is better suited to their family, said Ms. Sweeney, who has two children and a grandchild.</p><p>Ms. Sweeney spent around 19 years with the Walt Disney Company, leaving in 2015. At the time she was the only female leading a major operating unit at Disney, and was considered one of the most powerful women in the entertainment industry, The Wall Street Journal reported. Today, she she said, she serves on boards including Netflix, Lego, and the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>Nancy Kogevinas and Kathleen Winter of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties have the listing.</p><p>\"Montecito was one of the affluent, luxury communities that really took off with the pandemic,\" Ms. Kogevinas said.</p><p>Former Disney Executive Lists California Home for $12.95 Million</p>",
