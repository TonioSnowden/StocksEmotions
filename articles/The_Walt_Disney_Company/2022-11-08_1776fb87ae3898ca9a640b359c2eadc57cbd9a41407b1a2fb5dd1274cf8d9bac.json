  "title": "Disney's Earnings Hurt by Costs at Disney+; Flagship streaming service added 12.1 million new members, more than analysts expected, while parks division sets a new record",
  "text": "<p>Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek has indicated that Disney+ is entering a new phase that gives priority to income over rapid growth, but so far the company has struggled to translate subscriber additions into profits. Disney's streaming segment lost $1.47 billion in the fourth quarter, a loss of more than twice that of the year-earlier period and 38% wider than what analysts polled by FactSet had predicted. Since Disney+ launched three years ago, Disney's streaming segment has lost more than $8 billion. Mr. Chapek on Tuesday hinted at cost cuts in the near future and said his outlook for the streaming service remains rosy. He said that \"realigning (Disney's) costs,\" as well as price increases to some Disney+ packages and a new ad-supported subscription tier for Disney+ that will both take effect Dec. 8 will allow the service to achieve its goal of profitability by September 2024. \"The rapid growth of Disney+ in just three years since launch is a direct result of our strategic decision to invest heavily in creating incredible content and rolling out the service internationally, and we expect our DTC operating losses to narrow going forward,\" Mr. Chapek said in a statement. \"Disney+ will still achieve profitability in fiscal 2024, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Disney?
