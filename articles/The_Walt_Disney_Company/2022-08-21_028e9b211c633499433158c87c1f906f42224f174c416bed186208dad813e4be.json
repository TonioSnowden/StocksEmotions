  "title": "Inside 'House of the Dragon' and the Reign of George R.R. Martin; The 'Game of Thrones' creator pushed for the spinoff, which HBO hopes will breathe fire into its first interconnected franchise",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Martin, whose fantasy books established a mythology on par with J.R.R. Tolkien's, is reasserting control of his material in the TV realm. Though he had a close hand in the formative seasons of \"Game of Thrones,\" people involved in the show said he grew frustrated by a lack of involvement in its final stretch. That's when the plot of HBO's eight-season adaptation passed the events published in his books, and headed toward a 2019 finale that left many viewers feeling as burned as Daenerys Targaryen's victims in King's Landing.</p><p>\"I had no contribution to the later seasons except, you know, inventing the world, the story and all the characters,\" Mr. Martin said. \"I believe I have more influence now than I did on the original show.\"</p><p>Among the five potential series HBO initially considered for spinoffs, Mr. Martin pushed most for \"House of the Dragon,\" producers said. Premiering Sunday, it is set two centuries before the \"Game of Thrones\" saga, amid a looming war for the Iron Throne among members of the House Targaryen dynasty and their dragons.</p><p>Mr. Martin handpicked an ally to write the series: executive producer Ryan Condal, who learned his craft by analyzing the author's books, and sought Mr. Martin's sign-off before sending script drafts to HBO. The author entered a deal with HBO last year that was bigger than others he had before, he said. The five-year contract, worth a reported eight figures, solidified Mr. Martin's role as an arbiter in the network's ongoing quest to bring still more \"Thrones\" to the screen.</p><p>\"In terms of doing it right and making sure [successor shows] feel authentic to 'Game of Thrones,' you can't do better than the person who invented the world,\" said Casey Bloys, chief content officer of HBO and HBO Max. Both HBO and Mr. Martin declined to confirm financial terms of their partnership.</p><p>For Mr. Martin, legacy is at stake. For HBO, at a high-pressure moment in a corporate saga, it's an opportunity to get more from a monster hit. For much of the last decade, \"Game of Thrones\" dominated pop culture. The show introduced epic fantasy spectacle (for grown-ups) to television, plus epic production budgets, setting a standard for the many fantasy series that would follow, including Amazon's coming Tolkien adaptation \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\"</p><p>Along with colossal battles and flying dragons, \"Game of Thrones\" was known for its richly drawn characters and low-key humor. More than 19 million viewers watched the show's 2019 finale, HBO's biggest audience ever. When the HBO marketing department deployed tattoo artists at fan events, people lined up to get permanently inked with \"Thrones\" iconography. People named their babies after Daenerys (aka Dany), a descendent of the ruling family featured in \"House of the Dragon.\"</p><p>HBO needs to attract past fans and new viewers in a much-changed media landscape. Since \"Thrones\" ended, the streaming platform HBO Max launched, and HBO changed hands from AT&amp;T to Discovery Inc. Reorganization and cost cutting at the newly formed and debt-ladenWarner Bros. Discovery has resulted in cancellations and layoffs at the company. But \"House of the Dragon\" is a priority—a flagship network's entry into the prevailing Hollywood business model around \"universes\" of interconnected content.</p><p>\"The entire company is pitching in\" to launch the new series, Mr. Bloys said. Which is why, for example, the show's final trailer had its TV premiere on Discovery's Shark Week.</p><p>House of George R.R. Martin</p><p>The role of Mr. Martin, 73, demonstrates the clout that some creators with major followings can have in the intellectual-property race. He went from cult genre hero to celebrity with the success of the TV series. But the bearded author who sports fisherman caps and suspenders maintains a folksy brand, posting dispatches to fans on an old-fashioned blog from his home base in Santa Fe, N.M. His high-profile involvement in the franchise-building signals to fans that HBO is serious about hewing to the source material. It spans five thick novels and counting (plus various novellas and supplements).</p><p>Mr. Martin had backed \"Game of Thrones\" producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss in their vision for a TV adaptation. The author participated in casting choices, advised on plot arcs and wrote a handful of episodes. But his input decreased as the show's writers went beyond the material in his books, and the author focused on the sixth (and overdue) installment in his novel series, \"The Winds of Winter.\"</p><p>The search for a \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff started in 2016 after the sixth season, when Messrs. Benioff and Weiss decided to close out the series, citing their plan to end it before the show passed its prime. HBO urged the showrunners to keep the blockbuster series rolling, but eventually agreed to finish with eight seasons. Mr. Martin, too, had fought the producers' decision. \"I was saying it needs to be 10 seasons at least and maybe 12, 13. I lost that one,\" he said.</p><p>With Messrs. Benioff and Weiss opting out, HBO developed five potential spinoff concepts derived from Mr. Martin's books. The writers hired for these competing scripts each visited Mr. Martin in Santa Fe to discuss their ideas. \"It was like we were in the NFL playoffs and I'm coaching all the teams,\" he recalls. \"Emotionally, that was a little odd.\"</p><p>One concept made it to the pilot stage. Mr. Martin had some concerns about it—the setting was an ancient era only briefly described in the author's writings—but he supported the project, he said. One episode, starring Naomi Watts, was shot at a reported cost of roughly $30 million. HBO shelved it.</p><p>\"We're not going to do something just to fill a franchise plan. We're going to do shows we're excited by and proud of,\" Mr. Bloys said of the trial-and-error nature of development.</p><p>When the author pitched the concept that became \"House of the Dragon\" to Mr. Condal, \"it all clicked into place,\" the 43-year-old producer said. He was obsessed with Mr. Martin's books in his 20s, and taught himself to write by dissecting the author's techniques, he said. After he met Mr. Martin in 2013 as a fan, they bonded over their love of sci-fi and fantasy.</p><p>\"That all set me up to be kind of an archetypal candidate for this project,\" Mr. Condal said, \"because I know his world inside and out and I had spent so much time under the hood figuring out how it worked.\"</p><p>Mr. Condal had produced one TV show, \"Colony,\" a dystopian sci-fi series that ran for three seasons on USA. To help shape \"House of the Dragon,\" he recruited a friend, Miguel Sapochnik. The veteran \"Game of Thrones\" producer had directed legendary episodes, including 2016's \"Battle of the Bastards,\" with a title sequence that required 25 days to shoot with 500 extras, 65 stunt actors and 70 horses.</p><p>Mr. Sapochnik had vowed never to return to the world of \"Thrones.\" The punishing demands of the job took a toll on his personal life and health and gave him a sleep disorder, he said.</p><p>Mr. Martin helped change the director's mind over lunch at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills with Mr. Condal. When George R.R. Martin asks you to return to his world, Mr. Sapochnik reasoned, \"you have to do it.\" He became a showrunner with Mr. Condal on \"House of the Dragon,\" which HBO ordered to series in 2019.</p><p>Building a House with Many Dragons</p><p>\"House of the Dragon\" is derived from Mr. Martin's 2018 book \"Fire &amp; Blood,\" which is different from the main novels in his series. It's an epoch-spanning history of the Targaryens, as recounted by various scribes.</p><p>That chronicle format gave \"House of the Dragon\" writers a detailed plot blueprint but with leeway to invent scenes and dialogue. Mr. Condal conferred with Mr. Martin during a year of script development, including some time spent at a secret cabin in Colorado where the author was working on his next novel. Mr. Condal, who had promised him an \"exceedingly faithful adaptation,\" got Mr. Martin's go-ahead before sharing drafts with HBO. \"My feeling was, if George is happy, that is the huge first hurdle, and that everything should be judged from then on,\" he said.</p><p>\"House of the Dragon\" was made to be accessible to brand-new viewers while supplying \"Thrones\" fans with more of what they loved. The first episode features succession drama, sibling rivalry, gnarly combat, a brothel scene and dragon fire. While the original series had three dragons, the spinoff will involve 17.</p><p>\"The franchise needed to reassert itself as 'Game of Thrones,' but with a three-degree change in perspective that was aware of the zeitgeist and what the times are,\" Mr. Sapochnik said. A pivotal storyline: Whether a female will ascend to the Iron Throne for the first time.</p><p>How the show lands could influence the fate of other projects still in development, such as a potential sequel about fan favorite character Jon Snow. \"How many shows will make it to air? I don't know, but I hope the answer will be several,\" Mr. Martin said, \"and we'll have something akin to the Marvel or Star Wars model by the time it's all settled.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you plan to watch \"House of the Dragon?\" Why or why not?</p><p>Inside 'House of the Dragon' and the Reign of George R.R.
