  "title": "A Wyoming Ranch With Ties to Walt Disney Asks $71 Million; About 23 miles from Yellowstone National Park, the ranch was sold by the Disney family in the 1980s",
  "text": "<p>The owner is an LLC tied to Stephen Gordon, a former manufacturing executive who bought the ranch in the 1980s, records show.</p><p>\"It's surrounded by wilderness,\" said Mr. Gordon, who said the ranch is bordered on three sides by roughly 11,000-foot-high mountain peaks. \"It's an amazingly private place.\"</p><p>The ranch was previously owned by members of Mr. Disney's family, according to Mr. Taylor, who said he represented them in the sale to the current owner. They owned the property through a company known as Retlaw Enterprises, which Mr. Disney had formed to license his name and build Disneyland, according to the book \"The Animated Man,\" by Michael Barrier. After Mr. Disney's death in 1966, Retlaw was owned by his heirs.</p><p>Now known as Diamond G Ranch, the property is located about 23 miles from Yellowstone National Park and is surrounded by national forestland. The ranch has several structures, including a lodge with five bedrooms that serves as the owner's residence, said Mr. Taylor. The main guesthouse is a log structure with an enclosed porch. There are additional guest homes, including two log cabins, as well as a roughly 1,500-square-foot manager's house with three bedrooms. The barn has storage on the first level and an office, boardroom and kitchenette upstairs. There is also a lake, and a roughly 5-mile stretch of Du Noir Creek runs through the property.</p><p>Mr. Taylor said the ranch's privacy, river access and proximity to Jackson Hole make it extremely valuable. \"If you're within a circle of Jackson, that puts you in a pretty special place,\" he said.</p><p>Last month, a roughly 110-acre ranch a few miles from Jackson Hole hit the market asking $48 million. A 233-acre ranch in the area was listed for$35 million in June.</p><p>A Wyoming Ranch With Ties to Walt Disney Asks $71 Million</p>",
