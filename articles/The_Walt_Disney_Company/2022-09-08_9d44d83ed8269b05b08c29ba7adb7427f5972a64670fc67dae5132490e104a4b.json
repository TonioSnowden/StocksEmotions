  "text": "<p>Under sweltering sun and relentless drizzle, she shook hands with royalty and ragamuffins alike while wearing snug black or white cotton gloves from British company Cornelia James, which was awarded the royal warrant of approval in 1947, when she first wore them for her honeymoon.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II, whose lifetime coincided with the rise of Disney, was as recognizable as one of its iconic characters. Born in 1926, two years before Mickey and Minnie Mouse appeared in the first \"Steamboat Willie\" cartoon, her style and silhouette were as distinctive as Minnie's, and just as universal. She was pop—which Andy Warhol knew when he painted her in a tiara for his 1985 \"Reigning Queens\" silk-screen series.</p><p>\"She recognized what an important part of her job fashion was,\" said Elizabeth Holmes, author of \"HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style.\" (Ms. Holmes formerly worked at The Wall Street Journal.) \"It was a uniform but it was exciting and delightful, which is really hard to do.\"</p><p>From her early childhood as a young princess in organza dresses, white socks and pearls (always pearls), to her time as a young queen in the wasp-waisted styles of the 1950s, to her later devotion to bold tailoring, she was the vision of feminine correctness. But no one dressed quite like the queen.</p><p>Never Without Her Handbag</p><p>The queen was very rarely photographed without her distinctive purse—almost always an old-school, structured model from Launer London. While she is said to have possessed over 200 Launers, she usually carried a simple black \"Traviata\" style, a ladylike top-handle bag that retails for around $2,750.</p><p>What did the queen need to carry around, exactly? Over the years, she was seen removing the following from her purse: lipstick and a compact; a folded bill for church collections; a crossword puzzle for down time; extra spectacles; a handkerchief. British journalist Sali Hughes, who wrote the book \"Our Rainbow Queen,\" said on a podcast that the monarch unexpectedly carried a cellphone—for texting with the grandkids.</p><p>…Nor Her Bestie/Stylist</p><p>Angela Kelly, the queen's personal dresser and assistant, was one of the monarch's closest confidants for around three decades and was completely responsible for her wardrobe in her later years. No job was too small—Ms. Kelly broke in the queen's shoes before she wore them, as described in Tina Brown's \"The Palace Papers.\" And no job was too big: She would make bespoke outfits for special occasions, such as the Chanel-like pale blue suit the queen wore on a rare London fashion-week outing, sitting front row at the Richard Quinn show alongside Anna Wintour in 2018.</p><p>Ms. Kelly wrote two books, \"Dressing the Queen\" and \"The Other Side of the Coin,\" about her almost jocular relationship with the queen, which showed unusual glimpses into the ruler's humor and private life. In 2006, when the queen was eager to see a kookaburra on a trip to Australia, Ms. Kelly pranked her with a fake one. In a similar stunt, the royal dresser pretended to have dyed her hair purple using a hairpiece on an official visit to Thailand.</p><p>The Brighter, the Better</p><p>Some women complain of becoming invisible in old age, but the queen's uniform grew bolder in her 80s and 90s. While she always favored bright colors—such as a vibrant coral silk gown in 1963 to attend an evening event in London—she turned to nearly neon hues in the 2000s. Silhouettes stayed simple (the knee-length coatdress a staple), but she chose eccentric shades like hot pink and bright yellow.</p><p>When she celebrated her 90th birthday in a neon-green coat from court favorite Stewart Parvin, the hashtag #neonat90 went viral.</p><p>The point was to be visible: When she went to an outdoor event with lots of grass, for example, she would rarely wear green. Bright colors are \"all about politeness,\" Ms. Hughes explained. \"She feels that if people have been waiting for her in the rain for eight hours behind barriers, they should at least be able to spot her when she finally arrives.\"</p><p>Iconic Gowns</p><p>Although she became more associated with her daytime, tailored looks, Queen Elizabeth also wore some of the most celebrated gowns of the 20th century, particularly in her youth.</p><p>The British designer Norman Hartnell was responsible for many of these sweeping, midcentury gowns, including her 1947 wedding dress and her 1953 coronation gown. The wedding dress, which featured seed-pearl embroidery, was made two years after the end of the war, when rationing was still in effect. The queen was allotted 200 extra ration cards to make the cream satin dress, and well-meaning commoners sent their ration cards to her, too—which were returned to them.</p><p>The Original Bling</p><p>The queen's jewelry collection—some of which she owned as monarch and some of which was part of her private collection—has been loosely valued at over £1 billion pounds. Aside from the dozens of tiaras she owned, she also wore gem-encrusted necklaces, hair combs, earrings, and often, brooches. Some speculated that she engaged in \"jewelry-box diplomacy,\" like former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, conveying messages with her pins. For example, at a 2018 meeting with then-president Donald Trump, she wore a brooch that had been given to her by former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, giving royal-watchers something to talk about.</p><p>Traditionally, members of the British royal family don't wear tiaras until they are married. In the 75 years after she married Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth wore tiaras and crowns more than perhaps any of her contemporaries. For her coronation she was crowned with the solid-gold St. Edward's Crown, which weighs nearly 5 pounds.</p><p>\"You can't look down to read the speech, you have to take the speech up,\" she said about crowns in a 2018 BBC documentary. \"If you did, your neck would break or it would fall off. So there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they're quite important things.\"</p><p>Country-Mouse Cosplay</p><p>The queen, devoted to horses, hunting and country life, always had a parallel wardrobe of country clothing. When she was at her Scottish country estate Balmoral, she was most often seen in riding jodhpurs, Barbour jackets, boots and silk headscarves. By the fire in the evening, she wore granny classics like long kilts and cardigans.</p><p>\"Her casual style gave you the truest sense of what she liked,\" said Ms. Holmes. And what she liked—loved—were her dogs, her horses and her family. Her Hermès headscarves, a rare French brand mixed into British brands and custom-tailored pieces, often featured playful prints, like canine or equestrian motifs. Dogs and horses remained her passion throughout her life. At the 2005 wedding of then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, the queen disappeared from the reception into a side room not for important state business—but to watch the Grand National, one of Britain's biggest horse races.</p><p>Royal Warrants From the OG Influencer</p><p>Royal warrants are the official stamp of approval from the royal family, and the queen issued many of them to fashion and accessories brands during her tenure. \"By appointment to Her Majesty the Queen,\" is one of the most exclusive taglines a brand can advertise. The queen's frequent bolstering of classic British brands went a long way to raising their profile globally.</p><p>In addition to her precious Cornelia James gloves, Launer handbags and Barbour jackets, some brands graced with the royal warrant include Burberry, Pringle of Scotland knitwear, Hunter boots and Cartier.</p><p>But a royal-warrant holder must not cross the Firm. When the queen's former bra fitter from lingerie company Rigby &amp; Peller, June Kenton, referenced Her Majesty in her autobiography \"Storm in a D-Cup,\" the brand's warrant was revoked in 2018—after nearly 60 years.</p><p>Write to Rory Satran at rory.satran@wsj.com</p><p>In Queen Elizabeth II's Style, Color and Conviction</p>",
