  "title": "Jimmy Butler Wants You to Enjoy His $100,000 Cup of Coffee; The Miami Heat All-Star on his training routine while living with his nearly-2-year-old daughter: \"What's changed since I've become a dad is I'm always thinking, How can I be better for my child?\"",
  "text": "<p>In the offseason, Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler wakes up at 4:30 or 5 a.m., even earlier than his baby daughter, Rylee, who turns 2 later this month. By 5:30, he's on the court with his basketball trainer until around 6:45. (Butler, who has homes in Miami and San Diego, follows the same routine whether at home or on the road.) When he gets back to the house, he showers and then it's time for coffee with the team working with him on his new business, Bigface Coffee, which officially launched October 1. Last year, Butler, 32, became famous inside the bubble the NBA created in Walt Disney World for selling $20 cups of coffee from high-end espresso machines he had shipped to him there to other players. The new line's price point is equally ambitious. Bigface's current offerings include a $500 coffee-NFT box (four coffee varietals and one nonfungible artwork) and a $100,000 rolling \"go-lab\" outfitted with high-end La Marzocco coffee machinery. Right now, Butler is trying to learn latte art, which has proven to be more challenging than he thought.</p><p>Next up is breakfast and brainstorming. Then, says Butler, \"The little devil child awakens, runs around. She breaks everything, she throws everything.\" After he takes Rylee to the park, the guys start what Butler calls the \"competing phase\" of the day, playing each other in dominoes and other contests. \"It is competing from after breakfast until the nighttime work,\" he says. \"We're talking about a lot of different [games].\" In the evening, he returns to the court at 5:30, followed by the weight room and then running and conditioning. He tries to get to sleep at a decent hour before doing it all again the next day.</p><p>After a turbulent childhood in the suburbs of Houston, Butler played basketball for Tyler Junior College in Texas before receiving a scholarship to Marquette University in Milwaukee. At Marquette, he would sometimes sleep at the practice facility in a sleeping bag so he could have more time practicing on the court. In 2011, he was selected as the 30th overall pick of the NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. After six seasons with the Bulls, he played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Philadelphia 76ers before landing with the Miami Heat in 2019. He's a five-time NBA All-Star who helped lead the Heat to the 2020 Finals in the bubble, before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. Here, he talks to WSJ. about the definition of a prank and why he wishes no one recognized him at the zoo.</p><p>What do you eat for breakfast to start the week off right?</p><p>I don't really have a crazy, strict diet. There are just some things that, okay, don't put that in your body. But I have a really great chef, chef Ali. I don't count the carbs, I don't count the calories. For a normal day of breakfast, I'd say I'd have some type of breakfast sandwich, like a croissant with an egg, some turkey bacon. I love grits, being from the South. I don't care if they're good for you, bad for you, it doesn't matter. I have some grits, some water, a cup of coffee and probably some fruit. I'll get a protein shake, too, right off the bat, [so I'm not] working out on an empty stomach.</p><p>You were famous in the bubble for selling $20 coffee. Will the price of Bigface Coffee be that steep?</p><p>[For] some people it's steep, around here it's normal. You will pay $20. It's definitely a real thing now, me and my guys really love the conversations that take place over making coffee. This latte art thing, I still don't understand it. I don't get how somebody can be that talented with pouring any type of milk into a couple shots of espresso. It's one of the most amazing things to me. I actually think they're going to add that to the Seven Wonders of the World, because when you try it, it's so difficult. I just want to master one. I don't need to put the unicorn on there, I don't need to draw a picture of you on there.</p><p>You want to make a heart.</p><p>Give me the heart, give me the tulip, give me anything that I can just say, you know what, I got this. We're sitting there competing on who can get the closest to making a heart. It comes out looking like a butt half the time.</p><p>Have you done any new pranks like the $20 coffee lately?</p><p>That's not a prank. A prank is something that eventually is going to stop. Nah, this isn't stopping.</p><p>How has becoming a dad changed your routines?</p><p>I think one of the hardest things about being a celebrity is that you can't go be a parent from time to time. I hate that I can't take my daughter to the zoo because everyone wants to talk basketball or take a photo. To my daughter, I'm just her dad, she doesn't know any different. I hate that I can't take her to the park because there are kids who are out playing basketball and [they say], \"Hey, let's go play.\" I love you kids, but I literally just want to be a dad right now. A lot of times I just try to do a lot of things with her around the house, or I'll get on my bike and put her on the back of it, stuff like that, where it can just be us.</p><p>What's changed since I've become a dad is I'm always thinking, How can I be better for my child?</p><p>You're a wine collector. How does that play into your routines? Do you usually have a glass in the evening?</p><p>I definitely do, but not right now. I'm done with the whole drinking thing until three or four weeks into training camp. Then I'll celebrate the start of a new season. Here's to year 11. Whenever I do drink wine, me and my guys do drink it—not a lot—[I think], Wow, I can't believe I'm actually drinking this bottle of wine. When I was growing up, I didn't know what wine was. Damn sure I never knew I would have a passport to be able to go see the countries the wine came from. The biggest thing around here is always being appreciative of the things that you have, being thankful for being able to share your experiences with everybody.</p><p>What's the best style advice you've received, or a style rule or trick you rely on?</p><p>The best I've ever heard is from, his name's Keith, he's one of my stylist's assistants, and he said, \"Jimmy, you can wear whatever you want to wear. Just be you when you wear it.\" I was like, Yep! Nobody tell me anything, I can wear whatever I want. [It] made Khalilah, my stylist, so mad.</p><p>I take that in all aspects of my life. I'm going to be me and encourage everyone else: Be you. Be yourself. You're the only one who knows how to do it. You can do it at a high level.</p><p>What have you been reading and watching lately?</p><p>We've been watching a lot of TV shows. If I'm being brutally honest, my daughter takes over the TV more often than not. What she'll do is, in the middle while you'll be watching TV and she wants to dance, she'll make you change the TV and put on music so she can do that. I guess it's the same type of entertainment, because it's just so funny to watch her do her thing. And you have to watch whatever she wants to watch. Spirit, the movie about the wild horse, had me researching where I can go see wild horses. They're in Oregon, Nevada, southern Arizona, Washington state. Maybe one of these days I'll be able to take her in the wild and see some horses.</p><p>What's a piece of advice or wisdom that's guided you?</p><p>I remember going through life all the time and I was always saying, \"I know I can do this, I'm going to prove this person wrong.\" And then I grew up finally and decided it's not about proving them wrong. It's about proving myself right. We get too lost and caught up in what everybody else is thinking, what everybody else is saying. Then you forget to listen to yourself and your own voice and let all that other outside noise cloud the bright spots that are already in your head. I live by that daily now: Everything that I do is not because somebody said I can do it or cannot do it. It's because I'm like, You know what? I'm going to do this. I'm going to go prove to myself that I'm going to be able to do it.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Jimmy Butler Wants You to Enjoy His $100,000 Cup of Coffee</p>",
