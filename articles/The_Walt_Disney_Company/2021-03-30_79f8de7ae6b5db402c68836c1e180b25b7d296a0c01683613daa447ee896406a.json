  "title": "U.S. News: ViacomCBS Selloff Is Latest Twist in Investors' Wild Ride",
  "text": "<p>The swings partly reflect the myriad challenges ViacomCBS had faced over that period, from having to integrate both companies to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic to readjusting its priorities to focus on streaming. The stock had risen roughly ninefold over the course of a year before last week's collapse, which came amid an avalanche of forced selling by New York-based hedge fund Archegos Capital Management and banks.</p><p>Another media company, Discovery Inc., suffered similar losses last week as part of the fund's unwinding. Both companies are cable-TV conglomerates that have bet big on streaming video.</p><p>\"Discovery was stronger heading into the pandemic because their networks have held up better in the long run,\" media analyst Michael Nathanson said in an interview. \"Discovery's networks tended to skew older and have had more durable viewing habits because of the genres they're in. Whereas Viacom's skew a lot younger and tend to see more erosion in viewership.\"</p><p>ViacomCBS declined to comment.</p><p>In the months that followed the announcement of the ViacomCBS merger, the stock fell more than 75% as concerns about the wisdom of the deal were compounded by the shutting of movie theaters and cancellation of sporting events early in the pandemic -- two large revenue drivers for the company's Paramount movie studio and CBS TV network.</p><p>By March 2020, ViacomCBS's shares had fallen by so much that National Amusements Inc., the holding company that owns a controlling stake in ViacomCBS, had to restructure its credit facilities because its ViacomCBS shares that were pledged as collateral were too low. From that low point, the stock began a steady climb. The pandemic proved to be a boon for streaming, something that ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish had pledged to make the company's priority.</p><p>As Americans hunkered down at home, ViacomCBS added additional content to its CBS All Access streaming service, putting more than 3,500 episodes of shows from networks such as Comedy Central, BET and Nickelodeon on the subscription service. The company also struck expanded distribution deals with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube TV and Walt Disney Co.-controlled Hulu + Live TV.</p>",
