  "text": "<p>“Look out that window,” Robert AM Stern tells me, gesturing across Manhattan's Park Avenue towards the Art Deco building opposite, designed by Ely Jacques Kahn. Visible from where we stand are flashes of gold, blue and red ceramic decoration some 16 floors up in a characteristically blocky, vaguely Native American style. “It looks almost like a Mondrian,” Stern says, “that interweaving of colour and form. There's a pleasure in it.”</p> <p>Pleasure? I raise my eyebrows and ready my pen; it isn't a word you hear architects use that frequently. “No, we don't use it,” Stern replies. “We're intimidated by it. Especially in the UK.” He glares at me. “Where there's this idea that architecture should be a self-flagellating medium.” He grins, wolfishly.</p> <p>If your idea of pleasure is a Robert AM Stern building in the UK, you're about to be cheered right up. The New York architect, one of the most successful designers of our age, is building a new apartment block near Hyde Park. Not a wacky-shaped skyscraper, not a parametric blockbuster, but something that looks very much like something else that might have been hanging around since about 1920.</p> <p>The building (currently a large, digger-and-crane-filled hole in the ground behind exclusive-looking hoardings) is called 1 Mayfair. Developed by John Caudwell (previously of Phones4u), it replaces a parking garage and a slightly eccentric filling station in London's billionaire nexus. It is expected to be London's most expensive ever residential building, at an eye-watering £2bn.</p> <p>It's a stone-clad, Palladian block in a neo-Georgian manner that looks a little bit Edwin Lutyens and a tad Francophile Edwardian, with perhaps a touch of Piccadilly's understated Albany. With prices set for the super-rich (though the exact figures have not been released), the designs look, perhaps surprisingly, restrained. The development includes 29 homes, apartments and town houses. </p> <p>Stern is quoted in the press release as saying: “1 Mayfair is rich in both memory and optimism — it is an inspired response to the residential needs of this new century.”</p> <p>It is, you might suggest, an argument lacking in self-awareness. Likely to be bought by foreign billionaires, it is unlikely to do anything to address any of London's considerable housing needs. On the other hand, the first part of the project to be completed — around the corner in Farm Street — was a quite handsome development of 14 key-worker apartments (designed by architects MSMR, not Stern). </p> <p>Completed as the mandated developer's contribution to social housing and public goods under Section 106, it manages a remarkable metaphor in placing the residences above a new local council street-cleaning depot, also part of the agreement.</p> <p>At 83, a little wary of Covid, and keen to begin passing the responsibilities of his practice Ramsa on to younger associates, Stern isn't in his One Park Avenue office much anymore, preferring to work from home (in one of his own projects uptown). But he comes in for my sake. I get the impression his arrival is a big deal in the office. The partners, including 1 Mayfair's other designer, Daniel Lobitz, have put on neckties. </p> <p>Sharply dressed in a navy suit and a banana yellow knitted tie to match his socks (one of his colleagues tells me it's a quirk he picked up from Fred Astaire, who used to wear his trousers short to expose yellow-sock-clad ankles, to emphasise the dance steps), Stern is sprightly, warm and witty, with only an occasional hint of New York crankiness.</p> <p>“I like historic buildings,” he says. “Look around,” again gesturing to the huge window: “All the so-called modern buildings are beginning to look hopelessly alike. It's an aesthetic of assembly-line panels.”</p> <p>The name “1 Mayfair” — which has been revealed to the FT for the first time — is a quieter counterpart to the glitzy Knightsbridge development <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2a8291d-e34e-4e90-a2db-fb90ff09d5b5\">One Hyde Park</a>. It is, nevertheless, One Expensive Block. But in its desire to slot in to the Mayfair streetscape, it is entirely characteristic of its architect.</p> <p>Stern kicked off his career in the 1960s as a Modernist, became one of the most inventive and influential of the Postmodernists and ended up a pre-Modernist designing neo-Gothic university buildings for US campuses, Art Deco skyscrapers in Manhattan and big, shingle-style beachside houses in the Hamptons. </p> <p>He is a chameleon in the same sense that architects a century ago were, willing to adapt to context, to desire, happy to design a building that will be recognised for what it does: a university that looks like Cambridge, a skyscraper that resembles a 1920s Wall Street tapering tower, a library that looks like a solid, civic monument.</p> <p>His eclectic approach has not always endeared him to the still doctrinaire world of architecture. He recalls the 1970s, when his Lang House in Washington, Connecticut, (which he memorably described as “a neo-Palladian Regency Art Deco farmhouse”) caused an early Postmodernist shock to the system. “The Lang House was a screaming announcement,” he says. “It was radical in its discussion of history.” And Stern has always discussed history.</p> <p>Despite being the dean of Yale's School of Architecture and having been a leading voice in the development of Postmodernism in the 1970s and 1980s, Stern's stylistic profligacy has stymied the star status he might have otherwise accrued. “A lot of architects don't approve of what we do here,” he says “but we get work. Clients like us! And I want the patronage of clients. We build for people,” he says. They just need to be rich, it strikes me.</p> <p>Clients like him because his work sells. Big time. In 2019, an apartment in Stern's Deco revival tower 220 Central Park South became the most expensive US home ever sold when hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin paid $238mn for the 24,000 sq ft penthouse. Sting reportedly has digs in the same building. At the super-slender 520 Park Avenue, apartments have sold for more than $60mn (former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond and entrepreneur James Dyson have both bought units there).</p> <p>More surprising, perhaps, was that an apartment at 70 Vestry Street, nowhere near Central Park but in post-industrial Tribeca, went for $56mn. Another Deco-type pile of setbacks and terraces clad in creamy stone, it sits between industry and luxury, as does Ramsa's High Line development Abington House, a red-brick mountain of a building echoing Chelsea's warehouses and factories but extruding upwards to 33 storeys. The super-rich are clearly keen on whatever it is that Stern has.</p> <p>In his early years, Stern says his greatest influences were Vincent Scully, the historian of the Shingle Style, Paul Rudolph, a renowned Brutalist, and Philip Johnson, the traitor to high Modernism who segued from glass box to Chippendale top.</p> <p>“Johnson said: ‘You cannot <em>not</em> know history,'” Stern says. “Whereas [Bauhaus founder Walter] Gropius removed all the history books from the library to somewhere dark and difficult to find.” The 1960s ethic was to forget history, to begin anew. “There was a sense,” he says of that decade, “that something had gone horribly wrong with architecture.”</p> <p>Stern sits at a big desk with a row of books behind him. Mostly they are about his own buildings but at the far end is a cluster of large-sized titles about New York. Published from 1983 onwards they trace the history of his home city's architecture. They are, I think, one of the greatest surveys of any city, following the evolution from the early skyscrapers and Beaux Arts mansions to the cultural joy of Art Deco, the minimal slabs of the mid-century, through Postmodernism and beyond.</p> <p>“Rem Koolhaas had written <em>Delirious New York</em> [1978] and there was a sense that New York was a subject worth looking at again,” says Stern. Occasionally his retro-stylings can feel a little apologetic, stripped of the bravura of their 1920s counterparts, but they have also become a good, solid background, a contrast to the shiny, glassy, corporate monsters nudging the city's increasingly anodyne skyline.</p> <p>His love for the city's buildings goes way back. In his recently published autobiography <em>Between Memory and Invention, </em>Stern writes little of his uneventful childhood in Brooklyn except that “it was a place to <em>be from</em> and <em>get out of</em>”. Despite what it has become, arguably the centre of bohemian life in the city, he is still glad he escaped. He describes the view of Manhattan from the subway as “a metropolitan Oz” and it is surely this fondness for the city, its fabric and its skyline, which has made him who he is. He is still clearly in thrall to it.</p> <p>He has, though, worked around the world, from Beijing (in traditional Chinese architecture) and Hong Kong (imperial Deco) to Mexico City (corporate modern) and Amsterdam (bricky expressionist Amsterdam school, 1920s-style). He has built in almost every conceivable manner, from witty Postmodern houses to corporate Walt Disney “humour” (such as the sorcerer's hat on top of the Disney Feature Animation Building in Burbank).</p> <p>It was the reliable traditionalist Stern who built the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and it was Stern who got the commission to build the presidential library for George W Bush, a job that raised a few giggles — until Trump made everything simultaneously more and less funny. There was a nugget of irony in Stern making the library look like something from Roosevelt's 1930s WPA programme, the progressive, nation-building effort that could not have been further from Bush's neoliberalism.</p> <p>And yet London had eluded him. “I'm an Anglophile,” he says, “and not only the architecture.” For 1 Mayfair, he has clearly been studying the neighbourhood. He did not settle on the self-effacing brick facades of the 18th century or the brasher freestyle of the brick and terracotta Edwardian but on the solid stone of the more classical, French-influenced blocks that punctuate the area. “We took what we knew and adapted it.”</p> <p>That, he says, “should be what everybody does. There are references to Lutyens but also to [John] Nash in Belgravia. I think we're saying new things but with an appropriate vocabulary. &#xa0;</p> <p>“There's an absence of intricacy in most modern architecture,” Stern says. “That's what we're addressing, here, in New York and in London. This is an architecture filled with the devices that enliven a building, that give something for the eyes to look at. Modernism was the erasure of detail. Well, we're putting it back.”</p> <p><em>Edwin Heathcote is the FT's architecture and design critic</em></p>  <h2>Five notable Stern buildings</h2> <p><strong>Wiseman House, Montauk, New York, 1967</strong></p> <p>This career-starting house announced Stern's arrival as New York's summer house architect of choice. An eccentric Modernist beach-house covered in shingles and surmounted by an odd arch, it managed to be simultaneously Proto-Postmodernist, Functionalist and Trad. A witty, striking design that foreshadowed Stern's ability to shape shift seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>Lang House, Washington, Connecticut, 1974</strong></p> <p>Perhaps not given its due in architectural history, the Lang House (1973-74) was a brilliant mash-up of Italian villa and playful Hollywood modern. Its two sides are radically different, one a little austere with random windows (very fashionable now) and PoMo mouldings, the other a 1930s poolside fantasy. Full of invention, it is rich and rewarding.</p> <p><strong>Ehrman House, Armonk, New York, 1975</strong></p> <p>Building on the motifs of the Lang House, the Ehrman House is the mature expression of Stern's chameleon Modernism. With classical pretensions mixed with pure Modernist chic, it roots a kind of Le Corbusier tribute into a solid stone base of American wealth. Minimalist grids begin to melt into wavy walls, a last gasp of white Modernism visibly shifting into a Postmodern age. </p> <p><strong>Celebration Masterplan, Orlando, Florida, 1996 onwards</strong></p> <p>What happens when Disney builds a real place? Pretty much what you'd expect. Using the lessons drawn from the success of its theme parks, Stern adapted Disney World's walkable, eclectic fantasia of small-town life into an actual settlement of 11,100 people and 4,900 acres. It evokes a Norman Rockwell world of neat houses and lawns with none of the mess of a real city. Hugely influential and a milestone in the neo-trad New Urbanism movement, it is pure, unadulterated kitsch and people love it.</p> <p><strong>15 Central Park West, New York City, 2007</strong></p> <p>A Manhattan mountain of luxury real estate, 15 Central Park West is a tribute to the prewar architecture that made the city and the skyline. With its setbacks, crown and sheer walls of limestone with traditional windows (rather than glass curtain walls), it helped swing the pendulum back to Art Deco, a rediscovery of the city's mythical zenith. It is a little clunky in places, without the finessed detail of the finest Deco, but decently designed so that it looks as if it always might have been there. It set the tone for Manhattan's new wave of trad super-luxe.</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Edwin Heathcote 2022 '1 Mayfair, Robert AM Stern's stylistic extravaganza' FT.com 21 October.
