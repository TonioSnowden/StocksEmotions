  "text": "<p>The short chapter book \"Cornbread &amp; Poppy\" begins with an Aesop-like predicament. Cornbread has spent the autumn filling his little mouse-house with delicious provisions (\"fruit preserves, grain, and cheeses\") while his best friend, Poppy, has been whizzing about on her bike enjoying herself. Come the first snow, a chill of trepidation falls over the pair. Even if Cornbread shares his food, there won't be enough to last them both the winter. The friends must risk foraging on Holler Mountain, a place of hungry owls and slippery promontories and the site of a neighbor's disappearance years before. Mr. Cordell's humorous watercolor-dappled ink drawings keep things buoyant as Cornbread and Poppy bundle up and venture off—at which point their story takes a contemporary turn. To their relief (and perhaps that of readers ages 4-8), the predator that the two mice encounter on the mountain doesn't hunt them, as he would in Aesop, but helps them.</p><p>When 11-year-old Lal Patel arrives with his family at their new home in Scotland, his spirits are as bleak as the weather. As Joan Haig relates in the adventure \"Tiger Skin Rug,\" Lal is homesick for India, and he can't muster any enthusiasm for the rambling old Scottish house full of oddments that so delights his parents and grandmother. He's especially uneasy about the musty taxidermied tiger skin that sprawls across the drawing-room floor.</p><p>So Lal gets a shock when his younger brother, Dilip, whispers in the dead cat's ear—and the rug transforms, impossibly, into a living animal. \"The tiger's eyes were deep circles of saffron yellow, amber and black,\" Lal marvels. \"When it blinked at me, my heart soared.\" The wakened creature offers the Patel boys an exchange: If they help the tiger fulfill a long-owed promise, it will help them find their way home. And so the boys and a local friend, Jenny, embark on a great journey—riding a tiger!—that will take them, and readers ages 8-11, from drizzly Scotland to hurried London to the slums and hill country of India. With its sensitivity, sincerity and touches of humor (the boys' father runs an expat website: \"The Hindu Who's Who of Who's Here\"), \"Tiger Skin Rug\" is an excellent option for both independent reading and family read-alouds.</p><p>How exhilarating must it be to swoosh across glittering expanses of open snow behind a pack of enthusiastic sled dogs? To judge from Blair Braverman's endearing nonfiction chronicle of life as a musher, the answer is: utterly. In \"Dogs on the Trail: A Year in the Life,\" a book packed with hilarious photos of Alaskan huskies in action, Ms. Braverman, with her husband, Quince Mountain, gives a brief and sparkling account of the joys, travails and rhythms of an uncommon way of life: \"Mushers live in some of the coldest, most remote places in the world. They don't have neighbors; they spend more time with dogs than with people, and they like it that way.\"</p><p>Readers will learn how Alaskan huskies are raised, trained and fed; about the uses of harnesses, booties and tuglines; and, best of all, what the different dogs on the authors' own team are like. Consider this beguiling description of Grinch, a huskie of grizzled hair, glaring eye and goofy overbite: \"Grinch is a perfect mystery,\" Ms. Braverman writes. \"He is a light that shines from nothing and into nothing. He's a collection of feelings in a dog-shaped box made of off-brand Legos.\" Readers may not start this book as dog lovers, but by the end they're likely to be converts.</p><p>Geography can be a fickle friend. Mountains that keep out invaders may inhibit trade. Rivers that irrigate fields also flood them. Wide spans of arable land are good for growing crops but all too easy for conquerors to traverse. Earth's physical landscape has shaped human history, and it continues to influence geopolitics, as Tim Marshall shows in \"Prisoners of Geography: Our World Explained in 12 Simple Maps,\" a large-form illustrated children's version of his 2016 bestseller for adults. Illustrated by Grace Easton and Jessica Smith, the book is not comprehensive, but it gives insightful and fair-minded perspective about why certain parts of the world are the way they are: how Europe's waterways, natural harbors and temperate climate fostered commercial activity; how a huge rocky escarpment hampers economic growth in Brazil; why Poland's borders have so often been overrun and redrawn. For curious children ages 7-15, \"Prisoners of Geography\" has lots to fascinate.</p><p>If you have read your children the stories of Hans Christian Andersen or the Brothers Grimm, or if you've shown them the 1940 Disney classic \"Fantasia,\" then you're bound to have seen the supple genius of the legendary Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen (1886-1957). In Nielsen's gorgeous, dreamy, dramatic pictures, human figures exude power and dignity even when dwarfed by their surroundings—whether by high stone arches, towering willows or the vast black skies of the eerie \"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence from \"Fantasia.\" Art curator Meghan Melvin offers a fine sampling of Nielsen's work in \"Kay Nielsen: An Enchanted Vision,\" which is linked to a recent show at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Handsome and absorbing, the book brings Nielsen's sublime vision to those of us who missed the exhibition.</p><p>Children's Books: Riding a Tiger, Driving a Dog Sled</p>",
