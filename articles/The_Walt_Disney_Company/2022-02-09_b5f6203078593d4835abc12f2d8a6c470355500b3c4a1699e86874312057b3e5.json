  "title": "Technology:  Indian Cricket Becomes Streaming Prize  ----  By Robbie Whelan and Benjamin Mullin",
  "text": "<p>   Some of the world's biggest media firms are preparing to do battle over a major prize in the global streaming wars: Indian cricket matches. </p><p>   The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the sport's national governing body, plans this week to formally solicit bids for the next five years of broadcast and streaming rights for the Indian Premier League, the nation's most popular cricket league. </p><p>   Walt Disney Co., Sony Pictures Networks India and Viacom18 -- a joint venture between ViacomCBS Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. -- are among companies planning to bid for the rights, said people involved in the bidding process. The monthlong auction is expected to conclude by late March, the people said. </p><p>   Cricket broadcasts are a major lure for India's sizable population of potential streaming subscribers. The auction comes as streaming companies are under pressure to add customers beyond the U.S. as growth has slowed domestically. </p><p>   Disney, which currently holds the broadcast and streaming rights, faces a potentially steep rise in the cost to retain them. The company has said the cricket matches are an important driver of international subscriptions for its Disney+ streaming service. </p><p>   For the coming auction, suitors are preparing bids of around 400 billion rupees, or more than $5 billion, according to people familiar with the bidding process. </p><p>   Indian authorities award cricket broadcasting rights every five years. </p><p>   In 2019, Disney acquired Star India, including dozens of sports and entertainment-focused TV channels and its streaming service Hotstar, which has since been rebranded Disney+ Hotstar, as part of its $71 billion deal for some of 21st Century Fox's assets. </p><p>   Disney plans to bid to retain control of the rights, according to people familiar with the company's plans. Other likely competitors include Sony Pictures Networks India, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for Sony Pictures Networks India said the company is evaluating bidding for broadcast and digital rights. </p><p></p>",
