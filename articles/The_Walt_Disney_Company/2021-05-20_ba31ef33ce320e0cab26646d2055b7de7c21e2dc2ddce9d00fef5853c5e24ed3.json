  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Travel & Entertainment:  Netflix Brings the Binge to Movies  ---  Zack Snyder's film 'Army of the Dead' comes with a prequel, a TV series and VR experience  ----  By John Jurgensen",
  "text": "<p>   \"Army of the Dead\" rolls several tried-and-true movie plots into one. A heist involving a cash-filled vault. A motley band of fighters reuniting for one big score. Lots of zombies. </p><p>   It's also the brainchild of Zack Snyder, a director with hardcore fans and a filmography featuring Superman, Batman and other major Hollywood assets. These are the components of a franchise starter kit for Netflix, which is going after movie properties that can grab viewers on a global scale and keep them coming back for more installments. The company rolled out \"Army of the Dead\" in about 600 movie theaters last week (its widest theatrical release yet) ahead of a streaming premiere Friday. But before anyone had even seen the movie, Netflix shot a prequel (\"Army of Thieves\") expected later this year, and entered production on an anime series (\"Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas\") set for next year. This summer, a virtual-reality experience will pop up in various cities, where fans can ride a simulated taco truck into zombie-infested Las Vegas on a search-and-rescue mission. </p><p>   \"People don't want to wait. They are used to series -- they want to binge it,\" Mr. Snyder says. \"Now there's so much content, you forget. 'Army of the Dead,' what's that? Oh yeah, that zombie movie from a couple years ago.\" </p><p>   \"Look, now they're doing all the 'Game of Thrones' prequels, but how many years later?\" adds Deborah Snyder, a producer of the film and its offshoots with Mr. Snyder, her husband. </p><p>   Netflix is building franchises in an effort to fix a disadvantage it has in Hollywood. Despite the company's dominance of the global streaming business, it doesn't own the kind of time-tested intellectual property that reliably spawns tentpole movies and TV series, to say nothing of merchandise and theme park attractions. That I.P. (in industry parlance) is what Marvel and \"Star Wars\" are to Disney, and \"Fast &amp; Furious\" and \"Jurassic Park\" are to Universal, and \"Game of Thrones\" and DC superheroes are to WarnerMedia. </p><p>   When it comes to the lack of legacy film franchises in its portfolio, the streaming giant says it's an underdog. \"We're four years old, not 104 years old like many of our competitors,\" says Scott Stuber, head of Netflix films, referring to his time leading the division. </p><p>   The company recently bought two sequels to director Rian Johnson's hit murder mystery \"Knives Out\" for reportedly more than $400 million. It announced a sequel to \"Enola Holmes,\" starring Millie Bobby Brown as a sleuthing sister of Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Stuber says he has scripts for sequels to \"Extraction\" (which starred Chris Hemsworth) and \"The Old Guard\" (Charlize Theron). </p><p>   \"Army of the Dead\" is based on an idea Mr. Snyder hatched after directing a 2004 remake of \"Dawn of the Dead.\" In the aftermath of a zombie outbreak, the undead have been confined to Las Vegas, which is slated for nuclear destruction. A war hero played by Dave Bautista has to run the zombie gauntlet with his team to retrieve a fortune from a casino vault. </p><p>   Jake Maida, 19, is the kind of fan Netflix is betting on -- a Zack Snyder aficionado who went to a Friday night showing at a Cinemark theater in Hazlet, N.J. \"It's just nice to have him in total control of his work,\" said Mr. Maida. </p><p>   Netflix's franchise agenda goes hand in hand with its quest to feed international subscribers homegrown content. \"Army of the Dead\" has a cliffhanger ending designed with export in mind. \"Zombies are a global thing,\" Mr. Stuber says. \"There's no reason they can't be in Bogota or Paris\" or other places where Netflix produces local-language movies and TV shows. </p><p>   Urged to consider \"Army of the Dead\" offshoots set in other countries, Mr. Snyder's team came up with one for a character in the movie named Dieter, an off-kilter safecracker played by Matthias Schweighofer. Though virtually unknown in the U.S., he is a famous actor and filmmaker in Germany. He directed and starred in \"Army of Thieves,\" which was shot around Europe over two months last fall. The prequel movie features an international cast and a story about robbers who take advantage of the financial disruption caused by America's zombie problem. </p><p>   \"I love the word 'franchise' because it sounds so cool and we don't have them in Germany,\" Mr. Schweighofer says. </p><p>   For Mr. Bautista, a former pro wrestler known as Drax in Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" films, taking the lead in \"Army of the Dead\" was part of a plan to transition away from big action franchises. \"I want to be in business with Netflix because I want to be a filmmaker, not of big epic films, smaller films,\" he says. Mr. Bautista recently joined the cast of Netflix's first \"Knives Out\" sequel. </p><p>   The Snyders draw a distinction between \"cinematic universes\" that studios derive from existing libraries of intellectual property, and their own attempt to create one from scratch with \"Army of the Dead.\" As Mrs. Snyder puts it: \"In a world where everyone is reinventing I.P. that we've seen already -- a regurgitation of a movie from 10 years ago, a TV show coming back with a new cast -- to have something original is just refreshing.\" </p><p></p>",
