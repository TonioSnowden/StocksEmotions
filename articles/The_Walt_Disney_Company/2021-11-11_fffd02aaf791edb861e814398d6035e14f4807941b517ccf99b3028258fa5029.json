  "text": "<p>The <strong>UK economic recovery</strong> strengthened in September, official <strong>GDP</strong> figures showed this morning, with growth beating expectations. </p> <p>Gross domestic profit increased at a monthly rate of 0.6 per cent in September, the Office for National Statistics said. But that followed an increase of just 0.2 per cent in August (revised down from a previous estimate of 0.4 per cent) and a 0.2 per cent decline in July when the bounce back from reopening faltered. </p> <p>In the three months to September, GDP increased by 1.3 per cent after a 5.5 per cent increase in the previous quarter, the ONS estimated. That leaves the economy still smaller than pre-pandemic — though it's not entirely clear how much smaller. </p> <p>The latest increase was led by more visits to GPs and a busy period for lawyers trying to complete house purchases ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday, according to the ONS. But those gains were partly offset by a decline in car manufacturing and sales, and business investment remains well below pre-Covid levels. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Yet another busy morning for corporate results today. </p> <p>The highest profile is probably <strong>Burberry</strong>, which reports half-year results three weeks after revealing it had recruited Versace CEO Jonathan Akeroyd as its new boss. The luxury retailer said revenues were back to pre-pandemic levels, while full price sales were 18 per cent higher. Burberry reinstated its interim dividend and restarted buybacks. Chair Gerry Murphy said the retailer was “seeing an acceleration in performance in countries less impacted by travel restrictions”. </p> <p><strong>Aviva</strong> gave an update on third-quarter trading, pointing to record inflows in savings and retirement and a “sharp” increase in bulk annuity volumes in the quarter. </p> <p>Chemicals group <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> has said it will exit its battery materials business after concluding it cannot compete with “more established large scale, low cost producers”. The business had been a key hope for JM's post-catalytic converter future, as described by our correspondents in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd82dfc5-53ff-4b35-9884-3832591a5e54\">this excellent piece from June</a>. Instead JM will focus on its other growth areas, including hydrogen technologies. Its chief executive Robert MacLeod said this morning that he would be stepping down next year, with <strong>Liam Condon</strong> from <strong>Bayer</strong> due to take over in March. </p> <p><strong>WHSmith</strong> said it is “well positioned to return to meaningful profit” in its new financial year, which started in September. It made a pre-tax loss of £116m this year after a £280m loss in 2020. Revenues at its travel outlets, which were hit hard by pandemic-era restrictions, are now at 84 per cent of October 2019 levels, WHSmith said.</p> <p>Also out today are half-year results from private equity group <strong>3i</strong>, discount retailer <strong>B&amp;M</strong> and fashion retailer <strong>Ted Baker</strong>. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> got rid of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c88eaf9f-6d56-4cb3-9fd5-22847835f73b\">nearly $5bn worth</a> of his <strong>Tesla</strong> shares in the first three days of this week. The sale, which equals about 3 per cent of his holdings in Tesla according to Reuters, follows a weekend stunt in which he asked Twitter users whether he should sell 10 per cent of his holdings. Twitter users overwhelmingly supported a sale. But at least some of the disposals were planned well before he launched the poll, Richard Waters reports.</p> <p><strong>Disney</strong> disappointed with its latest streaming user growth figures, raising concerns its service <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d8fedd1-36db-45c8-8596-dce1905ec6f7\">has stalled</a> after breakneck growth thanks to a pandemic-period launch. Shares dipped as much as 4.3 per cent in after-hours trading. </p> <p>Now we know who will be mourning the death of the conglomerate most of all: investment banks. <strong>GE</strong>, which announced plans to break itself up this week, has paid more than $7bn in <strong>investment banking fees</strong> since 2000, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa719574-b457-43fd-9c45-ae19a510c1cb\">deals team report</a>. It spent $2.3bn on M&amp;A advice alone and another $3.3bn on bond fees. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>This one's easy today, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a5fa68d-7d73-4db4-b3bb-b2bc45b1c6e4\">read my column</a>.
