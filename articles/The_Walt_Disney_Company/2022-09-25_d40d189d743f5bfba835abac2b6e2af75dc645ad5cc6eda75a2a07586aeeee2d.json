  "title": "DeSantis Re-Election Campaign Focuses on Voters in Florida Republican Base; Sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard was the latest way the governor has cheered conservatives and riled progressives",
  "text": "<p>Last week, he sent two planes ofmigrants to Martha's Vineyard, infuriating immigrant-rights groups, triggering lawsuits and garnering praise from some Republicans and conservative media outlets. Mr. DeSantis recently campaigned for conservative GOP candidates in Kansas and Pennsylvania while asserting that Florida has \"gotten redder.\" His speeches often focus on critical race theory, school policies on gender issues and liberals, who he says are \"trying to render the conservative half of the country second-class citizens.\"</p><p>\"The typical strategy is to hide from those more conservative issues,\" said Christian Ziegler, vice chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. \"He's done the complete opposite.\"</p><p>Mr. DeSantis, a fast-rising GOP star who built a national profile battling the Biden administration on Covid-19 policies and corporations such as Walt Disney Co. on cultural issues, is rewriting the re-election playbook. A decisive win in November—with support from some independents and other swing voters—could make him a formidable presidential candidate in 2024 should he decide to run. Falling short could weaken the argument made by some supporters that he is the most electable Republican on the national scene.</p><p>He enters the fall campaign stretch with significant strengths in his matchup against Democrat Charlie Crist. His political operation raised $177 million through early September—compared with $20 million for Mr. Crist—breaking the national gubernatorial fundraising record, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Registered Republicans overtook registered Democrats for the first time in Florida history last year, and as of August, the GOP had an advantage of about 270,000 voters.</p><p>Polling shows Mr. DeSantis leading Mr. Crist by an average of 6 percentage points, though the margin has shrunk a bit over the past two months, according to FiveThirtyEight. Mr. DeSantis won the governorship in 2018 by less than half a percentage point, and he is aiming this year to exceed former President Donald Trump's three-point victory margin in Florida in 2020, according to people close to the governor.</p><p>Such a result could fuel the growing rivalry with Mr. Trump, who aides say is likely to run for president again in 2024. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released earlier this week found that Florida Republican voters preferred Mr. DeSantis over Mr. Trump by 8 percentage points in a hypothetical GOP primary matchup—a reversal from a similar survey in January that found the former president leading by 7 percentage points.</p><p>Many Democrats say Mr. DeSantis is miscalculating. They say the recent migrant flights he organized—involving mostly Venezuelans fleeing an authoritarian government—rankled many voters in a state with a large immigrant population, though there have been no publicly released Florida polls of voter views of the Martha's Vineyard flights.</p><p>Nationally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday found that the practice of leaders of some states sending migrants to other states was supported by 53% of Republican voters, 22% of independents and 16% of Democrats.</p><p>In addition, Democrats say, women voters are galvanized by the Supreme Court decision in June eliminating a constitutional right to abortion.</p><p>\"He might be running the primary race for president before he runs the re-election race for governor,\" said Mitchell Berger, a longtime Democratic insider who has raised money for Mr. Crist. \"It could be a fatal mistake.\"</p><p>Mr. Crist—a former Republican governor of Florida who later became a Democrat, and who most recently represented a district in the St. Petersburg area in Congress—has called Mr. DeSantis a divisive and bullying figure. And he has highlighted pocketbook issues such as rising electric bills and the state's worsening property-insurance crisis that he says the governor is ignoring.</p><p>\"Nobody's got Floridians' back because he's so focused on 2024 and these extremist stunts that he continues to employ,\" Mr. Crist said. Mr. DeSantis's campaign didn't respond to requests for comment. A recent state GOP ad supporting the governor emphasized Mr. Crist's support for President Biden, including what the ad called the administration's \"open border policy.\"</p><p>Because the gubernatorial election in Florida takes place in a midterm year, turnout generally is significantly lower than in a presidential year (though 2018 saw the highest midterm turnout in decades). As a result, candidates often focus on mobilizing loyal voters, which Mr. DeSantis can accomplish by highlighting messages and policies that rouse conservatives, said Brad Coker, managing director at Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy.</p><p>\"Midterm elections tend to be base-driven,\" he said. \"I think part of his thinking is, 'I can get Republicans really, really excited.' \"</p><p>Mr. DeSantis's re-election pitch centers in part on his handling of the pandemic. A recent ad by the state GOP features a bartender, a mechanic, a student and others thanking him for reopening businesses and schools. He often emphasizes in public remarks that he made these decisions in the face of opposition from public-health specialists. He has built a brand around not backing down.</p><p>Florida's death rate over the course of the pandemic is 377 fatalities per 100,000 people, 13th-highest among states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its economic recovery has been faster than in many states, with an unemployment rate in August of 2.7%, 13th-lowest among states, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.</p><p>Republicans \"say great things during the campaign season,\" Mr. DeSantis said in a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in Aventura, Fla., earlier this month. \"Then the minute it gets tough…they kind of just scurry around to safety.\" He added, \"You got to be willing to stand and you got to be willing to fight.\"</p><p>While Mr. DeSantis has thrilled conservatives and riled progressives with his fights against what he calls \"woke agendas\" in schools and workplaces, he also periodically highlights issues that appeal to a broader portion of the electorate. He has promoted investments in environmental resiliency projects and used federal funding to pay bonuses to teachers and first responders.</p><p>Strategists in both parties say his recent move on the migrant flights served to divert discussion from abortion, which has proved a potent issue to rally Democrats in many states. Unlike Republican leaders in some conservative states who havepushed to ban or heavily restrict most abortions since the Supreme Court decision, Mr. DeSantis hasn't called for specific new restrictions beyond the 15-week abortion ban he signed into law earlier this year. That measure currently faces legal challenge.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What does Gov. DeSantis need to do to attract voters in the middle?

Wade,\" said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic consultant in Miami. \"It changes the battlefield for Democrats from offense on reproductive rights to defense on immigration.\"</p><p>The abortion decision has fired up Katie Hathaway, a 42-year-old Democrat in Neptune Beach who said she feels that women's lives are at stake. A mother of two schoolchildren, she said she also is disturbed by Mr. DeSantis's intervention in school board races and laws he backed that, for instance, restrict instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools.</p><p>\"I feel like it's constant culture wars,\" said Ms. Hathaway, who plans to vote for Mr. Crist. \"In the process, he's harming every Floridian based on bigotry and hate.\"</p><p>Kathleen Zalomski, a 67-year-old Republican in Fort Myers who plans to vote for Mr. DeSantis, said she supports his education policies, including another law he signed this year that bans the teaching in schools of critical race theory, which argues that the legacy of white supremacy remains embedded in modern-day society. She applauds the governor for keeping schools and businesses open during the pandemic and for sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard.</p><p>\"He sticks to his guns, and he goes after what he believes in,\" Ms. Zalomski said.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at Arian.Campo-Flores@dowjones.com and Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com</p><p>DeSantis Re-Election Campaign Focuses on Voters in Florida Republican Base</p>",
