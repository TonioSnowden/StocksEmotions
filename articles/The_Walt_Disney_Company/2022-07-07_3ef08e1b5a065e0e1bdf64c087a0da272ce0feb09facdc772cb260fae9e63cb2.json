  "text": "<p>Towards the end of last year, BuzzFeed's public listing felt more like a reckoning than a celebration.</p> <p>Upon coming to market in December — in what was seen as a test of investor appetite for digital media — BuzzFeed's share price tanked calamitously. Early employees were left furious as their equity halved in value within days, to around $5 a share. </p> <p>As it turned out, that was only the start. Its stock has now sunk to around $1.50 a share and is down 84 per cent from listing. </p> <p>A BuzzFeed optimist might blame the wider stock market sell-off. Over the past six months, the S&amp;P 500 index has dropped about 20 per cent as the US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to rein in soaring inflation. </p> <p>But in the media sector, the downturn has been nothing short of a bloodbath. </p> <p>From their respective November peaks, Netflix is down nearly 75 per cent while The New York Times has dropped 48 per cent. Disney is down 45 per cent and Warner is down around 49 per cent. Spotify has lost 60 per cent. </p> <p>Such sheer drops in valuation suggest investors have pretty deep concerns about the future of these industries — journalism, film, television and music — and the large companies that lead them.</p> <p>“Right now, investors are pretty down about the entire category”, says Rich Greenfield, analyst at LightShed. </p> <p>The odd thing is that, at least publicly, the company responses to the carnage have been fairly muted so far. These businesses have largely resisted mass lay-offs or drastic cost-cutting moves. </p> <p>Netflix has trimmed about four per cent of its workforce. Its global head of television spelt it out last month, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/netflix-business-model-no-radical-shift-bela-bajaria-1235165356/\">announcing</a>: “We are not doing some radical shift in our business”. The NYTimes currently has more than 200 jobs listed on its site. Spotify is not cutting staff but says it will slow hiring by 25 per cent. </p> <p>Warner has shelved original productions in places like the Nordics and Hungary, but is still expected to spend $22bn on content in 2022, an increase from last year. Most of the major studios still plan to spend more on programming in 2023 than 2022. </p> <p>BuzzFeed said it would only approve “critical hires”, while offering buyouts to journalists and cutting about roughly 1.7 per cent of its staff. In comparison, BuzzFeed in 2019 axed 15 per cent of its workforce, and in 2020 cut 6 per cent of its US staff. </p> <p>In effect, these groups are signalling that, in the face of a market rout, they will mostly stay the course on their strategies and growth plans, betting the music plays on. </p> <p>But can they afford to? At what point does it become a real problem that BuzzFeed's stock price is hovering dangerously close to zero? Or that Hollywood studios have <a href=\"https://variety.com/vip/top-media-tech-companies-to-spend-140-billion-on-content-in-2022-1235150688/\">earmarked </a>more than $140bn on programming this year, as the economy heads into a recession?</p> <p>Over the past month, these are the questions I've been asking executives in the industry. Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek played down his company's share price as a broader market challenge. “I don't know that the market has turned its back on Spotify specifically”, he told me last month. “I think the market has soured on pretty much everything.</p> <p>One longtime entertainment lawyer says that in recent weeks, studios he works with have cancelled shows and movies, but that it's been kept relatively quiet.</p> <p>“Austerity is in full swing right now. But you don't want consumers to read that you're not going to make the content that they're paying $15 a month for, so that one they're gonna keep quiet,” he says. “But shows are getting cancelled”. </p> <p>The reception to media stocks has been so harsh that Greenfield suggests struggling companies like BuzzFeed could retreat from the public market entirely, and take themselves private.</p> <p>What seems clear is that the excesses of the “peak TV” era are not sustainable. The post-2008 monetary and fiscal stimulus brought seemingly limitless money to Hollywood. As consumers, we had more television to watch than ever before, and we paid less money for it than ever before. </p> <p>Now, that will change. Higher interest rates make the future profits of growth stocks relatively less attractive. The Netflix model — spending heavily and sacrificing profit in the name of growth — is not as shiny any more. </p> <p>Eventually, media companies are likely to start spending less.&#xa0; “Something has to change,” says a longtime consultant to Hollywood studios. “Because if you leave it at status quo, nobody is going to make any money”. </p> <p><em>anna.nicolaou@ft.com<br></em></p><p>Source: Anna Nicolaou 2022 'Media companies grit their teeth as investors dump their stocks' FT.com 7 July.
