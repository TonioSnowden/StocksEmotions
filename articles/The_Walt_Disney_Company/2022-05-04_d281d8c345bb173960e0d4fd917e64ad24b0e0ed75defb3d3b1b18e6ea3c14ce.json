I have said that Reedy Creek may be the world's only socialist economy that actually works. The Reedy Creek Improvement District certainly is responsive to its constituents; we should all be so fortunate. That is hardly likely to be the case if governance falls to Orange County and Osceola County.</p><p>Roger Leemis</p><p>Southfield, Mich.</p><p>---</p><p>You quote Gov. Ron DeSantis saying \"I don't support special privileges in law, just because a company is powerful.\" Now please ask if Mr. DeSantis feels that same way about The Villages. My guess is that he doesn't care to look hard into the special privileges enjoyed by the group that runs The Villages as its fiefdom.</p><p>J. Brad Peebles</p><p>North Palm Beach, Fla.</p><p>---</p><p>Concerning our governor's quest to terminate Disney's favored tax status: Where is Sen. Elizabeth Warren when you need her to lecture us on corporate welfare? Oddly, she is nowhere to be found.</p><p>Paul J. Schilling</p><p>Saint Augustine, Fla.</p>",
