  "text": "<p>    In the latest episode of the Marvel television series \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" the title superheroes wing into Europe for hand-to-hand combat with a gang of chemically enhanced super soldiers. Meanwhile, back on the home front, there's a more nebulous threat looming for Falcon in the form of his personal finances. </p><p>   That conflict was set up in the first episode when Sam Wilson, aka Falcon and a member of all-star superhero squad the Avengers, got rejected for a loan. A bank official ignored Sam's freelance pay from the government, and instead zeroed in on his spotty credit and income history. Namely a period when Sam subsisted on people's goodwill toward the Avengers in lieu of a salary, and a five-year stretch when he'd vanished (along with half of Earth's population). </p><p>   As the series expands a franchise that dominated pop culture with sagas of an ultrarich tech mogul (Iron Man), an African king (Black Panther) and an interdimensional god (Thor), one of its revelations so far is that, for some heroes, the job of saving the planet in costume doesn't pay very well. </p><p>   \"The most human thing is to deal with bills and being broke. You can't humanize heroes without showing that,\" says Malcolm Spellman, an executive producer fort the series and its head writer. </p><p>   In the modern Marvel movies, the heroes' origin stories and battles with supervillains didn't leave much room to explain their paycheck situation. Now that the franchise has spilled onto Disney+, its architects are using the shows' weekly installments to unpack day-to-day details of superhero existence in the aftermath of the final \"Avengers\" movies. </p><p>   \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" follows Captain America's two best friends and the burdens they shoulder. Bucky Barnes, played by Sebastian Stan, is in therapy and struggling to atone for the suffering he caused as a brainwashed killing machine known as the Winter Soldier. </p><p>   Falcon, played by Anthony Mackie, is confronting what it means to be a Black superhero serving a country plagued by systemic racism. </p><p>   When Sam and his sister (Adepero Oduye) applied for funds to keep their family's fishing business alive in Louisiana, the scene implied that racial discrimination was the real reason the loan was denied. </p><p>   \"Sam, despite saving the Earth, cannot transcend his Blackness,\" Mr. Spellman says. The producer, formerly a writer on \"Empire,\" says he grounded this story line in research on racial bias in banking, and the financial plight of Black oystermen and fishermen on the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill of 2010. </p><p>   Mr. Spellman explains Falcon's financial situation this way: Even if there were funding available from wealthy patrons, Sam's work ethic wouldn't allow him to accept it. Instead, Sam gets paid on a work-for-hire basis. </p><p>   \"This is a dude who has contracts with the military -- advising them, testing tech for them, on occasion being assigned missions -- and that's how he makes his money,\" Mr. Spellman says. \"But if you're that person doing those contracts, and you don't own the company, you are not rich.\" </p><p>   Marvel comic books have a long history of working-class characters with money stresses, going back to Peter Parker. In the pages of The Amazing Spider-Man, he sold photos to the Daily Bugle to help keep a roof over the head of his Aunt May. </p><p>   That was key to the formula of Stan Lee and other Marvel writers. \"If you make these heroes struggle financially in an ordinary way, you've hooked the reader so they're not just waiting for the costume to come back,\" says comic book historian Alex Grand. </p><p>   With Sam's money problems, \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" is trying to do more than just answer geeky questions about what superheroes put on their W-2 forms. </p><p></p>",
