  "title": "Business News: Ex-Disney CEO Iger Invests in Gopuff, A Delivery Startup",
  "text": "<p>The company has raised $4 billion and has a $15 billion valuation, a spokesperson said.</p><p>\"I believe consumer commerce will be very different in the near future and Gopuff is building the platform to power it,\" Mr. Iger said.</p><p>Gopuff declined to disclose the size of Mr. Iger's investment.</p><p>For Mr. Iger, the investment in Gopuff is his latest venture in his post-Disney career. He took a board seat in March with Genies Inc., a startup that has raised $100 million. It offers tools for making virtual characters, clothing and accessories backed by nonfungible tokens or NFTs.Mr. Iger joined a consortium of investors earlier this month to invest in Funko Inc., a pop culture lifestyle brand. Mr. Iger is also advising the Funko board.</p><p>Mr. Iger's entry into the rapid-delivery business comes as the industry has grown increasingly crowded. Investors have poured money into companies such as Gopuff, Getir and DoorDash Inc.</p><p>But those startups face challenges as they try to balance expenses in a fast-growing industry with keeping prices low enough to attract customers. Earlier this year, Gopuff laid off 450 people, or about 3% of its staff.</p><p>Gopuff owns its inventory and warehouses, unlike Instacart, which delivers goods of other retailers. In a recent interview at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival, Rafael Ilishayev, the other co-chief executive of Gopuff, said this strategy will help steer the company's success.</p><p>\"We're first party. We took a lot of inspiration from Amazon early on,\" Mr. Ilishayev said. \"But I think for us, that's the party that wins. It's the one that is completely vertically integrated. It owns the entire consumer experience end-to-end. And we believe, kind of history has shown, that the first party player is a player that could do this profitably as well.\"</p><p>Mr. Iger was CEO of Disney from 2005 until early 2020, and continued as executive chairman after that until last year. At Disney, Mr. Iger led negotiations to acquire Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and Pixar, and integrated those brands alongside well-known legacy characters like Mickey Mouse.</p><p>Mr. Iger's experience as the boss of a major corporation will be invaluable for Gopuff, said Yakir Gola, co-chief executive of the company.</p><p>\"Gopuff is building a platform designed for the future of the consumer industry and nobody understands consumers better than Bob Iger,\" Mr. Gola said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
