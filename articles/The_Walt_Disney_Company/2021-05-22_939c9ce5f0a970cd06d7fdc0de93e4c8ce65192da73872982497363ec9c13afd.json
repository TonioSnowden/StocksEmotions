  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Bryan Lourd --- Co-chairman, Creative Artists Agency",
  "text": "<p>\"I'm trained to be the person helping,\" said Mr. Lourd, 60 years old.</p><p>As a co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's most prestigious talent-representation firm, Mr. Lourd helps shepherd the careers of Brad Pitt, Scarlett Johansson and many more actors, writers and directors. It's a job that comes with several traditions (a start in the mailroom, for one) and a credo: Everything is about the client. Their desires, their needs, their hopes and dreams -- a cocktail of demands that requires some hard-won emotional intelligence.</p><p>\"All of the dysfunction in my life made me great at this job,\" he jokes. \"I don't know anyone who came from a supernormal home or town who's great at this job.\"</p><p>It's fitting for someone who has always been interested in entertainment in its many guises. As a 17-year-old in New Iberia, La., Mr. Lourd and two friends, fortified by an eight-pack of Miller ponies, re-erected a 30-foot-tall Christmas tree that had fallen on the city hall lawn, enlisting police officers in an effort that ended in carol singing and a feel-good newspaper write-up.</p><p>Now that he's in Hollywood, here are four people he turns to for advice.</p><p>Larry Auerbach</p><p>Retired talent agent</p><p>Mr. Lourd got his start working as the assistant to Mr. Auerbach, then an agent at the William Morris agency who booked Elvis Presley's first network-television appearance.</p><p>\"He was a translator,\" Mr. Lourd said. For instance, he explained, there are these crucial definitions in Hollywood:</p><p>\"Yes\" means \"definitely.\"</p><p>\"Maybe\" means \"I'm never going to do that, but I'll just say that to get off the phone.\"</p><p>\"No\" means \"Sometimes a real no. Sometimes, 'Tell me more.'\"</p><p>Martin Lipton</p><p>Founding partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz law firm</p><p>In 1995, Mr. Lourd and his colleagues were blindsided when Michael Ovitz, a CAA co-founder, left to become president of Walt Disney Co. Mr. Lourd and four colleagues took over.</p><p>\"We had never run anything,\" said Mr. Lourd.</p><p>He started casting about for an attorney to help navigate the ownership shift, asking friends, \"Who will Mike Ovitz be afraid of?\"</p><p>Mr. Lipton became an indispensable source of guidance on logistics, taxes and the other business-related details of running a company.</p><p>\"He's still our lawyer,\" said Mr. Lourd.</p><p>Barry Diller</p><p>Chairman of IAC/InterActive Corp.</p><p>Mr. Lourd met Mr. Diller early in his career and became friends with him. Since then, they've done some business together -- Mr. Lourd serves on the IAC board -- but Mr. Diller functions more as an observe-and-absorb kind of mentor, especially when it comes to staying relevant in an industry obsessed with the newest thing.</p><p>\"He's the most active, most in-the-world person I know,\" Mr. Lourd said of the 79-year-old Mr. Diller.</p><p>From watching Mr. Diller, he has learned how to better spend his time. \"There's zero he doesn't do or want to do,\" said Mr. Lourd.</p><p>George Clooney</p><p>Actor</p><p>Mr. Lourd recently caught up with Mr. Clooney, getting updates from England on a script the actor had just finished writing. Despite his reluctance to ask others for advice, he considers Mr. Clooney -- a longstanding client -- to be a fantastic sounding board.</p><p>\"I trust his judgment completely,\" said Mr. Lourd. \"There's nothing he's not curious about.\"</p><p>Mr. Lourd says Mr. Clooney is an example of a client who picks projects that reflect both his personal interests and developments in the broader culture.</p>",
