  "text": "<p>Nihao from Hong Kong, where I have been enjoying my first two months of freedom in the territory after a nightmarish three weeks in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f156fbef-6508-4297-addf-a6e5e424c0d6\">hotel quarantine</a> over Christmas. Thanks in part to the draconian border entry policy, infection rates of Covid-19 are down to around 18 a day, which is impressive for a city almost as large as London. It means the government has been easing some restrictions in the past few weeks, allowing restaurants to stay open until 10pm. Compared with the experiences of my friends and family in the UK, life here feels relatively normal. That could all change though: there seems to be little urgency in Hong Kong's vaccine rollout.<br><br>I hope you enjoy my pick of the week's stories, plus a few from elsewhere you shouldn't miss.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/5a8d70c20bfc0e000429c348/subscribe/success\">Click here</a> if you'd like to receive Long Story Short by email every Friday.</p> <h2>1. ‘Every pore of Murdoch's body is driven by ambition'</h2> <p>When Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019 he divided the family spoils between his six children, gifting roughly $2bn to each one. Yet two years later, the question of what happens to the Murdoch media dynasty remains a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9719c27-5e95-49c3-a534-2796196c6af7\">ceaseless family struggle</a>. As the mogul turns 90 this month, this deep dive examines the succession issues that plague his empire. A battle over the family trust, which holds the shares in News Corp and Fox, looms once Murdoch relinquishes his grip. It's enough to imagine that his birthday party will look like something out of the HBO series <em>Succession. </em>According to one professor:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“For all his Republican sympathies for small government, [he] believes in corporate monarchy, that it should be handed down from one generation to the next.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>2. ‘Civil servants and ministers seemed bewitched by him'</h2> <p>Lex Greensill arrived in the UK in 2001, the 24-year-old son of a sugar cane farmer from Bundaberg in Australia. Over the next 20 years he became embedded in the British establishment, even hiring David Cameron, the former prime minister, to advise his eponymous finance firm. In 2017 he was awarded a CBE “for services to the economy”. But today, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41a1cf9e-c610-4263-88a9-39a8c2944dbc\">Greensill Capital is on the brink of collapse</a>. His lawyers have warned that its failure could trigger a wave of defaults among the companies it loaned money to and 50,000 job losses. One former financial services minister said:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“There was a failure to ask basic questions about him and how his business had so quickly become a big player.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>3. ‘Citi should retract this report immediately'</h2> <p>On Monday one of the world's top investment banks, Citi, put out a report called “BITCOIN: At the Tipping Point”, which caused quite a stir in crypto-land. It probably wishes it hadn't. Alphaville writer Jemima Kelly called it “embarrassingly bad” and “truly one of the most shocking bits of ‘research'” the FT has ever seen in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8553aba7-8beb-4b48-9287-be6a08065444\">searing (and very funny) takedown</a>. The article calls out its authors for a string of errors, crimes against charts and plain wrong statistics. One former financial services minister said:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“The problem with this horrifyingly bad report is that its ‘bitcoin could become the currency of choice for international trade' line is good for headlines.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>4.&#xa0;‘Every leader needs a fool'</h2> <p>Manfred Kets de Vries has spent his life examining narcissistic traits in company bosses. In this week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74280f82-1523-4cc4-bc3c-4c8eb12ef4b8\">Lunch with the FT</a>, columnist Michael Skapinker talks to the 78-year-old professor — over video from their respective kitchen tables in north London and Grasse, Switzerland — about his life's work and why he has decided that Donald Trump is a “malignant narcissist”. Over foie gras and sea bass, Kets de Vries also discusses the impact growing up in Nazi-occupied Holland had on his career, and why a “crazy accident” on top of a mountain that resulted in a broken spine meant he became “somewhat of a nicer person”. He says:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“Happiness is something to do, someone to love and something to hope for.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>5.&#xa0;‘Birkenstocks demonstrate that anything can become chic'</h2> <p>The FT's US financial editor Robert Armstrong, and occasional fashion writer, this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c21c300e-9780-4414-876d-d540c03a546f\">weighed into the world of shoes</a> in a column about Birkenstocks. The sandals, he argues, are like regular bowel movements: healthful and comfortable, but utterly without charm. He writes after news last month that L Catterton, a private equity fund backed by LVMH (owner of Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, among others) bought a majority stake in the shoemaker for €4bn. With wary respect, he surmises that a shoe that was designed specifically for functionality without regard to appearance came to be treasured specifically for its looks. As one fan says:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“They look casual without being try-hard. They are rough-hewn enough not to seem unmanly and they're not precious . . . I genuinely think [they're] really chic.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>Quick hits</h2> <h4>OTHER FT STORIES THAT HAVE CAUGHT MY EYE THIS WEEK</h4> <ul>  <li><p>Imagine if Jeff Bezos disappeared from public view and it was assumed that the US government had something to do with it? That is the situation in China, where <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa9ed13c-25a8-4aae-900d-58333e4cea12\">Jack Ma</a>, co-founder of Alibaba, has appeared in public only one since October last year. While the Communist party system needs entrepreneurs it curtails anyone who becomes too powerful.</p></li>  <li><p>Hong Kong has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c50ad498-c7ff-4e68-9f5f-c66ca1a62183\">dropped from the economic freedom index</a> after a continued crackdown by authorities on pro-democracy campaigners. Since moving to Hong Kong a few months ago I've seen first-hand the impact of this tension on the city, its people and its business community. This latest blow to the territory's reputation underlines growing concerns over Beijing's tightening grip on the Asian financial centre.</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, a country famed for <em>Vorsprung durch Technik</em>, engineering prowess and competence, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33f8ffd6-066b-449c-bf7e-edd51d661b19\">lost its Covid crown</a>. Its crawling vaccination programme has fallen well behind that of the UK and US, which are leading global efforts, and even Morocco is vaccinating more quickly. This piece explains what went wrong.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Poland's decision to outlaw abortion last October led thousands to take to the streets. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e652266c-81a1-41a7-bf9f-9c015a7c73bd\">protests are back this week</a>, with many citizens demanding liberalisation from the rightwing government. “I'm terrified because, for me as a woman in reproductive age, it means that getting pregnant in Poland became dangerous,” says one Polish woman.</p></li>  <li><p>This week was Budget week in the UK, when the chancellor set out his vision and spending plan to get the country out of the economic hole created by the pandemic. It's an important event in the FT calendar, and one of the most important bits of news to emerge was an intended <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bed2d00a-f4d5-4fda-b859-3d7ca2c31972\">increase in corporation tax</a> from 19 to 25 per cent in 2023 — the first such rise since 1974. The move was met with dismay by business representatives from the City of London.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <h4>WHAT I'VE BEEN READING ELSEWHERE</h4> <ol>  <li><p><strong>‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/world/asia/myanmar-protests-women.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><strong>She is a hero': In Myanmar's protests, women are on the front lines</strong></a> <br>A month after the military seized power in Myanmar, a generation of young women are among the frontline of protesters who have electrified hundreds of cities across Myanmar, sending a powerful message to the generals who ousted a female civilian leader. <em>(The New York Times)</em></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/mar/04/how-big-tech-helps-india-target-climate-activists-naomi-klein\"><strong>How Big Tech helps India target climate activists</strong></a> India has been gripped for weeks by the case of Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old climate activist, who has found herself ensnared in an Orwellian legal saga that meant she spent nine days under police interrogation accused of sedition and involvement in an international conspiracy.

But when it comes to Covid-19 deaths, some of the world's richest countries are among the worst off. This probing analysis delves into the reasons why. (<em>The New Yorker</em>)</p></li> </ol> <h2>Before you go</h2> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Hong Kong's newsstands not only sell newspapers and magazines from around the world, they also sell books that are banned in China. Historically, people would cross the border from the mainland to pick up juicy tales about the private lives of officials in the highest ranks of the Communist party. But a recent licensing decision means these artefacts of Hong Kong life are dying out. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GLLmEYaB0\">This film by Vice</a> captures their fascinating history.</p> <p>We always want to hear your thoughts and feedback, so drop me a line at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tabby_Kinder?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Tabby_Kinder</a> or email us at&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:longstoryshort@ft.com\">longstoryshort@ft.com</a>&#xa0;— and have a lovely weekend.</p> <p><strong>Tabby</strong><br><em>Asia financial correspondent</em></p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder 2021 'A selection of the FT's biggest stories and best reads every Friday' FT.com 5 March.
