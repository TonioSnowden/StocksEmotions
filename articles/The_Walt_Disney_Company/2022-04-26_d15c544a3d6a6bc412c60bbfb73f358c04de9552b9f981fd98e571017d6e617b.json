  "title": "Disney Employees Slated to Relocate to Florida Caught in Political Crossfire; Imagineers and other theme park employees required to move from California highlight America's political divide after clash over passage of Florida bill",
  "text": "<p>In July, Disney told some 2,000 members of its storied Parks division that they had to relocate from Southern California to Florida or risk losing their jobs. Employees said they were given 90 days to decide. Then, in March, members of the relocating group called on company leaders to speak out against Florida legislation limiting classroom discussion of gender and sexuality. In the weeks since, Disney has become a top political target in Florida, just as these employees consider down payments on new homes there.</p><p>The timing of the Parks relocation has placed the Disney workers in a crossfire of state lawmakers and the world's largest entertainment company. The group represents a fraction of Disney's approximately 190,000-member workforce, but the group's experience underscores the tricky terrain companies walk when they publicly engage on social issues increasingly becoming a state-by-state debate. What Disney and employees expected to be a difficult but manageable transition has become fraught and public for both sides.</p><p>Workers have had a variety of responses to relocating. Some employees have already opted to move to Florida, a Disney spokeswoman said, adding that, overall, more workers have said they would relocate than the company initially expected.</p><p>Yet displeasure with the move has prompted months of rancor that are unusual for Disney, which had traditionally been a company where disputes rarely spilled into public view and employees were reluctant to criticize leaders.</p><p>In recent weeks, the Florida fight has caused conversations with Disney executives to grow even more heated, workers say, and prompted veteran employees who had planned to move to start looking for new jobs instead.</p><p>The relocating employees have become a political symbol for governors. In mid-March, as debate over Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill flared, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a message on Twitter, \"Disney, the door is open to bring those jobs back to California—the state that actually represents the values of your workers.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, as Mr. DeSantis railed in speeches against Disney's political stance, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis joked he was offering \"full asylum\" to Mickey and Minnie Mouse in his state.</p><p>For some, the political has become personal. One veteran Parks worker, for instance, is gay and said he hopes to have a child in the coming years. He has worked for Disney in California for years, but said he wasn't comfortable moving to Florida since the new law, which critics call the \"Don't Say Gay\" law, passed in March. He said he wondered whether his child would feel comfortable discussing his family in a Florida school.</p><p>The stakes in Disney's fight with Florida over that legislation are rising. Last week, Mr. DeSantis signed into law a bill that would end a special tax district granted to Disney for more than half a century, a move widely viewed as retaliation for Disney's speaking out against the new law.</p><p>The legislation outlaws classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity through third grade. Disney's criticism of it came after internal and external pressure to speak out, given the company's outsize profile and economic heft in the state. Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek initially had avoided weighing in, warning against his company becoming a \"political football,\" only to see his distancing and subsequent turnabout make Disney into just that.</p><p>Ahead of Mr. Chapek's speaking out against the bill, about 150 Parks workers known as Imagineers sent a letter on March 1 to division leaders urging a public rebuke. Many of the elite group of designers and engineers who conceive and build theme-park rides and attractions had been slated to relocate to Florida.</p><p>No response was \"lending an invisible hand to fostering an anti-LGBTQ environment in a State…where [Disney] is planning to move additional thousands of employees in the near future,\" said the letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The jobs being relocated to Florida are lucrative to the state's coffers, with an average salary of $120,000 and a capital investment of up to $864 million by Disney. The company is expected to get an estimated $570 million in tax breaks over 20 years as part of the relocation deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Company executives also see it as a chance to centralize Parks operations further.</p><p>Beyond the Imagineers, employees in consumer products, gaming, publishing and interactive divisions have also been asked to move. The relocations are expected to start in 2023 and continue through late 2024.</p><p>Some Imagineers who decided not to move were told they could expect termination once their current project was completed. Those who initially said they would move and then later change their minds risk losing severance payouts they would otherwise receive upon leaving Disney, typically a week's pay for every year of employment, the company said. A Disney spokeswoman added that the company has been flexible with employees and their personal situations.</p><p>For some, politics has never been far from the decision of whether to go. When Parks leaders told workers of the relocation last year, some expressed anxiety over Florida politics even before the Parental Rights law entered the picture.</p><p>One Imagineer said that, upon hearing of the relocation, she recalled worrying about Covid-19 restrictions that politicians had kept looser in Florida than in California.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What impact will the vote by Florida's Legislature have on Disney? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In a more recent meeting, angry employees cited a year-old decision by Disney's Parks division to add a fifth \"key\" to the list of priorities that guide employees who work with the company's theme parks, according to employees who attended.</p><p>For decades, Disney's Four Keys described its core values: safety, courtesy, show and efficiency. Last year, Disney added an inclusion key, a reflection of how the Parks had overhauled attractions and revised wording in announcements to be more mindful of diverse audiences. The new inclusion policy includes Parks workers being allowed to work with their tattoos visible.</p><p>\"We'll never stop working to make sure that Disney is a welcoming place for all,\" wrote Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, in a blog post announcing the addition and titled \"A Place Where Everyone is Welcome.\"</p><p>Today, the inclusion key is cited routinely by employees who are calling for a pause on the relocation to Florida. A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment on the criticism.</p><p>Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Employees Slated to Relocate to Florida Caught in Political Crossfire</p>",
