  "text": "<p>Good morning. Voting is under way in two by-elections today. The first is in Wakefield, where the Conservatives are defending a slim majority against Labour in a seat they won for the first time in 2019. The second contest is in the mostly rural constituency of Tiverton and Honiton, where the Conservatives are defending a huge majority against the Liberal Democrats in a seat they have held since the dawn of time. </p> <p>My best wishes to all Inside Politics readers on the campaign trail: may the people whose doors you knock on be clothed and happy to see you. And remember: it's not the dogs you can see you need to worry about, but the ones you can't.</p> <p>I'll reflect on those two contests tomorrow. My colleagues Seb Payne and Jim Pickard have an excellent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d8b3793-7953-4f12-896e-9cb60069545a\">curtainraiser on the by-elections here</a>.

Jacob Rees-Mogg unveiled the online dashboard yesterday. </p></li> </ul> <h1>For Sir, With Love?</h1> <p>Peter Foster and Chris Giles have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edc85667-9471-4934-920d-f80a8dc83393\">a great write-up</a> of the growing disputes over public sector pay and the UK government's inflation strategy. Here's the money shot:</p> <p>You don't have to be a radical syndicalist to think that this is not an attractive pay scenario for teachers. We can say with a fairly high degree of certainty that increasing teacher quality and retaining sufficient numbers of staff will increase educational attainment. If we are not at crisis point already in UK schooling, it cannot be far off. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/136499b4-67e4-4319-9375-39f5ccb098c4\">As I said in Inside Politics yesterday</a>, one problem for the government is that its strategy on wage increases is hard to reconcile with its aims and manifesto pledges on public services.</p> <p>But that underlines the broader problem with the government's approach. Although its direct power as an employer is one lever it can pull to combat inflation, its power as an employer is <em>also </em>the lever it pulls to increase the quality and quantity of its staff. New <a href=\"https://www.nfer.ac.uk/the-impact-of-pay-and-financial-incentives-on-teacher-supply/\">analysis by the National Foundation for Education Research</a> found that the government's pay offer and incentive schemes were “unlikely to result in an adequate supply of teachers in England in 2022-2025, particularly in science, technology, engineering and maths”. The UK plainly does not have enough full-time teachers at present and this problem may well become more acute. </p> <h1>Not that hard to argue</h1> <p>The other front facing the UK government is the row over the triple lock pension, which will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edc85667-9471-4934-920d-f80a8dc83393\">go up in line with inflation</a> at exactly the moment when ministers are urging working people to show pay restraint. </p> <p>It's fair to say that ministers are not covering themselves in glory arguing for the fairness of this policy, but to be blunt this is not a particularly sticky wicket. After more than a decade of the triple lock, the state pension is still only a little over <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/what-youll-get\">£9,000 a year</a> for the luckiest state pensioners.</p> <p>Although of course many pensioners are not solely dependent on the state pension, <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/financial-lives-2020-survey-impact-coronavirus\">about a third of retired adults rely on it</a> as their main source of income. Despite the huge forward strides the UK has made in reducing pensioner poverty, 18 per cent of UK pensioners live in poverty, according to a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/uk-poverty-2022\">report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>. The various inflationary pressures facing UK households stand to increase that number. </p> <p>As far as political arguments go, defending the idea that the state pension should go up in line with inflation is not a hard one. </p> <p>I think this is worth noting. For all the Labour party enjoys a consistent lead over the Conservatives, most Westminster watchers assume the Tories will reel Labour in come election time. One reason is that, when an election campaign gets under way, we assume Boris Johnson will spring into life because he prefers running for office than being in office. His political strategist Isaac Levido will run a ruthless and effective campaign, in contrast to the frequent retreats and drift that have characterised Downing Street. </p> <p>We also assume that while Sir Keir Starmer's party has made some cute tactical choices, the absence of a clear overarching strategy will become a bigger problem in an election campaign. We think that Starmer will not enjoy the campaign trail. It isn't yet clear who will actually run the Labour campaign, or what ground the Labour leader wants to fight it on. </p> <p>But one thing we should ask ourselves is: will the Conservative campaign machine <em>really </em>find another level come election time? I am yet to speak to a Conservative MP or minister who thinks that the government is winning the air war over the strikes. That is partly because of the impressive TV performances of the RMT's general secretary, Mick Lynch. But these strikes are also a stress-test for the Tory election machine — and one that, at the moment, they are not emerging from all that well. </p> <h1>Now try this</h1> <p>One film I wish had done better at the box office is the excellent <em>Ali &amp; Ava </em>(Danny Leigh was also a fan: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd7c29be-2567-4b5e-8e4e-9c213ffdfdf7\">read his review here</a>), a movie I feel never got given a fair shake. It had a sharply limited cinematic release and it was marketed as if it were a teeth-dissolvingly twee story of Northern life. It is happily now on Netflix UK where I hope it will enjoy a highly successful afterlife as the cult classic it deserves to become. </p> <p>In more lowbrow news, I watched the final episode of <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> on Disney Plus last night. It's the best thing the franchise has done since <em>Rebels </em>came off the air, and I think worth enjoying even if you are not a completist. </p><p>Source: Stephen Bush 2022 'UK schools are nearing crisis point ' FT.com 23 June.
