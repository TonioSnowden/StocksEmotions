  "text": "<p>• Song of the year went to Silk Sonic (the duo of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak) for their '70s throwback \"Leave the Door Open.\"</p><p>The 64th annual Grammy Awards aim to return to normal on Sunday, with a first-ever ceremony in a Las Vegas arena and a full-capacity audience, one year after the pandemic necessitated a smaller, more intimate show whose natural-feeling performances garnered positive reviews.</p><p>Pop phenom Olivia Rodrigo is considered a front-runner for major awards, thanks to her breakout success last year, which included the chart-topping hit single \"drivers license\" and her debut album \"Sour.\" The Disney teen star is up for seven awards, including the four most prestigious ones—album of the year, song of the year, record of the year and best new artist. Comedian Trevor Noah, of \"The Daily Show,\" is set to host for a second straight year.</p><p>\"We're back, y'all,\" said actor LeVar Burton, of \"Star Trek\" and \"Reading Rainbow,\" who served as host for the pre-televised portion of the ceremony, where most of this year's 87 awards are handed out.</p><p>Jon Batiste, the jazz musician and bandleader of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" was among the show's big early winners, scoring four awards, including best music video and best American roots song. Mr. Batiste has the most nominations of any artist, at 11.</p><p>Sunday's ceremony marks several firsts for \"music's biggest night.\" This year, there are 10 nominees for the top four honors, up from eight last year and just five before 2019. It's a move designed to recognize a broader array of musicians and help repair the credibility of the televised show.</p><p>Also, for the first time in decades, the awards process has been entirely left to voters: Last April, the Recording Academy, which runs the Grammys, removed its controversial nominations-review committees, which for years have had final say over many nods. The undisclosed memberships of these committees had fueled concerns about voting improprieties.</p><p>Many people in the music business have applauded the move, but the risk is the Grammys will become more of a popularity contest and less distinguishable from other shows, Grammy watchers say. For example, seven of this year's 10 nominees for album of the year are among the most talked-about musicians of 2021: Ms. Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Lil Nas X, Doja Cat and Kanye West.</p><p>The Grammys have long been a lightning rod for complaints. Over the years, critics have assailed everything from the show's recognition of Black and hip-hop artists and female performers to its transparency on voting processes.</p><p>This year brought a new concern: That something could happen akin to the now-infamous \"Oscars slap.\" It couldn't be learned what extra security precautions the Grammys have put in place, if any.</p><p>As the pre-televised ceremony progressed, Mr. Burton poked fun at the Oscar-slap-related concerns, instructing the crowd to \"stay in your seats and keep your hands to yourself.\"</p><p>The Grammys, which were originally scheduled for Jan. 31 but delayed because of the pandemic, come at a period of transition for the broader music industry.</p><p>Revenues in the U.S. record business continue growing at a healthy clip, thanks to streaming, along with new sources such as TikTok, videogames and fitness apps.</p><p>The concert industry, for its part, gradually reopened last summer and fall and is now bracing for potentially record-breaking year in 2022. Yet Covid-19 remains a major concern for musicians and concert-executives alike.</p><p>Some performers are concerned about performing shows for maskless crowds, as safety rules ease. Others are canceling shows because of fresh Covid-19 infections in their touring parties. Meanwhile, the recent jump in gasoline prices, along with other costs, could hold some consumers back from spending on concert tickets just as the crucial summer season gets under way.</p><p>Other early winners on Sunday evening included Foo Fighters, which won three rock-related awards, in the wake of the death of their drummer, Taylor Hawkins.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What songs did you find most notable over the past year in pop music? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Kanye West, who recently changed his name to Ye, earned two awards, for best rap song and best melodic rap performance, giving him 24 career awards—and tying him with Jay-Z among hip-hop artists. Tyler, the Creator won best rap album for \"CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST,\" one of the most critically-acclaimed hip-hop albums of the past year. </p><p>Chris Stapleton picked up two country-related awards, and New York-based musician Arooj Aftab won for best global music performance. Joni Mitchell, in one of her recent rare public appearances, accepted an award for best historical album.</p><p>Write to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com</p><p>Grammys 2022: Silk Sonic's 'Leave the Door Open' Wins Song of the Year During Glitzy Las Vegas Show</p>",
