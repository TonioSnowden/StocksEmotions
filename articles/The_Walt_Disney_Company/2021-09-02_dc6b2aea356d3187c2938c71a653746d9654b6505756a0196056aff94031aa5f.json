  "title": "Café St Honoré, Edinburgh: ‘Self-confident execution and no holding back on flavours' — restaurant review",
  "text": "<p>My chum <a href=\"http://www.carolineeden.com/\">Caroline Eden</a> lives in Edinburgh when she's not travelling around Central Asia writing about food. If she tells you a <em>plov</em> is good in Uzbekistan, you can&#xa0;take her word for it and book the trip. So when I asked her for a recommendation in her hometown, and she said she'd loved Café St Honoré so much that she'd eaten there on the last three consecutive nights before lockdown, I felt I could trust her judgment. </p> <p>Parallel to the grand boulevard of George Street runs a little alley, cobbled and atmospheric, named Thistle Street North West Lane, which frankly sounds like the kind of place you'd go to buy a wand. There, on the corner, lies a café so quaintly French-looking that even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3be600da-4189-11e1-8c33-00144feab49a\">Raymond Blanc</a> would say <em>c'est un peu trop, hein?</em> I suspect it was once a glorious old wood-panelled boozer and they've cunningly repurposed it to look like something out of a Brassaï photograph. If I'm wrong, then Disney's finest imagineers have been in and the results are extremely convincing.</p> <p>Perhaps my favourite thing about Café St Honoré, though, is how hard it is to get a glimpse of the chef. Down at the back of the dining room, the wall has been cut away to create an open kitchen, but chef Neil Forbes has erected a screen so that customers don't have to look at him. Can we just let that sink in for a moment? The level of modesty and reticence in that. The total lack of showing off. It's so bloody Scottish. As I sat, consuming his superb cooking, I realised that most of my Desert Island chefs are Scots, people like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c36a9292-3507-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e\">Jeremy Lee</a> and the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea27bde6-ed2b-11e8-8180-9cf212677a57\">Neil Borthwick</a>, who also keep their substantial lights under the metaphorical bushel. It bodes well for the food.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Pickled Phantassie organic beetroot, Golden Cross goat's cheese, toasted hazelnuts and apple” is not a welter of innovation — in fact, it's a modern brasserie standard — but Forbes manages a fragrant and complex pickle that precisely balances the floral richness of the soft cheese.</p> <p>When the menu says “Orkney hand-dived scallops”, you usually expect a couple of identical cylinders of white muscle and a little green faffery for brightness. Here there are three, each of different size, two with coral, each richly glazed with butter and grilled to a good Maillard tan. I love this. I don't want identical molluscs, policed into soullessness on a plate, I want the three freshest buggers, however they come off the boat, cleaned, cooked and served. It's a thousand times more honest and, when paddling in a shallow pool of gorgeous roast pepper compote, wholly ravishing.</p> <p>By now a theme is beginning to emerge. The chef might be physically reticent, but the food is assertive. Self-confident execution and no holding back on flavours. This, I like a great deal.</p> <p>There's nothing new to tell you about “Grierson's organic coq au vin” — except that the bird has the authentic strength of flavour, bordering on the fowly, that makes everything else slip into place. The impossibly rich jus combines with crisped pieces of bacon and slippery little mushroom chunks. “Buttery” is a hopelessly inadequate adjective for the mash, and the local greens had a ferocious iron tang that approached collards in their robustness. I'm assuming “Grierson” is the name of the lovely rural chicken charmer who seduces the birds into volunteering to be eaten. It was such a distinguished piece of poultry, though, that Grierson may well have been the actual name of the chicken.</p> <p>In these conditions, nobody will be surprised that I chose lemon tart for dessert. By this point I was wearing a string of metaphorical onions round my neck. The filling had become intimate with the crust, robbing it of crispness, yet it was no less gorgeous for this minor technical glitch.</p> <p>OK. I think I've exhausted all my Scottish and French stereotypes, but there's something special going on at Café St Honoré, where classic canon meets restrained creativity, where self-effacing presentation meets outstanding ingredients. There! I didn't even mention the Auld Alliance once.</p> <p><em>Follow Tim on Twitter&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timhayward\"><em>@TimHayward</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email him at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=tim.hayward@ft.com\"><em>tim.hayward@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Tim Hayward 2021 'Café St Honoré, Edinburgh: ‘Self-confident execution and no holding back on flavours' — restaurant review' FT.com 2 September.
