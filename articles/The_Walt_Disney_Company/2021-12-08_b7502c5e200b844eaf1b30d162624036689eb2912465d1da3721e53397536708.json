  "text": "<p><br>As an underdog, maybe Roku had a silent presence boosting its heft in the negotiating room. On Wednesday, the video streaming company announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/youtube-stays-roku-devices-companies-strike-multi-year-deal-2021-12-08/\">reached a last-minute agreement</a> with Google's YouTube service that keeps it on Roku's platform. Roku's distribution platform wanted to drop YouTube's content, disagreeing over terms. </p> <p>The dispute had gone on for months. Members of Congress had weighed in amid concerns over Google's hegemony. Up against titans such as Google, Netflix, Apple and Disney, Roku in just a few years has suddenly become a serious challenger. But its relative size and worries about a plateau in streaming demand hints that Roku is just too pricey for investors.</p> <p>Known for its dongle that allows smart TVs to connect to the internet, hardware makes up a fraction of its top line and even less of profits. Roku really is an advertising business, earning revenues from marketers. They pay mostly to display ads on Roku's screens or on other big video-on- demand services accessed via Roku.</p> <p>It earns a decent living. Roku has 56m users each of which bring in $40 in average revenue annually. That has climbed by half in the last year. Annual sales which hit $1.1bn in 2019 should reach nearly $4bn in 2022.</p> <p>In recent quarters, both Netflix and Disney+ have recorded disappointing subscriber growth. Nobody expected Roku to reach their size of viewership. Its share price is nonetheless down 50 per cent from this year's peak, while its forward enterprise value to its ebitda ratio is high at 50 times.</p> <p>Roku says that it earns no revenue from YouTube's video service. Rather, claims Roku, the dispute is about Google demanding that Roku favour its product on the platform and allegedly making other demands of Roku not required of other carriers. On Wednesday, Roku <a href=\"https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv\">did not disclose</a> any details on how a compromise was struck. But both sides decided they needed each other. Google very probably made the additional calculation that this was not the moment for a public relations fight with an underdog.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Roku/YouTube: David's Roku takes on the Google Goliath' FT.com 8 December.
