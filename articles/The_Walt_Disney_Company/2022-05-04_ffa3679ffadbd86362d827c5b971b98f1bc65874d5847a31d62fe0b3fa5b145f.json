  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>Two of Roman Abramovich's longstanding associates — Chelsea's chair Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia — <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/342f7cc2-8a03-4e4d-a47d-ab150f7e77d2\">are set to keep their jobs</a> running the football club if the leading bidder, a consortium led by US financier Todd Boehly, prevails.</p> <h2>HSBC/Ping An: nothing personal?</h2> <p><strong>Noel Quinn</strong> has been all-in on Asia from the very beginning.</p> <p>After his predecessor <strong>John Flint</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20b20368-b79c-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c\"> was sacked</a> several years ago when the board decided his own turnround plan lacked ambition, the HSBC boss pulled off one of the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0095f40-5203-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f\"> largest overhauls</a> in the 157-year-old bank's history to expand its Asia business.</p> <p>Then, when tensions over Beijing's national security law sparked a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76f88fc4-a0c2-42dd-8419-5956477c4a4a\">quiet exodus of bankers</a> from Hong Kong, Quinn<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75b73313-9bbb-499d-8e76-8954a79fad8f\"> dug his feet in</a>.</p> <p>But despite the chief's ambitions to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38c3670c-3b0f-41e6-874e-0f9eee553744\"> pivot key operations</a> to Hong Kong and mainland China, HSBC's biggest shareholder <strong>Ping An</strong> has other plans.</p> <p>The Chinese insurer has countered Quinn's sweeping restructuring with calls for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63e7df2e-6d22-440d-b540-8c8af902a83a\">a radical shake-up</a> that would lead the bank to split its Asian and western operations.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9783704.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>A decade ago HSBC was Ping An's biggest shareholder. “Now the tables have turned,” said an adviser to the bank in Hong Kong.</p> <p>HSBC has been walking a geopolitical tightrope to maintain the support of Beijing after deploying more than $100bn of fresh capital into the region. The bank stayed put even as China's extreme pandemic restrictions sent rivals — and a portion of HSBC's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4467b39d-0e89-41d9-94b8-ac21ed78cfb7\"> wealth management client base</a> — in search of greener pastures.</p> <p>Ping An isn't the first HSBC shareholder to call for a split, but it's<a href=\"https://ft.com/content/d38fbe3d-d093-4ffa-a340-fb4b90cd342f\"> by far the most significant</a>, the FT's Tabby Kinder and Stephen Morris write. </p> <p>Since HSBC helped revive the insurer in 2012, their fortunes have reversed course. Ping An is now China's most valuable publicly listed insurance company.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1440591.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The break-up plan appears to have blindsided Quinn and HSBC's chair<strong> Mark Tucker</strong>. </p> <p>Despite the growing competition between the two companies, Tucker had drawn on his 20-year personal relationship with Ping An's founder and chair <strong>Peter Ma</strong> to foster discussions between the two groups, a person familiar with the matter told the FT.</p> <p>“It is slightly ironic that the person Tucker brought in as the key shareholder has turned on him,” the person said.</p> <p>Executives tell the FT it's more political than personal. “For a long time, the Chinese have claimed that HSBC has shifted resources overseas and had an unfair advantage as they control all of the money supply in Hong Kong,” said one banking boss. “This [break up] puts China in the driving seat.”</p> <p>Others reject that Ping An, which is not state-owned, is privy to Beijing's agenda. </p> <p>In addition to HSBC's sliding shares, the <strong>Bank of England</strong>'s move to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c13d3d21-b6f3-4449-a916-2ba4271818e4\"> halt dividends</a> early in the pandemic caused the Chinese insurer to miss out on crucial payments.</p> <h2>The curious debt-paying methods that landed Gupta in a private equity lawsuit</h2> <p>It's been more than a year since the collapse of his main lender, <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, but industrialist <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong> is still looking to refinance the core parts of his sprawling metals empire. </p> <p>While some progress has been made, French prosecutors' and the UK <strong>Serious Fraud Office</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cee5f81f-1559-4d85-9e94-e1af4df85a6a\">ongoing investigations</a> into alleged money laundering at Gupta's <strong>GFG</strong> <strong>Alliance</strong> have hindered his efforts.</p> <p>Gupta is also fighting a legal battle in London to reclaim control of Europe's largest aluminium smelter at Dunkirk in northern France. US private equity firm <strong>American Industrial Partners</strong>, which was previously a creditor to the plant, took it over last year.</p> <p>The lawsuit, however, is prompting further scrutiny of the workings of Gupta's empire and the role of his eastern European steelworks. </p> <p>GFG transferred money from two plants in an attempt to settle a debt with AIP in relation to the Dunkirk smelter, DD's Rob Smith and the FT's Sylvia Pfeifer <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/f85b6c10-52bf-4913-9d39-bde5d30b0149\">revealed</a>.</p> <p>GFG last year said the buyout group's refusal to accept a $180mn transfer to repay a debt was made in “bad faith” in an effort to “appropriate” the smelter.</p> <p>AIP has rejected the allegation, arguing that accepting the payment might have constituted a “benefit from criminal conduct”, after it claimed the French government told it “there were grounds to believe” the funds had been “misappropriated” from a steel mill in eastern Europe.</p> <p>Documents seen by the FT appear to confirm that money flowed from Gupta's eastern European steel business to a UK company that then sought to repay AIP, showing just how freely Gupta shifted funds between the unrelated entities that make up his metals empire.</p> <h2>Crisis managing the House of Mouse</h2> <p><strong>Kristina Schake </strong>is well versed in navigating contentious social issues.</p> <p>The public relations veteran fought against childhood obesity as head of communications for the former first lady <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> and faced off against the <strong>Trump</strong> campaign's PR machine as <strong>Hillary Clinton'</strong>s publicist during her failed 2016 presidential run.</p> <p>But her biggest challenge yet may await in <em>The Happiest Place on Earth</em>.</p> <p>The California native has just landed one of the hottest seats in corporate PR at <strong>Disney</strong>. It's also one of the most daunting.</p> <p>Her predecessor <strong>Geoff Morrell</strong>, who joined in January from <strong>BP</strong>, lasted just three months at the entertainment giant before <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97576f86-9876-45fa-b5f0-b377ca106802\">leaving in a cloud of controversy</a> after overseeing Disney's messy handling of Florida's so-called “Don't Say Gay” law, which prompted sharp criticism from employees and provoked a fight with Florida's Republican governor, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>.</p> <p>Schake has her work cut out. Employees are still angry about Disney's handling of the polarising bill and its aftermath. Criticism has also been directed at the chief executive <strong>Bob Chapek </strong>for waiting too long to issue a public statement condemning the bill, which was enacted into law last month.</p> <p>Moreover, DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b50f2f2e-591a-49bb-a4f3-ae2709c62440\">signed a bill</a> last month to revoke the entertainment group's decades-old ability to govern the 25,000 acres around the Walt Disney World theme park, a move widely seen as retaliation over the company's criticism of his LGBTQ+ policies. So far, Disney hasn't said publicly how it plans to fight back.</p> <p>Disney's LGBTQ+ employees could view Schake's arrival as a welcome change given her past advocacy work. Chapek, meanwhile, will probably lean on Schake's decades of experience navigating power circles in Hollywood and Washington to leverage power in both.</p> <p>Getting employees and upper management to embrace each other is another thing.</p> <p>“Disney likely has more LGBTQ employees than several corporations combined” who would continue to hold his feet to the fire, <strong>Benjamin Siemon</strong>, a TV writer who has been a fierce critic of the company's response tweeted this week.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Biogen </strong>chief executive <strong>Michel Vounatsos</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd522a6b-d187-4aed-83d9-fcfacc226332\">will step down</a> following the disastrous launch of the company's Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> has hired<strong> Nadav Tomer</strong> as an operating adviser to CD&amp;R funds, focused on healthcare investing.
