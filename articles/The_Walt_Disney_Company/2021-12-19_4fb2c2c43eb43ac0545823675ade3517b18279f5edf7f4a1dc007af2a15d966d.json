  "title": "Disney and YouTube Reach Deal, Ending Blackout; Agreement ends a standoff that left YouTube TV subscribers without Disney channels for much of the weekend",
  "text": "<p>Terms of the new contract weren't disclosed.</p><p>The standoff was over distribution fees that Google's YouTube TV pays to stream a package of channels owned by Disney, whose holdings include the ABC broadcast network and its local stations as well as more than dozen cable channels.</p><p>\"We apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience as we continued to negotiate on your behalf. We also value Disney's partnership and willingness to work towards an agreement,\" a YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement. YouTube parent Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc.</p><p>A Disney spokeswoman said in a statement that the company appreciates \"Google's collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market.\"</p><p>Besides fees, another sticking point was YouTube TV's request for a clause that would guarantee it pays the same rate as distributors of a similar size, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>YouTube TV promised it would drop its monthly subscription price to $49.99 from $64.99 as long as the channels were unavailable. To make good on that promise, YouTube TV said it will grant a one-time $15 credit to affected subscribers.</p><p>Disney and YouTube Reach Deal, Ending Blackout</p>",
