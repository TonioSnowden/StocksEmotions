  "title": "ViacomCBS Wants to Lure Big Producers With Ownership Stakes in BET Venture; BET Studios, controlled by ViacomCBS, is offering creative executives equity positions in lieu of big cash guarantees",
  "text": "<p>Rather than simply offering creators payment upfront or royalties if their shows become syndicated, ViacomCBS is also promising equity stakes in the new venture to persuade producers to sign exclusive deals.</p><p>So far, BET Studios has signed a handful of exclusive TV deals with producers and actors including Mr. Thomas, \"Black-ish\" creator Kenya Barris and \"Parks and Recreation\" actress Rashida Jones, said Aisha Summers-Burke, general manager of BET Studios.</p><p>\"I think it's important to go after the up-and-comers, the ones that aren't on everybody's radar, so that you can build a relationship with those creatives that's long-lasting,\" Ms. Summers-Burke said.</p><p>BET was founded in 1980 by former cable-industry lobbyist Robert L. Johnson, who wanted to create a cable channel with shows aimed at Black audiences that were created by Black producers. As the traditional TV business has been threatened by cord-cutting and streaming video, BET has looked to adapt, launching the streaming service BET+. The new venture, BET Studios, will produce content to be distributed across a variety of networks and services.</p><p>ViacomCBS declined to disclose detailed financial information for BET Studios. A person familiar with the matter said the company plans to spend at least $300 million on content in its first several years of operations and already has at least seven projects set up for networks and streaming services at ViacomCBS. ViacomCBS will have majority control of the venture.</p><p>ViacomCBS is betting the new venture's approach to talent deals will help it compete for content in a market fueled by the rise of video streaming. The company has occasionally written big checks to recruit Hollywood showrunners, as it did this year with \"Yellowstone\" creator Taylor Sheridan. But it has mostly avoided splashy, nine-figure production deals, such as the one Netflix Inc. has with \"Grey's Anatomy\" creator Shonda Rhimes or the deal AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia has with \"Star Wars\" director J.J. Abrams.</p><p>The establishment of BET Studios is part of a yearslong effort at ViacomCBS to transform the company's traditional TV networks, including children-focused Nickelodeon and pop-culture oriented MTV, into content factories for a range of streaming services and networks. BET Studios will create content for Paramount+, ViacomCBS's flagship streaming service, as well as rival services that could include Netflix.</p><p>BET Networks President Scott Mills said he fleshed out the plan for BET Studios last year with David Nevins, a top ViacomCBS content executive.</p><p>\"There's unprecedented demand for content from Black creators,\" Mr. Mills said. \"The structure that we've created is really resonating with talent, but it's also resonating with the buyers.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are the pros and cons of ViacomCBS's approach? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Nevins said he recognized the increased importance of stories created by Black artists in Hollywood after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.</p><p>In an interview following the protests sparked by Mr. Floyd's death, Mr. Thomas said: \"no perspective is going to change until you have more diversity of life experience, ethnicity and world views.\"</p><p>ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish said he liked the idea for the new venture, but he wanted to structure the deals so that BET Studios could grant additional ownership stakes to creators as the studio grew. So he proposed structuring the studio's ownership like a partnership in a law firm, where employees can sell their shares back to the enterprise, which can then issue the shares to new partners.</p><p>\"This allows us to set up BET Studios in a perpetual model, where we can continue to bring in young talent,\" Mr. Bakish said.</p><p>Mr. Barris, who has produced shows for Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc., said he was drawn to the idea of getting substantial equity in the new studio. He asked Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos to let him out of the deal he had with the streaming juggernaut.</p><p>\"As the world-class businessman and humanitarian he is, it would be hard for him to deny me equity in a studio, as a Black man,\" said Mr. Barris.</p><p>A Netflix spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Barris has maintained a business relationship with the streaming service, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mr. Barris said he is intrigued by the prospect of reimagining popular genres of movies and TV from a Black perspective. He mentioned true crime as one area that is ripe for reinvention, citing Francis Ford Coppola's \"Godfather\" trilogy and Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" as inspiration. He also suggested musical theater as another promising genre, noting the monumental influence of Black musicians on America's discography.</p><p>\"I feel like we're the most musical people in the world, and musicals almost never fail,\" Mr. Barris said. \"Why are we not doing more musicals?\"</p><p>Write to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com</p><p>ViacomCBS Wants to Lure Big Producers With Ownership Stakes in BET Venture</p>",
