Escapist fantasies (\"The Mandalorian,\" \"WandaVision\"), period dramas (\"The Crown,\" \"Bridgerton\") and immersive comedies (\"The Flight Attendant,\" \"Cobra Kai\") are among the series vying for wins in top categories.</p><p>Netflix is expected to have a good night. The streaming service came into Sunday's ceremony with 34 wins already, more than twice the amount received by closest competitors Disney+ (13) and HBO/HBO Max (10). Those preliminary wins, which count toward the Emmy grand totals, were handed out last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, honoring technical categories such as cinematography and casting.</p><p>While Netflix has a good shot at its first-ever win for best drama with \"The Crown,\" a newer streamer, Apple TV+, has designs on outstanding comedy series, thanks to the popularity of \"Ted Lasso.\"</p><p>More than ever, the competition hinges on streaming content. Broadcast and basic cable networks only account for two of the eight series nominated for best drama—\"This Is Us\" (NBC) and \"Pose\" (FX)—and only one best-comedy nominee—\"black-ish\" (ABC).</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>Emmys 2021 Kick Off With High Expectations for 'The Crown,' 'Ted Lasso'</p>",
