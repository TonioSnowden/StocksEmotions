  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  On Trend:  His Famed Bombers  Roar Back From '90s  ----  By Jacob Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>   Jeff Hamilton likes to say that from 2004 to 2019 he was retired -- done with the clothing industry in which he had toiled for decades. But during his supposed retirement, Mr. Hamilton still made dozens of custom, unlike-anything-else leather jackets each year. The clients just kept calling. </p><p>   If his name isn't familiar, you've certainly seen Mr. Hamilton's work. In the '90s, it seemed that nearly every pop culture figure worth their MTV News segment wore one of his jackets: Madonna, Vanilla Ice, LL Cool J, even Nelson Mandela. He made the  rainbow-striped shell Nascar legend Jeff Gordon raced in. When the Lakers won the NBA championship in 2001, the trophy-stitched jackets Kobe Bryant and team wore were of Mr. Hamilton's creation. </p><p>   Constructed by painstakingly layering strips of multicolored leather, Mr. Hamilton's American-made bombers have depicted everything from American flags to Pablo Escobar's smirking visage. They fall somewhere between pop art and streetwear. </p><p>   Today, Mr. Hamilton's semiretirement is officially over: He's collaborating with Missoni and Supreme, making one-off jackets for rappers The Game and Anuel AA and working on a new ready-to-wear apparel line. And with nearly five million followers on Instagram, Mr. Hamilton himself is now as much a celebrity as his clients. </p><p>   Born Jeff Bohbot, the designer, now 67, grew up in France, married at 19 and had two children all before immigrating to California at 24. The relocation was partly inspired by his love of the \"Showtime\" Los Angeles Lakers.\"I spent a lot of time watching basketball,\" he said. \"I always wanted to realize the American dream.\" </p><p>   And he did. While hustling around the Los Angeles's garment center, Mr. Hamilton regularly rode the elevator with another well-heeled French-speaking fellow: Georges Marciano, one of the brothers behind Guess jeans. </p><p>   \"We hit it off,\" said Mr. Hamilton. \"We were always dressed nice, we wore cashmere sweaters and pink socks and loafers.\" He was often so tan, friends started calling him Jeff Hamilton after the similarly toasted actor George Hamilton. </p><p>   The name stuck. </p><p>   Soon, Mr. Hamilton had the license to design the men's line for Guess. He had no design experience, no green card and spoke no English. But the deal worked: Within three years, he said, the men's label was doing around $75 million in sales. </p><p>   Mr. Hamilton's friendship with the Marcianos withered, and with it, his relationship with Guess. But his next idea was already in place, driven by a love for motorcycles. </p><p>   Throughout the '80s, Mr. Hamilton tooled around the city on a $25,000 \"crazy-fancy\" custom Harley-Davidson wearing extravagant \"Easy Rider\" meets Peter Max jackets, all of his own design. Acquaintances kept asking where they could get one of these for themselves. A business was born. </p><p>   Celebrities came calling. George Michael ordered a custom piece. Gutter-mouthed comedian Andrew Dice Clay snatched up several to wear on stage. And Mr. Hamilton met Michael Jordan, and sold him jackets, through Magic Johnson, who had asked the designer to produce coats for some Lakers. </p><p>   Mr. Hamilton's relationship with the NBA blossomed into a formal partnership. In 1997, he produced jackets for the league's 50 greatest players in honor of its 50th anniversary, and did it again this year for the league's 75th anniversary. (He signed them, as he signs all the custom jackets.) </p><p>   His designs became coveted by rappers like LL Cool J and Snoop Dogg and their fans. \"I'm blessed to be respected by their community,\" said Mr. Hamilton, who was name-checked in a song by Cam'ron. </p><p>   Mr. Hamilton branched out through more-affordable off-the-rack designs: At their peak, his companies held over 40 licenses to make jackets with official NBA, NHL, Disney, Warner Bros., Betty Boop, Coca-Cola and Nascar iconography. </p><p>   Mr. Hamilton sold his wholesale business in the mid-2000s, expecting to fade back from the commercial fashion industry. Then in 2020, he received a fateful Instagram message from A$AP Rocky. The Harlem rapper wanted a custom jacket for the Yams Day concert in Brooklyn. </p><p>   Mr. Hamilton didn't have enough time to make a new jacket, so he offered the rapper one from his own closet. Naturally, Rocky selected -- and was photographed heavily in -- the Lakers championship style that Mr. Bryant wore in the early 2000s. </p><p>   Nine days later, Mr. Bryant died in a helicopter crash. The concert publicity put Mr. Hamilton back in the spotlight. </p><p>   \"I started getting bombarded with people wanting the jacket,\" he said. He restarted a full-fledged commercial label. Today, the Jeff Hamilton brand sells all-leather jackets for $6,000 (including that Lakers design for Kobe fans), and $850 wool and leather varsities. The designs will be in 300 department stores and boutiques by next year. </p><p>   Custom designs can stretch well into the five figures, but to Mr. Hamilton they're more art than apparel. </p><p>   \"You don't need a Jeff Hamilton because you're cold,\" he said. \"You want to make a statement.\" </p><p></p>",
