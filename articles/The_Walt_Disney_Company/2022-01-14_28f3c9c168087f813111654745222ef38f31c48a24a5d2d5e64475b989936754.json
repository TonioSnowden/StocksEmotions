  "title": "'The Original Bambi' Review: Afterlife of a Fawn; A fresh translation of a classic tale restores the author's original vision.",
  "text": "<p>Published as a book in 1923, \"Bambi\" was an immediate hit with the public, but it might have remained solely a German-language sensation had it not been translated into English a few years later by, of all people, the American writer (as well as secret communist and future Soviet spy) Whittaker Chambers. The 1928 Chambers translation, introduced by the English novelist John Galsworthy and illustrated by the great Kurt Wiese, brought Bambi's story to a vast swath of new readers and, eventually, to the attention of Walt Disney.</p><p>20 Books We Read This Week</p><p>Everyday revolutionaries in 1776, the terrible aftermath of the Third Reich, wealth meets witchcraft in an alternate-reality London and much more.</p><p>Salten (1869-1945) didn't intend \"Bambi\" to be a story for children, but it began to become one with the first English edition. Wiese's tender illustrations and Chambers's gentle language combined to give a certain softness to the telling. The 1942 animated Disney film completed the book's transformation in the public mind, obliterating the allegorical portrayal of suffering and persecution that had got the book banned in Nazi Germany. The Disney movie wowed the world with its heavenly choirs and swelling orchestral music; its playful animal pals and treacly scenes of long-lashed, eye-batting courtship; its noble stags and ignoble, unseen human hunters. It also included one of the most distressing moments in family cinema, when Bambi and his mother are dashing for safety across a meadow and a shot rings out. \"Mother!\" the fawn calls. \"Mother! Mother?\"</p><p>Multiple theatrical releases of the film over many decades have, for countless viewers, made the doe's killing into a shared cultural trauma. Ask people about Bambi, and if they've seen the film—especially if they saw it as children—and the response is typically a shudder and a muttered mention of \"that scene with Bambi's mother.\"</p><p>Interestingly, the scene is a rare example of Disney having intensified rather than lessened an element of the original story that was, as a new translation reveals, almost unremittingly dark and pessimistic to begin with. In \"The Original Bambi: The Story of a Life in the Forest,\" the distinguished translator Jack Zipes, professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota, has sought to restore both the dignity and the relevance of Salten's vision; to rescue it, in a manner of speaking, from Disneyfication.</p><p>\"Salten's novel is a brilliant and profound story of how minority groups throughout the world have been brutally treated, even when they try to live peacefully in their own environment,\" Mr. Zipes writes in his introduction. \"Read in the original language and in its sociohistorical context, Bambi is, if anything, dystopic and sobering, for it reveals the cutthroat manner in which powerless people are hunted and persecuted for sport.\"</p><p>In the novel's central chapter, the woods are gripped by cold and ice, and there's an ominous feel in the air. \"It was quiet in the forest,\" Salten writes, \"but something horrible happened every day.\" Crows have lately attacked and killed a young hare. A marten has mutilated a squirrel. \"On another day a fox tore apart the strong and handsome pheasant who had enjoyed general respect and popularity . . . ,\" we read. \"No one could have felt safer than the pheasant. . . . Yet, it all happened in broad daylight.\"</p><p>Then come hunters, and the unleashing of mass terror: the thunder of gunshots, winged corpses falling from the sky, blood on the snow, creatures shrieking and whimpering and stampeding. Bambi's mother shouts at him to run, and, with relief, he obeys: \"Finally, he felt he could unleash his pent-up desire to get away from the tumult and far from His [Man's] scent, which seemed to drive him into a frenzy and open up the desperate urge to flee, the longing to save himself. He ran. It seemed to him as if he saw his mother stumble, but he didn't know whether it was really her or not.\"</p><p>Illustrator Alenka Sottler depicts the scene across two full pages. In her stippled, monochrome picture, deer, badgers, hares, mice, boars and birds all stream past colossal tree trunks in an effort to escape an organized party of armed men. It isn't difficult to imagine this pogrom-like assault in its \"sociohistorical context.\" Days later, in the aftermath of the attack, there comes a dispassionate reckoning. \"Bambi never saw his mother again.\"</p><p>Given the baleful influence of humankind and particularly of hunters in Bambi's world, it may come as a surprise to learn that Felix Salten, a passionate animal lover, was also a hunter. He was born Siegmund Salzmann in Pest, Hungary, but moved with his family in babyhood to Vienna and in adolescence changed his name, as Mr. Zipes writes, in an effort to assimilate and \"unmark\" himself as a Jew. He dropped out of school at 16, continued his education at a free library, and worked his way into the city's glittering bohemian world of arts and letters. He wrote theater reviews, animal stories and erotica; he became editor of the newspaper Die Zeit, got married, socialized with aristocrats, philandered, had two children; and in 1938 fled Nazi-occupied Austria with his wife for asylum in Switzerland. Five years earlier he had parted with the film rights for \"Bambi\" for $1,000.</p><p>Mr. Zipes faults the celebrated Chambers translation—which was widely reviewed and became a Book-of-the-Month Club selection—for its textual infidelity. Chambers failed, Mr. Zipes writes \"to capture Salten's unusual Viennese style of writing and anthropomorphism. Moreover, he mistranslates many German idioms, omits phrases, and does not convey Salten's profound personal and philosophical dilemma.\" Mr. Zipes doesn't speculate—but we can—as to whether Whittaker Chambers, who was soon to join Stalin's payroll, might have had an interest in altering Salten's work not just to make a pleasing English-language family story but also to mitigate its searing portrayal of the totalitarian oppression of innocents.</p><p>If Chambers was engaged in such political legerdemain, given that his translation informed the Disney movie that became, in time, all that most people know of \"Bambi,\" this new edition by Mr. Zipes is doubly welcome. \"Bambi: The Story of a Life in the Forest\" is a bleak book, occasionally stilted in its language but also bracingly free of the encrustation of sugar that the tale has accumulated over the past 100 years. It's a funny thing, though: Both Felix Salten and Jack Zipes owe a debt of gratitude to Walt Disney. Had Bambi not been Disneyfied, we probably wouldn't be talking about him at all.</p><p>Mrs. Gurdon is the Journal's children's-book columnist.</p><p>'The Original Bambi' Review: Afterlife of a Fawn</p>",
