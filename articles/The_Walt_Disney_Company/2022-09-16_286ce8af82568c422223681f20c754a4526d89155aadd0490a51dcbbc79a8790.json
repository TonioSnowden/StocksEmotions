  "text": "<p>Walt Disney Co.</p><p>A prominent Disney investor no longer wants to turn off ESPN. Activist billionaire Dan Loeb on Twitter signaled he was backing off on persuading the entertainment giant to spin off its popular sports television network, after his hedge fund Third Point LLC last month renewed its stake in Disney stock. The switch followed Disney CEO Bob Chapek's recent statement at its D23 Expo that he plans for ESPN to be a big growth engine and a large part of Disney's entertainment offerings. The idea of selling ESPN came up frequently in recent years as the price of sports broadcast rights rose. Disney shares gained 1.1% Monday.</p><p>Peloton Interactive Inc.</p><p>One of Peloton's original leaders is leaving the race to turn the fitness-equipment maker around. Co-founder John Foley, who led the company for most of its 10-year existence before stepping down as CEO in February, resigned as executive chairman as other top officers also departed. Peloton struggled this year with deepening losses and a glut of unsold bicycles as consumers return to gyms and outdoor activities. The announcement came weeks after Peloton reported a $1.2 billion quarterly loss and a nearly 30% drop in revenue. Peloton shares lost 10% Tuesday.</p><p>Rent the Runway Inc.</p><p>More customers are hanging up their subscriptions to Rent the Runway. The fashion rental service on Monday said it would reduce its corporate workforce by 24%, primarily through layoffs, as it adjusts to a drop in its active subscriber count in the latest quarter. CEO Jenn Hyman said roughly 20% of business is coming from shoppers seeking work clothes, a much smaller percentage than before the pandemic. Many shoppers are shifting their buying behavior as they react to high inflation, squeezing retailers such as Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Rent the Runway shares plummeted 39% Tuesday.</p><p>Starbucks Corp.</p><p>Starbucks has a plan to give its service a jolt. Interim Chief Executive Howard Schultz on Tuesday outlined a revamp of the coffee chain, saying the company will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to update store designs and equipment in order to speed service and make work easier for its baristas. The company aims to reduce employee turnover after confronting worker frustration and a union push over the past year. Mr. Schultz said stepped-up spending on cafe operations and worker benefits would pay off in higher sales and profits. Starbucks shares gained 5.5% Wednesday.</p><p>Union Pacific Corp.</p><p>Union Pacific and other rail giants kept their operations from running off track. The biggest freight railroads and union leaders on Thursday reached a tentative labor agreement to avert a nationwide strike that would have crippled segments of the U.S. economy. President Biden and White House officials interceded to broker the deal that came less than 24 hours before a Friday deadline that could have led to a nationwide shutdown of rail operations. Union Pacific, BNSF Railway Co., CSX Corp., and Norfolk Southern Corp. have been in contract talks with unions since late 2019 concerning pay and working conditions. Union Pacific added 0.2% Thursday.</p><p>Gap Inc.</p><p>Ye told Gap nay. The rapper Kanye West on Thursday formally notified the apparel chain that he was terminating their partnership that began in 2020 with the development of a clothing collection under the Yeezy Gap brand. A letter from Mr. West's lawyers said Gap breached the agreement by not releasing apparel and opening retail stores as planned. Mark Breitbard, president and chief executive of the Gap brand, told employees in a memo that the company and Mr. West are \"not aligned\" in how they work together. Gap still plans to release coming Yeezy Gap items in the pipeline. Gap shares fell 3.6% Thursday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>FedEx, Starbucks, Gap: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
