  "title": "What Happened to Disney's Florida 'Stakeholders'? Businesses that claim to have a greater purpose than serving shareholders often end up serving a lesser political agenda.",
  "text": "<p>Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate.</p><p>Disney's intervention into Florida politics highlights again the problems that arise when businesses stray from their central purpose of creating long-term value for shareholders. This column has been criticizingthe 2019 decision by the Business Roundtable to rewrite its principles. All but a handful of the CEOs of large corporations that comprise the group's membership agreed that year that a corporation should not simply focus on serving shareholders but instead commit to serving a larger universe of vaguely defined \"stakeholders.\"</p><p>The Business Roundtable's rewrite was a mistake because serving the long-term interests of shareholders necessarily requires executives to treat non-owners fairly—to attract and retain a talented workforce, to provide good value for consumers, to deal reasonably with suppliers, and to respect the laws and customs wherever a business operates. On the other hand, \"stakeholders\" are often activists pursuing political agendas that they couldn't persuade voters to approve and for which they won't have to pay. There's no good reason to elevate their gripes above the interests of others. Milton Friedman, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize in economics, explained more than half a century ago the flaws in such declarations:</p><p>What does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a \"social responsibility\" in his capacity as businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he is to act in some way that is not in the interest of his employers.</p><p>This brings us to Disney and its CEO Bob Chapek, who seems to have decided that some \"stakeholders\" should drive corporate activism while other \"stakeholders\" should be ignored. Mr. Chapek's signature appears on the Roundtable's current version of its policy:</p><p>Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation</p><p>Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity. We believe the free-market system is the best means of generating good jobs, a strong and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy environment and economic opportunity for all.</p><p>Businesses play a vital role in the economy by creating jobs, fostering innovation and providing essential goods and services. Businesses make and sell consumer products; manufacture equipment and vehicles; support the national defense; grow and produce food; provide health care; generate and deliver energy; and offer financial, communications and other services that underpin economic growth.</p><p>While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders.</p><p>The statement continues and specifically includes the following pledge:</p><p>Supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.</p><p>Time will tell how sustainable Disney's business is over the long term. But how supportive and respectful is a company that presumes to tell the community of Florida parents that they must accept state-sponsored instruction in gender identity for six-year-olds?</p><p>In March, after the parental rights bill had passed Florida's duly-elected state senate, Mr. Chapek issued a statement on behalf of Disney suggesting it was a \"challenge to basic human rights.\"</p><p>This column must have missed the section of the Constitution guaranteeing government employees the right to give sexuality lectures in kindergarten classrooms.</p><p>Voters and shareholders beware, Mr. Chapek also announced that he will be using Disney resources to promote his corporate social agenda nationwide:</p><p>Starting immediately, we are increasing our support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states.</p><p>Does he not even wish to learn what the \"stakeholders\" in those other states want for their children? Apparently not, and this should not come as a surprise given the lack of respect he's extending to his stakeholders in Florida.</p><p>Also, how do Disney shareholders benefit from Mr. Chapek's foray into cultural politics? Some may want to sell their stakes and instead buy shares in a business where the CEO demonstrates corporate responsibility—to the owners.</p><p>***</p><p>This column has been clarified to note that Mr. Chapek's statement was issued after passage of the bill by the Florida state senate but before enactment.</p><p>***</p><p>Mr. Freeman will host \"WSJ at Large\" this Friday at 7:30 pm EDT on the Fox Business Network. The program repeats at 9:30 am and 11:00 am EDT on Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>What Happened to Disney's Florida 'Stakeholders'?</p>",
