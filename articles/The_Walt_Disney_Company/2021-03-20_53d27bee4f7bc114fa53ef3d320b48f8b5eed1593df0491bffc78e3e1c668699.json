  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>The <strong>National Football League</strong> announced new broadcasting contracts this week, reportedly worth as much as $110bn over 11 years. This includes renewed and enhanced agreements with <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>ViacomCBS</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>'s <strong>NBC</strong>, <strong>News Corp</strong>'s <strong>Fox</strong>, and <strong>Disney</strong>'s <strong>ESPN </strong>and <strong>ABC</strong>. Read the details <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0d7f203-568a-47bc-b068-076e22604802\">here</a>.</p> <p>It's an extraordinary deal, the largest in sports media rights anywhere in the world. Don't count on other sports leagues getting similarly big TV contracts in future. Analysts have long warned that ailing broadcasters will focus their money on buying “super premium” events like the NFL. That might mean less cash for other less-followed sports. It's a story we'll be following closely.</p> <p><em>In this edition of Scoreboard, we explain the battle for control over football's Champions League, consider if sports betting is the answer to US college sport's overreliance on media rights, tally the costs of competing in sailing's America's Cup, and more.</em></p> <p><em>Send us tips and feedback at </em><a href=\"mailto:scoreboard@ft.com\"><em>scoreboard@ft.com</em></a><em>.

For everyone else, let's go.&#xa0;</em></p> <h1>Clubs battle for control over the Champions League</h1> <p>The <strong>Champions League</strong>, Europe's top club football competition, is set for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c986a6ff-d653-4e01-aae2-b02d1d9715a9\">dramatic makeover</a>.</p> <p><strong>Uefa</strong>, European football's governing body, and the <strong>European Club Association</strong>, a trade body that represents the interests of 200 leading sides, are close to agreeing sweeping changes to the tournament in which €2bn is distributed to participating clubs each year.&#xa0;</p> <p>This includes revamping the group stage. Currently, teams are placed in groups of four, playing each other home and away. That would be replaced by the “Swiss system”, a model used in chess competitions. Each side plays 10 matches against entirely different opponents. The best ranked teams then qualify for the knockout rounds.&#xa0;</p> <p>Crucially, every club would be guaranteed at least four more money-spinning European games each season.&#xa0;</p> <p>While these format changes have been subject to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f2e11fa-33e5-4bb9-ab79-3b706b516237\">fierce and public debate</a>, less is known about a related, behind-the-scenes drama: a battle for control over the business of European club competitions.</p> <p>These talks were hinted at by <strong>Ed Woodward</strong>, executive vice-chair of <strong>Manchester United</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c47fd20-6950-4387-8067-07848db60617\">last month</a>. Asked by investors about format changes, he said that any proposal needs “greater involvement of clubs in the governance and control of the competitions.”</p> <p>The FT revealed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d264e68-0291-42e6-b896-f78738e6aed7#comments-anchor\">details on Friday</a> on what Woodward's cryptic clue means. Uefa and ECA are in discussions over a joint venture that would control all commercial matters related to European club tournaments.</p> <p>Why does this matter? Uefa currently has sole and final decision-making power over media rights auctions and sponsorship deals related to Champions League matches.</p> <p>The new model would give the ECA, led by <strong>Andrea Agnelli</strong>, president of Italy's <strong>Juventus</strong>, an equal say on the terms of future commercial contracts.</p> <p>A person briefed on the talks told Scoreboard that clubs are more interested in these governance proposals than the format changes. That's because top sides care most about developing new ways to increase their revenues.</p> <p>Here's a small example. At Champions League matches, the competition's main sponsors, such as <strong>Mastercard</strong> and <strong>Heineken</strong>, are the ones most prominently seen on advertising hoardings around the pitch.&#xa0;</p> <p>Some clubs would like to end that arrangement, so their own sponsors are better featured and so increase the value of each team's marketing deals.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's a bigger example. You could sell a share in the newly-created company that controls the Champions League's commercial rights. Private equity firms <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1c7b456-4ab0-4a88-a993-bc80856cbc20\">in talks to acquire stakes</a> in other competitions, such as Italy's <strong>Serie A</strong>, may jump at the opportunity to buy into one of the world's most watched sporting contests.</p> <p>“Big financial powerhouses see that there is value to be created in our industry,” said Agnelli earlier this month. Top clubs are manoeuvring to realise that value for themselves.</p> <p><em>Read the FT exclusive on the battle to control the Champions League </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d264e68-0291-42e6-b896-f78738e6aed7#comments-anchor\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>March Madness matters most for US college sports</h1> <p>Among the most unique American sports traditions is the annual men's college basketball tournament known as <strong>March Madness</strong>, which tipped off on Friday. Dozens of teams face off in six rounds of single-elimination games to determine a national champion, yielding two weeks of upsets and buzzer-beaters.</p> <p>The tournament is a television bonanza, with media rights worth more than $700m per year. But the real mania hinges on the fact that those media rights comprise virtually all — a whopping 85 per cent — of the annual revenues for the <strong>National Collegiate Athletic Association</strong>, the governing body of US college sport.</p> <p>Over-reliance on a single revenue stream is a risk in any business. The NCAA felt that in 2020, when the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to the abrupt cancellation of its cash cow.&#xa0;</p> <p>A completed tournament is essential to the NCAA this year, which is simultaneously fighting existential crises on both legal and political fronts.&#xa0;</p> <p>On March 31, the <strong>US Supreme Court</strong> will hear arguments in a potentially landmark antitrust case against the NCAA, which could determine whether it is able to cap compensation for college athletes, who are famously <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0f53c1c-2be5-4878-9b41-1286b9bea368\">not paid</a>, at the cost of attending university.&#xa0;</p> <p>Those athletes are increasingly vocal about not getting a share of the more than $8bn college sports industry. This week, several men's basketball stars including <strong>Jordan Bohannon </strong>of <strong>Iowa</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanBo_3\">launched a hashtag</a>, #NotNCAAProperty, calling for compensation reform and a Supreme Court finding in favour of the plaintiffs in the <strong>NCAA vs Alston</strong> case.&#xa0;</p> <p>At the same time, the NCAA says it's not ready to tap the most vigorous new revenue stream in US sports business: legal sports betting.&#xa0;</p> <p>Chief operating officer <strong>Donald Remy</strong> told Scoreboard “we're a little different than a professional organisation” such as the <strong>National Football League</strong>, which licenses its data to sports books for wagering.</p> <p>That hasn't prevented university sports departments from doing the same, like <a href=\"https://cubuffs.com/news/2020/9/8/general-cu-pointsbet-announce-corporate-partnership.aspx\">the <strong>University of Colorado</strong></a>. Other schools have adopted in-stadium <a href=\"https://msuspartans.com/news/2021/3/11/general-rocket-mortgage-greatly-expands-partnership-with-michigan-state-university-athletics-continues-role-as-official-mortgage-provider.aspx\">title sponsors for their teams</a>, like the <strong>MSU Spartans Presented by Rocket Mortgage</strong>.</p> <p>Asked if MSU's marketing move jives with US college sports being different from a professional league, Remy said: “It's definitely an interesting approach for new revenue. It perplexes me.”</p> <p><em>Read the full FT interview with the NCAA's executives </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9743194f-e352-4327-98ec-b9def1fbbb04\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>The high cost of winning the America's Cup</h1> <p>When the <strong>America's Cup</strong> first took place 170 years ago, the winners of sailing's most prestigious event took home a trophy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfc0d884-f004-11e9-a55a-30afa498db1b\">valued at £100</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>This week, <strong>Team New Zealand</strong> retained the same silverware, known as the “Auld Mug,” by beating Italian challenger <strong>Luna Rossa</strong>. That victory was due to helmsman <strong>John Burling</strong>'s mastery of winds, sailing a boat that was a technological marvel, and wielding a budget worth tens of millions of dollars.</p> <p>To claim the America's Cup, money matters. The rules of the contest are set by the previous victors, who get to choose everything from the location of the next race to the design of the boats. Effectively, they can stack conditions in their favour.&#xa0;</p> <p>After beating a US team in 2019 in Bermuda, Team New Zealand chose to sail in home waters around Auckland and to race in expensive 75-foot foiling monohulls.&#xa0;</p> <p>These boats have large foil arms that allow the boat to glide out of the water at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. The costly design left at least three potential challengers withdrawing from the competition before it started.&#xa0;</p> <p>Spare a thought then, for the British team, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7893430e-4956-11e8-8ae9-4b5ddcca99b3\">backed by £110m</a> from chemical group <strong>Ineos</strong>, owned by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31b5e7e0-5c76-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4\">UK billionaire <strong>Sir Jim Ratcliffe</strong></a>. It lost to Luna Rossa in the qualifying rounds, a swift end to several years of effort aimed at getting into the main race. On Friday, Ineos announced it will continue backing the UK team skippered by <strong>Sir Ben Ainslie</strong> for another tilt in 2023.</p> <p>New Zealand's winning boat this year was built by a syndicate that included funding from big corporate groups including <strong>Emirates Airlines</strong> and <strong>Toyota</strong>, as well as money from the New Zealand government.</p> <p>The need for high-tech engineering and paying the wages of the world's best sailors tends to mean teams require the benefaction of rich tycoons. Past outfits were backed by the likes of banker <strong>J Pierpont Morgan</strong> and <strong>Oracle</strong> founder <strong>Larry Ellison</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The clear beneficiaries of all this lavish spending should have been Auckland. A 2017 report by the New Zealand government assessed the impact of the expected arrival of superyachts owned by some of the world's richest people to watch the America's Cup.&#xa0;</p> <p>It predicted the influx would lead to NZ$300m ($217m) of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/sports/sailing/americas-cup-superyachts.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\">direct spending </a>in the local economy. But the pandemic led New Zealand to largely closing its borders to the outside world.</p> <p>Still, the victory was celebrated in the island nation. “Following a hard year, Team New Zealand provided such optimism and excitement,” wrote Prime Minister <strong>Jacinda Ardern </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMghf8njlWp/\">on Instagram</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>She also committed more taxpayer money to fund the team's defence of the trophy in 2023 — <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/18/new-zealand-scrambles-to-keep-americas-cup-in-home-waters-after-rocketship-wins\">on the condition</a> it takes place in New Zealand. The country is banking on high-rolling yacht owners to make the trip to watch the race in two years' time.</p> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>LeBron James</strong> has taken a stake in<strong> Liverpool FC </strong>and<strong> Boston Red Sox</strong> owner<strong> Fenway Sports Group</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31076745/source-lebron-james-becomes-part-owner-boston-red-sox-joins-fenway-sports-group-partner\">trading up his existing minority position</a> in the English <strong>Premier League </strong>club.
