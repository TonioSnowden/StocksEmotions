  "title": "Technology:  Missing 'Simpsons'  Episode in Hong Kong  Fuels Censorship Fears  ----  By Dan Strumpf",
  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- The absence of an episode of \"The Simpsons\" from Walt Disney Co.'s streaming service in Hong Kong is raising concerns about rising censorship in the Chinese territory. </p><p>   Disney launched its streaming service, Disney+, earlier in November in Hong Kong featuring an array of programming owned by the entertainment giant, including 32 seasons of the animated comedy series. </p><p>   Yet one episode is missing from \"The Simpsons\" lineup: Titled \"Goo Goo Gai Pan,\" the episode from season 16 centers on a trip to China by the show's namesake family. Along the way they encounter a plaque at Tiananmen Square in Beijing that reads: \"On this site, in 1989, nothing happened.\" </p><p>   The episode also features a reference to the iconic \"Tank Man\" photo, in which a man stands in front of a column of tanks after the military moved in to crush student-led protests on June 4, 1989. </p><p>   It isn't known if Disney removed the episode under pressure, or whether it decided itself to leave the episode out of its lineup when it launched the Disney+ service in Hong Kong earlier in November. Representatives for Disney didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Office of the Communications Authority, which oversees broadcasters in the city, declined to comment. </p><p>   The episode's absence fuels concerns about rising censorship in Hong Kong, and the extent to which Western companies are under pressure to assist in the effort or to self-censor following the imposition of a sweeping national security law by Beijing last year that has stamped out dissent across the city. In October, Hong Kong's legislature passed a film censorship law allowing the government to ban films deemed a threat to national security. </p><p>   \"Whether it's self-censorship or whether it's direct censorship, it is based on the calculation of how significant the China market is to Disney, or any other American company,\" said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. \"It is about the China market. And the clear understanding that the Chinese government will not hesitate to use its economic muscle based on the size of its market to get its way.\" </p><p>   Disney has huge business interests in China, a market that it and other Hollywood studios are careful not to offend for fear of losing access. Disney, with resorts in China and Hong Kong and extensive sales from its movie business in the region, has moved aggressively to maintain the peace with China over the years, a fact that has brought it some controversy in the U.S. </p><p>   In 2016, Disney opened Shanghai Disney Resort, a $5.5 billion theme park and entertainment complex that took more than a decade of negotiations with Chinese authorities to mount. The company operates a smaller park in Hong Kong, while its Marvel Studios releases are among China's highest-grossing movies of all time. </p><p>   Yet the company has run afoul of Chinese authorities before. Last year, for example, Disney executives had to defend the decision to film portions of a new \"Mulan\" remake in Xinjiang province, where the Chinese government is believed to house work camps for members of the Uyghur minority. The controversy prompted Chinese authorities to block marketing for the film, which ended up flopping in both Chinese and U.S. theaters. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Erich Schwartzel contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
