  "text": "<p>A breakdown in the baseball relationships that were central to Topps's longtime success was at the heart of the abrupt change of fortune.</p><p>Topps on Thursday was blindsided as its longtime business partners -- MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association -- struck exclusive trading-card agreements with a new company controlled by online sports-merchandise retailer Fanatics Inc., people familiar with the matter said. The NBA and unions representing players in the National Basketball Association and the National Football League were also part of the deal that promises to dramatically shake up the industry.</p><p>The Fanatics talks had been under way for several months, according to people involved in them, yet Topps only learned of them on Thursday, when it received a letter from the MLBPA informing the company it wouldn't be extending its contract with Topps. Topps CEO Michael Brandstaedter also got a call from an MLB executive informing him they would not be renewing their deal with Topps when it expired at the end of 2025.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on the new trading-card deals with the Fanatics-led company shortly thereafter. By then, it was too late for Topps to come back with a counteroffer, some of the people said.</p><p>Topps co-owner Michael Eisner on Thursday afternoon had a brief, heated call with MLB commissioner Rob Manfred asking why he hadn't been given a heads-up or a chance to counter, a person familiar with the discussion said. Mr. Manfred responded the change was in the best interest of MLB's shareholders.</p><p>\"Not only were we unaware that Major League Baseball was negotiating with anybody other than Topps regarding our rights beyond 2025, but we were abruptly informed yesterday at 2:00 p.m. ET . . . that a deal was completed, finalized and exclusive with Fanatics,\" said Andy Redman, executive chairman of Topps in a statement to the Journal. He added that, as recently as the All-Star Game on July 13, representatives of the players \"never indicated to Topps that the Union was negotiating with any other parties about our rights.\"</p><p>The consequences for Topps were immediate. Topps had been in the process of going public later this year through a combination with a special-purpose acquisition company. That deal, which was expected to close Wednesday and had already garnered enough support from shareholders to be approved, fell apart on Friday as the partners in the SPAC deal with Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corp. II agreed to walk away.</p><p>The Mudrick deal had valued the combined entity at about $1.16 billion, the companies said when they announced the deal in April. The MLB and MLBPA deals make up a significant chunk of Topps's revenue, and their exits are expected to decrease the value of the company, cutting into potential investment returns for Mr. Eisner, the former chief executive of Walt Disney Co., and Topps co-owner Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, the private-equity firm. They together had acquired Topps in 2007.</p><p>The MLBPA deal with the new Fanatics-led company begins in 2023. MLB's current agreement with Topps runs through 2025. After that, there are significant questions about how this business, which used baseball cards to fortify an empire, will chart a path forward without those same rights.</p><p>It's far from the days when Topps was the premier card manufacturer for almost every major sport in the U.S. In 2021, it was down to just one chief asset -- the same sport that catapulted its rise.</p><p>\"Baseball is the only sport it has had,\" said Mark Armour, an avid card collector and president of the board of directors at the Society for American Baseball Research.</p><p>Yet despite Topps's reliance on baseball, the company failed to guarantee that the agreement that is effectively its lifeblood would carry on beyond its expiration date, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The idea that Topps could seek to go public through a SPAC without further locking up its primary revenue stream shocked deal makers and people in the private-equity world. These people said that ensuring the MLB contract could be renewed would typically be among the first steps in the due diligence process for a business like Topps.</p><p>Topps got into the baseball-card business in the early 1950s. Topps and rival Bowman competed in those days to sign players to cheap, binding deals when they were minor leaguers. Eventually, Topps bought out Bowman.</p><p>That was the beginning of its decades-long dominance, winning every trading-card war. Its deal with MLB meant it was the only company able to produce cards with team logos. The deal with the players association ensured access to players across the league.</p><p>Going forward, the one asset Topps may be able to lean upon is the same history that lasted the better part of a century. That's reflected by its rich catalog -- and the notorious sentimentality of baseball fans.</p><p>---</p><p>Amrith Ramkumar contributed to this article.</p>",
