  "title": "Netflix Ends Subscriber Addiction Phase on a High Note; Streaming giant gets back to subscriber growth but says it will no longer project that number",
  "text": "<p>Netflix also projected the addition of 4.5 million new subscribers for the fourth quarter—exceeding the 4 million net additions expected by analysts. But if recent experience has taught investors anything, it is that a streaming service with more than 220 million paying subscribers can no longer count on easily signing up lots of new ones consistently. Netflix said Tuesday that it will no longer provide subscriber forecasts with its quarterly reports, preferring instead to focus on revenue, earnings and cash-flow growth as its business model evolves to include things like advertising and paid account sharing.</p><p>That might mean less drama for a company used to seeing its stock swing wildly on that number; Netflix shares have averaged a 10.4% drop in the session following its last six quarterly reports, according to FactSet data. But a reduced focus on subscriber growth still puts Netflix at a slight disadvantage optically to big media companies that were later to streaming and therefore still have the ability to tout impressive growth numbers. Rival Disney is expected to add more than 15 million subscribers to its Disney+ service in the second half of 2022—more than twice what Netflix is on track to do in the same period.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Netflix is going where its big media competitors will need to land eventually—with streaming businesses that are profitable and cash-generating in their own right. The company's harsh comeuppance this year already has helped investors recalibrate their views of the sector; shares of Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery are down by 46% this year on average—more than twice as much as the S&amp;P 500. Including Tuesday's after-hours move, Netflix's shares are down 54% over that time. That might leave room for more gains if new initiatives such as advertising and account-sharing tiers show early promise.</p><p>Even 15 years after getting into streaming, the Netflix show has yet to get boring.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Ends Subscriber Addiction Phase on a High Note</p>",
