  "text": "<p>A prosecutor in Georgia's Fulton County has said she would seek an enhanced punishment under Georgia's new hate-crimes law against the white gunman who killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three Atlanta-area spas. The prosecutor's office in Cherokee County has said that the federal, state and local investigation didn't find evidence of prejudice against Asians. The case was cited in an Aug. 31 U.S. News article about an increase in hate crimes, but the article didn't make clear that prosecutors are divided over whether to pursue the cases as hate crimes.</p><p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said seven Black men, known as the \"Martinsville Seven,\" in 1951 received racially biased death sentences not similarly applied to white defendants convicted of rape. A Sept. 1 U.S. Watch article about posthumous pardons for the men wasn't clear when it said the executions were racially biased due to how the death sentence was used in cases involving white defendants.</p><p>Deutsche Telekom AG's name was misspelled as Deutsche Telecom in some editions Wednesday in a headline with a Business &amp; Finance article about its stake in T-Mobile.</p><p>Fidelity International was granted preliminary approval last month for its mutual-fund operations in China. In some editions Wednesday, a Business &amp; Finance article about BlackRock Inc. incorrectly said Fidelity Investments.</p><p>Walt Disney Co.'s Searchlight Pictures division has no current plans to distribute a new Wes Anderson film that is shooting in Europe and is starring Scarlett Johansson. An Exchange article on Saturday about Disney's salary negotiations with Ms. Johansson said the division will release the film. Separately, the article incorrectly called the division Fox Searchlight, its previous name.</p><p>Serena Williams's last name was misspelled as Wiliams in one reference in a Sports article on Tuesday about tennis player Leylah Fernandez.</p><p>The weekly estimate for the price-to-earnings ratio of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 19.24. Tuesday's Market Digest incorrectly gave the value as 19.26. Separately, the S&amp;P 500's trailing P/E ratio is 31.70, the P/E estimate is 22.27, and the dividend yield is 1.29. Tuesday's Market Digest incorrectly gave the values as 31.26, 22.26 and 1.31, respectively.</p><p>The Central Illinois weekly price for a ton of 48% soybean meal by rail stood at $340.80 on Tuesday, and the Oklahoma City weekly price for feeder steers was $171.625, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The cash prices table on Wednesday incorrectly gave the prices as $350.75 and $170.63, respectively.</p><p>Life-cycle funds, also known as target-date funds, automatically adjust their asset mix over time; they are designed for people expecting to retire in a particular year. These funds are different from lifestyle funds, which generally don't change their asset allocations over time in a predetermined way. The glossary in an Investing in Funds &amp; ETFs article on Tuesday about target-date funds incorrectly used the lifestyle-fund definition for the life-cycle funds.</p><p>A Mansion article on Friday about converting B&amp;Bs into single-family homes contained a photo of a home that was incorrectly identified as the Bed &amp; Breakfast on Tiffany Hill.</p><p>Readers can alert The Wall Street Journal to any errors in news articles by emailing wsjcontact@wsj.com or by calling 888-410-2667.</p><p>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>",
