  "text": "<p>\n  Mr. Chapek also released original titles that skipped the theater, another way to capitalize on the home-video craze. The challenge became convincing consumers that these at-home options were viable alternatives to the theatrical experience. </p><p>\n  \"The retail outlet is the first venue for consumers to view these movies,\" he said in a 1998 interview. \"The premiere is actually taking place in the store.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Chapek embraced technological solutions to vexing problems, not always successfully. In 2003, he oversaw the development of a DVD that self-destructed after 48 hours, an alternative to rentals that he believed would appeal to consumers who wanted to avoid repeat trips to the video store and late fees. The technology, marketed as eZ-D, did not prove economically viable, and environmentalists protested outside a 7-Eleven in Texas that sold the disposable discs for $7 apiece. </p><p>\n  In a preview of today's battles over streaming, Mr. Chapek didn't seem to mind that promoting at-home movies as viable alternatives to the cinema angered theater owners. Starting with the 2010 live-action remake of \"Alice in Wonderland,\" Mr. Chapek pushed DVDs' release dates closer to the movie's theatrical debut, further alienating theater operators. </p><p>\n  When the industry years later was divided over whether to support HD-DVD or Blu-ray as the next generation of home entertainment, Mr. Chapek loudly backed Blu-ray, since he thought it would offer Disney the better chance to pitch consumers on yet another format and sell copies of movies many already owned. He even sent a \"Magical Blu-ray Tour\" across the U.S. in 2008 to educate consumers on the technology. </p><p>\n  Even before Hollywood embraced the notion of \"direct-to-consumer\" businesses -- streaming services like Disney+ and HBO Max that allow studios to circumvent theater owners and other middlemen -- Mr. Chapek had little patience for legacy deals that kept Disney from dealing directly with consumers. Mr. Chapek led discussions about a Disney subscription service as early as 2007, former colleagues say, but existing deals with TV networks meant rights weren't available for crucial movies that such a service would have needed to launch. </p><p>\n  In 2011, Mr. Iger pulled Mr. Chapek out of his movie-distribution job and put him in charge of Disney Consumer Products. It was part of Mr. Iger's succession-planning strategy, which involved placing CEO candidates atop parts of the company where they had little expertise as a way of seeing how they might adapt to the biggest job of all. </p><p>\n  In the new role, Mr. Chapek won favor with his bosses by reorganizing the division around brands like Mickey Mouse, the Disney princesses and Star Wars, rather than around categories like housewares or action figures. The old arrangement led separate product divisions to chase each new movie or TV show in an attempt to hit their numbers. Mr. Chapek's new setup gave subordinates an incentive to keep an eye on each franchise's overall health. </p><p>\n  The overhaul disrupted years of business for Disney's consumer products team -- internal critics said it felt like Mr. Chapek couldn't resist reorganizing any division he ran -- and led to layoffs and turf wars. But it was a hit with Mr. Chapek's boss, Mr. Iger, who was busy organizing the company around the brands -- Disney Animation, Pixar Animation, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm -- that had defined his tenure as CEO. </p><p>\n  After taking over Disney's theme-park division in 2015, Mr. Chapek raised prices -- and started charging even more on holidays and other popular times that strained capacity at the parks. The division's profits grew at a rapid clip, even if die-hard Disney fans complained about the higher ticket prices. </p><p>\n  \"He's done well because he's able to make those unemotional decisions,\" said one colleague who worked in consumer products at the time. </p><p>\n  The reorganization of consumer products now seems like a prelude to the biggest stamp Mr. Chapek has put on Disney since taking over as CEO: an across-the-board separation between those who make Disney's movies and TV shows and those who decide whether they will premiere in theaters, on a TV network or on Disney+. </p><p>\n  As with his reorganization of consumer products, Mr. Chapek wants those who produce entertainment not to worry about how it is distributed. But that undoes years of business in Hollywood, where the same executives have typically overseen both storytelling and the allocation of production and marketing budgets. Similar restructurings at AT&amp;T Inc.'s Warner Bros. and other studios have forced a recalibration of Hollywood power centers, with agents, actors and directors not knowing who will ultimately decide how their movie or TV show is viewed -- or their salaries calculated. </p><p>\n  Mr. Iger has told associates he disagrees with some of Mr. Chapek's organizational choices, according to a person familiar with the matter. Insiders say the studio overhaul has also inflamed some of the worst aspects of Disney's political corporate culture, with fiefs like Marvel or Lucasfilm now having to lobby colleagues in other divisions for greater control of how their products are distributed. </p><p>\n  For Wall Street, the focus is on attracting and retaining Disney+ subscribers. One former executive with the streaming service said the next wave of growth will likely need to come largely from overseas audiences, since the service gained U.S. subscribers more quickly in its first few months than initial projections had anticipated. Disney+ had 95 million subscribers as of early January. Moving \"Mulan\" and other would-be theatrical releases like \"Hamilton\" to the service have provided subscription boosts, this person added. </p><p>\n  Mr. Chapek and his team have announced dozens of new shows and movies designed to attract and retain subscribers. In many ways, it is a programming slate that looks a lot like his direct-to-DVD days -- even once again turning to Tinker Bell for a new take on \"Peter Pan.\" </p><p>\n  For Mr. Vince, the \"Air Bud\" producer, the strategy comes as little surprise. The two men caught up shortly before Mr. Chapek was named CEO. Mr. Chapek wasn't involved in Disney+ at the time, but he had a read on where the company was going, he told Mr. Vince. </p><p>\n  \"They're in the home-entertainment business and they don't know it yet,\" Mr. Chapek said. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Once Upon a Time </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Feb. 25, 2020: Mr. Chapek is named Disney CEO, ending a yearslong drama over who would succeed Robert Iger. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  March 12: Walt Disney World and Disneyland close, along with a majority of U.S. movie theaters. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  March 30: Dozens of senior Disney executives, including Mr. Chapek, take pay cuts. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  April 20: More than 100,000 Disney employees are furloughed. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  July 3: A movie version of \"Hamilton\" premieres on Disney+. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  July 11: Disney World, in Orlando, Fla., reopens at reduced capacity.
