  "text": "<p>In January, Netflix announced that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/187e8f52-81f1-40bb-97bb-89c579581742\"><em>Bridgerton</em></a>, its flouncy Regency romance, had become its most-watched original series, with 82m views in the first 28 days.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a rare disclosure. The aim was to inspire<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc4849bc-a38c-480b-b268-f80e8b73a025\"> confidence </a>that the company's strategy of signing expensive deals with producers such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eee04462-08a7-432f-a5ff-441044d086eb\">Shonda Rhimes</a> was paying off.&#xa0;But metrics from one data start-up suggest flesh-eating giants garnered more attention than <em>Bridgerton's</em> tight-breeched beaux.</p> <p>Box office figures measure movie releases and Nielsen ratings cover TV shows. Streaming services only release selected viewership numbers. Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Netflix are keen to avoid disclosing information that might be useful to competitors. Judging which of their shows have been hits or misses is therefore difficult. </p> <p>Comparisons are made more complicated by the fact Netflix changed its viewership metric in 2019. Instead of only counting shows after users watch 70 per cent or more, the company now counts any show that has been watched for just two minutes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Without comprehensive streaming figures, investors are left to rely on user numbers instead. Netflix subscribers have grown from 22m in 2011 to 203.6m at the end of last year. Disney+ has passed 100m less than two years after launch.&#xa0;</p> <p>More granular information would be useful for producers and investors. The job of providing estimates falls to external organisations. Ratings giant Nielsen began reporting viewership for streaming services last summer, measured by total minutes watched. It says procedural series <em>Criminal Minds</em> was the most-viewed show on Netflix in the last week of January, watched for 984m minutes, versus 936m for <em>Bridgerton</em>. But Nielsen only tracks views through TV sets — missing other screens used for streaming services. Netflix has disparaged its data as not reflecting real viewing figures.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Start-up Parrot Analytics offers another metric: audience <a href=\"https://www.parrotanalytics.com/measurement\">attention measurement</a>. It claims that this captures a wider data set. Based in LA, it produces a daily leaderboard of TV shows it says have captured the most audience attention by tracking Google searches, fan sites and even numbers of pirate downloads. It plans to release a version for movies.&#xa0;</p> <p>According to Parrot Analytics, the most popular show in the US at the end of January was not <em>Bridgerton</em> but <em>Attack on Titan</em>. Instead of producing an estimate for viewing minutes, Parrot compares how popular shows are to the average. The sci fi anime captured 66 times more attention than the average series. <em>Bridgerton</em> did not even make it into the top 10. </p><p>Source:  2021 'Streaming: how to spot stealth Bridgertons' FT.com 14 March.
