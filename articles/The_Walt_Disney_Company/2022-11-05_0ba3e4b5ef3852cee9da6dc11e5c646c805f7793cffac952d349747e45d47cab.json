  "text": "<p>\n  If you build it, they will come -- that's always been true for baseball fields and it is starting to feel like an apt motto for Lego A/S, which celebrated its 90th birthday on Aug. 10. Based in Billund, Denmark, the company remains the largest toy manufacturer in the world. But it now also produces videogames, television shows, movies, apparel and even theme parks. </p><p>\n  To mark the anniversary and equip you with conversational fodder that will divert children (and children-at-heart), we've assembled some surprising facts and anecdotes from the brand's past and present lives. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Backwards Compatibility </p><p>\n  What do \"The Wire\" and Lego have in common? All the pieces matter. Every hard plastic Lego brick can connect to another, regardless of whether it was made 60 minutes ago or 60 years ago. It's what second-generation Lego owner Godtfred Kirk Christiansen called the \"Lego System in Play,\" after reorienting the company around its still relatively new stackable plastic bricks in the 1950s. This was a big shift. Earlier Lego releases were more conventional toys, like a handsome wooden duck. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Keep Rollin' Rollin' </p><p>\n  In 2012, the Guinness World Records book identified Lego as the world's largest tire manufacturer. That year the company churned out roughly 381 million tires. Lego staff historian Signe Wise said the number in 2022 is much higher, clocking in around 700 million tires for the year. That's far more than rubber-burning rivals like Michelin and Bridgestone (who hold the second- and third-place titles as of 2021) produce. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  IP Everywhere </p><p>\n  Marvel, DC Comics and \"Harry Potter\" do not just dominate pop culture, they also provide plenty of characters and environments for co-branded Lego sets. The first of these came in 1998, when Lego partnered with Lucasfilm in the lead up to \"Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.\" Some older pieces might resemble iconic products -- like some cars from the 1950s that look a lot like iconic Volkswagen vehicles -- but these weren't official Lego \"branded products,\" according to Ms. Wise. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Lego as Lifestyle </p><p>\n  Die-hard adult fans of Lego (who call themselves \"AFOLs\") will tell you that collecting and building sets is a lifestyle in and of itself. But there are plenty of Lego home and \"lifestyle\" goods too. Target partnered with Lego last fall for a collection that included a range of gear, like a Lego-piece-shaped box with a handle, color-blocked fleeces and even dog leashes. See also: the \"Botanical Collection,\" which features buildable bonsai trees and bouquets, no green thumb required. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The First Lady of Lego </p><p>\n  It is no easy feat to become a Lego Master Builder, the people who build massive displays and run workshops for young visitors to Legoland parks. There are only 33 in the U.S. And until recently, none of them at Legoland New York, located in Goshen, were women. That changed last April, with the hiring of Danielle Ross. Her day-to-day responsibilities vary, but they typically involve both maintaining existing builds and creating new ones. Her broader focus is Lego's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts: She said she's trying to create Minilanders (oversize versions of Minifigs, the technical term for Lego characters) that depict many types of people, \"so that anyone can see themselves\" at the amusement park. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  If You Can Dream It . . . </p><p>\n  Many have tried re-creating the sets from their favorite TV show in Lego. But what if one could make money doing such things? Enter Lego Ideas: a Kickstarter-like program that lets people submit detailed photos of anything they've built for review by the Lego community. If 10,000 people choose to \"support\" the design (no monetary investment required), Lego will review it. If the design makes it to market, the original creator gets a cut of the profits. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  They're Just Like Us </p><p>\n  \"I grew up making Lego when I was eight, nine years old, and actually I continue it,\" superstar athlete David Beckham told Jimmy Fallon during a \"Tonight Show\" appearance in late February 2020. \"It calms me,\" he added. Mr. Beckham is one of many celebrities (see: Britney Spears, Daniel Radcliffe and Anna Kendrick) who tote their Lego bona fides in public. Yet their fandom pales in comparison to that of Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. Mr. Turner commissioned a 100,000-piece statue of himself as Darth Vader from Black Lego artist Ekow Nimako, who specializes in creating Lego art and sculptures through the lens of Afrofuturism. </p><p></p>",
