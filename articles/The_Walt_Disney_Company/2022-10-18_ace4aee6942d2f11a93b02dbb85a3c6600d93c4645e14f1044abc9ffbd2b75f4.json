  "title": "Netflix Seeks to Improve Frequency of Visits  ----  By Sarah Krouse and Jessica Toonkel",
  "text": "<p>    Netflix Inc. earlier this year saw a worrying signal in its data: Users were coming to the streaming service less often, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The company, which tracks how many days over a four-week period its members watch content on the service, was concerned that the decline in visits would make it more likely that customers would cancel their subscriptions, the people said. </p><p>   Following that finding, co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings called on staff to find ways to make subscribers visit the platform more frequently, particularly as viewers re-establish their commuting, travel and entertainment habits after the worst of the pandemic, they said. </p><p>   The mission to improve visit frequency is part of a effort by the company to better assess the value of content that sits somewhere between a smash hit and a flop, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Over the past two years, that overarching effort included measuring whether a specific program is deemed \"sticky\" -- if it was watched for at least 75 minutes over the course of 28 days -- and giving users more tools to identify content they really like, such as a double thumbs-up, people familiar with the effort said. Now, the company is looking more closely at stickiness in concert with how frequently members return to the service. </p><p>   Netflix declined to comment. </p><p>   The company's growing emphasis on such metrics for making programming decisions comes as Netflix has lost subscribers for two consecutive quarters, something that had never happened before in the streaming pioneer's history. Netflix has told investors it expects to add one million subscribers in the third quarter. It is scheduled to report results for the period on Tuesday afternoon. </p><p>   Netflix's shares are down about 60% so far this year. </p><p>   Adding more urgency to Netflix's efforts to have customers spend more time on its platform is the November launch of its first ad-supported tier, given that the revenue the company can expect to generate from ads will depend on how many people see them. </p><p>   Netflix experienced a large influx of new customers in the early days of the pandemic, when lockdowns left many people with more time to watch shows such as \"Tiger King.\" That trend waned as life started getting back to normal, Netflix raised its prices in the U.S. this year and upstart streaming rivals including Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max expanded their subscriber bases. </p><p>   \"There are just way more places to put my eyeballs and my dollars,\" said Evan Shapiro, a producer and adjunct media professor at Fordham University and New York University. </p><p>   Netflix, whose executives used to boast that the service only competed with sleep, now finds itself competing not only with streaming rivals, but with apps such as TikTok and YouTube that are hugely popular among young people. </p><p>   An internal brand health tracker that regularly surveys consumers about their perception of Netflix showed that young and diverse audiences' view of the company was flagging, people familiar with that finding said. </p><p>   Netflix ascended to the dominant spot in streaming with the help of its focus on finding new ways to measure success. One way Netflix has tried to stoke more regular and prolonged viewing over the past year is by helping subscribers give more feedback on their preferences and diversifying the recommendations they receive. </p><p></p>",
