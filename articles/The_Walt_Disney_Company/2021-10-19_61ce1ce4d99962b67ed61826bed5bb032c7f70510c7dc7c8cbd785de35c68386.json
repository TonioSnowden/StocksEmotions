  "text": "<p>Typically, the summer months tend to be slower in regards to subscriber additions. In last year's third quarter, Netflix added 2.2 million subscribers, just missing expectations. At that time, the company said the big gains in subscribers it had seen during the Covid-19 lockdown were beginning to wane.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are you watching more or less Netflix these days? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In recent weeks, Netflix has benefited from the success of \"Squid Game,\" the South Korean dystopian drama that made its debut last month and quickly became a global phenomenon. The series has gone viral with social platforms like TikTok showing videos of people replicating the children's games, while online retailers are rushing to sell \"Squid Game\" Halloween costumes.</p><p>In its letter to investors, Netflix said \"Squid Game\" has become its most popular show ever, with 142 million households sampling the title. It is the No. 1 program in 94 countries, it said.</p><p>Movies that performed well include \"Sweet Girl\" starring Jason Momoa and \"The Kissing Booth 3,\" the company said.</p><p>Netflix is also projecting a strong fourth quarter in terms of content with the return of the dark drama \"You\" and \"Cobra Kai,\" the popular series that is a sequel of sorts to the \"Karate Kid\" movie franchise. The major movies Netflix will drop in the coming months include \"Red Notice\" with Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot and the Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence film \"Don't Look Up.\"</p><p>The Asia Pacific region was among the company's strongest in terms of new members, responsible for half of the additions in the quarter, adding 2.2 million subscribers to the total tally.</p><p>In the U.S. and Canada, Netflix ended the third quarter with 74.02 million subscribers, an improvement of 73,000 from the end of the second quarter. Competition in the U.S. in particular has grown rapidly over the past few years as rivals including Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+, AT&amp;T Inc.'s HBOMax and Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video continue to make inroads.</p><p>Netflix earlier this year said it would make its own videogames, part of an effort to expand into new revenue streams. The company said the games would be made for mobile devices, and some of them may feature characters from Netflix shows and movies. The games will be included at no extra cost to Netflix members.</p><p>\"We've begun testing our games offering in select countries,\" Netflix said in its shareholder letter. \"It remains very early days for this initiative and, like other content categories we've expanded into, we plan to try different types of games, learn from our members and improve our game library.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, Netflix also teamed up with Walmart Inc. to create a digital storefront on the retailer's website that will sell merchandise tied to hit shows such as \"Stranger Things\" and \"Squid Game.\" The deal with Walmart creates a dedicated area of Walmart.com for Netflix merchandise, the Netflix, marking the first such online storefront that Netflix has created with a national retailer.</p><p>The Los Gatos, Calif.-based streaming company said revenue rose 16% to $7.48 billion, in line with Wall Street's expectations.</p><p>Netflix's profit increased to $1.45 billion, or $3.19 a share, from $790 million, or $1.74 a share, in the same period last year. Its bottom-line topped analysts' earnings estimates of $2.57 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>For the current holiday quarter, Netflix projects 8.5 million new subscribers, $7.71 billion in revenue and earnings of 80 cents a share.</p><p>Write to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com and Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Adds More Users Than It Predicted, Boosted by 'Squid Game'</p>",
