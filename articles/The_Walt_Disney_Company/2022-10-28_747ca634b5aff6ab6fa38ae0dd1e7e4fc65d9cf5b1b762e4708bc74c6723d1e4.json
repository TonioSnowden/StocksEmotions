  "title": "How Maya Rudolph Became the Queen of Comedy; Audiences first fell in love with Rudolph—WSJ.'s 2022 Comedy Innovator—on 'Saturday Night Live.' Two decades later, the writer, producer and Emmy-winning actor continues to bring her signature sense of humor to television, film and beyond.",
  "text": "<p>Rudolph is in the converted garage of her production company's Los Angeles headquarters, wearing a black empire-waist maxi dress, her uniform of leisure. She remembers her first appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman in 2009. \"He said my name wrong, and I just sat there, like, I grew up my whole life in love with you. And now my heart is broken. And I'm sitting here embarrassed and humiliated,\" she reflects. \"I didn't know how to handle it. I didn't know how to come up with something funny to say. My public persona muscle wasn't strong yet.\" Over time, she adjusted. \"I've definitely gotten much better. When I'm uncomfortable, I try to be funny.\"</p><p>In June, she took on her latest television project, co-executive-producing and starring in the Apple TV+ series Loot as Molly Novak, a divorcée who discovers philanthropy after winning an $87 billion settlement from her cheating tech husband, played by Adam Scott. During an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers, Rudolph talked about filming scenes at the Bel Air megamansion The One, a 105,000-square-foot palace with 42 bathrooms and several pools, including one right off of a bedroom, which, as Rudolph told Meyers, is useful if \"you wanna watch your lover swim.\"</p><p>Rudolph has a natural curiosity and playfulness that makes her characters feel sincere. That impulse toward empathy has informed her work in comedies like Bridesmaids and as one of Saturday Night Live's most-beloved cast members for seven seasons. She won her second Emmy last year for an affable guest portrayal as Vice President Kamala Harris. Now a Hollywood fixture, Rudolph has become choosier about roles and collaborators, many of whom are friends. In the macabre 2018 Amazon drama Forever, she played a suburban wife alongside SNL alumnus Fred Armisen. In Nick Kroll's adolescent Netflix series Big Mouth, she voices the giddy Hormone Monstress, Connie. (Season 6 premiered in October.) In November, Rudolph stars opposite Amy Adams's princess Giselle as the evil queen Malvina in the Enchanted sequel, Disenchanted.</p><p>Rudolph's sense of mirth works well for a Disney villain. \"People just love Maya, and you need to love this villain,\" says Adams. \"She's able to bring so much joy and energy to the set but also stay extraordinarily grounded in the truth of any moment, even when playing these larger-than-life comedic beasts.\"</p><p>The pandemic has made Rudolph, like many others, focus more on her physical and mental well-being. For her 50th birthday in June, she vacationed in Europe with her partner of over 20 years, director Paul Thomas Anderson, and their four kids. It was her first break in a while. The pursuit of balance is an existential cliché, and Rudolph has found it to be deceptive. \"What is this fake thing we think exists about balance?\" she says, steadying a Cobb salad she got for lunch on one palm. \"I mean, meditation is helpful to me, but did I do it this morning? No.\" She smiles. \"And that's OK.\"</p><p>Lately she's been having lucid revelations, like the fact that in years of performing physical roles on SNL, she never did warm-ups. \"I'm like, Why didn't I ever stretch before doing things like that? I could have really hurt myself!\" she exclaims. \"Little things add up, and when you turn 50, you start to think, Holy shit! I've been here for 50 years. Like, OK, I'm really examining my life right now. What needs to happen?\"</p><p>A few years ago, Rudolph envisioned her ideal workspace as a happy place with a calming energy. She wanted peacefulness in her life and figured her office should be an actual home. \"My dream was to have a kitchen and someone cooking in here all the time,\" she says, rummaging for utensils in the back office. \"That hasn't happened yet. But isn't that comforting?\"</p><p>Rudolph formed Animal Pictures in 2018 with longtime friends: actor Natasha Lyonne (they met in Rudolph's first year at SNL) and producer Danielle Renfrew Behrens (they've known each other since kindergarten). In June, the company inked a first-look deal with Apple TV+ and recently completed projects like Lyonne's Peacock mystery series Poker Face, and Sirens, a documentary about a female hair-metal band. The Animal Pictures headquarters is a modest ranch house in Studio City, with an open-concept living room featuring a built-in bookcase filled with duplicate copies of biographies like Julia Blackburn's With Billie.</p><p>As a rule, Rudolph loves the energy of working with friends, but the sketch-comedy cycle became exhausting. She started to prioritize rest. \"Believe me, I am not a Pollyanna who's like, I smile all day, every day. I get stressed out, I get pissed off, but I learned I could make a choice for myself, and it's liberating,\" she says of valuing downtime. \"Maybe people who've worked as long as I have make other choices and have nicer cars. I don't know, but it's so important for me to [try to] have that balance.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, Lyonne took over the company's back office to edit for season 2 of her Netflix drama Russian Doll, which Animal Pictures co-produced. The back wall doubles as a whiteboard, still smeared with the grime of bygone notes. Rudolph mentions that the writers' room for Loot met in the office recently to develop season 2. Although show creators Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard (who also created Forever) had Jeff Bezos's divorce in mind when crafting Loot, Rudolph's inspiration for her character, Molly, was looser. The commentary about wealth is cheeky, not searing.</p><p>\"The show was never about raking any one person over the coals. I've never personally been interested in scathing comedy,\" says Rudolph. \"It doesn't sit right in my body, and it doesn't work for me, and I learned through experience that I'm funnier when I find something funny. When I'm not feeling that, it feels like a lie.\" By the series' end, Molly makes a grand, charitable gesture. Similarly, in September, Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, revealed that he'd donated the entire company, with future profits going to fight climate change. Rudolph says, \"We were all texting each other, going, 'Do you think he watched the show?!' \"</p><p>Only a likable star could offset the opulence on Loot with levity. (During the divorce proceedings, Molly discovers she owns both an alpaca farm and an amusement park.) \"The world of billionaires sounds like magic to me, and I've always loved an element of magic in anything I do,\" says Rudolph. The show requires her to play an exaggerated version of herself at an intersection of fame and money that's foreign to someone who doesn't consider herself a celebrity. \"I know I'm a working actor and people know who I am, but I don't feel like a celebrity, because that word means something else today to me,\" says Rudolph. \"There are a lot of different types of celebrities these days and a lot of self-made celebrities where people are famous for being famous, and that isn't what I do.\"</p><p>On days when she's not filming, you will \"never, never\" see her in full makeup. After we speak, she offers me an orange and packs my leftover salad into a spare paper bag like a lunch box, dropping in plastic cutlery. When Lyonne was preparing to host Saturday Night Live for the first time in May, she and Rudolph hopped on a FaceTime call. \"She was walking around in the bathroom, and I'm pretty sure she was, like, topless,\" says Lyonne, laughing at the memory. \"She was like, 'You need to tell little Natasha that big Natasha is here, and she's going to take care of little Natasha and that you've got her, and you know how to show up for her now.' \"</p><p>Lyonne attributes the easiness to a simple trait. \"She essentially has self-respect, which I think so many of us are willing to dispose of too easily in the race to win at life,\" says Lyonne. \"Maya very much has that energy of, No, this is life. So we better get a good sofa that we can actually sit on and relax and watch movies, so we stay in an inspired, happy place where we want to continue to create rather than this harsh metal bench with the wind blowing and an overcoat pulled tight.\"</p><p>Early in her career, Rudolph wondered the same thing others did: What is it about Maya Rudolph? \"I remember saying to someone, 'What am I to you? What's my brand?' Because I don't know what it is,\" she says. \"Do I have a brand? Like, what is it?\"</p><p>The average TV viewer might not realize that Rudolph is the daughter of two artists: soul legend Minnie Riperton and producer-songwriter Richard Rudolph. The couple raised Maya and her older brother, Marc, in Los Angeles before Riperton died of breast cancer when Maya was 6 years old.</p><p>Naturally, Maya became a musical entertainer. She was also a style-obsessed Vogue magazine hoarder. Around eighth grade, she discovered thrift shops, and at 14, she worked at a store on Melrose, after saying she was 16 to get the job. For her high school senior project, Maya put on a fashion show and used a song by designer Jean Paul Gaultier (who briefly dabbled in dance music in the '80s), and she once told her father she wanted to start an affordable clothing line. (She studied fashion one summer in Paris.)</p><p>She also studied photography at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and knew she wanted to act but didn't want to be \"a boring-ass person who grew up in L.A. and stayed in L.A.,\" Rudolph says. \"I wanted to feel more well-rounded, but I was probably a little scared to go far.\"</p><p>Rudolph's dad was adamant about her finding a job. Maya wanted a cool one. To pay rent, she worked as a wardrobe assistant for commercials and music videos tasked with finding, for example, \"outfits for the type of people who would be on Three's Company.\" She once plucked costumes for kids cosplaying as rappers in a posthumous Notorious B.I.G. video.</p><p>After a stint as a keyboardist in the rock band the Rentals, Rudolph joined L.A. improv troupe The Groundlings. One of her teachers, actor Mindy Sterling, told her, \"You sing. It's part of you,\" which inspired Rudolph to continue incorporating it into her act. For Disenchanted, she sings a challenging duet with co-star Adams. \"I'm always hard on myself about singing. I put the bar way too high, and the song they wrote for us was much higher than I'm used to,\" says Rudolph. \"I was scared I wouldn't be able to pull it off, so I worked really hard with our musical director. And when I sang it, it was such a personal accomplishment.\"</p><p>She uses her mother's staggering five-octave vocal range as a measure. \"I don't know because I can't ask her, but with her, it's like, that was there from the beginning,\" says Rudolph of her mom's musicality. \"What's strange about my voice is I can sing like other people. I just don't really know what my voice sounds like. I had to accept that I'm a bit more of an alto, and that's OK. I can't sing everything.\"</p><p>At first, she took a passive approach to acting. \"I thought being an actor was waiting to be hired by people, which is ironic for somebody like me, who looked like no one I saw on any screen at any point in my life,\" says Rudolph, citing the actor she often mentions as a muse. \"I like to say Lisa Bonet because I knew she was mixed [race]. I didn't look like Lisa Bonet. But it was the closest I got. Because I hadn't established who I was for myself, I didn't know what my go-to thing was. I had to tell people who I was. They couldn't figure me out. They weren't thinking about me. No one's thinking about you. Only you are thinking about you.\"</p><p>Rudolph joined SNL when she was 27 and was stumbling toward finding her voice. She would sometimes write a piece she thought was funny, and it wouldn't be chosen. \"And then there were times I'd be handed something, and I would feel like, I don't know how to do this,\" she says. In time, she found her cadence and implemented it into her work. \"I started to understand myself better, \" she says.</p><p>As an actor, Rudolph leans toward being outrageous but jovial and always redeeming. \"There's nothing worse than watching a show and hating somebody. I mean, it exists,\" she says. \"You know, people love Succession. Like, 'Oh, my God, they're such assholes!' It's such an incredible show, but I think there is something to human nature in that we want to empathize. And that's why we watch other human beings in stories. We want to connect somehow to ourselves.\"</p><p>Lyonne also sees a rhythm in Rudolph's approach. \"I often think it's because of a musicality that's in her organically and walks hand-in-hand with the comedy,\" says Lyonne. \"Part of the skill of improvisation is that their minds are sort of wired for very big thoughts and also know how to have the joy of plucking it very quickly and distilling it to something that's at its most absurdist.\"</p><p>Rudolph doesn't always understand why her comedy lands. All she knows is that she keeps creating until it feels right. \"There isn't always an answer. 'Why did Bridesmaids click?' has been the story ever since it came out,\" Rudolph says with a shrug. \"We were all so predisposed to making things we thought were funny but not necessarily having them resonate with other people in the way that that movie did. It proves there isn't one way to do something, and you never know how people will respond. So the more you do the thing you do, the better you get at it.\" So much of the process is out of her hands, and that's OK, she says. \"It's never always up to you.\"</p><p>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p><p>Maya Rudolph said she didn't have a good time on the first talk show she did. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said she was referring to an interview on The Late Show With David Letterman.
