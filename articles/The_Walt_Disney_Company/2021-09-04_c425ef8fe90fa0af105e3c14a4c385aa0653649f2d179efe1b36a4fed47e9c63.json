  "text": "<p>   Aaron Klein's op-ed \"Public Colleges Reach Across State Lines for a Tuition Windfall\" (Aug. 31) brings back memories of the aughts, when the Pennsylvania legislature continued cutting its allocation to Penn State University while demanding that tuition remain affordable for Pennsylvania residents. </p><p>   In a discussion with deans, Penn State's then-president said that when he arose each morning, he faced the east and thanked God for New Jersey. Looks like such prayers are still happening across the country. </p><p>   Em. Prof. Diane M. Disney </p><p>   Pennsylvania State University </p><p>   West Chester, Pa. </p><p></p>",
