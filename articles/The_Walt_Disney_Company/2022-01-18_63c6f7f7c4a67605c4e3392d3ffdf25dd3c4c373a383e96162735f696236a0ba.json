  "title": "Technology:  Jeffrey Katzenberg Taps  Investor to Spot Tech Deals  ----  By Erich Schwartzel",
  "text": "<p>   When he was growing up in Los Angeles, Anthony Saleh said he found entrepreneurial inspiration in the VHS cassettes of Walt Disney Co. classics such as \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Aladdin.\" After receiving the tapes for his birthday, he would rent them out to friends for 25 cents a night. </p><p>   At the time, Mr. Saleh gave no thought to the company behind those movies, or the executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg, then largely responsible for their production throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Yet more than 25 years later, it is Mr. Saleh whom Mr. Katzenberg is turning to for help plotting a course out of the rubble formed when his first post-Hollywood venture, Quibi, imploded. </p><p>   Mr. Saleh, 35 years old, has been Mr. Katzenberg's point of entry to the early-stage technology companies the mogul is evaluating far outside the Hollywood bubble, both men said. After managing music and investments for rapper Nas for more than a decade, Mr. Saleh is overseeing early-seed investing at Mr. Katzenberg's WndrCo, plugging the company into a lucrative but crowded venture-capital field following its high-profile failure with Quibi, the mobile-video app that shut after less than a year. </p><p>   \"Jeffrey can open any door, but he's never done tech investing,\" said Sujay Jaswa, a managing partner at WndrCo who met Mr. Saleh when he and Nas invested in Dropbox Inc., where Mr. Jaswa was chief financial officer. </p><p>   Mr. Saleh's investments provide a road map for where WndrCo is focused after Quibi's demise, and so far have included Dapper Labs, the creator of NBA Top Shot, the digital collectibles company that has successfully ridden the cryptocurrency wave. Mr. Saleh's initial $150,000 investment on behalf of WndrCo is valued at roughly $11 million. </p><p>   Mr. Saleh says his background in music, where he had to manage fans and their expectations, has helped him guide tech firms that want a similar relationship with users. </p><p>   \"I apply my understanding to other industries, because for technology to be adopted by the masses, these companies need to understand how consumers think,\" said Mr. Saleh. </p><p>   After an initial $15 million investing portfolio, Mr. Saleh has started raising money for a new fund worth $100 million, according to a WndrCo filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. </p><p>   Mr. Saleh's investments function as a farm system for WndrCo at large, which can take larger stakes or potentially acquire the companies down the road, said WndrCo leadership. Quibi's failure was one reason Mr. Saleh has dropped the pursuit of media investments, he said. </p><p>   \"I had a supercalifragilistic down,\" is how Mr. Katzenberg, 71 years old, put the experience of Quibi's failure. </p><p>   The short-form video app premiered in April 2020 to much fanfare, having raised nearly $2 billion and recruited stars such as Liam Hemsworth and Reese Witherspoon to contribute to shows for the service. But subscriptions never caught on and the entire venture folded after eight months. </p><p>   Mr. Saleh and his team are capitalizing on a surge of interest in early-stage investments globally, in part spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, which boosted sectors that benefit from lockdowns and an increased reliance on technology. </p><p>   Colleagues describe Mr. Saleh as WndrCo's barometer of what is catching on in the broader culture. Last year, Mr. Saleh pushed one of WndrCo's high-profile investments, the cybersecurity company Aura, toward an endorsement deal with the National Basketball Association team the Minnesota Timberwolves, which put the Aura name on the team jerseys. </p><p>   \"He understands consumer behavior not by reading market research,\" said Mr. Jaswa of Mr. Saleh. \"He's just in it.\" </p><p>   Dapper Labs Chief Executive Roham Gharegozlou added that entrepreneurs today often want to be in touch with their audiences on a more cultural level, as opposed to \"just software developers who don't want to meet their customers.\" </p><p>   It is a shift in tech thinking that mirrors the entertainment industry's embrace of fandom, said Mr. Gharegozlou. </p><p></p>",
