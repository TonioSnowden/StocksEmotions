  "title": "Disney's Head of Corporate Affairs Leaves Company Amid Dust-Up With Florida; Geoff Morrell departs after less than four months on the job, saying 'it is not the right fit'",
  "text": "<p>As the leader of corporate affairs, Mr. Morrell oversaw corporate communications, global public policy and government relations.</p><p>In a message to his staff, Mr. Morrell wrote, \"After three months in this new role, it has become clear to me that for a number of reasons it is not the right fit.\" He wished the company and Mr. Chapek \"the very best.\"</p><p>Mr. Chapek in an email Friday to Disney executives wrote that Mr. Morrell was leaving to pursue other opportunities.</p><p>Disney faced backlash from fans and some employees over its silence to the state's Parental Rights in Education bill, which Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, signed into law in March. The law bars classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation through third grade and limits it for older students to material that is \"age-appropriate.\"</p><p>Disney later reversed course. After it passed, the company pledged to push for its repeal and to fight similar bills in other states.</p><p>The conflict escalated this month after Mr. DeSantis pushed the Florida legislature to pass a bill that would strip Disney of a special tax districtthat has allowed it to self-govern the land that houses Walt Disney World's theme parks, hotels, resorts and other attractions. Mr. DeSantis signed the bill into law on April 22.</p><p>Before signing the bill, Mr. DeSantis criticized Disney's decision to oppose the law, which he said liberals and the media distorted. \"You're a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you're going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state?\" he said. \"We view that as a provocation and we're going to fight back against that.\"</p><p>Born and raised in Washington, D.C., Mr. Morrell joined Disney after an 11-year stint in communications and external affairs at U.K. energy giant BP PLC. From 2007 to 2011, he was Pentagon press secretary at the U.S. Department of Defense. Earlier in his career, he was a television news reporter in Chicago.</p><p>He hadn't previously led communications at a consumer-facing company of Disney's size and influence.</p><p>In early March, Mr. Morrell posted a tweet revealing the opening date of a new \"Guardians of the Galaxy\"-themed park ride, and linked to a parody Twitter account.</p><p>The opening dates of Disney rides are closely guarded secrets. Mr. Morrell later deleted the tweet.</p><p>In his email, Mr. Chapek said communications efforts will fall under Kristina Schake, who was named executive vice president of global communications earlier this month. General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez will lead government relations and global public policy, while Jenny Cohen, executive vice president of corporate social responsibility, will now report to Mr. Chapek.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney's Head of Corporate Affairs Leaves Company Amid Dust-Up With Florida</p>",
