  "text": "<p>Oneworld, 294 pages, $35</p><p>When I type the word \"flower\" into my iPhone's emoji engine, the algorithm presents me with a red rose. Since at least the early centuries B.C., around the first appearance of a poem once attributed to Sappho, the rose has been known as \"The Queen of Flowers.\" How, among the garden's many worthies, did it earn such pride of place?</p><p>Like the apple, the rose has become a logo -- in contemporary culture, for romantic love. The rose that TV's bachelor or bachelorette hands out, the bud magically preserved in Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- these perfect blooms represent a dense bouquet of ideas and ideals. Bette Midler doesn't sing songs about tulips.</p><p>But romance is not the only meaning of a rose. As art historian and devoted amateur gardener Simon Morley notes in \"By Any Other Name: A Cultural History of the Rose,\" over the past two millennia and more the rose has been a symbol of many things, often irreconcilable: of mortality, of immortality, of virginity, of decadent dissolution. (\"Rose, oh pure contradiction,\" wrote Rainer Maria Rilke.)</p><p>This is to say nothing of the \"language of flowers\" developed in the Victorian era: A yellow rose stood for friendship, white for innocence and purity; only a single red rose served as a declaration of love. In contemporary commercial culture, Mr. Morley notes, roses have become all-purpose accompaniments for major life events -- graduations, weddings, funerals -- and births. A rose, he writes, \"may be one of the very first things a newborn baby sees, so common a gift is it for new mothers.\"</p><p>Poets have been preoccupied with roses for centuries, from Petrarch (\"Two fresh roses / gathered from paradise . . .\") to Dorothy Parker (\"Why is it no one ever sent me yet / One perfect limousine, do you suppose?\"). But actual, tangible roses only achieved omnipresence in everyday lives during the 20th century. The bushes from which Petrarch picked bloomed only briefly each year, after all; rose-time was a special occasion. (Willa Cather: \"Oh, this is the joy of the rose; / That it blows, / And goes.\") Mr. Morley's book is, in part, the story of how humans came to raise roses so consistently and abundantly that we demand them even in freezing February. First, though, \"By Any Other Name\" recounts the love affair with a flower that drove us to want to do that in the first place.</p><p>To sort through more than two millennia of cultural accumulation, the author neatly separates his work into chapters with subtitles like \"Love and the Rose,\" \"Death and the Rose,\" \"Painted Roses,\" \"The Rose Business.\" (He mentions, but does not devote a chapter to, the role of the \"political\" rose -- from the white rose of York in 15th-century England to the red rose of socialism.) \"By Any Other Name\" peeks east in its early chapters -- at the rose in the poetry of the Sufis, at its close association with Muhammad, and at the Islamic-style gardens that would influence later conceptions of formal rose gardens. The author observes that there is archaeological evidence, from as much as 13,700 years ago, of bodies buried atop beds of roses on Israel's Mount Carmel. But, for the most part, Mr. Morley's is a history of the \"Western\" rose -- which is to say, the rose of Rome.</p><p>The ancient Romans had a special devotion to the goddess Venus. Like the Greek Aphrodite, she was said to have been born from the Mediterranean; the sea foam had turned to white roses. Red roses received their color from her blood, spilled by a thorn as she chased Adonis. \"At the end of the Iliad,\" Mr. Morley notes, \"Aphrodite is described as using immortal rose oil to protect the body of Hector.\" The author ruminates on the similarity in English between the words \"rose\" (from Latin) and \"eros\" (from Greek), as well as the biological qualities of the rose that might have given rise to a close association with sensuality. One myth said that Bacchus, Venus's sometime lover, grew the first vine next to a rose bush. This is why Roman revelers decorated tables with roses, or wore them about their heads or necks.</p><p>The erotic rose of the Romans was, according to Mr. Morley, at first eschewed in the Christian era as a pagan symbol. Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria specifically inveighed against their contemporaries' fascination with the flower. But over time, in the author's words, \"a new Christian allegorical rose began to sprout\" many different spiritual associations -- with martyrdom, with the Sacred Heart of Christ, and, most especially, with the Virgin Mary. Mr. Morley recounts a litany of Mary's rose-related titles: She was \"the rose of heaven,\" the \"rose without thorns,\" the \"never-wilting rose,\" \"the Rosa Mystica.\" The most well-known Marian devotion remains the rosary. (In Middle English, the author explains, \"rosary\" simply meant \"rose garden.\")</p><p>The secular strain of symbolism never went away. Mr. Morley finds the old Pagan eroticism sublimated into chivalric iconography in the medieval poem \"The Romance of the Rose.\" And in Shakespeare and his Elizabethan contemporaries, rose imagery blossomed in full ripeness. (\"Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud,\" a French lord declares in \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" a line perhaps appropriate for Covid valentines.) In Mr. Morley's telling, at least, the Reforming Protestants, like their early Christian predecessors, seemed to suppress the cult of the rose, perhaps unnerved by its Papist associations.</p><p>It would flower again thanks to the \"pantheistic\" artistic and philosophical movement known as (what else?) Romanticism. According to Mr. Morley, the Romantics employed the rose not as a symbol of any particular concept but as an avatar of the natural world, foreign but intimate. \"The Rose as experienced by the Romantic,\" he writes, \"is therefore inward and passionate, fundamentally mysterious, dark and chthonic.\" The interplay of sacred and profane meanings is a theme in poets from Percy Bysshe Shelley to William Butler Yeats; he also traces it through decadent artists like Charles Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde.</p><p>At the same time, another set of 19th-century devotees was on the rise, this one horticultural. Empress Josephine's rose garden had brought together varieties from around the world, and gardeners in England and France obsessively pursued a project of crossing European \"ramblers,\" which bloomed just once a summer, with \"repeaters\" imported from China -- these flowers had the notable habit, called remontancy, of blooming repeatedly throughout the summer, not merely in proverbial May.</p><p>The result was known as the hybrid tea rose, a general classification including the qualities we associate with those in our Valentine's Day bouquets -- a \"high-centered,\" inverted-cup shape, with durable and deeply colored petals and a long stem. Today plants like these are produced in greenhouses year-round and efficiently shipped across the globe, even though, as Mr. Morley observes, \"most of the roses grown today, and pretty much all the roses we give as cut roses, are significantly different in appearance from all European roses in existence prior to this period.\"</p><p>The author entertains the idea that there is a sort of co-evolutionary operation at play -- the rose \"made\" itself attractive to humans in order to propagate as widely as possible. But putting together the cultural and horticultural threads of Mr. Morley's account produces a certain tragic irony. Is the rose of the Romans and Shakespeare and Shelley really the rose we know today? The bud that bloomed so beautifully and briefly created an obsession -- and in time an industry -- that may have fundamentally altered the flower. Is a rose still a rose still a rose?</p><p>Some of the mystery of what once made the rose fascinating can be resolved by reading closely through \"By Any Other Name\" -- or surveying the bouquets sold at the grocery store like broccoli -- and noticing what we're missing: A bud in a vase, or an emoji on a screen, cannot capture the scent that so delighted our ancestors. \"Ho, the rose breathes of love!\" says that supposed Sappho fragment, in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's translation. Mr. Morley, citing his title quotation, points out that when Juliet speaks of Romeo she says nothing about appearances but that \"a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\"</p><p>You can understand a bit of what she meant, standing in a rose garden in full burst, when a warm breeze rises. But, like the ancients, you'll probably have to wait deep into spring.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Propson is a books editor at the Journal.</p>",
