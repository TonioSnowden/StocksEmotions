  "text": "<p>   Netflix Inc. said subscriber growth for the first quarter was weaker than expected, a potential warning sign for the company as consumers in many countries start to emerge from pandemic-related lockdowns and as streaming competition increases. </p><p>   The company on Tuesday said it added another four million subscribers on a net basis globally between January and March, fewer than its forecast of six million. </p><p>   \"It's just a little wobbly right now,\" Netflix Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company's video call to discuss results. </p><p>   Netflix shares were 8.4% lower in after-hours trading. The stock is up nearly 26% over the last 12 months. </p><p>   The subscriber gain in the first quarter was far below the 15.8 million increase from a year earlier, when the spread of the coronavirus was first intensifying and people were homebound and binging on content. </p><p>   \"There's a boost in engagement that you get when people are in a lockdown situation,\" Netflix operations chief Gregory Peters said at an investor event last month. </p><p>   Many consumers who get vaccinated are venturing out of their homes more and shifting spending despite the lingering threat posed by coronavirus. Airlines are looking for a resurgence in summer travel. Movie theaters and other venues have reopened in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. Restaurants and hotels, both hard hit by pandemic-related closures and restrictions, have stepped up hiring. </p><p>   Netflix said in a letter to shareholders it believed subscriber \"growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays.\" </p><p>   The company's lower-than-expected growth comes as it faces its greatest competitive threats. Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+, which launched just about a year and a half ago, already has 100 million subscribers world-wide. Other rivals including AT&amp;T Inc.'s HBO Max, Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+ and Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video are spending heavily for content, driving up programming costs. </p><p>   Despite the crowded streaming marketplace, Netflix said its rivals didn't play a part in the company missing its estimates. </p><p>   \"There's no real change that we can detect in the competitive environment\" that would have affected the results, Mr. Hastings said. \"We really looked through all the data and we just can't see any difference.\" </p><p>   Netflix said it expects subscriber growth to pick up in the second half of the year, when some of its more successful shows return with fresh episodes, including \"The Witcher\" and \"You.\" Netflix projected it will spend more than $17 billion on content this year. </p><p>   \"A lot of the projects we hoped to get out earlier did get pushed,\" Netflix Co-Chief Executive and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said. </p><p>   In recent weeks, Netflix has also made moves to shore up its content through acquisitions and licensing deals. It struck a five-year deal valued at well over $1 billion with Sony Pictures Entertainment for streaming rights to the studio's theatrical releases starting in 2022. It also spent $440 million for the rights to make two sequels to the film \"Knives Out\" starring Daniel Craig. </p><p>   As part of the Sony pact, the two companies will also create original content for the streaming service. </p><p>   Netflix said it would commence a stock-buyback program this quarter, and has authorized up to $5 billion in buybacks. </p><p>   The company reported a quarterly profit of $1.71 billion, or $3.75 a share, compared with $542.2 million, or $1.19 a share, for the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $7.16 billion from $6.64 billion. </p><p>   Netflix had forecast $1.36 billion in net income and $7.13 billion in revenue for the period. </p><p>   For the first quarter, subscribers in markets overseas continued to drive growth. Netflix reported gaining 1.8 million new subscribers in the region that includes Europe and the Middle East and 1.4 million across Asia. </p><p>   Subscriptions in Latin America increased by 360,000 and in the U.S. and Canada by 450,000. </p><p></p>",
