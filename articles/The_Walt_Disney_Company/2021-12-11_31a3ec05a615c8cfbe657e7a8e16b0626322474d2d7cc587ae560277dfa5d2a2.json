  "text": "<p>   Ellie Sufi adopted a dog in the early months of the pandemic. Ms. Sufi, 27, who had been living alone in a studio in downtown Chicago, said that Enzo, her French bulldog, got her through the loneliness of 2020. In September, she wanted to spoil him a bit so she booked a staycation for the two of them at the Ambassador Chicago, where a new package aims to pamper not only human guests but also furry, four-legged ones. </p><p>   After a year of bonding at home with their animals, many pet owners are deciding to take their critters, especially their dogs, on the road. Several travel companies are paying attention to the trend, rolling out luxury amenities that take \"pet-friendly\" to new levels. Increasingly, the options for canines and other companions are five-star and priced to match. </p><p>   At the Ambassador, Enzo was greeted with a custom dog biscuit and dog toy. A photo of him, printed from his Instagram page, was waiting in the room along with food and water bowls. Ms. Sufi was given a map of pet-friendly restaurants. </p><p>   Six years ago, Las Ventanas al Paraiso, a Rosewood Resort in Los Cabos, added \"dog butlers,\" whose responsibilities include dog walking, poop scooping and canine massage. The offerings have ramped up each year, said Frederic Vidal, the resort's managing director. This year, for guests who celebrated Thanksgiving at the hotel with their dogs in tow, the holiday menu offered canine treats such as turkey jerky, wild rice and baby spinach. </p><p>   El Encanto, a Belmond Hotel, in Santa Barbara, Calif., also updated its dog-friendly offerings in 2020. Gourmet dog menus now list gluten-free options and seasonal fish for $15 a plate, as well as lavender-and-mint treats ($8). For stressed pups, you can order a Ruff Day, a herbal tea blend of camomile, ginger, echinacea and hawthorn berry ($5 a bowl). </p><p>   Down the coast, Jason Prendergast, executive chef of FIG at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel &amp; Bungalows in Santa Monica, Calif., uses similarly high-quality ingredients, including Niman Ranch beef, for pet morsels. At the London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills, the $22 London Pooch meal, with fresh chicken and brown rice, is surely a step up from the pup's usual chow, as are executive chef Anthony Keene's peanut butter treats. </p><p>   Dog-owning visitors staying at New York City's Crowne Plaza HY36 can partake in the Pets Getaway package that offers 33% off the pet fee (normally $75), two one-way MetroCards and a MetroCard chew toy. In Florida, the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort has added a vegan menu to its pet offerings for animals who don't eat animals, while the W Fort Lauderdale offers a bottle of nonalcoholic Dog Pawrignon for Rover. </p><p>   Hilton's extended-stay properties now dispense tips for pet wellness and behavioral health. In spring 2021, the Hard Rock Hotel group introduced the Unleashed Pet Program at some of its properties including ones in Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The company also plans to offer it at the New York location, which is slated to open in April. Participating guests get a \"sWag bag\" with a chew toy, a velvet memory-foam dog bed for their stay and a customized Spotify playlist with songs such as \"Who Let the Dogs Out.\" </p><p>   Not relaxing enough for you or your pooch? The Lygon Arms, a historic hotel in England's Cotswolds, paired up with a local groomer to offer a spa day for pet and owner for about $218 a package. Both humans and dogs get facials and nail care. One of you gets a bath and a bandanna. </p><p>   Hotels aren't the only ones rolling out the welcome mat. As private jet travel has increased during the pandemic, so has the presence of pets on board. Justin Kaminoff, co-founder of Aerial Jets, estimates 25% of passengers on his planes now fly with pets, a 10% increase from six months ago. VistaJet -- which already offered sleep mats, treats baked by Michelin-starred chef Michel Roux and rope toys on board -- now trains its flight attendants in animal CPR, canine vital signs and how to calm animals that have a fear of flying. \"Our training is white-glove training, which means imagining what might come and pre-empting the request,\" said Matteo Atti, VistaJet's executive vice president of marketing and innovation. \"And we thought, why not also do it for the pets?\" </p><p></p>",
