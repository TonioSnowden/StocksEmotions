  "text": "<p>Netflix captured FT readers' attention last week after the popular streaming service warned that subscriber numbers were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70a28358-8720-4f36-a5b4-24dc0f3be9a3\">falling</a> for the first time in a decade. </p> <p>The drop in user figures triggered Netflix shares to plummet almost 40 per cent last Wednesday. The news had a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b63a57-0d46-41c7-8f6b-c61d388db039\">knock-on effect</a> on other streaming groups, with shares in Disney, Roku and Spotify also falling on the same day.</p> <p>Netflix said it would bounce back by improving the quality of programming, charging households that share other users' accounts and launching an advertising-supported version.</p> <p>Financial Times readers piled into the comments beneath the articles on this topic, with many claiming to have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afbf67d1-7349-4fd3-9161-af89b632ba70\">seen it coming</a>. A decline in the quality of Netflix's content was the top explanation given, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/226a28e9-d524-4424-b8ff-02f97d0b37c8\">cost of living crisis</a>.</p> <p>Commenters debated whether Netflix was still good value for money compared with its rivals and satellite television. The issue of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e660195d-9607-4adc-a111-3c7a318da3b4\">piracy</a> was also raised.</p> <p>There was a widespread dislike of the industry's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cea59de9-138c-4f6b-9f41-a8eca3de313f\">pivot towards advertising</a>, with some suggesting that streaming groups should create a subscription bundle or consolidate companies instead.</p> <p>A range of these comments are published below.
