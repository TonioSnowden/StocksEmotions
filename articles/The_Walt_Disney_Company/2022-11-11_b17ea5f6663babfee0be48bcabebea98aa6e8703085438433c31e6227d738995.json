  "title": "How 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Fans Plan to Mourn Chadwick Boseman at the Movies; 'Wakanda Forever' must balance the tragic loss of the late actor with the need to carry on the $1.3 billion franchise",
  "text": "<p>\"We're mourning not only the character, but Chadwick, as well,\" Ms. Stephens-Jamerson, a business management consultant, said of T'Challa, played by the late actor Chadwick Boseman. \"That piece carries a lot of emotional weight.\"</p><p>When \"Wakanda Forever\" arrives in theaters this weekend, it will be more than two years since the death of Boseman, who died of cancer at 43.</p><p>Paying tribute to the actor while also paying homage to this fictional hero is the challenge now facing Marvel, as the sequel to its hit film tries to acknowledge the actor's death with its plot and gracefully chart a future course for the $1.3 billion franchise.</p><p>As the superhero genre has matured, the movies have tried to incorporate bigger emotional stakes along with blockbuster action. But the source of the pathos is usually fictional, such as half the world's people disappearing in \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame.\" The task for \"Wakanda Forever\" is more complicated—it must grapple with real-life loss experienced by creators, cast members and its audience.</p><p>Grief is a major theme of \"Wakanda Forever,\" director Ryan Coogler said at a press conference in October. Mr. Coogler spent a year working on a script oriented around T'Challa before he had to pivot following Boseman's death.</p><p>The film begins with a dramatic scene of T'Challa's sister, Shuri, in her lab racing to find a cure for an illness killing her brother, then turns to a somber memorial service and funeral procession. Opening credits intercut images of Boseman as Black Panther into the Marvel logo.</p><p>Outside nations seeking Wakanda's powerful metal, vibranium, try to take advantage of the power vacuum following T'Challa's death. Shuri and her mother Queen Ramonda (played by Angela Bassett) must ward off these threats—including one from an underwater nation inspired by a Mesoamerican civilization—as they grapple with the anger and loss that comes with mourning. \"T'Challa is dead,\" Queen Ramonda tells Shuri on the anniversary of his death. \"But that doesn't mean he is gone.\"</p><p>When \"Black Panther\" was released in 2018 it became a touchstone for Black audiences, excited by a comic book hero that originated from a technologically advanced African nation. The son of T'Chaka, the first Marvel character to appear in comics as the Black Panther, T'Challa had superhuman powers coming from mastery of martial arts, genius-level intellect and, when necessary to protect Wakanda as the Black Panther, a ceremonial herbal elixir.</p><p>Crowdfunding campaigns raised money to send thousands of children across the country to see the first film. Black leaders such as Michelle Obama came out in support of the film. \"Because of you, young people will finally see superheroes that look like them on the big screen. I loved this movie,\" Mrs. Obama tweeted in 2018.</p><p>The sequel could rake in at least $165 million at the U.S. box office during the opening weekend, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box-office tracker Comscore—which would be a November opening-weekend record. The first movie opened with $202 million domestically. A special edition of \"20/20,\" which aired in November, hosted by Robin Roberts and Whoopi Goldberg featured interviews with cast members and Mr. Boseman's widow, Simone Ledward Boseman. The official \"Wakanda Forever\" podcast is hosted by author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has written \"Black Panther\" comics, while the lead single on the movie's soundtrack is performed by pop star Rihanna, her first new solo song in six years.</p><p>For some, the world of Wakanda offers teachable moments. In 2018, students from the Ron Clark Academy, a private middle school in Atlanta, went viral in a social-media video capturing the moment they were told they would see Black Panther together. For the sequel, the school is planning a three-day program of \"Black Panther\"-inspired classes in science and math and African culture that aims to connect the world of Wakanda with their real world in Atlanta.</p><p>\"When Chadwick passed, we came together again to mourn and grieve, and remember his contributions to not just the film but to Black culture in general,\" said Kirk Brown, Ron Clark Academy's chief development and communications officer. \"Entrepreneurship from Black owners and businesses here is booming. The Black tech industry is booming,\" he says. \"I would definitely say that Atlanta is Wakanda.\"</p><p>Some fans felt that Marvel should've recast T'Challa, rather than move the story beyond him. Tamara Thomas, a designer and product development executive in the Bronx, N.Y., said she disagrees with the decision to not bring T'Challa back with a different actor.</p><p>\"I thought that if Marvel knew how important T'Challa was, they would change course. Not for me, but for the children all over the world who just met T'Challa through the film, through Chadwick,\" Ms. Thomas said. \"Because heroes don't die. People do—especially Black people.\"</p><p>Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has said that recasting Boseman was not an option, since his portrayal \"transcends any iteration of the character in any other medium from Marvel's past.\" Trailers for the movie nodded to someone different donning the Black Panther mask.</p><p>To others, \"Black Panther\" is bigger than one character.</p><p>\"This idea of Wakanda is that beacon of hope,\" Nikkolas Smith, a former facility designer at Walt Disney Imagineering, who illustrated a \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" children's book called \"The Courage to Dream,\" which focuses on a young girl with a disability. \"Kids everywhere are looking for more superhero characters, even everyday Wakandans, to look up to that aren't necessarily Black Panther or T'Challa, especially in this moment.\"</p><p>How 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Fans Plan to Mourn Chadwick Boseman at the Movies</p>",
