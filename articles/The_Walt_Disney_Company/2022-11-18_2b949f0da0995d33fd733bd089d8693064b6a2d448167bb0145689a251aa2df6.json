  "text": "<p>A hundred years later the sign is still standing (minus the “LAND”, removed during a renovation in 1949). But the film business that goes on beneath it is going through a transformation. The content that people watch, and the way they watch it, will change more in the next few years than in the century just passed.</p><p>A cinema-goer transported from 1923 would be wowed by today's colour images and synchronised sound, still experimental a century ago. But much would feel familiar. Studio logos such as Universal's globe and Paramount's star-circled mountaintop appeared on some of the most successful films of the 1920s, as they do today. Disney and Warner Bros will both celebrate their centenaries in 2023.</p><p>The cinema experience is also recognisably similar. Film and sound quality have made giant leaps, as has the size of a tub of popcorn. But bigger innovations—3D films, curving “Cinerama” screens, Smell-O-Vision and so on—have flopped. Anything that cannot be easily reproduced at home is hard to sustain, because films struggle to break even without the TV after-market.</p><p>Much else is transformed, however—and looks likely to change more. Cinemas today might be recognisable to audiences from 1923, but the way they are used is quite different. In 1930 two-thirds of Americans went to the movies at least weekly, to see not just films but news, soap operas and cartoons. In the following decades, as everything except “feature” films shifted to the television, it became an occasional treat. In 2019 the average American went just 3.5 times.Audiences are eschewing multi-million-dollar productions in favour of home-made content</p><p>The disruption caused by covid-19, which reduced worldwide box-office takings by 82% in 2020, will not be temporary. Receipts may never recover, admits one studio chief, who blames the permanent closure of some cinemas during lockdowns and the accelerated adoption of streaming. The latter trend also means that much of the output of “Hollywood” is now overseen by tech firms to the north. Apple, 300 miles (480km) up the coast in Cupertino, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2022, just three years after launching its TV+ service. Amazon, which recently produced the world's most expensive piece of television, “The Rings of Power”, is in Seattle, even father north.</p><p>If time-travellers from 1923 were surprised that their descendants were deserting 20-foot screens for 20-inch ones, they would find the next emerging trend still harder to understand. The average American now spends 50 minutes a day watching video on hand-held devices with screens little bigger than those of Thomas Edison's early Kinetoscope. Children are keener still, with 60% watching full-length TV shows on mobiles at least weekly, according to the Motion Picture Association, which represents America's film studios. In Britain, 16- to 34-year-olds spend more than an hour a day just on YouTube's app, according to Ofcom, the media regulator.</p><p>This would be doubly perplexing to the audiences of a century ago. Not only are consumers ditching big screens for tiny ones. They are also eschewing multi-million-dollar productions for home-made content with lower production values than films of the 1920s. Expect technology to become more advanced and output more lavish, and for audiences to shrug and turn to the blurry home videos streaming onto their tiny screens.</p><p>■</p><p>Tom Wainwright: Technology and media editor, The Economist</p><p>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2023 under the headline “The next episode”</p>",
