  "text": "<p>First of all, as the stylebook says, we lowercase royal unless it is part of a formal name: royal family, royal baby, royal wedding, Royal Ascot and Royal Household, the staff organization. </p><p>As for nobility, we follow our usual practice with titles of any sort, by generally capitalizing titles used before the names, but not generic references: Queen Elizabeth II, the queen. King Charles III; the king. </p><p>Camilla's official title is queen consort (other publications will uppercase the title, but we keep it lowercase in all uses, as we do in America for first lady and the current second gentleman, even before a name). But uppercase queen when referring simply to Queen Camilla. Note that while titles such as duke are similarly lowercase when used on their own, we uppercase phrases such as  the Duke of Wellington when duke is part of a phrase with a location. Members of Britain's House of Lords are referred to by their titles in second references: John Astor, Lord Astor.</p><p>We have entered the correct spelling of Meghan Markle, whose title is Duchess of Sussex, in our Tansa spell-checker (to avoid the misspelling Megan).</p><p>Meanwhile, note that titles aren't used for those who receive British knighthoods, whether they are considered honorary or not, including celebrities who are appointed a \"knight bachelor.\" So, no Sir, Paul McCartney.</p><p>Extreme</p><p>Suddenly everything is \"extreme\"—heat, flooding, rain. It is another bureaucratic word, along with finalize, incentivize and existential, that has infected our articles.</p><p>\"Things that are bad or heavy or 10 other things are now all 'extreme,' \" says Editor in Chief Matt Murray. \"The constant implication is that it is outside the bounds of whatever normal is. Sometimes it's just a hot day.\"</p><p>The stylebook's clichés, overused words entry now lists 73 words and phrases to think twice about. (The vast majority are critical phrases that we should walk back. See what we did there? Those three examples are among the 73 on the naughty list.)</p><p>D.C. spin</p><p>New laws are often named for marketing purposes and aren't necessarily factual indicators of  what's in the legislation.  So we should be cautious in how we deploy the names. In the case of the Inflation Reduction Act, our news articles usually just refer to what it covers, such as the healthcare, climate and tax law (or rearranged versions thereof), says Deputy Editor in Chief Jason Anders. If we use the name, a qualifying phrase such as dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act might be in order.  If someone uses the formal name in a quotation, and the quote is necessary, that is fine.  </p><p>Similarly, we tended to refer to tax overhaul in 2017, rather than the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which wasn't ultimately the official name anyway).</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* Casualties refers to either injuries or deaths, even though many people think of it only in regard to deaths—so avoid it in favor of being specific about each.</p><p>* Clearing House Payments Co. takes no the in our style, even though the company uses one; similarly, Walt Disney Co. even though it calls itself The Walt Disney Company.</p><p>* \"Thursday Night Football\" and other sports programs take quotes around the title, like any other TV show (\"60 Minutes,\" NBC's \"Nightly News,\" \"She-Hulk\").</p><p>* Writers should be cautious about enormity, which many grammar geeks say means great evil or outrageousness in addition to size, not great size. As discussed before, traditionally the correct word for size is enormousness, but that can look clunky and is also debatable. So another choice is immensity. Or let's be plain and simply say size. Or great size.</p><p>* Stable isn't a hospital condition. It is just a statement of the patient's current status. But not a \"condition\" such as good, fair, critical, etc.</p><p>* Market-research company Fact.MR has a period in the middle of its name. That is all right, based on our Company Names entry in the stylebook, since it is punctuation that has a purpose in the middle of a name, similar to E*Trade. But we drop punctuation at the end of a company name that is there just for effect, such as Guess? and Yahoo! (which are Guess and Yahoo to us).</p><p>* We uppercase Frappuccino since it is a Starbucks trademark (its iced coffee). The word has been added to Tansa.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Wrappers' Delight,\" by Adam Kirsch, a nod to the classic Sugarhill Gang \"Rapper's Delight\" song on an article about the late \"wrap\" artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude.</p><p>* \"Private Equity Wants to Wash Your Car,\" by Dan Fitzpatrick and Emily Nelson.</p><p>* \"Shops Ordered Lots of Bikes in 2020. Peddling Them Is an Uphill Climb,\" by Dan Fitzpatrick.</p><p>* And this fun Exchange head  by Matt Murray, Erik Holm and Ethan Smith:</p><p>Back to Work* Or Else **</p><p>*We really mean it this time ** Please don't force our hand</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* Men are completely obsessed with these $128 pants</p><p>* It was one of the safest cities in America. Now it's dealing with a wave of homicides.</p><p>* People are talking about \"quiet quitting\" at their jobs. Here's what that means.</p><p>* The 5 square miles that have become one of America's richest ZIP codes</p><p>* Two decades after its downfall, its name remains a punchline. Revisiting \"one of the biggest professional tragedies in history.\"</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* With $40 million collected by the time the sale started, it looked as if the DAO was suddenly a shoe-in to win.</p><p>* Lululemon is widely credited (or if you're wistful for the days of tailoring and ties, blamed) with kick-starting the leggings-everywhere athleisure trend.</p><p>* The same court, however, started contempt of court proceedings Monday against Mr. Khan.</p><p>* The son of peasants, the world would come to know him as the architect of \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost.\"</p><p>* Born in 1926, two years before Mickey and Minnie Mouse appeared in the first \"Steamboat Willie\" cartoon, her style and silhouette were as distinctive as Minnie's.</p><p>* The league also will increase the size of bases by three inches, a measure it believes will reduce collisions and injuries.</p><p>* This meant there were then eight separate IRAs, with each grandchild needing to calculate their own life expectancy.</p><p>* He reveals that the man whom Simpson claimed was the real \"love of my life\" was Herman Rogers.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* A common misspell, but shoo-in, that is.</p><p>* Blamed with? We might have had to say credited with and blamed for, rather than putting the with after the parentheses.</p><p>* We needed hyphens in contempt-of-court as an adjective phrase.</p><p>* A dangler. The world wasn't the son of peasants.</p><p>* Another dangler. Her style wasn't born.</p><p>* That is, 3 inches. We use numerals for weights and measures.</p><p>* The stylebook says the \"singular they\" (or their) still isn't good grammar but is acceptable in specific reference to someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns.  Use his or her instead, or change the phrase to a plural: grandchildren needing to calculate their own life expectancies.</p><p>* It was the man who Simpson claimed was…. Another case of an overcorrection to whom when who is correct. Use who to replace a he (as applies here), and whom to replace a him.</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.</p><p>ISSN 1054-7041</p><p>Vol. 35, No. 8: Royals</p>",
