  "title": "Starbucks Seeks New Blood in CEO Hunt",
  "text": "<p>\"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now,\" Mr. Schultz said during an interview at company headquarters. \"It requires a different type of leader.\"</p><p>Mr. Schultz returned in April to succeed Kevin Johnson on an interim basis, his third stint running the company he built from a local coffee-shop chain into a global giant. He said Mr. Johnson was a good CEO for the company but he hasn't reached out to him upon returning.</p><p>In recent weeks, Mr. Schultz said, he arrived at work many mornings by 7 a.m. Known for involving himself in all aspects of company decision-making, he wants Starbucks's corporate employees to return to the office. He regularly pops into meetings and greets employees by their first names, and they call him \"Howard\" in return. He rejoined the board, where he said he plans to remain after stepping back as CEO. \"I'm a candidate for a smooth, healthy transition,\" he said.</p><p>Starbucks is a far different chain than it was in 2017, when Mr. Schutz previously stepped down as CEO. Some of Starbucks's current problems are self-induced, Mr. Schultz said, but others are a result of a change in consumer behavior, sped up by the pandemic. The majority of Starbucks's sales now come from cold beverages bought to-go. That's requiring Starbucks to rethink its operations in ways no CEO could have fully anticipated, Mr. Schultz said.</p><p>Starbucks said the company has several viable CEO candidates under consideration.</p><p>Some investors and former executives have wondered about Mr. Schultz's ability to separate himself from the company after his latest return. Mr. Schultz said he was encouraged by the quality and diversity of candidates interested in Starbucks's top job.</p><p>\"My only interest is seeing that person succeed,\" he said.</p><p>In his weeks back on the job, Mr. Schultz said he asked some company veterans to leave to make room for fresh blood. Last month, Starbucks said its chief human-resources officer, executive vice president of public affairs and senior vice president of public policy would depart in May, according to a message viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Two of those executives had worked for the company for more than 15 years.</p><p>As Mr. Schultz expanded Starbucks, he developed a reputation for weighing in on issues such as race and social unrest, and pushing the company and its employees to address them. Those positions sometimes made Starbucks a target of criticism.</p><p>In the past month, Mr. Schultz urged lawmakers to do more to address gun violence after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and extended company benefits to workers who travel for abortions or gender-affirming care. He said he still believes CEOs have a responsibility to speak out on national issues. \"In the environment we are in now, I don't think a company or CEO can hide,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Schultz said company executives need to be careful to be consistent, pointing to what he said was Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek's changing public stance on Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill. Chief executives shouldn't use public political statements as brand advertising, Mr. Schultz said.</p><p>A Disney spokesman declined to comment. The company has said it was re-evaluating its political giving and apologized to employees for not taking a stronger stance on the bill sooner.</p><p>Some Starbucks U.S. workers said they no longer feel as confident in the company, and have organized under the Starbucks Workers United union to bargain for better pay, benefits and treatment. Around 275 of Starbucks's 9,000 U.S. company stores filed for union elections, according to the National Labor Relations Board. The agency certified unions at 72 U.S. stores as of last Tuesday, and Starbucks Workers United officially lost five locations.</p><p>Starbucks executives appealed to workers to maintain a direct relationship with Starbucks, rather than unionizing, and the company is boosting wages this summer.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
