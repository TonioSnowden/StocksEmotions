  "title": "Stock Futures Rise to Start Busy Week of Midterms, Inflation Data; Corporate earnings are also due this week from companies including Lyft, Walt Disney, Occidental Petroleum and Adidas",
  "text": "<p>Stocks finished last week with losses, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 3% for the 10th time this year. The declines came after the Federal Reserve disappointed investors by signaling that officials might raise borrowing costs next year more than they had projected. Friday's jobs data, which showed that the labor market remains strong, further complicated the outlook for the trajectory of interest rates.</p><p>This week, traders are focused on Tuesday's midterm elections and Thursday's inflation data for October, which are expected to show consumer prices increasing at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Corporate earnings are also due from companies including Lyft, which will report after the market closes Monday, as well as Walt Disney, Occidental Petroleum and Adidas.</p><p>Last week's tumble put on pause the sharp rally that the U.S. stock market notched in October. Some traders say they have been encouraged by third-quarter corporate results, which have seen 70% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 so far beating earnings expectations. But many also say they worry any future stock market rebound is likely to be fragile as the economic outlook around the world continues to deteriorate.</p><p>\"It's too soon to call a world recessionâ€¦and economic activity remains decent\" so far, said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. If inflation shows signs of cooling this week, he said, markets could \"see a goldilocks period.\"</p><p>Recently, Mr. Ielpo said his team has added exposure to stock and credit markets, believing the opportunity cost of staying out of the market is too high. About 50% of the firm's flagship multiasset portfolio is sitting in cash, down from 70% before the October stock-market rally.</p><p>Still, he noted, any forthcoming rally in the stock market is likely \"to be highly temporary.\"</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.140%, from 4.157% Friday. Yields and bond prices move inversely.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 currencies, ticked down 0.1%, extending its declines after falling 1.7% Friday.</p><p>Oil markets fluctuated as traders digested Chinese officials' statement this weekend that they would stick to their zero-tolerance Covid-prevention strategy. Brent crude rose 0.1% to $98.64 a barrel after falling earlier in the day.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.4%. In Asia, indexes finished higher even after China's exports to the rest of the world shrank unexpectedly in October. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.7%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise to Start Busy Week of Midterms, Inflation Data</p>",
