  "text": "<p>The pandemic has triggered the equivalent of a “dotcom boom for mental health”, says Alexi Robichaux. But the co-founder and chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/\">BetterUp</a>, the coaching platform that made global headlines after appointing Prince Harry as its chief impact officer, says: “It's only possible because of technology.”</p> <p>The company, which launched in 2013, is “a platform for coaching and mental fitness” focusing on resilience, leadership and motivation rather than psychotherapeutic treatment for mental illness. The company has grown in response to worker isolation and uncertainty and employers' desire to support and boost their remote workforce's productivity. Further, the ubiquity of Zoom has normalised virtual communication. </p> <p>Last month, BetterUp <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/betterup-expands-in-europe-help-workers-worldwide-lead-live-better\">announced its expansion in Europe</a> after a $125m investment raised its valuation to $1.73bn. This year, the privately owned company said its annual recurring revenue had doubled to $100m and coaching sessions were twice the previous year's number.</p> <p>More than 370 companies are customers, including Snap, a social media company, Hilton, the hotels group, tech group Google and&#xa0;recently BP, the energy group, which provides BetterUp's coaching to 5,000 employees. </p> <p>At a swipe of the app, users can access reading materials, leadership coaching, performance psychology or a parenting coach. It provides <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9cf429e-5529-47cf-88e0-7122aaed0240\">anonymised data on employees' engagement</a>, motivation and effectiveness.</p> <p>Executive coaching, a mix of professional and personal development drawing on positive psychology, has become ubiquitous. Once the preserve of executive leaders, it is now part of wider learning and development programmes. Historically, the coaching industry has been fragmented, and a number of intermediaries, such as CoachHub and AceUp, have formed to provide coaches to corporate clients at scale. BetterUp, like other virtual providers, says its ambition is to democratise coaching, though it does have different products for categories of users; its executive cloud for senior leaders, for example, and a professional cloud for managers and high-potential employees. </p> <h2>Hybrid coaching</h2> <p>Robichaux disagrees with my characterisation of executive coaching as a badge of status that requires people to meet face-to-face for the prestige factor. But he does anticipate that as Covid restrictions are relaxed, some senior leaders may want hybrid coaching, a mix of in-person and remote. While he says there is a role for face-to-face coaching he believes that, whether because of the pandemic or generational shifts, the expectation to meet up with a coach is in decline. “Coaching can be a form of feedback,” he adds, and his ambition is that — to use a <em>Star Wars</em> analogy — it will become Yoda on Luke Skywalker's back, providing advice when needed.</p> <p>Most research into the effectiveness of virtual relationships has focused on therapy and found that virtual therapists might prove disinhibiting for the client who is less inclined to feel judged. Magdalena Mook, chief executive of the International Coaching Federation, a professional body, says, the shift may be beneficial. “Some coaches will tell you they are more attuned to a client [virtually] as there's no other distractions.”</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.srh-berlin.de/hochschule/hochschulteam/schermuly-carsten/\">Carsten Schermuly, professor of business psychology</a> at SRH Berlin University of Applied Sciences, says virtual coaching may miss non-verbal cues. “This is a challenge. You have to work more with your voice, empathy, emotions.” </p> <p>The pandemic has accelerated competition between wellness tech products as employers have seized on apps such as Calm and Headspace, which offer digital meditation and relaxation exercises. Mental healthcare platform Lyra recently raised $200m giving it a $4.6bn valuation.</p> <p>While wellbeing is a vague term that spans a range of behaviours from exercise and mindfulness to the rather nebulous self-optimisation, BetterUp claims after three months of use members have observed improved focus, productivity and resilience.</p> <p>Robichaux, born in Dallas, Texas, and living in Austin, says as the Covid crisis progressed, users' priorities changed: they focused less on career progression and more on wellbeing and mental fitness.</p> <p>In an industry that has no formal training standards, Robichaux says the company is trying to provide evidence-based rigour to its work. In 2018 it launched BetterUp Labs, promising to spend up to $20m on behavioural research and draw on business, academics and scientists to provide insights on employee engagement and performance. </p> <p>For those unfamiliar with the coaching industry, it will be Prince Harry's appointment that brought attention to BetterUp, based in San Francisco. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CM0WDlKgJf5/\">An Instagram post</a> on the day his role was announced, highlighted the difference between Prince Harry's British buttoned-up background and his new Californian start-up life. “Self-optimisation is not about fixing something that's broken,” he wrote. “It's about becoming the best version of ourselves, with whatever life throws at us.”</p> <p>Robichaux insists, unsurprisingly, that Prince Harry is more than a figurehead promoting the brand. His role includes driving awareness of the brand and the issue of looking after mental health, including working on partnerships and philanthropy. They also want him to help build a “global community of thought leaders”. He refuses to disclose the prince's salary.</p> <p>They met through a friend, and Robichaux was struck by his passion for mental health and mental fitness. </p> <p>Robichaux's interest in coaching started young. He had “friends who were very precocious” and at 17, was reading Steve Covey, author of <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>, and Dale Carnegie, corporate trainer and author of <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>. Together with Eduardo Medina, who later became his co-founder and chief operating officer, Robichaux mentored students, which he describes as a kind of proto “peer-to-peer coaching”.</p> <h2>Preoccupied with status</h2> <p>At 26, Robichaux “hit a wall”, experiencing night terrors. The start-up where he worked was acquired and he became an executive. Back then he might have said the job took a huge toll on his personal life. “Poor business strategy led to poor culture, which led to confusion, frustration and ultimately burnout.” </p> <p>But now he thinks he was too preoccupied by status and compensation. “I was all in on being this young, hotshot executive. I was miserable. Instead of being happy and fulfilled, I was obsessed with my career trajectory, making sure I kept ahead of the pack . . . It's an incredibly exhausting way to live life.”&#xa0;</p> <p>He realised he needed to change his life. He spent nine months trying to find an answer by doing the <a href=\"https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/the-landmark-forum\">Landmark Forum, a self-improvement movement</a>, immersed himself in psychological work, notably <a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/who-is-martin-seligman/\">Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology</a>, and went on a pilgrimage. Eventually, he found a coach who also did therapy, and became a convert. </p> <p>But he admits the early business model was wrong. BetterUp created a “freemium” product — an app for life skills with the idea it would sell subscribers coaching. In the early days, the business was a “terrible” sell to investors and was rejected by more than 70.</p> <p>Funded by personal savings, credit cards and earnings from jobs such as after-hours delivery routes on food apps,&#xa0;“We were constantly on the brink of bankruptcy,” he says. In 2015, BetterUp raised its first round of funding.</p> <p>One worry among coaches, says Schermuly, is that a platform like BetterUp dominates the sector and becomes the mouthpiece and drives the prices down. “If you're working with an algorithm, who helps you with your routines? Is this coaching?” he says. “No one knows how the coaching platforms will develop.”</p> <p>Robichaux adds that he thought about creating a non-profit. “We've made a lot of dumb mistakes building BetterUp but . . . we wouldn't be here had we not been able to organise as a for-profit organisation. </p> <p>“It's not unusual the greatest leaps have been made by the private sector in almost any area of tech and life,” he says.</p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Emma Jacobs 2021 'BetterUp rides the mental health tech boom' FT.com 12 August.
