  "title": "Iger to Focus Disney on Profit Instead of Adding Subscribers",
  "text": "<p>Dressed in a navy cardigan, white dress shirt and navy slacks, the 71 year-old Mr. Iger tried to ease the nerves of employees after a stressful week of shake-ups and uncertainty. Greeted with a large ovation by a few hundred executives invited to attend in person, Mr. Iger stressed the role of creativity in determining much of the company's strategy going forward.</p><p>Mr. Iger, who was Disney's CEO from 2005 to 2020, said that he was recently listening to the music from the Broadway musical \"Hamilton,\" specifically the song \"What Did I Miss?\" sung by the Thomas Jefferson character, which contains the lines, \"There is no more status quo, but the sun comes up and the world still spins.\"</p><p>\"That's how I feel here,\" Mr. Iger said. \"The status quo is gone, a lot has changed, but the sun is still shining and our world, our Disney world, is still spinning.\"</p><p>Mr. Iger took questions from employees while being interviewed by KABC-TV Los Angeles newscaster Leslie Sykes.</p><p>Disney shares fell more than 3% Monday and are down about 39% since the start of the year.</p><p>In response to a question about economic challenges facing the company, Mr. Iger said that in streaming, Disney would give priority to making money over adding subscribers, signaling a strategic shift that many investors have been calling for since early this year.</p><p>\"We have to start chasing profitability,\" Mr. Iger said. \"It will be demanded of us.\"</p><p>But achieving profitability in streaming could be difficult, analysts have said, now that Disney has moved past its initial growth phase for flagship streaming service Disney+, which initially relied on a partnership with cellphone carrier Verizon to sign up millions of subscribers at discounted entry-level prices.</p><p>\"Bob Iger has always been focused on profitability in basically every business that Disney has, and a leopard doesn't change his spots,\" said Roger Entner, a media and telecom analyst at Recon Analytics LLC.</p><p>Over the past year, Disney+ has added 7.6 million new subscribers in North America, compared with 38.5 million internationally, which includes India's Disney+ Hotstar service. Analysts have highlighted those numbers as proof that the service might be close to reaching its ceiling in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Earlier this month, then-CEO Mr. Chapek outlined companywide cost-cutting measures and told division leaders that layoffs were likely. The austerity measures included a ban on all but essential work travel and a freeze on new hires for all but a few critical positions.</p><p>Mr. Iger said he doesn't have any plans to alter the hiring freeze and said that he is taking cost-cutting measures very seriously. Mr. Iger said he wasn't entirely up to speed on Disney's spending and added that he would spend where it will add value for the company.</p><p>Under Mr. Chapek and as part of his growth plan for the company's streaming services, Disney increased its content spending dramatically, to around $30 billion this fiscal year alone. At the same time, it charged customers far less for Disney+ than most of its rivals, including Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max. This strategy helped attract customers but led to ever-growing losses for Disney's streaming division, which ballooned to $1.47 billion in the most recent quarter.</p><p>\"The three ways to chase profitability here are to cut costs, raise prices, and add subscribers,\" said Brendan Brady, who monitors media and entertainment companies for data provider Antenna. \"Those three tactics can work against one another, which makes it an interesting puzzle to solve. For example, cutting costs might mean less programming and marketing, which makes it more challenging to add new subscribers and to justify increased pricing.\"</p><p>Asked about potential transactions, Mr. Iger said he didn't see any on the immediate horizon.</p><p>\"Nothing is forever, but I'm very comfortable with the set of assets that we have. I think they can serve our company,\" he said, adding \"don't expect any headlines soon about deals.\"</p><p>He declined to comment on reports of a potential eventual sale of Disney to another company such as Apple Inc. but said, \"what you've read is pure speculation not rooted in any fact.\"</p><p>Mr. Iger was asked about the challenges facing Disney's traditional media assets such as the ABC broadcast network and cable channels ESPN and the Disney Channel. He recently made caustic remarks about those businesses.</p><p>\"If you look long term at the future of linear TV, it would be wise to be skeptical or pessimistic about it. How that manifests itself in our company, I don't know,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Iger said he hasn't been fully briefed on a controversial plan to relocate Disney's \"imagineers\" -- the engineers and designers who create the company's theme park rides -- from Southern California to Florida, which has been delayed until 2026. He said he wasn't committed to reversing that decision, but \"it's something I will look into.\"</p><p>A Disney imagineer asked Mr. Iger his opinion on the theme parks' online reservation system and whether or not he intended to keep it. The system, which was implemented when the parks reopened after pandemic-related closures, has become one of the most frequent sources of complaints among visitors, many of whom think it limits flexibility and makes it harder to get tickets on the days they want to visit.</p><p>\"I have not used the parks reservation system,\" Mr. Iger replied. \"I know a lot has been written and said about it, not all positive, but some positive, and before I make any judgment on it, I want to hear more from Josh D'Amaro, who runs that business for us, and have a better perspective.\"</p><p>When prompted to discuss Disney's public spat with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, earlier this year, Mr. Iger said that the company's LGBT employees are very important and that the company cares deeply about them.</p><p>In March, groups of Disney employees staged walkouts in Florida and California over the company's initial failure to take a public stance against a Florida education bill that prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation for schoolchildren through grade three. Mr. Chapek later opposed the law and apologized to employees in a letter for what he said was his failure to support them.</p><p>Mr. Iger said that it isn't easy to respond to political criticism.\"We're not going to make everybody happy all the time, and we're not going to try to,\" he said. \"It's complicated. There's a balance. We do what we believe is right. Some might criticize and say, 'Who are you to say what's right?' When you're in a job like mine, you need to have a sense of what's right.\"</p>",
