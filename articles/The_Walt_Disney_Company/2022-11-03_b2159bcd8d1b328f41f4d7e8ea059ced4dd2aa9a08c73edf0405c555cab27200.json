  "title": "Netflix's Ad Tier Makes Debut",
  "text": "<p>The launch of the company's ad-supported tier of service, called \"Basic with Ads,\" comes a month before rival Disney+ starts its first ad-backed plan and as Netflix tries to boost subscriber growth and revenue after a tumultuous 2022. New ad-backed plans are important elements of a push within the streaming industry to make more revenue per subscriber by offering lower-cost plans that let consumers pay less in exchange for watching ads.</p><p>Among the studios with whom Netflix hasn't yet finalized revised licensing agreements are Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Television, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., people familiar with the negotiations said.</p><p>Disney makes no original content for Netflix, but it provides reruns of popular shows including \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"How to Get Away with Murder.\" NBCUniversal is a big supplier of original and library content to Netflix, including the drama \"You.\"</p><p>Talks also continue with Sony Pictures Television, which makes \"The Crown\" and \"Cobra Kai\" and sells its theatrical movies and reruns of \"Breaking Bad\" to the streamer. Production companies closer to a deal with Netflix include Warner Bros., which makes original shows for and sells library content to the streamer, and they expect to reach an agreement, the people said.</p><p>It is unclear what content from outside suppliers will be missing from the new service. Whether Netflix has the right to insert ads or include content on an ad-supported tier depends on the terms of its initial licensing agreements with studios.</p><p>Netflix has said the tier will include content representing 85% to 90% of viewing on its platform, but it hasn't spelled out what percentage of its library that represents.</p><p>The new Netflix plan will cost $6.99 in the U.S. and will include four to five minutes of ads per hour of content, the company said this past month. It plans to take a \"crawl, walk, run\" approach to entering the ad market, executives have said, which means ad formats and its approach to ad sales will evolve over time.</p><p>---</p><p>Jessica Toonkel contributed to this article.</p>",
