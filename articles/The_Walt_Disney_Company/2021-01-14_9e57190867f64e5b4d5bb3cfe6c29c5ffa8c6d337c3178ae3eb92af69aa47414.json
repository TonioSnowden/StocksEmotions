  "text": "<p>\"WandaVision,\" the first original Marvel series for Disney+, picks up after \"Avengers: Endgame,\" and finds the characters Wanda Maximoff and Vision plopped into the golden age of television, living in a suburb that may not be everything that it appears.</p><p>Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) has the power to bend reality, and Vision (Paul Bettany), is a philosophical half-human, half-robot. The series, which premieres Friday, is in part, an homage to classic family TV series. Director Matt Shakman says the creators enlisted experts from the sitcom genre, hiring a laugh track expert, for example, and even consulting Dick Van Dyke.</p><p>One of the things Mr. Van Dyke told the director was that part of \"The Dick Van Dyke Show's\" boundaries was \"if it couldn't happen in real life, it wouldn't happen on the show.\" This is something Mr. Shakman says they took to heart in \"WandaVision.\"</p><p>\"Our story is about this love story, and that is as human as can be,\" he says. \"And whether you're really good at athletics, or you're really good at art, or you happen to be a superhero, all of these things are sort of second to this core human relationship. And so we are trying to tell a story that, you know, if it couldn't happen in real life, it can't happen on the show.\"</p><p>Family Hour: 'All Creatures Great and Small'</p><p>(PBS, PBS.org)</p><p>In the first episode of \"All Creatures Great and Small,\" a young veterinarian named James Herriot, straight out of school, catches the train in Glasgow in pursuit of his first job -- and what turns out to be a new life -- in the Yorkshire Dales. Herriot is played by Nicholas Ralph, a young actor straight out of school, who hopped a train in Glasgow to shoot the series, his first TV job. \"It was a bit of life imitating art,\" he says.</p><p>The series, which airs Sunday nights on Masterpiece on PBS and is streaming free at PBS.org, is based on the book of the same name by James Herriot (pen name for James Alfred Wight), inspired by his life as a rural veterinarian.</p><p>Ben Vanstone, who created the series -- a surprise hit when it premiered in the U.K. last year -- says he wanted to lean a bit more into the darkness from the books. He also wanted to dig deeper into characters like Herriot's boss, Siegfried Farnon (Samuel West), and the women in the story, such as Mrs. Hall (Anna Madeley), who runs the house that's home to the veterinary practice. \"For me the story of that house has always been about a slightly unconventional family, all finding something in one another that they slightly lacked and that's what brings them together,\" he says.</p><p>New Release: 'One Night</p><p>In Miami'</p><p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>\"One Night In Miami,\" streaming Friday on Prime Video, is set against the backdrop of a real-life meeting between Malcolm X, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Muhammad Ali in 1964. In the film, the four men discuss their careers, their lives and the roles that they play in furthering equality for African-Americans.</p><p>Kemp Powers, who wrote the screenplay -- as well as the stage play on which it is based -- says he uses the four men as avatars for the ongoing conversation in the Black community: \"How do we exist as Black people in this society that is many times hostile toward us? How do we make our way in this world? And what, if any social responsibility do we have as, as Black people who are also Americans.\"</p><p>In the film, Malcom X (Kingsley Ben-Adir) takes the more revolutionary approach while Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) prefers a \"more prudent approach to working within the system to bring about change.\"</p><p>\"I would hope the audience doesn't come down feeling like one is unequivocally right,\" Mr. Powers says. \"Because I don't believe one point of view is unequivocally right.\"</p><p>Escapism: 'Locked Down'</p><p>(HBO Max)</p><p>\"Locked Down,\" a new film starring Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor that's streaming on HBO Max, is about a couple that remains in the same home as they're splitting up because, well, Covid. He's been furloughed and she's been tasked with firing some of her colleagues. As they stare, talk and rage at each other, they begin to pick up some of the pieces of their relationship and fasten together a plan that involves stealing a diamond.</p><p>\"Locked Down\" manages to be both a postcard from the pandemic and an escape from it. \"It's escapism in that they decide to do this outrageous thing, but these are characters that everyone can relate to,\" says director Doug Liman. \"It's not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's in our universe how it exists right now, not as it existed a year ago.\"</p>",
