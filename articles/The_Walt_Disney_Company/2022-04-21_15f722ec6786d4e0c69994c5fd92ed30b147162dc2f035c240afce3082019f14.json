  "title": "Wednesday's Markets:  Netflix Pulls Nasdaq Down  But Blue Chips Strengthen  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Hardika Singh",
  "text": "<p>   Stock indexes posted mixed results and bond yields paused a recent climb as investors assessed the impact of higher inflation on corporate earnings. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.76 points, or less than 0.1%, to 4459.45, a day after the broad-market index closed up 1.6%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 166.59 points, or 1.2%, to 13453.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 249.59 points, or 0.7%, to 35160.79. </p><p>   Stocks have had a strong start to the week, lifted by earnings reports that showed companies have largely been able to generate growth despite tightening monetary policy and the highest inflation in four decades. Netflix's report after hours on Tuesday disappointed, driving losses in the Nasdaq Composite on Wednesday. Procter &amp; Gamble reported its biggest jump in sales in two decades. Investors are scrutinizing corporate performance in an environment with rising prices. </p><p>   \"We are living in a year of higher inflation and that will cause problems for some companies,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"What we are trying to assess is really the pricing power of a company, and some will see their profitability come under pressure if they don't have this.\" </p><p>   Data last week showed that consumer-price index rose 8.5% in March from a year earlier, the fastest annual pace since December 1981. Still, some investors and analysts have said recent economic data contain clues that the surge in inflation may be slowing. </p><p>   \"Inflation might remain at high levels, but certainly we might have seen the worst of the year-over-year increases,\" said Carin Pai, head of portfolio management and head of equity strategy at Fiduciary Trust International. </p><p>   International Business Machines climbed $9.17, or 7.1%, to $138.32 after it reported stronger-than-expected revenue growth driven by its cloud business. Procter &amp; Gamble rose $4.24, or 2.7%, to $163.65 after it raised its full-year guidance and said demand for its pricier items held up. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.836% from 2.911% on Tuesday, reversing direction after three consecutive days of rises. The 10-year inflation-linked bond yield, a proxy for a benchmark real rate, briefly turned positive in intraday trading for a second day after spending more than two years in negative territory, reaching 0.035% before easing to minus 0.082%. </p><p>   Netflix shares fell $122.42, or 35% to $226.19, its largest one-day percentage decrease since 2004, after it said its subscriber base shrank by 200,000 in the last quarter and predicted the loss of an additional two million subscribers this quarter. The S&amp;P 500's communications services sector, of which Netflix is a component, was down 4.1%. </p><p>   \"It is really time to shift the portfolio away from the life at home companies,\" Mr. Filip said. </p><p>   Netflix lost about $54.3 billion in market value Wednesday, a drop larger than the bottom seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 combined, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Other streaming companies fell: Paramount dropped $3.12, or 8.6%, to $33.16; Warner Bros. lost $1.48, or 6%, to $23.01; Walt Disney slid $7.33, or 5.6%, to $124.57; and Spotify fell $14.92, or 11%, to $122.49. </p><p>   Global benchmark Brent crude lost 45 cents a barrel, or 0.4%, to $106.80. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.8%. a loss in the first quarter. Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 1.2%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.9% and China's CSI 300 Index was down 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.5%. </p><p></p>",
