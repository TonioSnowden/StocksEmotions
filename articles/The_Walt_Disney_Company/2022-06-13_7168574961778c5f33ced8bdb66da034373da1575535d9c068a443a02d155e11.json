  "text": "<p>\n  Dinosaurs, fighter pilots and superheroes joined forces to give Hollywood perhaps its most promising box-office weekend this year, with \"Jurassic World Dominion\" delivering the third $100 million-plus opening in six weeks. </p><p>\n  The third installment of the dinosaur franchise, \"Jurassic World Dominion\" collected an estimated $143 million in the U.S. and Canada. The weekend marked a low for the franchise, but is a robust contribution to theater owners following the Memorial Day weekend takeoff of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which took in a record $160.5 million, and the May opening of \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\" which garnered $187.4 million on its opening weekend. The trio of films mark the first time since the pandemic that three movies in simultaneous release have a shot at crossing the $1 billion mark world-wide. </p><p>\n  Having a movie marketplace with three heavyweight titles is welcome news to exhibitors and studios, which until now worried that the postpandemic box office would adopt a \"have's and have-not's\" dynamic where only one major release would draw in audiences at a time. It lends credence to corners of Hollywood eager to reinvest in theatrical releases at a time when Wall Street's enthusiasm for streaming has cooled. </p><p>\n  Every studio has major releases scheduled for this summer -- from \"Lightyear\" to \"Elvis\" -- that will rely on audiences showing up despite inflationary pressures. </p><p>\n  Jurassic World drew in an array of moviegoers, with a particularly strong showing among Hispanic viewers. </p><p>\n  --- </p><pre>  Estimated Box-Office Figures, Through Sunday \n \n                                                              Sales, In Millions \n    Film                          Distributor           Weekend* Cumulative     % Change \n \n1.
