  "text": "<p>How are stock-index futures trading?</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 were down 0.1% at 4,673</p><p>Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00 futures fell 0.1% to 36,166</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 fell less than a percent to 16,199</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 112 points, or 0.31%, to 36320, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 16 points, or 0.35%, to 4685, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 96 points, or 0.6%, to 15887.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>Inflation will swing into focus for Wednesday, with U.S. October consumer prices expected to jump on both headline and core basis — by 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Annual CPI is expected to climb 5.8%, the highest level in 30 years, noted Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.</p><p>Those data will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, alongside weekly jobless claims, with the October federal budget due at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>The CPI update comes a day after news of higher U.S. producer prices. Meanwhile, China on Tuesday reported its own factory gate prices surged 13.5% in October, the highest level since 1996. Consumer prices in the country rose 1.5% to a 13-month high, driven mainly by a jump in prices for food and fuel.</p><p>Investors will be waiting to see if stocks can recover after Tuesday's losses halted an eight-day win streak for the S&amp;P 500 and an 11-session winning run for the Nasdaq Composite. The pause came as talk of a melt-up for stocks has increased amid an unusually strong run-up moving into the holidays.</p><p>“The decline in Tesla was a factor, but ultimately such a straight charge up will just run out of gas sooner or later. The look-ahead to inflation is maybe a factor so this needs to be assessed with today's CPI print,” said Wilson.</p><p>Shares of Tesla TSLA tumbled 11% on Tuesday after a string of headlines that have rattled investors. Founder&#xa0;and CEO Elon Musk over the weekend asked Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock, with the majority saying yes, and his brother Kimbal sold shares a day before that tweet.</p><p>After surging 42% in October, the electric-car maker's stock has dropped 16% this week, though rose 2% in premarket trading.</p><p>And a Tesla rival will begin trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday, as Amazon.com AMZN-backed electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. is due to debut under the ticker symbol RIVN&#xa0;RIVN.</p><p>Rivian priced its initial public offering at $78 a share Tuesday evening, well above its expected range and valuing the company at $77 billion on a fully diluted basis.</p><p>Rivian IPO:5 things to know about the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker</p><p>And: NIO forecast disappoints as Chinese electric-car maker faces supply-chain concerns</p><p>The Walt Disney Co. DIS is among companies due to report earning on Wednesday.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Coinbase Global Inc.COIN stock dropped 11% in premarket trading, after the cryptocurrency platform reported disappointing sales amid a summer slowdown in crypto trading.</p><p>DoorDash Inc.DASH stock climbed 17%, after the delivery company posted record sales and orders, and announced an all-stock deal worth more than $8 billion for Finnish commerce-delivery platform Wolt.</p><p>Upstart Holdings Inc.UPST reported better-than-expected earnings for its latest quarter, but shares of the lending company fell 17% in premarket trading.</p>",
