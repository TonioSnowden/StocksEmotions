  "title": "Netflix Shares Sink as Company Sees Subscriber Growth Slowing; Video streamer cites growing competition and 'an ongoing Covid overhang' for its membership forecast",
  "text": "<p>Netflix stock fell 19% in after-hours trading, while shares of its main streaming rival, Walt Disney Co., were down 3.9%.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will Netflix's price increase make you rethink a subscription to the streaming platform? Why, or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Netflix's subscriber miss came despite a strong content lineup of movies and TV shows including \"Don't Look Up,\" \"The Witcher\" and \"Cobra Kai.\"</p><p>In its letter to shareholders, Netflix said its subscriber growth rates have \"not yet reaccelerated to pre-Covid levels.\" The company said among the reasons for that is an \"ongoing Covid overhang\" and economic difficulties in several parts of the world including Latin America.</p><p>Additional competition also may be a factor, the company said. In the past, Netflix has tended to play down the competition it is facing from newer streaming platforms including Disney's Disney+ and AT&amp;T Inc.'s HBO Max.</p><p>The company also said its subscriber guidance for the current quarter reflected the fact that more of its new content was weighted to the back end of the quarter, including the second season of \"Bridgerton,\" expected to launch in March.</p><p>Last week, Netflix increased the price for its monthly plans in the U.S. and Canada, the first such boost from the streaming platform since 2020. Netflix isn't raising prices across the globe. It cut prices in India last month where it has struggled against strong competition in a market it sees as crucial for growth.</p><p>The company cited programming expenses as the primary reason for the price increase.</p><p>While Netflix has always spent heavily on content, growing streaming competition is driving the company to flood the market with new shows and movies. At the same time, Netflix is canceling shows faster than it used to. New programs have a shorter window to prove themselves than in previous years, producers who work with Netflix said.</p><p>Netflix's revenue rose 16% to $7.71 billion in the quarter, in line with analysts' projections. The company's quarterly earnings were $607.4 million, or $1.33 a share, compared with a profit of $542.2 million, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier. Analysts were targeting 83 cents a share.</p><p>A large chunk of the new subscribers were in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which added 3.5 million subscribers. In the U.S. and Canada, Netflix added 1.2 million, up slightly from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Many analysts expect much of Netflix's growth in the coming year to come from international viewers.</p><p>To attract new audiences, Netflix is expected to spend more creating content in those markets. \"This international growth will increase pressure for the company to develop more and more localized content, with content costs continuing to rise in lockstep with subscriber growth,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.</p><p>Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Shares Sink as Company Sees Subscriber Growth Slowing</p>",
