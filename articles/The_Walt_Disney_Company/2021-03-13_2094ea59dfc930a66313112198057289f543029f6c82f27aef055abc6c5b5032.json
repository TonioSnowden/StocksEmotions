  "text": "<p>    AT&amp;T Inc. said a long-planned version of its HBO Max streaming service supported by ads will launch in June, attaching commercials to a brand that for decades stood for premium content without interruption. </p><p>   Company executives wary of alienating their existing customer base said Friday that the ads won't affect \"HBO Originals\" like \"The Sopranos\" and \"Game of Thrones\" that have long given the premium service its cachet. But they said there is pent-up demand from marketers seeking to reach the HBO Max audience, pointing Friday to $80 million in upfront commitments from advertisers for the new version of the service. </p><p>   \"Advertising, when executed thoughtfully and elegantly, is a powerful way to lower prices for everyone,\" said WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar, who previously led rival streaming service Hulu. </p><p>   The telecom giant has yet to disclose the price of the new service, which is expected to cost less than the $15 monthly price of ad-free HBO Max so that it can appeal to a wider pool of potential customers. </p><p>   HBO gained a reputation for critically praised TV series sold through cable providers. Its online cousin went to market last year with a cache of added content from Warner Bros. studios and new licensing deals. The service was designed to adapt the brand for a streaming-media boom dominated by cheaper services like Netflix and Disney+. </p><p></p>",
