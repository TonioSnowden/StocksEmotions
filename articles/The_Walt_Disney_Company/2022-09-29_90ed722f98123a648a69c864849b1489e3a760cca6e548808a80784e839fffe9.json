  "text": "<p>At least one death during the storm was reported Thursday morning. The Volusia County Sheriff's Office said a 72-year-old man in Deltona, Fla., northeast of Orlando, drowned after he went outside to try to drain his pool. The man, who officials didn't identify, was found in a canal behind his home.</p><p>Ian gradually weakened as it barreled over central Florida overnight to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles an hour, the National Hurricane Center said in an update at 8 a.m. ET.</p><p>According to the tracking site poweroutage.us, nearly 2.6 million Florida customers were without power Thursday morning, with outages concentrated in the southwest and center of the state.</p><p>President Biden declared a major disaster in Florida Thursday in the wake of Hurricane Ian's destruction in the state, a move that makes federal funding available to the region.</p><p>The White House said the action makes federal assistance available to individuals in the counties. The aid can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses.</p><p>As Ian moved across the state, it dumped large amounts of rain on central Florida, causing what the National Weather Service described as life-threatening and catastrophic flooding.</p><p>On Thursday morning, Orlando police warned people to stay off the roads and reported flash flooding at several roadways and intersections. Strong winds bent trees and tossed debris through the air. Businesses—from Disney World to local convenience stores—were closed.</p><p>Utility crews suspended repair work as the storm raged. All schools were closed. Lauraleigh Avery, emergency manager for Orange County, where Orlando is located, said of the metro area's 2.7 million residents, \"Wherever they are, they need to stay put.\"</p><p>Authorities in the cities of Naples and Fort Myers issued curfews late Wednesday. Emergency crews worked through the night to try to help residents and minimize the loss of life, Fort Myers Fire Chief Tracy McMillion said early Thursday. He encouraged residents to stay inside and observe the citywide curfew. \"Our first responders are doing their best to assess current conditions and assist urgent, life threatening situations. We have portions of the city under 3-4 feet of water and there are emergencies underway,\" the local government said in a statement.</p><p>In Naples, where half the roads were impassable according to authorities, police posted footage to Twitter showing widespread destruction, with many streets submerged. A local fire station was flooded, leaving firefighters wading through waist-high waters and clambering to save equipment from flooded firetrucks. Other social media posts by residents showed homes and vehicles being washed away. The city gave no indication of casualties.</p><p>The hurricane made landfall near the island of Cayo Costa, Fla., off the coast of Fort Myers, just after 3 p.m. ET on Wednesday as one of the strongest storms on record to hit the U.S.</p><p>The storm was expected to fully cross over the state and reach the Atlantic Ocean by Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. While Ian was set to continue losing strength as it moved north, forecasters warned that it could still produce strong winds when it arrived over Florida's East Coast.</p><p>Ian's catastrophic storm surge left a devastating mark on the western Florida coast as the hurricane swung inland. On late afternoon Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said a catastrophic storm surge of 12 to 18 feet above ground and destructive waves struck the southwest Florida coast, stretching from Englewood to Bonita Beach, including Charlotte Harbor.</p><p>The impacts from the storm were expected to last for days. The southeast was girding for widespread, heavy rainfall as Ian crosses Florida's peninsula along a northeast track and continues as a tropical storm over the Atlantic Ocean. It may strengthen slightly to hurricane intensity as it approaches the South Carolina coast on Friday.</p><p>Northeast Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina's Lowcountry are projected to see 4 to 8 inches of rain, with some areas receiving as much as a foot. The rest of South Carolina along with North Carolina and southern Virginia are also bracing for heavy rains in the 3 to 6 inches range, with up to 8 inches possible.</p><p>The storm's southward track spared the heavily populated and flood-vulnerable Tampa Bay area from a direct hit, though the region is still poised to feel the hurricane's effects, including significant rainfall.</p><p>Thousands of National Guard troops and utility workers were mobilizing to prepare for the hurricane's aftermath. As the storm bore down on the Florida coast Wednesday, convoys of utility bucket trucks headed south along I-75 toward the state from Georgia.</p><p>Ian has caused widespread transportation disruptions, including airport closures and at least 2,135 cancellation within, to or from the U.S. on Wednesday, according to flight-data tracker FlightAware. Some airports in the state closed through Thursday. Florida's biggest seaport, Jacksonville, and Port Canaveral on the state's Atlantic coast joined the Tampa port in shutting down entirely on Wednesday.</p><p>\"It will be one of the storms people always remember,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Cameron McWhirter and Alyssa Lukpat contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Gareth Vipers at gareth.vipers@wsj.com, Elizabeth Findell at Elizabeth.Findell@wsj.com and Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com</p><p>Hurricane Ian Leaves Florida Reeling, Knocks Out Power to Millions</p>",
