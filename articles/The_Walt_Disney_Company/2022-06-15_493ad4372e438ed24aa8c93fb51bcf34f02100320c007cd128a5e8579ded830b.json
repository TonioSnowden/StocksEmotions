  "text": "<p>The results of the auction -- conducted digitally over the course of several days -- make IPL cricket the world's second-most valuable sports league on a per-game basis after the National Football League, said Jay Shah, secretary of the BCCI. Competition for the rights became fierce in recent months, with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube unit, Amazon.com Inc., and Sony Pictures Networks India in the mix at various moments, along with Disney and Viacom18, according to the BCCI.</p><p>\"The important thing here was transparency,\" Mr. Shah said. \"That's what allowed the price to climb so high.\"</p><p>Disney said early Tuesday that it bowed out of the race for streaming rights because the price got too high.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
