  "text": "<p>\"In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend and father to his two young children,\" said a tweet signed by the Gottfried family. \"Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in Gilbert's honor.\"</p><p>Mr. Gottfried's best known role is Iago, the wisecracking bird in the 1992 Disney animated movie \"Aladdin.\" His voice was so recognizable that it was used in numerous commercials, voicing the Aflac duck for the insurance company. Before that, he appeared in a series of films, including 1990's \"Problem Child\" and 1987's \"Beverly Hills Cop II.\"</p><p>\"Seinfeld\" actor Jason Alexander tweeted his condolences: \"Gilbert Gottfried made me laugh at times when laughter did not come easily. What a gift. I did not know him well but I loved what he shared with me. My best wishes and sympathy to his family.\"</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Gilbert Gottfried, Legendary Comedian, Dies at Age 67 After Long Illness</p>",
