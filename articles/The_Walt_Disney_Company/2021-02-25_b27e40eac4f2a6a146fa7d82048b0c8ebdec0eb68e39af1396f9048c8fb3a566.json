  "text": "<p>Paramount+ will cost $4.99 a month with ads and $9.99 without, the company said Wednesday, adding that the ad-free version would feature additional sports, news and entertainment programming.</p><p>The streaming service, whose ad-free version will launch in the U.S. on March 4, will include a movie library with over 2,500 titles from the Paramount and Miramax movie studios, Mr. Bakish said Wednesday.</p><p>Every new Paramount movie would become available on the Paramount+ platform after appearing in theaters, he added.</p><p>\"In short, if you love movies, Paramount+ is a streaming service that you can't live without,\" Mr. Bakish said.</p><p>ViacomCBS's decision to shorten the theatrical window follows similar moves by rivals including Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal and AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia that are seeking to balance their lucrative theatrical exhibition businesses with the success of their own video-streaming services, which have become central to their owners' corporate strategies.</p><p>ViacomCBS isn't being quite as bold as WarnerMedia, which last year decided to put all its 2021 theatrical movies on its HBO Max streaming service at the same time they premiered in movie theaters.</p><p>Mr. Bakish said that ViacomCBS plans to debut 36 original TV series on Paramount+ during 2021, with 50 original TV series appearing exclusively on the service within two years of its launch. The company aims to turn its studios into a production hub for Paramount+ to provide a steady stream of original content for the service, Mr. Bakish said.</p>",
