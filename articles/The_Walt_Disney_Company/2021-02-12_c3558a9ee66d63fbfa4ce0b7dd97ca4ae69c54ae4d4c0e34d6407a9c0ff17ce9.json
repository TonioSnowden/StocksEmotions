  "title": "Disney Ekes Out Profit Amid Pandemic  ----  By Erich Schwartzel and Allison Prang",
  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co. typically reports its first-quarter earnings with news of a Christmas Day blockbuster performance at the box office or a holiday surge in theme-park attendance. On Thursday, however, the company again demonstrated how Covid-19 has brutalized its bottom line. </p><p>   Still, its quarter beat pessimistic Wall Street estimates, and Disney registered a profit of $17 million, or 1 cent a share. The blow came from Disney's legacy businesses: Two-thirds of North American movie theaters remain closed, and Disneyland is closed to anyone who isn't showing up for a Covid-19 vaccine shot. </p><p>   In the comparable period a year ago, before the Covid-19 pandemic started to affect the U.S., Disney's profit was $2.11 billion, or $1.16 a share. Disney's first-quarter profit comes after the company reported two quarterly losses in a row. But in a sign of how much has changed at the world's largest entertainment company, Disney earned about 2% of the domestic box-office gross of the company's top-performing 2019 release, \"Avengers: Endgame.\" </p><p>   With the traditional movie business hurting, Bob Chapek, approaching his one-year anniversary as Disney's chief executive officer, reiterated the shift toward a streaming-first model. </p><p>   \"Our goal is to increasingly put the consumer in charge,\" said Mr. Chapek. </p><p>   The company's flagship streaming service, Disney+, added more than 21 million new subscribers in the first quarter to hit 94.9 million subscribers as of Jan. 2, compared with 73.7 million subscribers at the end of the fourth quarter. The service launched in November 2019. </p><p>   Disney remains a tale of two companies, and the quarterly performance underscored its high-stakes pivot toward the direct-to-consumer streaming business. Disney executives provided some details of what a post-Covid company might look like now that vaccinations have begun and the reopening of theaters and parks is on the horizon. The company maintains that \"Black Widow,\" a Marvel superhero movie scheduled for release in May, will get a theatrical debut, and said mass vaccinations by April would be a \"game changer\" for its struggling parks division. </p><p>   All told, the Disney division that includes its theme-park business registered a $2.6 billion hit from Covid-19 in the quarter, the company said. Even when the parks open, Mr. Chapek said he expects social-distancing and mask-wearing to be required at least through year-end. </p><p>   The pandemic has forced some hard decisions that might have once been considered \"heresy,\" said Mr. Chapek. </p><p>   Wall Street seems to have its eye on one figure: Disney+ subscribers. </p><p>   In December, Disney revised subscriber projections to reach as many as 260 million by 2024, a benchmark that sent its stock price soaring. Disney shares rose about 2% in after-hours trading on Thursday. </p><p>   Disney said its adjusted earnings were 32 cents a share. According to FactSet, Wall Street expected an adjusted loss of 34 cents a share. </p><p>   Total revenue at Disney fell 22% to $16.25 billion, with revenue falling in both the company's media and entertainment distribution and parks, experiences and products segments. </p><p></p>",
