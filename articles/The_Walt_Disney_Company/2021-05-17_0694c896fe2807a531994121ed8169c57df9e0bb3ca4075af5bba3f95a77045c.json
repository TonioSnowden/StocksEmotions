  "text": "<p>AT&amp;T went to war with Donald Trump's Department of Justice for this? On Sunday, reports emerged that the sputtering telco juggernaut was close to spinning off and then combining its media business with Discovery, the latter a hodgepodge of cable networks trying to swing it in digital streaming. The combination's enterprise value would be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5aeba5f9-2e00-4cba-b9c7-e0431aad798b\">about $150bn</a>.</p> <p>Just three years ago, AT&amp;T had closed its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45fd9800-988a-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae\">$109bn deal for Time Warner</a> after a bruising tussle with the government's antitrust suit. AT&amp;T over the past decade has tried to move beyond its mobile, broadband and wireline phone businesses to be a serious Hollywood player. Instead, its two big acquisitions — Time Warner and DirecTV in 2014 for $67bn — proved to be millstones as first Netflix and now Disney came to dominate digital entertainment. Discovery has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbc29a04-5688-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc\">carved out a nice niche</a> of low brow, low-cost reality TV (eg <em>Naked and Afraid</em>). Yet whatever heft it gains by joining forces with WarnerMedia is tempered by an odd strategic fit. Clearly, AT&amp;T is desperate to cut this cord.</p> <p>Pre-pandemic in 2019, Discovery generated almost $5bn of ebitda. However, as paid TV subscriptions slowly melt, it recently launched its own straight-to-consumer product. It says the right things about how the economics are good enough to avoid cannibalisation, but the company's long-term viability was in doubt as the entertainment field narrows to a handful of $100bn-plus players.</p> <p>WarnerMedia's HBO and its recently launched HBO Max streaming service together have about 44m US subscribers paying on average $12 a month. But the growing and uncertain cost of content and the $150bn net debt load AT&amp;T carries complicated the company's hefty dividend as well as its ability to focus on 5G supremacy in its core mobile phone business.</p> <p>Since the announcement of the DirecTV deal in 2014, AT&amp;T shares are down a tenth, a figure that would be worse if AT&amp;T had not fortuitously avoided cutting its dividend. In that time period, Netflix shares are up more than 700 per cent. Two telcos that did not stray into content, Charter Communications and T-Mobile, are up at least 300 per cent. AT&amp;T rejoiced when it defeated the government and closed on buying Time Warner. For AT&amp;T shareholders, the victory has proved pyrrhic.</p> <p><em>This note was published before the announcement of deal details.
