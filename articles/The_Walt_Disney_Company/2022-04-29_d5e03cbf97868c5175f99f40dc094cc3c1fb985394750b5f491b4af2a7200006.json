  "title": "Technology:  Netflix Bets on Asia  To Bolster Growth  ----  By Jiyoung Sohn in Seoul, Vibhuti Agarwal in New Delhi and Miho Inada in Tokyo",
  "text": "<p>   When Netflix Inc. recently disclosed it had suffered its first subscriber pullback in a decade, only one region showed growth: Asia. </p><p>   Home to roughly half the world's population, Asia is a relatively untapped market where streaming habits are still forming. Hundreds of millions of subscribers could still potentially be up for grabs, as growth starts to drag in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. </p><p>   But Netflix faces formidable challenges to keep expanding in countries across Asia. The world's key streaming battleground is crowded -- and altogether cheaper. </p><p>   Park Sae-eun, a tech industry worker in Seoul, enjoys Netflix but spends the bulk of her time streaming South Korean shows on two different local services that offer a wider library of domestic content. If the mega hits stop coming, she would consider dropping her Netflix subscription. \"Without original shows, it wouldn't be worth using Netflix,\" said Ms. Park, 27 years old. \"For local shows, there are several other platforms that could become Netflix replacements.\" </p><p>   Winning in Asia may require bigger investments to create or license local content for cost-conscious consumers, or risk losing ground in a crowded field. Even for programming made outside the region, the bar is higher to grab attention across the Asia-Pacific, due to language or cultural differences. Most consumers want to see shows and movies in their native language, even if they enjoy foreign-produced shows. </p><p>   In addition to Netflix's deep-pocketed U.S.-based rivals, like Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video, the competition in Asia includes hundreds of local upstarts armed with more in-country offerings, with plans sold at lower prices. </p><p>   There are dozens each in South Korea and Japan, 40 in Hong Kong and Taiwan and more than 70 across Southeast Asia, according to Media Partners Asia, a Singapore-based market researcher that tracks various types of on-demand video-streaming services in the region. Netflix's cheapest plan in India, where it recently slashed prices to compete with 80 competitors, goes for about $2 a month -- triple what some homegrown options charge. </p><p>   That magnifies the pressure for Netflix to keep churning out blockbusters that can justify the higher price tag, just as the company pulls back on its lavish spending. What makes Asia different is that streaming is still so relatively new that many viewers are still making up their minds, said Vivek Couto, executive director at Media Partners Asia. </p><p>   More than three-quarters of households in matured streaming markets like the U.S. have already subscribed to a subscription video streaming service, according to Media Partners Asia. But even in wealthier parts of Asia, like South Korea and Japan, adoption is at less than half of all households, the researcher says. Roughly 10% of households use a subscription video streaming service in India and many parts of Southeast Asia, which together represent about a quarter of the world's population. </p><p>   Even so, the Asia-Pacific region is already the single largest market for on-demand video streaming subscriptions. It accounts for 43% of the world's subscriber base as of this year, according to Ampere Analysis, a London-based research firm. That compares with 29% from North America, 16% from Europe and 8% from Central and South America. No region is projected to grow as quickly as Asia in the coming years, Ampere estimates. </p><p>   The region's numbers include China, which is stocked with domestic options and remains largely sealed off from foreign companies. </p><p>   Netflix has about 220 million paid memberships world-wide. The 1.1 million subscribers added in the Asia-Pacific region during the first three months of the year represented the only area of quarterly growth in the company's subscriber base. </p><p>   Netflix entered Asia in the middle of the last decade, often as the first streaming service. </p><p>   Netflix has learned plenty about local consumers' preferences and continues to see opportunities for further investment, said Minyoung Kim, who oversees Netflix's creative activities and content in the Asia-Pacific region except for India. </p><p>   Netflix came ready to spend on local shows that could help build an audience. In South Korea, it has spent more than $1 billion on local content, including \"Squid Game,\" the dystopian drama that became its most-watched show ever. </p><p>   Some of Netflix's U.S.-based rivals are also moving aggressively into making Asian content of their own. Disney+ wants to green light more than 50 original productions for the Asia-Pacific region by next year, the company said. </p><p>   Netflix currently holds the No. 1 spot in many markets across Asia. India, where it slashed prices as much as 60% for some plans, is a major exception. The top player there is Disney-owned Hotstar, which had 51 million subscribers in 2021, owing to having the streaming rights to India's most popular cricket league, according to Media Partners Asia. </p><p>   The price wars can mean a race to the bottom. Netflix, for now, has Vietnam all to itself. But in November, seeking to capture more viewers, it began offering free access to some of its most-popular shows -- including \"Money Heist\" and \"Emily in Paris\" -- to people using Android smartphones. </p><p></p>",
