  "text": "<p>The launch, seven months after Netflix said it would enter the ad business, shows the urgency with which the streaming giant is trying to attract new customers and improve its average revenue per user. The company reported back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses in the first and second quarters and is scheduled to announce its performance for the September quarter on Oct.18.</p><p>Greg Peters, Netflix's chief operating officer, said existing subscribers would remain in their current plan at the same price. They must choose to change to the ad-supported plan if they wish to do so.</p><p>Disney, meanwhile, plans to raise the price of its basic plan from $7.99 to $10.99 in December, and those who don't wish to pay more will start seeing ads.</p><p>Not all of Netflix's vast library will appear on the ad-backed service, the company said, because of licensing restrictions that it continues to work on. Users also won't be able to download content as they can on other tiers of service. Netflix's ad tier and basic tier will have lower resolution for viewers than premium tiers, but will still be high definition.</p><p>The plan will display four to five minutes of ads per hour and ads will typically be 15 seconds or 30 seconds long, playing before and during content. The company said it has nearly sold out its ad inventory at launch.</p><p>Netflix is offering advertisers the ability to target ads broadly based on country and genres like romance, science fiction and action, and letting brands opt out of advertising alongside sexual or graphically violent content, the company said.</p><p>Write to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse+1@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix to Charge $6.99 a Month for New Ad-Supported Tier</p>",
