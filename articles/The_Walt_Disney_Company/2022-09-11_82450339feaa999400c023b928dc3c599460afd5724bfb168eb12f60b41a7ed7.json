  "title": "Activist Investor Dan Loeb Backs Off Pushing Disney to Sell ESPN; Investor said he wants to see Disney move forward with ESPN's 'growth and innovation'",
  "text": "<p>\"As Bob has said, ESPN is an integral part of The Walt Disney Company, and he believes that its full potential will continue to be realized as we execute against our strategic vision for the most trusted brand in sports,\" said Disney spokeswoman Kristina Schake on Sunday.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC announced that it had renewed its stake in Disney stock after having liquidated one earlier this year. He sent a letter to Mr. Chapek asking for major changes to Disney's business, including spinning off ESPN, refreshing Disney's board and cutting spending.</p><p>\"We have a better understanding of ESPN's potential as a stand-alone business and another vertical for [Disney] to reach a global audience to generate ad and subscriber revenues,\" Mr. Loeb wrote on Twitter Sunday morning. \"We look forward to seeing [ESPN chief James] Pitaro execute on the growth and innovation plans, generating considerable synergies as part of The Walt Disney company.\"</p><p>Mr. Loeb declined to comment beyond his tweets, a spokeswoman said. Messrs. Loeb and Chapek \"have regular conversations\" and are currently in close contact, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The new stake for Mr. Loeb's fund represented less than 1% of Disney's shares outstanding and at the time had an economic value of around $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.</p><p>Disney shares are down 26.5% this year as of the close of trading Friday. In August, the company reported stronger-than-expected financial results and an addition of 14.4 million subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service.</p><p>Last month, Disney said in response to Mr. Loeb's Third Point letter, \"We welcome the views of all our investors.\" The company said its board has been continuously refreshed, \"with an average tenure of four years.\"</p><p>The idea of selling ESPN—which sends a steady flow of cash to Disney via licensing agreements with cable TV operators—has come up frequently in recent years as the price of sports broadcast rights has steadily risen. Some investors have argued that ESPN is more valuable as a stand-alone company than as a division of Disney.</p><p>The network is home to some of the most-watched events on television and it attracts huge numbers of prime-time viewers, according to Nielsen. ESPN also brings in significant fees to Disney. On average, every American with a pay-TV package that features ESPN pays more than $100 a year for access to the network, according to Kagan, a media research group within S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>For Disney, ESPN+, the streaming service attached to the sports network is growing. ESPN+ has 22.8 million subscribers, Disney reported last month, a 53% gain from a year earlier.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Activist Investor Dan Loeb Backs Off Pushing Disney to Sell ESPN</p>",
