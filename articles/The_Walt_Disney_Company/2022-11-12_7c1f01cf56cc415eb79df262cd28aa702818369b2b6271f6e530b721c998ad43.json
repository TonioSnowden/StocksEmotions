  "text": "<p>\n  The Magic Kingdom </p><p>\n  By Russell Banks </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Toad </p><p>\n  By Katherine Dunn </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Now Is Not the Time to Panic </p><p>\n  By Kevin Wilson </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In Disney World, \"between the Rainforest Cafe and the Animal Kingdom,\" an archivist attests in Russell Banks's novel \"The Magic Kingdom\" (Knopf, 332 pages, $30), there is an old, untended Shaker cemetery commemorating the members of the commune that owned the land in the early years of the 20th century. The Shakers famously practiced celibacy, so their movement was not designed to endure, yet the purity of this impermanence has secured them a lasting place in historical memory. Their brief settlement on what would become Disney property has given Mr. Banks an irresistible juxtaposition for a novel that movingly dramatizes the conflicts between religious utopianism and worldly desires. </p><p>\n  Loosely based on real events -- I don't know if the cemetery is real, but the former Shaker colony near Orlando very much is -- \"The Magic Kingdom\" is presented as the transcribed tape recordings of Harley Mann, who grew up in the community before buying the land and making a fortune in real estate. Harley was not technically a Shaker: His widowed mother brought him and his siblings to the New Bethany Shaker community when he was a teenager, and though he never formally pledged himself he was raised with those who did by the dynamic and somewhat mysterious Elder John Bennett. </p><p>\n  The Shaker custom was to eschew profit-making business practices, but Harley recalls that Elder John, insulated by his distance from the sect's headquarters in the northeast, ran New Bethany \"as if he were managing a plantation, not a religious commune.\" Whether this is hypocrisy or a pragmatism necessary for the protection of his flock is never fully resolved. Nor is the nature of his relationship with a penniless young woman named Sadie Pratt, who is sheltered by the Shakers as a charity case after the tuberculosis sanitarium where she was a patient closes down. Harley develops an intense adolescent obsession with Sadie, and the delicate triangular relationship he forms with her and Elder John creates the conditions for the novel's engrossing tragic conclusion. </p><p>\n  Mr. Banks, now 82, has reached the elegiac period of his long and distinguished writing career. His previous novel, \"Foregone\" (2021), was also framed as an old man's remorseful confession about the errors of his youth. But that book, exposing the disillusions of the 1960s protest era, was oddly sour and dreary. \"The Magic Kingdom,\" however melancholic, is wistful and tender in comparison. The commune's precarious existence on the Florida swamplands is depicted with pleasing fullness. And though Harley's tale is riven by passion and betrayal, it has no obvious villains. Mr. Banks has created a quietly beautiful memorial to a transitory way of life that would soon disappear behind the theme-park attractions of contemporary America. </p><p>\n  Katherine Dunn's acerbic posthumous novel \"Toad\" (MCD, 338 pages, $28) bids goodbye and good riddance to the rootless bohemian lifestyle of 1970s Oregon. The narrator is Sally Gunnar, who lives like a hermit in Boston, receiving monthly disability checks following a nervous breakdown. Her mental collapse, and the story she recalls, have to do with her years in Portland in the company of dilettante intellectuals she met at Reed College. The leader of the cohort is Sam, who presides like the hippie lord of a squalid apartment, where the bathtub is coated in cat excrement and you have to scour the chopsticks with sandpaper to get them clean. </p><p>\n  Sally, then \"a great follower of persons,\" is unhealthily infatuated with Sam, but because she's overweight he views her as an ego-stroking admirer rather than a love interest. Instead he knocks up a wispy chick named Carlotta, moves with her to the woods and, aided by Sally's visits and provisions, haphazardly prepares to father one of the most ill-omened babies ever born into a novel. </p><p>\n  Dunn, who died in 2016, was the author of the cult-favorite \"Geek Love\" from 1989, about genetically modified circus freaks. There has long been speculation about a follow-up novel, but \"Toad\" is not that. It is, rather, an unpublished manuscript from the 1970s, when Dunn was a single mother in Portland working subsistence-level, and sometimes dangerous, service jobs. The stresses of her circumstances make this a highly uneven book, repetitive and unprocessed. But its anger is raw, bitterly comic and frequently startling. What most activates Dunn's rage is the misogyny that only deepened amid all the pretended freedoms of the counterculture. Refreshingly, this is not a simple victim's story, as Sally's loath-ing for her so-called friends is matched by her disgust for her own past meanness and insecurity. Her isolation, in the end, is less a form of emancipation than a self-imposed penance. </p><p>\n  Frankie Budge recounts the formative summer of her youth in Kevin Wilson's latest novel, \"Now Is Not the Time to Panic\" (Ecco, 246 pages, $27.99). Sixteen and bored in the poky Tennessee city of Coalfield, she meets Zeke, another lonely, creative type from a dysfunctional family. Their burgeoning romance begins with an impromptu art project: The pair designs a poster bearing a cryptic, vaguely sinister message and then clandestinely distributes copies of it all over Coalfield. But quickly the inside joke is blown out of proportion, inspiring fears of Satanic cults among the confused townspeople. Copycat posters appear, as well as armed vigilantes, leading to accidental deaths. Suddenly the \"Coalfield Panic\" is national news and the pressure on Frankie and Zeke, who have kept their role a secret, becomes unbearable. </p><p>\n  It's a clever, if farfetched, premise that entertainingly explores the fallout of subversive art, much like Mr. Wilson's wonderfully funny first novel, \"The Family Fang\" (2011), about the lunacy of growing up with performance-artist parents. But the writing evinces a regression I find worrisome. Frankie retells events decades later, after a journalist uncovers the truth of what happened. But though she's grown up, her narration is marked by teen-fiction preciousness -- crying jags, roller-coaster emotions and prose with the breathlessly juvenile habit of beginning every sentence with \"And . . . And . . . And . . .\" There is, unfortunately, a market niche for adult-targeted novels with YA sensibilities. But I think Mr. Wilson is too talented a writer to settle for filling it. </p><p></p>",
