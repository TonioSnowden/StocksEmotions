  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>The Chinese Communist party is preparing to do something it has only done three times in its existence when it meets on Monday for the sixth and penultimate plenum of its five-year term, and it has echoes of a dark period in the country's past. </p> <p>The only advertised item on the agenda for the four-day event is a resolution on the “important achievements and historical experiences of the party's 100 years of struggle” — a measure only previously undertaken by Deng Xiaoping in 1981 and Mao Zedong in 1945. That first “historic resolution” condemned those with dissenting views to Mao, preparing the way for him to become sole leader. </p> <p>This week's vote will pass, clearing the way for current president, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15b7036e-7f2d-48d2-8c61-a8163e764377\">Xi Jinping</a>, to secure an unprecedented third term at the Chinese Communist party's 20th congress next year. China is now undergoing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacf9b6a-326b-4aa9-a8f6-2456921e61ec\">new control revolution</a>.</p> <p>This is a week of anniversaries — most notably, the end of the first world war and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Both of these have a resonance for Germany, which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f53ebd5-92ea-41bc-b758-d1fb1fb0b08a\">considering its future post Merkel</a>. </p> <p>It is a reminder for all of us, however, about why we need to be aware of where we have come from as well as looking forward to events.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>Among the results this week are two British high-street brands. First, we have Marks and Spencer, which is midway through its latest, and by common consent, most far-reaching turnround effort. Profit upgrades at M&amp;S have hardly been commonplace over the past three decades, so even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c0adf8e-0026-4b6d-90b1-58a8c5c97b37\">an acknowledgment in August</a> that full-year profits would be at the top end of forecasts was enough to trigger a rally in the shares. They have now doubled since the depths of the pandemic last year. </p> <p>Investors will be looking for evidence this week that the changes it is putting in place are yielding durable results. Sector-wide concerns such as supply-chain cost pressures — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4a37350-8d23-4a92-9727-3ebcd81e859c\">this piece</a> on that subject by Tim Harford is very good, by the way — and the prospect of deteriorating household finances will also be in focus. Analysts are at present expecting revenue of about £5bn for the six months to September, with operating profit of £350m.</p> <p>The emergence from lockdown has been key for Associated British Foods. In the last full year before the pandemic, two-thirds of ABF's annual operating profit came from clothing, in the form of cut-price fashion retailer Primark. </p> <p>In the year to September, analysts expect it to be comfortably less than half the group total after lockdowns forced its 380 shops across Europe and the US to close for extended periods. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/199f5851-23cf-48f0-b7c1-14a0e93a65cc\">stores traded strongly</a> when they were open, and investors will want reassurance that is still the case.</p> <p>Another earnings announcement to watch is Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca on Friday, particularly after&#xa0;Pfizer last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5054863d-2c1e-4e2b-89ab-5d1a4a2ff0f8\">raised its revenue forecast</a> for its Covid-19 vaccine to $36bn in a bullish results statement. </p> <p>Investors want AstraZeneca to clarify if it even plans to sell its Covid shot after the pandemic is over — the jab still has not received approval in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62ccfaa4-9427-4182-8c60-872aa431c587\">the world's largest pharmaceutical market, the US</a>. </p> <p>But AstraZeneca makes its money with&#xa0;its other products — particularly cancer treatments — and analysts expect a rise in sales and earnings per share from the third quarter last year. </p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>This week's economic schedule features US and Chinese inflation data, Japan has GDP figures out, as does the UK — where quarterly and monthly figures are expected to paint <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e84a0e6-a893-42cf-8719-2e54c9477314\">contradictory pictures</a> of the recovery from coronavirus — trade figures and the Zew survey from Germany, Australian job numbers plus another round of central bankers making speeches.</p> <p>Personally, I would rather hear your views, not on the economic outlook, but what you think about this newsletter.
