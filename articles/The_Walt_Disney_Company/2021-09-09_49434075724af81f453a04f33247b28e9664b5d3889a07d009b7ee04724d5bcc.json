  "text": "<h2>Frozen</h2> <h4>THEATRE ROYAL DRURY LANE, LONDON</h4> <p>Step on to the Strand, central London, at around teatime these days and you will find yourself in the presence of royalty: dozens of little girls, kitted out in sparkly blue princess dresses, weaving their way towards the inspiration for their outfits — Elsa, the ice queen at the heart of <em>Frozen</em>.</p> <p>After a pandemic-enforced delay, the stage musical of Disney's 2013 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d81bfd2a-5da6-11e3-b3e8-00144feabdc0\">animated film</a> finally sweeps into town like a snowstorm, transforming the stage of the (gloriously) refurbished <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/789232ff-c70a-4bb4-8294-fc9d2ce72ff9\">Theatre Royal Drury Lane</a> into a glittering ice palace and putting girl power front and centre. For <em>Frozen</em>'s draw — apart from the earworm-inducing number <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/636ab7e0-2036-11e7-b7d3-163f5a7f229c\">“Let It Go”</a> — is its neat subversion of the classic fairytale, making sisterly love the force that saves the day.</p> <p>Written by Jennifer Lee, with music and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, the <em>Snow Queen</em>-inspired show tells the story of Elsa, a Nordic princess who has magical frosty powers she can't control. When she accidentally freezes her little sister, Anna, their parents decide to separate them. A rapprochement when Elsa becomes queen leads to disaster: Elsa ices over both her kingdom and her heart and retreats into cold seclusion; Anna tries to get through to her. Both are courageous and self-sacrificing and it's their deep love for one another that eventually thaws the spell.</p> <p>On stage, that message gains in potency from the live connection between actors and audience. Here, those mini <em>Frozen </em>devotees — male and female — are in the room with the two brave female characters but also with two galvanising female performances that reach across the stalls. Stephanie McKeon's lovely Anna radiates self-deprecating humour and warm affection: she's irresistibly smitten, turning cartwheels during her comic love duet, “Love Is an Open Door”, with Prince Hans (Oliver Ormson, wittily smooth). Samantha Barks's terrific Elsa conveys wells of suppressed pain beneath her chilly reserve and tears up the stage with her show-stopping delivery of “Let It Go”. “Wow!” whispered the little girl next to me as Barks strode to the footlights in a blizzard of crystals and dry ice.</p> <p>It's a winning combination of cool spectacle and relatable warmth. Christopher Oram's lovely designs channel storybook charm for the olde-worlde kingdom of Arendelle and a Swarovski catalogue for Elsa's palace. On stage, there is not the elasticity of animation, but you can make an audience of 2,000 gasp as your lonely heroine, in a dazzling moment of stage sorcery, casts off her frock and former self to emerge as a glistening icicle of a woman, while around her a frozen citadel of snowflake lattices and ice-blue depths engulf the stage (spectacular video work from Finn Ross).</p> <p>Michael Grandage's direction focuses on the human and the humorous: we first meet Elsa and Anna as two instantly recognisable, mischievous little girls. There's great, goofy humour from Craig Gallivan and his puppet as Olaf the Snowman and a delightful, nimble reindeer Sven (Ashley Birchall rotating with Mikayla Jade).</p> <p>But the stage also highlights shortcomings. There are several underused ideas, characters and plot lines: the comic number celebrating “Hygge” (one of many new inclusions), for instance, is fun but oddly unmoored; Hans's devious plan arrives with all the subtlety of a snowplough; there's very little sense of real jeopardy. And the main plot, even expanded for stage, feels choppy. It touches on significant themes, such as loneliness, self-doubt and gender expectations, without digging into them, which limits the emotional journeys of the two lead characters — particularly Elsa — and rushes the ending. There is also the bigger question of theatres filling their stages with transplants of successful movies.</p> <p>But most objections melt under the force of scintillating theatre wizardry. Drawbacks aside, this is a joyously delivered story of the transformative power of love, and an introduction for many young <em>Frozen</em> fans to the magic of live theatre.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>Booking to June 2022, </em><a href=\"http://www.frozenthemusical.co.uk\"><em>frozenthemusical.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Rockets and Blue Lights</h2> <h4>NATIONAL THEATRE, LONDON</h4> <p>A more far-reaching scrutiny of received narratives comes from Winsome Pinnock in her new play <em>Rockets and Blue Lights</em>, a rich, complex drama about slavery and its legacy today, at London's National Theatre (a co-production with Manchester's Royal Exchange).</p> <p>Key to the piece is JMW Turner's painting “The Slave Ship”, which depicts the horror of dead and dying slaves being thrown overboard. The play opens with two characters contemplating the painting: Essie (Rochelle Rose), a teacher trying to educate her class about this shameful episode in British history, and Lou (Kiza Deen), an actor starring in a film about the painting. “Why did he have to make something so ugly so beautiful?” asks Lou. That question runs through the play as it debates aestheticising black pain, white saviourism, representation and narrative control.</p> <p>Lou soon finds herself at odds with her director when the script is rewritten to reduce her character, an African woman, and make Turner the centre of the film: the white man in focus, the black stories relegated to the background. Arguments about this interweave with a 19th-century story about Thomas (Karl Collins) and his wife Lucy (Rose), who are now free but deeply scarred by their experiences. As the scenes bleed into each other, Pinnock blurs the edges between the narratives. Are we watching Turner or his film counterpart? How much is true? Who gets to choose?</p> <p>Water gradually seeps across Laura Hopkins' simple wooden deck set, just as the past seeps into the present, and director Miranda Cromwell nimbly layers scenes on top of one another while her fine cast slip skilfully from one role to another, finding parallels between the two worlds.</p> <p>It is intentionally not a “well-made play” with an easily digested narrative; rather, Pinnock asks how you depict the horror of slavery, how its legacy still shapes narratives and determines the perspective of those watching. The drama's very complexity undermines it in some ways, however: there are some clunky passages of dialogue, the school plotline in particular is underdeveloped, and characters remain sketchy. But this is a restless, sophisticated piece of work that asks serious questions about the role of art in relation to history.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>To October 9,</em> <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk\"><em>nationaltheatre.org.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act</h2> <h4>Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, London</h4> <p>Another horrific product of racism — South Africa's apartheid regime — drives playwright Athol Fugard's 1972 <em>Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act</em>. Fugard is brilliant at unpicking the obscene dehumanising details of the system. Here, the law against interracial sex claws into the love affair between Errol (black) and Frieda (white), exposing their most intimate moments to public censure.</p> <p>Diane Page's excellent revival at the Orange Tree makes us all voyeurs. We're seated around Niall McKeever's set, a dark sunken hollow at the centre of the stage, which begins as a refuge for the two lovers and gradually takes on more sinister qualities — a hiding place, a pit of despair. The two tiptoe round this, their talk sliding from idle chit-chat to far-reaching conversation about evolution and the vastness of time and to their divided lives. The juxtaposition is deliberate: Errol's fascination with millions of years of history contextualises the smallness of an ideology based on prejudice.</p> <p>Page meets this precision with a production that emphasises the physicality of the story. Scarlett Brookes and Shaq Taylor enter, half-dressed and gleaming with sweat, circling one another in a silent dance of desire. Their bodies are the source of both their joy and their despair: the very skin they caress will destroy their hope.</p> <p>The quiet sensuality of the first half contrasts starkly with the brittle nature of the second, as a white detective (Richard Sutton) boasts of catching the couple, naked, on camera. As their relationship is dissected in court, the scenes become short and splintered, Page's staging punctuated by harsh camera flashes, the two actors' body language broken and bewildered. A fine revival of sharp, shocking play.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>To October 2; livestreamed September 23 and 24, on demand October 5-8, </em><a href=\"http://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk\"><em>orangetreetheatre.co.uk</em></a></p><p>Source: Sarah Hemming 2021 'Frozen stage musical combines icy spectacle with human warmth' FT.com 9 September.
