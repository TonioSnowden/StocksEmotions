  "text": "<p>First, the oh-so-perfectly titled \"Murderbot Diaries.\" In Martha Wells's series a cyborg security agent has managed to hack his own systems, thereby freeing himself from being compelled to follow orders. But instead of going on a homicidal spree and revenging himself on the race responsible for his enslavement, Murderbot watches TV. A lot of TV. He loves hokey narrative storylines and yet is incredibly uncomfortable interacting with real humans in real life—even the good guys who agree to keep his secret. Because he might need to murder them. This future is full of bad acronyms and portmanteaus, alien planets, evil corporations and even worse governments. It's all one poor broken Murderbot can do just to find his own way through the universe. \"All Systems Red\" is the first of six books (plus two short stories) that go down like candy.</p><p>Are you reading the Expanse series yet? If not, why not? This is the space opera you need right now. The nine main books follow Earther James Holden and his hearty crew as they navigate the politics and railguns of a not-too-distant future. Mars, Earth, and \"beltalowda\"—asteroid-belt inhabitants—all jockey for positions of power in the new space race. There are aliens, some actual science, and fun characters. There is also a television show. But it's the clever dialogue, worldbuilding, and space fights that make it so easy to sink into the universe of the Expanse and wish you didn't have to leave it for the real world. The latest book in the series is \"Memory's Legion,\" a collection of shorts, one of which follows my favorite storyline: the creation of the Epstein Drive, the engine all the ships use. James S.A. Corey is the pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck—the latter of whom was an assistant to George R.R. Martin. Did I just blow your mind?</p><p>Many speculative fiction stories have plumbed the deep and unsettling ramifications of what happens when you upload a personality/intelligence/soul into the cloud (and sometimes beam it back down). Is the digital person the same as the one in the original \"meat\" body? What if there are two copies? More? Are they the same people? Do they all share one soul? The Bobiverse series of books has an intriguing answer to all that: Who cares. Space is cool! \"We Are Legion (We Are Bob)\" tells the story of sci-fi nerd Robert Johansson, who becomes one of the few successful human-to-spaceship-brain transfers in a grim future of religious extremism and the end of most life on earth. But that's ok, because Bob has a plan. And the first part of his plan involves splitting off more versions of himself, because more Bobs mean more space exploration! More habitable planets! More aliens! And, most importantly, more Bobs. Many of the Bobs are also sci-fi nerds who choose avatars from—and endlessly joke about—Star Trek, Star Wars and other beloved SF creations. Dennis E. Taylor has written four books in the Bobiverse series thus far—\"Heaven's River\" is the latest—and if you aren't giggling to yourself during some of the Bobversations, you need more winter vacation time.</p><p>15 Books We Read This Week</p><p>The soul of Dickens's Christmas classic, Roald Dahl's outrageous genius, the man who transformed ballet, science-fiction escapes and more.</p><p>What if Jessica Fletcher from the television show \"Murder, She Wrote\" finally realized that all the murders around her happened because of her, and then to stop them she fled . . . into space? That's more or less the premise of \"Station Eternity (The Midsolar Murders)\" by Mur Lafferty. The murders and their mysteries have made Mallory Viridian's life on earth an utter mess so she takes up residence as a hardcore expat on the sentient Space Station Eternity. There she is reluctantly allowed to exist on the fringe by alien races who have just first-contacted earth and don't really want anything to do with us. The only other humans on the station are the sociopathic human ambassador and a man fleeing arrest. Their lives are small, sad and often uncomfortable until a shuttle full of humans suddenly arrives. Murder inevitably occurs, the victims including the \"symbiont\" bonded to the station itself. Mallory now has one hell of a mystery to solve, with the stakes including nothing less than interstellar peace.</p><p>If you haven't read \"Old Man's War\" by John Scalzi of course you should, but this holiday season you should also read his \"The Kaiju Preservation Society.\" In a post-Covid gig economy the hero Jamie is a \"deliverator\" for \"füdmüd,\" a Seamless-like company, until he's offered a job at a research station on an alternate earth. There is his main task is to \"lift things,\" but his knack for acting quickly in dangerous situations, producing snappy comeback lines and keeping two steps ahead of the bad guys swiftly elevates him to hero status. His employers study and really do try to preserve the organic, nuclear-powered kaiju: giant creatures that live on that other earth and look like something out of a Japanese monster movie. Unfortunately, evil corporations want to steal their genetic material for weapons. Worse: An overloading kaiju can sometimes explode into our universe. Or at least Canada. A fun read that will have you stomping around the decked halls of your house: RWAR!!</p><p>So happy holidays—and may the sour cream on your latkes or that fruitcake from your great-aunt be the only heavy things you have to dig into for the rest of the year.</p><p>Science Fiction and Fantasy: Taking a Break From the Present</p>",
