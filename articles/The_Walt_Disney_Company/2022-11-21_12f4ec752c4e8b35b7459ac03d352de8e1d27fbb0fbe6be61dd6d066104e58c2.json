  "title": "U.S. News:  Trump GOP Rivals Edge Into Spotlight  ----  By Alex Leary",
  "text": "<p>   LAS VEGAS -- A roster of potential candidates effectively opened the race for the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nomination over the weekend, testing campaign themes and seeking to distinguish themselves from former President Donald Trump. </p><p>   The Republican Jewish Coalition gathering here concluded a weighty week for the GOP, after underwhelming midterm election results secured a narrow House majority but also triggered friction over Mr. Trump's role. The former president, denying culpability, said Tuesday that he would seek the nomination. </p><p>   Mr. Trump addressed the crowd of 850 Saturday afternoon via satellite from Florida and received a standing ovation. But the event at the Venetian resort served as the first major platform for others seeking to capitalize on a growing appetite for someone else. They included former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Some huddled privately with donors. </p><p>   No one generated more excitement than Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had the prime-time speaking slot Saturday and walked on stage to a reception unmatched by others. </p><p>   \"Florida really has a blueprint for success,\" said Mr. DeSantis, whose resounding re-election victory strengthened his position as the leading alternative to Mr. Trump. He highlighted his rejection of Covid-19 policies and fight with Walt Disney Co. \"We've got a lot more to do and I have only begun to fight.\" </p><p>   The speakers -- including Mr. Trump -- generally shared agreement on Republican policies: more domestic energy production, less regulation and taxes, a crackdown on crime and more border security. Some said the disappointments over weak midterms results shouldn't obscure the successes. </p><p>   \"Some of you may be sad but don't be sad when it comes to the House,\" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, who is poised to become speaker of the new Congress. He cited GOP gains in Democratic strongholds such as New York and the addition of new Black and Latino members. </p><p>   Few others have gone as far as Mr. Trump in signaling an intention to run. But the jostling among potential presidential candidates shows the former president won't have a clear field, despite an early announcement designed to scare off rivals and lock down supporters. </p><p>   \"If there are multiple candidates, Trump will win hands down,\" said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush. \"If it's only one or two bona-fide outsider conservatives, it's a fair fight and Trump could lose it.\" </p><p>   Party luminaries walked a fine line over the Friday-through-Saturday event, seeking to highlight Mr. Trump's shortcomings without alienating his supporters. Prospective candidates credited the former president's accomplishments, many highlighting his decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. </p><p>   But speakers also made unmistakable attempts to draw contrasts. Some suggested the party must move on from a phase marked by controversy, weak candidates and a string of electoral losses. That echoed sentiment expressed in recent days by other elected Republicans, party activists and donors. </p><p>   \"We have to have this family argument and we need to have it now,\" said Mr. Christie. </p><p>   Mr. Pence headlined the event Friday night and signed copies of his new memoir, which details his rebuffing of Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure him to block the congressional certification of President Biden's 2020 victory. </p><p>   Mr. Pompeo stirred attention ahead of his Friday night speech by tweeting in apparent reference to Mr. Trump: \"We were told we'd get tired of winning. But I'm tired of losing. And so are most Republicans.\" </p><p>   While Mr. Trump has a strong grass-roots fundraising operation, some major donors have said they would no longer support him. Miriam Adelson, the wife of the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who contributed millions in support of the former president, will stay neutral in the primary, an aide said. </p><p></p>",
