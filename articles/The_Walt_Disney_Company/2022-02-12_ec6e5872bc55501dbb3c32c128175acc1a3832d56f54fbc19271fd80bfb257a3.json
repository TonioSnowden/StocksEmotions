I am 4,500km from sunny Los Angeles, where the town is abuzz with pre-festivities for this Sunday's Super Bowl. Los Angeles is both hosting the game and the home to the <strong>Rams</strong>, who will face off against the <strong>Cincinnati Bengals</strong> for the <strong>NFL</strong>'s big trophy. I'm told it's a big deal out there.</p> <p>Still, media and advertising executives in New York are paying attention because the <strong>Super Bowl</strong> is the biggest event in US television. It is no exaggeration to say that sports, and specifically football, are the sole bright spot in the slowly decaying corpse that is America's traditional television business. Even as millions more Americans cancel their television packages every year, NFL ratings have actually increased this season, averaging 17m viewers per game — the highest level in six years. </p> <p>Americans are set to wager $7.6bn on Sunday's Super Bowl, the <strong>American Gaming Association</strong> predicts. Others, like myself, will instead be tuning in for a nostalgic halftime show performance featuring 90s hip hop stars <strong>Dr Dre</strong> and <strong>Mary J Blige</strong>. All of this is good news for <strong>NBC</strong>, which will air the game, and the advertisers that have paid as much as $7mn for 30 seconds of airtime to promote beer (or this year, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/metas-super-bowl-ad-leans-on-an-animatronic-dog-to-promote-metaverse-11644503400\">metaverse</a>). This Sunday could end up being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/281aeae8-b292-4f35-9d8c-b3cf5cdeb6ef\">“the highest-revenue day in US sports media history”</a>.</p> <p>In Scoreboard this week, we explore the priorities behind <strong>China</strong>‘s sports marketing soft power machine, the growing sponsorship appeal of <strong>Formula One</strong>, and the turmoil at <strong>Peloton</strong>. Do read on — <em>Anna Nicolaou, US media correspondent</em></p> <h1>How to become a sports superstar in China</h1> <p>One week into the <strong>Beijing Olympics</strong>, it is indisputably clear that <strong>Eileen Gu</strong> is the face of the Games. Born and raised in the US and having elected to compete for her mother's native China, Gu clinched her first gold medal in the women's freeskiing big air event on Tuesday, with favoured prospects in both the slopestyle and half-pipe events this week.</p> <p>Like tennis star and Tokyo Olympic cauldron lighter <strong>Naomi Osaka </strong>before her, Gu is a woman at the top of her sport who transcends two cultures. They have both attracted impressive rosters of blue-chip corporate sponsors, from <strong>Nike </strong>and <strong>Nissin Foods</strong> in Osaka's case to <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>Bank of China </strong>for Gu. </p> <p>But this is where the similarities end. Unlike Osaka, who is known for her wry humour and willingness to speak her mind, Gu is the definition of polished. After her gold medal run in big air, she answered questions in both English and Mandarin with nearly carbon copy syntax — deftly skirting questions about her citizenship and offering platitudes on the presence of&#xa0; <strong>Peng Shuai </strong>in the audience.</p> <p>The most marketable stars of the Beijing Games are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ead1b26f-c060-4d54-aebd-5ebde5c5924a\">courteous, gracious, and unfailingly uncontroversial</a>. <strong>Nathan Chen</strong>, the American gold medallist in men's figure skating on Thursday, counts top Olympic sponsors <strong>Panasonic</strong>, <strong>Bridgestone</strong> and <strong>Toyota </strong>among his backers and says he likes “to keep things bottled up” .</p> <p>Gold medallists like Gu and Chen are likely to see their endorsement portfolios balloon in coming weeks, with <em>Forbes</em> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinbirnbaum/2022/02/03/heres-how-much-olympic-figure-skating-star-nathan-chen-is-making-from-endorsements/?sh=683dfbee2ae2\">estimating</a> that Chen had at least $1mn in guaranteed payouts leading up to Beijing. In Gu's case, by electing to represent China she is jumping into a market with relatively little competition for big endorsements.</p> <p><strong>Mark Tanner</strong>, managing director at Shanghai-based agency <strong>China Skinny</strong>, said there was a “deficit of world-class athletes in China” in a market where there is huge demand for sponsorship. At the same time, he suggested consumers in China now had higher expectations of a sports star to have awareness of the country and its tastes.</p> <p>“It's no longer the case that you come in blowing your foreign brand trumpet,” he said.<br><br>It's not unusual for an Olympic host nation to lure foreign-born athletes of native descent to compete for the home team, as Greece did the same for a proportion of its 2004 Olympics team. But Gu represents more than just a sporting victory for China: she's the clearest glimpse yet of the nation's soft power ideals.</p> <h1>The $500mn benefit of Formula One victory</h1> <p><strong>Max Verstappen</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.explained-understanding-one-of-the-most-chaotic-controversial-title.4B98awxwP7JPgBWxIt5KnL.html\">controversial title win </a>against seven-time world champion <strong>Lewis Hamilton </strong>on the final day of the <strong>Formula One </strong>season in Abu Dhabi came at a price. </p> <p>In F1, there are two championships: the driver's title and the team-based gong. The former carries much of the glory but the latter determines the allocation of the prize money.</p> <p>So even though <strong>Red Bull</strong>'s Verstappen won the driver's championship, Hamilton's <strong>Mercedes</strong> took the undisclosed sum for finishing first in the constructor's standings. </p> <p>But building the winning car still benefits Red Bull indirectly. This week, the team revealed that <strong>Oracle</strong>, the US technology company co-founded by <strong>Larry Ellison</strong>, will <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-and-red-bull-racing-launch-a-new-chapter-of-innovation-in-formula-one-2022-02-09/\">upgrade its partnership</a> to become its title sponsor. </p> <p>Two people with knowledge of the deal told Scoreboard the value of the sponsorship is between $300mn and $500mn over five years. Either way, that's a fair whack of cash coming Red Bull's way.</p> <p>Commercial partners are flocking to F1 after a championship that went to the wire, the series' successful appeal to new fans through <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a794fb5-3bcc-412d-afe6-0db9389b24eb\">Netflix documentary</a> <em>Drive to Survive</em>, which has been credited with attracting a younger audience, and its subsequent growth in the US, where the series is set to expand with races in Miami and Las Vegas.</p> <p>Similarly, <strong>Aston Martin</strong>, the rival team controlled by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d8d103e-6120-41c5-942a-95376c60f834\">Canadian billionaire <strong>Lawrence Stroll</strong></a>, signed a major partnership with Saudi state oil company <strong>Aramco </strong>earlier this month, <strong>Ferrari </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.racefans.net/2021/12/21/santander-rejoins-ferrari-as-sponsor-in-multi-year-deal/\">lured Spanish bank <strong>Santander</strong></a> back to the show, and F1 itself last year signed a $30m-a-year sponsorship with <strong>Crypto.com</strong>.</p> <p>But for Red Bull, the money will arrive at a critical time. The team, which is controlled by Austrian billionaire <strong>Dietrich Mateschitz</strong>, cofounder of the energy drink company, has historically relied on external engine providers, unlike Mercedes and Ferrari, its main rivals.</p> <p>In a major strategic step, Red Bull has set up a new <strong>Powertrains</strong> division that will transform it into an engine maker. The move comes after Honda, which has provided power to the team since 2019, declared its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba229a8b-082b-41a7-84ff-25bd556f598a\">intention to leave</a> the sport.</p> <p>As well as boosting on-track performance, Oracle is working with Red Bull on the development of Powertrains, with F1 planning to introduce a new generation of engines in 2026. </p> <p>That would propel the team into the ranks of the sport's power unit suppliers, alongside its biggest competitors, and eliminate its dependency on outside providers. The stakes are high for the team: becoming a fully fledged engine manufacturer would put Red Bull firmly in control of its own destiny but failure would be costly.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals are set to compete on Sunday in the Super Bowl, the biggest game in the US National Football League, but the spectacle has been overshadowed by a racism scandal off the field of play.

Activist investor <strong>Blackwells Capital </strong>is pushing for a sale after Peloton co-founder <strong>John Foley</strong> said he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33c8306c-abad-41f6-874f-e95bb23c6460\">step down</a> as chief executive.</p></li>  <li><p>The NFL's <strong>Washington Commanders</strong>, which changed its name to remove a racial slur, has endured a bumpy rebranding exercise after commercial partners pressured for change.
