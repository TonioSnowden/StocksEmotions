  "text": "<p>China is taking stringent measures to contain pockets of the coronavirus in the country, recording 48 domestic cases on Saturday across several provinces. Though extremely low compared with countries that are moving to live with the virus, the outbreak has prompted business closures and mass testingin certain areas.</p><p>The world's most populous nation has committed to maintaining \"zero tolerance\" for the virus despite criticism from business groups, a close to 80% vaccination rate, and a world which is gradually learning to live with Covid-19.</p><p>The Shanghai theme park had been celebrating its fifth anniversary through most of October with Halloween-themed exhibitions such as a Disney villain balcony walk and \"Donald's Halloween Treat Cavalcade.\"</p><p>Videos shared by guests on social media showed swarms of people—many dressed up in Halloween costumes—queuing up for tests before they could leave. One showed the Disney evening fireworks erupting behind workers in hazmat suits conducting tests for park visitors.</p><p>\"I never thought that the longest queue in Disneyland would be for a nucleic acid test,\" one visitor said on social media.</p><p>The testing requirements were triggered after a woman who had visited the park on Saturday found out she was a close contact of a confirmed case. The woman was on her way home by train but stopped en route in eastern Hangzhou upon realizing that she could have been exposed to the virus. She tested positive in Hangzhou early Sunday, according to information released on government social-media accounts.</p><p>Tourists traveling between cities and provinces have hastened the spread of the virus. A retired couple from Shanghai who was on a cross-country trip tested positive for the virus on Oct. 17. The former university professors had undergone a routine test to enter the terra-cotta warrior museum in Xi'an.</p><p>Cases have since been tracked to multiple regions, including the capital. The Beijing marathon, slated for Sunday, was also canceled.</p><p>Shanghai Disneyland said it would refund tickets and notify guests as soon as there was a confirmed date for resumption of activities. Guests who visited the park over the weekend would have to isolate for two days, and be tested for Covid-19 several times over the next two weeks. The park is 57%-owned by a state-backed consortium, Shanghai Shendi, and 43% by Walt Disney Co.</p><p>Zhao Yueling contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com</p><p>Shanghai Disneyland Suspends Operations as Visitors Queue for Covid-19 Tests Before Exiting</p>",
