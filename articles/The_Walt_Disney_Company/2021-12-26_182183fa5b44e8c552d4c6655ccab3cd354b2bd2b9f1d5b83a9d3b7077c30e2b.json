  "text": "<p>Broadcast television changed when cable expanded beyond the delivery of a good wireless signal. An explosion in delivery methods plus marketing analytics proliferated commercial enterprises. Appetites have been spawned that cannot be satisfied easily. Maybe this dynamic helps explain why family members seldom gather for supper.</p><p>Carl Eifert</p><p>Alexandria, Va.</p><p>Disney, Netflix and Amazon are re-creating aspects of the 1940s, when studios owned and controlled both production and exhibition. Some harbingers of the future are the pervasiveness of series, which cost less per hour of screen time than theatrical movies, and indie directors' difficulty piercing the streaming oligopoly.</p><p>A striking difference between then and now is that streaming services have vastly more information than the talent does about the performance of a film. By not disclosing some information, they can enhance their bargaining power versus the creative team. In 1949 the Supreme Court separated production from exhibition. Maybe we need to rethink the current model as well.</p><p>Prof. S. Abraham Ravid</p><p>Yeshiva University</p><p>New York</p><p>Ms. Noonan doesn't mention the reasons I don't go to movie theaters anymore: Audience members talking on cellphones, kids crying and bored, kicking seats in front of them, filthy and sticky floors, seats and arm rests, poorly maintained restrooms, uninterested staff, exorbitantly priced \"snacks,\" endless previews. All this we should endure when we know we can see the movie in peace at home? Puh-lease!</p><p>Ann Saibeni</p><p>Sacramento, Calif.</p><p>Noonan on Theaters and How Movies Have Changed</p>",
