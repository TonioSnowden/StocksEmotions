  "title": "Disney CEO reverses course and opposes Florida's ‘Don't Say Gay' bill",
  "text": "<p>Facing a growing outcry from employees, Walt Disney chief executive Bob Chapek has reversed course by publicly voicing his opposition to a bill in Florida that has been dubbed the “Don't Say Gay” law.</p> <p>The decision to sign formally a statement condemning the bill, published by Chapek at the Disney shareholder meeting on Wednesday, comes just two days after he sent a 900-word memo outlining why the company would not publicly oppose it. “Corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds,” he wrote. </p> <p>But the memo only inflamed criticism, with the Animation Guild describing it as a “momentous mis-step”. </p> <p>Chapek's predecessor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertIger/status/1497064238145171458\">Bob Iger</a>, criticised the bill last month on Twitter, while Abigail Disney — granddaughter of a Disney co-founder and a vocal critic of the company's policies — said she was “deeply angered” by its refusal to criticise the Florida legislation.</p> <p>The blowback marks Chapek's first public relations mis-step since he took over fully after Iger's retirement at the end of last year. It is also an early test for Geoff Morrell, the company's new head of corporate affairs.</p> <p>Chapek told shareholders that the company had always opposed the legislation but had chosen to work “behind the scenes” to persuade lawmakers not to pass it. After “weeks of effort”, the company was “ultimately unsuccessful”, he conceded.</p> <p>“I understand our political approach, no matter how well intentioned, didn't quite get the job done,” he said.</p> <p>Chapek said he had spoken with Ron DeSantis, Florida's governor, who had agreed to meet him and some of Disney's LGBTQ+ employees in the state, which is home to the Walt Disney World resort. With about 65,000 employees in the state, Disney is one of Florida's biggest private employers and carries significant political weight.</p> <p>His earlier memo said that the company's best chance of bringing about change was “through the inspiring content we produce” and that its ability to do so “would be diminished if [we] were to become a political football in any debate”. </p> <p>The Florida bill, which is aimed at curbing discussions in schools about sexual orientation and gender identity among children aged nine and younger, was passed by the Florida state legislature on Tuesday. Officially known as the Parental Rights in Education act, it will require DeSantis's signature to become law. </p> <p>Activists have criticised Disney for contributing to politicians who have subsequently supported the legislation. Chapek appeared to nod to such concerns by pledging to reassess&#xa0;Disney's “approach to advocacy — including political giving in Florida and beyond”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Chapek said Disney will also sign the Human Rights Campaign's statement opposing such legislative efforts around the US and donate $5mn towards groups working to protect LGBTQ+ rights. </p> <p>Joni Madison, interim president of the Human Rights Campaign, said the group would refuse the donation from Disney until it saw more evidence that the company was&#xa0;working with LGBTQ+ advocates to block or overturn&#xa0;“dangerous proposals”.</p> <p>“Today they took a step in the right direction,” Madison said. “But it was merely the first step.”</p> <p>Disney is not the first Hollywood company to draw fire from employees over issues facing the LGBTQ+ community. In October Netflix employees <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55b0d438-84cf-429e-b017-34208f77bdd7\">walked out</a> over&#xa0;a stand-up special by comedian Dave Chappelle in which he made mocking references to transgender people.</p> <p>Lawmakers in Georgia this week introduced a bill similar to Florida's. Disney has filmed many of its big-budget Marvel movies in the state and, under Iger's leadership, had warned in 2019 it would be difficult to keep filming there if the state passed a controversial “heartbeat” abortion law, which was ultimately struck down.</p><p>Source: Peter Wells in New York and Christopher Grimes in Los Angeles  2022 'Disney CEO reverses course and opposes Florida's ‘Don't Say Gay' bill' FT.com 10 March.
