  "text": "<p>Bob Chapek recently wrote to colleagues in an internal memo that Disney would have to cut staff to cope with the deteriorating media environment. Little did he know he would himself become a victim.</p> <p>On Sunday, Disney announced the board had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22a99fef-d5b8-4ad3-8251-9b4918d7c6c9\">fired Chapek</a> and brought back the legendary Bob Iger as chief executive. Chapek only replaced Iger in early 2020. </p> <p>Wall Street has learned that the pricey and cut-throat streaming business — in which Disney has invested heavily — can no longer count on user growth. The moment of truth was when Netflix announced in April that it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70a28358-8720-4f36-a5b4-24dc0f3be9a3\">bled subscribers</a> for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>Disney has since been weighed down by two inexorable problems, despite a franchise portfolio that includes <em>Star Wars</em> and a gaggle of cartoon princesses. Its direct-to-consumer business, led by Disney Plus, lost $4bn in the recently concluded fiscal year. That was despite boasting 200mn streaming subscribers overall.</p> <p>At the same, Disney's traditionally profitable broadcast and cable networks face accelerated cord-cutting and surging costs for sports rights. For 2022, profits in that business were only flat for the year.</p> <p>Ironically, Disney's best business of theme parks, formerly run by Chapek, made healthy earnings. These have subsidised the ambitions of the rest of the company.</p> <p>Disney shares have fallen more than 40 per cent this year, worse than rivals Comcast and Paramount. Warner Brothers Discovery is down more than 50 per cent, but it suffers from a crushing debt load and a messy merger integration.</p> <p>Activist investor Dan Loeb recently took a stake in Disney and suggested the company continue to halt its dividend and use the cash to pay down debt and buy back shares. He also floated the idea of separating the crown jewel, ESPN. That way, the cash cow sports network and the Hollywood assets can each get their respective, appropriate valuation multiple.</p> <p>A Loeb representative has joined the board, but Disney has demurred on any radical changes.</p> <p>Questions around the best structure for Disney are now Iger's to answer. He has agreed to a two-year term. His halo of managerial brilliance will reassure shareholders for a short while. Shares of Disney were up six per cent on Monday. But he holds no magic and can create no fairytale ending — particularly for the cost-heavy streaming business.</p> <p><em>This article was amended after publication to clarify that Disney had already halted dividends at the point when Dan Loeb called for a continued suspension.</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Disney: return of the Jedi brings a new hope — temporarily' FT.com 21 November.
