  "title": "How Do You Make a Hit Halloween Costume? A Lot of Data and a Little Bit of Luck; Retailers and licensers have been crunching numbers and eyeing social trends to predict the most popular looks. But every spooky season brings new surprises.",
  "text": "<p>\"There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things that may be presented and reviewed, and you start to whittle down what you think actually has commercial opportunity,\" said Jeremy Padawer, chief brand officer of Jazwares LLC, one of the country's largest toy and costume manufacturers.</p><p>In recent years, the costume industry has moved away from generic staples (sexy cats, spooky witches) toward specific and detailed pop-culture references, said Ed LaBay, executive vice president of merchandise and marketing for Hot Topic.</p><p>\"Traditional Halloween looks that have historically been great, like angel wings, fairy wings and even things that align themselves well with current trends—we've definitely seen that take a back seat,\" Mr. LaBay said.</p><p>In their place, costumes based on intellectual property have flourished, but predicting which ones will sell requires extensive research, makers say. That entails buzzy TV shows and blockbuster movies, viral memes, social trends, YouTube videos and even fandom conversations on platforms like Reddit and Discord. Several retailers and production companies said some of their most popular costumes this season were the trio of witches from \"Hocus Pocus,\" Harley Quinn, the Batman (as in Robert Pattinson) and characters from \"Stranger Things,\" as well as figures from classic horror films such as Jason and Michael Myers.</p><p>But there's always an element of unpredictability. Who, for instance, could have foreseen how \"Squid Game\" would take over the world last year—and therefore Halloween?</p><p>\"It's a lot of data. It's a lot of analysis and historics of what has worked, what hasn't worked,\" said Robert Oberschelp, senior vice president of franchise management, marketing and brand product for Warner Bros. Discovery Global Brands and Experiences. \"But there's also times where it's also a gut, 'This is going to be strong.'\" (Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of HBO, whose shows include \"Game of Thrones\" and \"House of the Dragon,\" both of which have their own significant merchandise lines.)</p><p>In response to the overwhelming popularity of \"Squid Game,\" Josh Simon, vice president of consumer products at Netflix, said his team created clothing with the show's logo and uniform numbers, a reference to the show's characters, within a week of the show blowing up last fall. But the costumes that proliferated after the show's release were primarily homemade or sold by unofficial manufacturers.</p><p>Mr. Oberschelp said his team predicted that \"Space Jam\" costumes would do well last Halloween, following the release of the 1996 film's stand-alone sequel, \"Space Jam: A New Legacy.\" They were right.</p><p>\"It's one that, in my opinion, will be a two- to three-year kind of run,\" Mr. Oberschelp said of \"Space Jam\" costumes. \"Then won't pop back up for another 15 years, when it becomes 'near-vintage.'\"</p><p>Spirit Halloween saw similar success since launching their \"Hocus Pocus\" line in 2017, said Holly Rawlinson, the company's vice president of licensing and business development. The movie, a Disney comedy about three witches released in 1993, hit several of the company's criteria: It had interesting costumes, a dedicated fan base, a nostalgia factor and longevity, with many people returning to the film—which released a sequel this year—every Halloween season. The retailer also became the first to secure an official license to create merchandise for Fortnite, the online videogame, after their trendspotting team noticed a surge in interest on social media.</p><p>\"One of the best indications of how viable a costume will be, especially for niche and retro brands, is how many consumers are already creating their own look,\" Ms. Rawlinson said in an email, adding that the company watches the DIY scene through social media and fan conventions such as Comic Con. \"This is especially true for classic brands, entertainment from the '80s or '90s, vintage videogames and more.\"</p><p>Mall retailer Hot Topic, which carries a range of pop-culture merchandise, is often looped into talks with production companies as soon as a new film or TV show is greenlighted by a studio. Typically, producers present pitches to the retailer with details such as costume shots and concept art, which retailers then use to brainstorm what might resonate most with fans using all criteria—from rating and target demographic to how easily a character's look might be replicated.</p><p>From there, costumes go through several rounds of evolutions before being completed and hitting the shelves. The ideal timeline from inception to sales is between one and two years, several retailers said. It's a complicated process, even for existing TV shows and film franchises.</p><p>\"We've got a view into all the major content into 2023 across all major streamers,\" said Steve Vranes, CEO of Hot Topic. \"They want us thinking about this with them.\"</p><p>Warner Bros. typically plans costumes and merchandise as far as two years in advance, Mr. Oberschelp said, though if a character suddenly spikes in demand, studios may commission costumes with a simple printed design before rolling out more elaborate versions the next season. The popularity of \"Ted Lasso,\" the hit Apple TV+ show about an American coaching an English soccer team, took Warner Bros. by surprise, he said. To meet fan demand, the retail team had to quickly create shirts with images of the team's jerseys on them. This year, the company rolled out real jerseys for fans to incorporate into their Halloween looks.</p><p>\"We're constantly watching what content the fans are watching—what shows are going up, what shows are going down,\" Mr. Oberschelp said.</p><p>Retailers are always looking for specific character elements that fans can re-create or incorporate into everyday looks. \"Daddy's Lil Monster\" tees, as seen on Harley Quinn, have taken off. At Hot Topic, \"Hellfire Club\" raglan tees inspired by \"Stranger Things\" sold more than 10 times as many units as the retailer expected, Mr. LaBay said. The company, after years of analyzing sales trends, identifying distinctive costumes and debating which characters fans would love most, had tapped into the right detail from the show.</p><p>\"It's an art and a science,\" Mr. Oberschelp, of Warner Bros. Discovery, said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's the big Halloween costume in your community this year?</p><p>How Do You Make a Hit Halloween Costume?
