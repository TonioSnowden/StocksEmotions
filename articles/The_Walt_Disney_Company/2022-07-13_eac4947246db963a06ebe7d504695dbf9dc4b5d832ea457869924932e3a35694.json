  "title": "Business News: Disney+ Lands Deal With BTS",
  "text": "<p>BTS would star in at least two of the titles: a concert film, \"BTS: Permission to Dance on Stage -- LA\" and a documentary series, \"BTS Monuments: Beyond the Star,\" Disney said.</p><p>One of the band members, V, is also set to star with four of his friends on a travel reality show for Disney.</p><p>\"We can't wait to show you these shows,\" one of the band members said in a video released by Disney Monday.</p><p>The band said the concert film would \"soon be available\" and that the documentary would be released next year. The series would show \"how we have grown in the past years and the story of our music.\"</p><p>A Disney spokeswoman said Tuesday that the company didn't \"have exact timing for the series quite yet,\" but that the content would stream on Disney+ in countries outside the U.S. She said it was too soon to know if the titles would stream in the U.S. on Disney+ or Hulu, which the company owns a majority stake in. She didn't disclose financial details about the deal.</p><p>Representatives for the band didn't return requests for comment.</p><p>The South Korean band surprised fans last month when it said that its members would pursue solo work.</p><p>BTS has yet to say when its members would take time away from the group, but a person familiar with the matter said the band expected to eventually come back together.</p><p>A HYBE spokeswoman said the band would \"remain active as a group\" while its members worked on solo projects.</p><p>Park Ji-won, HYBE's chief executive, said that the deal marked the \"start of a long-term collaboration.\"</p><p>Disney said that the concert film was recorded in November in Los Angeles.</p><p>The partnership will offer a boost to Disney's streaming catalog. The company said in May it added subscribers to Disney+ in its most recent quarter, avoiding a slowdown that hurt rival Netflix Inc.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
