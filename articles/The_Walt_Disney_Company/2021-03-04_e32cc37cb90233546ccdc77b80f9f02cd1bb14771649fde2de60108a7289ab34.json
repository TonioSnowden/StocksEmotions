  "title": "Business News:  Disney to Close at Least 60  Stores, Focus on e-Commerce  ----  By R.T. Watson",
  "text": "<p>    Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday it will close at least 60 Disney Stores throughout North America this year. </p><p>   The company said it would focus more on e-commerce while reducing the number of bricks-and-mortar locations it operates. </p><p>   During the pandemic, consumers have increasingly shifted to purchasing more goods and services online as governments both in the U.S. and abroad implemented lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19. </p><p>   Some major retailers, especially those located in shopping malls, have suffered losses. </p><p>   Meanwhile, online retailers, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Target Corp, which has scaled up its e-commerce business, have seen their fortunes soar as consumers depend more on online shopping. </p><p>   The Commerce Department estimated that total e-commerce sales rose 32% to $791.7 billion in 2020, compared with the previous year. </p><p>   \"While consumer behavior has shifted toward online shopping, the global pandemic has changed what consumers expect from a retailer,\" said Stephanie Young, president of Disney's consumer products, games and publishing. </p><p>   Each of the Disney Stores slated to close experienced interruptions due to lockdowns, according to a Disney spokesperson. </p><p>   The company said it has about 300 stores world-wide but wouldn't disclose how many it owns in North America. </p><p>   With Disney's theme parks encountering disruptions and closures during the pandemic, sales of its merchandise at those locations have also suffered. </p><p>   Disney said that over the next year it would aim to improve its e-commerce platform and more fully integrate its online shopping experience with its Disney Parks mobile apps and social media. </p><p>   The company also said it plans to broaden its merchandise line with more emphasis on products that might appeal to adults, including apparel, streetwear, home products and collectibles. </p><p>   Disney has also expanded the company's digital footprint abroad. </p><p>   In November 2020, the company launched online stores in India, New Zealand and Australia. </p><p>   Last month, Disney's parks, experiences and products division reported a quarterly loss of $119 million, compared with a $2.5 billion profit during the same period the previous year. </p><p></p>",
