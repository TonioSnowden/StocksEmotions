  "title": "REVIEW --- Icons: Disney Knows Rococo --- The studio's beloved movies borrowed from an 18th-century French style of ornamental whimsy.",
  "text": "<p>The show focuses, above all, on the Rococo style popular in France from around 1730 to 1760. Breaking with earlier ideals of simplicity and grandeur, the rococo was exuberant, playful and highly ornamental. It was \"supposed to be fun,\" says the Met's Wolf Burchard, who curated the show. There was \"energy [and] wit . . . a very light style.\" The spirit of rococo influenced other genres as well: A bestselling novel of the time starred a talking sofa, while in a 1739 ballet, a magician transforms a lovelorn prince into a teapot.</p><p>Walt Disney had similar ideas. The exhibition includes animated shorts from the early 1930s in which clocks, watches and porcelain figures come to life. The Disney studio got increasingly serious about art history for the full-length 1950 feature \"Cinderella.\" Originally the story was to be set in the 18th century, but the period's elaborate costumes posed an animation challenge. The studio also worried that bewigged heroes would be hard for 1950s children to relate to, Mr. Burchard says.</p><p>Instead, the film evokes the Rococo revival of the mid-19th century, with details like Cinderella's richly ornamented but cracked mirror standing on a handsomely carved marble tabletop. When the fairy godmother waves her wand to transform Cinderella's dress, the preciseness of the animators' sparkles evoke the pointille dot patterns used in some Sevres porcelain, in which each dot \"had to be placed with absolute precision to ensure a convincing visual effect,\" Mr. Burchard writes in the exhibition catalog. The show includes an extensive selection of Sevres porcelain, including sculptures of children entranced by \"The Magic Lantern\" (circa 1760), a forerunner of the cinema.</p><p>For \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959), Eyvind Earle served as effective art director and filled the film with references to art history. The storybook that sets the scene recalls a French illuminated book from the 1410s, \"The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry.\" Tapestries were another important influence. When the heroine, Aurora, and her Prince dance in a forest, the landscape is deliberately flattened, allowing details like the bark of the trees to dominate the scene. The same kind of flattening can be seen in the Met's own flower-bedecked tapestry \"Shepherd and Shepherdess Making Music\" (ca. 1500-30).</p><p>Rococo reappears in \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991), one of the first in a series of hits known as the Disney Renaissance. Art director Brian McEntee wanted the film to reflect the \"lyrical quality\" of Rococo painters Jean-Honore Fragonard (1732-1806) and his mentor, Francois Boucher (1703-1770) -- not so much the wigs and ornamentation but the \"pastoral atmosphere, almost like a dance in paint form,\" as Mr. McEntee says in an interview for the catalog.</p><p>For the dance of Belle and her beloved Beast, the animators turned to the Hall of Mirrors, a dazzling 1680s gallery in the palace of Versailles, with a ceiling fresco depicting winged infants (\"putti\") in the manner of Boucher. \"Inspiring Walt Disney\" will feature the scene projected on a wall. As for the Beast's servants -- magically turned into a clock, a candlestick, a cup and a teapot -- the exhibition has plenty of their rococo antecedents, like a wall clock of gilt bronze that is almost 4 feet tall and wildly overdecorated with flowers, a bust and animal heads.</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Adapted by Disney, Rococo Was Not for Kids\" -- WSJ December 8, 2021)</p>",
