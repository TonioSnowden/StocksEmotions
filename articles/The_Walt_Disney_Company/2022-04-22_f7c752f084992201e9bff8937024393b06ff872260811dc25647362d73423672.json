  "title": "Florida Gov. DeSantis Signs Bill Stripping Disney of Special Tax Status; Republicans took aim at theme park owner after it opposed recent state law limiting teaching on gender and sexuality",
  "text": "<p>On Tuesday morning, Mr. DeSantis published a proclamation amending the legislature's weeklong special session to include a two-page bill that called for the elimination of all special benefits districts in Florida established before 1968 and not since renewed.</p><p>The language in the bill targeted six such districts—which are common in Florida and typically used to streamline property-tax collections, often in agricultural areas—most prominent among them the Reedy Creek Improvement District, some 27,000 acres near Orlando that includes Walt Disney World's theme parks, hotels, resorts and other attractions.</p><p>Reedy Creek was established in 1967 by the Florida Legislature at the request of Walt Disney himself, who wanted more control over the development of an East Coast version of the company's successful Disneyland amusement park in California.</p><p>For the last half-century, the district has allowed Disney to essentially govern itself in Florida. The company pays taxes and fees to the district, and in return the district manages a wide variety of services for Walt Disney World, including fire and emergency medical services, road maintenance, wastewater management and power generation.</p><p>The district also allows Disney to expand its real estate holdings without having to follow local building, planning or environmental codes. Disney pays property taxes to Orange and Osceola counties in Florida, and contracts with the Orange County sheriff's office for law enforcement at the resort.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Florida Gov.
