  "text": "<p>\"Paw Patrol\" costumes top the company's list of most popular Halloween kids costumes this year. Other hot-selling ones in the youth category include characters from the \"Justice League\" movie, Dorothy from the classic \"The Wizard of Oz\" and the ever-menacing Darth Vader from \"Star Wars\" franchise.</p><p>With adults, the biggest seller looks to be an inflatable T-Rex costume, which has become increasingly beloved because of its appearance in TikTok videos, according to Costumes.com merchandising director Rebecca Maas.</p><p>\"Social media helps sell a lot of costumes,\" she said.</p><p>Also popular in the adult category this year: Wonder Woman, Buddy the Elf from the \"Elf\"movie and Dorothy from \"The Wizard of Oz.\"</p><p>Maas noted that normally costumes of characters in recent hit movies play heavily into sales trends. But with a limited number of must-see pictures in 2022, that has allowed costumes of long-established characters to sell well, along with costumes that just have their own comical or other appeal (as in the inflatable T-Rex).</p><p>\"There wasn't a ton of newness\" in this year's list, said Maas.</p><p>Increasingly, costumes for pets have become popular during Halloween — and Costumes.com tracks sales trends in that category as well. This year's top seller for pets is the Bob character from the \"Minions\" franchise. Also trending in the pet category: Winifred from the \"Hocus Pocus\" movies and the Beetlejuice character of cinematic fame.</p><p>Costumes.com based this year's top 10 lists using current and historical sales figures, plus search trends, according to Maas.</p><p>The National Retail Federation says that Halloween spending is expected to reach a record $10.6 billion this year. Also of note: 47% of consumers plan to dress up in a costume, according to the federation.</p><p>The most popular Halloween costumes for kids, pets — and adults</p>",
