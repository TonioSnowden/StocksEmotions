  "text": "<p>Meet the world's oldest known garden gnome. At just under 6 inches high, in shades of terracotta and burnished scarlet, clutching a spade not much longer than a toothpick, the Lamport Gnome cuts a retiring figure, dwarfed even by a snowdrop.</p> <p>His very unobtrusiveness may be the secret of his survival. In 1903 he went missing for a full half-century, reputedly by falling down a rockery crevice while under heavy fire by the air-rifle-wielding daughters of his recently deceased owner.</p> <p>Sir Charles Isham, 10th Baronet, of Lamport Hall, Northamptonshire probably encountered <em>Gnomen-Figuren,</em> or “folklore figures”, used by miners as good-luck talismans, on a visit to Germany in 1847. In 1874, Isham brought home a set of 21 of his own from Nuremberg.</p> <p>They began their residency indoors, as placeholders on the family dining table, but were soon banished by his wife to the rockery, with its alpine plants and a “crystal cave” of quartz. </p> <p>His hand-illustrated treatise <em>Notes on Gnomes</em> credits the landscape designer John Claudius Loudon with first advocating the idea of introducing “lifelike diminutive figures into gardens” in England, and himself with its “first realisation at Lamport” — though different versions of the mythological humanoids had been deployed as protection from evil spirits since antiquity.</p> <p>Isham, who had been possessed by the mid-Victorian craze for fairies from the early 1860s, believed his miniature miners and blacksmiths came alive at night. He wrote out placards in doggerel verse interpreting his gnomic tableaux for the thousands of visitors to his annual fetes. He even moved his bedroom to the first floor overlooking the rockery, perhaps hoping for a glimpse of men at work.</p> <p>After Isham's disapproving daughters shot his tableaux to smithereens, the first world war killed off any nascent vogue the German gnome may have enjoyed. It was Disney's 1937 film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> that popularised them and led to suburban gardens filled with the jolly, lurid figurines we know today.</p> <p>In 2013, the Lamport Gnome appeared at the Chelsea Flower Show, which had lifted its ban on gnomes for its centenary year. But “gnomes have never been an aristocratic conceit”, says the landscape architect and historian Todd Longstaffe-Gowan. “Gnomes have always been associated with a strange fraternity of people with curious taste. They are just so . . . odd.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lamporthall.co.uk/\"><em>lamporthall.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Kate Worsley 2022 'The home in 50 objects from around the world #36: the Lamport Gnome' FT.com 8 July.
