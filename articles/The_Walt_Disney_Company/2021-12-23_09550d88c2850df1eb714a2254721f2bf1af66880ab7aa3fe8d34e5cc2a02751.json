  "title": "Fashion Designer Anna Sui on the Best Shampoo and the Death of 'Cool'; The New York City creative, who founded her fashion business in 1981, discusses her eclectic inspirations",
  "text": "<p>Having founded her eponymous label in 1981, Ms. Sui is one of the few independent designers still thriving in New York City, with an e-commerce fashion and beauty operation and bricks-and-mortar stores world-wide. As a gift for the holidays, in partnership with liquor brand St-Germain, she made a floral beaded bottle tote (pictured at her right in the portrait above). In her own experience, however, \"I don't think I would say the best [Christmas gifts] are material,\" Ms. Sui said. \"It's more being with my family. I'm really close to them.\"</p><p>In the last several years, she has taken her nieces and nephews on trips to Thailand, Greece, Egypt, Russia and Tahiti. Her niece Isabelle is her assistant; another niece, Chase, has modeled for the brand; while a third, Jeannie, worked on Ms. Sui's e-commerce and web content. \"We kind of all work together,\" Ms. Sui explained.</p><p>Here, Ms. Sui talks about her obsession with vintage David Webb animal bracelets, her daily shopping routines and why \"cool\" is such a loaded word these days.</p><p>I learn about new stuff from: my nieces. I'll ask them what they're listening to and just start exploring. We recently went to \"Dimes Square\" [a Manhattan shopping district at the triangle where Canal and Division Streets meet] which was a new part of New York for me. It reminded me of the beginnings of Soho. I bought some linen napkins edged in neon and ribbon from the housewares store Coming Soon. It was really fun to explore and then go eat at Russ and Daughters.</p><p>I collect: jewelry. I love Bakelite. I miss going to Portobello Road Market in London. There were always all these vendors selling jet jewelry. My newest obsession is David Webb animal bracelets from the '60s. I remember them in the [Diana] Vreeland issues of Vogue. They were always stacked, which you can't actually do because it chips the enamel. Every once in a while, I'll treat myself to one. I recently got the black frog bracelet. I'd seen it at auction five years ago, then I never saw it again. I finally found another one online, [from a vendor] in Palm Beach.</p><p>I start my day by: shopping on my phone. I'll see what's at Mytheresa, what's at MatchesFashion. I go through the gamut. I try not to buy anything [immediately] because it's so impulsive. I have to obsess about something for a day or two. If I've forgotten about it by the next day, I didn't really want it.</p><p>The last thing I bought online was: a sweater [model] Liya Kebede wore at the recent men's fashion shows. It took me a long time to figure out what it was, but I finally Google-Image-searched it and learned it was Raf Simons. I got it on Farfetch. It's mohair, green and black, with some cable-knit, and it's a little distressed. Very Vivienne Westwood: kind of punk, kind of deconstructed, two sweaters sewn together. It's going to be hard to look as good as Liya Kebede wearing it.</p><p>One of my favorite lunches is: a Young Chicken sandwich and a sundae at Serendipity3 on the Upper East Side. It's such a treat. I love the ambience there. My kitchen is inspired by it, and I have furniture that looks just like theirs.</p><p>On my hair, I use: R+Co Television shampoo and conditioner. It's really good for your hairâ€”fresh but not floral. I have almost everyone in my family using it, so it made an easy early Christmas present.</p><p>My go-to shoes of the moment are: my R13 combat boots [which I've been wearing] for more than a year, from daytime to evening. They're kind of the look right now.</p><p>My favorite visual artist is: Aubrey Beardsley. He was a psychedelic-poster artist but from the art nouveau period. I think his work shaped so much of my vision aesthetically, the whole black-and-white thing. It rings a bell for me. Whenever I see it, it makes me so happy.</p><p>I've been watching: \"The Beatles: Get Back\" on Disney+ over and over. It's eight hours, but it's like spending that month with the Beatles. That was the first band I bought fanzines for. I just keep looking at the outfits, wondering things like: Where did George get those boots?</p><p>Also, my friend [the photographer] Steven Meisel told me to watch \"All Passion Spent,\" a three-episode BBC series from 1986 based on a book by Vita Sackville-West starring Wendy Hiller. I found it on YouTube. It was amazing, especially the sets. Lately, I've been watching a lot on YouTube, and you get down this whole rabbit hole, and then it's five a.m.</p><p>My favorite fruit is: the pear. I think it's an underrated fruit. I particularly like Bartlett pears.</p><p>One of my heroes is: [the late artist and model] Anita Pallenberg, who was a good friend. She was just an incredible person.</p><p>If I could have a dinner party with historical figures: I'd love to have one with her and [the late member of the Rolling Stones] Brian Jones. I'd probably order in dim sum.</p><p>I often order delivery from: [New York Chinese restaurant] RedFarm. Their soup dumplings have a really good flavor.</p><p>I love to travel to: Japan. I used to go two or three times a year, and I always stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo. The staff is amazing. The beds are comfortable. The pillows are great. There's a huge bathtub and closet space. You can spread out. It was my home away from home, but in contrast to my own apartment which is so cluttered, these rooms are sparse.</p><p>I'm reading: \"Capote's Women\" by Laurence Leamer, which made me want to reread \"Answered Prayers\" by Truman Capote. I read it when it first came out [in 1987]. It's so bitchy and mean and dishy. The access he must have had! How could somebody not have taken a hit out on him?</p><p>One cultural shift I've noticed is that: I don't know if \"cool\" is a concept anymore. People say \"cool\" all the time, but I don't think \"cool\" is the same as \"cool\" was. The Velvet Underground was \"cool.\" I don't know if I'd call Harry Styles \"cool.\" Our concept of \"cool\" was special, but now the bigger audience and the more likes seems to win.</p><p>MORE IN STYLE &amp; FASHION</p><p>* Men's Earrings: Why Even Lawyers and Accountants Are Embracing Studs and Hoops December 21, 2021</p><p>* Sorry, Betty Draper: How Hostess Style Went From Stifling to Cool December 16, 2021</p><p>* How 'Succession' Stoked a Frenzy for Status Baseball Caps December 15, 2021</p><p>* Today's 'It' Bags Are Under $350.
