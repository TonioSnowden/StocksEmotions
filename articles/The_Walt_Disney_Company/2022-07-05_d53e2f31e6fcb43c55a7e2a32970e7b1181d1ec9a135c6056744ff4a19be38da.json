  "title": "Media, Tech Executives Descend on Sun Valley Conference as Recession Fears Loom; The conference, which has taken place since 1983, has been the birthplace of many megadeals",
  "text": "<p>The conference, which has taken place since 1983, has been the site where past megadeals were born, such as Comcast Corp.'s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos's 2013 deal for the Washington Post and Walt Disney Co.'s 1995 agreement to buy Capital Cities/ABC.</p><p>As usual, the guest list for this year's conference is stacked with top entertainment-industry executives including David Zaslav, the head of the newly formed Warner Brothers Discovery Inc.; Comcast Corp.'s Brian Roberts; Paramount Global's Shari Redstone; Netflix Inc.'s Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos; and Walt Disney Co. leader Bob Chapek.</p><p>Tech leaders such as Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who is stepping down in coming months, also are on the attendee list. Twitter Inc. CEO Parag Agrawal is expected to be there, as well as Elon Musk, who hasn't attended in recent years but is in the process of acquiring the social-media platform.</p><p>Industry observers say that while potential deals are often on the minds of the leaders at Sun Valley, economic headwinds are expected to be a main topic of discussion, and could affect the likelihood of future mergers.</p><p>\"Even if the economy doesn't go into a recession, stagnation is lingering and there are supply chain issues that could affect advertising. Major advertising sectors, like the auto industry, may pull back on marketing,\" said Neil Begley, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. \"Business leaders don't have much control over that, but can talk about it and how cautious they should be around costs.\"</p><p>Netflix has been looking to control costs, laying off more than 400 employees in two rounds of cuts in recent months. The streaming giant earlier this year reported its first quarterly loss of subscribers in more than a decade, and said it expected to lose 2 million global subscribers in the second quarter.</p><p>\"With a coming recession, media CEOs will be focused on the impact to streaming subscriptions and advertising to gauge the broader economic impact it will have across consumer spending on media,\" said Jason Anderson, CEO of Quire, a boutique investment bank. He added that due to fears of a recession, merger discussions are likely slowing or being \"aggressively repriced.\"</p><p>Mr. Zaslav, who recently took over the newly combined Warner Brothers Discovery, earlier this year said his company wasn't \"trying to win the direct-to-consumer spending war.\" Warner Brothers Discovery has said it plans to combine its two most prominent streaming services, HBO Max and Discovery+, into one offering that will include both an ad-supported platform and a commercial-free offering.</p><p>Other streaming services have moved aggressively to acquire new content in recent months, particularly live sports.</p><p>Apple Inc. last month signed a 10-year deal worth at least $2.5 billion for global rights to Major League Soccer, and earlier this year bought the right to air two Major League Baseball games on Friday nights. Amazon last year reached a deal to become the exclusive home to the National Football League's Thursday Night Football this coming season.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple, along with Disney's ESPN, have been circling the NFL's subscription package Sunday Ticket, The Wall Street Journal recently reported.</p><p>\"Sports remain critical to media CEOs,\" said Mr. Anderson.</p><p>Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com</p><p>Media, Tech Executives Descend on Sun Valley Conference as Recession Fears Loom</p>",
