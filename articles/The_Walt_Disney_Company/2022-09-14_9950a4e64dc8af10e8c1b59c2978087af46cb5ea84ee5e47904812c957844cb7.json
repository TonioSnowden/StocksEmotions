  "text": "<p>Viewers must toggle between different apps on their smartphones, televisions and other devices to watch content on each service. Placing all three services under one umbrella in a single app would reduce that friction, Mr. Chapek said. The company has already experimented with such a model in Europe, where the Star streaming brand, which includes many shows that also air on Hulu, is already part of Disney+.</p><p>Mr. Chapek referred to this sort of packaging, in a single app, as a \"hard bundle,\" as opposed to the softer bundles it already offers in the U.S., where consumers get a price discount for signing up for several services but they remain on separate apps.</p><p>(More to Come)</p><p>Disney's Bob Chapek Points to All-in-One Streaming App</p>",
