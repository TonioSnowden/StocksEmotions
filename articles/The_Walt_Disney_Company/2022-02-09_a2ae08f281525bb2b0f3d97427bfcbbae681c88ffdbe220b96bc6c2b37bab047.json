  "text": "<p>Walt&#xa0;Disney eased concerns that the streaming video boom was running out of steam as it reported a strong rise in new subscribers to Disney Plus in its latest quarter and forecast that releases such as <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> would bring in more viewers later this year. </p> <p>Disney also reported a strong rebound from coronavirus pandemic lows at its theme parks and resorts, where quarterly revenue totalled $7.2bn — higher than pre-pandemic levels and up from $3.5bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49581411-5650-4448-8325-ce12f85ee86b\">a year earlier</a>.</p> <p>The company's shares rose 8 per cent in after-hours trading after Bob Chapek, chief executive, said it was on track to meet targets of 230mn-260mn subscribers to its Disney Plus streaming service by 2024. </p> <p>Disney earned $1.06 a share in the first quarter, far higher than Wall Street's estimates of 63 cents, and up from 32 cents a year ago.</p> <p>Investors have grown concerned that the streaming market has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70f478ab-e48a-464e-ace9-33b86b51e2de\">started to plateau</a>, especially in the US, after rapid growth during the pandemic. Netflix <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fea461d6-e3e0-4016-a641-fca87e59d019\">disappointed</a> investors after warning last month that subscriber growth would slow substantially in early 2022. </p> <p>But Disney Plus reported strong subscriber growth, adding 11.8mn sign-ups in the quarter, as viewers paid to watch <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9fa2003-de09-4d2b-b6b0-7e30a2fff625\"><em>The Beatles: Get Back</em></a> and the animated film <em>Encanto.</em> </p> <p>Total subscribers stood at 129.8mn at the end of Disney's first fiscal quarter, which runs to January 1, well above analyst expectations of 125mn. </p> <p>“We've had a very strong start to the fiscal year, with a significant rise in earnings per share, record revenue and operating income at our domestic parks and resorts . . . and a significant increase in total subscriptions across our streaming portfolio,” Chapek said. </p> <p>He has placed Disney Plus at the centre of the company's strategy and is spending billions on content to attract subscribers globally. For all of its direct-to-consumer streaming services — which include Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu — operating losses rose 27 per cent to $600mn. </p> <p>The bulk of the losses was at Disney Plus, though average monthly revenue per subscriber rose to $6.68 from $5.80 in the quarter. </p> <p>As with its competitors, Disney is still working to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae756fda-4c27-4732-89af-cb6903f2ab40\">revive its pipeline</a> of films and TV programmes after the production disruptions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. </p> <p>Chapek said a number of releases this year should boost subscriptions, including Pixar's <em>Turning Red</em>, two Marvel series and two Star Wars series. It is also releasing a live-action reimagining of <em>Pinocchio</em> starring Tom Hanks. </p> <p>He said Disney continued “to see value in the moviegoing experience” in cinemas — especially with big franchise blockbusters — but added that the company would continue to debut films on its streaming services.<br></p><p>Source: Christopher Grimes in Los Angeles  2022 'Disney eases streaming fears with strong subscriber growth' FT.com 9 February.
