  "title": "The Funeral Industry  Plots a Rebrand: We're Fun  ---  Mortuaries look to generate 'warm leads'  with golf, live music, bouncy castles  ----  By Dominique Mosbergen",
  "text": "<p>   Morticians are finding ways to put the fun in funeral to get customers to think about their final farewells -- and open their wallets -- long before the end. </p><p>   At an industry convention in Baltimore last month, funeral directors were invited to a workshop on how to \"build your preneed customer pipeline\" and \"generate warm leads.\" Among the pro tips some have implemented: Dinners at cemeteries, so-called death cafes and burial-plot lotteries. </p><p>   \"I am selling a product nobody wants, but ultimately everybody has to have it,\" said Brandon Patterson, one convention attendee. </p><p>   Mr. Patterson said 500 people showed up for a party at his Shreveport Funeral Home &amp; Cremation Tribute Center in Louisiana in October. There was food, live music and a bouncy castle for kids. His staff raffled prizes including tumblers bearing the funeral home logo and tickets to a gospel-music concert. Grammy-nominated singer Major attended. Mr. Patterson said he sees such events as icebreakers into discussions on planning for one's passage into the hereafter. \"You have to find a way to make the conversation as pleasant as possible,\" he said. </p><p>   A quarter or more of business at many funeral homes comes from services  arranged while the customer was alive, according to Foresight Companies, a Phoenix-based consulting firm. Industry leaders see opportunities for growth. Most people in the U.S. haven't planned their funerals, according to a March survey by the National Funeral Directors Association. About 15% of people 40 and older said they had made arrangements in writing, but only a third of that group had started paying for them. </p><p>   There are myriad ways for people to express themselves and show off their passions after death. At the Baltimore convention, companies displayed see-through caskets and ones made of wicker. There were biodegradable urns shaped like turtles, old-fashioned hearses and companies that turn your ashes into pebbles or use them to grow bonsai plants. </p><p>   The average cost of a funeral with viewing and burial is about $8,000 -- double the price from the early 1990s, according to the NFDA. That doesn't include the cost of a monument or burial vault and plot. Customers, those in the industry say, can buy peace of mind in making their own pre-arrangements. </p><p>   \"It takes the burden away from the people who survive you,\" said Neil Fogarty, president of Dodds Memorials, a Xenia, Ohio-based company that makes cemetery monuments. </p><p>   \"People start planning and they realize, 'Holy cow, there are so many decisions to be made,'\" said Mr. Fogarty, who organized a three-day \"Before I Die\" festival in the Dayton, Ohio, area last weekend. The festival included a Day of the Dead-themed dinner at a cemetery, screenings of death-themed movies including \"Coco\" from Walt Disney Co.'s Pixar and a death cafe, where people could converse about mortality. </p><p>   \"We're convincing people that just as talking about sex doesn't make you pregnant, talking about death doesn't make you dead,\" said Gail Rubin, who spoke at the festival. She has hosted Before I Die festivals since 2017, and sells a do-it-yourself kit that includes a manual on how to organize a festival, a planning checklist and instructions on how to play the Newly-Dead Game, which involves couples answering questions about their partner's final wishes. </p><p>   At Greenlawn Funeral Homes, Cremations &amp; Cemeteries, in Bakersfield, Calif., dozens came to a recent \"Chip and Learn\" event where they aimed golf balls at a 5-gallon bucket for a chance to win 30% off a prepaid funeral package or burial plot. Greenlawn said it sold 20 \"preneed\" packages at a Before I Die event in 2019, during which attendees peered into an empty grave, poked the insides of caskets and explored workings of a crematory. Greenlawn has also hosted events at restaurants and wine bars for people to talk about their funerals. \"At first some people were like, 'This is disrespectful,' but we've had a lot of engagement, a lot of positive reviews,\" said Jim La Mar, Greenlawn's president. </p><p>   Mountain View Funeral Home &amp; Cemetery in Mesa, Ariz., is creating repeat customers by holding living funerals. At one gathering last year, held to coincide with the dearly not-yet-departed's birthday, cans of soda and Bud Light filled an open casket and a funeral procession was organized, complete with a hearse. Wyndie Scott, a commercial props designer, said she organized the event for her husband because she wanted him to know how much he means to the people in his life. \"I told him, 'I don't know if I can hold a real funeral now. I don't know if anything could be better than this.'\" At the end of the event, Ms. Scott, who organized door-gifts for attendees, awarded two raffle winners a buy-one-get-one-free cremation deal. \"One lady loved it and one friend thought it was the oddest, most uncomfortable thing,\" she said. </p><p></p>",
