  "title": "Thomas S. Murphy Built TV Empire With Help From a Pal, Warren Buffett; Entrepreneur, who has died at age 96, led Capital Cities, acquired ABC and later sold the business to Disney",
  "text": "<p>That business became Capital Cities Communications Inc. Led by Mr. Murphy, it bought TV stations around the country, diversified into newspapers and cable TV, and in 1985 agreed to acquire the much bigger American Broadcasting Cos. for $3.5 billion.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc.—headed by Mr. Buffett—helped finance that deal by investing $517.5 million and acquiring an 18% stake in Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</p><p>A decade later, in 1995, Mr. Murphy agreed to sell Capital Cities/ABC to Walt Disney Co. for about $19 billion, then the second-largest acquisition in U.S. history.</p><p>Mr. Murphy died May 25 at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 96.</p><p>Those who bought stock in Capital Cities in 1957, Mr. Murphy calculated, would have reaped $2,000 in 1995 for every $1 originally invested.</p><p>He attributed his success to a knack for salesmanship and good judgment. \"One of the most uncommon things in life,\" he said in a 2000 interview at Harvard Business School, \"is common sense.\"</p><p>Mr. Murphy controlled costs but was reluctant to meddle with the creative aspects of TV entertainment. Robert Iger, who was a senior executive at Capital Cities/ABC and later headed Disney, recalled Mr. Murphy's response to the 1989 screening of a pilot for the \"Twin Peaks\" television series, featuring bizarre characters and creepy events in a small town. When the viewing was over, Mr. Iger recalled, Mr. Murphy turned slowly toward him and said, \"Bob, I don't think I really know what that was but I'm pretty sure it was really good.\"</p><p>As a devout Roman Catholic, Mr. Murphy had qualms about some of the sexually charged material shown on the ABC network. He recalled once confiding to a monsignor that he couldn't run the network as the church might wish and had to treat it as a business. The monsignor told him not to worry and added: \"You'll do this better than anybody else will.\"</p><p>Thomas Sawyer Murphy, known as Tom, was born May 31, 1925, in Brooklyn. His father, Charles E. Murphy, was a lawyer and later a state judge. One of Judge Murphy's maxims, recalled later by Tom Murphy, was: \"Never do anything that would cost you a good night's sleep.\"</p><p>After completing high school, Mr. Murphy enrolled at Princeton University and signed up for a Navy officer-training program. The Navy sent him to Cornell University, where he completed an accelerated major in mechanical engineering. By the time his training was complete and he was assigned to a ship in 1945, World War II was ending.</p><p>Discharged from the Navy in 1946, he applied to Harvard Business School but was advised to get some business experience first. He spent a year selling industrial oil, then applied again and was accepted at Harvard, where he was one of the top M.B.A. graduates in 1949. Military service and Harvard, he said later, were crucial in building his self-confidence.</p><p>He worked for Lever Brothers, a soap company, and in advertising before joining Hudson Valley Broadcasting, which evolved into Capital Cities. The business struggled at first and nearly failed but gradually moved into the black and later maintained exceptionally high profit margins, Mr. Murphy said. He was so determined to hold down costs that he once had the company headquarters building painted only on the sides visible from the road.</p><p>Mr. Murphy became chairman of Capital Cities after the death of his boss, Frank Milton Smith, in 1966. A mutual friend introduced him to Mr. Buffett. They had a steak dinner in Omaha, Neb., and played racquetball. Mr. Buffett became a mentor.</p><p>For decades, Mr. Murphy ran the company in tandem with Daniel B. Burke, a Korean War veteran who was responsible for operational details. Mr. Buffett once quipped that having the two of them at Capital Cities was \"like having Ruth and Gehrig in the same lineup.\"</p><p>The ABC acquisition challenged them. When Messrs. Murphy and Burke visited ABC headquarters in late 1985, they noticed signs of financial strain: bare spots on the walls where paintings by Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning had hung.</p><p>They fired about 1,500 people and shut down the executive dining room. When Mr. Murphy made his first visit to ABC's entertainment division in Los Angeles, a driver in a white stretch limousine met him at the airport. On the next trip, he ordered a taxi.</p><p>On the plus side, ABC came with control of the cable sports network ESPN, whose full value wasn't yet recognized.</p><p>Mr. Murphy married Suzanne Crosby, a medical secretary, in 1955. She died in 2009. He is survived by their four children and nine grandchildren.</p><p>He served at various times on the boards of Disney, Berkshire Hathaway and International Business Machines Corp. He was chairman of the board of trustees at Save the Children from 1998 to 2005.</p><p>Mr. Murphy was distressed by trends in television news. In his day, he said in a 2018 podcast with David Novak, \"we were interested in the facts and only the facts, and it is sad what has happened to the news business in the U.S., where everyone is questioning whether it's facts or not.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
