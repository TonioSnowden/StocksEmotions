  "text": "<p>   A veteran TV journalist said Friday that CNN anchor Chris Cuomo groped her in 2005 while they were both employees of Walt Disney Co.'s ABC News. </p><p>   Shelley Ross said in an essay for the New York Times that she was attending a going-away party for a co-worker at a bar in Manhattan's Upper West Side neighborhood when Mr. Cuomo walked toward her, enveloped her in a strong bear hug \"while lowering one hand to firmly grab and squeeze the cheek of my buttock.\" </p><p>   She said that the incident occurred in front of her husband and that Mr. Cuomo promptly sent an email to apologize, saying he was \"ashamed.\" </p><p>   Mr. Cuomo said in a statement that the incident happened 16 years ago in a public setting when Ms. Ross was a top executive at ABC. He added that it wasn't sexual in nature.\"I apologized to her then, and I meant it,\" Mr. Cuomo said. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment. </p><p>   Mr. Cuomo has been in the headlines for his off-camera behavior. Earlier this year, Mr. Cuomo gave a lengthy on-air apology for participating in strategy sessions with advisers for his brother, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, as the governor responded to multiple allegations of sexual assault. </p><p>   CNN didn't discipline Mr. Cuomo, one of its biggest stars and the anchor of its \"Cuomo Prime Time\" 9 p.m. ET hour. </p><p>   Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, had said in a staff meeting that Mr. Cuomo's participation in the strategy sessions was inappropriate but had added that the network wouldn't discipline him, saying a suspension would amount to \"punishment for the sake of punishing.\" </p><p></p>",
