  "text": "<p>\"This is a soft theatrical opening. Disney is the best family brand in the business,\" said box-office analyst David A. Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research Inc.</p><p>\"Raya and the Last Dragon\" is also available on Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming platform, Disney+, for an additional $29.99 on top of the monthly subscription rate of $6.99. The company hasn't released viewer data.</p><p>Cinemark Holdings Inc. didn't respond to requests about why it chose not to play \"Raya and the Last Dragon,\" the weekend's biggest release from the film industry's biggest studio.</p><p>But the move comes amid growing tension between Hollywood studios and movie theater chains over whether the theaters should get to show movies before they premiere on streaming services and for how long.</p><p>With pandemic policies shutting theaters and viewers turning to at-home entertainment, Hollywood studios responded by debuting new films via their streaming services, cutting out or cutting short the prepandemic window of exclusive theatrical release.</p><p>With more multiplexes now open, such as in New York City and San Francisco at 25% capacity this weekend, more theater chains, such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Cinemark are hoping for a recovery. However, it is still unclear how soon consumers are ready to embrace the in-person, big screen experience.</p><p>None of Cinemark's 345 theaters across 42 states showed \"Raya and the Last Dragon,\" according to a person familiar with U.S. box office data. Some smaller movie theater operators like Harkins Theatres, which has more than 30 domestic locations, also didn't offer the movie, the person also said.</p><p>Harkins Theatres, which says it is the fifth-largest chain in North America, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>While top theater chain AMC showed \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" this weekend, North America's second-largest chain, Cineworld Group PLC's Regal Entertainment Group remains shut, as the company waits for assurances that Hollywood will stick to plans to release high-profile films.</p><p>---</p><p>Estimated Box-Office Figures, Through Sunday </p><p>Sales, In Millions </p><p>Film                            Distributor            Weekend*   Cumulative  % Change </p><p>1.
