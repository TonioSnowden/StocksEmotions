  "text": "<p>Founded in 2012, Canva grew rapidly by allowing schools and nonprofit organizations to use its entire product suite free. Now, more than 100 million people worldwide use its online platform each month to create anything from corporate presentations to children's party invitations. About 10% of users pay for additional functions, including the ability to work in teams.</p><p>Canva executives say annual revenue exceeds $1 billion and the company has been profitable since 2017. A 2021 funding round valued Canva at about $40 billion, and its investors include Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger and Australia's Blackbird Ventures, which counts Tesla Inc. Chair Robyn Denholm as a partner.</p><p>Canva executives say their strategy pairs well with a gloomier economic outlook.</p><p>Canva didn't raise prices when incorporating its existing design platform into a new worksuite of products including tools for website design, presentations and printing. As a starting point, businesses pay $150 annually for up to five users to use the premium version. According to Canva executives, the idea is to provide a cheaper and more intuitive alternative to products including those offered by Adobe and Microsoft.</p><p>\"Regardless of the choppy seas, we're in a very fortunate position because we're profitable, because we're a company that companies are turning to in an economic downturn,\" said Melanie Perkins, who founded Canva with Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams.</p><p>Mr. Adams said Canva has around $700 million in cash from funding rounds that is largely untouched.</p><p>Still, Canva is pitching new products when many tech firms are finding it hard to persuade customers to pay for existing services.</p><p>This month, shares of U.S.-listed software firms Cloudflare Inc. and Atlassian Corp. -- both of which give customers a limited free version of their product to entice them to upgrade -- had their worst week yet as investors worried about subscription numbers. Cloudflare said customers have downgraded to its free product over its past two fiscal quarters, while Atlassian said customers were converting to paid subscriptions at a slower pace.</p><p>Canva remains a relatively small player, its revenue dwarfed by the $15.8 billion generated by Adobe. In December 2021, Adobe relaunched its own freemium visual-design tool, targeting what it sees as the same light-needs audience as Canva at a similar price. Executives say the Adobe Express platform has attracted 20 million new sign-ups since then. In September, it agreed to buy collaborative design startup Figma for $20 billion.</p><p>Ms. Perkins conceived the idea that would become Canva after trying to teach fellow university students in Australia's far west how to use multiple design platforms. In 2007, Ms. Perkins and Mr. Obrecht created a school yearbook design tool that within five years became Australia's largest yearbook company. They then created Canva as a design platform open to anyone capable of using a web browser or smartphone.</p><p>Canva's core concept is that communication shaped by remote working, global collaboration and online interaction is best done visually. People have posted images and videos on social media for years, and those storytelling skills are now common in the workplace, Mr. Adams said.</p><p>Still, the pullback by tech stocks has hurt Canva's valuation. Blackbird Ventures, which owns 15% of Canva, recently reduced its valuation of the company's total equity to $26 billion. Blackbird's Ms. Denholm said privately held companies should tread carefully given the uncertainty. \"The message at this point in time is to look at your business model and make sure that you're making the funding last as long as you can, particularly for later-stage companies,\" Ms. Denholm said.</p><p>Canva said its growth strategy is showing early signs of success, with several large U.S. companies signing up.</p>",
