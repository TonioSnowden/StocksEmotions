  "text": "<p>My favorite books this year were David Herbert Donald's 1995 \"Lincoln\"\" and Thomas E. Ricks's recent \"Waging a Good War.\" Donald's Lincoln begins as an old-school Whig, but by the mid-1850s his party is moribund. On May 29, 1856, the new Illinois Republican Party meets in convention, and Lincoln delivers a party-defining speech. His message, that \"the Union must be preserved in the purity of its principles as well as in the integrity of its territorial parts,\" isn't a geographical claim but a moral one -- about the requirements of self-government among free and equal citizens. The need to end slavery follows from it. \"Waging a Good War\" is a stirring after-action report on the 1960s civil rights movement. Like \"Lincoln\" it honors (among a dozen others) a citizen-hero who sought to reanimate democracy's moral core -- Bob Moses, architect of Mississippi's Freedom Summer. Is it worth tracing Lincoln's efforts to fashion a party fit for purpose in his times? Is it worth scrutinizing how a military-style discipline was fundamental to civil rights' success? Yes -- these are means by which power is forged and the world changed. How can any American seeking a healthy democracy not wish to understand that better?</p><p>-- Ms. Allen is a professor of political philosophy, ethics and public policy at Harvard University.</p><p>William Barr</p><p>In \"How the World Really Works\" the distinguished Canadian environmental scientist Vaclav Smil distills a lifetime of erudition. The modern world's urban population, says Mr. Smil, has become disconnected from the material and energy requirements needed to sustain human life. His book explains the central role played by fossil fuels in achieving today's quality and security of life. Mr. Smil describes the massive extent to which fossil fuels are required to extract and produce the core materials -- ammonia-based fertilizers, steel, cement and plastics -- that are indispensable to feeding the world and building the machines and infrastructure on which modern economies depend. Mr. Smil agrees we should be moving away from reliance on fossil fuels, but he also argues we must move away from \"extreme views,\" especially the notion that we can decarbonize in just two or three decades. According to him this is a fantasy that ignores basic physical and material realities. Within the realm of the possible, he writes, \"one thing remains certain\" about transitioning to renewable energy: \"It will not be (it cannot be) a sudden abandonment of fossil carbon, nor even its rapid demise -- but rather its gradual decline.\" Today's progressivism and its policy prescriptions -- from transgenderism to its extreme Green agenda -- have become increasingly disconnected from objective physical reality. This is odd for a creed rooted in historical materialism.</p><p>-- Mr. Barr, who served as U.S. attorney general in 1991-93 and 2019-20, is the author of \"One Damn Thing After Another.\"</p><p>Andrea Barrett</p><p>I was haunted during this year of my mother's death by Kathryn Davis's slim and mysterious \"Aurelia, Aurelia,\" a memoir in name only. Superficially it resembles some recent books that blend autobiographical elements with literary reflections to reveal the self through a scrim of earlier writings. But it's more allusive (and elusive) than that. While ostensibly reflecting on illness, loss and widowhood, Ms. Davis, now in her 70s, explores the relationships between art, love, grief and the limits of expository language. Linear memory is useless here: \"When someone you have lived with for a very long time dies, memory stops working its regular way -- it goes crazy. It is no longer like remembering; it is, more often, like astral projection.\" Cherished texts -- especially the \"Time Passes\" section of Virginia Woolf's \"To the Lighthouse,\" a sequence \"that announces itself to be, by virtue of its title and everything in it, pure transition\" -- shroud crucial facts of Ms. Davis's life, which we glimpse almost in passing. \"Everything of vital importance having to do with human beings,\" she writes of Woolf's work, \"is happening here, swiftly, in brackets.\" That's a perfect way to describe the form of \"Aurelia, Aurelia,\" which is about transition, whether between the parts of a novel or a Beethoven bagatelle, or of a human being in that final journey from this world to the next.</p><p>-- Ms. Barrett is the author, most recently, of the story collection \"Natural History.\"</p><p>Kate Beaton</p><p>I just finished Lachlan MacKinnon's \"Closing Sysco: Industrial Decline in Atlantic Canada's Steel City,\" and even though it's a regional text, it speaks to larger questions. People's lives are tied to the places affected by deindustrialization. For a more just, equitable labor future, the body of evidence comes not from the top down but from the bottom up, from the bodies themselves. Somewhat related, I finally read Elizabeth Catte's \"What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia.\" Though it was written as a rebuttal to J.D. Vance's \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" I was more interested in it as an illuminating book in its own right about a region that is heavily mischaracterized and, like Atlantic Canada, no stranger to either deindustrialization or stereotype. I was not disappointed by this thoughtful, assertive text. Appalachia comes alive under Ms. Catte's pen as the diverse, complex place it is. A little book with a punch.</p><p>-- Ms. Beaton is the author and illustrator of \"Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands.\"</p><p>Toni Bentley</p><p>In a time of great need -- I know no other -- I read only classics. While profound art cannot relieve my frequent revulsion to our unkind species, it can divert my gaze. I wish to sit at the feet of the magnificently superior, preferably on a red-velvet cushion, in total surrender to it -- however dead or male. (I likely absorbed this proclivity from growing up in the world of a living genius, George Balanchine, where I experienced the advantages of unconditional receptivity.) I recently devoured, and adored, virtually all of Edith Wharton -- her frequent commentary on marriage, for women in particular, is modern, witty and condemnatory. \"Summer\" and \"The Reef\" stand out for their sly, bold yet subtle consideration of the ever-pervasive, ever-avoided, undercurrents of incest. After Wharton, I returned to Henry James to avoid disappointment. I can think of no greater pleasure than getting lost, entirely lost, in the four-page paragraphs and half-page sentences detailing such layered minutiae of sensitivity and perception as make up \"The Golden Bowl.\" I feel more intimacy with the beautiful windings of James's mind than I ever could with a mere human. It is like an adulterous love affair where I am willingly abducted into a tender complicity that includes frequent violation from my side with my Uni-ball 207: underlinings, boxes around words new to me, exclamation points and \"Ha!\"s of delight, the occasional Post-it note for easy revisitation of the transcendently wise. These are the scribblings of consummation, a guarantee that no one will steal my copy -- and a great gush of gratitude floods me. It is thrilling.</p><p>-- Ms. Bentley is the author, most recently, of \"Serenade: A Balanchine Story.\"</p><p>Steve Case</p><p>Earlier this year, the Oracle Happiness Report showed that nearly half the global population claimed to have not felt true happiness since the start of the pandemic. A quarter said they had forgotten what it meant to be truly happy. These sobering statistics make \"From Strength to Strength\" by Arthur Brooks a most timely read. Mr. Brooks takes on the worthy job of advising us how to find greater inner purpose and happiness. The pandemic forced most of us to confront challenging questions about what we value and what makes us truly happy; this book helps us think through those decisions with the recognition that building a happy life, especially as we age, takes work. Mr. Brooks creates a detailed roadmap to happiness, not just from his own wisdom but from social science, eastern philosophy and interviews with others who have struggled with major life decisions. Rather than dwell on disappointment, this book reshapes our thinking to recognize that the best is yet to come.</p><p>-- Mr. Case, a co-founder of AOL, is the author of \"The Rise of the Rest.\"</p><p>Katherine J. Chen</p><p>This year was fraught with what I can only describe as an almost paralyzing anxiety. I found it hard to sit down, to discover solace even in reading. The most I could manage, for a long while, was thousand-piece jigsaw puzzles, which I would work at feverishly for seven, eight hours at a time. There is, however, a recurring pattern in my life: I always seem to pick up the precise book I need at the moment, usually while undergoing some kind of internal crisis. That book for me was Hilary Mantel's memoir, \"Giving Up the Ghost.\" I read it, I marveled, I castigated myself for my self-pity. And almost immediately after closing it, I imparted Mantel's story to the one-member audience of my mother, where- upon we cried together. About two months later, I learned of the author's passing. Ever since, I've felt that I have been reading in Mantel's memory, asking, as one does to those who remain unreachable, questions that will never receive an answer. To use Mantel's own words, I have been \"reading a book as if [my] eyes were hoovering the words from the page.\" Her memoir broke the spell of my reading inertia, shook me awake, and said to me, in the voice of the resounding first line of \"Wolf Hall,\" \"So now get up.\"</p><p>-- Ms. Chen is the author of \"Joan: A Novel of Joan of Arc.\"</p><p>Deborah Cohen</p><p>What was past doesn't stay buried, but there's no telling exactly what form the ghouls take when they climb out of their graves. Among my favorite books this year are two accounts that filter histories of political repression through the shades of family. In her captivating and darkly comical \"Free,\" a story of a Communist girlhood and its aftermath, Lea Ypi charts the disorientation that followed when history turned on its axis. Linda Kinstler's \"Come to This Court and Cry,\" a tale of Holocaust reckoning that stretches from Latvia to Israel to Uruguay, is searching as well as surprising. Two books about the refugee crisis have stayed with me, each immersive and full of unforgettable detail: Matthieu Aikins's \"The Naked Don't Fear the Water\" and Sally Hayden's \"My Fourth Time, We Drowned.\" Morally serious and well told, they make for essential reading. If the world's weighing too heavily, how about escaping with five volumes on the travails of an English business family on the brink of World War II? The first of Elizabeth Jane Howard's gorgeously observed Cazalet Chronicles was published in 1990. As I wolfed down the Cazalet novels last summer, I wondered why I'd waited so long.</p><p>-- Ms. Cohen is a professor of history at Northwestern University and the author, most recently, of \"Last Call at the Hotel Imperial.\"</p><p>Patrick Collison</p><p>The best book I read this year was \"The World of Yesterday\" by Stefan Zweig. A vivid account of Austria and its pre-WWI cultural vibrancy, it left me sharing his sorrow for what was destroyed. Relatedly, Peter Watson's \"The German Genius\" examines what exactly happened in the 17th and 18th centuries that gave rise to Goethe, Bach, Kant, von Humboldt, et al. In Ireland, we don't tend to appreciate Edmund Burke very much, but I found Richard Bourke's \"Empire and Revolution\" to be a terrific account of Burke's thinking. His contributions to the debates around the American and French revolutions are well known, but he thought his opposition to the colonial abuses in India was more important. I and two others recently started Arc, a biomedical research organization, and I've been digging into the early days of other institutions. Harriet Zuckerman's books and Thomas Lee's \"Eugene Braunwald and the Rise of Modern Medicine\" stood out. So did \"Upstart\" by Ed Walsh, the founding president of the University of Limerick.</p><p>-- Mr. Collison is the CEO of Stripe.</p><p>Michael Connelly</p><p>My favorite book this year was Gabrielle Zevin's \"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,\" and it was only by happenstance that I read it. I was asked to be on a radio show that featured the novel as its monthly book-club selection. I knew I'd only have to read about 50 pages or so to render an opinion. The hosts were not interested in spoilers. So I got the book and the night I began I could not put it down and read until 4 a.m. -- it was that good. I was completely wrecked the next day for the interview. I read mostly nonfiction, usually stories about or by artists, hoping for some sort of shared inspiration. Two recent books that fit the bill for me were \"Cinema Speculation,\" by Quentin Tarantino, and \"The Philosophy of Modern Song,\" by Bob Dylan. I've enjoyed the work of both of these artists and reading about the films and songs that meant something to them was fun and illuminating. A crime novel I read that is just now making its way to bookstores is \"Everybody Knows\" by Jordan Harper. It's more than a crime novel. It's a fresh take and a hard look at our culture.</p><p>-- Mr. Connelly is the author, most recently, of \"Desert Star.\"</p><p>Matthew Continetti</p><p>The ranks of conservative journalism suffered many losses this year. WSJ theater critic Terry Teachout, scholar of philanthropy Martin Morse Wooster, speechwriter and columnist Michael Gerson, critic and essayist Midge Decter, and humorist P.J. O'Rourke died within the past 12 months, leaving the world a dimmer and duller place. Writers, of course, are never really gone: Their voices remain on the page. And much of my reading in 2022 was devoted to the work of these teachers and friends. I learned about the writer's craft from Teachout's \"The Skeptic: A Life of H.L. Mencken.\" I dipped into Wooster's \"The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of 'Donor Intent,'\" mulled over the policy agenda outlined in Gerson's \"Heroic Conservatism,\" and marveled at Decter's combination of style and sense in \"The Liberated Woman and Other Americans.\" O'Rourke's books fill a shelf in my office, and the spines of \"Parliament of Whores\" and \"Eat the Rich\" are cracked from frequent re-readings. Just added to the collection is \"The Funny Stuff: The Official P.J. O'Rourke Quotationary and Riffapedia,\" edited by Terry McDonell with a foreword by Christopher Buckley. All these books are worth revisiting and remembering. Along with the men and women who wrote them.</p><p>-- Mr. Continetti is the author of \"The Right: The Hundred-Year War for American Conservatism.\"</p><p>Alma Deutscher</p><p>I've read Frances Hardinge's \"The Lie Tree\" and \"Fly Trap\" so often that I almost know them by heart. Since imagination is such a vital part of my own life, I'm gripped by the author's combination of wildly imaginative fantasy with realistic characters, richly and wittily portrayed. Ms. Hardinge's latest book, \"Unraveller,\" is a page-turner of a mystery story. Her characterizations make even the wildest fantasy seem utterly believable. The heroine is a girl who was once transformed into a heron and later turned back into a human. This may sound rather like a prince turning into a frog: flat as a folk tale. But once Ms. Hardinge has led us through the girl's emotional pain on turning back into a \"ground-trudger\" (a human), once we have experienced her mental lapses into the predatory instincts of a heron (she watches with uncanny stillness the silver ripples of the water), once we have relived the nightmares from her bird-years and her remorse about attacking helpless cygnets while their mother tried in vain to protect them, then the fantasy has become totally real.</p><p>-- Ms. Deutscher's third opera, \"The Emperor's New Waltz,\" will premiere in Salzburg in March.</p><p>Hernan Diaz</p><p>Three novels are among my favorite books of 2022. At the beginning of this year, I bought a signed copy (red sharpie) of Claire-Louise Bennett's beautiful \"Checkout 19\" -- the opening section pulverized me. Another revelation was Caren Beilin's \"Revenge of the Scapegoat,\" which is obstinately surprising in every way. I was also moved by Maddie Mortimer's \"Maps of Our Spectacular Bodies,\" which charts how our bodies can be besieged, conquered and reclaimed throughout our lives. And two books published this year, but reaching us from the past, particularly touched me. I read \"The Uncollected Essays of Elizabeth Hardwick\" over the course of several months. Barbed and lyrical, these essays cover vast, uneven ground (Benjamin Britten and Monica Lewinsky; Faye Dunaway and Henry James), and the only thing they have in common is Hardwick's brilliant prose. I also loved Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"Private Notebooks: 1914-1916,\" translated by Marjorie Perloff. Written in the trenches during World War I -- in code, on the verso pages of an early draft of the \"Tractatus\" -- these are droningly intense journals whose layout can resemble that of a poem or, even more, the propositions in the \"Tractatus.\"</p><p>-- Mr. Diaz is the author, most recently, of \"Trust,\" a novel.</p><p>Kate DiCamillo</p><p>I've long been a fan of the Best American Short Stories series. For more than 30 years I've read each volume as it was released. During the pandemic, when I was in need of comfort and ballast, I randomly pulled an older BASS off the shelf (1989, edited by Margaret Atwood and Shannon Ravenel) and started to read. I was surprised by what I'd forgotten, and also by what I remembered. When I finished that volume, I moved on to another (1995, Jane Smiley and Katrina Kenison) and then another. And another. I'm still going! I've changed so much in the years since I first read these stories. Reading them now helps me to see myself, and other people, with greater clarity and compassion. Again and again, I have been amazed by the power of the form -- moved by how a story can console and counsel, illuminate and inspire.</p><p>-- Ms. DiCamillo is the author of more than 20 books for children, most recently the novel \"The Beatryce Prophecy.\"</p><p>Rebecca Donner</p><p>As war rages on in Ukraine, I've felt compelled to revisit Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich's outstanding oral history of Soviet women who fought in World War II. Published in Russia in 1985, \"The Unwomanly Face of War\" is a nimble distillation of thousands of hours of interviews that the author conducted with women pilots, antiaircraft gunners, foot soldiers and snipers on the Eastern Front (the accounts of women in noncombat roles -- nurses, surgeons, scouts, cooks and cryptographers -- are also vividly presented). The same impulse drove me to reread Antony Beevor's superb \"Stalingrad,\" which in turn led me to \"A Woman in Berlin,\" by German journalist Marta Hillers. First published anonymously in 1954, Hillers's wartime diary chronicles eight weeks in the spring of 1945, when Red Army soldiers captured Berlin. In his introduction to the 2005 British edition, Mr. Beevor describes the 34-year-old woman's testimony as \"one of the most important personal accounts ever written about the effects of war and defeat\" and \"one of the most revealing pieces of social history imaginable.\"</p><p>-- Ms. Donner is the author of \"All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days: The True Story of the American Woman at the Heart of the German Resistance to Hitler.\"</p><p>Annie Duke</p><p>\"All regrets aggravate. Productive regrets aggravate, then activate.\" That's one of my favorite lines from Daniel Pink's \"The Power of Regret: How Looking Backward Moves Us Forward.\" Regret is a powerful force, both in its emotional intensity and how it can affect our behavior and how we think about ourselves and our lives. Because we view regret negatively, we frequently ignore or minimize it, and rarely try to focus on how to understand it -- much less use it constructively. Mr. Pink argues that we can harness the power of regret to make a better life for ourselves. In addition to distilling the lessons from several decades of scientific research on the subject, he contributes a pair of his own massive research efforts, surveying more than 20,000 people, to develop a taxonomy of regrets, a deep structure that offers insights into the human condition and advice for using regret to learn from and improve on past decisions as well as to make better ones.</p><p>-- Ms. Duke is the author of \"Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away.\"</p><p>Geoff Dyer</p><p>In November and December of 2021 I read six novels by the English writer Elizabeth Taylor (1912-1975). The first two months of this year were spent reading the remaining six and any of the stories not included in the NYRB Classics selection \"You'll Enjoy It When You Get There\" (2014), edited by Margaret Drabble. This was the most intense and complete immersion in an author's work that I have enjoyed in God knows how long. It shaped the year's subsequent reading to the extent that my favorite new novel, Tessa Hadley's \"Free Love,\" seemed, in many ways, to be engaged in a creative conversation with her (famously) underappreciated predecessor. Taylor's bits of suburban and semirural England constitute a complete world; her knack for psychological and social observation -- both shrewd and skewed -- add up to an all-enveloping narrative consciousness. The best novel is probably her fifth, 1951's \"A Game of Hide and Seek\" (one of only four currently available in America), but curious readers should start at the beginning with \"At Mrs. Lippincote's\" (1945) and work their way through to the posthumously published \"Blaming\" (1976). After Christmas, in fact, I'm going to follow my own advice: start over and do exactly that.</p><p>-- Mr. Dyer's latest book is \"The Last Days of Roger Federer and Other Endings.\"</p><p>John Bel Edwards</p><p>At the beginning of this year, I had the great honor of signing a posthumous pardon for civil rights leader Homer Plessy, whose purchase of a train ticket in New Orleans led to the Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson decision upholding racial segregation and leading to generations of inequity in our country. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter in that case. When I signed the pardon for Plessy, Justice Harlan's family recommended \"The Great Dissenter: The Story of John Marshall Harlan, America's Judicial Hero\" by Peter S. Canellos. The book tells the story of a man who once himself owned slaves, had a complex family dynamic, and ultimately changed his own core values to become a defender of civil rights. It doesn't gloss over the harsh realities of our past, and shows what a lasting, profound impact we can all make by standing up for what's right.</p><p>-- Mr. Edwards is the governor of Louisiana.</p><p>Ada Ferrer</p><p>I read a lot about family this year. Tiya Miles's \"All That She Carried\" is a beautiful and moving work of history about a single artifact: a cotton sack given by an enslaved woman, Rose, to her 9-year old daughter, Ashley, who was being sold away; later, that little girl's granddaughter, Ruth, embroidered the sack with the story of that forced separation, even with the words spoken by mother to daughter in that unimaginable moment. The author, a master historian, uses the history of the sack to let readers glimpse both the violence of slavery and the love that survives it. I recently finished Javier Zamora's \"Solito,\" about another 9-year-old child, the author himself, who makes the harrowing journey from El Salvador to the U.S.-Mexico border alone, carrying only a black backpack. He makes the trip to reunite with parents he has not seen in years. Written in prose that often has the cadence and energy of poetry and in the voice of the author's younger self, the book is simply unforgettable. Maud Newton's \"Ancestor Trouble\" tells a very different kind of story about family. The author plays the part of detective, uncovering the stories of her ancestors going back many generations and confronting their complicity in indigenous dispossession, slavery and white supremacy. Beyond that, however, the book is a fascinating and wide-ranging meditation on how and why the stories of our own dead matter.</p><p>-- Ms. Ferrer is the author of \"Cuba: An American History,\" winner of the Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>Reggie Fils-Aime</p><p>As a business leader and board director, I'm always looking for practical books that teach important skills in a straightforward way. \"The Prepared Leader,\" by Wharton dean Erika H. James and Simmons University president Lynn Perry Wooten, does just that. The authors provide a research-rich framework and detailed set of tools to help leaders in any field overcome the faulty assumption that crises cannot be anticipated. While you never know exactly when the next problem will arise, every leader can apply critical thinking to anticipate potential issue areas and create a game plan. The authors encourage lateral thinking and diversity of opinion to enable ego-less decision making and quickly get to scalable solutions. It's an engaging read that you will bookmark and highlight to reread and apply.</p><p>-- Mr. Fils-Aime, former president and COO of Nintendo of the Americas, is the author of \"Disrupting the Game.\"</p><p>Marshall Jon Fisher</p><p>Most of my favorite books this year were relics of the 20th century. I finally picked up the two Thomas Bernhard novels that had been taunting me from the bookshelf for years, \"Woodcutters\" and \"Old Masters,\" and enjoyed the dark humor lying within the curmudgeonly prose. Gerald Murnane's \"The Plains\" was another absurdist delight. I also read two fine books about Israel. The first was Colum McCann's novel \"Apeirogon,\" which blends the stories of an Israeli and a Palestinian who each lost a daughter to the region's never-ending violence. Later I revisited Amos Oz's \"A Tale of Love and Darkness,\" his memoir of growing up in Jerusalem and maturing alongside the new state of Israel. Rereading brought me the most literary pleasure. In the 1990s I was captivated by Peter Matthiessen's three \"Mr. Watson\" novels, which explored the lawless world of Florida's fin-de-siecle Ten Thousand Islands region. This year, I experienced them in their final form, fused into the magnum opus \"Shadow Country.\" The greatest reward of all, though, came from reimmersions into Virginia Woolf's two masterpieces, \"Mrs. Dalloway\" and \"To the Lighthouse.\" No better novels have been written, and they yield more treasure each time.</p><p>-- Mr. Fisher is the author, most recently, of \"Seventeen and Oh: Miami, 1972, and the NFL's Only Perfect Season.\"</p><p>Mike Garcia</p><p>\"Red-Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win,\" by Peter Schweizer, is an eye-opening book that highlights a legacy of entanglement that senior U.S. government officials have had with the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, over the last couple of decades. It is particularly relevant to my work in Congress. I co-chair the China Task Force, which is trying to better understand the different ways in which the CCP takes advantage of the U.S. Mr. Schweizer's book provides a deep background on the relationship between the CCP and the U.S. -- the entanglement between our officials and those of China's ruling party has led to the trading of our collective security for the short-term high of profit. If we want to avoid any further harm from that entanglement, we'd better figure out how to disentangle from the CCP -- immediately.</p><p>-- Mr. Garcia is a congressman from California.</p><p>Allen C. Guelzo</p><p>I am a historian and in love with history, so it will surprise no one that almost all of what I read is history or biography. This past year has held a bushel basket of good historical and biographical reading, starting at the top with Henry Kissinger's \"Leadership: Six Studies in World Strategy.\" I did not expect \"Leadership\" to be a historical study. Yet its chapters are gems of historical inquiry into the lives of Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle, Richard Nixon, Anwar Sadat, Lee Kuan Yew and Margaret Thatcher, mixed in each case with Mr. Kissinger's own long-lived interactions with them. I thought Gordon Wood's \"Power and Liberty: Constitutionalism in the American Revolution\" teemed throughout with exceptional insights and understanding of the Revolutionary era. This was also a year for getting reacquainted with the music of Charles Ives, through Jan Swafford's \"Charles Ives: A Life With Music\" and J. Peter Burkholder's \"Charles Ives: The Ideas Behind the Music.\" Nothing, however, quite packed the punch of William Deresiewicz's \"The End of Solitude: Selected Essays on Culture and Society,\" and especially the author's account of why genuine intellectual life has been driven almost completely out of colleges and universities.</p><p>-- Mr. Guelzo is director of the Initiative on Politics and Statesmanship at Princeton's James Madison Program.</p><p>Kevin Hassett</p><p>When I finished \"The Myth of American Inequality: How Government Biases Policy Debate,\" my thoughts ran back to season 9 of the 1980s show \"Dallas.\" (Bear with me.) The entire season, you may recall, was revealed to be a dream -- none of it happened. I have been participating in the public-policy debate with liberal and progressive scholars for years, but it all might just as well have been a dream. This book -- by Auburn University economist Bob Ekelund, economist and consultant John Early, and former U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm -- shows that the political debate over inequality since the 1960s has had almost nothing to do with reality. In short, the books were cooked. When the Census Bureau, which provides the source data everyone uses for inequality, calculates income, it counts only cash income. Nearly every transfer payment -- money redistributed by the government for the purpose of attacking poverty -- is left out! Once you include that money, the bottom half of the income distribution has almost exactly the same income from top to bottom. \"The Myth of American Inequality\" is in my view the most important book published this year.</p><p>-- Mr. Hassett is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and was the 29th Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.</p><p>Heather Havrilesky</p><p>In spite of the current glut of blandly unobjectionable heroes, the protagonists of our best novels are more like difficult lovers. Their bad choices test our limits, but we can't let them go, because they reflect our best and worst selves -- our most shameful, ego-driven impulses and our most honorable principles. In spite of our disapproval we draw closer and empathize, recognizing long-buried desires in their scrabbling and clawing to squeeze more life out of life. In her debut novel, \"Vladimir,\" Julia May Jonas offers up the most seductively unapologetic narrator I've encountered in years, the kind of heroine you sleep with on a whim, marry the next morning, and regret for decades to come. Her attraction to a younger colleague at the liberal-arts college where she and her husband teach becomes a receptacle for all of her thwarted professional ambitions, long-buried romantic aspirations and anxieties about aging. Like a cross between John Updike, Shirley Jackson and Elena Ferrante, Ms. Jonas, who is also an accomplished playwright, weaves together tenacity and longing, curiosity and horror, contempt and delirium into the conflicted DNA of a heroine who no longer has the will to play nicely with others. The result is an unforgettable tale about the impossible conundrum of wanting much more than you deserve -- in other words, being human.</p><p>-- Ms. Havrilesky is the author, most recently, of \"Foreverland: On the Divine Tedium of Marriage.\"</p><p>Hua Hsu</p><p>Jean Chen Ho's \"Fiona and Jane\" is a delightful novel about the erratic rhythms of friendship, following two Taiwanese-American women as they move in and out of each other's lives, from the days of fake IDs and Koreatown bad boys to the self-seriousness of early adulthood, careers, closing horizons, and settling down. It's funny and sad, finely attuned to the microgestures and rituals that mean everything when you're in your teens and 20s, convinced you have a telekinetic bond with your closest friends. Where Ms. Ho's characters are constantly looking for something to do, somewhere to go, Cookie Mueller's life seemed like a dizzying, non-stop adventure. The late writer and actress's collection of stories and riffs, \"Walking Through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black,\" was reprinted this year and I couldn't stop reading it, astounded by the restless energy and insight inflaming each of her sentences. A similar feeling of youthful ecstasy runs through \"122 Hours of Fear,\" a zine edited by Layla Gibbon, who collects stories about going to shows, from dingy basement punk gigs to pyrotechnic arena rap concerts, and all of it makes you want to take in as much beauty as possible and tell the world about it.</p><p>-- Mr. Hsu is the author, most recently, of \"Stay True,\" a memoir.</p><p>Erika H. James</p><p>The book that most strongly stuck with me in 2022 was \"Lead to Win: How to Be a Powerful, Impactful, Influential Leader in Any Environment,\" by Carla A. Harris. Ms. Harris paints a vivid picture of what's required of leaders today as our world has irrevocably changed. As a scholar who has spent a career studying crisis leadership and management strategy, I especially appreciated how Ms. Harris frames modern leadership through the lens of intentionality. These are the qualities that leaders need to hone and manifest every day in order to most effectively influence others and create positive change, things like authenticity, clarity, inclusivity and creating more leaders. The book reads with the same passion and charisma that Ms. Harris exhibits as an inspirational speaker. And it offers the practical \"pearls of wisdom\" that anyone can immediately put into action at any stage of their leadership journey.</p><p>-- Ms. James is dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of \"The Prepared Leader: Emerge From Any Crisis More Resilient Than Before.\"</p><p>Amy Klobuchar</p><p>In Minnesota, our landmark artists are often also literal landmarks. There is Duluth's Bob Dylan Way, St. Paul's Fitzgerald Theater, a statue of Sinclair Lewis in Sauk Centre. And in Minneapolis, just a few miles from Prince's star at First Avenue, there is Birchbark Books, which is owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Louise Erdrich. In Ms. Erdrich's latest novel, \"The Sentence,\" a bookstore inspired by Birchbark Books is brought to life -- and is also haunted by a deceased customer. \"The Sentence\" is deeply personal and profoundly relevant, a fictional yet faithful account of the trials of the pandemic and the racial reckoning in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. It is a magical novel. But for anyone who took on the challenge of leadership during the last few years -- in politics, business or elsewhere -- it is a cathartic reminder to stay grounded in what is good and what matters, even when you don't have all the answers. If you're ever in Minneapolis, be sure to visit Birchbark Books. Until then, reading \"The Sentence\" will pretty much take you there.</p><p>-- Ms. Klobuchar is a senator from Minnesota.</p><p>Dave Limp</p><p>In my leisure reading I alternate between fiction and nonfiction, primarily to keep me from reading only fiction. My favorite novel this year was the recent \"Project Hail Mary\" by Andy Weir, a software-engineer-turned-writer best known as the author of \"The Martian\" (2011). It tells the story of an incredible interstellar adventure but stands out for its profound portrayal of friendship. I loved this book because it reinforced my optimism about people -- and underscored that especially in a time when it seems we are more divided than ever, there is hope that people who are very different can get along and work together. My favorite nonfiction title was \"Einstein: His Life and Universe\" (2007) by Walter Isaacson. There is much to learn from this biography, but for me the big takeaway was just how many paradigm-shifting concepts Einstein put forward -- from relativity to the foundations of quantum theory -- despite the huge number of people who didn't believe them. It's an important reminder that truly innovative ideas are always worth pursuing -- despite the objections of doubters.</p><p>-- Mr. Limp is the senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon.</p><p>J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</p><p>As an author of cookbooks and children's books, nearly everything I read in 2022 falls into these two categories. My 5-and-3/4-year-old Alicia struggles to carry her own backpack just like Tanisha, the protagonist of Pat Zietlow Miller and Jen Hill's recent \"Be Strong.\" It's a wonderfully layered story about community, leadership, kindness and how we're strongest when we help others and let others help us. We loved Ryan T. Higgins's first book in the Penelope Rex series, the hilarious and entertaining \"We Don't Eat Our Classmates\" (2018), so we were delighted to discover its sequel, \"We Will Rock Our Classmates\" (2020). This story about a young T. rex longing to wow her human classmates at the school talent show reminds us that even big scary dinosaurs have fears, and sometimes we need our friends and family to help us rock out with confidence. Among this year's cookbooks I really enjoyed \"The Woks of Life,\" a book full of practical recipes and techniques for Chinese home cooking, uniquely co-authored by the Leungs, a multigenerational Chinese-American family. \"Korean American: Food That Tastes Like Home,\" by Eric Kim, is one of the most exciting and personal books I've read on the Asian-American experience and the way food transforms and can be transformed by it.</p><p>-- Mr. Lopez-Alt is the author of \"The Food Lab\" and, more recently, \"The Wok: Recipes and Techniques.\"</p><p>David Malpass</p><p>Ian Bremmer's \"The Power of Crisis\" presents timely analysis of the overlapping crises we face today and potential transformative solutions. Mr. Bremmer, a leading geopolitical strategist, outlines three threats to global public goods -- pandemics, climate change and ubiquitous digital technologies -- to argue for practical coordination among nations and nonstate actors. The book is worth reading as the world faces a rapidly hardening impasse on many fronts, including the three that Mr. Bremmer highlights. I worry too about slow growth, high inflation, limited supplies and excessive national debt around the world. It's difficult to find an off-ramp when there is a permanent drain on global capital from advanced economies amid overcapitalized governments and businesses. To break the impasse, the world needs to overcome Mr. Bremmer's three threats to global public goods, rely even more on technological innovation and hope for an upheaval in economic policies to achieve broad-based growth that is less dependent on near-zero interest rates, Russian gas and Chinese coal-fired factories.</p><p>-- Mr. Malpass is president of the World Bank Group.</p><p>Lynn Martin</p><p>Recently I enjoyed reading \"Never Enough,\" by Mike Hayes, chief operating officer of VMware. The book offers powerful lessons on teamwork and leadership under the most difficult circumstances. Mike is the former commanding officer of SEAL Team TWO, where he led a 2,000-person special operations task force in Afghanistan. Throughout the book, he shares moving stories of the bravery and sacrifice that he and his task force made for the protection of freedoms for our country and each other. Mike writes that \"high-performing teams -- and not just in the military -- succeed and fail together, with the best players understanding at all moments what will make the mission more successful and what role they need to play to enable that success.\" We all have an important role to play on our teams, and a true leader understands when it's time to provide direction and when it's time to let others step up. All proceeds from the book go to the 1162 Foundation, which helps financially support Gold Star families after a service member is killed in action, making the read even more inspirational.</p><p>-- Ms. Martin is president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Elizabeth McCracken</p><p>I have read many great books this year but suffer from book amnesia, so I will mention only the two works of genuine genius I've most recently encountered. \"Easy Beauty,\" by Chloe Cooper Jones, advertises itself as a memoir, which it is, but it's also several other things: a travelog (Ms. Jones travels through Italy during the course of the book); a philosophical tract (Ms. Jones is a professor of ethics and aesthetics); a meditation on what it is to live in this world with a visible disability (Ms. Jones was born with sacral agenesis, which impairs her stature and her gait); a consideration of what beauty means, what parenthood means, what art and fame mean. If this sounds like too much, it's not: Ms. Jones is a brilliant writer, a composer of stunning sentences that nail down experiences and emotions I would have thought ineffable. I have also been listening to \"David Copperfield\" on audio. Does it have the best opening chapter in all of fiction? Is it my favorite Dickens? The answer to both depends on which Dickens novel I last read, but certainly Betsey Trotwood is my favorite character in all of fiction.</p><p>-- Ms. McCracken is the author, most recently, of the novel \"The Hero of This Book.</p><p>Leila Mottley</p><p>Julie Otsuka's \"The Swimmers\" stuck with me long after I finished it, and I recommend reading it without reading any summary of it beforehand. I really admire the way Ms. Otsuka plays with structure and deftly wields an assortment of points of view. I loved \"Neruda on the Park\" by Cleyvis Natera and the way she writes about the bonds that tie parents to children. I also spent a good portion of this year revisiting the classics, and really loved reading \"Giovanni's Room\" by James Baldwin and returning to read \"The Street\" by Ann Petry for the second time. Both are intricate contemplations on relationships, place, and love in all its forms.</p><p>-- Ms. Mottley is the author of \"Nightcrawling,\" a novel.</p><p>Kristi Noem</p><p>In 2019 I became the first female governor of South Dakota. To get there, I had to fight the good old boys club -- men who told me repeatedly that it wasn't the right time for me and that I needed to wait my turn. This summer, I read Abby Wambach's \"Wolfpack,\" and it gave words to things I've always felt. The book's title refers to the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but Ms. Wambach turns it into a rallying cry: \"You were never Little Red Riding Hood. You were always the wolf.\" She writes about how women should build their own wolfpack -- a group of women who not only defend each other and praise each other's victories, but also demand what they deserve. I don't believe anyone should get a position simply because she is a woman, but something incredibly powerful happens when women have each other's backs. Ms. Wambach's eight rules create a new playbook to change the way women think about leadership. I wish I'd had this perspective when I first ran for Congress in 2010, but I'm grateful I have it now.</p><p>-- Ms. Noem will begin her second term as South Dakota's governor in January.</p><p>Asutosh Padhi</p><p>I've spent much of my career working with industrial technology and manufacturing companies, many of them in America's heartland. These institutions are defined by a resilient, innovative spirit, yet are underappreciated by the media, talent and investors. This may be due to the nature of their business -- many are privately owned, invisible to everyday consumers, and few make it to the cover of papers like this one -- but it's also, in part, due to their location. This is why one of the most energizing books I read this year was Steve Case's \"The Rise of the Rest.\" It chronicles Steve's journey to nurture tech startups in what some might consider \"surprising\" places. Think: Milwaukee vs. Silicon Valley. Over the past decade, 75% of venture capital has gone to just three states: California, New York and Massachusetts. But that doesn't mean those are the only places where innovation is happening. Steve's book is a heroic push encouraging us to widen the aperture. With the right investments and visibility, we can change the American landscape for the better, leveling the playing field and creating a more inclusive economy for years to come.</p><p>-- Mr. Padhi is McKinsey &amp; Company's North America Managing Partner, and co-author of \"The Titanium Economy: How Industrial Technology Can Create a Better, Faster, Stronger America.\"</p><p>Ann Patchett</p><p>Forgive me for cramming in extra recommendations, but I own a bookstore and there are so many books to love, starting with \"Farmhouse,\" the glorious picture book written and illustrated by Sophie Blackall. For older children who like animals and science (I am one of these) get a copy of Brooke Barker's \"How Do Meerkats Order Pizza?\" For adult nonfiction, read the essays of Hanif Abdurraqib (\"A Little Devil in America\") and Judith Thurman (\"A Left-Handed Woman\"): Both authors taught me things I never knew about writing and the world we live in. Fiction was especially rich this year, with the pyrotechnic achievements of Jennifer Egan (\"The Candy House\") and Barbara Kingsolver (\"Demon Copperhead\"), but there were also smaller, quieter books that deserve every bit as much attention: Gish Jen's inter-connected short stories \"Thank You, Mr. Nixon,\" Claire Keegan's novella \"Foster,\" Kevin Wilson's \"Now Is Not the Time to Panic\" and Elizabeth McCracken's \"The Hero of This Book.\" All four of these I read twice, just for the opportunity to marvel. Now I'm listening to Bono read his memoir \"Surrender\" on the Libro.fm app, supporting my local independent bookstore while immersed in a wildly entertaining audiobook.</p><p>-- Ms. Patchett is the proprietor of Parnassus Books in Nashville and the author, most recently, of the essay collection \"These Precious Days.\"</p><p>Lincoln Perry</p><p>On ascending to Mount Parnassus as quasi-deities, those we admire can lose their human traits, all but disappearing in the mists of an impenetrable fame. For many, Henri Matisse has ascended to a dismissible perfection, as well as an unaffordable price range. On a recent visit to Philadelphia, I saw certain lackluster works from the 1930s and '40s that made me wonder why this manifestly wonderful painter ever let them out of the studio. If all Matisses (or all Picassos or Vermeers) are automatically \"great,\" we cease to look critically and therefore stop appreciating the genius that went into the artist's masterpieces. Hilary Spurling's two volumes, \"The Unknown Matisse\" (1998) and \"Matisse the Master\" (2005), helped me realize not only how mocked and reviled the man was at the beginning of his career, but how close he came to losing his gift in the uninspired efforts I encountered in Philadelphia. Ms. Spurling conveys the agonizing struggles and endless toil that resulted in Matisse's early triumphs, as well as his crowning glory in the painted-paper cutouts done shortly before he died. In her expansive biography, Matisse returns to earth, an inspiration to us all.</p><p>-- Mr. Perry, a painter and sculptor, is the author of \"Seeing Like an Artist: What Artists Perceive in the Art of Others.\"</p><p>Timothy Potts</p><p>After another year that has cried out for inspiring leadership, I grasped glimmers of optimism from Matt Waters's \"King of the World,\" a biography of Persian king Cyrus the Great. Oct. 29 was in fact \"Cyrus the Great Day,\" named for his ascendancy 2,561 years ago as the new overlord of Babylon and \"king of the world.\" Having forged an empire from the borders of India and Uzbekistan to Turkey and Egypt, that title wasn't hyperbole. Today Cyrus is revered as a model of pragmatic, benevolent rulership. His tolerant and ecumenical rule extended even to his wardrobe. The sole surviving contemporary image of Cyrus shows him wearing an Elamite robe, Egyptian crown, and the wings of an Assyrian demon. Only his hairstyle is homegrown Persian. (Think of King Charles III in a dhoti, wearing an Oba's crown, and given the wings of the Algonquian thunderbird.) Life in ancient times was no cakewalk. But Cyrus imposed or forbade no religion, language, ethnicity, dress code or culture on his native Persians or the many other peoples he ruled. Would that this were the case for his descendants today.</p><p>-- Mr. Potts is the Maria Hummer-Tuttle and Robert Tuttle Director of the J. Paul Getty Museum.</p><p>David Pryce-Jones</p><p>The story of Moise de Camondo perfectly fits artist and writer Edmund de Waal's intuitive understanding of the world as it once was. \"Letters to Camondo\" takes the form of a series of imaginary letters from the author to the great but unremembered art collector of the title. A cosmopolitan Turkish Jew, Moise de Camondo knew everyone who was anyone in Paris at the end of the 19th century. An unstoppable collector of things made by the greatest French craftsmen and artists, he built a house to show it all off. He had a daughter, Beatrice, and a son, Nissim. In 1917, Nissim volunteered to be a pilot, was often in combat and mentioned in dispatches only to be shot down and killed. A broken Camondo gave his house and collections to the nation, and ever since there seems to be no interest in the family. He died just in time to avoid being murdered, along with his daughter and grandchildren, in Auschwitz. Edmund de Waal's book is a powerful, indeed beautiful, requiem for the forgotten.</p><p>-- Mr. Pryce-Jones is the author, most recently, of \"Openings &amp; Outings: An Anthology.\"</p><p>Vivek Ramaswamy</p><p>The emerging religiosity in the climate-change debate obscures the diversity of questions at issue. Are global surface temperatures indeed rising to problematic levels? Are human beings principally responsible for this effect, and can they reasonably reverse it by altering their behaviors? Steven E. Koonin, in \"Unsettled\" (2021), has shown that the answers to these questions are far more complicated than we've been led to believe. Bjorn Lomborg has recently shown that rising global surface temperatures are likely not the unmitigated evil so many assume. The brilliance of Alex Epstein's recent \"Fossil Future\" is that he writes not as a scientific expert but as a philosopher. Mr. Epstein delivers clarity of thought in a way that only an outsider can. He concedes that man-made climate change is real, but he recenters the debate around the question that matters: What is the best course of action to improve human flourishing? His answer is clear and unapologetic: more plentiful, reliable, abundant access to fossil fuels. The climate-disaster-related death rate, he points out, is 98% lower today than it was just a century ago -- largely owing to innovations powered by fossil fuels. The right way to handle climate change isn't to reverse it but to master its effects -- a thesis that is as provocative as it is intuitive.</p><p>-- Mr. Ramaswamy is the author of \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.\"</p><p>Moshe Safdie</p><p>Moshe Halbertal and Stephen Holmes's \"The Beginning of Politics\" examines the biblical Book of Samuel's political and psychological intricacies and demonstrates it to be the first insight into the complexity of sovereignty and government. I reread Robert Fagles's translation of \"The Odyssey\" during the Covid-19 lockdown. Fifty years after first reading Homer's epic poem, I returned to it with a broadened perspective, and consumed it as if watching a film -- I found it more dramatic, and certainly more imaginative, than any space fantasy I have seen. \"Memoirs of Hadrian,\" by Marguerite Yourcenar, reflects on statesmanship, leadership, ambition, and the potential and limits of power. Richard Saul Wurman's epic publication \"The Notebooks and Drawings of Louis I. Kahn\" (1962) expressed Kahn's method, philosophy and poetic words. Recently republished, along with new anecdotes, photographs, and essays, the book shows why Kahn's stature as one of the great American architects stands firm.</p><p>-- Mr. Safdie is the author of \"If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\"</p><p>Bozoma Saint John</p><p>In February, I made a big, scary change in my life. I left my role as the chief marketing officer of Netflix without another job lined up. It came after more than two decades of breakneck-speed career climbing at Endeavor, Uber, Apple and Pepsi. And suddenly, I stopped. It was the perfect time to pick up a book written by one of my best friends, Luvvie Ajayi Jones's \"Professional Troublemaker: The Fear-Fighter Manual.\" The book embodies the audacity we often need when we make the tough but right decision in life. I've been a disruptor in many spaces, and haven't been afraid to shake things up. But sometimes, we all need to borrow a little courage to do things differently. This book helped me do just that. As I prepare to publish my memoir, I've taken lessons from Luvvie's book to get ready to step into my new chapter and cause \"good trouble.\"</p><p>-- Ms. Saint John's memoir \"The Urgent Life: My Story of Love, Loss, and Survival\" will be published in February.</p><p>Maria Salazar</p><p>In 1991, I was Central America's bureau chief at Univision, the most prominent network for Latin Americans in the United States. I covered the civil war in El Salvador, where the FMLN guerrillas used extreme violence against the state. Javier Zamora's childhood memoir, \"Solito,\" details his 3,000-mile journey alone from El Salvador to the United States. Reading about El Salvador brought back memories of the war, where ultimately my life was threatened. I sought protection at the American Embassy. My trust in America as a safe haven was instinctive -- a blessing that I never questioned. Heart-wrenching and beautifully detailed, Mr. Zamora's story feels too heavy to have been repeated by anyone else. Truthfully, the U.S. holds millions of untold stories just like this one. Everyone should know what I knew in 1991 -- that America is both a refuge for those escaping violence and persecution, and fertile ground for hard-working immigrants with dreams of a better life. \"Solito\" is an unfinished story.</p><p>-- Ms. Salazar is a congresswoman from Florida.</p><p>Surbhi Sarna</p><p>I've always used books to either better understand my current reality or escape it, and 2022 was no different. As I transitioned from being an entrepreneur to a venture capitalist focused on biology, I wanted to better understand how innovation in health care can go wrong. \"Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty,\" by Patrick Radden Keefe, tells the terrifying story of how one family's greed contributed to, and may have caused, the opioid crisis in the U.S. I also reread \"Bad Blood,\" by John Carreyrou, which pieces together the rise and fall of Theranos. It reminded me of the importance of keeping health entrepreneurs focused on the patients they ultimately serve. When I was done scaring myself, I turned to lighter reading. Andrew Shvarts's \"It Ends in Fire\" is about a strong heroine who becomes an undercover spy at a school that teaches magic as she plots revenge on the system that destroyed her family. Oh, 2022, what a year, and I'm grateful for the books that helped me get through it.</p><p>-- Ms. Sarna is a group partner at Y Combinator and the author of \"Without a Doubt: How to Go From Underrated to Unbeatable.\"</p><p>Lionel Shriver</p><p>Ever since researching my own fictional contribution to the field, \"Game Control\" (1994), I've been fascinated by demography, whose inputs (longevity, women's rights, disease, little stuff like what people see as the meaning of life) are as complex as its outputs (political power, war, economic success, little stuff like whether we thrive or implode as a species). If you're interested in how this century is apt to play out, I recommend two highly readable books that I devoured in quick succession: Edward Paice's \"Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World\" and Paul Morland's \"Tomorrow's People: The Future of Humanity in Ten Numbers.\" While Southeast Asia, Europe and even China dwindle, by 2100 arid Africa's population is almost certain to exceed 4 billion. From either liberalism or cowardice Mr. Paice won't touch the scary subject with a barge pole, but he lays out stats that surely translate into mass African migration into Europe, which is bound to make the crisis of 2015 look like a school field trip. Mr. Morland addresses this prospect more honestly, while reserving judgment. Top off your reading with Douglas Murray's courageous \"The Strange Death of Europe,\" which suggests this future appeals to most Europeans like a hole in the head. My literary triptych augurs that trouble awaits.</p><p>-- Ms. Shriver is the author, most recently, of the essay collection \"Abominations.\"</p><p>Ed Stack</p><p>I love the saying \"It takes 20 years to make an overnight success.\" Many people don't realize how long it takes to become successful. \"The Ride of a Lifetime\" by Robert Iger and \"Play Nice but Win\" by Michael Dell help put the journey into perspective. For Mr. Iger, succeeding Michael Eisner as CEO of Disney was a challenge. Whether standing up to his predecessor or the Disney family, he was resolute in his vision. I can't wait to see how he navigates his next chapter as he shifts back to the CEO position. I was inspired by Mr. Dell's story of how, as a college kid with a passion for computers, he started a business. Like Mr. Iger, Mr. Dell never let his vision be dimmed by those around him who suggested he take a more traditional path. From the battle with Carl Icahn to take the company private to taking it public again, along with his acquisition strategy, he was definitely playing to win. Both books resonated deeply with my own experiences and are valuable for anyone trying to understand the importance of seeing around corners, stay- ing true to your vision and never giving up.</p><p>-- Mr. Stack is executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods.</p><p>Morgan Talty</p><p>My reading, which had slowed during the pandemic, ramped back up with what felt like a surge in literature published and showcased in magazines and journals. One book that has stuck with me -- and that I think about daily -- is Joseph Han's novel \"Nuclear Family.\" This book is genius. I mean it. The members of the Cho family run several restaurants made famous by Guy Fieri; they are full of humanity and love and passion. The story is grounded strongly in the real world, but stretches out into the fantastic: a ghost, who takes over the body of one of the Cho children, gets stuck, literally, between North and South Korea. The narrative is inventive, and the prose is too: upside-down sentences, scrambled language, erased words. None of this is distracting; it only enhances the reading experience. Oh, and the book is funny. No. Hilarious. \"Nuclear Family\" woke me up from the deep slumber of Covid and brought me back to life. I'm sure it will do the same for every reader.</p><p>-- Mr. Talty is the author of the story collection \"Night of the Living Rez.\"</p><p>Abraham Verghese</p><p>For many of us in health care, 2022 felt like a gift compared to the two preceding years. Still, I was restless, anxious about Covid-19's next chapter. \"The Family Jewels,\" by the Irish stand-up comedian/writer Caimh McDonnell. was just the medicine. It's the most recent volume in his Dublin Trilogy . . . which has seven books. (I know.) For which I am grateful, because I couldn't get enough of Detective Bunny McGarry and gang -- their adventures are poignant, suspenseful and gut-bustingly funny. Hearing the audio version read by an Irishman enhances the experience. \"A Burning,\" by Megha Majumdar, is a brilliant novel I gifted to friends. Through the lens of just a few characters, the author evokes the complexity, the injustice and corruption experienced by urban Indians living in poverty. Finally, \"The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois,\" by Honoree Fanonne Jeffers, is simply the best book I've read in a long while. This epic set in Georgia pulls you in with poetic language and characters who jump off the page. When I reached the end I'd lived through several generations . . . and yet it was just Tuesday! That's the power of great fiction: to stop time, and to convey a kind of truth that is timeless.</p><p>-- Dr. Verghese is the author of \"Cutting for Stone\" and the forthcoming \"The Covenant of Water.\"</p><p>Adrian Nathan West</p><p>My friends tried forever to get me to read Gary Indiana. I finally did, and now he's a writer I can't imagine living without. An arresting stylist with a demolitionist's instincts, he's indispensable for anyone interested in America's darkest corners. His newly released collection of essays, \"Fire Season,\" is a poison delight. If you try to imagine Descartes born black in Kansas City, wending his way to posh and provincial Switzerland after World War II to meditate on the basic questions of existence, you'll have some sense of Vincent O. Carter's nearly forgotten \"The Bern Book,\" reprinted this past summer for the first time in 40-plus years. Another re-release, one that crosses centuries, is Yasmine Seale's translation of \"The Annotated Arabian Nights.\" Edward Said and postcolonial studies gave exoticism a bad name, but this new edition reminds us how marvelous the exotic can be. Genies, flying horses, men transformed to dogs -- all this is nectar for the imagination, and scholar Paulo Lemos Horta's introduction and notes illuminate these ancient stories' origins as well as the translations, adaptations, and even misreadings that made them classics of world literature.</p><p>-- Mr. West is the author of \"My Father's Diet\" and a translator of books from German, Spanish and Catalan.</p><p>Jaap van Zweden</p><p>\"Beacon to the World: A History of Lincoln Center,\" by Joseph W. Polisi, president emeritus of the Juilliard School, is a powerful work of nonfiction with the drama of a novel. It came out not long before the opening of the new David Geffen Hall in October, and chronicles the controversial history of Lincoln Center from the 1950s, complete with decades of power brokers and challenges right up until the gut renovation of Geffen Hall. For the first decade of its existence, the venue was called Philharmonic Hall and then was known for more than 40 years as Avery Fisher Hall. The transformation of this concert hall, which is home to the New York Philharmonic, comes not a moment too soon, as readers will appreciate from Mr. Polisi's masterful book.</p><p>-- Mr. van Zweden is music director of the New York Philharmonic.</p>",
