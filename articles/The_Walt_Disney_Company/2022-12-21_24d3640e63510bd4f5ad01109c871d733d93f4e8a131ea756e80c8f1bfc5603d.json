  "text": "<p>Good morning. This is our last letter of 2022, and it has been a fascinating (if not profitable) 12 months in markets. We love what we do, and without readers, we wouldn't get paid for doing it. So a very big thank you to everyone who spends a few minutes with us every morning, and especially to those of you who have written to us with ideas, counterarguments, complaints, anecdotes and encouragement. We wish you all a prosperous 2023. Email us any time: <a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a> and <a href=\"mailto:ethan.wu@ft.com\">ethan.wu@ft.com</a>.</p> <h1>The BoJ: yield curve slightly less controlled</h1> <p>The Bank of Japan wants you to think it doubled its 10-year yield cap yesterday, from 25 basis points to 50bp, because it loves smooth market functioning. Specifically, it wanted to iron out the “kink” in Japan's yield curve created by an artificially low 10-year yield. The policy change did help, a bit:</p> <p>But no one really believes this explanation, for the simple reason that, effectively, the BoJ <em>is</em> the Japanese bond market. It owns half of all government bonds. Here is James Athey of Abrdn: “There has been a long downward trend for a long time in volume and activity [in the JGB market]. So to make that decision, in a late December meeting, with that justification? I just don't buy it.”</p> <p>A more popular way to think about the higher yield cap is as the opening gun for tighter Japanese monetary policy. The country isn't exempt from the global tightening cycle and, as a very weak yen and the imported cost inflation it brings squeeze real incomes, Japan can sit it out no longer. </p> <p>Here's Mohamed El-Erian on Bloomberg TV making the case:</p> <blockquote>  <p>What they're trying to do is an orderly, slow exit from an unsustainable monetary policy regime. Now, they can't say that, but that's what they're trying to do. </p>  <p>They did two things today that were quite smart. First, they increased QE [meaning] no immediate testing of the [yield] ceiling. Second, they've chosen a low liquidity period to do this . ..</p>  <p>There's no doubt in my mind that this is a step towards normalisation, but they're trying to make it a really long process, as unexciting as possible, so that it doesn't force selling by Japanese institutions . . . . They've seen what happens in the UK when you shock the government bond market . . . The genie is out of the bottle.</p> </blockquote> <p>A great sum of money has been staked on this view, either as 10-year JGB shorts or yen longs. As Athey noted to us yesterday, investors in these trades like their asymmetric pay-off — inexpensive to fund with strong upside potential. For a yield curve control sceptic, yesterday was great. Yields popped and the yen stiffened against the dollar, a big impact for a wee policy fiddle. One JGB short told the FT he was now betting on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fb65afc-4189-48ee-b8bd-081e94b52171\">10-year yield rising</a> another 50bp to 1 per cent.</p> <p>But reading yesterday's commentary, we couldn't shake the feeling that some market participants might be overreacting. Sure, the BoJ is letting some air out of the balloon, but thinking it must tighten further rests on an assumption that YCC is urgently unsustainable. We are not so sure. </p> <p>One reason is peak YCC pain could well be behind us. Karthik Sankaran, senior FX wizard at Corpay, points out the biggest burdens dragging down the yen are starting to lighten: the pace of Fed rate increases, which lure capital out of Japan, and the global energy shock hurting its trade balance. With the US central bank slowing down and oil prices falling, pressure to unspool YCC to boost the yen is diminishing.</p> <p>Another reason is that underlying inflation remains too low and growth too vulnerable for monetary policy to tighten much. As Thomas Mathews of Capital Economics wrote yesterday:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Nothing in today's statement suggests that the wider band heralds a wholesale tightening of monetary policy . . . the increase in the bank's scheduled JGB purchases to a six-year high underlines that the bank isn't throwing in the towel on Yield Curve Control.</p>  <p>A global downturn will soon start to weigh on exports and as firms become more cautious, we expect them to slash capital expenditure. Meanwhile, government rebates to electricity prices will knock off around 1 percentage point from inflation from January and the strengthening of the yen in recent months means that food inflation will peak by mid-2023. Finally, services inflation is still subdued and wage growth continues to fall well short of the 3 per cent mark the bank would like to see.</p> </blockquote> <p>Notable, too, is that Haruhiko Kuroda, the BoJ governor, will be replaced next year. That suggests a very simple explanation: Kuroda might want to leave his successor a clean slate. As Sankaran put it:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I read it more as something personal that may have developed over the course of conversations with the Ministry of Finance or with [Kuroda's] potential successor within the BoJ. To me it was like [Kuroda's successor saying], “Guys, why do I have to clean up this mess? Can you clean it up on your way out?”</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometimes a tweak is just a tweak or, perhaps, a favour. (<em>Wu &amp; Armstrong</em>)</p> <h1>Picking stocks in 2023: a dilemma</h1> <p>It was a rough year for stocks from almost every sector. Here is the scorecard as of Tuesday:</p> <p>Energy stocks were fantastic. Defensive stocks (utilities, consumer staples, healthcare) at least kept you out of trouble. Industrials, somewhat mysteriously, were merely poor. Every other sector stank.</p> <p>Investors are positioned for more rough weather. According to the Bank of America Fund Managers' Survey, after government bonds, professional investors are most overweight healthcare, staples, and cash, and they still hate tech and consumer discretionary. BofA's chart:</p> <p>Unhedged thinks picking stocks is hard. But we think there are a few candles that help drive away the darkness. One is mean reversion. Another is valuation, especially at this moment, when value stocks are especially cheap. The two charts above make us inclined to look for bargains in tech and discretionary, and get away from healthcare and staples stocks that may have run too far. </p> <p>One point to keep in mind is that the results in several sectors have been distorted by the very poor performance of a few very large stocks. Amazon and Tesla together make up 36 per cent of the S&amp;P consumer discretionary sector, and they are down 58 and 49 per cent, respectively, this year. Google, Meta, Disney and Netflix make up two-thirds of the communication services sector. They have all had terrible years. So stock pickers have to think carefully about those big names when making sector bets.</p> <p>But the bigger issue that complicates the stock picking in the year to come is recession. Most people, us included, think we are likely to get one, courtesy of the Fed's rate increases. The yield curve is shouting recession about as loud as loudly as it can. In a recession, the very defensive sectors that ran up this year should continue to do well, and value stocks — which tend to be economically sensitive — will probably have larger declines in earnings. Cheap stocks might get cheaper still. </p> <p>So stock pickers face an unpleasant choice in the new year. They can bargain shop, focusing on economically sensitive value stocks or big tech names that have momentum working against them; or they can pile into overpriced defensive names, on the promise that these will decline less in a recession. The bargain shoppers are, in the short term, making a risky contrarian bet against a recession, but if they can hold on until the economy recovers, their portfolios could take back any recessionary underperformance. Those who are staying defensive, by contrast, can expect mediocre returns that will look respectable in relative terms, and hope they can time a portfolio repositioning ahead of the recovery. Hard choices. </p> <h1>One good read</h1> <p>The New England Patriots terrible fall from grace, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/patriots-raiders-nfl-lateral-chandler-jones-belichick-11671423595?mod=wsjhp_columnists_pos3\">as told</a> by Jason Gay.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong &amp; Ethan Wu 2022 'The BoJ flinches, but only a little' FT.com 21 December.
