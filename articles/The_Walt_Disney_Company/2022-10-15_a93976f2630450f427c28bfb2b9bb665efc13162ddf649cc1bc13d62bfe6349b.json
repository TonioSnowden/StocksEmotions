  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Murdoch's News Corp, Fox Weigh Reuniting",
  "text": "<p>Reuniting the companies would bring Mr. Murdoch's highest-profile properties back under one roof. Fox Corp . owns Fox News and the Fox broadcast network, along with local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service. News Corp is the parent company of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the U.K. and Australia.</p><p>Mr. Murdoch is executive chairman of News Corp and chairman of Fox Corp . His son Lachlan Murdoch is co-chairman of News Corp and executive chair and chief executive of Fox .</p><p>The Murdoch family trust has a roughly 39% voting stake in News Corp and about a 42% voting stake in Fox Corp ., according to securities filings from the companies. The trust's ownership of the combined company would be expected to stay roughly around those levels.</p><p>A merger of the two companies would likely be structured as a stock deal, some of the people familiar with the situation said. The exchange ratio -- reflecting the relative value of each company -- would be negotiated by the board committees of independent directors, they said. Fox Corp . had a market value of about $17 billion as of the close of trading Friday, while News Corp 's was about $9 billion.</p><p>In a memo to staff, News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson confirmed the company has formed a special committee to consider the idea of reuniting with Fox Corp . \"At News Corp , we are constantly pursuing ways to enhance our performance and expand our businesses, and the upheaval in media presents both challenges and opportunities,\" he wrote. \"However, I would like to stress that the Special Committee has not made any determination at this time, and there can be no certainty that any transaction will result from its evaluation.\"</p><p>Mr. Murdoch, 91 years old, built an empire over several decades, turning an Australian newspaper company into a global business spanning publishing, entertainment and TV news.</p><p>In 2013, Mr. Murdoch split up his holdings. The publishing assets went into a new publicly traded company, which took on the company's legacy name, News Corp . The other business, including TV and film assets, was named 21st Century Fox and eventually became Fox Corp .</p><p>The logic of the split was that print publishing assets were thought to be a drag on the growing entertainment businesses. Some investors had long pushed for the move. News Corp was sorting out legal issues, and had taken hundreds of millions of dollars in charges related to investigations into phone hacking at its U.K. newspaper division.</p><p>Six years after the split, Mr. Murdoch took stock of his holdings again, concluding that Fox wasn't well positioned to compete with entertainment giants such as Netflix Inc . as the industry was shifting aggressively into streaming video.</p><p>He agreed to sell the majority of Fox 's entertainment holdings, which then also included the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and Star India business, to Walt Disney Co . in a deal valued at $71.3 billion. The remaining assets that didn't go to Disney became the core of the new Fox Corp .</p><p>The engine of Fox Corp . is Fox News, which contributed a significant portion of the almost $14 billion in revenue the company posted for the fiscal year ended June. Fox News and Fox Corp . are facing defamation lawsuits by voting-machine firms stemming from remarks Fox News anchors and guests made alleging widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Fox has denied wrongdoing, defending itself on First Amendment grounds and saying it was covering newsworthy matters.</p><p>News Corp posted revenue of $10.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, up 11% from the previous year, powered primarily by growth in the real estate and Dow Jones units.</p>",
