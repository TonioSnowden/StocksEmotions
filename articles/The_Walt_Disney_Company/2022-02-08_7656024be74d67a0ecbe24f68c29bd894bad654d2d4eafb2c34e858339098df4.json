  "title": "The BBC at 100 — the past and future of a British institution",
  "text": "<p>Everyone has an opinion about the BBC. One day, it is pandering to the masses; the next it is arrogant, elitist and out of touch. Then again, the “middlebrow” path can be perilous too. In the early days of radio, the author Virginia Woolf worried that BBC studio heads were too busy catering to an audience not in her native edgy Bloomsbury but in respectably dull South Kensington. </p> <p>In 2022, when the BBC celebrates its centenary and its future lies in some doubt, it is time for a little perspective. Therein lies the value of David Hendy's new history of the BBC. His is a tale of creative endeavour and technological innovation, beset by a constant tension between leading and following the audience. In the UK, where jealous newspaper rivals and hostile politicians have kicked lumps out of the institution known semi-affectionately as “Auntie”, holding the nation's attention and respect has seemingly become an impossible task. </p> <p>In the founding years, in the aftermath of first world war, life was more straightforward. The BBC was guided by a “High Victorian paternalism” embodied by its first director-general, John Reith. A strict Presbyterian Scot standing 6ft6, Reith cut an intimidating figure with a three-inch gunshot wound from the war scarring his face. His edict was “to bring the best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement” into every home in the land. The mission to inform, educate and entertain — accompanied by inevitable stumbles — was the basis for the BBC's evolution into a model of public service broadcasting.</p> <p>At various moments, the BBC has contributed indelibly to the national consciousness: the televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II; the funeral of Winston Churchill; David Attenborough's <em>Life on Earth</em> series; and the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics which brought together the “Beeb” and the NHS in an orchestrated celebration of “Britishness”. The BBC embodies the national identity, but its influence stretches worldwide. The World Service — where my father spent two happy decades in the 1960s and 1970s — still reaches 468mn people per week, broadcasting in 42 different languages. Alongside the monarchy, the BBC remains one of the two main pillars of British “soft power”.</p> <p>At the beginning of his book, Hendy, a media historian, asks: “Is a history of the BBC even possible?”. The BBC has already broadcast between 10mn and 20mn programmes. (Any attempt to count precisely would take years, he claims). Asa Briggs, a fellow academic, took 35 years and five volumes to write an earlier history, <em>The</em> <em>Birth of Broadcasting,</em> which he started in 1957. Hendy packs 100 years into just over 600 pages — just enough space to squeeze in <em>The Archers</em>, the 1926 general strike and <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>, but no room, alas, for Brexit news coverage or <em>Match of the Day</em>. </p> <p>His approach is part broadcasting history, part social history. Listeners, viewers and broadcasters are joined umbilically via “A People's History”, very much a BBC standards-compliant subtitle. At times, the author feels obliged to refer to Margaret Thatcher's “Maoist phase” (really?) or take a swipe at Kenneth Clark's 12-part series <em>Civilisation</em>. In 1969, this was a cultural awakening for the British public, but Hendy castigates his “great man” theory for excluding Africa, Asia and Islam and giving short shrift to women. In retrospect, he may have a point but Clark, the arch toff, was a creature of his times.</p> <p>Hendy does capture the idealism of the extraordinary group of people led by Reith making a new world: Cecil Lewis, a handsome 20-something flying ace married to the daughter of an exiled White Russian general; Arthur Burrows, a former teacher turned wireless expert; Guglielmo Marconi, whom Hendy sniffly dismisses as “a young Italian with little knowledge of physics but a limitless gift for self-promotion”; and Hilda Matheson, a fluent linguist, MI5 counter-espionage agent and social networker who became the first head of the radio phenomenon known as “Talks”.</p> <p>The new format involved eminent speakers reading aloud meticulously edited scripts in front of a microphone in a box room in Savoy Hill near the Strand, the BBC's first headquarters. Star writers turned up such as JB Priestley, EM Forster and George Bernard Shaw, as well as David Lloyd George (though the former prime minister, a natural orator, suffered speaker's cramp in the absence of a physical audience).</p> <p>A fresh influx of talent arrived in the 1930s as thousands of refugees fled fascism in Europe. The BBC Empire Service (later renamed the World Service) and the BBC Monitoring Service (an eavesdropping operation harvesting vast amounts of information from the world's airwaves) included luminaries such as Martin Esslin, the Austrian author, George Weidenfeld, the future publisher, and Ernst Gombrich, the art historian. It was Gombrich who first guessed Hitler was dead after hearing German radio playing a Bruckner symphony. (He knew the piece had been written to mark Wagner's death — a timely reminder to BBC mandarins about the value of institutional memory.)</p> <p>As a public corporation dependent since 1946 on a licence fee levied on the public, the BBC remains both financially dependent on the state but nominally editorially independent. This has always been an awkward compromise, especially at times of national crisis such as the general strike, the second world war and Suez in 1956.</p> <p>Alan Bullock, the Oxford historian who worked at the BBC during the war, describes the relationship as “a constant pull and push”. The government's efforts to turn the BBC into a propaganda outfit foundered on passive resistance and back-channel compromises. But the BBC did agree to allow secret code to wartime resistance fighters to be inserted into its news broadcasts (sometimes with unintentionally comic results). After the war, it engaged at times in self-censorship, generously interpreting matters of “controversy” and sticking too long to the 14-day rule prohibiting discussion of any issue arising in Parliament over the next fortnight.</p> <p>As the BBC grew bigger, with radio and television channels proliferating, the boundaries of good taste and sound judgment expanded. The broadcasting monopoly became untenable. Hendy highlights, a little grudgingly, the benefits of competition. ITV forced the BBC to up its game in TV drama and documentary; pirate radio operating off the coast of England obliged the BBC to pick up the pace with pop music, hiring stars such as Tony Blackburn, Annie Nightingale and the lugubrious John Peel.</p> <p>Hendy is less sure-footed in his assessment of BBC journalism. While he singles out triumphs such as coverage of the fall of the Soviet Union, he does not give enough credit to John Birt's reforms emphasising specialism or enough criticism to coverage of the Brexit referendum, where a weak-kneed BBC embraced neutrality in the face of falsehoods on both sides, especially the Leave campaign. </p> <p>Since Thatcher, the voices calling for the BBC to be cut down to size have grown louder. Successive governments have tried to pack the board of governors overseeing the BBC. The Daily Mail, a critic since the 1920s, has accused the BBC of smugness and “cultural Marxism”. Rupert Murdoch's newspapers have never ceased to take potshots, rarely conceding they are hopelessly conflicted because of their own rival print and television interests in the UK. </p> <p>Toward the end, Hendy portrays an institution under siege. Top managers have wilted in the face of scandals, notably the Jimmy Savile affair involving a paedophile TV personality gone rogue. These low points overshadow real technological breakthroughs such as the iPlayer and “Project Kangaroo”, the 2007 initiative that would have brought together the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 in a single UK-based point-of-delivery video on demand service.</p> <p>Director-general Mark Thompson's visionary plan was blocked by the Competition Commission after lobbying from commercial operators such as Murdoch's Sky and Virgin Media. In retrospect, this looks like a serious misjudgement. A BBC platform operating at scale would have offered first-mover advantage against US giants led by Amazon, Disney and Netflix now dominant in the content and streaming space. </p> <p>Instead, the BBC has been put on rations. Since 2010, Conservative governments have forced the BBC to swallow a 30 per cent real cut in funding, including taking on the cost of the World Service, previously funded by the Foreign Office. Last month, culture secretary Nadine Dorries, a pulp fiction author and one-time reality TV show contestant, suggested scrapping the TV licence fee levied on the public by 2027, without any serious discussion about alternatives. Thankfully, this act of vandalism was blocked by the rest of the cabinet.</p> <p>In a fragmented media landscape, where disinformation and social media hold sway, the BBC's role is arguably more important than ever. The government last year boasted that the BBC was the world's most trusted broadcaster, an essential part of “Global Britain's” aim to be a “soft power superpower” — an all-too-familiar mismatch of rhetoric and action. </p> <p>By all means, open the debate about future funding mechanisms for the BBC. But beware benign neglect or, worse, yet another act of self-harm. The BBC — and the nation — deserve better.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1781255253/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1781255253&amp;linkId=577ba86daa8a868c5cfba8c3b91f4e26\"><strong>The BBC</strong></a><strong>: A People's History</strong> by David Hendy, <em>Profile £25, 638 pages</em></p> <p><em>Lionel Barber is a former editor of the Financial Times</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09b51729-46fe-45db-a4be-865adc0fc887\"><em>Clark's ‘Civilisation' avoids cultural appropriation / From David Owen, Lewes, East Sussex, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Lionel Barber 2022 'The BBC at 100 — the past and future of a British institution' FT.com 8 February.
