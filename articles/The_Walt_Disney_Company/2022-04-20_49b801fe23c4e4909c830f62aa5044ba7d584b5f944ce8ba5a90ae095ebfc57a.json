  "title": "Florida Senate Passes Bill to Eliminate Disney's Special Tax District; Republican-led House is expected to approve measure, as state takes aim at company's opposition to gender and sexuality legislation",
  "text": "<p>The measure potentially delivers a blow to the company's operations in the state. The special district, created in 1967 and known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, exempts Disney from a host of regulations and certain taxes and fees related to emergency services and road maintenance. It saves Disney tens of millions of dollars a year, according to a person familiar with the company's finances who studied the issue over a decade ago.</p><p>On Wednesday, Disney declined to comment on the bill</p><p>In recent weeks, Mr. DeSantis and GOP lawmakers have clashed with Disney over the company's opposition to the recently signed Parental Rights in Education law, which critics call the \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation. The measure prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity through third grade, and limits it for older students to material that is \"age-appropriate.\"</p><p>Disney initially didn't comment on the legislation, but came under pressure from employees to oppose it. After it passed, the company pledged to push for its repeal and to fight similar bills in other states.</p><p>Under the bill passed by the Senate 23-16 on Wednesday, any special district established before the ratification of the Florida Constitution in 1968, and not renewed since then, would be dissolved on June 1, 2023.</p><p>The legislation affects a half-dozen districts across the state, but only Reedy Creek involves a high-profile company, according to Republican Rep. Randy Fine, the bill's sponsor. Disney could seek to re-establish a special district after the Reedy Creek district's dissolution.</p><p>Reedy Creek, which has its own board of supervisors and fire department, allows Disney to oversee land use and environmental protections. It encompasses four theme parks, two water parks, a sports complex and hotels, stores and restaurants.</p><p>The effect on Disney and the land covered by the district is unclear. Jurisdiction over the property would likely pass to either Orange County or Osceola County.</p><p>\"It is difficult to estimate what a dissolution of [Reedy Creek] would cost Disney over time,\" said Michael Rinaldi, head of U.S. Local Government Ratings at Fitch Ratings. It \"would eliminate access to tax-exempt debt issuance via [Reedy Creek], potentially costing Disney and other landowners within the district more to finance various projects,\" he added.</p><p>Disney employs nearly 80,000 people in the state, mostly at its theme parks and resorts. It is also a significant driver of the tourism industry in Orlando, Fla. According to Visit Orlando, tourism to the area contributes $5.8 billion in local and state tax revenue yearly when operating at full capacity.</p><p>Robbie Whelan contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Florida Senate Passes Bill to Eliminate Disney's Special Tax District</p>",
