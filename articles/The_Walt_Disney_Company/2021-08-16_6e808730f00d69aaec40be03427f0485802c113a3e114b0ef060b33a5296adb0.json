  "title": "The New Workplace (A Special Report) --- Keeping That Pandemic Togetherness: Many families bonded during lockdown. They don't want to lose that.",
  "text": "<p>The first step, experts say, is simply wanting to keep that togetherness. \"It starts with an awareness by parents that this was good,\" says Nicholas Aradi, a psychologist in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.</p><p>Once parents see the value, they need to put the past year and a half under the microscope. \"For those families who found the pandemic beneficial, it's useful to think about what drew them closer,\" says Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychology professor at Brigham Young University. \"Was it having meals every day? Playing games? Make that a part of your new routine.\"</p><p>Drew Martin, a 56-year-old technology consultant in San Diego, and his three children (ages 25, 22 and 20), have been able to continue some of the activities that strengthened their ties during the pandemic.</p><p>One of those activities is surfing, which the family began doing once the local beaches opened.</p><p>Mr. Martin, who is single, had little experience with the sport before the pandemic. But as gyms shut down, surfing gave him a chance to get exercise and be with his kids at the same time. \"I just enjoy being out on the waves with them,\" Mr. Martin says. And they apparently enjoy it, too, because they continue to invite him along even as their lives have started to return to normal.</p><p>During the pandemic's peak, the Martins also enjoyed small social gatherings, including an impromptu performance on their patio by out-of-work musicians who are friends of his son. They passed the virtual Venmo hat afterward. Now they are planning the next music night, with a lot more people invited.</p><p>Another makeshift social event for the Martins during Covid was a socially distanced winter holiday party on the patio, including friends of the Martin children who were unable to travel home to see their families. His children want to have the party again this year.</p><p>\"We had to break traditions, but hopefully we did things that can become future traditions,\" Mr. Martin says.</p><p>The family of Beau River, a 44-year-old partner at Vantage Leadership Consulting in Chicago, has particularly enjoyed outdoor experiences during the pandemic -- hiking, gardening and just goofing around. And they will continue to do those activities, Mr. River says, with a focus on vacations related to nature.</p><p>He says he learned through the pandemic that \"peak\" experiences, such as the family's annual visits to Walt Disney World, are less important for his children (ages 6 and 9) than his \"consistent\" presence. \"What the kids remember is that you're around,\" he says.</p><p>To stay around them more, Mr. River is now generally going to the office only two days a week, compared with four days pre-Covid.</p><p>\"On days when my wife [a nurse] goes to work, I plan on being at home and unplugging at 5 p.m. to be present with my kids and play before dinner,\" he says.</p><p>They are doing many of the activities they started during the pandemic -- such as playing board games, doing puzzles, kicking around a soccer ball, and taking bike rides and walks. These kinds of activities have a different, less-pressured feel than the typical pre-pandemic activities, such as basketball practice or homework. That's one of the reasons they don't want to give them up.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, Kerry Gaertner Gerbracht, a 42-year-old art consultant and mother of an 8-year-old in Brooklyn, worked outside the home, usually 50 to 60 hours a week. She lost her job early in the pandemic and started freelancing from home. She liked it so much that she plans to continue, even when normal life returns.</p><p>\"Being home more, I'm more involved with my son's day-to-day life,\" Ms. Gerbracht says. \"I can do more with him, like taking him bike riding and to the playground after school. Going to the beach is our favorite activity.\"</p><p>She can spend more time with her husband, too. The family has taken road trips to upstate New York and Cape Cod.</p><p>One activity from the pandemic that's important for families to continue is eating together, says Alexandra Solomon, a psychologist and psychology professor at Northwestern University. \"Research shows that families that eat together a few times a week have less conflict and more closeness.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Weil is a writer in West Palm Beach, Fla.
