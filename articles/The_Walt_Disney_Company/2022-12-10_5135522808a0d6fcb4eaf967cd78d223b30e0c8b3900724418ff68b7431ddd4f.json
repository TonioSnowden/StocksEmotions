  "title": "REVIEW  ---  Back When:  What I Learned  Growing Up With the  Gritty Movies of the '70s  ----  By Rich Cohen",
  "text": "<p>   According to his new memoir \"Cinema Speculation,\" Quentin Tarantino learned movies as a child not by watching Disney cartoons but by tagging along with his mom when she went to see whatever she wanted. The world wasn't made for kids in the 1970s. Most of the movies of pre-Spielberg Hollywood were what we'd now consider inappropriate. Those of us who were young at the time simply hoped to take what we could from the experience. If you picture an 11-year-old Mr. Tarantino eating popcorn as he watches \"Deliverance,\" you'll see pre-internet America in a drop of rain. </p><p>   I grew up in much the same way as Mr. Tarantino. \"Chinatown\" was the first movie I saw in a theater, at age 6. I imagine that, like me, nothing was explained to him, that he was left to grapple with the horrors and mysteries of the adult world alone. The trying and failing to understand, the not getting it, formed his sensibility; the explanations he invented to keep the story rolling taught him how to be cool even when lost. </p><p>   That absence of intelligibility supplied many of us with an ethos: It is OK to see and not comprehend, to gather from context, to laugh when you're not exactly sure what's funny. If you don't get it now, just wait. All things will be clear in the end. Or clear enough. </p><p>   The vast preteen movie market had only just begun to emerge in 1977, the year of \"Star Wars.\" Even many of the movies made for kids in the 1970s were marked by the same raunchy complexity that characterized the work of Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader. \"The Bad News Bears\" lost at the end, as did Rocky (both in 1976). The boxer in the 1979 version of \"The Champ,\" a movie that traumatized me, wins the fight, then dies in the dressing room. </p><p>   Coping with failure by necessity, plumbing the mystery of loss: These are themes my kids have seldom encountered at the movies, because the culture has been directed at them from birth. Between 1970 and 1974, according to IMDB, the top five American movies were \"Love Story,\" \"Diamonds Are Forever,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"The Exorcist\" and \"Blazing Saddles.\" Between 2010 and 2014, the top five American movies were \"Toy Story 3,\" \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" \"The Avengers,\" \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" What's more, the movies that are made for adults have become less complicated -- more like kid movies -- while the kid movies have been stuffed with inside jokes and irony, sops to the grown-ups forced to sit with their charges in the dark. </p><p>   I have a 19-year-old and a 7-year-old, which means that for more than a decade, I've been sitting in the theater thinking: We got screwed. When I was 10, they took me to see \"Annie Hall.\" At 53, I took them to see \"Clifford: The Big Red Dog.\" That is life for those born between 1964 and 1980, caught between huge demographic swells. </p><p>   But here's what I tell myself: We're better off! It is the coming generations, for whom pop art is defined by clarity -- the crooked is made straight, the fog never lingers -- who lose out. Not understanding and finding humility and even pleasure in knowing you don't understand -- that is what we got from growing up in the raucous '70s cineplex dark. If you understand everything, you learn nothing. If you know nothing, and accept it, you are open to everything. Intelligibility is overrated. </p><p></p>",
