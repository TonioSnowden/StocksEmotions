  "title": "She Had a Disney Beginning. At the Olympics, She Wants the Ending. After missing the last Olympics by one spot and the medal stand by one lap, Kristen Santos has one last shot at a U.S. medal in short-track speedskating",
  "text": "<p>\"It was me and a ton of old men,\" Santos says. \"My mom thought I would absolutely hate everything about it.\"</p><p>She loved it. Her favorite thing about figure skating had been zipping around the ice as fast as she could. Her greatest skill in soccer had been sprinting past the other girls and getting to the ball first. Short track split the difference.</p><p>\"I really liked the idea of beating someone to a finish line and having a clear-cut winner,\" she said. \"That was my thing: to beat people to something.\"</p><p>The day nearly two decades ago when she felt an intense desire to beat a bunch of geezers in spandex was the beginning of an unlikely career in short track that has taken Santos halfway around the world in search of a Disney ending.</p><p>Her final shot at a medal here is the 1,500 meters on Wednesday, and Santos is still looking for her version of happily ever after. Her mixed-relay team was bounced on a controversial replay review after it looked as if the Americans had advanced to the finals. Then she was penalized attempting to make a frantic pass in the individual 500 meters. But the cruelest finish came last week in her best race, the 1,000 meters, where she was in position to medal with one lap to go.</p><p>It was at that point, roughly 10 seconds from owning the shiny piece of jewelry she's coveted for a lifetime, when Santos found herself eating ice.</p><p>She was clipped by an Italian rival in a wipeout that sent them sideways and knocked them off the podium, a vivid illustration of the vagaries that define one of the Winter Olympics' wildest sports. If the crash had occurred in the quarterfinals or semifinals, a penalty on the other skater would have resulted in Santos advancing. There are no such rules in finals. It was a spectacularly unlucky break.</p><p>But what looks like a vicious accident to the untrained eye is so common in short track that instead of blaming the skater who took her out, Santos responded to crushing disappointment by graciously calling her \"the nicest person in the world.\"</p><p>\"It's definitely heartbreaking,\" she said. \"But I just kind of have to move forward.\"</p><p>She's used to that by now. In making her Olympic debut at the age of 27, Santos already defied the normal career trajectory of her sport. Apolo Anton Ohno was 19 when he won his first medal in short track. Katherine Reutter was 22 when she became the last U.S. woman to stand alone on the podium. In the world of short track, Santos is one of the old people at Yale.</p><p>\"If you were to ask certain people to go back 10 years,\" said Team USA coach Stephen Gough, \"I don't think they would have predicted this.\"</p><p>But forget about 10 years ago. Santos barging into the medal hunt at the Olympics was equally improbable four years ago.</p><p>Her emergence is one of the few things that has gone right for the U.S. since the electrifying Ohno hung up his skates. The only American in Beijing with a medal is a kid from Pittsburgh who now represents Hungary. One member of the last relay team on the podium immediately quit the sport to play Major League Baseball. \"There's been no lack of dumpster fires in the U.S. federation,\" said Paul Marchese, who builds custom skates for many Olympians, including Santos.</p><p>And yet Santos wasn't on Team USA for the Olympics in 2018. The first reason she didn't make the team is that she wasn't good enough. The second is that she was basically skating with one hand tied behind her back.</p><p>Short track is a sport in which racers chase each other around a circle on ice with butcher's knives on their feet, and every lap reeks of danger when the people involved are standing on 17-inch blades. The unpoliced action of crowded practice sessions can be more perilous than races. It was in a training environment during an event in China almost exactly four years ago when another skater crashed into Santos and sent her careening headfirst toward the padded boards. Her neck hurt so much that she didn't even realize her dangling hand was dripping blood.</p><p>The sliced tendons in her hands and wrist forced Santos home for surgery at the worst possible time: right before U.S. trials. She missed weeks of critical training before taking her shot at the Olympics, but the injury forced her to compete with an unfamiliar piece of equipment.</p><p>\"I had this huge hand claw thing,\" she says of her cast.</p><p>It turns out huge hand claw things are not conducive to skating. She couldn't drag her hand on the ice to pivot around the turn. She couldn't clasp her right hand with her left on the straightaways. \"I had to switch that,\" Santos said. \"It's such a small thing, but it made a big difference.\" She couldn't even get dressed by herself. Before the biggest races of her life, she needed help tying her skate laces.</p><p>Santos missed qualifying by one spot.</p><p>But watching skaters at the Olympics who could have been her if not for a huge hand claw thing was a clarifying experience. It's when Santos realized how badly she yearned to be there.</p><p>\"That was actually the moment when it changed from wanting to be an Olympian to wanting to be an Olympic medalist,\" she says. \"I knew that even if I had made the team, I wasn't going to do a lot. I would've maybe made it out of one round. That's not fun. That's not what I want to go there and do. I want to go there, and I want to win.\"</p><p>Santos knew what she had to do next. For almost her entire career, her coach repeated a message: If you do the training, eventually, nobody will beat you. The problem is that training is brutal.</p><p>\"It's really just torture,\" says Dave Moneypenny, her coach. \"I think it's banned in most countries.\"</p><p>The incremental gains from her grueling dryland workouts soon resulted in exponential improvement. On long, draining laps during practice, when she might have dropped out early because her legs were burning, Santos felt herself powering on. As she tracked her progress in a journal, the handwritten pages told an unmistakable story: In short track, torture worked.</p><p>She came to Beijing as the lone American medal hope among the Dutch, Italians and Koreans who dominate the sport. After missing the Olympics by one spot in 2018 and then finishing one agonizing place off the podium here, Santos gets one last chance on Wednesday in the 1,500, which is oddly fitting for short track's late bloomer: The longest individual race is as much about speed as it is strategy.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily the fastest person who's going to win,\" Moneypenny said. \"It's the person who lays out the race correctly.\"</p><p>Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com</p><p>She Had a Disney Beginning.
