  "text": "<p>Watching the Emmys</p><p>* Emmy Awards 2021: Complete List of Winners</p><p>* 2021 Cheat Sheet: From 'The Crown' to 'Ted Lasso,' What You Need to Know</p><p>* When, How to Watch, and What to Expect</p><p>In the drama categories, Netflix's \"The Crown\" leapt out to an early lead with wins for supporting actress Gillian Anderson, who played Margaret Thatcher; supporting actor Tobias Menzies, who played Prince Philip; and director Jessica Hobbs and writer Peter Morgan.</p><p>HBO, which has taken home the Emmy for best limited series six times in the past 10 years, landed two early wins for \"Mare of Easttown.\" Julianne Nicholson and Evan Peters both won for their supporting roles in the hit crime drama.</p><p>In the first year of eligibility for its original series, streaming service HBO Max got on the board in a major way with \"Hacks.\" The comedy about a Las Vegas comedian and her reluctant millennial protege earned a win for lead actress Jean Smart, who received one of the loudest ovations of the evening. \"Hacks\" also scored for its directing and the writing of series co-creators Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky.</p><p>For the sixth year in a row, \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\" won for best variety talk series. The first person the host thanked was fellow nominee Conan O'Brien, who in June ended his run on late-night TV after 28 years.</p><p>Host Cedric the Entertainer, stand-up comedian and star of CBS sitcom \"The Neighborhood,\" injected some energy into the scaled-down ceremony, leading the celebrity crowd in a singalong of Biz Markie's \"Just a Friend,\" reworked as a tribute to the late rapper and television itself.</p><p>This year's awards will serve as a showcase for the entertainment audiences turned to during the pandemic. Escapist fantasies (\"The Mandalorian,\" \"WandaVision\"), period dramas (\"The Crown,\" \"Bridgerton\") and immersive comedies (\"The Flight Attendant,\" \"Cobra Kai\") are among the series vying for wins in top categories.</p><p>Netflix is expected to have a good night. The streaming service came into Sunday's ceremony with 34 wins already, more than twice the amount received by closest competitors Disney+ (13) and HBO/HBO Max (10). Those preliminary wins, which count toward the Emmy grand totals, were handed out last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, honoring technical categories such as cinematography and casting.</p><p>While Netflix has a good shot at its first-ever win for best drama with \"The Crown,\" a newer streamer, Apple TV+, has designs on outstanding comedy series, thanks to the popularity of \"Ted Lasso.\"</p><p>More than ever, the competition hinges on streaming content. Broadcast and basic cable networks only account for two of the eight series nominated for best drama—\"This Is Us\" (NBC) and \"Pose\" (FX)—and only one best-comedy nominee—\"black-ish\" (ABC).</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>Emmys 2021: 'The Crown', 'Ted Lasso' Score Wins</p>",
