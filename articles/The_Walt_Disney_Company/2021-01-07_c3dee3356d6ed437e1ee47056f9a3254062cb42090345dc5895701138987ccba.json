  "text": "<p>\n  New Release: Discovery+ </p><p>\n  Discovery+, a new subscription streaming service from Discovery, Inc., that launched this week, brings the worlds of Food Network, TLC, HGTV, Animal Planet and other networks and brands, into one universe the way Disney+ consolidated Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel into a single hub at the end of 2019. And much like the way Disney+ has mined franchises like Star Wars for new series like \"The Mandalorian,\" Discovery+ is digging into some of its most bankable franchises for spin offs. TLC's \"90 Day Fiance,\" for example, already has four spin offs, including \"90 Day Bares All,\" \"90 Day Diaries,\" and \"90 Day Journey.\" </p><p>\n  Lisa Holme, a senior vice president at Discovery who leads programming and partnerships for Discovery+, says the service is looking beyond giving its audience more from \"Property Brothers,\" Bobby Flay, \"House Hunters\" and Mike Rowe. It also is offering similar content in familiar genres that wouldn't necessarily air on Discovery's networks, such as the documentary series \"Judi Dench's Wild Borneo Adventure.\" She's also bullish on the service's ability to create the next generation of authorities in the food space, authorities in the home space. \"Can we find and create the next Martha Stewart?\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New Release: 'History of Swear Words' (Netflix) </p><p>\n  \"Words don't start out as swear words,\" Melissa Mohr, author of \"Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing,\" says in an episode of Netflix's \"History of Swear Words.\" \"They're just words.\" </p><p>\n  To unpack how they went bad, the new six-episode, Nicolas Cage-hosted series brings together historians, critics, comics, actors and at least one person who used to write for the dictionary. Familiar talking heads include Sarah Silverman, Nick Offerman and Patti Harrison. </p><p>\n  The collected experts explore issues of race, censorship, tradition, and the elasticity of cultural mores embedded in some of the English language's dirtiest words. Along the way, they celebrate some of the filthy's finest practitioners. In one episode the critic Elvis Mitchell notes that \"s---  is for Isiah Whitlock what f--- is for Samuel L. Jackson.\" </p><p>\n  \"I'm from South Bend, Indiana. My family's from Tennessee,\" says Mr. Whitlock, best known for his creative articulation of the SH word in \"The Wire.\" \"So, we have the south, and we have the Midwest. So, I blend the two to come up with: sheeeeeeeeit.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New Release: 'Cleaning Up' (Sundance Now) </p><p>\n  Mark Marlow stumbled upon the premise of \"Cleaning Up\" when he was watching Charlie Sheen hunting for inside information in 1987's \"Wall Street.\" He noticed a cleaning crew in the background in one scene and thought: \"Well, if they work in the office and they have access to inside information, then why couldn't they just do that?\" </p><p>\n  \"Cleaning Up,\" which premiered on ITV in the U.K. in 2019 is now streaming on Sundance Now. It centers on Sam Cook (Sheridan Smith), a mother of two who has a sharp mind, a gambling problem, and a job cleaning a stock brokerage at night. When she figures out what insider trading is and that a trader at the firm is caught up in it, she wants to get in herself. </p><p>\n  For Mr. Marlow, the show is a marriage of two kinds of gambling, and the way, he thinks, one is seen as pure chance while the other is often viewed as a reliable science. </p><p>\n  \"She doesn't necessarily connect her problems with addiction with the stock market,\" he says. \"She sees it as something as a science, as something she can use to get out of her financial problems. But she can't quite work out that she's replacing one vice for another.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  An Expert Recommends: 'Jojo Rabbit,' 'Bringing Up Baby,' 'His Girl Friday' (HBO Max, The Criterion Channel, Kanopy) </p><p>\n  Director Barry Sonnenfeld's films include \"Men In Black,\" \"Get Shorty\" and a Netflix series, \"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\" He recommends a new film and a pair of classic films. Edited from transcript. </p><p>\n  \"One of my favorite movies that I've seen over the last couple years was 'Jojo Rabbit' (HBO Max), which was written and directed by Taika Waititi and based on the book, 'Caging Skies,' by Christine Leunens. It's about a young German boy who is a member of the Hitler Youth, who learns that his mother is protecting a Jewish girl. It is incredibly moving, real and funny. </p><p>\n  For those that are interested in old black and white comedies, I really like Howard Hawks comedies, like 'Bringing Up Baby' (The Criterion Channel) and 'His Girl Friday' (Kanopy). I love that everyone talks fast. Usually, when my wife and I watch television, she has to hold down my arm to prevent me from waving it at the TV for people to talk faster. That never happens with Hawks. Those screwball comedies are a good introduction to some great old ways of making movies.\" </p><p></p>",
