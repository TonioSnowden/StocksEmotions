  "title": "Netflix Loses Subscribers Amid Growing Competition, Account Sharing; Streaming giant expects to lose two million subscribers in the spring quarter",
  "text": "<p>Netflix blamed password sharing among its members and increasing competition in the streaming space for creating what it called \"revenue growth headwinds.\" Netflix estimated that besides its almost 222 million paying households, the service is being shared with an additional 100 million homes including 30 million alone in the U.S. and Canada alone.</p><p>\"It's harder to grow membership in many marketsâ€”an issue that was obscured by our Covid growth,\" the company said in its letter to investors. Netflix said it is testing password sharing subscription modes that it believes will allow it to monetize sharing and build revenue.</p><p>Besides competition and password sharing, the other reasons Netflix cited as causes for slowing growth include a slower-than-expected adoption of smart TVs, data costs and world events including increasing inflation, the effects of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine and continuing disruption from the pandemic.</p><p>Netflix said shutting down its service in Russia also resulted in the loss of 700,000 subscribers.</p><p>Netflix isn't the only streaming service facing challenges. Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ is adding a lower-priced advertising supported version of the platform later this year in an attempt to boost subscribers.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What happened to your Netflix viewing over the past year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>While Netflix has no plans to launch an advertiser-supported tier, at a recent investment conference its chief operating officer, Spencer Neumann, said, \"never say never.\"</p><p>With growth that has been the envy of the industry for more than a decade, Netflix is seen as a barometer for streaming. That it is now seeing growth slowing, there is concern that the direct-to-consumer streaming business is about to hit some speed bumps.</p><p>Netflix said its plan to right itself will be heavily focused on improving the quality of its programming and the recommendations that platform provides to its customers to keep them engaged in the content and on the service. Netflix already spends more than any other entertainment provider with a programming budget that is expected to surpass more than $20 billion this year.</p><p>The decline brought Netflix's paid global subscriber base to 221.6 million, down from 221.8 million in the prior quarter. Revenue rose roughly 10% to $7.87 billion, below analysts' projections of $7.93 billion. The company's quarterly profit was $1.6 billion, down from $1.71 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Loses Subscribers Amid Growing Competition, Account Sharing</p>",
