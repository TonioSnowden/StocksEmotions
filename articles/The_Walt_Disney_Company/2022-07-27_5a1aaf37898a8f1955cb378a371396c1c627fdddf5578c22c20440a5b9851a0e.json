  "text": "<p>Nexstar turned legacy cable-TV network WGN America into the home of NewsNation in 2020, pitching itself as a just-the-facts alternative to the big cable-news networks. NewsNation reaches 75 million television households across the U.S.</p><p>With less than two years under its belt as a cable news network, NewsNation has greatly expanded past its initial three-hour nightly newscast, with the ultimate goal of becoming a round-the-clock news channel.</p><p>The network's ratings have lagged far behind peers like Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s CNN and Fox Corp.'s Fox News. NewsNation has averaged a prime-time audience of 50,000 people since December, according to Nielsen, compared with 2.37 million for Fox News and 762,000 for CNN. Nexstar CEO Perry Sook said during a call with investors in May that \"ratings continue to grow every month as consumer awareness builds.\"</p><p>Sean Compton, Nexstar's president of networks, said the addition of Mr. Cuomo would further the network's efforts \"to continue to ensure fairness and transparency in our news reporting and talk shows.\"</p><p>Mr. Cuomo's homecoming to a cable-news network comes just as he started a new podcast, \"The Chris Cuomo Project,\" following an unceremonious exit from CNN.</p><p>\"NewsNation believes in the work I am doing with 'The Chris Cuomo Project,' and I look forward to building something special here,\" Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo was fired by CNN in December after an investigation into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct. The former governor has denied touching anyone inappropriately. He resigned nearly a year ago after an investigation by the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James found he sexually harassed multiple women.</p><p>\"I never contacted any media who were covering my brother to try to affect their coverage,\" Mr. Cuomo told Mr. Abrams Tuesday night.</p><p>Chris Cuomo has claimed he was wrongfully terminated and his journalistic reputation smeared, and in March demanded in arbitration at least $125 million in damages from his former employer.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo's former program on CNN, \"Cuomo Prime Time,\" was the network's highest-rated program when he was fired. Before joining CNN in 2013, Mr. Cuomo served as a co-anchor for ABC's prime-time show \"20/20\" and news anchor for \"Good Morning America.\" ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co.</p><p>Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com</p><p>Chris Cuomo Gets New TV-Host Gig With NewsNation</p>",
