  "text": "<p>\n  More travel destinations are requiring travelers to present negative Covid-19 tests for entry, even those who are fully vaccinated. The changes are adding fresh complexity to an already confounding time for travel. </p><p>\n  Travelers are struggling to both keep up with changing test guidelines and find acceptable tests that will provide results by the time they need to fly. </p><p>\n  After the European Union removed the U.S. from its \"safe\" list of countries, some member nations began imposing new rules. Italy, for instance, now requires fully vaccinated travelers to submit a negative test taken within 72 hours of arrival in the country. </p><p>\n  And beginning Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will require fully vaccinated cruise passengers to submit proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within two days of boarding a ship. Previously, fully vaccinated passengers had to provide negative test results within three days of boarding. </p><p>\n  \"Things change daily,\" says Susan Peavey, owner of Susan Peavey Travel Inc. in Marshfield, Mass. Travelers have to understand each country's rules and regulations and in some cases additional requirements at destinations, such as resorts that are now requiring proof of vaccination. </p><p>\n  Finding the correct tests within the allowed time frame is proving challenging for many. In some areas of the country, Covid-19 tests are harder to come by, and acceptable at-home tests can be costly. </p><p>\n  If you've got a trip coming up, here's the latest advice on which tests you'll need -- and how to find them. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Determine which Covid-19 test you need </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Travel advisers say travelers are seeking out at-home tests, but are often unsure which ones are acceptable. The Abbott BinaxNOW Covid-19 Ag Card home test, for example, is a rapid antigen test that is widely accepted by many cruise lines and airlines because it includes the supervision of a telemedicine professional. The professional will watch you take the Covid-19 test, and you will receive a validated result through an app. The tests can cost $150 for a pack of six. </p><p>\n  The type of test you can take also depends on your vaccination status. Many cruise lines will accept antigen tests for fully vaccinated travelers, but unvaccinated travelers, including children under 12, must submit PCR tests. Nucleic acid amplification tests, which include PCR tests, are also widely accepted and available at pharmacies such as CVS or Walgreens. </p><p>\n  Robin Katz, a travel adviser who owns a Cruise Planners franchise in Miami, says she recommends travelers take both a PCR test and a rapid antigen test if time allows. PCR tests are widely accepted, she says, but the results can take longer to arrive, so having a rapid antigen test can also be helpful in time-sensitive situations, she says. </p><p>\n  Some countries, such as Canada and Anguilla, don't accept antigen tests. Travelers will need to look closely at each country's specific requirements. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Give yourself plenty of time to get a test </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Randy Mewes, a mechanic for a John Deere dealership, lives in rural Nebraska. He knew he needed to get a Covid-19 test before departing on a Carnival cruise to Alaska last month, but the chain pharmacies nearest to him were in Lincoln, about an hour away. He hoped to find a more convenient option, while making sure he got his results in time. </p><p>\n  Mr. Mewes, who is fully vaccinated, went to a nearby retirement home in Adams, Neb., where he knew staff members were tested weekly. He was able to get a rapid antigen test and get his negative results the day before he boarded the cruise. </p><p>\n  Travel agents suggest doing a broad search for testing locations if local pharmacies are booked up. Ms. Katz notes that Zoo Miami, for example, offers PCR tests. </p><p>\n  Because of the tightened timing for tests, some cruise lines are offering passengers options. Royal Caribbean International sells at-home test kits that can be ordered online. They cost $69.99 for a pack of two and $99.99 for a pack of three. </p><p>\n  Disney Cruise Line will require all passengers to take a rapid PCR test at the terminal before boarding starting Monday, regardless of vaccination status. The test is provided free of charge, the cruise line said. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Print out test results </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Many airlines will allow you to upload vaccination records and negative test results to an app. Having a hard copy on hand can help, too. Ms. Katz says she cautions clients against relying only on digital copies in case they lose Internet access or cell service when their results are being checked. </p><p>\n  When Mr. Mewes was waiting to board the cruise in Seattle, he realized the paper that showed his negative test result was in his luggage, which had been taken away to be loaded onto the ship. He chased down the luggage cart, and got the result back in time. \"Keep everything together, and it'll save you a lot of heartache,\" he says. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Get tested -- even if you don't have to </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Not every international destination requires a negative test for entry, but many travel advisers say they tell their clients to take a test regardless. </p><p>\n  \"If you can do it [easily], why not,\" says Jerry Lang, president of House of Travel, which is based in Aventura, Fla. \"The rule might change when you're flying.\" </p><p></p>",
