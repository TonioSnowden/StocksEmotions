  "text": "<p>Do not check your email. <em>Annette</em> — the singular new musical from the one-off Leos Carax — comes with a preface to its preface, a voice in the dark demanding your full attention. Seconds later, the overture is under way. Stars Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver, neither apparently yet in character, stride down Santa Monica Boulevard alongside the composers, Los Angeles art-poppers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c60f9e6f-35af-4a43-83f4-28b2662626ab\">Sparks</a>. Together they sing about the budget. A further note to the audience too. “Exits are clearly marked/Thought you should know.” First a grab by the throat, then a get-out clause. Carax is nothing if not a risk-taker with a conscience.</p> <p>In the grandly batty French cinema of his career to date, Carax has had Juliette Binoche water-ski down the Seine (<em>Les Amants Du Pont Neuf</em>) and Denis Lavant eat flowers in Père Lachaise cemetery (<em>Holy Motors</em>). But he has never made — until now — a musical. Paris has been swapped out for LA, too. Still, old habits die hard. For the director, amour fou has always been a speciality. Here once more, boy meets girl, explosively. She is Ann, a publicly beloved soprano, played by Cotillard with (at times) a <em>Breathless</em> pixie cut. He is Henry (Driver), an American comic of the school of shock and awe. Onstage she is buried in bouquets. He turns stomachs just clearing his throat.</p> <p>Before you can say <em>La Belle et la Bête</em>, the movie gets there first, the showbiz media tickled like everyone else by the coupling. “Beauty and the bastard” reads the headline. Luxe visuals seduce. (Prepare for storm-crazed seas, world tours, sex and levitation.) The general mood of outré mischief adds up to a movie that can't quite believe it is getting to exist. “We're scoffing at logic,” Driver and Cotillard trill. But the more of <em>Annette</em> that passes, the less it feels like a giddy riff on the Hollywood musical. In fact, it feels like an older form of story and song altogether — its giant turns of fate plain operatic. Carax makes the lineage clear in montage, Ann consumptive in <em>La bohème</em>, tormented in <em>Madame Butterfly</em>, her role in life to play tragic women.</p> <p>Which is exactly how Henry sees her — and much of <em>Annette</em> is the world as Henry sees it. Such is the movie's lopsidedness. Structural flaw or sly mirroring of how some men always hog the drama? (A best guess? Both.) Either way, Henry sprawls all over the film, Driver looming like a steroidal forest sprite. Sometimes movies use the actor's height and sombre bearing as signposts of inner decency. More often he plays villainous menace — see the last three <em>Star Wars</em> films — or characters at least capable of the deeply swinish. It wouldn't do to say where Henry lies on the spectrum. But the film comes to share his glower of self-loathing.</p> <p>Even what seem like gags turn grave — Annette, a daughter, born to the couple, played by a puppet. On paper, ridiculous. On screen, the mad gamble pays off. <em>Pinocchio</em> always said a lot about parents and children — and that love becomes the heart of the film, persuasively. It gives us a killer final scene, but by then the movie's bet on itself is already won. Carax is incapable of cliché and since when was flawless interesting anyway? In an age where blockbusters are watched between scrolling, there is something oddly heroic about a film this filled with urgent, handmade flights of imagination. More important yet, the puppet answers back. The days when Henrys everywhere had the stage to themselves are over, <em>Annette</em> suggests. Carax is paying attention to the world, it seems. He only asks that it does the same in return.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>In UK cinemas from September 3; in US cinemas now</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Annette is filled with urgent flights of imagination' FT.com 1 September.
