  "title": "Cineworld Chief on Meme Stocks, Competing With AMC and the Cinema Industry's Pandemic Recovery; Cineworld, the owner of Regal Cinemas, expects to recover to its pre-pandemic level of earnings and activity as soon as the fourth quarter, says CEO Mooky Greidinger",
  "text": "<p>Cineworld Group Chief Executive Mooky Greidinger can be described as the mirror image of Adam Aron, his meme-loving counterpart at rival AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.</p><p>As top executive at the world's second-largest cinema chain behind AMC, Mr. Greidinger, 68, is soft-spoken and isn't known as a showman. He doesn't have a social-media presence and has no nationwide fan base of investors like Mr. Aron does. Mr. Greidinger has lived in Haifa, a seaside city in Israel, for his entire life.</p><p>While Mr. Aron entered the movie theater business late in his career after stints running an NBA team, a ski resort and a cruise line, Mr. Greidinger has been in the business since he was a kid, starting as an usher at one of his father's cinemas when he was still in school.</p><p>But his company, which owns Regal Cinemas, isn't far behind AMC in the number of theaters and screens that it operates. The two companies face similar challenges trying to recover from pandemic lockdowns and get moviegoers back into theaters, while working out deals with Hollywood studios for exclusive theatrical windows to show films before they are released to streaming.</p><p>As with AMC, Cineworld has suffered extraordinary losses and financial setbacks because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, the company warned of \"material uncertainty\" about its business after posting a $3 billion loss for 2020.</p><p>In an interview at a Regal Cinema in Union Square, New York, Mr. Greidinger spoke about the industry's challenges and opportunities, including meme stocks, digital piracy, cryptocurrencies and his company's financial health. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>WSJ: Cineworld isn't a meme stock like AMC. Do you wish that had happened to you?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I think what happened to them is a very good thing for AMC. And you know, we are traded in the U.K. market. Not every stock in the U.S. market is a meme stock. And I think that AMC did well with it. They handled the situation in a good way. And I think that investors will see the conduct of the industry and will see the way we are performing, and we will see this in our share price. Are we going to become a meme stock? I don't think so.</p><p>There are pluses and minuses in every thing in life. I will not give you a straight answer. Of course I would love my shares to be much higher than they are today. But you know, in everything like this there is also an element of risk.</p><p>I am happy for AMC that they are doing well. At the end of the day, with all of the competition in the industry, I don't think that any industry wants to see one of the huge players of the industry falling down. This isn't positive news for anyone.</p><p>WSJ: AMC has discussed letting customers pay with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or dogecoin. Have you considered this too?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I think currently if everyone pays us in American dollars, we are happy. But if people insist, we'll consider.</p><p>WSJ: Are you friends with Adam Aron?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I have a very good relationship with Adam.</p><p>You know there are so many issues that we are not allowed to talk about, because we are really the two big competitors. But personally, I get along very well with Adam, I like his sense of humor, I like his personality. You know, not every competition needs to be a fight between the CEOs.</p><p>We get along on a personal level good. But go out to the field and show me a good location and I will fight Adam to the last minute to get it. That is my job.</p><p>WSJ: Would you say that it is one of your goals to one day operate more cinemas than AMC does and become the market leader?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I don't think it really matters if you are the biggest or the second largest. Our main target is to give the right experience to our customers and to be profitable and attractive to our shareholders. It's not the football season that you need to win the final [laughs].</p><p>WSJ: When do you anticipate Cineworld returning to its pre-pandemic level of earnings and activity?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I would say that if Covid stays where it is now, the level of vaccinations continues and there are no new big surprises, I think that we will start to get back to our 2019 numbers in the fourth quarter of 2021. And looking at the lineup of 2022, we have a good chance of getting to a level that will be similar to 2019 numbers.</p><p>WSJ: How concerned are you about whether you can rely on the major Hollywood studios to give you the exclusive windows that you need?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: All of the studios, and for sure all the exhibitors, understand two major points. First, there is a need for a theatrical exclusivity window to maximize the income of the movie. Second, the length of the window should be somehow based on the size of the movie. Smaller movies might have shorter windows, a bigger movie needs a bigger window.</p><p>The last thing that we all learned that when there is a release of day-and-date [simultaneous release to both theaters and streaming], there is the impact of piracy. Because, if you release a film to theaters the same day as streaming, on the first day it creates very high-quality pirated copies.</p><p>The impact of this is very significant. Because you will always find some low-quality pirated copies after a movie opens. Somebody does it with their phone, another does it with a small camera. But once you go day-and-date, it creates first-class copies. And the damage of these copies is huge.</p><p>WSJ: Can you quantify the damage of the high-quality pirated copies that stem from day-and-date release?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: It is very speculative, because you never know how the movie would have done. But you can extract some numbers, you can do some estimation. There is no argument that the window is important for both sides. If you look at the results of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, it opened to be the best Labor Day release in history. It's a huge achievement for Disney.</p><p>WSJ: So you think that in 2022 you may meet or surpass the $1.6 billion of adjusted Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] you generated in 2019?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I think we have a relatively good chance to be somewhere around there. Some of this maybe will not be done by similar revenues, but we also had big improvement on the cost side.</p><p>On the other hand, you say how does it go, subject to Covid staying at this level. And if you look at the lineup of 2022 movies, it is a very strong lineup. And if it will not reach 2019 levels, it will be relatively close.</p><p>WSJ: You recently obtained some new loans from your existing lenders. Will that satisfy your liquidity needs through the recovery? Or will you need to pursue additional financing over the next six months?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: I think we are now in a good position, if there will not be any later crisis and if the numbers play in the way we anticipate for the fourth quarter and 2022, not even at the levels we are expecting, it doesn't have to go back to the numbers of 2019. Even if it goes to 75% of this, we will be OK. We will not need anymore financing.</p><p>WSJ: If things go well, would you consider being in the market for acquisitions?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: We are not shopping now, but we are analyzing here or there, offers. We are analyzing cinemas that came to the market for various reasons.</p><p>WSJ: Are you currently in discussions with any of the major Hollywood studios about the theatrical windows for 2022? For the rest of 2022, what kind of windows have you agreed upon?</p><p>Mr. Greidinger: We currently have either agreement or policy formed for 2022 that we will continue to work with theatrical exclusivity, at least for the big movies.</p><p>it is not sealed yet. With some of the studios, this is already the agreement. With some, it is being considered. But with most of the big movies, it will be around 45 days.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p><p>Cineworld Chief on Meme Stocks, Competing With AMC and the Cinema Industry's Pandemic Recovery</p>",
