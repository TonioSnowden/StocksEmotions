  "text": "<p>   The Duke and Duchess hit the market during a rush that turned into streaming-service FOMO -- fear of missing out on the producer who would deliver a breakthrough hit. For streamers competing against one another, getting J.J. Abrams, the Obamas or any other notable name signed was as much about bringing them in-house as it was keeping them out-of-house elsewhere. </p><p>   Though they had scant producing experience, Prince Harry and Meghan had a few advantages. They are globally recognized names at a time when streaming services are competing for viewers around the world. They are a young family at a time when most megadeal signers are midcareer professionals, making them a potential draw for younger audiences absorbed in TikTok and other services. </p><p>   The couple's lawyers set up meetings with companies only after conveying the range of investment they were looking for, hoping to avoid putting the couple through talks that were just about meeting the famous pair. Disney, Netflix, Apple and NBCUniversal were among those who met with the couple or their team. </p><p>   Netflix won, signing their Archewell Productions, a division of their company formed last year and named for the Greek word \"arche,\" which means \"source of action\" and served as inspiration for their son Archie's name. </p><p>   \"Through its creative partnership with Netflix, Archewell Productions will utilize the power of storytelling to embrace our shared humanity and duty to truth through a compassionate lens,\" the company said when the deal was announced. </p><p>   Netflix wasn't the highest bidder, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the couple was drawn to the service's global footprint, its focus on children's programming and the menu of other shows it could carry, from documentaries to scripted series. </p><p>   The deal came just as skepticism across the industry was growing over such arrangements. Studios fell over themselves to woo creators like Mr. Abrams in deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but only a few such arrangements have yielded commensurate hits. And even as Netflix talent deals produce home runs like Shonda Rhimes's \"Bridgerton,\" many of the service's breakout shows have also come from relatively unknown creators, with programming like \"The Tiger King\" and \"The Queen's Gambit.\" </p><p>   Archewell is also competing for growing interest in royal-family programming. Netflix's fourth season of \"The Crown,\" about the life of Prince Harry's grandmother, won outstanding drama series at the Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday. Actress Kristen Stewart is generating awards buzz for her turn as his mother in the coming movie \"Spencer.\" Princess Diana is even getting the musical treatment in a show called \"Diana,\" slated to open on Broadway in November. </p><p>   Prince Harry and Meghan have spent the past several months hiring executives like podcast veteran Rebecca Sananes as head of audio, joining a handful of employees. </p><p>   She reports to Ben Browning, Archewell's head of content, who was hired in March. Mr. Browning earned acclaim most recently for co-producing \"Promising Young Woman,\" a revenge fantasy about surviving sexual assault that was nominated for best picture this year at the Academy Awards. </p><p>   Now Mr. Browning is heading a company that will, in its words, \"share impactful content that unlocks action.\" </p><p>   So far, that has meant safe, feel-good programming. </p><p>   Archewell isn't going to produce the next \"Chucky,\" as one business associate described it, but the team is trying to avoid programming that seems overly earnest. </p><p>   Any production will have a hard time outshining the books and interviews that have broken the seal of custom and reserve that define the royals. In \"The Me You Can't See,\" Prince Harry spoke of recalling the sound of horse hooves from his mother's funeral. He talked of Meghan crying at night because of the cruelty of the London tabloids, and how his son said \"Grandma Diana\" from an early age. And most notably, in a separate interview with Ms. Winfrey, the couple shared the bombshell that an unidentified member of the royal family openly speculated to Harry on the skin tone of their child. </p><p>   It's undeniably good TV, but it also means the Sussexes bring a unique set of baggage to a working relationship. While producing \"The Me You Can't See,\" Mr. Kamen was approached by the producers of the Broadway musical \"Diana.\" It was being filmed for release on Netflix -- the kind of adaptation Mr. Kamen's company had done to great acclaim with the blockbuster musical \"Hamilton.\" He passed on the opportunity, worried that Prince Harry would be angry with him if he got involved with a show about his mother. </p><p>   Mr. Kamen never mentioned to Prince Harry how he had passed on the project, but now he doesn't know if the prince would have cared. After all, the prince and his wife soon signed their own deal with Netflix. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Max Colchester contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
