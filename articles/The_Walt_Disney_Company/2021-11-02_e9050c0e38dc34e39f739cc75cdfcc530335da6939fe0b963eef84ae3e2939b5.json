  "title": "U.S. News: U.S. Advances Private-Sector Vaccine Mandates",
  "text": "<p>Both mandates have drawn opposition from states led by Republican governors. Missouri and nine other GOP-led states sued the Biden administration last week to stop the contractor mandate. Arizona in September sued to stop the broader private-sector mandate, and other GOP-led states are taking steps in opposition.</p><p>The Office of Management and Budget on Monday completed its review of the regulation requiring workers at private-sector businesses with at least 100 employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be regularly tested.</p><p>That review set the mandate up to be published on the Federal Register \"in the coming days,\" a U.S. Labor Department spokesperson said. The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been developing the vaccine mandate under a federal rule-making called an emergency temporary standard.</p><p>Employers who fall under the regulation must \"develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory Covid-19 vaccination policy, unless they adopt a policy requiring employees to choose either to get vaccinated or to undergo regular Covid-19 testing and wear a face covering at work,\" the Labor Department spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>Many businesses also are awaiting details on the federal mandate before implementing their own vaccination rules. Some have questions about how they will need to document employees' vaccination status. Others -- including Walt Disney Co. and meatpacker Tyson Foods Inc. -- have pushed ahead with their own requirements.</p><p>The Biden administration has discussed the pending vaccine mandate with many trade groups in recent weeks, including the Associated Builders and Contractors.</p><p>Employers in the construction industry have been concerned about the mandate potentially driving workers who don't want to comply toward smaller companies that won't be affected by the rule, said Greg Sizemore, vice president of health, safety, environment and workforce development at the Associated Builders and Contractors.</p><p>\"We are dealing with a very significant workforce shortage in the construction industry,\" Mr. Sizemore said. The mandate is \"going to really influence and exacerbate that problem.\"</p><p>The OSHA rules also would require employers to provide paid time off to workers so they can receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Employers that don't comply can face fines of up to roughly $13,600 a violation, the administration has said.</p><p>It isn't yet clear exactly how OSHA's vaccine mandate will be enforced. The agency's inspector count has dwindled in recent years.</p><p>The requirement could mandate that employees who aren't vaccinated pay for their own Covid-19 tests, which could be a point of contention for labor groups. Some businesses have already been covering the costs of testing for workers.</p><p>The federal government's pending private-sector mandate is one of several components of a plan Mr. Biden announced in early September during a surge in Covid-19 cases tied to the highly contagious Delta variant. Covid-19 cases have eased in recent weeks.</p><p>Nearly 80% of the U.S. adult population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 70% of adults are fully vaccinated.</p><p>---</p><p>Amara Omeokwe contributed to this article.</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: This Is Your Pilot Speaking\" -- WSJ Nov. 8, 2021)</p>",
