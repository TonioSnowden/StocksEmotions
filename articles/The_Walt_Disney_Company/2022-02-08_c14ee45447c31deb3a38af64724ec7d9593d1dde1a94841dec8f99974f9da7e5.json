  "title": "'Fight Club' Ends With a Bang Again --- China's Tencent streaming platform quietly restores 1999 cult film's conclusion",
  "text": "<p>Gone is a note at the end that says police prevented the explosions and sent Mr. Norton's character to an asylum.</p><p>The change, which users first noticed late last week, comes after Tencent sparked global ridicule by uploading the censored version of \"Fight Club\" to its streaming platform in January. Tencent didn't explain the new ending at the time, nor has it said why it restored the original one. The company declined to comment.</p><p>Censorship has grown stricter -- but more opaque and less predictable -- under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. For many among the country's cinephiles, Tencent's response to the furor over \"Fight Club\" only muddies the waters more.</p><p>\"You never know where the red line lies,\" wrote one user of the popular Twitter-like Weibo platform after the film's original ending was restored.</p><p>For decades, Chinese censors demanded that scenes deemed sensitive or vulgar be cut from officially imported foreign films and TV shows. In one famous example, 2007's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" appeared in mainland theaters missing roughly half of the scenes involving a villain played by Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat after censors decided they made Chinese people look bad.</p><p>Chinese authorities have, on rare occasions, required elements to be added to films as a means of censorship. Such was the case with the 2018 romantic fantasy \"The Shape of Water,\" in which a dark swimsuit was added to cover the naked body of the protagonist in a shower scene with her amphibian lover.</p><p>But it is unusual for films to be augmented in a way that completely alters their endings. And in the case of \"Fight Club,\" a movie considered part of the antiestablishment canon that had long been widely available to Chinese viewers through black market DVDs, the inserting of a pro-establishment conclusion sparked mockery in and out of the country.</p><p>On Zhihu, a Quora-like site, users responded by suggesting mock endings for other films. One user imagined a new ending for \"Shawshank Redemption\" in which Andy Dufresne, the wrongfully convicted main character, is rearrested by police and sentenced to additional prison time because \"the right thing cannot be done in the wrong way.\"</p><p>In a recent episode, CBS's \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" responded to the \"Fight Club\" alteration with its own set of new endings, including a version of 1977's original \"Star Wars\" film in which the evil Empire rebuilds the Death Star and imprisons the rebels.</p><p>Chinese regulations on censorship require that films avoid \"confusing justice with injustice\" and ban plots that \"tout arrogance for criminals.\" To ensure access to mainland China's lucrative market, filmmakers in Hong Kong have long been known to make two versions of crime movies, one for mainland audiences that ends in victory for the police and another with the opposite result for the rest of the world.</p><p>China's regulators in charge of film and the internet didn't respond to requests for comment. It couldn't be determined who was responsible for the altered \"Fight Club\" ending.</p><p>Chuck Palahniuk, the writer whose novel inspired the \"Fight Club\" film, responded to news of the altered ending with a post on Twitter late last month: \"This is SUPER wonderful! Everyone gets a happy ending in China!\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
