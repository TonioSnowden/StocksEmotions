  "title": "Technology:  A&E Suit Accuses Reelz of Ripping Off Canceled Show 'Live PD'  ----  By Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>   The parent of A&amp;E Network has filed a lawsuit against rival cable network Reelz and the producers behind \"On Patrol: Live,\" saying the program is nothing more than an unauthorized remake of its canceled show \"Live PD.\" </p><p>   The suit, which alleges theft of intellectual property, was filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York. A&amp;E parent A&amp;E Television Networks said production company Big Fish Entertainment \"created a clone of 'Live PD' featuring the same primary hosts, content, format, segments, and more\" and that Reelz aired the show over \"repeated and vociferous objections\" from A&amp;E. </p><p>   A&amp;E, which owns \"Live PD,\" discontinued the show in 2020 even though it was averaging close to two million viewers per episode, according to Nielsen. Reelz premiered \"On Patrol: Live\" last month. While Reelz isn't available in as many households as A&amp;E, \"On Patrol: Live\" is averaging more than 1.1 million viewers per episode. </p><p>   A Reelz representative said the network hadn't been served with the suit or reviewed the complaint in detail and \"thus has no comment at this time beyond denying liability and expressing its ongoing commitment to 'On Patrol: Live.'\" Reelz is part of Hubbard Media Group, a closely held broadcaster based in St. Paul, Minn. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for Big Fish didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   \"Live PD\" was a reality show that followed police officers on the job in different cities. It was a hit show for A&amp;E from its launch in 2016 to its cancellation in May 2020. The show was pulled following the killing of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and the nationwide protests against police brutality that followed. </p><p>   At that time, A&amp;E said in a statement, \"This is a critical time in our nation's history and we have made the decision to cease production on 'Live PD.'\" The statement added that \"we will determine if there is a clear pathway to tell the stories of both the community and the police officers whose role it is to serve them.\" </p><p>   In June of this year, Reelz and \"Live PD\" host and executive producer Dan Abrams struck a deal to create \"On Patrol: Live,\" a new version of the show. At that time, Mr. Abrams told The Wall Street Journal that he had been working for some time to find a new partner for the program, which he felt should have never been canceled by A&amp;E. </p><p>   \"At a time when people have a lot of questions about law enforcement, it allows the audience to see in real time what police officers do and how they do it, including the nuances and the uncertainty about what happens next,\" he said. Mr. Abrams didn't respond to a request for comment about the suit. </p><p>   Although the shows have different names, A&amp;E's suit said Reelz and the producers, in promoting the debut of \"On Patrol: Live,\" \"coordinated a multimedia blitz proclaiming 'the return,' 'relaunch,' and 'revival' of 'Live PD.' \" A Journal article with the headline \"Live PD' Is Coming Back on TV This Summer as 'On Patrol: Live'\" is cited in the suit. </p><p>   A&amp;E said it was seeking \"all profits defendants realized as a result of defendants' unlawful acts complained of herein\" as well as punitive and compensatory damages. </p><p>   A&amp;E Networks is co-owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp. </p><p></p>",
