  "text": "<p>We are grandparents who will now not be funding a trip to Disney World for our grandson. It's past time for the tiny tail to stop wagging the big dog. We are ashamed to be stockholders. Disney needs new management and to get back to its own business of running the corporation.</p><p>Terry and Diann Dempsey</p><p>Grayson, Ga.</p><p>Long before Walt Disney Co. came out as a supporter of sexual-orientation liberation, it was working aggressively behind the scenes to force change. In the 1990s, I was one of several hundred U.S. partners in one of the largest employee-benefits consulting firms, and we all received an email about a change in our benefits policy. We would start offering health insurance to same-sex partners of unmarried employees. We thought the email had a misprint because opposite-sex partners weren't entitled to the new benefit. It wasn't a misprint—the logic was that employees with opposite-sex partners could marry, but same-sex partners couldn't.</p><p>A furious exchange of emails followed. Some partners were upset by the potentially high cost and some by the same-sex exclusivity. Finally, our managing partner weighed in with an email that threatened on-the-spot firing of the next partner who sent an email objecting to the policy. This was unprecedented.</p><p>We found out that Disney, one of the firm's largest clients, insisted that its benefits consulting firm be a leader in offering same-sex benefits. We adopted their desired policy ourselves before rolling it out to hundreds of other clients. Disney was woke more than two decades ago, before it was fashionable. God knows how woke we'll be in another two decades.</p><p>P.D. Grant</p><p>Palm Coast, Fla.</p><p>One of the ironies of Disney's decision to speak out against Florida's Parental Rights in Education Bill is that Disneyland has always been a place adults and kids enjoy as an escape from the pressures of everyday life. But Disneyland is mostly about the joys of childhood experience, of which sexual innocence plays a vital and healthy part. In supporting extremists in their quest to instruct children as young as 5 on sexual-related matters, Disney is opening a new ride in its amusement park. One full of darkness and dangerous turns.</p><p>Phillip Ruland</p><p>Newport Beach, Calif.</p><p>Has Disney Crossed a Line With Customers?</p>",
