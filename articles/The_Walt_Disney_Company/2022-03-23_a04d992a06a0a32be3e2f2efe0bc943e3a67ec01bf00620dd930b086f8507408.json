  "title": "Business News: Disney Staff Protest LGBT Stand",
  "text": "<p>The Parental Rights in Education bill, passed March 8 by the Florida Senate, prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation for children in the third grade or lower and limits such instruction for older students.</p><p>The issue has emerged as a challenge for Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek as he enters the third and final year of his contract. Employees, fans, shareholders and elected officials from both sides of the political spectrum have slammed Disney first for failing to take a public stance on the bill, then for opposing it only after it had passed and while the company was under heavy public pressure to do so.</p><p>Disney sought to head off the protests at a virtual town-hall meeting held Monday, where Mr. Chapek assured employees that the company would use its experience with the Florida bill \"as a catalyst for more meaningful and lasting change.\" The company would oppose a recent Texas executive order cracking down on parents who provide gender-transitioning medical care for young children and form a companywide task force to develop ways to be a positive force in the LGBT community, Mr. Chapek said.</p><p>Earlier, Mr. Chapek had apologized for letting his employees down by not taking a public stance before the bill passed and said the company would pause political giving in Florida and do more to advocate against bills across the nation that it views as harmful to the LGBT community. But some employees still feel the company isn't doing enough.</p><p>\"The response internally at the highest levels of the company was not appropriate and completely shortsighted, as well as tone deaf,\" said Kate Bustamante, senior manager of original documentaries at Disney's Hulu streaming service. \"I think we need to speak up against those things, because if Disney wants to continue to be a relevant media company, then they need to get with the program.\"</p><p>Ms. Bustamante was among about 50 Disney employees who gathered Tuesday at Bette Davis Picnic Area in Griffith Park in Glendale, Calif., a short drive from both Disney's animation studios and its Burbank headquarters.</p><p>Some carried signs calling on the company to do more to oppose the Florida bill. Several workers who walked off the job said while they have received support from co-workers at the division and team level, they felt corporate leadership has failed them.</p><p>A Disney spokesman said Tuesday that the company had sought to address some of these concerns in Monday's internal meeting. \"We know how important this issue is for our LGBTQ+ employees, their families and allies, we respect our colleagues' right to express their views,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>Several protesters called on Disney to indefinitely stop, not temporarily pause, political contributions to elected officials involved in the Florida legislation.</p><p>They also called on the company not to require employees to move. Mr. Chapek was criticized last year for ordering thousands of employees, including the elite group of theme-park engineers known as Imagineers, to relocate from Southern California to Florida to save the company money.</p><p>\"People shouldn't be forced to live in a place that they're fearful of,\" said Shannon Cheung, who does shipping and logistics for TV shows at ABC Signature, a Disney-owned studio.</p><p>---</p><p>Patience Haggin and Anne Steele contributed to this article.</p>",
