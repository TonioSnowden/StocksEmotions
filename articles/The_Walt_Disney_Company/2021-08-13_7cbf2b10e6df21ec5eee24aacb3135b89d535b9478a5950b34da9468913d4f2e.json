  "text": "<p>“Good fences make good neighbours” is an American homily used to justify everything from white picket to gated communities. In delineating property, decorum is maintained. But what if you have bad neighbours? That familiar line became popular after the 1914 Robert Frost poem “Mending Wall”, in reality an ironic dismissal of the need for ostentatious walls. He wants to know “what I was walling in or walling out”.</p> <p>There is a section of architecture that is not built to accommodate or give pleasure, but out of sheer spite. Huge blank walls, grotesque fences, light-blocking structures, even skyscrapers conceived solely to spoil a neighbour's view. Used to oppress, obstruct, annoy, alienate and frustrate, spite architecture throws up the irresistible stories of humanity's capacity for bad neighbourliness, making it a clickbait favourite.</p> <p>Many of even the most extreme examples have become part of the landscape and barely raise an eyebrow. In Nightingale Lane, in Clapham, London, for instance, there is a strange, chunky brick wall standing hard up against an elegant Victorian semi. It was built by the owner of the grand, Italianate house next door to prevent overlooking. </p> <p>A little ironic — their own ostentatious tower allowed them to overlook everyone else's properties. Now covered in ivy, a photo from the 1970s shows it as a “folly wall”: masquerading as a historic remnant of an earlier building, complete with three storeys of arcades.</p> <p>Despite this being my local piece of spite architecture, I had not been aware of it until the story appeared on Twitter, posted by comedy writer Jason Hazeley (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonHazeley/status/1393210338728976388\">@jasonhazeley</a>), in a thread that went (south London) viral.</p> <p>People love gossip and feuds, but they fade. But the walls survive to inscribe that spite in the landscape as scar tissue.</p> <p>Bolder still is the Jealous Wall, a neo-Gothic folly built to resemble the ruins of an abbey in Mullingar, County Westmeath, in Ireland. It was erected by Robert Rochfort in about 1760 to shield his view of his brother George's newly built Tudenham Park House, a newer and more elegant building than his own Belvedere House. </p> <p>But it also acted as a visual metaphor for his raging jealousy. Robert suspected his wife, Mary Molesworth, of having had an affair with another brother and had her confined in their old home for more than 30 years. At this time the first Gothic Revival house had only just been built (Strawberry Hill in Twickenham) but this wall and the lives around it were, arguably, its most haunting monument, retelling as gothic a story as you could imagine.</p> <p>A wall is the fundamental unit of architecture, one that can be extruded into a house. What have become known as “spite houses” are often slender trips of architecture designed to block a view, deny light or stymie a development.</p> <p>The Grudge in Beirut is one of the greats. Another result of brotherly (lack of) love, it is the result of a dispute over how to divide an inherited plot. Receiving only a thin leftover plot, one brother built a block, barely thicker than a wall in places, to deliberately obstruct his brother's sea view. Built in 1954, it's an elegant, if slender, strip of Modernism, looking more like a stage flat than an apartment building. </p> <p>Though now in disrepair, it was inhabited. Ironically, its sea-view location now makes it, by square foot, one of Beirut's most valuable properties.</p> <p>Another skinny strip is the O'Reilly Spite House in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When Francis O'Reilly failed to sell an 8ft-wide plot of land to a neighbour for a profit, he built it into an attenuated, clapboarded house. Despite having almost no interior it is, in a neat twist of fate, today an interiors store.</p> <p>Just over the river in Boston, the clapboarded Skinny House sits squeezed between two later brick-built apartment blocks. The legend is that two brothers inherited a plot and, while one was away fighting in the civil war, the other appropriated the larger part to build a big house. Enraged on his return, the exploited sibling built the thin house to block his brother's view of the water and the docks. Through a quirk of history, the spite house survived the neighbour it was built to insult.</p> <p>Another such is the Plum Island Pink House in Newbury, Massachusetts. An isolated building — now abandoned and with a haunting, Hopper-ish atmosphere — the house was, according to local myth, the result of a divorce settlement in which the wife demanded her husband build an exact replica of their marital home. He did, but in the middle of a desolate salt marsh where the taps only flowed with saltwater.</p> <p>It's a truism that hate often outlives love, as those cultures with long traditions of vendettas know too well. The Inat Kuća in Sarajevo translates as the “house of spite”. It should, perhaps, have been called the “cunning house” but it is another remarkable survivor. </p> <p>When the Austro-Hungarian empire began its occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, it attempted to make its mark through a series of grand, new public buildings. A site near the river Miljacka was earmarked for a new city hall and the plots were assembled. Except for one. </p> <p>A wily old Bosnian named Benderija refused to sell his Ottoman-era wooden house. After multiple offers he finally agreed to sell for a sack full of golden ducats (doesn't that sound good?) and an agreement to dismantle his house and rebuild it on the opposite side of the river, overlooking the city hall, an odd Orientalist confection that now contains a museum. The house, much altered, survives and is now occupied by a Bosnian restaurant, Inat Kuća.</p> <p>The Sarajevo house intersects with another type of spite house: the holdout or nail house. Edith Macefield's 1900 farmhouse in Seattle became a symbol of resistance to corporate power when she refused to sell to a developer who then built around it, isolating it in a bizarre concrete well. </p> <p>It became associated with the Disney film <em>Up</em> and was later decorated with balloons in a horrible marketing coup the year after Macefield died in 2008. Empty, it looks a little forlorn now, but it is still there.</p> <p>It was China's construction boom and voracious appetite for land that produced the most memorable holdouts, with a striking example in Wenling, Zhejiang province, sat torn from its neighbours in the middle of a highway. Dozens of these houses, some poking up in the middle of vast constructions sites, others sitting amid ranks of towers, became social media sensations, cheesy metaphors for the human spirit. Most have since been hammered down.</p> <p>But those survivors are something else: stories of stubbornness and resistance rather than hate. The best of the spite houses combine pride, envy and outrage, and the results are often surprisingly inventive. And big. At 253ft, the Wainhouse Tower in Calderdale, West Yorkshire (built 1871-75) is billed as the tallest folly in the world, though it also functioned as a factory chimney for John Edward Wainhouse's dye works. </p> <p>The real reason for its huge height, elaborate design and the viewing platform was to spite his neighbour and local dignitary Sir Henry Edwards, who had boasted of his estate being the most private in Halifax, completely invisible to outsiders. Wainhouse put an end to that.</p> <p>More extreme still was an actual skyscraper. Corina Kavanagh was a wealthy resident of Buenos Aires, and legend has it that she was in love with the son of Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena. Kavanagh was rich but not from an aristocratic family, so Anchorena had blocked the romance. She seethed and bided her time, waiting until the family planned to build a new grander mansion closer to the Basilica of the Holy Sacrament, the church the family had funded and which contained their private mausoleum. </p> <p>Kavanagh then snapped up the plot between the old mansion and the church. She built not a house but what was then the tallest skyscraper in Latin America, to obliterate any vestiges of a view. The Edificio Kavanagh has become a landmark, a little slice of Manhattan transported across the equator. </p> <p>Designed by architects Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis María de la Torre in 1934 and completed in 1936, it is an Art Deco masterpiece, like a tall ship breaking through the waves. Kavanagh occupied the biggest apartment on the 14th floor and was able, from her terrace, to look down on the Anchorena family mansion.</p> <p>There is another side to this architecture of raw emotion. When the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, set itself up as a beacon of hate, staging vocal and vile abusive protests against gay people, transgender people, atheists, Muslims, Jews and even other Christians, they made themselves stalwarts of the news. </p> <p>Aaron Jackson, founder of the humanitarian non-profit Planting Peace, raised money to buy the single-storey house opposite the church in 2012. They then painted it in the rainbow colours of the Pride flag. If there is an opposite to the spite house, this might be it, christened the Equality House.</p> <p>The popularity of the spite house as an archetype is down to its stories. Architecture steeped in those most human of emotions becomes so much more than just a building. So the question might be, what's wrong with spite architecture? Why shouldn't architecture occasionally be negative? </p> <p>The stories affect us because we can relate to them. Many of us have fallen out with the family, a neighbour, a developer or the council and wished they could kick back. Architecture is usually a tool of the powerful — but it can also be used by the relatively powerless as a lever.</p> <p>Perhaps that's why so many survive: they become a part of our insatiable need for stories of grit in adversity. And the more profound the spite, the more enduring the structure. These fragments of buildings attest to the whole of our nature, not just those parts we'd like to celebrate.</p> <p><em>Edwin Heathcote is the FT's architecture and design critic</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Edwin Heathcote 2021 'The architecture of spite — bricks, mortar and raw emotion' FT.com 13 August.
