  "title": "'Lightyear' Banned in 14 Markets for Including Same-Sex Relationship; Ban of spinoff of Pixar favorite \"Toy Story\" shows difficulty of expanding film-studio, streaming- company footprints to places with strict censorship regimes",
  "text": "<p>Authorities in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Jordan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Palestinian territories, Syria and Iraq have all banned the film's theatrical release.</p><p>Some countries, especially those with stringent rules about movie content, typically ask studios to edit out material seen as controversial and offensive. Disney typically refuses to make cuts or changes that interfere with the integrity of a movie or that it views as inequitable, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>No decisions have been made beyond the theatrical release stage, and it isn't known whether \"Lightyear\" would be shown in the markets on Disney+, the spokeswoman said. Depicting same-sex relationships or promoting LGBT rights in a movie is illegal in many Middle Eastern countries regardless of how the content is distributed, including in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, where same-sex sexual activity is punishable by corporal punishment and sometimes the death penalty.</p><p>\"Lightyear\" is set for North American release this weekend. It is Pixar's 26th animated feature film and tells the origin story of Buzz Lightyear, the toy space ranger who was the hero of Pixar's first film, 1995's \"Toy Story.\"</p><p>\"Lightyear\" is also the first Pixar film to be released in theaters since 2020's \"Onward,\" a feature about two elf brothers on a quest to contact their dead father that hit theaters five days before Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic. Cinemas were closed as were most public-entertainment venues. \"Onward\" failed at the box office, grossing just $65 million domestically, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com.</p><p>During the pandemic, Disney released three Pixar features—\"Soul,\" \"Luca\" and \"Turning Red\"—straight to Disney+ without allowing a window for theatrical release. Now that theaters in most countries have reopened to a surge in pent-up demand from moviegoers, Disney is betting that audiences for family entertainment will get off the living room sofa as well.</p><p>\"Lightyear\" had a production budget of around $200 million, and box-office tracker Comscore expects the movie to produce around $75 million in domestic ticket sales in its opening weekend. The most recent movie in the \"Toy Story\" franchise—2019's \"Toy Story 4\"—opened to $121 million in domestic box office receipts and went on to gross more than $1 billion world-wide, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com.</p><p>In March, Disney and chief executive Bob Chapek were swept up in controversy surrounding Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill—which since has become law—a measure that prohibits teaching some elementary school students about human sexuality and gender identity.</p><p>Amid backlash over Disney'sinitial failure to condemn the bill publicly, animators at Pixar sent a letter to Disney executives saying the company had censored some displays of same-sex affection in Pixar's movies, according to parts of the letter posted on Twitter.com.</p><p>\"Nearly every moment of overtly gay affection is cut at Disney's behest, regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar,\" the Pixar letter read. \"Even if creating LGBTQIA+ content was the answer to fixing the discriminatory legislation in the world, we are being barred from creating it.\"</p><p>The accusation of censorship was understood to be a reference to the kiss in \"Lightyear.\" Some executives pushed to have the kiss cut, but it was later restored, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>'Lightyear' Banned in 14 Markets for Including Same-Sex Relationship</p>",
