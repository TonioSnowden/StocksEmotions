  "text": "<p>Pearson reported stronger-than-expected sales and profits for last year, as the education publisher battles to win investors' backing for its new direct-to-consumer strategy and revive its languishing share price. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 group said in a trading update that full-year sales were up 8 per cent and forecast an adjusted operating profit of £385m, up 33 per cent compared with the previous year and ahead of analysts' expectations. </p> <p>Chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6760ce02-cf09-495e-8377-55011290c84c\">Andy Bird</a>, a former senior Disney executive brought in last year, is under pressure to return the company to growth after years of disappointing returns. </p> <p>He has put a digital first, subscription model sometimes likened to Netflix at the heart of his plan. </p> <p>Dubbed Pearson+, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54fd50fe-f15f-47c0-965d-797573c5ec9c\">the service</a> offers students access to the full Pearson library for $14.99 a month and was launched last year. However, investors are concerned that falling college enrolments in the US will undermine the company's efforts.</p> <p>Pearson's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de656dda-45b5-4fb5-b327-9ca300744797\">share price plummeted</a> after its last trading update in October, despite a 10 per cent rise in underlying revenue that showed the company was on course to meet its targets. </p> <p>The stock had risen more than 6 per cent by mid-morning UK trading on Wednesday. Bird said the increase highlighted the “overreaction the market had” in the third quarter. Pearson will provide guidance for 2022 when it reports full-year results next month.</p> <p>Pearson said the number of registered users on its digital platform had increased to 2.75m, including 133,000 paid subscriptions since its launch. </p> <p>Roddy Davidson, analyst at Shore Capital, said investors would be encouraged by plans for charting “calmer waters” as pandemic restrictions lifted and allowed face-to-face learning and training alongside online opportunities.</p> <p>“It's more of a positive message overall, with regard to pursuing the digital transition and becoming more consumer focused, and that's what investors want to see,” he added. </p> <p>Pearson's strongest sales growth last year was in its assessments business, which runs professional and student exams globally, and English language learning. Sales in higher education, including North American university courseware, fell, the company said. </p> <p>Bird said the last quarter had seen higher than expected sales in US university material, as students returning to campus bookshops made purchases that had been impossible during lockdowns. </p> <p>But he argued analysts had been disproportionately focused on higher education, adding the company planned to tap into a growing appetite for learning outside of traditional universities, such as workplace training. </p> <p>While Pearson+ was initially focused on higher education the company planned to go “beyond” the sector, he said. “We've got to start redefining what higher education is . . . in the past it was designed around universities and colleges. These days you can continue your higher education at work.”</p> <p>Sales in the company's workforce training division, which includes the provision of vocational BTEC courses and apprenticeships in the UK, increased 6 per cent across the year.</p><p>Source: Bethan Staton 2022 'Pearson lifts 2021 profit forecast as education publisher bets on new strategy ' FT.com 19 January.
