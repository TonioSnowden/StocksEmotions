  "text": "<p>“The Matrix: Resurrections” (Dec. 22) will be the last Warner Bros. movie to premiere on AT&amp;T's T HBO Max the same day it hits theaters — a pandemic experiment that will not continue in 2022. Nearly two decades since the the trilogy concluded (or so we thought), “Resurrections” brings back Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss for a new chapter in the mind-bending (and mind-blowing) sci-fi movie series. It'll stream for 31 days, but only for Max subscribers who are on the ad-free tier.</p><p>Also see: What's worth streaming in December 2021: ‘The Witcher,' ‘Book of Boba Fett,' ‘Matrix: Resurrections' and more</p><p>The “Sex and the City” gang (minus Kim Cattrall's Samantha) will reunite for “And Just Like That…” (Dec. 9), as Carrie&#xa0;(Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda&#xa0;(Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte&#xa0;(Kristin Davis) — now in their 50s — navigate their ever-complicated lives and friendships.
