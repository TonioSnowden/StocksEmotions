  "text": "<p>Although details about what events the new series will cover are still unclear, \"The Kardashians\" is set to follow the same formula as \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" the 2007-2021 E! reality series that launched members of the family to A-list fame. The show promises to give insight into the Kardashian women's work as influencers and business woman, along with the pressures that come with motherhood and raising children in the spotlight. Kris Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian West, Khlo? Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner will all return from the original reality series to star in the new Hulu show.</p><p>The teaser, set to a cover of the Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse standard \"Feeling Good,\" shows the members of the family posing as mannequins in glass display cases, only for a tap from Kendall to break the glass. \"All the walls will be shattered,\" the trailer teases.</p><p>A new reality series starring the Kardashians has been in development since late 2020, when Disney announced a deal with the family to develop new content for Hulu. At the time, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" had just announced that its upcoming 20th season would be its last. The show was originally set to premiere sometime in 2021, but production didn't start until late in the year when it was reported that the family had teamed with Fulwell 73 to produce the show.</p><p>\"The Kardashians\" is executive produced by Fulwell 73 partner Ben Winston, along with Emma Conway and Elizabeth Jones. Danielle King also executive produces in addition to showrunning. Following its premiere in April, the show will air new episodes weekly on Thursdays.</p>",
