  "text": "<p>Parents who had been holding off on air travel are starting to make plans to see family or take an ambitious vacation. Such bookings would be a welcome sign for airlines, hotels and other businesses waiting for more customers to trust traveling again. It also would come as a relief for families who have been largely cooped up for nearly two years.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What kind of family trips are you planning? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Many families changed how they travel during the pandemic, including canceling vacations. Forty-four percent of respondents to the most recent U.S. Family Travel Survey by the Family Travel Association and New York University took a family trip in 2020, well below the 70% of respondents who said they expected to travel in the 2019 survey. And 36% of respondents said they picked a destination they could drive to rather than fly.</p><p>Stacey and Bill Kydd of Escondido, Calif., and their children used to fly frequently on vacation and see family on the East Coast. They haven't flown since the pandemic, instead driving to see family in Austin, Texas, and to the Grand Canyon.</p><p>They plan to fly in December to the Toronto area to visit members of Mr. Kydd's family they haven't seen in more than two years. His mother has Alzheimer's, and it has been difficult to connect over Zoom. Stacey and Bill Kydd are fully vaccinated, as is their 14-year-old daughter. But they are prepared to cancel the tickets if their 11-year-old daughter isn't fully vaccinated by their Dec. 19 flight. \"If it's a week short or something, we will discuss it,\" says Ms. Kydd, a 46-year-old stay-at-home mom. \"We're just in a holding period right now.\"</p><p>Some families have rushed to book appointments. Last spring, Alice Daer, 48, who lives in the Phoenix area and is CEO of a writing-consulting company, planned a December Hawaii vacation for her husband and 10- and 8-year-old children. She figured at least she and her husband would be vaccinated, and she could cancel if her children couldn't get their shots.</p><p>Now, she can't wait to get the kids vaccinated. They have a Nov. 13 appointment at a drive-through clinic, which means their antibodies would be kicking in right when the family boards the plane to Hawaii in mid-December. \"The timing couldn't be better,\" she says.</p><p>The pandemic has reshaped how families approach travel. More than half of respondents surveyed in the family-travel study in June and July say they pay more attention to health and safety now when choosing destinations. Forty percent say they are now more likely to travel using their own car, rather than other forms of transportation for future trips.</p><p>While many families are eager to travel, those with newly vaccinated children won't all rush to book immediately, says Lynn Minnaert, a professor at NYU's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, who worked on the family travel study. She points to limited availabilities and higher travel costs this holiday season.</p><p>\"Spring break, the summer holidays next year, we will see many more families in the air,\" she said.</p><p>Families will have to watch for updates related to vaccine requirements for younger children, travel advisers say. Carnival Cruise Line plans to operate vaccinated cruises and follow all existing protocols through at least the end of February. The company says getting children into the fully vaccinated category will allow more of them on board. There are limited exemptions for unvaccinated passengers.</p><p>Some families are still awaiting approval of a vaccine for their youngest children before making any big travel plans. Mikell Taylor, 37, a robotics engineer who lives in Acton, Mass., said she hoped her family would have holiday-season travel plans—maybe an international trip to visit family and friends. She doesn't feel comfortable putting her children, 6 and 4, on a plane until they are fully vaccinated. \"We got past the point where we could have any certainty about feeling comfortable traveling, so we kind of gave up,\" she says.</p><p>Ms. Taylor plans to get her daughter vaccinated right away. Her son—the 4-year-old—has a form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome, so the family has taken great caution throughout the pandemic. They plan to get him vaccinated as soon as he is eligible.</p><p>\"I suspect we'll be traveling by next summer,\" she says.</p><p>Some parents remain skeptical about getting their children vaccinated right away. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 27% of parents of 5-to-11-year-olds were eager to get a vaccine for their child as soon as one was authorized while 33% said they would wait to see how the vaccine was working.</p><p>Hannah Hall, 29, of Gulfport, Miss., plans to go to Walt Disney World next week with her husband and 8-year-old daughter. It will be the first big trip the family has taken since before the pandemic—and their first by plane.</p><p>Ms. Hall, a stay-at-home mom, and her husband are fully vaccinated. They plan to get their daughter vaccinated eventually, though she says they will wait a few months to learn more about potential side effects. Ms. Hall says they all had Covid-19 and have recovered.</p><p>Before they booked the Disney trip in August, Ms. Hall says they thought about whether they should wait until Covid-19 cases declined, or until the pandemic was over. \"We realized we need to just choose a time that works for us and hopefully Covid will be in a good situation at that point, and we can enjoy our trip. But we can't keep waiting and waiting,\" she says.</p><p>Write to Allison Pohle at Allison.Pohle@wsj.com</p><p>The Kids Are Getting Their Covid-19 Vaccine, the Parents Are Buying Plane Tickets</p>",
