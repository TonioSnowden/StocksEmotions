  "title": "Louis Saha: in search of challenges beyond the pitch",
  "text": "<p>In August 2001, Louis Saha scored for Fulham against Sunderland in the English Premier League, one of the world's most watched football competitions. The French striker recalls feeling elated: “Like, I was not touching the floor any more.”</p> <p>Still on an adrenaline high, he celebrated by spending £15,000 to buy a motorbike. The only problem was that Saha didn't actually have a licence to ride it. It was the purchase of a man who was then young, newly rich, and a little reckless.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I always like [telling] that story as it was my moment where I realised that I needed to be really careful because things can go horribly wrong,” says Saha, now 42, over a Zoom call from his home on the Cote d'Azur in south-eastern France.</p> <p>The striker enjoyed 16 years playing in elite football, starting at French club Metz in 1997, through to stints at several English Premier League teams, before ending his career at Italy's Lazio.</p> <p>Through that time, he enjoyed the sport's many highs. At Manchester United he won two Premier League titles and a Champions League, Europe's top club competition. And he represented the French national team 20 times, scoring four goals.</p> <p>Saha also suffered crushing lows. Injuries plagued his career, leaving him being considered one of the game's more unfulfilled talents. But it turns out, though, there were worse things to endure, as he recites a series of stories about squandering his wealth off the pitch. Such as the time he found out he owed thousands of pounds on his home utility bill. Or another occasion, when he invested in a supposedly tax-efficient scheme, only being forced to pay a “six figure sum” to British tax authorities following an audit. (One estimate suggests about 500 Premier League players invested in such schemes, losing up to £1bn in the process).</p> <p>For Saha, though, the worst experience came when reviewing a new playing contract at a club that he declines to name. In the fine print, he discovered his agent had agreed a six-figure commission to be paid to an associate of the club. Saha was astonished to be told to pay a huge sum to a man he didn't even know.</p> <p>Though Saha felt compelled to accept the deal, he cut ties with the agent. “It was unacceptable,” says Saha. “You're working for me, not working for a club or anybody else . . . It was absolutely, absolutely mad.”</p> <p>He looks back on these incidents and suggests they have a common theme: he was poorly advised at a time others exploited his lack of knowledge in financial affairs. This has given him a world-weary understanding of why many top footballers lose their fortunes gained through their extraordinary physical talent. These are young men, often with little formal education, whose fame attracts a host of hangers-on seeking the opportunity to make quick money.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The problem is you will have to trust somebody, and to pick the right people [to manage your wealth],” he says. “It's not like you're buying a car, and you find out straight away that the car is not working. Finance is a bit different. [It can] take two, three, four years before you actually find out [whether you have been badly advised]. So it's a huge problem.”</p> <p>Saha's experience is hardly exceptional. Research by XPro, a charity for former players, has suggested as many as 60 per cent of former Premier League players had declared bankruptcy within five years of retiring. Many experience divorces and mental health problems soon after hanging up their boots.&#xa0;</p> <p>Saha, who also soon after retiring, separated with his partner with whom he had three children, says he was lucky enough to still remain relatively well off. He remains connected to the game, known to pop up as a television pundit for matches on occasion, but has sought a new challenge since he retired.</p> <p>His experiences led him in 2014 to begin work on AxisStars, a social networking company that aims to guide athletes and entertainers in making sound financial decisions.</p> <p>Advisers, lawyers and agents pay a fee to join AxisStars where they are vetted by the company's management. After they have provided a service to members, they can be given a rating, similar to that seen in apps such as Uber or Airbnb, so other members gain an indication of their quality of work.</p> <p>“We are trying to be a central place where you could find all the resources,” says Saha.&#xa0;</p> <p>The concept went through various iterations, before he joined up in 2018 with business partner and co-owner Kate Hamer, a digital marketing executive at groups such as Unilever and Walt Disney.&#xa0;</p> <p>He says that among the 400 “members” to join AxisStars is Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, alongside former Premier League footballers, rugby players, musicians and comedians. They can access the services of about 100 professional groups and individuals seeking to market their services.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is not a big business. In UK Companies House, the group files only “micro companies accounts”, a designation provided to businesses with small balance sheets. It is planning to launch fundraising through Seedrs, a crowdfunding platform for retail investors. AxisStars said it has been in testing and only started generating revenues last year.</p> <p>None of which sounds like it will soon fund the millionaire lifestyle Saha became accustomed to as a player. While the company's growth matters to him, personal enrichment does not appear to be the central goal of the enterprise.</p> <p>“I earned enough money to realise I need to do something about it [bad financial advice], for others to not make the same mistakes,” he says.</p> <p>With that in mind, the focus is making AxisStars a trusted place for former athletes, and a project to channel his energies after football.</p> <p>“I feel like now the new goal is to actually build things with purpose,” he says. “We are taking in our time, making sure that we partner ourselves in terms of strategy with the right people, the one who really wants to address the problem the correct way.”</p> <p>This all sounds rather worthy for a man who admits the expensive, flashy purchases in fatter days. Did he ever get a motorbike licence for instance? “No,” he says with a laugh. “I've got my scooter. That's fine.”</p> <p>Surely working long hours as the founder of a start-up is no replacement for the joy of scoring in front of 76,000 roaring fans at Old Trafford, Manchester United's famous ground? Does he miss the game?</p> <p>“There are moments where I look at United and I look at some games [and think I want] to be playing in front of all that talent,” he says. “[But I don't] want to do all the hard training, that's for sure, all that travelling, especially with the new [fixture] calendar, they're playing every two, three days. It's crazy, the intensity of the game.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Football provided fame and adoration. But Saha&#xa0;reckons that, perhaps, business offers a greater challenge, a different kind of fulfilment.</p> <p>“I do feel very proud of what I'm doing right now, because it's outside my comfort zone,” he says. “I feel like I've developed myself as a citizen more than when I was a player.”</p><p>Source: Murad Ahmed 2021 'Louis Saha: in search of challenges beyond the pitch' FT.com 14 March.
