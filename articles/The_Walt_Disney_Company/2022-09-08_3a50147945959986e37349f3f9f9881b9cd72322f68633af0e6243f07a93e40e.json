  "title": "'I was not prepared to take on a major distraction': Former Disney CEO shares why he balked at a Twitter deal; As Tesla's Elon Musk seeks to back out of his Twitter deal agreement, former Disney chief Bob Iger elaborated on why the media giant declined to buy Twitter itself",
  "text": "<p>Speaking at the Code Conference Wednesday, Iger explained that he and other Disney executives were intrigued by the prospect of bringing Twitter into their business as they sought to expand into streaming and broaden their avenues for distribution, according to a recap of the presentation by Vox.</p><p>Iger and his team were \"really ready to execute\" on a deal after convincing the board of directors on the matter, but after thinking it over, Iger realized he was \"not looking at this as carefully as I need to look at it,\" he explained. Whereas Tesla's TSLA Musk inked a deal for Twitter and is now set for a court battle as he seeks to terminate the arrangement, Iger backed away before agreeing to anything.</p><p>While Disney saw distribution benefits to having Twitter in-house, Iger, in the end, doubted whether the service fit in with Disney's brand given \"all the hate speech and potential to do as much harm as good.\" Though he acknowledged that there's been recent criticism of Disney's business and efforts, he said that the company is \"in the business of manufacturing fun…of doing nothing but good.\"</p><p>To add Twitter to the mix would have been \"irresponsible,\" he continued.</p><p>Back when Musk was still interested in owning Twitter, he was critical of the company's approach to moderation and suggested he would take a more lax stance, with plans to reinstate former President Donald Trump's account and reserve permanent bans for other scenarios, like bot status.</p><p>See more: Elon Musk says he'll reverse Twitter's ban of Donald Trump</p><p>Musk said he is seeking to back out of his Twitter acquisition agreement because the company hasn't been truthful about the extent of bot or spam activity on its platform. The Tesla chief contends that bot accounts represent a greater portion of Twitter's user base than the company has disclosed.</p><p>Iger said in the Code Conference presentation that he also looked into the bot matter when considering a bid for Twitter.</p><p>\"Interestingly enough, because I read the news these days, we did look very carefully at all of the Twitter users — I guess they're called users? — and we at that point estimated with some of Twitter's help that a substantial portion — not a majority — were not real,\" he said.</p><p>Twitter's legal team says that Musk's real reason for seeking to terminate the deal is an adverse market climate. Social-media stocks were higher when Musk made his offer for Twitter, but recent market declines may make the purchase price appear steep in the current environment.</p><p>In the case of Disney's deal exploration, however, dynamics were different. Iger said Wednesday that the bot-user issue was \"built into our economics\" and that \"actually,\" the deal that Disney contemplated for Twitter \"was pretty cheap.\"</p><p>'I was not prepared to take on a major distraction': Former Disney CEO shares why he balked at a Twitter deal</p>",
