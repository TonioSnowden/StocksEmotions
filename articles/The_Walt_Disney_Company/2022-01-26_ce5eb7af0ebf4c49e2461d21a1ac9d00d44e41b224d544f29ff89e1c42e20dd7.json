  "text": "<p>Shares of Mattel gained almost 8% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it won the license to produce toys based on Walt Disney's princess lineup, and from the \"Frozen\" franchise.</p><p>Stocks have been rocked in recent days by expectations that the Fed will embark on a series of rate increases this year to temper heightened inflation. The prospect of a shrinking balance sheet and higher rates has prompted some to sell risky assets, including shares of technology companies that promise future returns, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine that have drawn the focus of NATO allies.</p><p>Economists expect the Fed to confirm expectations that it will start raising rates in March when it releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET. Traders in interest-rate futures markets are betting that the Fed will increase rates four or five times this year, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"Today the focus is going to be on the Fed,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \"It's more about the tone of the press conference. People may have an expectation that given the market turmoil and the geopolitical tensions the Fed may tone down its rhetoric.\"</p><p>The VIX, a measure of expected volatility that is sometimes dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge, ticked down 2.2 points to 29. The gauge rose this week as stock markets fell.</p><p>Results season continues, and Tesla and Intel are slated to report after markets close. Tesla shares added 3.8%.</p><p>In other stocks, shares of Texas Instruments gained 5% after the company reported higher revenue.

Yields move inversely to prices.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 jumped 2%, with the biggest gains in the travel and leisure sector. Stock indexes in Asia closed mixed. China's Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively.
