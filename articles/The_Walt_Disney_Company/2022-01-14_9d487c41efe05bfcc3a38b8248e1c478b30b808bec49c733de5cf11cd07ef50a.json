  "text": "<p>   Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., the largest owner of regional sports channels, said its sports unit has secured $600 million in debt financing as it develops a streaming service that it aims to launch by the third quarter. </p><p>   The company said it also renewed its deal with the National Basketball Association for the digital rights to air live games on a streaming platform. </p><p>   That agreement comes shortly after its similar contract renewal with the National Hockey League. </p><p>   As a result of these contracts, Sinclair will be able to offer a subscription streaming service that allows consumers to watch local-market games for 16 NBA teams and 12 NHL teams without having a cable or satellite TV package. </p><p>   Sinclair's Diamond Sports Group LLC, a subsidiary that owns the company's portfolio of 21 sports networks, has been working toward building a streaming service. The sports channels were branded as Bally Sports in a 2020 licensing deal with casino operator Bally's Corp. </p><p>   \"This financing and the NBA deal, combined with the NHL deal done back in December, paves the way for us to launch our direct-to-consumer offering with all of our NBA and NHL teams,\" Sinclair Chief Executive Chris Ripley said in an interview. </p><p>   Mr. Ripley said Sinclair has Major League Baseball digital-rights deals in some of its markets. </p><p>   Regional sports networks, once engines of growth for media companies due to the high fees owners were able to charge cable and satellite companies to be included in traditional pay-TV packages, have been hit hard by cable cord-cutting. Pivoting to streaming has become a high priority. </p><p>   Diamond has a hefty debt load of more than $8 billion, stemming from Sinclair's acquisition of sports networks from Walt Disney Co. in 2019 for $10.6 billion. Sinclair's creditors were bracing for a possible restructuring as of late 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   Several of those creditors have signed on to provide additional financing. Bloomberg reported last week that Sinclair was nearing the financing deal. </p><p>   The company is planning for a so-called soft launch of the streaming app in the second quarter, meaning it would be available only in some markets, Mr. Ripley said. A broader rollout to the rest of the company's markets will happen by the third quarter, he said. </p><p>   Mr. Ripley said all of the live games featured on Bally Sports networks will air on the streaming service when it launches. </p><p>   He declined to disclose the pricing for the streaming service. He said it would be \"consistent with some of the other premium sports services in the marketplace.\" </p><p>   The NBA's League Pass carries out-of-market games for $28.99 a month, or $139 annually. </p><p>   Sinclair and its peers will have to navigate a tricky path, trying to build streaming businesses for their regional sports networks without hurting their traditional TV business. </p><p>   \"All research points to very minimal cannibalization,\" Mr. Ripley said. \"There is a growing fandom outside of the (cable) bundle happening. Regardless of where sports ends up being housed, we need to have a product for both.\" </p><p></p>",
