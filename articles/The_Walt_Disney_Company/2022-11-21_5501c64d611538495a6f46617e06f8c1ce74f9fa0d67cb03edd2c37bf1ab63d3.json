  "text": "<p>Bob Iger, who served as Disney chief executive for 15 years, has replaced successor Bob Chapek after a rocky tenure that lasted just 33 months. </p> <p>Iger, who handpicked Chapek as his successor only to see the relationship quickly sour, will serve another two years in the job that made him one of the world's most celebrated business leaders. </p> <p>In a statement, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/725b01e3-d084-43ce-8fde-e1569668ad2a\">Disney</a> said that Iger had “a mandate from the board to set the strategic direction for renewed growth”. He will also work closely with the board to find a successor. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/aa88e9f7-198c-4e9a-9d66-795c8c7251dc\">Iger</a>, who delayed his retirement four times before finally leaving the company, said in a memo to staff on Sunday that he felt “a bit of amazement” that he was returning to the company as chief executive.</p> <p>Disney shares jumped 8 per cent in pre-market trading in New York on Monday. Before today, the stock had fallen more than 40 per cent this year amid growing investor concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c82e33b-6b33-45ea-8bfd-9387dedb8736\">high costs of its&#xa0;streaming business</a>. Disney has spent billions — its content budget this year alone was $30bn — as it competes with Netflix and other streamers for subscribers.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. FTX businesses owe more than $3bn to largest creditors </strong>The crypto exchange FTX and linked companies founded by Sam Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d826ca9-389e-41ec-a38b-da43211da974\">filed a list of their 50 largest creditors</a> yesterday, all of which are customers and owed more than $20mn, with two of them due more than $200mn. </p> <p><strong>2. Joe Biden's antitrust adviser warns of ‘profusion of junk fees' </strong>In an interview with the Financial Times, Tim Wu said there was a “sense there had been a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f31534fa-e9e0-495f-bd43-7f65c5758624\">profusion of junk fees across the [US] economy</a>, things that confuse people, coercive fees, deceptive practices”, as he pushes to expand the war on hidden costs to include those in the securities market.</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“We want to develop almost a jurisprudence of pricing or junk fees that agencies understand and have a playbook to work from.” — Tim Wu</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. US retailers face first real-terms fall in sales since financial crisis </strong>Retailers should report headline sales growth of 4.5 per cent year on year this holiday season, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. But after stripping out the inflation that&#xa0;has caused retailers to increase prices to offset their own higher costs, that would equate to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce51ac1b-c694-4460-8aae-3ae4dc87ad49\">real-terms drop</a> of 1.2 per cent.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tesla supplier warns of graphite supply risk in ‘opaque' market </strong>Western supply of graphite will be constrained in the coming decade, the world's largest natural graphite producer outside China has warned. Shaun Verner, chief executive of Australia's Syrah Resources, said that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46e5c98e-f9cd-4e88-8cd5-23427522c093\">lack of transparency over pricing</a> in the market for the key battery material was making bankers hesitant to fund new projects.</p> <p><strong>5. UN climate summit ends in discord </strong>Poor countries suffering from the effects of climate change will get financial help from richer nations under a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3a6ea05-1357-4564-a448-27b16a376a4a\">historic agreement at COP27</a> yesterday. But negotiators failed to reach a deal on greater cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and an end to fossil fuel use.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Corporate earnings </strong>Zoom, Dell Technologies and Urban Outfitters <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b54df7ab-64ff-4e19-9676-533d39dbe480\">publish results for the third quarter</a>, while Agilent Technologies has fourth-quarter earnings. </p> <p><strong>World Cup </strong>Attention shifts to the first full day of opening fixtures, including Wales vs USA.
