  "title": "Technology & Media:  Some Disney Employees Question  Planned Relocation to Florida  ----  By Erich Schwartzel",
  "text": "<p>   Of the thousands of employees watching Walt Disney Co.'s public clash with Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, one whipsawed group has found itself in an unusual position: They have been asked to move to a state now in combat with their employer. </p><p>   In July, Disney told some 2,000 members of its storied Parks division that they had to relocate from Southern California to Florida or risk losing their jobs. Employees said they were given 90 days to decide. Then, in March, members of the relocating group called on company leaders to speak out against Florida legislation limiting classroom discussion of gender and sexuality. In the weeks since, Disney has become a top political target in Florida, just as these employees consider down payments on new homes there. </p><p>   The timing of the Parks relocation has placed the Disney workers in a crossfire of state lawmakers and the world's largest entertainment company. The group represents a fraction of Disney's approximately 190,000-member workforce, but the group's experience underscores the tricky terrain companies walk when they publicly engage on social issues increasingly becoming a state-by-state debate. What Disney and employees expected to be a difficult but manageable transition has become fraught for both sides. </p><p>   Workers have had a variety of responses to relocating. Some employees have already opted to move to Florida, a Disney spokeswoman said, adding that, overall, more workers have said they would relocate than the company initially expected. </p><p>   Yet displeasure with the move has prompted months of rancor that are unusual for Disney, which had traditionally been a company where disputes rarely spilled into public view and employees were reluctant to criticize leaders. </p><p>   In recent weeks, the Florida fight caused conversations with Disney executives to grow more heated, workers say, and prompted veteran employees who planned to move to start looking for new jobs instead. </p><p>   The relocating employees have become a political symbol for governors. In mid-March, as debate over Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill flared, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a message on Twitter, \"Disney, the door is open to bring those jobs back to California -- the state that actually represents the values of your workers.\" </p><p>   Earlier this month, as Mr. DeSantis railed in speeches against Disney's political stance, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis joked he was offering \"full asylum\" to Mickey and Minnie Mouse in his state. </p><p>   For some, the political has become personal. One veteran Parks worker, for instance, is gay and said he hopes to have a child in the coming years. He has worked for Disney in California for years, but said he wasn't comfortable moving to Florida since the new law, which critics call the \"Don't Say Gay\" law, passed in March. He said he wondered whether his child would feel comfortable discussing his family in a Florida school. </p><p>   The stakes in Disney's fight with Florida over that legislation are rising. Last week, Mr. DeSantis signed into law a bill that would end a special tax district granted to Disney for more than half a century, a move widely viewed as retaliation for Disney's speaking out against the new law. </p><p>   The legislation outlaws classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity through third grade. Disney's criticism of it came after internal and external pressure to speak out, given the company's outsize profile and economic heft in the state. Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek initially had avoided weighing in, warning against his company becoming a \"political football,\" only to see his distancing and subsequent turnabout make Disney into just that. </p><p></p>",
