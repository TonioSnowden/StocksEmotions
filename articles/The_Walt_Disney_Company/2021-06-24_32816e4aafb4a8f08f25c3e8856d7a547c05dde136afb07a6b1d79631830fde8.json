  "text": "<p>   One concern inside Comcast is that it could face a lengthy process to get a major deal approved by antitrust enforcers, some of the people close to management said. </p><p>   In another boost for Peacock, Comcast will end a major licensing deal with WarnerMedia's HBO, which has aired movies from Comcast's Universal studio several months after they run in theaters, people familiar with the decision said. </p><p>   NBCUniversal plans to start shifting some shows to Peacock and become a launchpad for new content: The entire new season of the Bravo show \"Below Deck Mediterranean\" was made available on Peacock a week ahead of the cable network premiere in late June. However, pay TV distributors might not pay as much to carry TV channels if their good content shifts to Peacock, and talent would have to go along with the plans. </p><p>   NBCUniversal had considered moving major NBC network shows like medical drama \"New Amsterdam\" and even hit talent show \"The Voice\" to Peacock, a senior executive said. However, network executives balked at those moves. </p><p>   In the case of police comedy \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" producers and the cast, including star Andy Samberg, also resisted the shift to Peacock, saying it wouldn't be fair to the show's fans to put the last season of the show behind a paywall, people familiar with the situation said. Another factor was that the cast and writers would need compensation of around $16 million to make the move, one of the people said. </p><p>   Matt Strauss, chairman of Peacock, said the service is different from some of the leaders in streaming, partly because it is ad-supported. \"We're not looking to compete head-to-head with them, if anything we think Peacock could become more complementary to Netflix and Disney,\" he said. </p><p>   In distribution, a big question for Mr. Roberts is whether to pursue a takeover of Roku, whose market value has more than tripled in the past year to $53 billion. So far, he's chosen to build a platform internally, capitalizing on years of investments in cable software. </p><p>   The smart TV strategy is especially attractive to Mr. Roberts since it gives Comcast another outlet for international expansion, some of the people familiar with his thinking said. </p><p>   Mr. Roberts has said he looks to Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, for inspiration. \"The thing he said is: Don't obsess on the stock price, obsess on your customers and the quality of your products in the long term,\" Mr. Roberts said at an investor conference in March. \"I think we've tried to do that.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Benjamin Mullin and Joe Flint contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
