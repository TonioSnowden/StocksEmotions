  "title": "Fanatics Pried Baseball Cards From Topps. Now Fanatics Is Buying Topps. The new Fanatics company, valued last year at over $10 billion, accelerated its launch with the $500 million purchase of the company synonymous with baseball cards for decades",
  "text": "<p>When news broke last summer that Fanatics Inc. was poised to upend the trading-card industry, longtime baseball fans wondered what it meant for Topps Co. The iconic company had been synonymous with baseball cards for more than 70 years, a run that seemed destined to end when Fanatics lured away Topps' key licensees.</p><p>But Topps baseball cards will live on—as a part of Fanatics. The sports-merchandise retailer has struck a deal to purchase Topps' trading-card business from Michael Eisner's Tornante Co. LLC and private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners., enabling Fanatics to keep the Topps brand alive. The purchase price was $500 million, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The acquisition accelerates Fanatics' future stranglehold on the business and restores a sense of continuity to an industry undergoing a seismic transformation. Fanatics Trading Cards is now poised to manufacture and distribute baseball trading cards immediately—years ahead of schedule.</p><p>\"We wanted to start with a foundation that was in place,\" said Michael Rubin, Fanatics' chief executive. \"That's a much better approach than building this from scratch.\"</p><p>As recently as August, Topps had planned to go public in a blank-check merger, a deal that valued the company at more than $1 billion. That transaction fell apart after Major League Baseball and its players' union reached an exclusive agreement with the new Fanatics-led trading-card business. Baseball moving to Fanatics left Topps without its most prestigious American licensing partner.</p><p>At the same time, Fanatics Trading Cards reached agreements with the unions representing players in the National Football League and the National Basketball Association, along with the NBA.</p><p>The upheaval sparked tensions across the industry, particularly inside baseball and between Fanatics and Topps, which was co-owned by Eisner, the former Walt Disney Co. chief executive. Baseball fans feared what would happen to the card hobby without the iconic brand it was largely built on.</p><p>At a corporate level, Topps had lost its prized asset—the baseball card licenses—to Fanatics, casting doubts on its future. A Topps spokesman at the time indicated the company was blindsided by baseball's bolt to Fanatics.</p><p>Rubin said he had viewed the acquisition of Topps as a possibility ever since Fanatics seized the baseball-card rights, pointing to the company's history, back catalogue of old rights and existing infrastructure. Still, he admitted that at first, the situation was uneasy given that Fanatics had just torpedoed Topps' plans of going public.</p><p>\"It was, I think, tense up front in the immediate days after,\" Rubin said. \"But Michael Eisner and I spoke weeks after, and he was very congratulatory of us.\"</p><p>Fanatics barging into trading cards represented a dramatic shift in a decades-old industry that was experiencing a boom in popularity, in part spurred by the pandemic. Its foray into baseball was especially nerve-racking to some fans, given the nostalgia associated with the product.</p><p>The new Fanatics business was supposed to have years to figure out a way to allay those concerns. Fanatics Trading Cards' deal with MLB wasn't set to begin until after the 2025 season. But by acquiring Topps' sports and entertainment division, along with its roughly 350 employees, Fanatics is positioned to begin its work in baseball now with a brand already familiar to hobbyists. (The basketball and football players' unions currently have agreements with Panini America, which still run for several more years, before Fanatics takes over.)</p><p>Topps, meanwhile, also produces trading cards for Major League Soccer; Formula One; UEFA, European soccer's governing body; and the Bundesliga, the top professional soccer league in Germany. Those rights now transfer to Fanatics. The combined revenue of the acquired Topps business was around $550 million last year, one of the people familiar with the matter said, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $160 million.</p><p>That adds to the portfolio of a business that has attained an enormous evaluation in a short period. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that a trio of investors—private-equity firm Silver Lake, entertainment giant Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., and Insight Partners, a private-equity and venture-capital firm—invested $350 million in Series A funding that valued Fanatics at about $10.4 billion.</p><p>\"The strong emotional connection between Topps collectibles and consumers of all ages–built through 70 years of tradition, starting with the Shorin family–will make it a jewel in the Fanatics portfolio,\" Eisner said.</p><p>Eisner's Tornante Co. LLC and Madison Dearborn Partners bought Topps in 2007 for $385 million. Those entities will continue to own what remains of the company: confections and gift card divisions that will now be called The Bazooka Companies, Inc., named for the flagship brand of bubble gum Topps introduced in 1947. Executive chairman Andy Redman said the two divisions generated more than $250 million in revenue in 2021.</p><p>Topps was on the verge of going public in August via a deal with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, when The Wall Street Journal reported Fanatics had seizedthe baseball card licenses. That sunk the SPAC deal as it was nearing its completion.</p><p>The various leagues and players unions opted to partner with Fanatics because of their belief that the company could reshape an industry they saw as ripe for transformation. Fanatics, which has licensing deals with the major sports leagues and universities, had already become a behemoth by doing just that in the apparel business. The leagues and the unions also received equity stakes in Fanatics Trade Cards as part of the deal.</p><p>\"We have a vision to expand and do new things to grow new businesses,\" Rubin said. \"A lot of times we'll look to, 'Is it faster to build pieces or to buy pieces?' And if it makes more sense to buy, we're very happy to do that.\"</p><p>Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com and Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com</p><p>Fanatics Pried Baseball Cards From Topps.
