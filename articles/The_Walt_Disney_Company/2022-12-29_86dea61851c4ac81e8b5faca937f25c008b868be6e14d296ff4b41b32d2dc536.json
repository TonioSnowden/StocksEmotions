Through Tuesday's close, the best-performing stock was Occidental Petroleum OXY, up 122%, excluding dividends. The worst performer has been Generac Holdings GNRC, down 74%. 2. The Fed made seven interest-rate hikes in 2022, including four consecutive 75 basis point increases. Some economists say the hikes have already succeeded in one way. 3. Inflation reached a four-decade high in 2022. It peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. It's slowing, but the fight is far from over. 4. President Joe Biden announced in August that his administration planned to cancel up to $10,000 for borrowers earning $125,000 or less and up to $20,000 for borrowers who used a Pell grant in college, but opponents have looked for strategies to mount a legal challenge. 5. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal probe into how $372 million vanished out of FTX-controlled wallets the day that the exchange filed for bankruptcy in November. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried, who is charged with fraud and currently in jail in the Bahamas, will be transferred to the U.S. 6. Musk bought Twitter in October in a deal valued at $44 billion. He subsequently cut the workforce by 50%, equivalent to approximately 3,700 workers. However, one analyst said, \"He sold caviar, to buy a $2 slice of pizza.\" 7. The Fed's ultimate goal is to get long-term inflation back down to 2%. The Fed formally adopted this policy in 2012. 8. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate was 6.27% for the week of Dec. 22.

Earlier this month, Congress passed legislation requiring states to recognize legal marriages regardless of \"sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.\" 3. In June, Congress signed sweeping gun-reform legislation, tightening access to guns. It improves background checks for younger firearm buyers, restricts access for domestic violence offenders, and helps states institute \"red flag\" laws to keep guns out of the hands of high-risk individuals. 4. In August, Biden signed the Chips and Science Act, including $52.7 billion for domestic manufacturing of chips SMH SOXX. 5. A bipartisan group of senators agreed on changes to the Electoral Count Act, the post-Civil War-era law for certifying presidential elections that lawmakers decided requires revision after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and then-President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 10. Liz Truss became U.K. prime minister in September, succeeding Boris Johnson.</p><p>Bonus question: U.K. markets tanked after Truss released her aggressive economic growth and tax plan. She rescinded large parts of the plan, but ultimately resigned after just 44 days, breaking the record for the shortest tenure as prime minister in U.K history. Rishi Sunak, her rival in the initial race for Prime Minister, succeeded Truss.</p><p>Related: Take MarketWatch's 2022 Financial Literacy Quiz.
