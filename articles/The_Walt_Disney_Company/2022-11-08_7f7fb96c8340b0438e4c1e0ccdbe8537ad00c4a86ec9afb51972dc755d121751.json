  "text": "<p>The quarter included the launch of shows and movies from the company's well-regarded brands, including the critically acclaimed Star Wars series called \"Andor.\"</p><p>But streaming still carries a heavy price tag. Operating losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer segment more than doubled year over year to nearly $1.5 billion—worse than the $1.1 billion analysts had been expecting.</p><p>And while Disney financial chief Christine McCarthy described the recent losses as a \"peak\" for the business, the year ahead poses some uncertainty for the company's streaming operation as it works to integrate both a significant price increase for the streaming service and the launch of a new, cheaper advertising-supported tier.</p><p>Disney also lost the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League's cricket seasons that begin in the current fiscal year, which Ms. McCarthy expects to affect subscriber growth.</p><p>Disney is far more than just a streaming company, but its latest results also reflected other areas of weakness. Domestic theme-park revenue came up slightly short of targets, while operating profit in that unit took a hit in part due to the impact of Hurricane Ian in Florida. Linear networks revenue—reflecting advertising and cable fees from the company's TV business—was also 5% shy of Wall Street's projections.</p><p>As a result, Disney's total revenue of $20.5 billion for the quarter was below analysts' estimates, while operating income was $1.6 billion, some 30% lower. That is the widest such margin by which Disney has missed that target in at least five years, according to FactSet. The company also projected growth for its top and bottom lines to be in the high-single-digit range for the new fiscal year ending next September, disappointing investors who expected growth to be in the mid-teen range.</p><p>Disney's share price slumped nearly 7% following the results in after-hours trading. The stock has been holding up better than its other big media peers, with a year-to-date decline of 36% compared with a 46% loss for the S&amp;P 500 Media &amp; Entertainment Group. That reflects Disney's rather deft handling of the challenges posed by the pandemic, which could have been fatal to a company so dependent on packing large numbers of people into small spaces for the purposes of entertainment.</p><p>Disney survived, but not even the Mouse House can fully outrun a recession.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Shows the Limits of Streaming</p>",
