  "title": "'Top Gun' Is Acing Its Theater Run --- Paramount's goal to maximize theatrical returns should inspire other studios",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Cruise's \"Top Gun: Maverick\" topped $1 billion in global box-office revenue over the weekend -- only the second theatrical film to hit that mark since the onset of the pandemic. It maintained a lofty cruising altitude, averaging a 29% weekly decline in domestic box office during its first five weeks in theaters, according to data from Box Office Mojo. The last five theatrical movies based on comic-book superheroes averaged a 46% weekly drop in that time, while \"No Time to Die\" -- featuring Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond -- averaged a 40% weekly drop in the first five weeks following its release last November.</p><p>As the sequel to a 36-year-old Cold War hit, such a level of success for the latest \"Top Gun\" was by no means assured. But the movie seems to have done well at attracting masses beyond those venturing back into theaters for the latest comic-book adaptations. Melissa Thomas, chief financial officer for the Cinemark theater chain, told an investor conference this month that \"more than 25% of our customers that came to see 'Top Gun' had not visited a Cinemark theater in the past year, and more than 30% of those customers were over the age of 55.\"</p><p>Such a success is a major score for Paramount Global, whose namesake studio hasn't had a $1 billion hit since 2014's \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" It should serve as validation of the company's unique decision regarding the streaming future of its latest blockbuster. Paramount has been observing a 45-day window for keeping its movies in theaters before moving them to its Paramount+ streaming service. But the company maintained from the beginning that it planned to let \"Top Gun: Maverick\" stretch its wings for a longer theatrical run of an unspecified length.</p><p>That should give Paramount the best of both worlds: a highly profitable theatrical run and a movie that will work as a high-profile addition to its streaming offering. Rivals should take note. In a rush to capitalize on streaming hype, many studios shortened their theatrical windows to feed high-profile content to their streaming services. Disney reorganized its corporate structure in late 2020, citing its direct-to-consumer platforms that include the Disney+ service as the company's new \"primary focus.\"</p><p>But investors soured on the economics of streaming lately, especially after Netflix seemingly hit a wall. And the intense focus on streaming by many studios may have trained viewers that they can wait out shortened theatrical windows. Disney's \"Lightyear\" was released this month and is the first movie from its Pixar unit that it launched into theaters since the pandemic began; the last three Pixar films went straight to Disney+. The movie has been a relative disappointment, generating less than half the domestic box office in its first two weeks of release compared with the last two films in the \"Toy Story\" franchise, according to the industry-tracking site The Numbers.</p><p>A problem even Tom Cruise can't shoot down is the movie-theater industry's reliance on a dwindling pool of blockbusters. Despite the success of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" this year's domestic box office so far is 37% below the $5.7 billion averaged by this point in the three years before the pandemic, according to Box Office Mojo. That is driving chains like Cinemark and AMC Entertainment to build up businesses showing alternative content such as concerts. Cinemark said on its latest quarterly call in May that a livestreamed concert in March by K-pop phenomenon BTS generated $33 million in box-office sales in two performances -- more than the latest \"Top Gun\" made last weekend. Even Maverick has to face the music.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
