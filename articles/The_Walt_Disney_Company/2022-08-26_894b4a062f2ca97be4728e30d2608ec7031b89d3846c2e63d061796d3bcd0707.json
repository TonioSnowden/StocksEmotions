  "title": "Actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney buy a football club in Welcome to Wrexham — TV review",
  "text": "<p>The lockdown of 2020 was a time for expensive and possibly misguided purchases: hot tubs, breadmakers, reams of toilet paper — and, if you're the actors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/2a7e16a3-286d-4111-96f5-fd3daa67c5a4\">Ryan Reynolds</a> and Rob McElhenney, a fifth division Welsh football team. <br><br>It's easy to be cynical about the acquisition of Wrexham AFC by two celebrities who seem to possess a fumbling grasp of the sport. And the fact that a documentary chronicling their first foray into club ownership was commissioned before the deal was even ratified does little to allay suspicions that this takeover is an elaborate publicity stunt or a means of riding the coat-tails of the hugely popular football-based comedy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db0d3dd4-fe1c-41f3-9a55-11ef2644fbca\"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a><em>. </em>Admittedly, there are more sinister reasons for buying a football team. <br><br>It soon becomes clear while watching <em>Welcome To Wrexham</em> on Disney Plus that this isn't a mere vanity project. In fact, fans of Reynolds (star of Marvel's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06375642-5900-11e8-b8b2-d6ceb45fa9d0\"><em>Deadpool</em></a>) and McElhenney (co-creator and star of <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>) might be disappointed by their at-times peripheral presence in this series, and the earnestness with which they approach their new roles. <br><br>Beyond some gentle bantering between the two, there are surprisingly few moments here that are played for laughs. That said, it's both inadvertently amusing and quite touching to see McElhenney interviewing a managerial candidate from a Hollywood studio lot or talking about a crunch match with Chesterfield while driving around LA.</p> <p>Despite repeatedly stressing their commitment and sense of accountability, the story of how and why the actors joined forces to make this strange investment — never having previously met in person — has been frustratingly abridged here. What McElhenney does mention as a motivating factor is the desire to use a high-profile takeover to help bring change to the town which, he says, reminds him of the forgotten, working-class areas of Philadelphia where he grew up.</p> <p>In line with that aim, the show devotes much of its time to the community, whose post-mining plight has been mirrored by their team's downward spiral over the past 30 years. We're introduced to small business owners, diehard fans and homegrown players, who discuss the club's centrality to their livelihoods and the general local spirit.<br><br>There's perhaps too little varied material here to justify an 18-episode run, but the series offers a timely and refreshing look at football beyond the nauseatingly moneyed upper echelons. It's taken two Hollywood stars to bring wider attention to the value of the unglamorous lower leagues. Credit is owed to Reynolds and McElhenney for that — and for their judicious avoidance of the word “soccer”.</p> <p>★★★☆☆<br><br><em>Two episodes on Disney Plus now; new episodes released on Thursdays </em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney buy a football club in Welcome to Wrexham — TV review' FT.com 26 August.
