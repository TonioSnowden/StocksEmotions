  "title": "Disney Axes Chapek, Iger Returns --- Surprise ouster of CEO follows stock slide and big losses in streaming business",
  "text": "<p>\"We thank Bob Chapek for his service to Disney over his long career, including navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic,\" she added.</p><p>The change comes at a tumultuous time for Disney.</p><p>On Nov. 9, the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter financial results, killing the momentum built up over a strong year that saw record revenue and profits in multiple divisions, especially the one that includes theme parks.</p><p>Disney's theme-park business has recovered strongly since the coronavirus pandemic shut down its venues across the world, but the division continues to subsidize widening losses in the streaming video business.</p><p>Mr. Chapek has said repeatedly that he expects the streaming business to be profitable by September 2024. In the most recent quarter, though, it lost $1.47 billion, more than twice the year-earlier loss.</p><p>The company also cautioned that its profitability target would only be met if there wasn't a significant economic downturn, the first time it has added such a caveat. Disney shares fell 13% the day after the earnings report and are down more than 41% so far this year.</p><p>Disney has also faced pressure from multiple activist hedge-fund investors this year.</p><p>Trian Fund Management LP bought more than $800 million worth of Disney stock in the days following the company's lackluster earnings report, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The stake isn't as large as Trian would like it to be and will likely grow, subject to market conditions, they said.</p><p>The influential activist fund, which was founded by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, is seeking a seat on Disney's board as it pushes the entertainment giant to make operational improvements and cut costs, according to the people. Trian has studied the business for a long time, they added.</p><p>The fund's view is that Mr. Iger shouldn't be back in control of the company, the people said.</p><p>Trian officials argue that Disney in recent years has erred in its mergers-and-acquisitions strategy, the people said. For example, Trian believes that Disney vastly overpaid when it spent $71.3 billion to bring under its umbrella the major entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., they said. (Fox's corporate sibling, News Corp, owns The Wall Street Journal.)</p><p>Trian is known for encouraging changes at the companies it targets, such as the breakup or sale of underperforming divisions or moves to improve efficiency and better use capital. Mr. Peltz has previously served on the board of other consumer-goods companies including Mondelez International Inc., Kraft Heinz Co. and, more recently, Unilever PLC, the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise.</p><p>Trian's interest comes after activist investor Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC said in August that it had taken a stake in Disney stock after having liquidated its position earlier this year. Mr. Loeb sent a letter to Mr. Chapek asking for major changes to the business. He called for Disney to spin off ESPN, refresh its board and cut spending, though a month later he backed off on the demand to change control of the sports channel.</p><p>In response to Mr. Loeb's suggestions, the company appointed Carolyn Everson, a veteran digital advertising executive, to its board, and agreed to a standstill with Third Point.</p><p>In an email to employees Sunday night, Mr. Iger said he was returning to the company.</p><p>\"It is with an incredible sense of gratitude and humility -- and, I must admit, a bit of amazement -- that I write to you this evening with the news that I am returning to the Walt Disney Company as Chief Executive Officer,\" he wrote in the email viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Several top Disney executives first learned the news that Mr. Iger was returning after they read the Sunday email, some of them while together attending an Elton John concert at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles that was streamed live on Disney's flagship streaming service Disney+, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Some of those who were expected to attend the concert included Dana Walden, head of general entertainment content, Craig Erwich, head of content for the Hulu streaming service, Ayo Davis, head of Disney Branded Television and newly appointed Disney+ president Alisa Bowen, the people said.</p><p>Mr. Chapek was also expected to attend the event, and the company had planned for him to introduce Mr. John from the stage before the concert according to two people with knowledge of the plans, but it's not clear if Mr. Chapek attended, they said. Other Disney employees said they were baffled by Mr. Iger's Sunday email, and immediately began asking if the message to employees was real, or if it came from a hacked email account.</p><p>Negotiations between Mr. Iger and the board to return as CEO were initiated only in recent days, according to a person familiar with the talks.</p><p>Mr. Iger, 71 years old, has said publicly on at least two occasions over the last year that he is not interested in returning to Disney. In recent months he has focused on investing in and advising startups, particularly in the technology industry.</p><p>Adding to the surprise, Mr. Chapek, 62, who has served as CEO since February 2020, over the summer saw his contract renewed through the end of 2024.</p><p>At the time, Ms. Arnold, the board chair, said that while the company was \"dealt a tough hand by the pandemic,\" Mr. Chapek \"not only weathered the storm but emerged in a position of strength.\"</p><p>The renewal was closely watched after Disney's high-profile dust-up earlier this year with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican. Disney, which employs more than 70,000 people in the state, stepped into the debate over a controversial education bill in Florida that limits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation for children through the third grade and says material for older children must be \"age appropriate.\"</p>",
