  "text": "<p>A deal was announced Sunday, two days after Walt Disney Co. DIS-owned channels — including ABC, ESPN, FX, National Geographic and the Disney Channel — were pulled from Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGLGOOG YouTube TV live-streaming service over a price dispute.</p><p>“We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney to return their content to YouTube TV while preserving a $64.99/mo. price for our members,” YouTube TV said in a statement Sunday. “We have already started to restore access to Disney networks like ESPN and FX, including their live and on-demand content, as well as any recordings that were previously in your library. We will also be turning on the local ABC stations over the course of the day.”</p><p>YouTube TV added that customers will receive a $15 credit on their monthly bill to make up for the temporary loss of Disney content. On Friday, YouTube TV temporarily dropped its monthly price from $64.99 to $49.99 due to the loss of Disney; that price will now return to its previous level.</p><p>The dispute outraged many YouTube TV customers, who lost ESPN and ABC sports programming just as college football's bowl season was getting underway. ESPN's “Monday Night Football” is still a major draw for viewers, and a new deal was reached in plenty of time to make sure it was available for YouTube TV users.</p><p>Disney's Hulu may have benefited from the temporary channel blackout — a number of angry YouTube TV customers posted on social media over the weekend that they were switching to rival Hulu Live, which carries ESPN, ABC and the other channels.</p>",
