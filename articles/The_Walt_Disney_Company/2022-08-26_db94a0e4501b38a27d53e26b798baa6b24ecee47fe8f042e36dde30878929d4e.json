  "title": "Arts in Review -- Film Review: 'Breaking': His Battle Back Home --- This fact-based movie stars John Boyega as a desperate Marine veteran who takes hostages at a suburban Atlanta bank",
  "text": "<p>Sensitively written by Abi Damaris Corbin and Kwame Kwei-Armah and tautly directed by Ms. Corbin, \"Breaking\" is a kind of Black Lives Matter update of \"Dog Day Afternoon.\" As in that 1975 movie, nearly the entire saga takes place inside a bank where we learn the back story of the pathetic mastermind, the tellers begin to feel sympathy for him, and the big revelation is the unbelievable motive for the crime. But if the hidden substructure of the earlier film was simply that New York in the '70s was a crazy place, this time around the foundational problem is the sensation felt by many black people that they are being ignored, misunderstood, disrespected or shoved to the fringes of society.</p><p>Mr. Boyega, in a tightly controlled performance, plays all of those feelings and more, but most of all he comes across as sad. An Englishman who is best known for his role as the comical Finn in the recent \"Star Wars\" movies, he does perhaps the finest work of his career in finding the nuances of this complex character. Adopting a low, gravelly voice that enhances the character's odd gravitas, Mr. Boyega imbues Brown-Easley with determination and dignity but also a layer of lunacy and paranoia. He manages to seem savvy and stupid at the same time (a description that might also apply to Al Pacino's performance in \"Dog Day\"). Even as he threatens to blow up two people, Mr. Boyega makes it easy to understand why his character's hostages might be more worried about his safety than their own.</p><p>When we first meet Brown-Easley, he is a loving dad who promises to get a puppy for his daughter, Kiah (London Covington), who lives with her mom, his ex Cassandra (Olivia Washington). Threatened with eviction from his motel room and facing homelessness, with no apparent preparation he wanders into a bank in Marietta, Ga., where he scribbles a note: \"I have a bomb.\"</p><p>\"Breaking\" is a most unusual bank-robbery movie: Nobody tries to steal anything. Brown-Easley even refuses an offer of cash from the bank. What he, an Iraq War vet, wants is tied up in a benefits dispute with the Department of Veterans Affairs. In flashbacks, we watch with alarm how he got to this level of frustration; one encounter with the bureaucracy ends with him handcuffed while face-down on the floor. Ms. Corbin doesn't linger on the moment, nor does Mr. Boyega play his character with a halo, but the cultural reverberations of the image are apparent.</p><p>Without making the theme explicit, Ms. Corbin's film sensitively touches on our shared longing to reduce the kinds of nightmare encounters with police that make unwitting celebrities out of some black people. Inside the bank, while the police drag things out in an effort to wear him down, Brown-Easley explains his grievances to a producer (Connie Britton) at a television station he calls in an attempt to create a media frenzy that, to his disappointment, never quite materializes. He also finds common ground with an experienced police sergeant appealingly portrayed by Michael Kenneth Williams, who played Omar on \"The Wire\" and died last year. (This was his final film.) The cop, who also served in the Marine Corps, is nominally an antagonist, but as a fellow black man he has a palpable wish to conclude matters with no one getting hurt. Someone might have told Brown-Easley that the bank robber whose story was chronicled in \"Dog Day Afternoon\" was paroled from prison less than six years after the crime.</p><p>Films about race too often take the easy way out, which tends to yield schematic characters, grandstanding dialogue and thematic stridency; filmmakers seem more interested in emphasizing that they're on the side of the angels than in confronting the messiness of reality. \"Breaking\" doesn't patronize the audience with such oversimplifications. Brown-Easley is indisputably guilty of a serious crime and society is not to blame for his actions. Yet as he struggles to find a way to remain alive, the film builds a heartbreaking sense that his troubles could and should have been avoided.</p>",
