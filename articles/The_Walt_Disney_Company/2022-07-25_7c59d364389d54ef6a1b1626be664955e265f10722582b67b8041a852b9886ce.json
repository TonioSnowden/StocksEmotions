  "text": "<p>\"Deadpool\" follows the adventure of a foul-mouthed mercenary who cracks jokes during assassinations, and features scenes with nudity and sexual themes. \"Logan,\" the story of X-Men superhero Wolverine, was rated R for language, brief nudity and \"brutal violence.\"</p><p>Disney is making a major push into adult-oriented general entertainment content. In recent earnings calls, it highlighted increased spending on shows like \"The Dropout\" and \"The Kardashians,\" both streaming on Hulu, the Disney-owned service that has emerged as Disney's fastest-growing streaming platform. The company says about half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without children.</p><p>In March, Disney added several shows to Disney+, including \"Luke Cage,\" \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Daredevil,\" that had story lines from Marvel comics and came with TV-MA ratings, the television equivalent of an R rating.</p><p>At the time, Disney's direct-to-consumer division required subscribers to opt into more expansive parental controls to access those titles, and it mounted a public-relations campaign to spread the word about the required changes to the Disney+ app's settings.</p><p>The addition of those shows, plus Friday's addition of R-rated movies, prompted outrage from watchdog groups and some parents on social media, who said R-rated movies don't belong in a family-friendly platform like Disney+.</p><p>\"Disney+ was supposed to be a safe space for kids,\" said Melissa Henson, director of programs for the Parents Television and Media Council, a nonpartisan, nonreligious organization that advocates for more family-friendly content on TV and streaming platforms. \"Disney used to be a brand that parents could trust implicitly, and I think that trust has been eroded.\"</p><p>The organization says that when Disney+ was launched in 2019, it committed to not having mature content on its platform. Ms. Henson commended Disney for requiring subscribers to proactively opt-in to content with TV-MA or R ratings but said it should have kept more mature superhero titles on Hulu.</p><p>\"It feels like a bait and switch,\" Ms. Henson said. \"They pull the families in with family-friendly content and now, less than four years later, they're going back on their promise.\"</p><p>Disney has been moving toward more adult themes in its broader content offerings for some time in foreign markets.</p><p>In Europe, the Hulu series \"Pam &amp; Tommy,\" which details the release of a sex tape between actress Pamela Anderson and heavy-metal drummer Tommy Lee, streams on Disney+ through its Star service, which is included on the platform.</p><p>More mature content is coming to Disney+. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige has said that a new Deadpool sequel produced by Disney will also be R-rated. The coming animated series \"Marvel Zombies\" will carry a TV-MA rating.</p><p>Disney says \"Deadpool\" and \"Logan\" belong on Disney+ because the service is home to all Marvel titles, and the decision to add them was \"all driven by brand association.\" The company noted that it did a high level of outreach in March for the shows that were added.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
