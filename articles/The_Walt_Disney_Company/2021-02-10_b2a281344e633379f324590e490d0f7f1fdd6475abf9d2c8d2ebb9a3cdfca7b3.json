  "title": "Business News:  Beachbody  To Form  Fitness  SPAC  ----  By Laura Cooper",
  "text": "<p>   Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer, in a deal that values the company at nearly $3 billion. </p><p>   Beachbody, which is known for its streaming fitness content and nutritional meal plans, will combine with blank-check company Forest Road Acquisition Corp. and trade on the New York Stock Exchange once the deal closes, according to the executives involved in the deal. </p><p>   As part of the deal, Myx Fitness Holdings LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, would become part of Beachbody. </p><p>   Beachbody will own and operate three online fitness businesses, including Beachbody on Demand. Beachbody has more than 2.6 million paid digital subscribers, according to Carl Daikeler, its chief executive. </p><p>   The combined companies are expected to generate more than $1.1 billion of revenue this year, according to a spokeswoman. Beachbody tallied around $880 million in revenue for 2020, she added. </p><p>   The fitness companies join a growing list of businesses going public through mergers with special-purpose acquisition vehicles, which raise money in the public markets with the sole purpose of making an acquisition. Often SPACs must find an acquisition target within a set period, typically two years. They offer an alternative path to the public markets and tend to be faster and easier than a traditional initial public offering. </p><p>   SPACs have been a particularly popular option for private equity-owned companies such as Beachbody, which has been backed by Raine Group since late 2018. Raine will remain an investor in the combined entity, according to Mr. Daikeler. </p><p>   Myx, a startup backed by family office investor Palm Ventures, was founded in 2016. Mr. Daikeler said has sold over 27,000 of their at-home bikes since the company's launch of the product a year ago. Myx recorded a little over $30 million in revenue during its first year, the Beachbody chief executive said. </p><p>   Unlike connected cycling competitor Peloton Interactive Inc., which centers around a user's position on a leaderboard, Myx focuses on tracking an individual user's heart rate, Mr. Daikeler said. </p><p>    Forest Road Acquisition Corp. raised $300 million in an initial public offering last November. After launching, it received interest from 50 companies seeking mergers, said Mr. Mayer, who is also a strategic adviser at Forest Road. </p><p>   Mr. Mayer spent nearly 25 years at Walt Disney Co. and worked on projects, including the launch of Disney+, he said. Most recently, he served as CEO of social media app TikTok before resigning last year. In addition to Mr. Mayer, Forest Road's advisory team includes Tom Staggs, Disney's former chief financial officer and chief operating officer. </p><p>   Forest Road's team was attracted to Beachbody because of the company's focus on the increasingly popular areas of consumer-focused health and wellness, digital content and connected businesses such as at-home online cycling, Mr. Mayer said. He will join the board of Beachbody as a result of the merger. </p><p>   As a result of the deal, the newly merged Beachbody will have some $425 million of cash on its balance sheet to fund growth. </p><p>   Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts. </p><p></p>",
