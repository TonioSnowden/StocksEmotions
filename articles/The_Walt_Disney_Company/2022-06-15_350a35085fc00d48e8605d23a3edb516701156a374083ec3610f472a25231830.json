  "title": "Technology:  Disney Pays $3 Billion  For Cricket TV Rights  ----  By Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co. will pay $3 billion to retain the right to broadcast cricket's popular Indian Premier League on its Star India television network, although it lost streaming rights to rival Viacom18, the Board for Control of Cricket in India, the competition's regulatory body, said Tuesday. </p><p>   The closely watched, multiday auction generated $6.2 billion for the league's organizers, nearly three times the price that rights last sold for at auction in 2017. The winning bid for streaming rights from Viacom18, a joint venture between Paramount Global, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd. and others, was $2.6 billion, the cricket board said. In addition, Viacom18 will pay $493 million for assorted other licenses, including the rights to air matches internationally and a limited-game package. </p><p>   The results of the auction -- conducted digitally over the course of several days -- make IPL cricket the world's second-most valuable sports league on a per-game basis after the National Football League, said Jay Shah, secretary of the BCCI. Competition for the rights became fierce in recent months, with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube unit, Amazon.com Inc., and Sony Pictures Networks India in the mix at various moments, along with Disney and Viacom18, according to the BCCI. </p><p>   \"The important thing here was transparency,\" Mr. Shah said. \"That's what allowed the price to climb so high.\" </p><p>   Disney said early Tuesday that it bowed out of the race for streaming rights because the price got too high. </p><p></p>",
