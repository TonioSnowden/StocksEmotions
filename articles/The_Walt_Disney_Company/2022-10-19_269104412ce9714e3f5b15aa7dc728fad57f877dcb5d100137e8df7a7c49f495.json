  "title": "Hasbro shares down 3% after profit roughly halves in latest quarter, with consumers feeling pressure from inflation; Toy company's numbers also hit by a shift by retailers to order holiday goods earlier to avoid supply-chain snags",
  "text": "<p>Revenue fell 15%, to $1.676 billion from $1.970 billion, matching the FactSet consensus.</p><p>\"As expected, the third quarter is our most difficult comparison and was further impacted by increasing price sensitivity for the average consumer,\" CEO Chris Cocks said in a statement.</p><p>The numbers were also affected by retailers accelerating shipments of consumer products due to fears of supply-chain challenges heading into the holiday season, he said. That led many retailers to shift orders to the second quarter, weighing on third-quarter numbers.</p><p>See also: Macy's will bring Toys 'R' Us to every one of its U.S. stores for the holidays</p><p>Toymakers and other consumer-product companies count on holiday sales for more than half of their annual sales. Some were caught out last year when supply-chain issues left stores with empty shelves.</p><p>Hasbro was also hit by later product releases for Nerf products and games, with the release calendar for its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and Entertainment businesses more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.</p><p>See: Barbie is all virgin plastic for now â€” but Mattel's pledge for less packaging and recycled toys means change is coming</p><p>Also: Christmas in July: Hasbro moves up inventory purchases to make sure there are enough toys for the holidays</p><p>The Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming division houses the company's popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons business, as well as the card game Magic: The Gathering, which is Hasbro's first-ever $1 billion brand, said Cocks.</p><p>Hasbro owns the rights to toys based on the children's show \"Peppa Pig\" and until recently owned the rights to Walt Disney's DIS popular \"Frozen\" franchise,which were   won back by rival Mattel Inc. MAT in January.</p><p>\"To achieve our full-year outlook, we are projecting Hasbro's fourth-quarter revenue to be approximately flat versus last year on a constant currency basis with particular strength from our Wizards and Digital Gaming segment,\" Cocks said.</p><p>MKM analyst Eric Handler said the numbers were mixed but welcomed the fact that guidance remained intact.</p><p>\"We remain believers in Hasbro's Blueprint 2.0 strategy and are much more focused on the company's strong, brand-driven lineup in 2023 and management's renewed focus on bottom-line growth,\" he wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>That will include Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" merchandise, which is expected to extend well into 2023. The company has six other blockbuster films and 20 scripted and unscripted shows that it will be merchandising, said Cocks, including \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,\" coming in March, and \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,\" coming in June.</p><p>MKM has a buy rating on the stock and a $90 price target that's about 36% above its current price.</p><p>Stifel, which also rates the stock a buy with an $84 price target, said the numbers were generally consistent with an update from a recent analyst day.</p><p>Hasbro shares have fallen 36% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has fallen 22%.</p><p>Hasbro shares down 3% after profit roughly halves in latest quarter, with consumers feeling pressure from inflation</p>",
