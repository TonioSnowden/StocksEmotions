  "text": "<p>   Mr. Iger, who is Mr. Chapek's boss for the next few months, didn't want to interfere in day-to-day company matters, including the Johansson suit, according to people who know him. He was on his boat this summer when the dispute erupted. </p><p>   Alan Horn, the longtime Disney Studios head known for decades of star-wrangling, also wasn't involved. He is expected to leave his post when Mr. Iger steps down at the end of the year, part of an executive exodus that will put Mr. Chapek's team fully in charge. </p><p>   The uncertainty and acrimony between Ms. Johansson and Disney has frustrated executives at Marvel Entertainment, the Disney division responsible for creating the most lucrative franchise of modern Hollywood, said people who work with the division. </p><p>   Marvel Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige has presided over a stable of stars with relatively little friction. Disputes remained largely behind the scenes. </p><p>   Around the time Mr. Chapek became chief executive, Mr. Feige was capitalizing on years of planning for his storytelling universe. Disney was spending hundreds of millions of dollars producing Marvel TV shows for Disney+, such as \"WandaVision,\" \"Loki\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" all pandemic hits. </p><p>   Putting \"Black Widow\" on Disney+ conflicted with Mr. Feige's tiered approach -- creating TV shows that complement movies on the big screen. He resisted plans for the movie's simultaneous release, in part because he didn't like the idea of having one of Marvel's few female-driven movies demoted to the at-home streaming service, said people familiar with his thinking. </p><p>   Yet there was no easy solution at hand. Further delays would slow Marvel's subsequent movies and TV shows. </p><p>   Disney last month sought to move the dispute into confidential arbitration, which the company believes the contract calls for. No ruling has been issued. </p><p>   Ms. Johansson, meanwhile, is in Europe shooting a Wes Anderson film she agreed to make long before the \"Black Widow\" dispute. </p><p>   It will be released by Fox Searchlight, a division of Disney. </p><p></p>",
