  "text": "<p>   ABC News President Kim Godwin told staffers on a conference call Thursday that she has requested an independent investigation into how the network handled allegations of sexual assault against the former executive producer of \"Good Morning America.\" </p><p>   The comments came a day after a lawsuit was filed that alleged the producer, Michael Corn, sexually assaulted a current ABC News staffer and a former staffer in separate incidents. Mr. Corn denied wrongdoing and called the allegations fabrications. In response to a request for comment Thursday on the call for an ABC probe, a lawyer for Mr. Corn referred to his previous statement. </p><p>   \"We can't have us investigating us. We need an independent person,\" Ms. Godwin said, according to a recording of the conference call. \"The process has to be independent.\" </p><p>   The lawsuit also named Walt Disney Co.'s ABC as a defendant, saying the company didn't adequately respond to complaints of alleged misconduct by Mr. Corn from several women. </p><p>   On the call, Ms. Godwin said the ABC News staffers who were involved in handling complaints against Mr. Corn would get due process, but their role would be probed. </p><p>   Ms. Godwin joined ABC News in May from CBS News and wasn't there when Mr. Corn departed in mid-April. She told staffers she isn't going to be \"sweeping this under the rug.\" She said she has heard from enough people over the past day \"to know we have a problem.\" </p><p>   An ABC News spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   In a statement Wednesday, an ABC spokeswoman said: \"We are committed to upholding a safe and supportive work environment and have a process in place that thoroughly reviews and addresses complaints that are made. ABC News disputes the claims made against it and will address this matter in court.\" </p><p>   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court, Kirstyn Crawford, a current ABC News staffer, accused Mr. Corn of sexually assaulting her on a reporting trip in 2015 in Los Angeles. The incidents took place in an Uber ride after a party and later at their hotel, she alleged. </p><p>   The suit also alleges that former ABC News producer Jill McClain was sexually assaulted by Mr. Corn when the two worked at ABC's \"World News Tonight\" roughly a decade ago. Ms. McClain isn't a plaintiff in the suit but is supporting Ms. Crawford's case, according to the complaint. </p><p>   In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Corn cited emails Ms. Crawford sent to him the morning after the alleged incident, in which she engages in friendly banter, saying they prove that the alleged encounter didn't occur. </p><p>   Similarly, he said Ms. McClain invited him to her wedding and conveyed that she missed him after leaving ABC. \"These are not the words and actions of a woman who had been assaulted,\" Mr. Corn said in the statement in reference to both women. </p><p>   Several ABC officials learned of Ms. Crawford's allegations in 2017, including company lawyer Tanya Menton, publicist Heather Riley and business executive Derek Medina, according to the suit. An investigation into Mr. Corn's conduct was launched only after Ms. Crawford and Ms. McClain filed formal complaints to the company in February of this year, according to the suit. </p><p>   On the call, Ms. Godwin said \"the truth has to come out\" and that the ABC employees named in the suit shouldn't be involved in a review of the company's handling of the allegations. </p><p>   Mr. Medina, Ms. Menton and Ms. Riley didn't respond to requests for comment Thursday. </p><p>   When Mr. Corn left ABC News, neither he nor the company gave a reason for his departure. Asked if ABC News should be more transparent when an executive leaves, Ms. Godwin said, \"There is a lot we have to fix,\" acknowledging she didn't know what happened in this instance. </p><p>   \"If people don't know what's going on, is that the right message?\" Ms. Godwin said. She added that sometimes there are legal reasons that limit disclosure. </p><p>   Ms. Godwin said she would stand up for the staff about their concerns with higher management. \"I can't snap my fingers and change anything, but I can speak truth to power. I need to know truth,\" she said. </p><p>   She said she understood the anger among the staff about the allegations in the suit and described the news unit as a \"house on fire.\" </p><p>   \"There is a lot of pain . . . I want people to feel heard,\" she said. </p><p>   \"The buck stops here with me. If you don't trust anybody, give me a shot,\" Ms. Godwin said. </p><p></p>",
