  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA finished 333.83 points, or 1%, higher at 33,160.83.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX advanced 21.31 points, or 0.6%, to close at 3,828.11.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 51.68 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 10,616.20.</p><p>All three indexes are starting the week off strong, with the Dow having risen 424 points, or 1.3%, on Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 had gained 1% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9%.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>All three benchmarks extended their winning streak on Tuesday, however for a brief moment in early afternoon trading, it appeared as if a spate of troubling news might upset the apple cart.</p><p>Briefly, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dipped into the red as jitters about the Binance-FTX deal started to spread beyond the cryptocurrency market and undercut stocks as well.</p><p>\"The whole thing seems like a giant disaster and it's one thing after another in the crypto industry,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, during a phone call with MarketWatch. He said that traders had been becoming increasingly concerned about the deal since it was abruptly announced by the heads of the two respective firms on Twitter Tuesday.</p><p>The news helped send bitcoin BTCUSD prices falling more than 10% to $18,250 per coin, and it briefly weighed on risk assets more broadly.</p><p>See: \"People have legitimate reason to worry:\" Crypto industry insiders react to Binance's intent to acquire FTX</p><p>\"The crypto meltdown right now tends to work as a negative for the risk-on environment,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.Riley Wealth, during a call with MarketWatch.</p><p>Despite the brief hiccup, stocks managed to power higher as investors continued to expect that the Republicans will retake the U.S. House in Tuesday's midterm elections, ushering in a return to partisan gridlock in Washington, which Wall Street expects will be beneficial for equity valuations since it may mean less spending, which should help undercut inflation.</p><p>\"The rationale is pretty straightforward. Gridlock cross-checks each party's 'worst impulses', and less activist fiscal policy is conducive to lower market volatility,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>While the Binance-FTX news and the U.S. midterm vote consumed investors' attention on Tuesday, many investors see Thursday's consumer price index, or CPI, reading, as the main event for markets this week, given the critical role that inflation is playing in determining the path of Fed policy.</p><p>While many expect the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in December, investors are also waiting to see how Thursday's October inflation report pans out.</p><p>A high CPI reading could see expectations for another supersize rate hike increase be put back on the table, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.</p><p>Despite the S&amp;P 500 having bounced 6.4% from its 2022 closing low in mid October, some analysts warned that the bear market downtrend remains intact.</p><p>\"The [S&amp;P 500's] spike back above 3800 might have seemed positive to many investors after SPX successfully held 3700 last week, but technically last week's deterioration remains a larger technical concern heading into mid-term Elections and CPI data,\" wrote Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.</p><p>\"Downside risk levels are very well defined at 3700, and any break of this level turns the near-term quite bearish which could bring about a quick retest of October lows. Bottom line, market indices remain in a key window of volatility, and it's essential for the Bulls that Technology starts to stabilize quickly along with rates showing more weakness,\" Newton added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the third-quarter U.S. corporate earnings reporting season rumbles on, with Walt Disney Co. DIS the highlight on Tuesday as it's expected to report after the close of trade.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Lyft Inc. LYFT shares fell more than 20% after ride-hailing company postedmixed third-quarter results Monday afternoon that showed underwhelming customer numbers even as Lyft benefitted from pricing trends.</p><p>* Shares of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. TTWO dropped more than 12% after the videogame publisher cut its bookings outlook for the year by $400 million because of pipeline \"shifts,\" and weaker-than-expected mobile and in-game spending.</p><p>* Coinbase Global Inc. COIN tumbled more than 10% as shares of the crypto exchange tumbled</p><p>U.S. stocks clinch 3rd day of gains as investors await midterm election results, inflation report</p>",
