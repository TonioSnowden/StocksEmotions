  "text": "<p>The English Premier League is closing in on the sale of its US television rights for a new record, defying fears that the pandemic might dent the appeal of top flight football to broadcasters.</p> <p>ViacomCBS and Disney's ESPN are among those vying for the rights with Comcast's NBC, the current holders who acquired them for roughly $1bn in 2015. Second-round bids are due by November 18.</p> <p>People familiar with the sale said the Premier League is on course to sell the rights for about $2bn, exceeding the expectations among club executives.</p> <p>As well as a new record for the US market, where the Premier League has sold broadcast rights since the early 90s, it would mark the competition's most lucrative overseas television deal. The league is selling all 38 matches in a single block rather than in separate packages in a deal that will run from the 2022-23 season to 2027-28.</p> <p>An increase in the value of its US deal would contrast with the renewal in May of the league's domestic TV rights, where Sky, BT and Amazon agreed to roll over the existing £5bn agreement. </p> <p>Competition for the US rights underlines how the Premier League is breaking into America, where it has historically struggled for airtime in a market dominated by North American sports such as gridiron football, baseball and basketball. </p> <p>As the wider US television industry moves towards streaming on services like Netflix, cable networks are fighting for survival, making the most popular sports even more valuable as one of the few types of entertainment people want to watch live. </p> <p>Nearly 7m US households ditched their pay-TV subscriptions last year, according to eMarketer, a trend that is expected to continue. </p> <p>“The number one most viewed thing [on television] every year tends to be sports”, Disney chief executive Bob Chapek told a conference in September. Disney's ESPN channels make nearly $10 per subscriber in monthly fees paid by cable providers, four times more than any other cable channel. </p> <p>ViacomCBS, ESPN, NBC and the Premier League declined to comment.</p> <p>Individual Premier League matches can now attract in excess of 1m viewers in the US, such as Manchester City's 4-1 away win against Liverpool in February. The expected uplift in the value of the rights will also be a boon to English football clubs, which lost roughly £2bn of broadcast and match-day revenues during the two seasons disrupted by the pandemic. </p> <p>In recent months, a range of US broadcasters have struck new deals for international football broadcasts. In May, ESPN <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a53e83ef-9088-4130-8918-a9eb5b9f3a52\">acquired the rights</a> to screen Spanish La Liga matches in the US in a contract worth $1.4bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>CBS, for its part, has been amassing a portfolio of football programming over the past 18 months, including broadcast rights to the Uefa Champions League, US National Women's Soccer League, Italy's Serie A, and most recently the FA's Women's Super League.</p> <p>NBC has held the US rights to the Premier League since 2013, ratings for which dipped slightly last season amid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d52110ab-a97f-4a57-8782-a560baa7151e\">widespread disruption</a> to broadcast schedules across sport. Premier League matches aired on the flagship NBC network, excluding streaming and sister channels, averaged 879,000 viewers during the 2020-2021 season, up 2 per cent over the prior year according to Comcast.</p><p>Source: Samuel Agini in London, Sara Germano and Anna Nicolaou in New York 2021 'Premier League closes in on record sale of US TV rights' FT.com 15 November.
