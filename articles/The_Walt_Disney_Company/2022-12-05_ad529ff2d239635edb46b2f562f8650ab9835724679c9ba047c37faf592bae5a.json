Join the conversation below.</p><p>To make the list, Nielsen measured the number of minutes people spent watching shows from major streaming services: Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu and Netflix. The results reflect viewership between Jan. 1 and July 1, the latest available. Nielsen uses measurement devices as well as panels and surveys of real people to determine viewership across all platforms.</p><p>Fantasy movies and series released in the second half of the year will likely reshape the Top 10, says Brian Fuhrer, senior vice president of product strategy at Nielsen. \"Hocus Pocus\" and \"Hocus Pocus 2,\" the sequel released in September, broke the company's record for streaming, with 2.7 billion viewing minutes in a single week. \"The Rings of Power\" and \"House of the Dragon\" might also bump some crime programming out of the Top 10.</p><p>July marked a turning point in TV viewing habits. For the first time, usage of streaming services surpassed that of both broadcast and cable TV. Streaming represented a record 34.8% share of total television consumption, while cable and broadcast came in at 34.4% and 21.6%, respectively, Nielsen found.</p><p>One reason is that streaming services bumped up their offerings in the summer, when broadcast and cable channels typically experience a lull, Mr. Fuhrer says.</p><p>The number of shows available to watch across all platforms is also increasing. In February, Gracenote, a Nielsen company, listed more than 817,000 unique program titles across traditional TV and streaming services. In December 2019, there were just over 646,000 unique program titles.</p><p>However, more shows may lead to more confusion, especially as streaming services beef up their libraries. In a Nielsen survey of adults who use streaming services, 46% said it's harder to find something to watch because there are too many streaming services available.</p><p>Ms. DeCarbo, a writer in South Carolina, can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p><p>What TV Shows Did We Watch in 2022?
