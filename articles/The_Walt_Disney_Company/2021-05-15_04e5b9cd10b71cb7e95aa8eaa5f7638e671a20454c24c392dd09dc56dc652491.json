  "title": "Business Shifts Stance On Mask Rules --- Walmart to no longer require coverings as other industries weigh response to guidelines",
  "text": "<p>That made Walmart an early mover in response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new recommendations. Costco Wholesale Corp. made a similar shift. Executives in sectors ranging from autos to grocers said they were wrestling with how to respond to the new guidelines, which they note conflicts in many cases with state, local and other protocols specific to certain industries. While a number of states including Virginia and Pennsylvania moved immediately to lift their mask guidance, leaders in a handful including California, New York and New Jersey said they were reviewing policies.</p><p>Car makers General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. said they are sticking with existing policies while awaiting guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has jurisdiction over their workplaces and still requires face coverings and social distancing. The agency didn't update its guidance based on the CDC announcement, and OSHA representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Some national retailers said they were reviewing the CDC's changes. Kroger Co., the nation's biggest supermarket chain, said it would continue requiring masks and encouraging social distancing. The company said it is asking employees for feedback as it reviews safety practices and the latest CDC guidance.</p><p>Another grocer, Trader Joe's, said it would drop its mask requirements for vaccinated customers. \"We encourage customers to follow the guidance of health officials,\" the company posted on Twitter. It won't require proof of vaccination for those who forgo masks, a spokesperson said.</p><p>The CDC said Thursday that fully vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask or physically distance during outdoor or indoor activities, large or small, in most settings. The agency said it made the revisions based on science indicating that being fully vaccinated cuts the risk of getting infected and spreading the virus to others, in addition to preventing severe disease and death.</p><p>The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group, said the CDC's mask announcement creates ambiguity since it doesn't align with state and local orders. The group asked customers who decline to wear masks to shop online or use curbside pickup.</p><p>\"Retailers will continue to prioritize the safety of their team members first,\" said Lisa LaBruno, a senior vice president at the group.</p><p>At Walmart, to go maskless, workers have to say they are vaccinated during the health screenings each worker takes to start a shift, the company said. The retailer continues to review whether masks should be worn for certain jobs, said a companywide email Friday, and workers can continue to wear masks if they want to.</p><p>Walmart won't ask shoppers to offer proof that they have been vaccinated, instead relying on customers' word, a spokesman said.</p><p>At Costco, vaccinated shoppers and workers will no longer need to wear masks, though it recommends employees continue to do so, said chief financial officer Richard Galanti Friday. Workers will need to sign a \"mask opt out\" form verifying they are vaccinated, he said, while it won't verify shoppers are vaccinated.</p><p>The relaxed mandate could allow bigger crowds to gather. Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Chapek said he expects to see an immediate increase in the number of people allowed inside domestic theme parks following the CDC move. \"Today's guidance,\" he said Thursday, \"is very big news for us.\"</p><p>Food makers Conagra Brands Inc., General Mills Inc. and Kellogg Co. said they are continuing to require masks and social distancing at their factories even as employees get vaccinated, as food manufacturers have to follow a range of industry-specific regulations.</p><p>The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food and other grocery manufacturers, said it has asked the CDC for more details on how its latest mask guidance affects businesses such as factories.</p><p>Betsy Booren, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for the group, said the revised guidance seemed directed mainly at consumers in their daily lives but that food factories, where workers are often crowded together, present different circumstances.</p><p>While restaurants want to return to normal so they can get more business, they also want diners to feel safe enough to return, said the National Restaurant Association, which has decided not to update its masking guidance immediately.</p><p>Paul Mangiamele, chief executive of Legendary Brands LLC, a Dallas company whose franchisees include roughly 80 Bennigan's pubs and Steak and Ale restaurants in the U.S., said he expects most of his franchisees to remove masking restrictions in the coming days. But the company will let individual restaurants decide how to verify vaccination status.</p><p>In Philadelphia, McGillan's Olde Ale House, a 150-year-old Irish pub near the city's downtown, is operating at 50% capacity and requiring masks and social distancing for all patrons and employees, except while eating and drinking. Owner Chris Mullins is waiting for the city's guidance before lifting the pub's mask requirement. Local health officials have said they hope to remove all capacity and distancing precautions by June 11.</p><p>\"Everyone's excited, and they want the extra money and the increased business,\" Mr. Mullins said. \"But the potential for every night being New Year's Eve, with five deep at the bar and people screaming in your face for a beer, is still a little jarring to some of my employees, too.\"</p><p>Small businesses aren't certain how to respond to the new mask guidance, said Kevin Kuhlman, head of government relations for the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Many small businesses hope state and local governments endorse the CDC's view. Were OSHA to issue any new emergency guidelines that conflict with CDC advice, \"that would really confuse small businesses,\" Mr. Kuhlman said.</p><p>States, meanwhile, were retailoring their requirements.</p><p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Friday that the state would lift most mask requirements, social distancing and capacity and gathering limits, both indoors and outdoors.</p><p>\"This is a big step forward in living our lives the way they were before the pandemic,\" said Mr. Cooper, a Democrat.</p><p>New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday \"we're not there yet\" with regards to loosening masking requirements indoors at businesses or other public settings. New York and New Jersey are set to remove most economic restrictions Wednesday.</p><p>---</p><p>Christina Rogers, Jaewon Kang, Melanie Grayce West, Annie Gasparro and Craig Karmin contributed to this article.</p>",
