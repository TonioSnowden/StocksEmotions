  "title": "'Fight Club' No Longer Ends With a Whimper in China Following Explosion Over Censorship; Chinese video platform quietly restores 1999 cult film's conclusion, but 2005's 'Lord of War' still comes with new, harmonious ending",
  "text": "<p>Gone is a note at the end that says police prevented the explosions and sent Mr. Norton's character to an asylum.</p><p>The change, which users first noticed late last week, comes after Tencent sparked a wave of global ridicule by uploading the censored version of \"Fight Club\" to its streaming platform in January. Tencent didn't explain the new ending at the time, nor has it said why it restored the original one.</p><p>The company declined to comment.</p><p>Censorship has grown stricter—but also more opaque and less predictable—under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. For many among the country's legions of cinephiles, Tencent's response to the furor over \"Fight Club\" only muddies the waters more.</p><p>\"You never know where the red line lies,\" wrote one user of the popular Twitter-like Weibo platform after the film's original ending was restored.</p><p>For decades, Chinese censors have demanded that scenes deemed sensitive or vulgar be cut from officially imported foreign films and TV shows. In one famous example, 2007's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" appeared in mainland theaters missing roughly half of the scenes involving a villain played by Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat after censors decided they made Chinese people look bad.</p><p>Chinese authorities have, on rare occasions, required elements to be added to films as a means of censorship. Such was the case with the 2018 romantic fantasy \"The Shape of Water,\" in which a dark swimsuit was added to cover the naked body of the protagonist in a shower scene with her amphibian lover.</p><p>But it is unusual for films to be augmented in a way that completely alters their endings. And in the case of \"Fight Club,\" a movie considered part of the antiestablishment canon that had long been widely available to Chinese viewers through black market DVDs, the inserting of a pro-establishment conclusion sparked an explosion of mockery both inside and outside of the country.</p><p>On Zhihu, a Quora-like site, users responded by suggesting mock alternate endings for other films. One user imagined a new ending for the prison-escape drama \"Shawshank Redemption\" in which Andy Dufresne, the wrongfully convicted main character, is rearrested by police and sentenced to additional prison time because \"the right thing cannot be done in the wrong way.\"</p><p>In a recent episode, CBS's \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" responded to the \"Fight Club\" alteration with its own set of new endings, including a version of 1977's original \"Star Wars\" film in which the evil Empire rebuilds the Death Star and imprisons the rebels.</p><p>Chinese regulations on censorship require that films avoid \"confusing justice with injustice\" and ban plots that \"tout arrogance for criminals.\" To ensure access to mainland China's lucrative market, filmmakers in Hong Kong have long been known to make two versions of crime movies, one for mainland audiences that ends in victory for the police and another with the opposite result for the rest of the world.</p><p>China's regulators in charge of film and the internet didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. It couldn't be determined who was responsible for the altered ending of \"Fight Club\" that appeared on Tencent.</p><p>Last year, the platform also uploaded a new version of 2005's \"Lord of War,\" in which the main character, a criminal arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage, confesses and is sentenced to life in prison rather than being set free with help from the U.S. government, as happens in the original.</p><p>The \"Lord of War\" alternate ending, also described in a written note, remains on Tencent's platform. The current version of \"Fight Club,\" despite having its ending restored, is still missing several scenes involving nudity.</p><p>Other foreign films with similar themes have likewise encountered barriers in China. \"V for Vendetta,\" the 2005 dystopian action film that helped popularize the Guy Fawkes mask as an antiestablishment emblem, was erased from China's most popular movie database in 2020 despite already being well-known to local audiences.</p><p>\"Joker,\" the 2019 thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix, never showed in Chinese theaters despite being one of that year's highest grossing films—a snub that many expectant Chinese moviegoers speculated may have been related to its anarchic theme.</p><p>Chuck Palahniuk, the writer whose novel inspired the \"Fight Club\" film, responded to news of the altered ending with a post on Twitter late last month: \"This is SUPER wonderful! Everyone gets a happy ending in China!\"</p><p>In an interview with the entertainment website TMZ, Mr. Palahniuk said he found the grumbling among Americans ironic, noting that several of his books have been banned outright in some U.S. schools. He added that the new Chinese ending more closely mirrored his book, which ends with the bombs failing to explode and the protagonist waking up in a mental hospital. He said publishers overseas have altered the ending of his book to make it more like the movie.</p><p>Some Chinese social media users have seized on the author's comments in arguing the censorship was justified. More viewers have ridiculed the decision, with some questioning why a film that stands as a critique of American capitalism would need to be altered.</p><p>Several Weibo users borrowed a phrase from Mr. Xi in mocking the \"Fight Club\" episode, saying it demonstrated \"the confidence of our culture.\"</p><p>Reddy Zhao contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Wenxin Fan at Wenxin.Fan@wsj.com</p><p>'Fight Club' No Longer Ends With a Whimper in China Following Explosion Over Censorship</p>",
