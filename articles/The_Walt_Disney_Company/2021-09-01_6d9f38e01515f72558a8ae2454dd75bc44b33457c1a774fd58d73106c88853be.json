  "text": "<p>(Hulu)</p><p>A man is found dead at an apartment building in Manhattan. Three strangers bound by a love of true-crime podcasts and apartments at the Arconia, aren't satisfied when the death is ruled a suicide. They come together not just to solve the crime, but also to create a podcast about their efforts.</p><p>This is the premise of the new series \"Only Murders in the Building,\" which premiered its first three episodes on Hulu this week and drops new episodes on Tuesdays through Oct. 19. Steve Martin plays Charles, an actor whose best days are behind him. Martin Short is Oliver, a Broadway director whose bills have caught up with him. And Selena Gomez is Mabel, a mysterious resident of the expensive building who is a generation and a half younger than her two neighbors.</p><p>John Hoffman co-created the series with Mr. Martin. He said that when the comic legend approached him about the project, Mr. Martin told him that if the series got subsequent seasons, \"it could be the new 'Murder, She Wrote.'\" That would, of course, turn the Arconia into the Cabot Cove of Manhattan.</p><p>\"The repercussions of what that means for a particular building in New York,\" says Mr. Hoffman, \"certainly is on my mind if we get to go forward.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Q-Force'</p><p>(Netflix)</p><p>With the new animated action comedy \"Q-Force,\" \"Will &amp; Grace\" star Sean Hayes has helped build a home for a gay James Bond.</p><p>\"I was driving around thinking: if Mike Myers is Austin Powers, if Melissa McCarthy is [Susan Cooper in] 'Spy' … then what is my version of that? What is the gay version? Why don't we do a gay James Bond movie?,\" says Mr. Hayes.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Instead of a movie, Mr. Hayes and his collaborators have made a series about Steve Maryweather, a U.S. spy whose career has stalled and who has corralled a group of LGBTQ operatives who are derisively known as the Q-Force—short for Queer Force—a tag they eventually embrace. Not given the chance to show what they can do—and repeatedly told to just be patient—they go rogue to prove themselves.</p><p>Mr. Hayes voices Maryweather and is an executive producer on the series, which was created by Gabe Liedman. He says he can relate to the idea of being told to \"just be patient,\" something he heard as a young actor in Hollywood.</p><p>\"I found that that doesn't work for me. And it didn't work for Steve Maryweather and Q-Force either, because there's no ticking clock on 'just be patient,'\" he says. \"I do implement the 'let's not wait and see' attitude. Let's just do.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Cinderella'</p><p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>In Prime Video's new \"Cinderella,\" Pierce Brosnan is a king shopping for a princess for his son, Idina Menzel is a widow with a stepdaughter in the basement, and Camila Cabello is Ella, an orphan who dreams of being a dressmaker.</p><p>The musical update of the classic story is set to the tune of hits such as Janet Jackson's \"Rhythm Nation,\" Des'ree's \"You Gotta Be,\" and Madonna's \"Material Girl.\" There are also original songs. Ms. Cabello, performer of global hits like \"Señorita,\" sings \"Million to One.\" Ms. Menzel, who will forever be known for her \"Frozen\" franchise power ballads \"Let It Go\" and \"Into the Unknown,\" sings \"Dream Girl.\" The movie begins streaming Friday.</p><p>Writer and director Kay Cannon says she saw the movie as an opportunity to bring classic hits to a new audience and to do \"all the things I'd want to do with that iconic yet antiquated notion of a fairy tale.\"</p><p>\"We all know the 'Cinderella' story, but we don't know the Ella story,\" she says. \"And her name is Ella. It is not Cinderella. Cinderella is a mean name that she's been called by her step family. But that's not who she is. She is a human being who has a right to follow her dreams in a time when you're not able to.\"</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>—Back to Billions: \"Billions,\" Showtime's Wall Street saga starring Paul Giamatti, Damian Lewis and Maggie Siff, picks season five back up on Sunday after being sidelined by the pandemic.</p><p>—Summer's Over: The schoolhouse, ensemble comedy \"A.P.
