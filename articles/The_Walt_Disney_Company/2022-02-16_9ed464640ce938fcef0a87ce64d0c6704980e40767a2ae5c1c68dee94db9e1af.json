  "title": "The end of the pandemic may be in sight, says Moderna CEO",
  "text": "<p>That was Moderna's MRNA chief executive officer Stephane Bancel, responding to a question about whether the world could be entering the last stages of the global coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>There is an “80% chance that as omicron evolves or SarsCov-2&#xa0;virus evolves,&#xa0;we are going to see less and less virulent viruses,” Bancel told CNBC in an interview that published Wednesday. But he cautioned that there's still a 20% chance of another scenario emerging involving a mutation “more virulant than omicron”.</p><p>The assessment on where we are in the pandemic from the chief of the COVID-19 vaccine maker comes as cases have continued falling in recent weeks across the U.S. and other countries, and pandemic restrictions ease.</p><p>Retailing giants Walmart&#xa0;WMT and Amazon&#xa0;AMZN have dropped mask requirements for fully vaccinated workers, tech companies such as Microsoft&#xa0;MSFTand Facebook FB are setting office return dates for employees, and even Disney World DIShas dropped mask requirements for vaccinated visitors.</p><p>President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that it was “probably premature” for states to drop their indoor face-mask requirements, and the Centers for Disease Control is sticking with its recommendation for protective face masks.</p><p>The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 stood at 922,473 on Tuesday, as the wave of cases caused by the highly infectious omicron variant continued to fall from January's peak. Still, COVID-19 infections through the fast-spreading omicron variant have been wreaking havoc in parts of Asia, South Korea and Hong Kong seeing record cases.</p><p>“I think we got lucky as a world that omicron was not very virulent, but still are we see thousands of people dying every day around the planet because of omicron,”&#xa0;said Bancel, who added that “this virus is going to stay with humans forever, like flu and we'd have to live with it.”</p><p>Moderna has clinical studies underway of a specific vaccine for the omicron variant, should it be needed, he said.</p>",
