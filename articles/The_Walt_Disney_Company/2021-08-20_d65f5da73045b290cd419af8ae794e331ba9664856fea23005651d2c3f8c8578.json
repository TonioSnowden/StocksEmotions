  "title": "Recently Named 'Jeopardy!' Host Mike Richards Steps Down; Resignation comes a week after he was named a successor to Alex Trebek, following concern over past comments, allegations of gender bias and perceived conflict of interest",
  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, however, the Ringer reported on crass remarks and jokes Mr. Richards had made on a podcast of his about eight years ago. That resulted in outcry, especially from \"Jeopardy!\" fans and former contestants who view the show as a bastion of egalitarian intelligence. The public response convinced Sony that it would be impossible for Mr. Richards to continue as host, and prompted his decision to exit that role, according to a person familiar with the situation.</p><p>Now production has halted on \"Jeopardy!\", one of the most valuable properties in television, as Sony lines up one or more stand-ins, and plunges back into the process of hiring a permanent host. Meanwhile, Mr. Richards remains on the \"Jeopardy!\" staff as executive producer, raising questions about why he was allowed to keep that job, and how he would interact with the host who eventually replaces him.</p><p>Sony defended the decision and drew a distinction between the role Mr. Richards would have played as the face of the show and the role he will continue behind the scenes. \"Mike has been with us for the last two years and has led the Jeopardy! team through the most challenging time the show has ever experienced,\" the company said in a statement. \"It is our hope that as EP he will continue to do so with professionalism and respect.\" Mr. Richards also serves as executive producer of \"Wheel of Fortune.\"</p><p>Companies are increasingly contending with how to respond to pressure from fans, social media and staff when executives and talent come under fire for past comments. This year Condé Nast let go of a recently named editor in chief for Teen Vogue over past racist and antigay social-media posts; Apple Inc. parted ways with a prominent advertising-technology engineer over sexist passages in a memoir; and Walt Disney Co. dropped \"The Mandalorian\" actress Gina Carano for social-media posts that upset fans.</p><p>\"Over the last several days it has become clear that moving forward as host would be too much of a distraction for our fans and not the right move for the show,\" Mr. Richards wrote in a memo to staff, which was released by Sony. \"As such, I will be stepping down as host effective immediately.\"</p><p>He wrote: \"I want to apologize to each of you for the unwanted negative attention that has come to Jeopardy! over the last few weeks and for the confusion and delays this is now causing. I know I have a lot of work to do to regain your trust and confidence.\"</p><p>Mayim Bialik, the actress Sony hired at the same time as Mr. Richards to host the game show's prime-time specials and spinoffs, will remain in that role. A representative for Ms. Bialik didn't respond to a request for comment</p><p>\"Jeopardy!\" audiences will get a brief glimpse of Mr. Richards helming the show. The five episodes he taped Thursday—his first and last day in the role of full-time host—will air as scheduled in September, according to a person familiar with the situation, who added that guest hosts who appeared on the show in previous months are likely to return to the lectern.</p><p>Mr. Richards's resignation as host marks the latest and biggest debacle for the sedate game show, which had operated smoothly for more than three decades with Mr. Trebek. Though its viewership has eroded since the death of Mr. Trebek last year, \"Jeopardy!\" remains one of the most popular shows in syndicated television, with an average of 8.8 million total viewers. Roughly 38% of \"Jeopardy!\" viewers watched at least three times a week this season, making it the most loyal audience among all syndicated TV series, according to distributor CBS Media Ventures.</p><p>A public audition process featuring a rotation of 14 guest hosts, including Mr. Richards and Ms. Bialik, divided fans and sparked debate about the identity of the show.</p><p>When Mr. Richards first emerged as a front-runner to be full-time host, many of the show's core fans and even former contestants reacted with surprise and protest. They complained that as an insider and a participant in the hiring search, the producer seemed to have an unfair advantage and hadn't been transparent about his pursuit of the job. At the same time, news reports resurfaced about lawsuits Mr. Richards was involved in when he was an executive producer of \"The Price Is Right.\" One suit, filed by a former model on the game show, included allegations that Mr. Richards discriminated against her after she became pregnant. The lawsuit was settled.</p><p>The Ringer article dissected a podcast he had co-hosted called \"The Randumb Show.\" On the podcast, Mr. Richards made disparaging remarks about women, used a Jewish stereotype and used derogatory terms for little people and the mentally disabled, according to the article.</p><p>On Thursday, the Anti-Defamation League posted a statement on Twitter criticizing Mr. Richards as using language on the podcast that the ADL described as bigoted. \"New \"Jeopardy!\" host Mike Richards' disparaging remarks about Jews, women &amp; Asians are no laughing matter,\" it wrote, adding, \"This reported pattern warrants an investigation.\"</p><p>Sony said it supported Mr. Richards's decision to step down as host, referring to \"offensive language he used in the past.\"</p><p>All episodes of the podcast were deleted from the free site that had hosted them. In Friday's memo to \"Jeopardy!\" staff about his resignation, Mr. Richards said, \"It pains me that past incidents and comments have cast such a shadow on Jeopardy! as we look to start a new chapter.\"</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>Recently Named 'Jeopardy!'
