  "text": "<p>In Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo's sweetly understated comedy-drama, a gaggle of teenage hoodlums do the things that teenage hoodlums do: hang out, get into fights, cheek their elders and engage in low-level criminal activity, all the while daydreaming about escaping to more glamorous parts.</p> <p>The series is set on a rural reservation in Oklahoma, and nearly everyone involved in the production, from the cast and crew to the writers' room, is Native American. <em>Reservation Dogs</em> therefore avoids falling into the usual patterns of marginalisation or romanticisation of indigenous communities — as Waititi (maker of <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> and <em>Jojo Rabbit</em>) has pointed out, no one converses with the wind and there is a notable absence of flute music. In a very Waititian sleight of weirdness, however, there is a spirit guide who neatly sends up western depictions of Native Americans, appearing to one of the kids who has been concussed in a fight and claiming he was crushed by his horse at Little Bighorn.</p> <p>In this hopeless town, the cards are stacked against our adolescent quartet — Bear (D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), Cheese (Lane Factor), Elora Danan Postoak (Devery Jacobs) and Willie Jack (Paulina Alexis) — although the darker elements of their lives, which includes the death of one of their number, are carried lightly. The nods to Tarantino are multiple, from the title to the suits worn by the kids while squaring up to some local thugs. Other films also make their presence felt, most deliciously during the slow-motion shooting of Bear by a rival gang with paint pellets against a histrionic soundtrack — a homage to the death of Sergeant Elias in <em>Platoon</em>. </p> <p>There are traces, too, of Waititi's own <em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em> from 2016, most noticeably in an episode in which Elora visits a reclusive cousin, famed for once punching out 20 men in a bar brawl, and in the awkward tenderness that develops between the gruff old man and the shrugging teen. Elsewhere, the series briefly veers into medical comedy territory as a long wait in an ER sees Cheese mistaken for an elderly patient's grandson. It's a measure of his basic decency that he decides to go with it.</p> <p>Despite this scattering of comic set pieces, there is a gratifying absence of polish to this coming-of-age series in which not all that much happens and the vibe is more <em>Shameless</em> than <em>Clueless</em>. There is no big narrative arc here: no mystery to be unravelled or emotional journey undertaken. It's just a bunch of bored teens counting the days until the future comes.</p> <p>★★★★★</p> <p><em>On Disney Plus in the UK and FX on Hulu in the US</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2021 'Reservation Dogs — series about indigenous youths holds the flute music' FT.com 15 November.
