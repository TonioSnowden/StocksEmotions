  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 514 points, or 1.6%, to 33,341.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 51 points, or 1.3%, at 3,857.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained 162 points, or 1.5%, to trade at 10,727.</p><p>All three indexes are starting the week off strong, with the Dow having risen 424 points, or 1.3%, on Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 had gained 1% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9%.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>After shrugging off early choppiness, stocks were on track to score a three-day winning streak. The S&amp;P 500's 2.3% gain over the previous couple of sessions was partly the result of buyers front-running a traditional \"buy signal\" event, the completion of the U.S. midterm elections, according to some analysts.</p><p>\"U.S. equities began the week bouncing back, with the S&amp;P 500 convincingly up ahead of the U.S. midterm elections on Tuesday, where a divided government in Washington is ostensibly bullish for equities,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>\"The rationale is pretty straightforward. Gridlock cross-checks each party's 'worst impulses', and less activist fiscal policy is conducive to lower market volatility,\" Innes added.</p><p>While the elections were the big news on Tuesday, many investors see Thursday's consumer price index, or CPI, reading, as the main event for markets this week, given inflation's importance in helping to determine the path of Federal Reserve policy.</p><p>While many expect the Federal Reserve to hike rates by 50 basis points in December, a hot CPI reading could see expectations for another supersize hike increase, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. But</p><p>Despite the S&amp;P 500 having bounced 6.4% from its 2022 closing low in mid October, some analysts warned that the bear market downtrend remains intact.</p><p>\"The [S&amp;P 500's] spike back above 3800 might have seemed positive to many investors after SPX successfully held 3700 last week, but technically last week's deterioration remains a larger technical concern heading into mid-term Elections and CPI data,\" wrote Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.</p><p>\"Downside risk levels are very well defined at 3700, and any break of this level turns the near-term quite bearish which could bring about a quick retest of October lows. Bottom line, market indices remain in a key window of volatility, and it's essential for the Bulls that Technology starts to stabilize quickly along with rates showing more weakness,\" Newton added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the third-quarter U.S. corporate earnings reporting season rumbles on, with Walt Disney Co. DIS the highlight on Tuesday as it's expected to report after the close of trade.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Lyft Inc. LYFT shares fell 20.7% after ride-hailing company postedmixed third-quarter results Monday afternoon that showed underwhelming customer numbers even as Lyft benefitted from pricing trends.</p><p>* Shares of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. TTWO dropped 12.7% after the videogame publisher cut its bookings outlook for the year by $400 million because of pipeline \"shifts,\" and weaker-than-expected mobile and in-game spending.</p><p>Dow climbs 500 points as U.S. stocks attempt 3-day winning streak with midterms under way</p>",
