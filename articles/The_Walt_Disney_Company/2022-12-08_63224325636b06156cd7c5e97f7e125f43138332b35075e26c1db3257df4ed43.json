  "title": "Disney+ With Ads Goes Live; The overhaul comes after a slowdown in subscriber growth for streaming services",
  "text": "<p>The rollout of the ad-supported Disney+ follows a few tumultuous weeks for the media giant. Disney last month announced companywide cost-cutting measures and told division leaders that layoffs were likely. The board then ousted Bob Chapek as chief executive and brought back Robert Iger, the company's former chairman and CEO who had previously left at the end of last year. </p><p>Mr. Iger told employees in a companywide town-hall meeting last month that he will emphasize profitability over growing subscriber numbers at the company's streaming service.</p><p>Investors and analysts expect ads and higher subscription costs will produce higher profits for the company's streaming segment, but note that price increases could raise the streaming platform's churn rate, or the percentage of subscribers who cancel the service each month.</p><p>Many streaming services across the media industry have struggled of late attracting new subscribers. Growth in the number of subscribers year-over-year has slowed or stayed flat for at least the past three consecutive quarters for several streaming services, including Netflix Inc., Paramount's Paramount+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Showtime.</p><p>Disney+ added 12.1 million new subscribers in the three months ended Oct. 1, but quarterly losses at the company's streaming business more than doubled from the previous year.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. said this week it will bring HBO Max back to Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video Channels platform., reversing an earlier decision made by HBO's previous owner to cut its reliance on third-party platforms for subscribers. HBO Max will be offered on the Prime Video Channels platform for $14.99 a month.</p><p>The pact will also extend to a revamped streaming service that Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to launch next year that will comprise both HBO and Discovery content.</p><p>For Disney, the new ad-supported subscription offerings also mark a reversal from how the company previously viewed that strategy. The company previously didn't want to include ads in Disney+, saying it would hurt consumers' experience. Then the company announced in March it would offer a new ad-supported version of Disney+.</p><p>Disney+ will carry about four minutes of commercials an hour on the ad-supported version of the platform. The planned four-minute-an-hour ad load is less than that of most streaming competitors and less than traditional TV offers, company officials have said.</p><p>A package of Hulu and Disney+ with ads will cost $9.99 a month. Disney also will offer an ad-supported bundle of Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu for $12.99. Viewers can also purchase an ad-supported package of Hulu with live television, Disney+ and ESPN+ for $69.99 a month.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Disney+ With Ads Goes Live</p>",
