  "text": "<p>\n  Peter Altmaier is Germany's economy minister. A Page One article on Wednesday about Intel Corp.'s plans to build new chip-making facilities in Europe incorrectly referred to Mr. Altmaier as finance minister. </p><p>\n  (See: \"Intel Tabs $95 Billion For New Chip Plants\" -- WSJ Sept. 8, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n   An Aug. 26 attack at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members, including one each from the Army and Navy.

The prosecutor's office in Cherokee County has said that the federal, state and local investigation didn't find evidence of prejudice against Asians. The case was cited in an Aug. 31 U.S. News article about an increase in hate crimes, but the article didn't make clear that prosecutors are divided over whether to pursue the cases as hate crimes. </p><p>\n  (See: \"U.S. News: Hate Crimes Increased 6% Last Year\" -- WSJ Aug. 31, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n   Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said seven Black men, known as the \"Martinsville Seven,\" in 1951 received racially biased death sentences not similarly applied to white defendants convicted of rape. A Sept. 1 U.S. Watch article about posthumous pardons for the men wasn't clear when it said the executions were racially biased due to how the death sentence was used in cases involving white defendants. </p><p>\n  (See: \"U.S. News: U.S. Watch\" -- WSJ Sept. 1, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Deutsche Telekom AG's name was misspelled as Deutsche Telecom in some editions Wednesday in a headline with a Business &amp; Finance article about its stake in T-Mobile. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Fidelity International was granted preliminary approval last month for its mutual-fund operations in China. In some editions Wednesday, a Business &amp; Finance article about BlackRock Inc. incorrectly said Fidelity Investments. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Walt Disney Co.'s Searchlight Pictures division has no current plans to distribute a new Wes Anderson film that is shooting in Europe and is starring Scarlett Johansson. An Exchange article on Saturday about Disney's salary negotiations with Ms. Johansson said the division will release the film. Separately, the article incorrectly called the division Fox Searchlight, its previous name. </p><p>\n  (See: \"EXCHANGE --- Scarlett Johansson Storms The Magic Kingdom --- How Disney's salary negotiations with the star of 'Black Widow' unraveled -- and turned into Hollywood's biggest star-vs.-studio battle in decades\" -- WSJ Sept. 4, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n   Serena Williams's last name was misspelled as Wiliams in one reference in a Sports article on Tuesday about tennis player Leylah Fernandez. </p><p>\n  (See: \"Sports: Canada's Breakout U.S. Open Star\" -- WSJ Sept. 7, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n   The weekly estimate for the price-to-earnings ratio of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 19.24.

These funds are different from lifestyle funds, which generally don't change their asset allocations over time in a predetermined way. The glossary in an Investing in Funds &amp; ETFs article on Tuesday about target-date funds incorrectly used the lifestyle-fund definition for the life-cycle funds. </p><p>\n  (See: \"Investing in Funds &amp; ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Need to Know: What You Should Know About . . . Target-Date Funds\" -- WSJ Sept. 7, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n   A Mansion article on Friday about converting B&amp;Bs into single-family homes contained a photo of a home that was incorrectly identified as the Bed &amp; Breakfast on Tiffany Hill. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Notice to readers </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Wall Street Journal staff members are working remotely during the pandemic.
