  "title": "Disney Details Plans for Cost Cuts, Layoffs and Hiring Freeze in Memo; Plans include a review of spending at all divisions and follows large losses in its streaming business",
  "text": "<p>In the memo, which was addressed to all executives at the senior vice president level or above, Mr. Chapek said a task force, led by Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy and general counsel Horacio Gutierrez, would review marketing, content and administrative spending across the entire company and recommend cuts.</p><p>\"I'm fully aware this will be a difficult process for many of you and your teams,\" Mr. Chapek said in the memo. \"We are going to have to make tough and uncomfortable decisions.\"</p><p>Companies across the media and technology sector have been announcing layoffs and purse-tightening measures as big bets on streaming and the metaverse made during the coronavirus pandemic show signs of unraveling.</p><p>Since launching its flagship Disney+ service in late 2019, Disney's streaming business has gained 235 million subscribers globally across all its video platforms, which include Hulu, ESPN+, the Star service in Europe and Hotstar in Asia. The growth transformed Disney over a short time into a massive player in the streaming world, capable of taking on Netflix Inc. and other rivals in dozens of markets around the world.</p><p>That growth, though, has come with a big cost: Disney's streaming segment has lost more than $8 billion in the last three years. Mr. Chapek has long insisted that Disney+ will be profitable in 2024 but has reduced his projections for the number of subscribers the service will sign up. This week he said the profitability target assumes there are no meaningful shifts in economic conditions.</p><p>During an earnings call with investors Tuesday, Ms. McCarthy, the finance chief, said that Disney would aggressively pursue spending cuts, and that \"some of those are going to provide some near-term savings and others are going to drive longer-term structural benefits.\"</p><p>Ms. McCarthy also referenced steps the company took at its theme parks division during the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, with parks shuttered, the company laid off thousands of employees and began work on new technologies to manage workers more efficiently.</p><p>Meta Platforms Inc., the parent company of Facebook, said this week it would eliminate 11,000 positions after growth in its virtual reality platforms was slower than it had hoped.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., owner of Hollywood's oldest film studio and the premium streaming service HBOMax has cut more than 1,000 positions as the company struggles to get out from under a hefty debt load.</p><p>Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal also is looking to reduce its head count and is offering buyouts to employees who are over the age of 57 and have been with the company at least 10 years, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Details Plans for Cost Cuts, Layoffs and Hiring Freeze in Memo</p>",
