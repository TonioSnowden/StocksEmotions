  "title": "Masks Come Off, but Confusion Remains After Federal Mandate Is Dropped; Many travelers remove their masks on public transportation for first time in over a year",
  "text": "<p>Soon after, a Biden administration official said the mandate is no longer in effect while the government considers its next steps.</p><p>Following the judge's ruling, the Transportation Security Administration said it would stop enforcing mask mandates, as did major U.S. airlines on domestic flights.Uber Technologies Inc. andLyft Inc. also saidthey would no longer require U.S. riders or drivers to wear masks.</p><p>While several American airports dropped the mandate, some didn't. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the area's airports, said Tuesday that mask rules would stay in place at New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports. Masks wouldn't be required at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, the agency said.</p><p>In Philadelphia, a city health department mandate requires everyone to wear a face mask in public indoor settings, so mask mandates still apply on the city's airport campus and across all terminals.</p><p>New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the mask requirement on public transit remains in effect \"for now,\" under a March 2 determination by the state Department of Health. Chicago's Metra commuter railroad is also keeping its mask mandate in place, at least for now, spokesman Michael Gillis said.</p><p>Others followed the federal government's lead. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said masks are no longer required on NJ Transit. \"Individuals may wear a mask based on personal preference, informed by personal level of risk,\" he said Tuesday on Twitter.</p><p>At New York City's JFK Airport Tuesday morning, signs in the preboarding area ofTerminal 4 reminded travelers to wear masks in accordance with federal law. An announcement played over the PA system reminding travelers to \"wear a face mask when required and follow the instructions of staff.\" A similar announcement played on the AirTrain, which connects all passenger terminals.</p><p>On aDelta Air Lines flight from JFK to Orlando early Tuesday, there were no reminders to wear masks.</p><p>Instead, during the pre-departure announcements, the pilot, Capt.Kenny Buckley, said: \"Welcome on our first flight without the mask mandate,\" followed by whoops and cheers from some passengers. Most passengers on the flight didn't wear masks. On the Delta flight to Orlando, most flight attendants wore masks.</p><p>In anote to employees yesterday, Delta said employees and customers may continue wearing masks if they so choose. The airline also said it could take time for the news to reach airline and TSA employees and for airport signage to be updated.</p><p>\"Remember to show understanding and patience with others who may not be aware enforcement is no longer required,\" the note to employees said.</p><p>About half of passengers in Orlando International Airport's main terminal were masked Tuesday. The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, which operates the airport, said it would remove signs and messaging throughout the airport. Enhanced cleaning methods will remain in place, it said.</p><p>For passengers, the first full day of travel without a mask mandate brought a mix of reactions, with some expressing concern and others joy. Because much of the airport signage and announcements still reminded passengers to wear masks, some passengers said they were confused or unaware the rules had changed.</p><p>Max Lippy, 26, traveled to Orlando from Hanover, Pa., with his wife and toddler. The family is spending the next eight days in Florida, with a visit to Disney, and are looking forward to the character meet-and-greets. Mr. Lippy, who is vaccinated, said he was glad to see the mandate removed.</p><p>\"At this point, there's no way you're going to get her to wear a mask,\" he said of his daughter, whom he said struggled with wearing a mask for long periods.</p><p>Colleen andMike Stankewich, of Guilford, Conn., were flying to Atlanta, then on to Turks and Caicos for a weeklong trip on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Stankewich, 51 years old, said most travelers in the airport were wearing masks, which made him wonder whether they were aware the mask mandate wasn't being enforced.</p><p>Ms. Stankewich, 52, said she was disappointed when she heard the news of the federal judge's ruling. At first, she thought the ruling only pertained to cruises and flights out of Florida, but later realized that wasn't the case.</p><p>She has been keeping an eye on the rise in cases due to theOmicron BA.2 variant. \"It's one way we can help keep each other safe and allow people to get to where they want to go,\" she said of wearing a mask. \"It's a pretty benign ask.\"</p><p>Some passengers said they still weren't sure about the rules.</p><p>Hasan Balkas, of Long Island, N.Y., waited to board a flight to Aruba with his wife and two children, ages 13 and 10. Mr. Balkas, 41, says he has been against the mask mandate from the beginning and intentionally booked his flight for April 19 because it would have been after the mandate was intended to expire on April 18.</p><p>Last week, the mandate was extended, but ultimately struck down on April 18 by the Florida judge.</p><p>Mr. Balkas wasn't wearing a mask in the airport and said he wasn't sure whether he needed to wear a mask on the flight itself, but brought one just in case. \"It should be everyone's choice at this point,\" he said.</p><p>â€”Alison Sider and Scott Calvert contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Allison Pohle at allison.pohle@wsj.com</p><p>Masks Come Off, but Confusion Remains After Federal Mandate Is Dropped</p>",
