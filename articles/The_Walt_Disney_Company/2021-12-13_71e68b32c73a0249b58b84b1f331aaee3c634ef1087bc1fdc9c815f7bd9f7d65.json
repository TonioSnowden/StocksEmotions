  "title": "Business News:  Sirius Hires a Builder of Disney+ Streaming Service  ----  By Anne Steele and Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>   Satellite radio broadcaster SiriusXM has tapped a top architect of the Disney+ streaming service to help it broaden its appeal to audiences outside the car. </p><p>    Joe Inzerillo, who as executive vice president and chief technology officer of Walt Disney Co.'s streaming unit played a key role in the creation and launch of the Disney+ platform, is joining Sirius XM Holdings Inc. next month as chief product and technology officer, the company said. </p><p>   In that role, Mr. Inzerillo is hoping to jump-start innovation at a company that once disrupted the over-the-air radio business and now finds itself being challenged by streaming titans that dominate music and podcast listening on mobile and at home. </p><p>   Mr. Inzerillo said SiriusXM won't be afraid to \"throw stuff against the wall\" and build products that the 150 million collective listeners of its platforms want to use. \"It's better to disrupt yourself than let somebody do it from the outside,\" he said. </p><p>   SiriusXM, whose radios are installed in eight out of every 10 new cars sold, is facing competition from tech companies, including Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose on-demand and curated audio streaming options have wrested listeners from radio. Such streaming services have become ubiquitous and follow users from their cellphones to their desktops, voice-activated home speakers and into their cars. </p><p>   SiriusXM reported 34.1 million total subscribers at the end of the third quarter, down from 34.3 million in the year-earlier period -- and down from its peak of 34.9 million subscribers in 2019 when it completed its acquisition of Pandora. Changes in promotional plans with some auto makers and lower vehicle shipments during the pandemic due to supply-chain issues have weighed on the business. Excluding subscribers who get the service free in promotions, self-pay subscriptions reached a record 32 million in the latest quarter. </p><p>   Sirius's $3 billion bet on Pandora was meant to help it expand its streaming offerings. The internet radio service known for its customized stations was at one time the largest streaming music provider in the U.S. but has been losing users for years. Pandora rolled out on-demand subscription options, but adoption was slow and it has refocused on its ad-supported business. </p><p>   SiriusXM has since placed more bets in podcasting -- a rapidly growing medium that has become a hotbed of deals for talent and content as Spotify invested hundreds of millions of dollars -- buying up E.W. Scripps Co.'s Stitcher podcasting unit and inking an exclusive deal for Marvel programs. </p><p>   \"The Sirius acquisition of Pandora was really smart, and I think not fully capitalized on yet,\" Mr. Inzerillo said, adding that there are more ways to explore bundling up the company's content. </p><p></p>",
