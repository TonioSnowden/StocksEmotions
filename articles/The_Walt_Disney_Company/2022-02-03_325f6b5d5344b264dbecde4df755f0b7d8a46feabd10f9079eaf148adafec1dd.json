  "text": "<p>BT has started exclusive discussions with US media group Discovery to form a joint venture for its BT Sport business, opting against a sale of the television network to the sports streaming company DAZN, owned by billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik.</p> <p>The deal, which is due to be finalised by the end of the year, would involve an alliance with Discovery-owned Eurosport UK, giving BT Sport's existing customers the rights to the US group's sports and media content and creating a stronger competitor to Sky in the UK.</p> <p>This would combine a wide catalogue of sports broadcast rights spanning the English Premier League and Uefa Champions League football matches in the UK, the Olympic Games, cycling's Grand Tours and the tennis Grand Slams, as well as other major sporting events.</p> <p>“Customers will get more choice, more flexibility as a result of the move,” said BT chief executive Philip Jansen, adding that BT and Discovery would split costs between them, including rights for content. “It keeps us in a competitive framework in a highly developing, highly changing environment.”</p> <p>DAZN had been the frontrunner in any future deal for BT Sport and the decision went right up to the wire, with board members only settling upon a Discovery joint venture in the middle of the night on Wednesday, according to people briefed on the discussions.</p> <p>Although BT's sport TV unit lost about £400mn in its early years, under Marc Allera, chief executive of BT's consumer division, it broke even and is understood to have attracted more than 4mn customers, including via cross-licensing. </p> <p>It became the most formidable competitor in sports broadcasting to Sky, owned by US telecoms group Comcast, which had been offering free broadband to its sports audiences.</p> <p>François Godard, an analyst at Enders Analysis, said he was surprised by BT's decision to form a joint venture but said the deal made sense for both parties, particularly in light of Discovery's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a424c8ae-c879-455c-8b57-fcf0605f03af\">combine with WarnerMedia</a> to compete in the streaming wars. </p> <p>“Discovery is merging with Warner, so it's becoming a global superpower in content,” he added. “They see sports as a way to differentiate and to score points in an arena where Disney and Netflix don't have a footprint.”</p> <p>The Discovery deal was likely to be viewed favourably by Sky because it would help secure access to BT Sport's content and because the company already had a somewhat fraught relationship with DAZN after a recent bidding war in Italy for the rights to Serie A, Godard added. </p> <p>BT Sport has wholesale deals with Sky to carry football matches and make them available to its subscribers, while Sky in turn carries a range of Discovery channels under a long-term partnership renewed last year. BT said it had reached an agreement in principle with Sky for a longer-term cross-licensing deal that would last beyond 2030.</p> <p>Discovery's victory is a blow to DAZN, which showed its appetite to broadcast live football by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd616305-d335-4799-9564-1b0c4be956d9\">outbidding Sky Italia</a> last year to acquire the rights to matches in Italy's Serie A games as part of a €2.5bn deal. It also screens La Liga football in Spain and the Bundesliga in Germany. </p> <p>Kevin Mayer, chair of DAZN, has made no secret of the company's desire to win rights to the Premier League, but said on Wednesday that a deal with BT Sport would have been “uneconomical”. </p> <p>“We remain fully committed to growing our business and investing in the UK, as you will see in the near future,” Mayer added.<br><br>The deal was announced as BT posted a fall in third-quarter revenue due to a weaker performance in its global and enterprise businesses, which was offset by a stronger performance at Openreach, its network infrastructure division. </p> <p>BT lowered its full-year revenue target by 2 per cent, but maintained its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation outlook at between £7.5bn and £7.7bn.<br><br>Revenue fell 2 per cent to £5.4bn while adjusted ebitda rose 4 per cent to £2bn in the three months to the end of December.</p> <p>Shares were down 3.4 per cent to £1.88 in morning trading on Thursday.
