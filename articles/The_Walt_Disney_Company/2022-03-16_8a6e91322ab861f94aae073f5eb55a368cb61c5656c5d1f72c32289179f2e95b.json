  "title": "From Apple to McDonald's, What Companies Have Pulled Back From Russia? A raft of Western businesses have suspended operations in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, with some deciding to pull out entirely",
  "text": "<p>Companies have flagged concerns about the conflict, worries about the safety of staff and the complications of doing business in the country as Western sanctions increase. While the relatively small size of the Russian economy—and the perceived difficulty of doing business there—means most multinationals have limited exposure to the country, several have built up businesses there.</p><p>In response, Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to Western companies in Russia, threatening to arrest corporate leaders there who criticize the government or to seize assets of companies that withdraw from the country, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has also expressed support for a law to nationalize assets of foreign companies that leave his country over its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, is urging international companies to exit Russia, adding further pressure on executives grappling with how to respond to Moscow's aggression.</p><p>Here is what some Western companies operating in Russia have said so far.</p><p>Autos</p><p>Ford Motor Co. suspended its joint venture with Russia's Sollers OJSC and halted sales to the country, citing concerns over the invasion. \"While we don't have significant operations in Ukraine, we do have a strong contingent of Ukrainian nationals working for Ford around the world,\" the company said. The U.S. auto maker had diminished its presence in Russia before the conflict, now only focusing on commercial-van manufacturing and sales through its joint venture with Sollers, in which it holds a minority stake.</p><p>Volkswagen AG has suspended production of all vehicles at its factories in Russia, adding that it was already seeing \"extensive interruption of business activities\" in the country. In addition to idling its two Russian plants, VW said it would also halt exports of vehicles to Russia. The decision affects the company's VW, Skoda, Audi, Porsche and Bentley brands. Last year, VW brands delivered 216,000 vehicles to customers in Russia, about 2.4% of the company's world-wide sales, a spokesman said.</p><p>Toyota Motor Corp. has said it would suspend production in Russia until further notice, citing difficulty getting the parts it needs. Toyota builds the Camry sedan and RAV4 models in its St. Petersburg plant and manufactures as many as 80,000 vehicles a year. Most of the vehicles are sold in Russia. Toyota said it would also halt sales of imported vehicles in Russia.</p><p>Aviation</p><p>Boeing Co. has suspended parts and maintenance support for Russian airlines and halted its activities in Moscow. The plane maker has also temporarily closed its office in Kyiv and paused operations at its Moscow Training Campus. The company told customers they may face potential delays in aircraft repair and maintenance requests to its design centers in Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Airbus SE said it has stopped providing support services to its customers in Russia in response to international sanctions levied by the European Union. The plane maker has also halted the supply of spare parts for its aircraft to Russian airlines in line with the new restrictions. Airbus operators in Russia include three of the country's biggest: national flag carrier Aeroflot-Russian Airlines, S7 Airlines and Rossiya Airlines.</p><p>Airlines world-wide are altering routes and canceling flights to avoid Russian airspace, changes that will lengthen journey times and raise costs for carriers that were starting to bounce back from their pandemic misery. U.S. passenger carriers don't operate nonstop flights to Russia, but United Airlines Holdings Inc. said it would stop flying over Russia on its route to India. American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. also said they are steering clear of Russian airspace.</p><p>Consulting</p><p>Accenture PLC said it was discontinuing its entire 2,300-people business in Russia. Rival consulting firms McKinsey &amp; Co. and Boston Consulting Group each said they are suspending operations in Russia.</p><p>The Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers—are cutting ties with their Russian operations, walking away from businesses built up over decades that between them employ more than 15,900 people.</p><p>Energy</p><p>British energy giant BP PLC said it was stepping back further from doing business with Russia, with a spokesman saying the company won't enter into new business with Russian entities or business involving Russian ports \"unless essential for ensuring security of supply.\" BP earlier said it would exit its nearly 20% stake in Russian government-controlled oil producer Rosneft, a move that came after it was pressured to unload the holding by U.K. officials.</p><p>Exxon Mobil Corp. said it is halting operations at a multibillion-dollar oil-and-gas project in Russia and would make no further investments in the country following the attack on Ukraine. The U.S. oil giant said it was preparing to shut down production from the massive Sakhalin Island development in Russia's Far East. Exxon owns a 30% stake in the project, alongside Rosneft, Japan's Sodeco and India's ONGC Videsh. The company said it is taking steps to exit the consortium.</p><p>Shell PLC said it would halt all spot purchases of Russian crude and will phase out its other trading and business dealings. Shell had previously said it would pull out of a number of joint ventures in the country.</p><p>Finance</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it is getting out of Russia, becoming the first big U.S. bank to make a move to exit the country after the invasion of Ukraine. The Wall Street bank said it is winding down its businesses and focused on helping its clients manage their own exposure or get out of the country.</p><p>Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. said they would suspend their Russian operations. The move means foreigners won't be able to use their Visa or Mastercard cards for purchases in the country, whether online or in person. Russian cardholders are still able to use these cards for purchases in Russia, but their transactions will travel over other networks, mainly Russia's homegrown payments system, Mir.</p><p>American Express Co. is also cutting off its service in Russia. Globally issued AmEx cards won't work at merchants or ATMs in Russia, and cards issued by Russian banks won't work outside the country on the AmEx network, the company said.</p><p>PayPal Holdings Inc. said it is suspending operations in Russia, as well as its international money-transfer service Xoom.</p><p>Food and Beverage</p><p>Smirnoff vodka and Guinness maker Diageo PLC has suspended exports to Ukraine and Russia, saying the move was in the best interest of its staff.</p><p>CocaCola Co. said it is suspending its business in Russia and that it would continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve.</p><p>PepsiCo said it was halting sales of its big soda brands in Russia such as Pepsi-Cola and 7UP but would continue to sell potato chips and daily essentials such as milk, cheese and baby formula.</p><p>McDonald's Corp. said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 stores in Russia and that it would continue paying the 62,000 people it employs there.</p><p>Starbucks Co. said it is suspending operations at Russia locations. The coffee giant also said that it is suspending shipment of its products to Russia, while the licensee that runs its 130 chain stores there will immediately stop operating.</p><p>Media</p><p>Some of Hollywood's biggest movie studios, including Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros., are delaying the release of highly anticipated films in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Netflix Inc. said it would suspend its service in Russia, which it launched less than a year ago. The company had previously said it wouldn't comply with a new Russian regulation that would require the platform to carry several state-run broadcasters. The decision to suspend operations in Russia wasn't related to the new regulation, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Retail</p><p>The parent company of casual clothing retailer Uniqlo said it would temporarily suspend its business in Russia, citing operational challenges and \"the worsening of the conflict situation.\" A spokeswoman for Fast Retailing Co. said the company would close the 50 Uniqlo stores in Russia over the next week to 10 days.</p><p>IKEA is closing all of its stores in Russia, stopping production in the country and halting all exports and imports to and from Russia and Belarus. IKEA brand owner Inter IKEA Group and store owner/operator Ingka Holding BV said in a joint statement that the war in Ukraine had already had a huge human impact, and was also resulting in serious disruptions to supply-chain and trading conditions.</p><p>Nike Inc. said it would temporarily close the stores it owns and operates in Russia, citing increasing challenges of managing its business. The sneaker giant said it would support its employees by continuing to pay salaries. There are about 116 Nike stores in Russia, according to the company's website.</p><p>H&amp;M owner H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB said it is temporarily pausing all sales in Russia. The Swedish fashion retailer has around 4,800 stores globally, of which around 170 are in Russia. The country is H&amp;M's sixth-largest market and contributed 3.6% of group sales in the most recent quarter.</p><p>The parent company of retailer T.J. Maxx said it plans to shed its Russian off-price retail chain Familia. TJX Cos., which paid $225 million for a 25% stake in Familia in 2019, said it may post a loss on the move.</p><p>Shipping and logistics</p><p>FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. have suspended shipments into Russia amid the country's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S.-based shipping giants had earlier cut off shipments to and from Ukraine and were preparing contingency plans for their Russian operations. Now, both have temporarily stopped delivering shipments bound for Russia.</p><p>UPS said that packages en route to Russia and Ukraine will be returned free of charge to the sender, if possible. \"Our focus is on the safety of our people, providing continued service and minimizing disruption to our customers,\" UPS said in a service alert on its website. \"UPS continues to closely monitor the situation and will re-establish service as soon as it is practical and safe to do so.\"</p><p>FedEx issued a similar service alert on its website. \"We are closely monitoring the situation and have contingency plans in place,\" FedEx said.</p><p>The world's biggest containership operators—A.P. Moller-Maersk A/SA.P. Moller-MaerskA.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Mediterranean Shipping Co.—said they would temporarily suspend services to Russian ports, including those far from the conflict in Ukraine. Maersk said it was halting bookings in light of the sanctions imposed on Russia. Maersk and MSC said they would continue to move foodstuffs to and from Russia.</p><p>Technology</p><p>Apple Inc. has stopped selling iPhones and other products in Russia, pausing all sales in the country and halting all exports into its Russian sales channels. The tech giant said it was supporting humanitarian efforts, providing aid for refugees and supporting its teams in the region.</p><p>Russia's RT News and Sputnik News apps are no longer available for download through Apple's App Store outside of Russia. The tech giant's Apple Pay has been limited in Russia and it also disabled traffic and live incidents from its Maps in Ukraine.</p><p>Google has also blocked access to Russian state-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik across Europe in compliance with an EU sanctions order.</p><p>\"In light of the extraordinary circumstances, we're pausing Google ads in Russia. The situation is evolving quickly, and we will continue to share updates when appropriate,\" the company said. Google has also started blocking ads related to the conflict that seek to take advantage of the situation and paused monetization of Russian state-funded media across its platforms.</p><p>Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. on March 4 said it was putting at least a temporary stop to running ads targeting users in Russia and wouldn't run ads anywhere from advertisers within Russia. The move came after the Russian government announced that it had blocked access to Facebook within the country in response to restrictions it said the social-media giant placed on Russian media outlets.</p><p>Samsung Electronics Co. said it would suspend shipments of all its products to Russia. The South Korean tech company is the top seller of smartphones in the country, with a market share of roughly 30%, according to Counterpoint Research, which tracks handset shipments. Samsung also sells semiconductors and a range of consumer electronics in Russia.</p><p>TikTok said it had suspended new video uploads and live streaming in Russia after the country implemented a law threatening prison time for anyone publishing what authorities consider to be false information about the invasion.</p><p>—Alistair Macdonald, William Boston, Nora Eckert, Benjamin Katz, Doug Cameron, Mike Cherney, Christopher M.
