  "text": "<p>The rollout of the ad-supported Disney+ follows a few tumultuous weeks for the media giant. Disney last month announced companywide cost-cutting measures and told division leaders that layoffs were likely. The board then ousted Bob Chapek as chief executive and brought back Robert Iger, the company's former chairman and CEO who had previously left at the end of last year. </p><p>Mr. Iger told employees in a companywide town-hall meeting last month that he will emphasize profitability over growing subscriber numbers at the company's streaming service.</p><p>Investors and analysts expect ads and higher subscription costs will produce higher profits for the company's streaming segment, but note that price increases could raise the streaming platform's churn rate, or the percentage of subscribers who cancel the service each month.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Disney+ With Ads Goes Live</p>",
