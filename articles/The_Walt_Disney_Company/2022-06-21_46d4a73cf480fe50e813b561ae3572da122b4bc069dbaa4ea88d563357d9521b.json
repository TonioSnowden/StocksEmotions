  "title": "Walden's  Power at  Disney Grows  ----  By Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>   Writer and producer Danny Strong was unaccustomed to high-ranking television executives calling him at odd hours for in-depth discussions about a project. </p><p>   That changed when he began making shows for Dana Walden, who last week was thrust into the role of chairman of Walt Disney Co.'s General Entertainment Content unit, a job that comes with oversight of more than 300 shows and an annual budget of around $10 billion. </p><p>   Already one of the highest-ranking executives at Disney, Ms. Walden is quickly taking on more responsibility after Peter Rice's abrupt dismissal as head of the unit after clashes with Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek and other members of senior management. </p><p>   It is an awkward transition. Ms. Walden worked for Mr. Rice for many years, first at Fox and then at Disney, which acquired the bulk of Fox's entertainment assets in 2019. </p><p>   Now she will lead the entire unit and look to steer clear of the corporate drama that felled Mr. Rice while reassuring talent that Disney is a stable place to take their projects. </p><p>   She is known for having a deft touch with writers and producers. </p><p>   Mr. Strong recalled Ms. Walden calling on a Sunday night in March 2021 about the musical score for \"Dopesick,\" the limited series about the opioid crisis inspired by the book of the same name, which he was making for Disney's Hulu. </p><p>   Ms. Walden had concerns about some scenes in which investigators dig into making a case against the Sackler family's Purdue Pharma, the makers of the drug OxyContin. She felt the music should be more propulsive so it would contrast with the somber melodies accompanying darker scenes showing the effects of opioid addiction, he said. </p><p>   \"We spoke for about 45 minutes, which blew me away that the person that oversees multiple networks and TV studios wanted to talk to me on a Sunday night about music cues,\" Mr. Strong said. \"She comes with some really great thoughts. I don't feel like I'm being hounded with all these notes from Dana trying to make it her show,\" he added. </p><p>   Ms. Walden's role is a vital one at a company that has bet its future on having strong content across all its platforms, particularly streaming services Disney+ and Hulu. Disney -- like all media giants -- is putting greater emphasis on streaming to better compete against Netflix Inc. and others. </p><p>   At the same time, Ms. Walden will have to try to keep the ABC broadcast network and cable channels on track. They have endured ratings declines over the past several years because of audience fragmentation and the growth of streaming. </p><p>   With Mr. Rice gone, Ms. Walden will add his responsibilities to her duties. She had previously been tasked with generating content for the ABC network as well as for cable channels including Freeform and the Hulu and Disney+ streaming platforms. </p><p>   Now ABC News, the Disney Channel, FX and National Geographic cable networks also report to her. She oversees the Onyx Collective, Disney's unit devoted to highlighting creators of color, which made the Oscar-winning documentary \"Summer of Soul.\" </p><p>    \"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane said Ms. Walden is unlike many Hollywood executives who rely on groupthink, adding she is willing to go out on a limb for what she believes in. </p><p>   \"I've never seen her make any decision that is fear-based,\" he said. </p><p>   A Los Angeles native, the 57-year-old Ms. Walden was obsessed with television and horses growing up, riding show hunters competitively until graduating from the University of Southern California. </p><p>   Ms. Walden started in public relations, including a stint with then late-night star Arsenio Hall. She eventually landed at Fox's television production studio in communications. </p><p>   She segued into programming after a presentation at a retreat where she said the studio needed to be more aggressive if it wanted to compete with Warner Bros. and other rivals. It was a \"Jerry Maguire\" moment, but rather than getting fired for speaking up, she was moved into a programming position by Peter Chernin, who was running the movie and TV studio at that time. </p><p>   Eventually, Ms. Walden was paired with Gary Newman, whose forte was finance, and the duo ran the TV studio and then added responsibility for the Fox network over their two-decade partnership. Mr. Newman didn't move to Disney after it acquired the bulk of Fox's entertainment assets in 2019. In her new role, Ms. Walden will have sole responsibility and is one of a handful of executives reporting directly to Mr. Chapek. </p><p>   There were challenges along the way. The years that they oversaw the Fox network, its ratings in viewers and the coveted 18-49 audience fell at a faster rate than those for most of their rivals. Some attribute that to the network's younger audience embracing streaming and other platforms more quickly than the older audiences at the other networks. </p><p>   An exacting executive and something of a taskmaster, Ms. Walden keeps her team on their toes, according to people who have worked alongside her. Some describe her as a singularly focused leader who knows when to take a firm stand. </p><p>   Liz Meriwether, creator of the Hulu limited series \"The Dropout\" about Elizabeth Holmes and her failed blood-testing company Theranos, recalled a stern talk from Ms. Walden several years ago when she was feeling burned out as executive producer of the Fox comedy \"New Girl.\" </p><p>   \"She gave me a tough-love speech. I needed to step up and start acting like a leader and seeing myself as a leader. It was a life-changing moment for me. In a lot of cases I would have been fired, but she went the other direction and put more faith and trust in me,\" she said. </p><p></p>",
