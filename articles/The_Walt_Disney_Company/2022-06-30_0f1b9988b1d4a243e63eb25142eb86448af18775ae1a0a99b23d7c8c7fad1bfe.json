  "title": "Atlanta, series 3 review — Donald Glover returns with more absurdist, subversive storytelling",
  "text": "<p>“Some of the best television ever made.” That's what Donald Glover promised to deliver with the new series of <em>Atlanta</em>: his exquisitely idiosyncratic yet piercing look at race, music and masculinity. Now, two years on from that hype-generating announcement — and a whole four years since the last season aired — viewers in the UK will finally be able to see for themselves whether this latest instalment is indeed, as its confident polymath creator-writer-actor claimed, only rivalled by <em>The Sopranos</em>. </p> <p>Such sweeping assessments — even when made with an assumed degree of self-awareness — are of course largely unedifying. But what is immediately clear when watching the first few episodes of the third series on Disney Plus, is that it continues to be the nonpareil TV offering for absurdist, subversive storytelling. After all, what other programme would have the chutzpah to kick off its highly anticipated return with a non sequitur opener that features none of the core cast? </p> <p>Although <em>Atlanta</em> has never been overly interested in linear plotting and narrative continuity, it previously always took its main characters along on its meanderings through every genre from farce to horror. Now, before reacquainting us with the rapper Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), his hapless cousin-cum-manager Earn (Glover) and one-man entourage Darius (LaKeith Stanfield), we're treated to a terrifically disquieting standalone “black fairytale”. </p> <p>Like <em>Get Out</em>, “Three Slaps” lacerates the skin-deep progressiveness of certain members of the white middle class with dark, uneasy humour. It revolves around a young black boy, Loquareeous (Christopher Farrar), who's taken into care by a hippieish lesbian couple — professional tea fermenters, Amber and Gayle (Laura Dreyfuss and Jamie Neumann).</p> <p>The two treat their four black wards more as walking tokens of their allyship than as humans. They feed the children uncooked scraps of meat, lecture them about privilege and decry cultural appropriation while encouraging them to sing slave songs as they toil in the garden. When Loquareeous manages to alert a police officer of the abuse, his panic is greeted by the cop with a blunt response: “Kid, I almost shot you”. Things only get more sinister from there, as Glover draws on a real-life 2018 tragedy involving two parents and their six adopted children. </p> <p>A statement curtain raiser gives way to a more “conventional” second episode that reminds us both of the show's elasticity and the draw of its charming ensemble. The series takes us to a host of European capitals as we follow Paper Boi on tour. While he enjoys his growing fame and fortune — and the luxurious conditions of an Amsterdam jail holding cell — Earn is still making a poor fist of life as an impresario, waking up in the wrong country entirely. Even the perma-stoned (albeit surprisingly perspicacious) Darius proves more dependable, picking up the former's on-off girlfriend Vanessa (Zazie Beetz) at the airport before embarking on a strange caper in the city.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a running joke at the expense of a racist Dutch Christmas folk tradition is paid off with a wickedly funny — and quite literal — punchline. It's nice to see that even in the pursuit of television immortality, Glover hasn't lost sight of the value of a solid gag.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>All episodes available on Disney Plus and Hulu now</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Atlanta, series 3 review — Donald Glover returns with more absurdist, subversive storytelling' FT.com 30 June.
