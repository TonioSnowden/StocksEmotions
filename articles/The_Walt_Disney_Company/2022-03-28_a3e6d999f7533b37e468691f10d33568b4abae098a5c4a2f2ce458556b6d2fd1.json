  "title": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Signs Bill Restricting Teaching About Sexual Orientation; The measure, which opponents call the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, passed the Republican-led legislature earlier this month",
  "text": "<p>The measure, which takes effect July 1, sparked demonstrations by opponents in the state capital of Tallahassee and elsewhere. It drew criticism and mockery on \"Saturday Night Live\" and during the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday. And it created challenges for Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Chapek, who initially sought to avoid publicly wading into the political debate but wound up in a spat with Mr. DeSantis.</p><p>\"You've seen a lot of sloganeering and fake narratives by leftist politicians, by activists, by corporate media,\" Mr. DeSantis said at a bill-signing event in Spring Hill, Fla. \"We will continue to recognize that in the state of Florida, parents have a fundamental role in the education, healthcare and well-being of their childrenâ€¦We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.\"</p><p>After the bill was signed, a Disney spokesperson said the bill \"should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that.\"</p><p>LGBT-rights groups Equality Florida and the Human Rights Campaign said they would be part of that effort. \"We're staring at a new reality where LGBTQ+ students may wonder if they're allowed to even acknowledge their own sexuality or gender identity,\" said Joni Madison, the HRC's interim president. \"This restriction on free speech flies in the face of one of our most sacred rights.\"</p><p>U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said his department would monitor the law's implementation to determine whether it violates federal civil-rights law. \"This is a part of a disturbing and dangerous trend across the country of legislation targeting LGBTQI+ students, educators and individuals,\" he said.</p><p>The bill forbids instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade and bans it in later grades if not \"age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\" It prevents school districts from withholding information about a student's mental, emotional or physical health, potentially including matters of gender identity, from parents. And it allows parents to sue school districts over alleged violations of the measure.</p><p>Michael Woods, a special-education teacher in Palm Beach County who also teaches a unit on human growth and development for ninth-graders, said existing state standards clearly define what teachers can and can't address. The youngest students aren't taught about sexual orientation and gender identity, he said.</p><p>\"This is a solution in search of a problem that didn't exist,\" said Mr. Woods. He said he worried that the measure \"now specifically targets a marginalized group of people by name\" and would make students who are grappling with issues of sexuality or gender feel less safe confiding in a teacher.</p><p>January Littlejohn, a mother of three children who backs the measure and appeared with Mr. DeSantis at the signing event, said she believed schools were cutting parents out of critical decisions involving their children. \"These parental-rights violations must stop, and school districts must be held accountable when they break the law,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Florida Gov.
