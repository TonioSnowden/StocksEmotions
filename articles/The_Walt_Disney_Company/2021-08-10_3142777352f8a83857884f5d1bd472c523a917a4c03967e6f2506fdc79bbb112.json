  "title": "Monday's Markets:  S&P, Dow Give Ground as Oil Slumps  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Alexander Osipovich",
  "text": "<p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 retreated as a tumble in oil prices signaled investor unease about the Covid-19 pandemic and the strength of the economic recovery. </p><p>   The Dow dropped 106.66 points, or 0.3%, to 35101.85. The broader S&amp;P 500 slipped 4.17, or less than 0.1%, to 4432.35. The Nasdaq Composite rose 24.42, or 0.2%, to 14860.18. </p><p>   Stocks are hovering near records, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 notching a high on Friday. The Nasdaq was also at a record last week. </p><p>   Front-month futures on Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, dropped $1.66 a barrel, or 2.3%, to settle at $69.04, a three-week low. China's new measures to combat the Delta variant of Covid-19 renewed concerns that the virus would hit energy demand. </p><p>   Oil prices also were weighed down by data over the weekend showing that China imported less crude a day in July than in June, analysts said. China is the world's largest importer of oil. </p><p>   Stocks are likely to keep rising in the medium term, fueled by an economic recovery and strong corporate earnings, but some short-term hiccups are likely, said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist and portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management. </p><p>   \"In the short run, we could see some consolidation given uncertainty over issues including the Delta variant, stimulus legislation and the inflation [versus] growth debate,\" Mr. Adams said. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 1.316% from 1.288% Friday, in its fifth consecutive trading sessions of gains. Bond yields rise as prices fall. </p><p>   Bitcoin rose 3.7%, compared with its level at 5 p.m. ET on Friday. The cryptocurrency was trading at $45,481, its highest level since May. </p><p>   Investors continued to monitor corporate earnings. Household names such as Walt Disney and Airbnb are scheduled to report later this week. </p><p>   \"It's been a very impressive earnings season,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"Forecasts were pretty high and lofty, but many companies still managed to meet and beat them. It's reaffirmed that despite all the concerns about weakening growth, the fundamentals have been strong for companies.\" </p><p>    Berkshire Hathaway rose $1,721, or 0.4%, to $431,881 a class A share. </p><p>   Warren Buffett's conglomerate reported higher net earnings over the weekend, driven by growth at its railroad, utilities and energy companies. </p><p>    Tyson Foods advanced $6.18, or 8.7%, to $77.30 after the poultry firm reported a rise in profit and sales, driven by restaurants reopening. </p><p>   Sanderson Farms climbed $13.51, or 7.4%, to $195.88 after Cargill and Continental Grain confirmed they would buy the chicken producer for $4.5 billion. </p><p>   Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which is scheduled to post earnings Tuesday, rallied $22.21, or 8.6%, to $280.47, boosted by gains in the price of bitcoin. Golden Nugget Online Gaming shares soared $6.23, or 51%, to $18.50 after DraftKings said it reached an agreement to acquire the internet gambling company in an all-stock transaction. </p><p>    Moderna shares surged $70.75, or 17%, to $484.47 after the biotech company said its Covid-19 vaccines had been granted provisional registration in Australia. </p><p>   In commodities, gold futures fell 2.1% to $1,723.40 a troy ounce. </p><p>   Front-month silver futures slid 4.3% to $23.255 a troy ounce, their lowest settlement since November. </p><p>   Low liquidity in markets during the summer months is likely exacerbating the moves, said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. </p><p>   \"You get people and organizations systematically exploiting low liquidity to push their positions, it happens from time to time. Silver is even less liquid than gold,\" said Mr. Galy. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2% to set a record. </p><p>   A data release showed that German exports rose in June and have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, according to an analysis by Dutch bank ING. </p><p>   Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.2% and South Korea's Kospi was down 0.7%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
