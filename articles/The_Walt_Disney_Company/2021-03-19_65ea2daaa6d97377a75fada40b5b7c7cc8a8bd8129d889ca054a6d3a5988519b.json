  "text": "<p>Sinclair will spend more than $10 million this year on marketing the renamed Bally Sports networks, including the launch campaign as well as other programs throughout the year, according to Sinclair's chief marketing officer, John Zeigler.</p><p>It will complement that spending with promotion on other Sinclair properties, including broadcast TV stations that overlap geographically with the sports networks, the Tennis Channel, the digital sports network Stadium and the streaming service STIRR, Mr. Zeigler said. Sinclair will seek to mine its other assets to promote the new Bally Sports networks more than it did in their previous incarnations, he added.</p><p>Sinclair acquired the 21 Fox Sports-branded regional sports networks, or RSNs, from Walt Disney Co. in a 2019 deal valued at more than $10 billion. The networks collectively cover 16 National Basketball Association teams, 14 Major League Baseball teams, 12 National Hockey League teams and more than 4,500 live events a year, according to Sinclair.</p><p>Bally's is paying Sinclair $88 million over 10 years for the naming rights, which take effect on March 31.</p>",
