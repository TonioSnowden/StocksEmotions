  "title": "Why Many Brands Have Kept Their Voices Down on Roe v. Wade (So Far); Marketers including Levi's and Yelp quickly spoke up after the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that could overturn Roe v. Wade",
  "text": "<p>\"OkCupid has proudly supported reproductive rights for years, and we're not stopping now,\" the dating service wrote on Twitter, for example. \"Gender equality is at stake and more brands need to step up.\"</p><p>But many more companies have kept to the sidelines. And more than a dozen brands that have previously taken positions on other issues either declined to comment on the draft opinion or didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>A variety of factors is likely at play, including fear of alienating consumers or other constituencies and the fact that the Supreme Court hasn't yet ruled on the case, some marketing experts said.</p><p>Some companies are still considering the expectations of employees and others with an interest in their business, said Andrea Hagelgans, U.S. managing director of social issues engagement at communications firm Edelman, which has been consulting with clients on the issue since the draft opinion emerged.</p><p>That might mean gathering opinions internally from employees and employee resource groups, for example, before deciding whether to release a public statement, Ms. Hagelgans said.</p><p>Public-relations agency Zeno Group instructed staff to tell clients that if they do take a position, they should avoid \"taking a stand that they cannot reverse, especially when the decision is not final.\"</p><p>The subject of abortion is a particularly divisive issue, a Zeno executive wrote in an email to the agency's client leaders. \"Subjects that divide the country can sometimes be no-win situations for companies because regardless of what they do they will alienate at least 15 to 30 percent of their stakeholders,\" the email said.</p><p>The email was previously reported by the newsletter Popular Information.</p><p>Zeno Chief Executive Officer Barby Siegel said the email was sent soon after the leak and only concerned clients' potential initial reactions. \"It was meant to advise clients within the first 24 hours of breaking news, and its intent was to counsel clients to be measured in their immediate response to a complex developing story,\" Ms. Siegel said.</p><p>Companies should take stands on major issues when it is consistent with their values and actions, she added.</p><p>The goal is to reinforce existing brand identities on issues that matter to customers and employees, said Marisa Mulvihill, partner and head of brand and activation at Prophet Brand Strategy Inc., a marketing consulting firm.</p><p>\"If they're authentic in what they stand for and they reinforce it consistently, then it's credible,\" Ms. Mulvihill said. \"And then the audience for whom that resonates will stand with them.\"</p><p>But Roe v. Wade in particular involves religious beliefs that can make companies more concerned about offending people's views, Ms. Mulvihill said.</p><p>And there can be consequences to taking on social issues, beyond alienating consumers who take a different view. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last month signed into law a bill stripping Walt Disney Co. of a special tax status, a move that followed the company's public opposition to a state bill limiting classroom instruction on gender and sexuality.</p><p>Levi's sought to defend Roe v. Wade on business grounds in its statement following the leak of the draft opinion. \"Protecting access to the full range of reproductive health care, including abortion, is a critical business issue,\" the apparel maker wrote.</p><p>Expressing convictions on public issues can be good business in itself, said Melissa Hobley, global chief marketing officer at OkCupid.</p><p>\"Consumers will take note and they will remember and we can see the chatter on Twitter and on Snap and on TikTok of people saying, 'Why hasn't my company spoken up for me?'\" Ms. Hobley said.</p><p>Expectations around corporate citizenship are changing, with many consumers and employees looking for companies to become engaged in social issues, said Chris Miller, global head of activism strategy at Ben &amp; Jerry's.</p><p>\"It is going to become increasingly hard for them to stay on the sidelines on it,\" Mr. Miller said of companies choosing not to comment on the leaked draft opinion.</p><p>Some consumers might use the leaked opinion as a litmus test, said Aimee Drolet Rossi, professor of marketing and behavioral decision making at the University of California, Los Angeles's Anderson School of Management.</p><p>\"There is no question that this is an enormous sea change,\" Prof. Drolet Rossi said. \"And, given that, one would expect that certain brands will have to take a stance—and not a weak stance.\"</p><p>While it remains unclear whether more companies will release public statements in the coming days or weeks, some might communicate related policies to employees or develop a long-term strategy, Ms. Hagelgans of Edelman said.</p><p>\"I would not take the silence to mean that it is going to be permanent silence,\" she said.</p><p>Nat Ives contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Ann-Marie Alcántara at ann-marie.alcantara@wsj.com</p><p>Why Many Brands Have Kept Their Voices Down on Roe v.
