The Stoxx Europe 600 was flat as gains for real-estate stocks offset losses for shares of media and financial-service companies.</p><p>Siemens rose 6.1% after the German industrial company said rising orders goosed quarterly revenue and profits. Société Générale said profits climbed in the final quarter of 2021, lifting shares 4.7%. Delivery Hero plunged 22% after the German food-delivery firm said it lost money in 2021.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite ticked up 0.2%.
