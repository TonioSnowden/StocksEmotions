For everyone else, let's go.</em></p> <h1>Boycotting Beijing: the Olympian cost of US-China tensions</h1> <p>Less than three months into the new <strong>Biden</strong> administration, the <strong>US State Department </strong>started an international kerfuffle after a spokesman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92d57e46-4c63-46f2-be08-de8a9954256e\">said the country</a> is discussing with allies a potential joint boycott of the 2022 <strong>Winter Olympics</strong> in Beijing.</p> <p>The remarks set off a firestorm about the future of those Games, which are just 10 months away. The underlying issue is concern about China's repression of its minority Uyghur population, which both the Biden and Trump administrations have described as a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0d613c6-fa92-48c7-ac3a-aa2614c25e9c\">genocide</a>”.&#xa0;</p> <p>A Cold War-era boycott of the Olympics, if taken, would be a serious escalation of tensions between the US and China.</p> <p>What remains unclear is whether such a boycott would bar athletes from participating, or if it were a “diplomatic boycott”, in which governments decline to send high-ranking members of their administration to the Olympics, as the US did at the 2014 winter games in Sochi, Russia.</p> <p>Either scenario is worrisome for the <strong>International Olympic Committee</strong>, whose business of staging and broadcasting the Games has, for years, been dogged by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/594d2320-5326-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef\">dwindling number of viable host nations</a> willing to take on the multibillion-dollar responsibility.&#xa0;</p> <p>Only Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan — a nation that is <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/kazakhstan\">no stranger to human rights criticisms</a> — presented full bids for the 2022 Olympics.</p> <p>The US and China are the two largest economies in the world, and, accordingly, boast two of the most robust Olympic teams. Along with Italy, they are the only nations which have either held or are slated to host an Olympics twice this century. Together they have spent or committed to spend <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-la-2028-olympics-budget-20190429-story.html\">a combined </a><a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2018/01/23/salt-lake-could-host-winter-olympics-for-less-than-cost-of-its-2002-games-says-committee/\">$8.3bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/sport/china/article/3120324/beijing-2022-winter-olympics-guide-venues-boycott-tickets-cost-mascot\">$44bn</a>, respectively, on staging their Games.&#xa0;</p> <p>On top of that, US and Chinese broadcasting rights to the Olympics, where the IOC derives nearly three quarters of its revenues, are among the costliest. The two countries have multiyear TV deals that run into the 2030s worth over <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2014/05/07/nbc-olympics-broadcast-rights-2032/8805989/\">$8bn</a> <a href=\"https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1024163/ioc-cashes-in-on-asia-s-hat-trick-of-olympic-wins-with-550-million-tv-deal-in-china\">combined</a>.</p> <p>Both the IOC and the <strong>US Olympic and Paralympic Committee</strong> say they are opposed to athlete boycotts. Both point out that the organisation of the Games and delegations sent are the domain of sport governing bodies, not governments.&#xa0;</p> <p>But put simply, the Olympic movement can't afford hostility between two of its largest stakeholders.</p> <p><em>Read the FT editorial board's view on a potential Olympic boycott </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd1d63dd-2260-4220-b6e9-9e12bd0cbe46?\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Why the biggest Premier League clubs don't fetch “insane” prices</h1> <p><strong>Tom Werner</strong>, the chair of <strong>Fenway Sports Group</strong>, the investment vehicle that owns <strong>Liverpool</strong> and the <strong>Boston Red Sox, </strong>was asked last week what it would take to sell either club.</p> <p>“If someone comes into your house and offers you an insane price, you examine it,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c01749e7-3462-4f5f-bc91-a9f95a96f00c\">told the FT</a>. “But our interest certainly is to retain and grow the properties that we have.”</p> <p>In a way, it is a statement of the obvious. Of course, you consider selling an asset if someone is willing to pay over the odds. But Werner's answer is a reminder that sports club owners are not fans. FSG's game is to make a profit. And the easiest way to make a hefty return is securing a mega price for its clubs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Perhaps that wouldn't be difficult for the Red Sox, one of the more storied franchises in <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>. Just last October, hedge fund magnate <strong>Steve Cohen</strong> bought the <strong>New York Mets </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de1a3612-f1f8-440c-b9fb-197d3a9bee1f\">for $2.4bn</a>.</p> <p>Selling Liverpool, which FSG acquired <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f9e3dc4-d841-11df-a7b4-00144feabdc0\">for £300m in 2010</a>, is a trickier proposition. The team is the current champions of the English <strong>Premier League</strong>, the world's richest and most watched domestic football competition.&#xa0;</p> <p>Rival <strong>Manchester United</strong>, listed on the <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong>, has a current market capitalisation of around $2.7bn. <strong>Avram Glazer</strong>, a member of the family that acquired the club in a £790m leveraged buyout in 2005, made plans last month to sell enough shares to raise around $100m.</p> <p>In 2019, <strong>Manchester City'</strong>s parent company was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c082178-104b-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">valued at $4.8bn</a>, after selling a 10 per cent stake to private equity firm <strong>Silver Lake</strong> for $500m. In 2018, <strong>Arsenal</strong>'s majority owner <strong>Stan Kroenke</strong> paid £550m for Russian billionaire <strong>Alisher Usmanov</strong>'s 30 per cent stake in the club, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b067cf36-9a08-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d\">valuing it at £1.8bn</a>.</p> <p>What these deals have in common are multibillion-dollar valuations — earned from smaller sales of minority stakes. <strong>Chelsea</strong>'s <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> has demanded <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0fe56fa-1ae3-11ea-9186-7348c2f183af\">around £3bn</a> from recent suitors. There have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e76f7d2-a951-11e8-89a1-e5de165fa619\">no willing buyers</a>.</p> <p>Rather than holding out for a deep-pocketed buyer, FSG has secured new investment from <strong>RedBird Capital</strong> which values the group at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b17ded95-3d07-46d7-a7db-448de79b4b66\">$7.35bn</a>. It hopes to buy more teams, grow its sports portfolio, then perhaps, launch an IPO. That would be a slower, steadier and saner way of extracting a return on investment.</p> <p><em>Read the FT's interview with Tom Werner </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c01749e7-3462-4f5f-bc91-a9f95a96f00c\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Are fan ‘tokens' a pandemic cash grab or sport's new moneymaker?</h1> <p>Ticket sales, sponsorship and broadcast revenues are the three main pillars of income for sports groups. But the pandemic has led to empty stadiums, as well as rebates to sponsors and broadcasters due to cancelled fixtures.&#xa0;</p> <p>This has highlighted the need for sports to diversify their revenues. Increasingly, they are thinking digitally, turning to the emerging online economy powered by the blockchain technology behind <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, the biggest cryptocurrency.</p> <p>The <strong>National Basketball Association</strong> is among the first-movers, selling officially licensed highlights in the form of “non-fungible tokens,” or NFTs, to fans through its <strong>Top Shot</strong> venture. (Read more about the NFTs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ef91ab2-4a9d-4e67-a7a2-2136f174a8b7\">here</a>) This week, <strong>Tom Brady</strong>, the seven-time <strong>National Football League </strong>Super Bowl champion, announced he is starting his own digital collectibles platform called <a href=\"https://autograph.io/\"><strong>Autograph</strong></a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Malta-based <strong>Chiliz</strong> works with sports leagues and teams to sell digital “tokens” that offer special perks for the fans that own them. For example, <strong>Juventus</strong>, the Italian football team, has allowed token holders to choose which song should be played to celebrate its goals.&#xa0;</p> <p>Chiliz has created a digital currency that can be used to buy these fan tokens via its <strong>Socios</strong> app. It is also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-blockchain-chiliz-idUSKBN2AU0PA\">planning a $50m expansion to the US</a>, and has partnered with <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship</strong>, the mixed martial arts competition.</p> <p><strong>Alexandre Dreyfus</strong>, chief executive of Chiliz, told Scoreboard that sports clubs “used to focus on the 0.1 per cent of their customers that are in the stadium and make the noise . . . but most of the clubs never really engaged transactionally, except to sell their jersey, with their global fan base.”</p> <p>Dreyfus claims to have generated $30m in revenue in the final quarter of last year. He is targeting $150m this year, generated from selling tokens and subsequent fees as users buy and sell in the secondary market. Roughly half of the revenue goes to clubs, he says.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are risks however. Early tie-ups between sports clubs and cryptocurrency groups have caused concern that fans would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/284b9832-c7ce-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9\">buy digital items</a> on a belief these were investments that would rise in value.&#xa0;</p> <p>The NFT craze has been criticised as a bubble, with sceptics believing that those paying huge prices for digital collectibles are unlikely to recoup cash in future. &#xa0;</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether this is a short-term punt by clubs grasping for cash until traditional revenue streams return as fans filter back into stadiums. Dreyfus is bullish.</p> <p>“You could argue that even if the clubs may have done that opportunistically at first,” he said. “Now it becomes a real revenue stream and therefore they are way more committed.”</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>French Open</strong> at<strong> Roland Garros</strong> has been <a href=\"https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/article/new-dates-tournament-2021-postponed-by-one-week\">pushed back by one week</a> in the hope of admitting as many fans as possible to the tennis grand slam.
