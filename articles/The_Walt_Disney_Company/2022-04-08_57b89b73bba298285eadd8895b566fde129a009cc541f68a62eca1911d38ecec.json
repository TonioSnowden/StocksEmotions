  "title": "Disney Launches Orlando Affordable Housing Development; Company is committing nearly 80 acres of land for project",
  "text": "<p>Disney employees as well as the general public can apply for the units, the company said. It will offer a variety of home choices near the Flamingo Crossings Town Center retail and dining complex located just outside the gates of Disney World in Orlando. The company didn't disclose additional details about the project, including pricing.</p><p>The project marks Disney's latest residential real estate venture. It comes as the typical home value in Orlando has risen to about $345,500, a 25% increase over a year earlier, according to Zillow Inc. The median household income for Orange County was about $61,400 in 2020, according to U.S. Census data.</p><p>Low home inventory, along with high demand from buyers, pushed up home prices in the Orlando region, said Tansey Soderstrom, president of the Orlando Regional Realtor Association. She said she expects home prices will continue rising in 2022.</p><p>\"It's difficult for people to find a rental, much less an affordable home,\" Ms. Soderstorm said.</p><p>Other Orlando theme parks are also getting into affordable-housing development. Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, owned by Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, said in March it would donate 20 acres of land to be used for an affordable-housing venture. That will be used to create 1,000 mixed-income and affordable housing units, the company said. Rents will range from $400 to $2,000, according to a spokeswoman for Wendover Housing Partners, the developer of that project.</p><p>Disney has long sold luxury vacation homes in its 980-acre gated Golden Oak community in Florida. But the company has been getting more involved in residential real estate in recent years.</p><p>The company said in February it would start developing residential communities called Storyliving by Disney. The first will open in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Disney's research-and-development team, known as Imagineers, will develop the Rancho Mirage project. Residents will get access to a waterfront clubhouse, a club-only beach area and recreational water activities, as well as Disney programming, entertainment and activities. One part of the development will be for residents 55 and up.</p><p>Back in the 1990s, Disney developed a residential community near Walt Disney World called Celebration. It featured buildings designed by architects who helped create the company's theme parks and corporate campuses. Disney later divested most of its interest in Celebration.</p><p>Disneyland Resort also provided funding for an affordable-housing development called Buena Esperanza for veterans and formerly homeless residents, which opened in 2021 in Anaheim, Calif. The company is providing funds for a similar project in Anaheim called Finamore Place, planned to open this summer.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Launches Orlando Affordable Housing Development</p>",
