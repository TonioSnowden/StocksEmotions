  "text": "<p>Happiest after quarantine</p><p>And they have emerged with a newfound desire to live it up.</p><p>Vanessa Marquette, 32, and her husband spent 10 days quarantined over Christmas after she began feeling symptoms, and they missed their family holiday reunion in Florida. She tested positive during those days, but the isolation period ended just in time for the couple—both fully vaccinated and boostered, she said—to catch the famous fireworks show at Disney World's Magic Kingdom Park on New Year's Eve.</p><p>\"We had had Covid,\" she said, \"and didn't have to worry as much about contracting it.\"</p><p>Packed among unmasked parkgoers—Disney World's website says face coverings are optional outdoors—Ms. Marquette was happy she'd had Covid. They wore masks in crowded areas, like when watching the fireworks. But in the 80-degree heat, the couple went maskless in less crowded areas, something they wouldn't have done last year.</p><p>\"It was just a relief to know we had it because we were pretty much guaranteed to get it there,\" said Ms. Marquette, who co-runs an Instagram account focused on post-Covid travel and inspiration. She now plans to travel to Cancún, Mexico, for a February wedding.</p><p>That post-Covid feeling of security isn't unfounded, said Edward Walsh, professor of medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center and head of infectious diseases at Rochester General Hospital. Those who safely recover, he said, are better positioned to fight new infections.</p><p>A lot can vary from person to person, he said. \"I would tell somebody, 'Well, you've been vaccinated and you had Omicron and you did well, so you're probably in even better shape to resist not just Omicron but any new variant,' \" he said. \"But we can't guarantee it, of course, because we don't know what will come along.\"</p><p>New laboratory results suggest Omicron will result in milder illness.</p><p>Still, the emotional roller coaster after exposure, testing and isolation—and two years of uncertainty—can make even the smallest joy a thrill: a museum date, a drink at the bar, a night out with friends.</p><p>For Alyssa Horowitz, a 27-year-old marketing account executive in New York City who said she is fully vaccinated and boosted, that joy is going to the movies.</p><p>She comes from a movie-loving family that has found some pandemic workarounds—none of which felt quite the same for her. When Marvel's \"Black Widow\" began streaming in July, her brother bought movie-theater popcorn and giant-sized candy, dimming the home lights to replicated the theater experience.</p><p>Her father wasn't about to ruin his record of never having never missed a James Bond movie in theaters since he was 15. He bought three cinema seats—one to sit in, two as buffers—so he could feel safer seeing \"No Time to Die\" in all its silver-screen glory.</p><p>Ms. Horowitz avoided theaters for two years. She is a huge Marvel fan, and missing new releases stung during the pandemic's darkest days.</p><p>After suffering a mild case of Omicron over the holiday season, she finally feels safe with her plans to see \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" in full silver-screen glory.</p><p>\"The popcorn is better, the soda is better—everything is better,\" Ms. Horowitz said. \"There's something about leaving your house and taking the time, as opposed to laying on the couch and saying, 'What can I stream right now?' \"</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week updated its guidance, recommending 10 days' isolation for those with symptoms and five days for those who remain asymptomatic or whose symptoms are resolving if they wear masks for the next five days.</p><p>Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said vaccination and boosters will continue to ensure that those who test positive will resist severe illness and hospitalization, but that protection wanes over time.</p><p>\"People should be cautious,\" she said, \"about having this sense of 'I'm now clear forever.' \"</p><p>Emile Panerio, a 30-year-old bartender and musician, said he and his girlfriend celebrated New Year's Eve with a quiet restaurant dinner and low-key night on the town after testing positive and going under quarantine.</p><p>\"Both of us were so ready to get out of the house and do something,\" said Mr. Panerio, who said he is fully vaccinated and boosted and had previously tested positive for Omicron. \"Whether or not we were consciously feeling more invincible, I don't know. It was like 'We can do this now.' \"</p><p>Lisa Gruber, who works in public relations in Midtown Manhattan, said her 10-day quarantine consisted of sleeping, bingeing television series and missing her best friend.</p><p>As soon as her quarantine ended Jan. 6, she went dinosaur-gazing with her friend and her friend's 5-year-old son at the Museum of Natural History—all masked—followed by a meal at a Thai restaurant. She is fully vaccinated and has had her booster, she said.</p><p>\"It was so exciting to be with people,\" said Ms. Gruber, 38, \"not sitting at my coffee table—to just hang out with the people you love.\"</p><p>Ms. Horowitz said she's planning to pursue something else the pandemic put on hold: romance. \"I feel like in the next few months I'll feel better about going on first dates with people I might have met online,\" she said.</p><p>She might even meet someone of her own post-Covid status: \"My chances are pretty high.\"</p><p>Write to Julia Carpenter at Julia.Carpenter@wsj.com and Alex Janin at Alex.Janin@wsj.com</p><p>After Getting Omicron, People Live It Up a Little.
