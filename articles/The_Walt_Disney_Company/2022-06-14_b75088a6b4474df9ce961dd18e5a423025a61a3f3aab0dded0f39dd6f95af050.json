  "title": "Disney Loses Rights to Indian Cricket --- Viacom18 partnership wins bid to stream matches from nation's popular Premier League",
  "text": "<p>The league's governing body, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, is running a multiday online auction for media rights. Two of the four packages of rights on offer -- one for Indian TV rights and the other for streaming rights -- have concluded, and the combined final price for both packages was more than $5.5 billion, the BCCI said.</p><p>Both packages give the winning bidder the right to air IPL matches for the next five years. The BCCI declined to comment on who has won the auctions. The Times of India earlier reported Viacom18 had won the IPL streaming rights.</p><p>The previous time IPL rights were auctioned was in 2017, when media conglomerate Star India, then majority-owned by 21st Century Fox, paid about $2.2 billion for both broadcast and streaming rights. As cricket has surged in popularity -- especially the IPL, which features shorter, more TV-friendly matches than other competitions -- the price of the rights has risen. Disney acquired broadcast and streaming rights in 2019 as part of its $72 billion deal for certain 21st Century Fox entertainment assets, including Star.</p><p>Disney bid on the broadcast rights as well, people familiar with the matter said. As of Monday, it wasn't known who had emerged as the winner.</p><p>Disney has set a goal of signing up between 230 million and 260 million global subscribers to its flagship Disney+ streaming service by the end of fiscal 2024.</p><p>In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Disney said that it has 50.1 million Indian Disney+ subscribers -- around 36% of its total user base of 137.7 million -- and that half of its quarterly subscriber growth came from India, where viewers signed up to watch the IPL's two-month long season.</p><p>Some analysts say that without IPL matches on the platform, Disney+ could lose tens of millions of Indian subscribers, which could make it harder for the company to reach its subscriptions target. Disney chief executive Bob Chapek, however, said on a recent earnings call that the target was still achievable even without IPL, and that cricket wasn't critical to reaching the goal.</p><p>Disney+ subscribers in India produce 76 cents a month on average in revenue, less than one-eighth the level of revenue they produce in North American markets. Disney has reported in financial filings that its Indian subscriptions are a drag on overall revenue for its streaming business.</p><p>Bidding for Indian Premier League rights had become highly competitive in recent months, with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube unit, Amazon.com Inc., and Sony Pictures Networks India in the mix at various moments, along with Disney and Viacom18, according to the BCCI.</p>",
