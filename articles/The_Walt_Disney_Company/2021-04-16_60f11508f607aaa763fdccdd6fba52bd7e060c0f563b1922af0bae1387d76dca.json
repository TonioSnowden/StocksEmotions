  "text": "<p>   LOS ANGELES -- Nicole DeGraaf was several episodes into the TV show \"Felicity\" this week when friends grew concerned about her. \"Are you OK?\" several texted. </p><p>   News was spreading in the nation's filmmaking capital that Hollywood's unofficial theater chain, the ArcLight, wouldn't be reopening its auditoriums when the pandemic ended. Ms. DeGraaf, a hard-core movie lover in a city full of them, was still processing the revelation. </p><p>   \"It's like someone was saying your second home is closing forever,\" said Ms. DeGraaf, a 42-year-old Los Angeles native who lost her job as a salon manager when Covid-19 forced the shop to close. </p><p>   Similar scenes are playing out across America. As the nation reemerges from 14 months of shutdowns, beloved diners, music venues and other community landmarks are informing customers that there will be no life after the pandemic. Few notices have rippled through Los Angeles like the announcement Monday that the screens operated by ArcLight Cinemas would be among them. The ArcLight, and in particular its flagship location on Sunset Boulevard, doubled as a Kiwanis Club for cinephiles, its lobby a celebrity-filled haven and its auditoriums marked by a quiet, almost religious, reverence. </p><p>   When it opened in 2002, the ArcLight was among the first in the nation to offer assigned seating. Earnest ushers -- their own favorite movies featured on their nametags -- introduced each movie by identifying its director and running time. Each month featured Q&amp;A sessions with filmmakers after the show. In the lobbies, costumes from blockbusters like \"The Avengers\" were often on display, not far from a cafe and restaurant. </p><p>   Next door to the ArcLight's flagship location is the Cinerama Dome, a single-screen orb that the chain operated and had screened such epics as \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" The 58-year-old theater could seat more than 800 moviegoers and often dressed the part, getting covered in yellow tarp for the opening of a new \"Minions\" movie. It was seen in Technicolor glory in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 ode to midcentury Los Angeles, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" It, too, will close, the chain announced. </p><p>   \"Yet another L.A. temple or cathedral to movies that's fading away,\" said Charles de Lauzirika, a filmmaker whose first visit to the Cinerama Dome was as a young boy for a rerelease of Disney's \"Fantasia.\" Its closure is a sign of the times, he said, \"and the times have sucked.\" </p><p>   The 300 screens operated by ArcLight parent company Pacific Theaters compose a fraction of the 41,000 operating before the pandemic, but they loom large in the home of Hollywood. These ArcLight-branded multiplexes were a film geek's paradise, also defined by what they didn't offer -- sticky floors, bad lighting -- and didn't tolerate: talking or texting during the show and tardy arrivals. </p><p>   \"Not letting people in late, what a dream!\" Ms. DeGraaf said. </p><p>   There are other theaters in Los Angeles, of course, whether those operated by major chains or boutique operators that specialize in luxury food and special seating. But Ms. DeGraaf's experiences at the big chains, when she must attend them, are characterized by \"20 minutes of commercials with the lights on,\" she said, and at fancier auditoriums by a constant flow of servers delivering cocktails. \"Which is great for people who don't care about movies,\" she said. </p><p>   Pacific Theaters said in a statement: \"This was not the outcome anyone wanted, but despite a huge effort that exhausted all potential options, the company does not have a viable way forward.\" </p><p>   News of its closure sent film fans into a citywide shiva, with filmmakers like Rian Johnson and Barry Jenkins joining the commiseration. \"Nooooooooooooooooooooooo,\" wrote actress and director Olivia Wilde. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Michael Horton, a 35-year-old TV researcher and writer, marked the sad occasion. He loaded CineStill 50 film into his camera and drove to the Cinerama Dome, Located less than 5 miles south of the Hollywood sign, it was where Mr. Horton saw \"Men in Black\" as a child. The Dome he photographed this week, though, looked much different than it did back then. Plywood covered the doors. The only people outside were cleaning the sidewalk. </p><p>   As he took in the scene, Mr. Horton sounded like a man older than his 35 years as he recalled the old days. \"So much movie culture is leaving Hollywood,\" he said. </p><p>   The ArcLight was one of the few places where moviegoers have a chance at a celebrity sighting, and where stars were left largely alone. Mr. Lauzirika saw \"Back to the Future\" sitting next to Thomas F. Wilson, who played the bully Biff in the movie. Ms. DeGraaf speaks in awe of watching Keanu Reeves whip off his motorcycle helmet at the ArcLight bar \"like it was in slow-motion.\" </p><p>   The ArcLight was also a gathering spot for the less celebrated in a city that can feel atomized. \"You run into people you know, you run into people you don't want to run into,\" said Peter Avellino, a 49-year-old ArcLight devotee. </p><p>   When Lee Trovillion, 35, a production company manager, moved to Los Angeles in 2008, film-school buddies told him he would be spending a lot of time at the ArcLight. Now, he is heartbroken to think that the disappointing 2019 release \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" will be the last one he sees in an ArcLight auditorium. </p><p></p>",
