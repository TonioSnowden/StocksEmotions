  "text": "<p>In Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel <em>The Road</em>, ash falls continually from a sky darkened by nuclear winter. Last week, ash fell for three days into the pool of the Tuscan house I'd rented with American friends from London as part of a long delayed post-pandemic holiday — that unfortunately coincided with a record European heatwave and wildfires near our rental. With temperatures hovering around 40C and enough smoke to necessitate masks, it was time to cut the vacation short. </p> <p>Is this the future of holiday making amid climate change? Quite possibly. One could argue that Italy in late summer is a bad idea. But we wouldn't have fared any better in California, where heat-induced fires also raged, or in China, where thousands were displaced by flash floods, or even back home in New York, where city officials told citizens to unplug appliances and warned against blasting the air-conditioning in order to prevent the overwhelmed utility grid from collapsing. Police in my hometown, like many in the US, are bracing for more violent crime, which correlates with heatwaves.</p> <p>Both temperatures and tempers flared during my brief holiday, and not only because our host insisted on no air-con — “You are just fuelling Putin's war,” he said, which is true enough. My ex-pat friends were furious about the recent Supreme Court decision that curbed the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to enforce clean energy and environmental safety rules. The consensus in our group was that West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, despite his recent last-minute compromises on climate spending, should be forced to vacation in Death Valley for a week with nothing but one of those tiny handheld fans. &#xa0;</p> <p>Climate change is of course no laughing matter. If America can't make significant progress on the issue, I suspect that it will be for the Biden administration what the financial crisis was for the Obama administration — the policy failure that creates a negative domino effect for years to come. Barack Obama entered office with ambitions to fix everything from the American healthcare system to income inequality. But the sense that his administration had failed to bail out homeowners during the subprime crisis, as the largest banks grew bigger and richer, created a sense of disenchantment (particularly among the labour left) that ultimately crippled his ability to do much else.</p> <p>Certainly, Manchin's recent capitulation on the White House spending bill is a win for the Biden administration. (In my <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/279e6b34-dc26-448b-bc8c-2928317c5d4c\">column today</a>, I explore the economic ramifications of this, as well as the Chips bill). But the president is fighting against other priorities and headwinds. Consider, for example, how the current energy crisis has pushed the US back into relation with the Saudi government. While the Biden administration has reaffirmed an alliance, it hasn't yet got any particular commitments on oil. It will be tough for the US to position its foreign policy as being based on “values” — particularly in comparison to China — when Biden is meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government is responsible for any number of human rights atrocities.</p> <p>One can argue, of course, that endeavouring to stabilise global energy markets amid the war in Ukraine necessitates such compromise. But even if the Saudis manage to pump more oil in the short term, their oil output is near its ceiling. In fact, they are themselves importing more Russian fuel oil for power generation. Putin has the leverage; the only way to decrease it is to move as quickly as possible to a clean energy future.</p> <p>It's a circular conundrum that makes one wonder where we might find high ground or cool temperatures. Certainly not in the south and the west of the US, where red states including Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Missouri are battling intense heat and drought that will probably curb production of cash crops such as corn and soyabeans. In turn, this will only push food inflation higher, and add fuel to the fire (pardon the pun) of all the issues I've laid out above.</p> <p>Ed, I know you've been sceptical about Biden's ability to make good on any major climate commitments. What have the events of the last few days done to change your view (or not) on that issue? </p> <p><em>Note to readers: Swamp Notes is taking a short break.

When I told inquiring American friends where I'd picked it up, they laughed and said, “no seriously, where did you get it?” England, I repeated. Of course, global warming is no laughing matter, though the excellent quality of Sussex champagne nowadays occasionally leaves me feeling ambivalent. </p> <p>I would say that the meteorological changes that I have observed in my lifetime (at the home north of Brighton to which my parents moved when I was four) have been dramatic. But that would be an understatement. They have been dramatic within my 15-year-old daughter's span. I overheard her the other day telling a friend: “It's always sunny in England”. The 110-degree Fahrenheit heat we had in mid-July reminded me of that crushing feeling in New Delhi summers when you wander outside. Within a few years the UK will be air-conditioned, which will not help matters. But people have to be able to sleep at night. </p> <p> As regards Biden and Manchin, the budget compromise has been a pleasant surprise, though I won't relax until it has been passed. It will go some, if not most, of the way to fulfilling America's 2030 carbon reduction targets. For all of the Manchin exasperations, I cannot help wondering what the world would be like if the Republican Party acknowledged global warming as a transcending challenge. It seems almost fanciful to suggest it. Yet as recently as 2008, the Republican&#xa0;presidential nominee, John McCain, made tackling climate change a centrepiece of his campaign. The GOP's degeneration into the party of rearguard fossil fuel worship is a tragedy of gross moral negligence. It is also another of the American right's deepening affinities with Putin's Russia. We may look back on the Ukraine war not as the last of the 20th century land wars but as the first in which our fossil fuel addiction was critical to the outcome. </p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ace41d28-8ec7-494b-832d-1e1b51a305ba\"><strong>Biden's Lazarus-like opportunity</strong></a><strong>': <br></strong>“Completely agree that we should await the beginning of the presidential primary process to see who should be the 2024 presidential candidate. The Biden administration includes possibly the finest cabinet in recent memory, one capable of leading the US into the future rather than back into the past and more crony capitalism. If Biden keeps batting, he will get some hits.” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ace41d28-8ec7-494b-832d-1e1b51a305ba?commentID=7fd52942-5889-425a-bd44-c5423b1c3aa3\"><em>— Paul A Meyers</em></a></p><p>Source: Rana Foroohar  2022 'Vacation apocalypse' FT.com 1 August.
