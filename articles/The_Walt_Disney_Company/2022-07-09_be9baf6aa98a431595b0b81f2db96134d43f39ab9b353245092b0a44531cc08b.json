  "text": "<ol>  <li><p><strong>What is your earliest memory?</strong><br>Sitting in the garden, aged two or three, pulling off the little pointy hats on California poppy buds and watching them unfurl. It was like magic. And being on my father's shoulders, feeling his glossy bald head under my chin. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Who was or still is your mentor?</strong> <br>Thanks to Harold Pinter, the first person who believed in me as an actor, I'll say Lindsay Duncan. We worked together, with Harold directing, at the Almeida Theatre, doing <em>Celebration</em>, then went to New York. We then shot <em>Rome</em> for HBO, in Rome, and we shared a flat. I have learnt so much from her, both as an actor and a human being. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>How fit are you?</strong><br>I'm very competitive and I love to move. I push myself. I also love to eat and cook. It's a balance between being fit and being a gourmand. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Tell me about an animal you have loved.</strong><br>My first rabbit, Janet. Then my daughter's guinea pig, Cucumber. I would copy her whistle to summon her. Now, Piper the cocker spaniel. Nora Ephron said everyone should get a dog when their kids become teenagers, for some unconditional love. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Risk or caution, which has defined your life more?</strong><br>My youth was risk, and I still like to push my luck. As a teenager I used to get myself into sticky situations. Stranded in Milan, I asked a stranger if I could stay the night and if he could pay for my train ticket to his house. His parents were initially appalled, then so hospitable and welcoming. I'm eternally grateful. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>What trait do you find most irritating in others?</strong><br>Absolutism. Lack of empathy. Not seeing the other side. Unfortunately, social media are so polarising. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>What trait do you find most irritating in yourself?</strong><br>Not being able to say no. Not being able to make my mind up. Not being able to relax. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>What drives you on?</strong><br>My inability to say no, my competitive spirit, my fear of missing out. I love being involved in whatever game is going on, though I'm not bothered about winning. I'm a good loser. I have a quest to be more present and more courageous. I want to share beauty, in all its guises. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife?</strong><br>When my father died, I continued to feel his presence. He lives on in spirit. I hear him commenting on my life and I see him in my relationship with my daughter. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Which is more puzzling, the existence of suffering or its frequent absence?</strong><br>When we suffer, we go into survival mode; we evolve. Hope exists within suffering. An absence of suffering . . . doesn't that make us complacent and potentially atrophy?</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Name your favourite river.</strong><br>The Narmada in India, the lifeline of Madhya Pradesh, where we took my dad's ashes. And, for the joy of rivers, as a child on holiday in Tuscany, one where you could wade and swim, with rocks to jump off. It was the first time I had seen a water snake. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>What would you have done differently?</strong><br>If I'd done things differently, would I be who I am now? Probably not. I wish I had believed a little more in myself. I took a few risks in my twenties and I wish I'd taken more. </p></li> </ol> <p><em>Indira Varma stars in ‘The Seagull' at the Harold Pinter Theatre, London, running until September 10, and in ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi' on Disney+</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Hester Lacey 2022 'Indira Varma: ‘When we suffer, we go into survival mode'' FT.com 9 July.
