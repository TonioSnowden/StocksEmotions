  "text": "<p>The confusion over Omicron is just one of many for travelers.</p><p>Certain destinations now require children to be vaccinated to access indoor venues, and others require time-sensitive Covid-19 tests. Some locations expect neither.</p><p>For those traveling, this means the requirements on each trip will change, not just based on where you go but who you go with. Travel advisers say the most important thing you can do is be proactive and check local guidelines frequently.</p><p>\"You really have to pre-plan everything now,\" says Susan Peavey, owner of Susan Peavey Travel in Marshfield, Mass.</p><p>In the short term, the biggest changes are the rules on predeparture Covid-19 testing, says Diane Sherer, owner and founder of Beyond Traveled , based in Los Angeles.</p><p>The U.S. now requires international air travelers, including its citizens, to have a negative Covid-19 test within a day of departure to the U.S., regardless of vaccination status. The U.K.—where public-health officials estimated Omicron cases are doubling faster than every two days—is requiring tests both before departure and after arrival. France requires a negative Covid-19 test taken within 48 hours of departure for travelers arriving from outside the European Union, including those who are fully vaccinated. On Thursday, it said it will restrict tourist arrivals from the U.K. starting Saturday.</p><p>The changing requirements are creating headaches for travelers. For Dylan Kroll and his wife, Brittney, the 48-hour countdown clock for France began as they walked down the aisle at their wedding last Saturday.</p><p>The pair searched around the Tampa Bay metro area to find a suitable testing location in the days leading up to the wedding. They ended up finding one that was open on Sunday and could deliver rapid test results ahead of their Monday flight.</p><p>Mr. Kroll says he wondered if the restrictions were worth the added stress. The pair considered postponing the honeymoon, but ultimately decided to forge ahead.</p><p>\"When else will it actually feel like the honeymoon than right after the wedding?\" he says.</p><p>Other popular destinations, including Mexico, have asked much less of U.S. travelers. Mexico doesn't require a pre-departure Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination for entry, though air travelers must provide a negative test to return to the U.S.</p><p>Another complication: Compared with earlier in the year, when many countries remained closed to tourists, borders have largely remained open to U.S. travelers in recent weeks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to add to the list of foreign countries it advises Americans to avoid.</p><p>The rules range widely within the U.S., too. California now requires masking in public indoor settings regardless of vaccination status. New York City requires kids 5 to 11 to show proof of one vaccination dose for indoor dining, fitness, entertainment and performance venues.</p><p>The Delta variant has fueled case and hospitalization surges in parts of the country including the Northeast and Midwest, and the Omicron variant is gaining ground.</p><p>Cruise lines have taken a range of approaches to requiring vaccines for children. Beginning Jan. 13, Disney Cruise Line will require passengers 5 and older to show proof of vaccination against Covid-19. Royal Caribbean requires passengers 12 and older to show proof of vaccination, and says vaccination is recommended, but not required, for children 11 and under. The cruise line says on its website unvaccinated kids under age 12 must complete additional testing requirements.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How are you adjusting to changing rules and requirements as you make travel plans? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Jasmin Samlal, a travel adviser based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has been fielding questions from clients who are confused about Covid-19 tests and cruising. Those who are taking European river cruises need to plan to get a negative test before returning to the U.S. by plane. But those returning via a seaport don't need a negative test to re-enter the country.</p><p>The CDC requires vaccinated cruise passengers to take a Covid-19 test no more than two days before boarding a ship in the U.S. Unlike with air travelers, vaccinated cruise passengers don't need to present a negative test taken within one day prior to returning to the U.S. The order doesn't apply to passengers arriving at seaports.</p><p>Whether someone chooses to travel now depends on their comfort level, Ms. Sherer says.</p><p>\"Complication doesn't mean impossibility. It means dot your i's and cross your t's and let's go,\" she says.</p><p>Write to Allison Pohle at Allison.Pohle@wsj.com</p><p>The First Rule of Pandemic Travel Is Read Everything About Local Laws—Twice</p>",
