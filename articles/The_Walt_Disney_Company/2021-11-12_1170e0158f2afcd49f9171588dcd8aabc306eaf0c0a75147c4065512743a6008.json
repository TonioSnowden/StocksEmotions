  "title": "General Electric, Tesla, Disney: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>Tesla Inc.</p><p>Elon Musk has a new adviser: Twitter. The Tesla boss pledged to unload 10% of his stockholdings after polling users on the social-media platform. \"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,\" the Tesla chief executive said on Twitter on Nov. 6, adding, \"I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.\" Voters backed the share sale by a wide margin, with roughly 58% in favor of a sale and 42% opposed after more than 3.5 million votes were cast. Since then, Mr. Musk has made a string of stock sales worth more than $5 billion. Tesla shares fell 4.8% Monday.</p><p>Hershey Co.</p><p>Hershey is trying to create a classic combination: salty and sweet. The candy maker plans to spend $1.2 billion to buy Dot's Homestyle Pretzels and Pretzels Inc. The two acquisitions aim to expand Hershey's growing lineup of salty snacks, which includes SkinnyPop popcorn and Pirate's Booty cheese puffs. Chief Executive Michele Buck said the pretzel deals are the next step in Hershey's vision to become a snacking behemoth. In recent years, the Hershey, Pa.-based company has worked to diversify its business beyond candy and chocolate as shoppers lean toward healthier snacks. Hershey shares rose 1.9% Wednesday.</p><p>Rivian Automotive Inc.</p><p>Rivian made a supercharged market debut. The electric-vehicle startup raised $11.9 billion in its initial offering—more than any other U.S. listing since 2014—thanks to investor excitement over electric-car companies. Wednesday's closing price gave Rivian a valuation of roughly $86 billion, more than Ford Motor Co.'s market value and about on par with that of General Motors Co. Rivian's valuation illustrates optimism around the car market's shift to vehicles that run on electricity rather than gasoline. The global auto industry has sharply pivoted to electric vehicles in recent years, amid stricter emissions regulations and some governments' plans to phase out gasoline-engine vehicles. Rivian shares jumped 29% Wednesday.</p><p>Walt Disney Co.</p><p>Can the Beatles and a new \"Home Alone\" bring more eyes to Disney+? Walt Disney on Wednesday posted a significant slowdown in the streaming service's subscriber growth as pandemic-related lockdowns eased. The lag ends two years of strong growth that helped the entertainment giant survive Covid-19 and expand its media dominance into the home. Meanwhile, Covid-related production delays are wreaking havoc on its release schedule, and the pace of new content isn't expected to rebound until the second half of 2022. To lure subscribers to Disney+, the company in November and December will rely on a Beatles documentary, additional Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm Ltd. shows and films that include a new \"Home Alone\" feature. Disney shares lost 7.1% Thursday.</p><p>Beyond Meat Inc.</p><p>Investors are losing their appetite for Beyond Meat. The plant-based meat company on Wednesday posted a disappointing revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, citing pandemic-related uncertainty and its possible impact on retail and food-service demand. Chief Executive Ethan Brown said as the summer wore on and the pandemic's Delta variant took hold, Beyond Meat didn't see the sustained recovery it expected. The company couldn't fill some orders due to labor shortages, Mr. Brown said. He also cited severe weather in Pennsylvania and an explosion at one of the company's key suppliers. Beyond Meat shares plummeted 13% Thursday.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson</p><p>Band-Aids and prescription drugs will no longer have the same home at Johnson &amp; Johnson. The 135-year-old company plans to break up into two public companies, splitting off the $15-billion-a-year division that sells bandages, Tylenol medicines and Johnson's Baby Powder. The world's largest health-products company by sales will separate its high-margin but less predictable prescription-drug and medical-device business from the storied but slower-growing consumer group. J&amp;J will shed its consumer division in 18 to 24 months. Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said the company decided to make the change because the businesses, their customers and markets have diverged so much in recent years, including during the pandemic. J&amp;J shares rose 1.2% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>General Electric, Tesla, Disney: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
