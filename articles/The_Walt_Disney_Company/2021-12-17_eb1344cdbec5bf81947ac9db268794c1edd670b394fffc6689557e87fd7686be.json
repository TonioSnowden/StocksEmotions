  "title": "How Four Families Are Budgeting for Their Second Pandemic Holiday Season; Homemade gifts and shorter lists are among the measures Americans are using to deal with hardship—or maintain financial momentum into the new year",
  "text": "<p>Americans are sitting on cash, watching 401(k) balances rise, starting millions of new businesses, and enjoying their pick of jobs.</p><p>But they are also contending with higher prices for everything from homes to cars to food. There remain ongoing health concerns. Nearly 40% of U.S. households indicated in a recent poll by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and National Public Radio that they faced serious financial difficulties in recent months, including paying utility bills or credit card debt. About one-fifth said they have depleted all of their savings.</p><p>Heading into the holidays, The Wall Street Journal spoke to four people about their families' daily lives and short- and long-term plans this holiday season.</p><p>Ashley Rose Paredes is aiming to celebrate Christmas without sacrificing the financial freedom she gained this year.</p><p>Months of student-loan payment deferrals have helped her pay down about $5,000 in credit-card debt in roughly the past 12 months. The 31-year-old also created an emergency fund of about $15,000.</p><p>While she still has about $60,000 in federal student loans, the Covid-19 pause in payments helped her to become more financially stable.</p><p>\"Not having to pay my loans has helped me work toward some of my other goals,\" Ms. Paredes said.</p><p>During the pandemic, the Orange, N.J., resident has stayed home with her daughter, Maui, now 19 months old. For some of that time, she has spent about 20 hours a week working from home as a freelance customer-service agent, making as much as $17 an hour.</p><p>Ms. Paredes cut her holiday budget to about $500 from about $1,500 last year. She's creating handmade gifts for the 10 people on her Christmas list; last year she spent around $50 each on store-bought presents.</p><p>She says she'll buy a practical gift such as work boots for her partner, C.J. Perrin. The bulk of her spending will go toward gifts for Maui, including a toy kitchen and Minnie Mouse trampoline she found on sale.</p><p>On Christmas morning, Ms. Paredes plans to host Mr. Perrin's parents for a homemade breakfast including eggs, bacon, shrimp and cheese grits.</p><p>Ms. Paredes is paying for all of her gifts with one credit card that has no other charges, so she can easily track her spending and pay off the charges before the new year begins.</p><p>\"I want to be financially free,\" she said.</p><p>Mr. Perrin, 31, who lost his job working at a small restaurant at the start of the pandemic, switched industries and now works in a United Parcel Service Inc. warehouse, where he earns about $20 an hour, significantly more than he made at the restaurant. The new job's reliable hours allow him to save and spend more time with his family.</p><p>The owner of a family-run business, Sarita Parikh says the holiday season is \"pretty insane.\"</p><p>\"There are nights when I don't sleep at all,\" said Ms. Parikh, co-founder of Glow + Gather, a Castle Rock, Colo., retailer of moisturizers and spice blends.</p><p>Ms. Parikh, 46, started the company in 2017 at the urging of her niece Kerala Parikh, now 15, and nephew Jaxon Parikh, now 12, after making a moisturizer from natural butters and oils for Kerala's sensitive skin.</p><p>Today, the trio are partners, with Kerala overseeing the self-care products and Jax in charge of spice mixes that include garam masala and caprese French gray sea salt.</p><p>On weekends in November and December, they rent booths at holiday markets.</p><p>The family had hoped 2021 would bring a return to pre-pandemic business conditions. But while sales are up 30% this year compared to 2020, jar shortages and rising costs for shipping, tins and ingredients have reduced profits, said Ms. Parikh. She has raised prices on some items, but not enough to fully offset the higher costs.</p><p>\"Jars I ordered six months ago still haven't come in. Who knows where they are?\" said Ms. Parikh, who used cash earmarked for a website redesign to purchase substitute jars in greater quantities than the business is likely to need so it won't get caught short. The boxes fill her garage and second bedroom.</p><p>The company is sticking with a pledge to double contributions of nonperishable food and other necessities, from one to two items for each post-Thanksgiving sale, to a shelter for domestic violence survivors. But Ms. Parikh is reducing her personal holiday spending.</p><p>In pre-pandemic times, she helped host a party celebrating Diwali, the Indian festival of lights, for about 180 friends, relatives, and business contacts. Ms. Parikh's co-hosts were her brother, Sagar, 42, and sister-in-law, Angela, 44—Jax and Kerala's parents.</p><p>This year, due to Covid concerns, the family invited about 60 guests to the party, which featured Glow + Gather candles and spices. It cost about $500, or half the pre-pandemic norm, said Angela, who oversees the company's label design and holiday market displays.</p><p>After the holidays, the Glow + Gather team reward themselves with a trip. In 2019, they spent a day at Devil's Thumb Ranch, a resort in Tabernash, Colo., where for about $800 they rented a horse-drawn sleigh and had dinner and drinks before driving home. Under consideration this year is two nights at a cabin in the mountains that costs about $130 a night.</p><p>The family plans to spend Christmas at Angela and Sagar's home in Littleton, Colo., where their tradition is to eat pumpkin pie for breakfast and a traditional Indian meal for lunch. A faux-snowball fight with balled up wrapping paper usually follows the gift opening.</p><p>Ms. Parikh has pared her gift list to 12 friends and relatives, down from 25 in 2019. She plans to spend about $300 on gifts bought from local businesses and \"curate gifts with the intent that they have meaning behind them versus a dollar amount.\"</p><p>In the Federici household, a holiday trip has been the tradition in recent years.</p><p>In the past, the family often spent part of the holiday season in the car, driving to visit relatives. The children typically amused themselves on their phones, said Barry Federici, 55, a Marine Corps colonel-turned-financial planner who was mobilized five times to serve in the Middle East between 2002 and 2015, including three tours in Afghanistan.</p><p>In contrast, Mr. Federici said, when traveling \"everyone is focused on being together and enjoying each other's company.\"</p><p>The travel tradition started in 2015 when Mr. Federici and his wife, Dr. Karen Federici, 54, took their four children, then ages 10 to 19, to Walt Disney World. This year, the family plans to visit Playa del Carmen, Mexico, for eight days.</p><p>With three of the couple's children now living away from their family home in DeKalb, Ill., he added, \"We don't see them a lot.\"</p><p>Kayla, 25, works for TikTok in Chicago, where she shares an apartment with friends and travels frequently. Alexander, 21, and Grace, 19, attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where they major in computer science and engineering, respectively. Tessa, 16, lives at home but is often busy with friends, school work, and \"that phone,\" said her father.</p><p>The price tag for this year's trip to the Mexican coastal resort town: $9,000, including airfare, boarding for their dog, meals and two suites at the beachfront Playacar Palace.</p><p>That is more than triple the $2,400 they spent last year on a trip to a ski resort near Lake Michigan, where they stayed at an Airbnb, and $1,000 more than Mr. Federici had expected to spend.</p><p>The family's six-figure income declined by about 30% in 2020, due in part to the impact of Covid-related lockdowns on Dr. Federici's primary-care medical practice. Mr. Federici said the couple was able to get by with savings.</p><p>The upside to the lockdowns, he said, was that their three older children moved home for a few months. \"We had cooking contests and played games,\" he recalled. \"I really enjoyed it.\"</p><p>This past January, Mr. Federici started working full time at his wealth-management firm, located in a building he and his wife own that also houses her medical practice.</p><p>His firm, Family First Wealth Management LLC, has about 10 clients; he hopes to add another 30.</p><p>On Christmas Day, the Federicis plan to give their children stocking stuffers on the beach, though the vacation is their main gift.</p><p>At home, daughter Kayla Federici said, \"It's hard to get everyone in one spot\"—one person is showering while another runs out to meet friends. On vacation, by contrast, the whole family is together, eating, drinking and doing activities, she said: \"I look forward to it all year.\"</p><p>This year's Christmas celebration on Lara Richardson's family farm will be much leaner than last.</p><p>Amid challenges keeping their new family farm running, Ms. Richardson said the family plans to spend a total of about $1,500 on gifts and a tree, compared with roughly $3,500 last year. They'll celebrate the holiday at home with meat and vegetables grown on their own farm. They may spend about $75 on sweets and spirits.</p><p>The financial burden of running the farm means the family has higher priorities than its holiday budget, she said: \"Christmas doesn't matter so much when there are more important things on the line.\"</p><p>In March of 2019, Ms. Richardson, now 41 years old, her partner, Joel Francois, now 45, and their then year-old daughter, Leonie, left New York City in search of a lifestyle she hoped would be healthier for her family. The family now includes a baby boy, Olivier, born last month.</p><p>They drove to Central Point, Ore., where about four years ago she bought a 40-acre organic farm with her mother and brother for roughly $675,000. They hired a farm hand to start a hemp crop for producing CBD, a nonintoxicating compound found in cannabis.</p><p>The family has poured about $1 million into improvements on the farm, including a new agriculture building and fencing, she said. Most of the farm's debt, about $600,000, is in Ms. Richardson's name.</p><p>Ms. Richardson earned a six-figure income as a catering-company sales executive in New York. She lost her job during the pandemic and currently has no salary.</p><p>\"That debt-to-income ratio is soul-crushing,\" said Ms. Richardson, who used much of her savings to purchase Lane Creek Reserve, as the farm is known.</p><p>The family purchased the farm as an investment. But soon after Covid struck they lost their biggest CBD account—a brand that sold to brick-and-mortar retailers that didn't have an online store. They have stopped producing CBD, which Ms. Richardson called an expensive undertaking, with steep competition from larger growers.</p><p>They have let their farm manager go, saving about $36,000 a year, and stopped operating the farm's Airbnb mobile home, which brought in $120 a night, on average, when Ms. Richardson's 70-year-old mother moved in. Campers who use the property can spend time with the farm's 17 cows, 14 sheep and assorted other animals. They pay about $45 a night, on average.</p><p>Ms. Richardson's brother, Daniel Richardson, and their mother, Joan Seivert, have lived on the farm since purchasing it in 2017.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How has your holiday budget changed this year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Francois's job as a warehouse manager, where he makes about $50,000 a year, and her brother's work as a land surveyor, where he makes about $40,000 a year, cover most of the $6,000 a month, including mortgage payments, it costs to maintain the farm. Selling eggs from their roughly 85 chickens generates additional pocket money.</p><p>Last month, Ms. Richardson sold 15 goats, partly because the rising price of hay made them too costly to keep. She is considering selling some of the cows if the family's fortunes don't improve soon.</p><p>She recently called a family meeting to see where they could further cut expenses and how long they can realistically keep the farm in which they have invested much time and money. But with three car payments, utilities, cellphones, feed and debt repayment, the family isn't sure how much left they can cut, she said.</p><p>She may pick up some freelance sales work in the new year to help pay their mounting bills.</p><p>\"We have huge overhead here,\" she said, \"and are responsible for many mouths.\"</p><p>Write to Veronica Dagher and Anne Tergesen at veronica.dagher@wsj.com and anne.tergesen@wsj.com</p><p>How Four Families Are Budgeting for Their Second Pandemic Holiday Season</p>",
