  "text": "<p>   Democratic candidates in the New York City mayoral primary spent Tuesday stumping before the polls opened at 6 a.m. and ended the fast-moving day watching election results at their campaign parties. </p><p>    Kathryn Garcia joined a roll call with city sanitation workers at a Manhattan garage at 5:45 a.m. The former Department of Sanitation commissioner was given roses by the crew before she set out for campaign stops in the Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn. </p><p>   Ms. Garcia was a relative unknown when she entered the race, trailing in most polls, but she surged in the standings during the past two months after getting endorsements from the New York Times and Daily News. </p><p>   However, on Tuesday night, she was in third place in votes, according to a preliminary tally by the city's Board of Elections. She trailed Maya Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who held a strong lead over all the candidates, the tally showed. </p><p>   Earlier in the day, Mr. Adams took his 25-year-old son with him to cast his ballot at a polling location in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. </p><p>   Mr. Adams placed his son's finger on his name on the ballot before he voted. His mother did the same with him in 1977, placing his finger over the name of Percy Sutton, a Black politician who unsuccessfully ran for mayor, he said. </p><p>   Mr. Adams revealed at a news conference outside the polling site Tuesday that his mother had died two months earlier, while he was campaigning. </p><p>   \"I am a New York story,\" he said. \"This is a moment where the little guy has won. We've won already.\" </p><p>   At 6:45 a.m., Andrew Yang greeted voters at a poll site in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood and campaigned in the Bronx and Manhattan later in the day. Although he entered the race as a front-runner, boasting high name recognition after running for president, late Tuesday he conceded the race. </p><p>   Ms. Wiley, who has picked up momentum in recent weeks after winning the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other high-profile progressives, started her day with New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams at a poll site in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. She also attended events in Brooklyn and Manhattan. </p><p>   Other candidates, including New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, spent Tuesday meeting with voters at subway stations and outside polling locations. </p><p>   The city used a ranked-choice voting system for the first time in the mayoral primary and many other races. Voters could list up to five candidates in preferential order. </p><p>   In the Republican mayoral primary, Curtis Sliwa, founder of the crime-prevention group Guardian Angels, defeated Fernando Mateo, a longtime advocate for taxi drivers and bodega owners. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to prevail in the November general election. Democrats outnumber Republicans by roughly 6 to 1 in the city. </p><p>   Some candidates said they planned to spend Wednesday resting. </p><p>   Ms. Garcia said in an interview that she hopes to attend her niece's elementary school graduation at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday. </p><p>   Ms. Wiley said she planned to sleep in on Wednesday and have eggs and bacon for breakfast. </p><p>   Mr. Adams joked that he planned to go to Disney World on Wednesday before saying that he was just going to relax. </p><p>   \"I'm going to really just take a day and make some phone calls and just stay in my pajamas and really just relax and go around and thank New Yorkers for this journey,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
