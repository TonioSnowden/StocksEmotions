  "text": "<h2>Activist versus activist&#xa0;</h2> <p>If anyone on Wall Street has mastered the art of letter writing, it would be activist investor <strong>Daniel Loeb</strong>.</p> <p>Who can forget his <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/823094/000119312513388165/d605390dex993.htm\">reference</a> to auction house <strong>Sotheby's</strong> as “an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”?&#xa0;</p> <p>But the billionaire founder of the hedge fund <strong>Third Point</strong> is learning he's not the only one who knows how to wield the pen. Loeb's UK-listed vehicle <strong>Third Point Investors </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fdf1805-7305-4aeb-a23c-1c89a3550547\">come under fire</a> from its own dissatisfied investor.</p> <p><strong>Asset Value Investors</strong>, a London-based fund manager with a 10 per cent stake in TPI, this week delivered<a href=\"https://www.assetvalueinvestors.com/content/uploads/2021/05/AVI-Open-Letter-to-TPIL-Vote-Co_2.pdf\"> a scathing letter</a> to the fund, accusing Loeb of “hypocrisy,” “lack of self-awareness” and “unprofessionalism”.</p> <p>It seems AVI, when complaining about TPI's performance, has irked Loeb, who allegedly chided any shareholders “seeking to earn a quick buck by trying to bully or force the board or me to do something that isn't in the long-term interests of all of our investors”.</p> <p>Well, fancy hearing that from one of the most prolific activists on the scene.</p> <p>Let's not forget that activist hedge funds build stakes in companies and agitate for change to boost the share price (and not out of the goodness of their hearts). A criticism often levelled at activist investors is that they're trying to “earn a quick buck” as Loeb puts it.</p> <p>Putting all that aside, what AVI is complaining about is that TPI trades at a 17.5 per cent discount to the value of its holdings. That's true, but it's not the full picture. TPI shares are trading at an all-time high of $25.20. Since the lows of March last year, it's up about 144 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>The real issue seems to be that AVI wants the ability to get out of its investment in TPI and given the chance, it probably would. But that's not how these investments work.&#xa0;</p> <p>The whole reason hedge fund managers such as Loeb and <strong>Pershing Square Management</strong>'s <strong>Bill Ackman</strong> set up these vehicles was to pull in permanent capital. That means investors accept that they are locked up for several years.&#xa0;</p> <p>TPI has said it will let investors cash out through a tender offer in 2024, if the trust is still trading at a substantial discount. But it seems AVI doesn't want to have to wait that long.&#xa0;</p> <p>For any companies that are targeted by Loeb in the future, here's a line from the man himself that will come in handy: “It might be the best thing for them to move on and find other companies to invest in.”&#xa0;</p> <h2>Archegos crashes the Spac party</h2> <p>DD readers know by now that the implosion of <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>'s <strong>Archegos Capital</strong> has been felt far and wide — from banks in the US to Europe and Asia.</p> <p>And as the<strong> US Department of Justice </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/959073bf-c8d1-4044-ace2-0dd1f915a873\">begins its investigation</a> into the collapsed family office, another unexpected casualty of the fallout has emerged: special purpose acquisition companies. Ever heard of them?</p> <p>All jokes aside, banks are now becoming more wary about how much leverage they can extend to clients such as hedge funds, who are early investors in Spacs.</p> <p>A quick lesson on the hedge fund trade: managers are typically allocated shares in the Spac at $10 a piece before it is listed. Here they can use leverage from their prime brokers to buy into the company. When time comes to sell out (hopefully at a profit) they pay back what they owe and keep the returns.&#xa0;</p> <p>The strategy has proven to be a gold mine over the past year because shares in Spacs have been driven up by retail investors who can only buy into the company once it has already listed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because the cash invested in Spacs is put in a trust that earns interest and shareholders are allowed to ask for their money back, blank-cheque companies are seen as a relatively risk-free investment. So most hedge funds can usually get quite a bit of leverage from their prime brokers to juice their returns. But market experts say this doesn't seem to be the case any more.&#xa0;</p> <p>Archegos, whose collapse left major banks nursing more than $10bn in losses, has left many lenders with a sour taste.</p> <p>Leverage restrictions are the latest setback for Spacs, which as recently as a few months ago were considered the hottest investment product on Wall Street. They have also started to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19c021a5-a758-489e-875a-de5c99bbfbfe\">fall out of favour</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7c0f11c-b678-491d-9173-fe49ea29b4b8\">poor performance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\">regulatory scrutiny</a>.</p> <h2>French billionaires go to the museum</h2> <p>More than two decades ago, one of the most contentious rivalries in French fashion history clashed on the world stage.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0344c6f6-4df5-11e8-97e4-13afc22d86d4\">“handbag wars”</a>, a multiyear battle for control of the Italian brand <strong>Gucci</strong> between <strong>LVMH</strong> boss <strong>Bernard</strong><strong>Arnault</strong> and the billionaire chair of<strong> Kering</strong> group<strong> François Pinault</strong>, ended in Arnault's defeat.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pinault emerged victorious in 2001, paying about $800m for the Milan-based luxury label.</p> <p>DD regulars know Arnault is doing just fine these days. He's salvaged a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dca6fd2a-a42b-4705-8d48-486a2ab0916b\">broken engagement</a> with the US jeweller <strong>Tiffany</strong>, and is keeping busy with everything from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f523768d-41af-492c-95b0-ff5d23a30539\">Spacs</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/840826e8-a70e-4f1d-82a4-1b83895eced5\">celebrity-studded deals</a>.</p> <p>But we couldn't help thinking about the duelling dealmakers' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/912476ba-1293-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">long-held grudges</a> when our colleague Leila Abboud published <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42e3a9d9-b70d-4650-8c55-12cb3fb94288\">this story</a> out of Paris.</p> <p>Pinault has been agonising over the very French-billionaire problem of where to store his collection of 10,000 art works for more than two decades, as bureaucratic infighting and delays stifled his ambitions of opening a museum in France's capital. Finally, his dream has been realised.</p> <p>He follows other wealthy French tycoons transforming the city's historic arts scene with private capital. Including none other than Arnault the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8edf6a9b-1866-4323-be7a-43e60c455e79\">wolf in cashmere</a>” himself, whose <strong>Fondation Louis Vuitton</strong> sits just down the road.</p> <p>As Leila reports, though, Pinault paid Arnault a friendly visit when his sprawling museum opened in 2014, and Arnault has now returned the courtesy.&#xa0;</p> <p>We wonder what they talked about.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Dario Scannapieco</strong>, vice-president of the <strong>European Investment Bank</strong>, has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3481cfd7-46c4-491b-9e19-74f28819e523\">appointed</a> by Italian prime minister <strong>Mario Draghi</strong>'s government as the new head of the state-controlled investment bank <strong>Cassa Depositi e Prestiti</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Disney</strong> is electing two new directors to its board: <strong>Cisco</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> alum<strong> Amy Chang</strong>, and <strong>Calvin McDonald</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Lululemon Athletica</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Brian Hook</strong> has been appointed vice-chair of<strong> Cerberus Global Investments</strong>, which focuses on international business and investment strategies. Hook was most recently senior adviser to the former US secretary of state <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong> in <strong>Donald</strong> <strong>Trump</strong>'s administration.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jones Day</strong> has hired <strong>Jean-Guillaume de Tocqueville </strong>as a partner in its financial markets practice and <strong>Matthieu Ollivry</strong> as counsel. Both join in Paris from <strong>Gide Loyrette Nouel</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ashurst </strong>has elected its current UK corporate head and board member <strong>Karen Davies</strong> as its new chair. She will begin her four-year term on August 1, succeeding <strong>Ben Tidswell</strong>, who has accepted a judicial appointment as a panel chair of the UK's <strong>Competition Appeal Tribunal</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Arnold &amp; Porter</strong> has recruited <strong>Jane Norberg</strong> as a partner in its securities enforcement and litigation practice as a partner in Washington. She was previously chief of the US <strong>Security and Exchange Commission</strong>'s whistleblower office.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Buyout bottleneck </strong>Private equity-backed takeovers of UK companies have reached record highs, triggering fears of a Britain overrun by “City plunderers”.
