  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Johansson's Agent Rips Disney Over Film Flap",
  "text": "<p>Disney said the suit had \"no merit\" and called it \"especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" which has kept many movie theaters closed and attendance light at those that are open. Disney also said Ms. Johansson has been paid $20 million for \"Black Widow\" already and has the ability to earn more.</p><p>\"They have shamelessly and falsely accused Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global Covid pandemic,\" CAA Co-Chairman Bryan Lourd said in a statement. Mr. Lourd blasted Disney for releasing details of Ms. Johansson's salary and for attempting to tie her lawsuit to the pandemic. Disney \"included her salary in their press statement in an attempt to weaponize her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of,\" he added.</p><p>Mr. Lourd said Disney's response to Ms. Johansson is an attack on her character that is \"beneath the company that many of us in the creative community have worked with successfully for decades.\"</p><p>A Disney spokeswoman didn't respond to a request to comment on Mr. Lourd's statement.</p><p>Ms. Johansson said in the suit that her contract with Disney's Marvel Entertainment guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release. Because her salary for \"Black Widow\" was based primarily on box-office performance, Ms. Johansson alleged Marvel was obligated to renegotiate her deal to compensate for the revenue the movie would generate on Disney+.</p><p>The lawsuit sent shock waves through the entertainment industry, as it is rare for fights between media conglomerates and talent to go public. In her suit, Ms. Johansson alleged her advisers were told by Marvel that they understood that if \"Black Widow\" was to be put on Disney+ during the window of its theatrical run, her contract would need to be renegotiated.</p><p>Those discussions took place in early 2019, long before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>CAA's Mr. Lourd said Disney knowingly violated her contract as part of its long-term strategy to focus on streaming and enhance its own profits.</p><p>\"They have very deliberately moved the revenue stream and profits to the Disney+ side of the company, leaving artistic and financial partners out of their new equation. That's it, pure and simple,\" Mr. Lourd said.</p><p>Disney said Thursday it has fully complied with Ms. Johansson's contract.</p><p>When AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia decided to release Warner Bros. movies on its HBO Max streaming service simultaneously with their theatrical debut, it renegotiated deals with top talent including Denzel Washington and \"Wonder Woman\" star Gal Gadot. WarnerMedia ended up spending more than $200 million on cutting new deals with talent whose contracts were tied to box-office performance.</p><p>Disney declined to elaborate on its dealings with talent and whether it also would or had compensated talent for putting movies on Disney+ at the same time as their theatrical release. Talent agents say Disney hasn't shown the same willingness as WarnerMedia to renegotiate.</p>",
