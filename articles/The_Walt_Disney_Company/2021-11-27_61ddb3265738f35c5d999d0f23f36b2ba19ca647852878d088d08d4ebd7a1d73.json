  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Style & Fashion:  Flare Tactics  ---  Like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, Y2K-era bell-bottom jeans are back -- and  their biggest proponents might surprise you. How to wear them today.  ----  By Katharine K. Zarrella",
  "text": "<p>   Exciting\" and \"definitely new\" is how Eliza T. Pendergast described the latest trend sweeping the denim market. Like many of her Gen-Z peers, Ms. Pendergast, a student at Hamilton College in upstate New York, decries skinny jeans. She associates those constricting pants with the peppy stars of Disney shows she loathed as a kid. These new jeans, though, are different. They have a \"much better silhouette,\" said Ms. Pendergast, 19. They lend her outfits a symmetry that makes her feel \"balanced.\" They don't compress her calves. They're flares. </p><p>   Yes, flares, the trumpeted jeans (also called boot-cuts or bell-bottoms) that populated 1960s protests; hid '70s platform heels; and rode low on hips circa Y2K. \"Obviously they've been around,\" said Ms. Pendergast, who sat out their last incarnation on account of being a toddler. \"To me,\" she clarified, \"they're a new thing.\" </p><p>   After skinny jeans' nearly 15-year-reign, flares are swelling in popularity again. Stella McCartney sells a broad-belled pair. Victoria Beckham offers multiple versions, as does Levi's. Jill Guenza, Levi's vice president of women's design, reports that the brand's '70s High Rise Flare, which launched in August, is outperforming its '70s Straight counterpart. \"People are really responding,\" she said. According to Sidney Morgan-Petro, who analyzes retail at trend-forecasting agency WGSN, flares account for 19% of the U.S.'s new denim styles this year, a 35% increase from 2020. \"That's more interest than we've seen in a long time,\" she said. </p><p>   That interest has served New York designer Nili Lotan well. Since her boot-cut Celia Jean debuted in 2020, the style's appeal has surged. Its sales are currently up nearly 75% year over year. Flares are almost \"universally flattering\" no matter your shape, contends Ms. Lotan, an opinion echoed by many women interviewed for this story. By balancing the hips and concealing shoes, they \"compliment the body [and] make you look longer,\" she said. \"It makes you feel sexy.\" </p><p>   Facilitating sexiness wasn't flares' original purpose. World War II Navy crews donned boot-cut denim trousers that could be swiftly rolled up if the ship's deck got wet, said fashion curator Emma McClendon. Postwar, flares landed in Navy surplus stores and, ironically enough, were adopted by '60s antiwar hippies. Equally ironic, \"in creating a distinctive look as a form of protest,\" said Ms. McClendon, hippies \"crafted a style that got picked up by the very consumerist industry they were protesting.\" </p><p>   In the '90s and '00s, brands like Versace reinterpreted '60s codes -- flares included -- through a modern lens, just as today's designers are playing with Y2K looks. Indeed, all things aughts are freshly relevant -- Britney Spears is finally free, Paris Hilton got married, Hulu confoundingly released a docuseries about Von Dutch, a brand associated with noughties-era trucker hats -- so a flare revival seems apt. But what propels this hamster wheel of nostalgia? \"As an adult, you are constantly trying to re-create the fashion that [peaked] right before you could participate,\" said Ms. McClendon, crediting Museum at FIT deputy director Patricia Mears with that theory. </p><p>   But 20-somethings aren't solely responsible for flares' ascent. Jes Gordon, 52, reinstated them in lockdown. \"Fashion is not just a visual experience,\" said the event producer, who splits her time between Beacon, N.Y., and Manhattan. \"It's an emotional one.\" She's found comfort in flares, which she prefers over skinny jeans for working from home, and which conjure warm memories of the '70s and '90s, \"carefree . . . wonderful times.\" </p><p>   Likewise, flares hark back to childhood for Claire Kayser, an artist in St. Paul, Minn. Over Zoom, Ms. Kayser, 54, brandished a 1979 yearbook photo of her and her twin sister in matching bell-bottoms. She favored flares in the '00s, too, and saved prized pairs from brands like True Religion and 7 For All Mankind, which she wears often now, teamed with sneakers, block heels, blazers and silk tops. \"I knew I'd pull them out again, partly because I grew up with them.\" </p><p>   Today's flares aren't carbon copies of their predecessors. Fabrics are more advanced and millennials can rest easy: Gratuitous stitching and bedazzling haven't been reprised (yet). Nevertheless, if you're worried that you might inspire comparisons to the extras in 2001's \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" video, consider cropped takes by brands such as Frame and Mother, suggests Caroline Maguire, fashion director at e-commerce site Shopbop. It's \"a newer way to wear a flare,\" she said. Ideal accoutrement: snug boots that accentuate the ankle. </p><p>   Still, a classic flare's elongating powers are unrivaled -- provided you adhere to what New York stylist Kate Young calls \"shoe-hem agreement.\" If flares \"hover 2 inches off the floor and you can see your foot, they're not elongating your leg,\" she said, noting hems should skim the ground. She's also wary of retro, pubis-grazing cuts. \"The low-waist thing is cute on kids, but I think grown-ups should wear a high-waisted flare,\" she said, arguing it ups the illusion of length. </p><p>   Ms. Pendergast, the college student, lets the weather dictate her rise, choosing high waists in winter and low ones in warm months. She typically pairs her flares with sneakers and appreciates the oomph her jeans afford, calling their conical legs built-in accessories. \"Also, my mom and grandma love it,\" she said. \"It's nice when I get a thumbs-up from them.\" </p><p></p>",
