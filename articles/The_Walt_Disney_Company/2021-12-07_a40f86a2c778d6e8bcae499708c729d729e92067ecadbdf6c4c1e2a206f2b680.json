  "title": "Half of Americans Back Biden's Vaccine-or-Test Mandate for Private Sector, WSJ Poll Finds; Fifty percent of voters in The Wall Street Journal's poll said they support the requirements for companies with 100 or more employees, while 47% oppose them",
  "text": "<p>The Wall Street Journal Survey</p><p>* Read the Results</p><p>Voters were also divided on whether the Covid-19 vaccine should be mandatory for school-aged children, with more people in favor of requiring vaccines for older children. Fifty-one percent of respondents said they would support schools requiring that children 12 and older get vaccinated, while 45% said they were opposed to the idea. Voters were evenly split, 48%-48%, on whether schools should mandate vaccines for children ages 5 to 11.</p><p>The findings come after the Biden administration's vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers, which is slated to go into effect Jan. 4, was temporarily blocked by a court last month amid legal challenges. Mr. Biden's separate vaccine mandate for healthcare workers was also blocked by courts.</p><p>Mr. Biden has also mandated vaccines for federal employees and contractors, as well as U.S. service members. Many large businesses, including Walt Disney Co. and meatpacker Tyson Foods Inc., hospital groups, and colleges and universities, have already implemented Covid-19 vaccine requirements.</p><p>The Biden administration has underscored the urgency of getting vaccinated amid the emergence of the Omicron variant, which had been identified in 16 states as of Sunday, and it encouraged people to get booster shots.</p><p>Roughly 63.8% of the eligible U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 71.5% of adults, or 185 million people, are fully vaccinated, and nearly 47 million people have received a booster dose, which has so far been authorized for use in adults.</p><p>California is the only state that has thus far unveiled plans to add the Covid-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for K-12 schools, pending full authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>The Journal poll found that respondents with children in the household were more likely to oppose vaccine mandates in schools. People with children under the age of 18 oppose a school vaccine requirement for adolescents by a 7-point margin and a requirement for children ages 5 to 11 by a 14-point margin. By contrast, voters without a child in the home were more receptive to vaccine requirements at schools. These respondents favored rather than opposed a requirement for adolescents by a margin of 14 points, and they favored a requirement for children ages 5 to 11 by 9 points.</p><p>Among parents, 52% of respondents who identified as fathers said they favor a requirement in schools that children ages 12 and up be vaccinated, compared with 40% of mothers. Both a majority of mothers and fathers said they would oppose schools requiring children ages 5 to 11 to be vaccinated.</p><p>The Journal poll found that partisan divides remain when it comes to perceptions of vaccine mandates more broadly. Twenty percent of Republicans said they favor Mr. Biden's vaccine requirements for larger employers, compared with 41% of independents and 88% of Democrats. Senate Republicans are backing a legislative maneuver to roll back that vaccine requirement, though the measure is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled House, and with only one Democratic senator currently on board, Republicans don't have enough support to override a presidential veto.</p><p>Republicans were also more likely than independents or Democrats to oppose vaccine requirements for public safety workers and the prospect of schools mandating the vaccine for children, the poll found. A majority of independents oppose Mr. Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for private companies, while a majority of independents support state or local vaccine mandates for public safety workers, the Journal poll found.</p><p>\"Most everything regarding Covid has become very polarized by party,\" said Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, whose firm conducted the survey with the firm of John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster. \"The mandates particularly become very polarized.\"</p><p>A majority of Americans are confident in the Covid-19 vaccines' safety. Sixty-five percent of Republican voters said the vaccines are either very or somewhat safe, and 67% of independent voters and 93% of Democrats said the same. A total of 75% of respondents said the vaccines are very or somewhat safe, compared with 16% who said it is not safe at all.</p><p>Among the respondents, 40% of people who said they aren't vaccinated said the vaccines are very effective or somewhat effective. And 28% of unvaccinated respondents said the vaccines are either very safe or somewhat safe.</p><p>Mr. Anzalone, the Democratic pollster, said the findings show that some voters could still be persuaded to get vaccinated despite the partisan divide.</p><p>WSJ CEO Council Summit</p><p>Leaders in business and policy including John Anzalone and Tony Fabrizio discuss the topics that matter most to decision makers.</p><p>* View the live coverage here</p><p>\"There's a universe of the unvaccinated who believe it's safe and effective,\" Mr. Anzalone said. \"They want it done on their own timeline, if you willâ€¦and Omicron may be the catalyst that helps people get to the pharmacy to get it done.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal Poll was conducted by the firms ALG Research and Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, who surveyed 1,500 registered voters from Nov. 16-22. Half the respondents were interviewed on their cellphones. One quarter were reached by text on their cellphones and completed an internet survey. One quarter of respondents were interviewed by landline phone. The margin of error for the full sample was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.</p><p>Write to Sabrina Siddiqui at Sabrina.Siddiqui@wsj.com</p><p>Half of Americans Back Biden's Vaccine-or-Test Mandate for Private Sector, WSJ Poll Finds</p>",
