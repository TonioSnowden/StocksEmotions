  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co. said Geoff Morrell, its head of corporate affairs and a top lieutenant to Chief Executive Bob Chapek, is leaving after less than four months on the job. </p><p>   His departure comes amid a tumultuous two months for Disney's government-affairs staff caused by a clash with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over a bill limiting LGBT discussion in elementary schools. </p><p>   As the leader of corporate affairs, Mr. Morrell oversaw corporate communications, global public policy and government relations. </p><p>   In a message to his staff, Mr. Morrell wrote, \"After three months in this new role, it has become clear to me that for a number of reasons it is not the right fit.\" He wished Disney and Mr. Chapek \"the very best.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chapek in an email Friday to Disney executives wrote that Mr. Morrell was leaving to pursue other opportunities. </p><p>   Mr. Morrell joined Disney after an 11-year stint in communications and external affairs at U.K. energy giant BP PLC. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek said communications efforts will fall under Kristina Schake, who was named executive vice president of global communications earlier in April. </p><p></p>",
