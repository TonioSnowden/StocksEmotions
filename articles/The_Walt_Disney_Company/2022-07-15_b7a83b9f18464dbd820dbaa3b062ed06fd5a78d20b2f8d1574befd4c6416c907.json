  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> Aston Martin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ec233e4-02a7-4824-9923-266cbd55fead\">is closing in on a deal</a> to raise significantly more than £500mn by bringing in Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund as a significant shareholder and holding a rights issue for current investors, according to two people.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Bankers face the music</p></li>  <li><p>Crypto finally has its day in court&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Investors sour on China's VC scene</p></li> </ul> <h1>Bad vibes grip Wall Street&#xa0;</h1> <p>In 2021, the big fear for bank chieftains such as <strong>Goldman</strong>'s <strong>David</strong> <strong>Solomon</strong> was the unrest among junior bankers as they churned out an epic pipeline of initial public offerings, mega mergers and blank cheque deals.</p> <p>As he prepares for DJ season in the Hamptons, Solomon doesn't have to worry about another <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">leaked PowerPoint presentation</a> from employees complaining about burnout. </p> <p>A bigger issue has emerged that will strike enough fear into bankers to put them back in line.</p> <p>Business on Wall Street has dried up amid a sharp sell-off in stocks, surging inflation and fast rising interest rates.</p> <p>On Thursday, <strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>issued a warning sign that a golden age for deals has ended. The New York group's investment banking revenues of $1.4bn were 55 per cent below analyst forecasts.</p> <p>The miss, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/363f5364-1848-4f93-a4f5-000891c5cbb0\">combined with a suspension of share buybacks</a>, sent JPMorgan's stock lower and into a 30 per cent drawdown for the year, the FT's Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise report.</p> <p>The biggest issue was a slowdown in IPOs. Equity underwriting fees were off 77 per cent, while debt underwriting fees were down by more than half as capital markets seized up.</p> <p>Even worse may be the hangover from the era of cheap money as the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> quickly raises interest rates. </p> <p>JPMorgan took a $257mn writedown from bridge loans and unfunded leveraged buyout financing commitments it is trying to distribute. </p> <p><strong>Morgan</strong> <strong>Stanley</strong>'s investment banking revenues fell 55 per cent, slightly less than JPMorgan. A surprise was its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b2d6cf8-c6e0-423b-b0e9-5681340da4d1\">$200mn settlement</a> over bankers' use of personal devices and poor record keeping. (JPMorgan also paid that amount in fines to resolve a similar case.)</p> <p>JPMorgan chief<strong> Jamie Dimon </strong>believes he sidestepped the worst of it. </p> <p>“Our bridge book is smaller than it was because we priced ourselves out of the market and that was a good thing because a lot of people lost a lot of money there and we lost a little,” he said, referring to now troubled financings for large leveraged buyouts. </p> <p><strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Suisse</strong>, <strong>Bank of America</strong> and Goldman are figuring out how to syndicate debt for <strong>Elliott</strong> <strong>Management</strong> and <strong>Vista</strong> <strong>Equity</strong>'s $16.5bn buyout of <strong>Citrix</strong>, a financing JPMorgan skipped. It also passed on 2022's biggest potential debacle, <strong>Elon</strong> <strong>Musk</strong>'s $44bn buyout of <strong>Twitter</strong>, a deal the mercurial billionaire is now trying to terminate. </p> <p>Goldman will report earnings on Monday. The early warnings are enough to kill whatever vibe Solomon and his bankers had going into the weekend.</p> <h1>Celsius heats up the restructuring world</h1> <p>Customers hoping to reach <strong>Celsius</strong> <strong>Network</strong> had to dial 1-866-HODL-NOW to get through to the now-failed crypto lender.</p> <p>For DD readers wilfully ignorant of the speculative asset class, the term “HODL” was a typo for “hold” made by a trader during one of crypto's many plunges. It has since morphed into the industry's mantra, “hold on for dear life”.</p> <p>Over the past month, lenders such as Celsius and <strong>Voyager</strong> <strong>Digital</strong> have lived up to the rallying cry by freezing customer assets to stem runs by depositors amid a crypto sell-off. Unfortunately, that couldn't save either from bankruptcy. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Celsius followed in Voyager's footsteps and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d6dee7d-2cc9-4663-a0a2-e469686baca5\">filed for Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy protection, DD's Antoine Gara and the FT's Kadhim Shubber and Joshua Oliver reported. The lender's first-day declaration showed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0babff4f-2212-41a4-844e-bbd09b1ef245\">$1.2bn financial hole</a>. </p> <p>The bankruptcies indicate that there is a nascent business taking shape on Wall Street. Restructuring advisers are finding good work unwinding failed crypto trading groups.</p> <p>Investment bank <strong>Moelis &amp; Co </strong>is advising Voyager, while <strong>Berkeley</strong> <strong>Research</strong> <strong>Group</strong> is its restructuring adviser. </p> <p><strong>Centerview</strong> <strong>Partners</strong> is advising Celsius, while <strong>Alvarez &amp; Marsal</strong>, the consultancy famed for unwinding <strong>Lehman</strong> <strong>Brothers</strong>, is its restructuring adviser.</p> <p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis </strong>has been hired by both companies as a legal adviser.</p> <p>It's a good bet more restructurings are in store. Crypto exchange <strong>FTX</strong> lent emergency cash to <strong>BlockFi</strong>, but its coffers are limited.</p> <p>The restructurings also offer surprising career opportunities. <strong>David</strong> <strong>Barse</strong>, the former chief executive of <strong>Third</strong> <strong>Avenue</strong> <strong>Management</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad63d6d4-62c3-39b4-aa54-2409aedab8f0\">left the investment firm</a> as his debt fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87ed9a00-c16f-11e5-846f-79b0e3d20eaf\">suspended investor withdrawals</a>, has been named a director of Celsius.</p> <p>Regardless, there's a grim reality for true believers of “DeFi”, or crypto's promise to supplant the traditional financial services industry. </p> <p>It is establishment hands like the judges and advisers who waded through the mess of the 2008 financial crisis who are now the HODLers' best hope. Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b271b7e2-a97c-40cc-889b-67d9a3157b3e\">notes</a> they face many novel challenges.</p> <h1>A flashing red warning sign for venture firms in China</h1> <p>China funds are struggling to raise new capital as institutional investors begin to rethink locking up their cash in the country, wary of Beijing's regulatory crackdowns and growing geopolitical risk. </p> <p>Venture capital investors <strong>Genesis Capital</strong>, <strong>Xiang He Capital</strong> and <strong>Centurium</strong>, which had cumulatively raised billions of dollars for prior funds, are facing drawn out fundraisings and other <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91441aca-1665-4660-843f-9cf7222becff\">challenges in closing new rounds</a>, the FT reports.</p> <p>Centurium's first fund signed up 40 American investors for $1.9bn in 2019. Its second fund this year took 12 months to raise just $250mn from six US investors.</p> <p>Even <strong>Philippe</strong> <strong>Laffont</strong>'s <strong>Coatue</strong> <strong>Management</strong>, one of the biggest “Tiger cubs”, has struggled to pull in all the capital it aimed to raise for China investments. Its inaugural China-heavy Asia fund has raised less than $1bn after targeting $1.5bn-$2bn when starting to pitch investors last August. </p> <p>Western investors such as pensions and endowments are worried. </p> <p><strong>John Bradley</strong>, the head of private equity investments at Florida's pension fund, summed up some of the fears in a meeting last month. “The risk part of the equation [for China] has probably increased exponentially and so it's led us to back off.”</p> <p>The rethink marks a sharp turn of fortunes for China's VC community and the start-ups they seed, after a decade of foreign money spawned thousands of fund managers and incubated today's tech titans like <strong>Alibaba</strong>, <strong>TikTok</strong> owner <strong>ByteDance</strong> and food delivery group <strong>Meituan</strong>. </p> <p>China-focused PE and VC fundraising was down 94 per cent in the first half of 2022. &#xa0;</p> <p>However, recent announcements from <strong>Sequoia Capital China </strong>and <strong>Qiming Venture Partners</strong> signal investors with the best records can still raise money — and may benefit from a flight to quality. The two VC groups have closed more than $10bn since July 1.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Alphabet</strong> has added <strong>Marty Chavez</strong>, the former chief financial officer of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and the current vice-chair of <strong>Sixth Street </strong>to its board of directors. Chavez will replace board director<strong> Robin Washington </strong>on the tech company's audit and compliance committees. Washington will continue as a director, chairing Alphabet's leadership development, inclusion and compensation committees.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>James Gill</strong> has been named head of financial institutions investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at <strong>Bank of America</strong>.
