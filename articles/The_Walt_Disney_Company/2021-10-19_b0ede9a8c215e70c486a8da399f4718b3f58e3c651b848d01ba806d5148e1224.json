  "text": "<p>The company has received interest from multiple suitors and is seeking a valuation of more than $3 billion, some of the people said. One suitor is a company backed by private-equity giant Blackstone Inc. run by former Walt Disney Co. executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, the people said.</p><p>There is no guarantee that the conversations with potential acquirers will result in a deal, the people said. Moonbug is also weighing an initial public offering, which executives believe would result in a valuation significantly higher than $3 billion, some of the people said.</p><p>The growing appetite for TV shows and movies sparked by the rise of new streaming services has kicked off a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in Hollywood as independent studios look to cash in on the gold rush. Messrs. Mayer and Staggs are on the hunt for shows and movies they can build entertainment franchises around and recently spent $900 million to acquire Hello Sunshine, the media company founded by Reese Witherspoon. Last month, Netflix said it was buying the rights to stories by children's author Roald Dahl for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>Moonbug is on pace to generate roughly $100 million in profit this year, according to people familiar with the matter, through a combination of licensing, advertising and selling merchandise related to its popular shows. Moonbug is expecting profit to double next year to roughly $200 million, as it acquires new shows and licenses them to distributors around the globe. By the end of 2021, Moonbug expects to have at least 100 licensing partners, up from 15 at the beginning of the year.</p><p>Moonbug has raised $265 million from investors including Felix Capital, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and merchant bank Raine Group, which owns a majority stake, one of the people said. The last funding round, a $120 million infusion in 2020, valued the company at nearly $1 billion, the person said.</p><p>Moonbug is looking to meet the growing appetite for children's content as the pipeline for popular shows from traditional TV networks runs dry. Demand for children's content grew by nearly 58% since the beginning of 2020, according to Parrot Analytics, far outpacing the increase in overall demand for content.</p><p>There weren't any shows from traditional networks of the caliber of Nickelodeon's \"Paw Patrol\" or \"Dora the Explorer\" to meet that demand, said Cyma Zarghami, former president of ViacomCBS Inc.'s brand Nickelodeon who has founded her own children's content company, Mimo Studios.</p><p>London-based Moonbug was co-founded in 2018 by Rene Rechtman and John Robson, former employees of Disney and ViacomCBS's Paramount Pictures.</p><p>Moonbug scouts for popular children's shows and characters on video platforms like YouTube -- including the suspender-clad educational narrator \"Blippi\" and early-childhood series \"Little Baby Bum\" -- and builds franchises that could include streaming-TV deals, movies and merchandise.</p>",
