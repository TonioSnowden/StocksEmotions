  "title": "Jungle Cruise — Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson on a buoyant ride",
  "text": "<p>Nominally, according to its end credits,&#xa0;<em>Jungle Cruise</em>&#xa0;is based on the 66-year-old Disneyland boat ride, a low-intensity, narrative-free, grandparent-friendly experience wherein the passengers pootle past an assortment of animatronic animals while the skipper lays down a steady stream of puns and Christmas cracker jokes. But, taking a meta-conceptual film-making approach, this lavishly budgeted feature is also, in a sense, based on another Disney-ride-to-film adaptation,&#xa0;<em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>. </p> <p>Like its buccaneering exemplar, <em>Jungle Cruise</em> blends period trappings (it is set during the second world war), exoticism, a sprinkling of supernatural CGI fairy dust, and a very on-Disney-brand taste for mechanics-based slapstick. The characters are forever fiddling with widgets to unlock whatchamacallits or activating pulleys and machines to escape villains or steal things.</p> <p>Emily Blunt stars as plucky scientist Lily Houghton (there's a wry running gag about people being perpetually shocked to see a woman in trousers that somehow gets funnier through excessive repetition). Lily is determined to find a blossom tree in the Amazon rainforest that can cure all manner of ills, and drags along her sweetly effete brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall), another one of Disney's only-just-gay characters (the coding obvious only to adults). They are guided by Dwayne Johnson's salty sea-dog skipper Frank.</p> <p>Partly written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the secret weapons of many a fine Hollywood comedy (<em>Bad Santa</em>;&#xa0;<em>Crazy, Stupid, Love</em>), this is a much funnier, more buoyant movie than you might expect. The extra lime in its&#xa0;caipirinha&#xa0;is the casting of an assortment of outstanding character actors in supporting roles, including Jesse Plemons, Paul Giamatti and Édgar Ramírez&#xa0;as a heavy called Aguirre, the name tipping a plumed conquistador hat towards Werner Herzog's Amazon-set classic&#xa0;<em>Aguirre, the Wrath of God</em>. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas worldwide from July 30</em></p><p>Source: Leslie Felperin 2021 'Jungle Cruise — Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson on a buoyant ride' FT.com 28 July.
