  "title": "How Did a Family From Orlando Adjust to Life on a Vermont Farm? 'It Was Learn-By-Fire.'; In 2019, Lisa and Gary Turchin bought a roughly 91-acre property in Londonderry and took refuge there during the pandemic. Now they're putting the farm back on the market for $4.25 million.",
  "text": "<p>Since 2019, when the Turchins bought a roughly 91-acre farm in Vermont, Mr. Turchin has embraced the couple's farm lifestyle with gusto, springing for a John Deere tractor with air conditioning and Bluetooth speakers, building a state-of-the-art chicken coop with automatic doors and renovating a picturesque stable that would be at home on any Walt Disney movie set. \"He's always doing the over-the-top extra,\" said Ms. Turchin.</p><p>The couple, who also have a home in Orlando, Fla., started looking for a farm property in New England several years ago with the intention of splitting their time between the two locations. Married since 1992, the Turchins met at Walt Disney World, where they both worked during the 1980s. They have nine children together—four biological children in their 20s and five daughters with special needs who were adopted from China. \"We've been very fortunate in life,\" said Mr. Turchin. He sold his Orlando-based company to a private equity shop in 2012. He has since started a second ad agency, also in Orlando. Ms. Turchin cares for the children full time.</p><p>Mr. Turchin said they wanted to create a different lifestyle for the girls, ages 9 to 17, whose disabilities range from deafness to spina bifida. \"In Orlando, it's big, it's busy, it's loud, it's theme parks,\" he said. They picked Vermont \"on a whim,\" he said, and flew up from Florida to see about 10 farms over a long weekend. \"We made a pact that we'd have a contract before we got on the plane—and we did,\" he said.</p><p>In 2019, they paid $2.65 million for a farm in Londonderry, a mountain town in southern Vermont near several major ski resorts. The Turchins' property has a roughly 7,700-square-foot main residence with six bedrooms. There is also a stable with 10 stalls, an indoor riding arena, a three-bedroom apartment above the stable, a guest cabin and a pool. Now, with several daughters needing surgery, the Turchins decided they need to be in Orlando full time. They are listing the home for $4.25 million.</p><p>Mr. Turchin said the house was in great shape when they bought it, but the property needed updating. They invested approximately $1.7 million overall, and upgrades included remodeling the stable and refurbishing the riding arena. They also redid the apartment above the stable and added a separate guest cabin to the property. In the main residence, the Turchins installed air-conditioning and energy-efficient windows. They also upgraded the electrical system and plumbing, and added a generator and fiber optic cable.</p><p>The Turchins didn't cut corners. They built a chicken coop with automatic feeders and watering systems as well as doors that open during the day and close at night. \"It's the James Bond of chicken coops,\" said Mr. Turchin, who said his wife hung a sign out front that reads, \"The Chick Inn.\"</p><p>Initially, the Turchins intended to split their time between Orlando and Vermont but during Covid they took refuge on the farm. They filled it with animals, including chickens and ducks, 15 beef cows, two miniature donkeys, two miniature goats and two sheep. \"This is the world's nicest petting zoo,\" Mr. Turchin said. Because their daughter, Marigold, who is 9, uses a wheelchair, they bought her a four-wheel all-terrain vehicle to get around the property. Mr. Turchin said he ended up buying the other girls ATVs, too, which they rev up twice a day to do chores, like letting the animals in and out of their pens. \"It sounds like you're in Daytona Beach during Harley-Davidson weekend,\" Mr. Turchin said.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the Turchins' learning curve has been steep. \"When you go from a quarter-acre to an almost 100-acre farm it's like a shock to the system,\" Mr. Turchin said. \"You gotta go pick out a tractor. What do you mean eggs? It really was an amazing adventure.\"</p><p>Ms. Turchin said although they had pets before, they were unprepared to witness the vet neutering one of the baby goats. Her daughters watched as the vet cut off the goat's testicles and tossed them over her shoulder onto the barn floor. As the girls tried to comfort the goats, Mr. Turchin said, \"My one daughter says, 'I think we've seen enough.' \"</p><p>Likewise, the couple, who had no experience with cows, figured it wouldn't be too hard to raise cattle—until October 2020 when one of their cows had a breech calf.</p><p>\"It was learn-by-fire,\" said Mr. Turchin, who said he called his excavator, who is also his equal partner in ownership of the cows. Mr. Turchin said he then called a local farmer, who summoned help from 20 locals—including an employee at the local grocery store. Eventually, one of the farmers took the cow to the vet. \"This was like [stuff] you see in a movie,\" Mr. Turchin said. \"Afterward, I'm literally trying to hand them $100 bills to say thank you.\"</p><p>Other than the breech calf, Mr. Turchin said he and his wife went online and read articles about everything—what to do, what not to do, where to install a cow run (a fenced-in area for the animals to graze) and how to angle it based on the sun and wind. The Turchins and their daughters do the majority of the farm work, including tending to the 15 beef cows, although they have some help mowing the lawn, plowing the driveway, and doing small jobs.</p><p>In updating the farm, the couple has drawn on their appreciation for Disney. They painted several outbuildings red and designed the pool to look like an old swimming hole with boulders and waterfalls. \"I wanted it to feel like a Disney location,\" Mr. Turchin said. \"I'm the only guy with Restoration Hardware lighting in his stable.\"</p><p>At times, he admitted, he's gone over-the-top. During Covid, the girls attended school remotely, and when one of his daughters had to dress up like the writer Laura Ingalls Wilder for a school project, Mr. Turchin bought a full-size covered wagon to be the backdrop of her video. He subsequently added a vintage hay wagon, mostly for aesthetics. Separately, he added an authentic Aermotor windmill with 8-foot blades to help aerate a pond he stocked with 400 rainbow trout.</p><p>Londonderry has a mix of full-time residents and second-home owners, and the median listing price is $389,000, according to Realtor.com. News Corp., owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors. Land-based properties fetch around $2 million to $3 million, said listing agent Story Jenks of LandVest, who is marketing the property with his wife and business partner, Dia Jenks.</p><p>Mr. Turchin said the farm brought together their older and younger children, but their daughters are scheduled to have surgery in Florida, where they are cared for by longtime doctors. \"We're going to get extremely busy and it's going to be hard for us to spend time at the farm,\" he said. Although he called the decision to leave their Vermont farm \"heart-wrenching,\" he said family is more than the four walls around you. Over the past couple of years, he added, the girls have gotten a \"sense of the American dream.\"</p><p>Write to E.B.
