  "text": "<p>While tech stocks are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6691700c-9dfd-4911-8589-70b4ebd2caef\">having another dire day,</a> with the Nasdaq Composite index currently down 3 per cent, it's a double whammy if you've also been investing in cryptocurrencies (and bad news for all those<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/304d1447-5fce-421c-9ce7-0d48119da567\"> crypto beach bums in Bali</a> when they wake up).</p> <p>Bitcoin <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-09/bitcoin-tumbles-below-33-000-to-lowest-level-since-july-2021\">fell as much as 5 per cent </a>to around $32,630 on Monday and is now 50 per cent below its peak reached in November last year. The top 500 digital assets have also tumbled 50 per cent in that time. Cryptocurrencies have shed $1.6tn in market value since then, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a9df43-1ea0-4fb2-9b02-4944589fd909\">reports Scott Chipolina</a>, with interest rate rises sending investors fleeing from the riskiest corners of global financial markets.</p> <p>“This is a risk off across all asset classes, including crypto,” said Daniel Ives, strategist at Wedbush Securities, who added that there is “nowhere to hide”.</p> <p>Bitcoin is trading at its lowest level since July 2021, but losses are even deeper across the broader crypto market. An FT Wiltshire gauge tracking the top five coins, excluding bitcoin, has fallen almost 70 per cent from its recent high. Once fast-growing coins such as Solana, billed as an alternative to the Ethereum network, have rapidly deflated in value.</p> <p>Listed shares in crypto-exposed companies have slumped as well. MicroStrategy, which is led by crypto advocate Michael Saylor, has dropped 55 per cent so far this year. Coinbase has dropped 65 per cent in 2022, falling below $100 on Monday for the first time since the exchange went public in New York last April. </p> <p>The pullback also highlights how the performance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is tightly linked with the US stock market. The correlation between bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite, a gauge that is weighted towards America's big tech companies, has reached <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a97e142b-e718-4cd0-8cfb-aedaaeb3f723\">record highs</a>, according to data provider Kaiko.</p> <p>“Some investors are playing crypto like a hedge against inflation, but it's trading like the Nasdaq's Siamese twin,” said Ives. </p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Crypto-mixing sanctioned by US</strong><br>Crypto is also under pressure from the authorities over its use in money-laundering. The US Treasury department on Friday unveiled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/795892b3-806b-4079-8bc9-6cf75dc074f4\">measures against Blender.io</a> for its role in helping a hacking group sponsored by North Korea launder $20.5mn in “illicit proceeds” from one of the biggest-ever crypto heists.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2fa20459-d432-4b5f-8cc4-e6ba02413cb0.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>2. Semiconductor makers still look chipper</strong><br>Tech stocks may be falling but chipmakers continue to roll out strong results, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf49236e-0baf-4d53-84d1-563a869aa58d\">says Lex</a>. Germany's Infineon on Monday was bang on trend, reporting a (modest) profit beat in the second quarter and raising full-year sales guidance from €13bn to €13bn-€14bn. Infineon's auto industry specialisation — more than two-fifths of sales — means it benefits from healthy trading in electric and assisted-driving vehicles.</p> <p><strong>3. NSO stonewalls over legality</strong><br>Israeli spyware company NSO Group has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3323ae3a-6ace-43f2-a6e5-c0ee9b65b6b9\">stonewalled questions</a> over whether it is operating legally, according to consultants acting on behalf of the controversial company's owners. Berkeley Research Group has told EU lawmakers that its inquiries about NSO's “lawfulness” have been “ignored and/or frustrated by NSO Group's management team”.</p> <p><strong>4. Mukesh Ambani amps ecommerce deals</strong><br>Investments by Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7859d08d-c3e0-4531-a01e-510abd6b8284\"> hit a three-year high</a> in the first quarter at 10 deals. Two, worth around $330mn combined, were to strengthen Reliance Retail's ecommerce platform, with investments in delivery start-up Dunzo and robotics company Addverb, which is expected to help Reliance automate its warehouses.</p> <p><strong>5. Tech comment: Snapchat's lessons, Amazon streaming on</strong><br><em>Elaine Moore</em> urges Elon Musk to learn from the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88e84946-5d75-47eb-8f58-e678f8c326d9\"> changing fortunes of Snapchat</a>. The app now has 100mn more users than Twitter and its customer base is growing faster than Facebook's. <em>Chloe Cornish</em> writes about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a559cb29-d266-4323-ae2f-96f0d15ff77a\">streaming battles</a> for India's movie-loving, price-conscious consumers. At a glamorous corporate event, global media businesses seem unfazed by the recent humbling of Netflix.</p> <h2>Tech week ahead</h2> <p><em><strong>Tuesday:</strong></em> In the US, the struggling networked fitness company <strong>Peloton</strong> reports on its first quarter, amid reports it is looking to sell a 20 per cent stake in the company. In Japan, <strong>Sony</strong> and <strong>Nintendo</strong> announce quarterly results. <strong>Elon Musk</strong> addresses the FT Future of the Car Summit in London.

Its results will give some indication of the extent of problems in the tech supply chain and whether Covid lockdowns in China will further undermine the situation, hitting consumer electronics manufacturers worldwide. In the US, memory chipmaker <strong>Micron</strong> holds its investor day.</p> <p><em><strong>Friday:</strong></em> An update on its take-private plans is expected from <strong>Toshiba</strong> when it reports quarterly results.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Briiv air filter</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.briiv.co.uk/products/briiv\">Briiv's £299 air filter</a> is a terrarium with added oomph, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f2e4151-743d-48ac-b114-1dbcb7b3f696\"><em>writes Jamie Waters</em></a>. A clear jar filled with a miniature forest of lush lichen, its fan exhales Arctic-clean air from its reindeer moss, coconut-husk fibres and activated carbon interior. Tests show it effectively improves the air quality in a 36 sq m room in just an hour and has the same air-scrubbing impact as 3,043 houseplants.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2022 'Crypto crumbles as rates rise' FT.com 9 May.
