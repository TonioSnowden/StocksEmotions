  "text": "<p>The era of ease has officially ended at Netflix. The streaming pioneer added just 500,000 subscribers in the first quarter, even excluding losses from Russian operations. For the current second quarter, it predicted a worrying loss of 2mn users.</p> <p>By way of comparison, Netflix added 37mn subscribers in 2020. Profits and cash flow have always been scant but were tolerated because the company could point to an expanding user base around the globe. </p> <p>Now despairing boss Reed Hastings is making moves that could alienate skittish subscribers.</p> <p>In January, Netflix raised its base price in the US to $15.49 per month from $13.99. Today it estimates at least 100mn users are watching Netflix using shared passwords. The company plans to squeeze revenue from those free riders. It also wants to create a lower-priced ad-supported subscriptions tier to suss out price-sensitive users — which might cannibalise its existing customer base.</p> <p>Competition is savage in streaming. A series of Netflix copycats have sprung up, including HBO, Hulu, Disney and Peacock. All have deep pockets. Meanwhile, the likes of YouTube and TikTok lure eyeballs with user-generated video that is effectively free. </p> <p>The number of hours in the day to watch all this content remains resolutely inelastic.</p> <p>Netflix shares fell a whopping 36 per cent. The great rotation out of tech growth stocks leaves them vulnerable to sudden, heavy drops. Since its share price peak late last year, Netflix shares have crashed more than 60 per cent, reflecting a loss of around $200bn in equity value. </p> <p>In one bright spot, the company generated $800mn in free cash flow in the first quarter. But even annualising that figure gets to only $3.2bn against an implied current market capitalisation of around $120bn. Resources were tight enough in the first quarter that Netflix refrained from stock buybacks.</p> <p>The arms race in streaming has two main winners. First, customers who sign up for multiple services and cancel some of them quickly after bingeing a show they like. Second, content creators. They are benefiting from rival distributors desperate for the next big hit. It is no wonder private equity has been snapping up Hollywood sound stages as well as production businesses.</p> <p>Debt and equity investors have given Netflix the benefit of the doubt. Now the easy-money years of streaming are ending, just as Hollywood's golden years did.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Netflix: dwindling opportunities to boost user numbers spawn desperation' FT.com 20 April.
