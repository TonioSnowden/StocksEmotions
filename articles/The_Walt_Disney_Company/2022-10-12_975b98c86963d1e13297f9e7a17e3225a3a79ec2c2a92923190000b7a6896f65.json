  "text": "<p>The Italian Renaissance-style estate, built in 1999, is set on approximately 1.7 acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean, said listing agent Robert Kass of Hilton &amp; Hyland, who is marketing the property with colleague Drew Fenton. The main residence spans roughly 13,200 square feet with arched windows and doors facing the ocean. There is also a separate gatehouse, infinity pool and tennis court, Mr. Kass said.</p><p>The \"Believe\" singer paid $2.95 million for the property in 1989, records show. She previously listed the property for $45 million in 2009, according to Realtor.com. (News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.)</p><p>The house, which took nearly five years to build, was inspired by Venice, Italy, Cher said in an email. \"From every room, there is an ocean view,\" she added.</p><p>Cher said she entertained often in the home, hosting \"intimate dinners in the family dining room\" and larger \"tented parties in the courtyard and pool area.\"</p><p>\"My Rinpoche came to give a prayer session with a large group of friends,\" she said.</p><p>Located on Pacific Coast Highway, the gated property has a driveway lined with 40 Palm trees and a courtyard with a Moorish-style fountain. There are seven bedrooms, plus the gatehouse, which serves as a guesthouse. In the main residence, the primary suite has a meditation room and two closets, including one that doubles as a panic room, Mr. Kass said. The primary bathroom is designed like a hammam with Turkish wood screens.</p><p>The lower level of the house has an indoor-outdoor gym and theater. Cher also has a climate-controlled wig room with close to 100 hairpieces, according to the 2002 book \"The Cher Scrapbook.\"</p><p>Mr. Kass said the style of the home is dramatic, with high-end finishes, stone and hardware. The estate is \"iconic,\" he said. \"Everyone knows that house; it's at the end of the bluff so no one is on the right side.\"</p><p>Malibu, a mecca for celebrities and the uber-wealthy, has experienced a recentstring of high-priced sales and listings. Billionaire media mogul Byron Allen just paid $100 million for an estate in Paradise Cove formerly owned by self-storage billionaire Tammy Hughes Gustavson. Former Disney chief executiveMichael Eisner is asking $225 million for his Malibu compound. Last year, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and his wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, paid$177 million for an oceanfront home in Malibu.</p><p>Cher, known as a pop icon and Academy Award-winning singer and actor, gained popularity in the 1960s as half of the husband-wife duo Sonny &amp; Cher. She later released many of her own albums and there was a Broadway musical about her life.</p><p>Write to E.B Solomont at Eb.Solomont@wsj.com</p><p> Cher Wants $85 Million for Her Venice-Inspired Malibu Home</p>",
