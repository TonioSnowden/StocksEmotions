  "text": "<p>Sean Baker had a very good Cannes in 2017 with his Directors' Fortnight entry <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40013d92-c491-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675\"><em>The Florida Project</em></a>, about a young single mother and her pre-teen daughter living on benefits in a motel on the outskirts of Disney World. It followed his 2015 Sundance hit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/947eb154-893a-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c\"><em>Tangerine</em></a>, about two trans women hustling in West Hollywood, and paved the way for his seventh film, which this year elevated the New Jersey-born director to Cannes's main competition. </p> <p><em>Red Rocket</em>, the story of a fortysomething Los Angeles porn star who returns to his poor Texas homestead and his estranged wife, is an effortless crowd-pleaser despite featuring no stars (<em>The Florida Project</em> brought an Oscar nomination for Willem Dafoe, who played a janitor) or any discernible gimmicks (<em>Tangerine</em> was notable for being shot entirely using iPhones).</p> <p>Instead it stars Simon Rex, a sometime porn performer, online comedian and actor, who, until now, was mostly famous for appearing in the <em>Scary Movie</em> sequels as they careened ever further downhill. Rex plays Mikey, whose alter ego is Mikey Saber, a PornHub legend and winner of five Adult Video News awards. Mikey shows up in his old stomping ground to mooch off his unimpressed ex-wife Lexi (Bree Elrod) and her mother Lil, but wins them over with hard cash after taking up small-time drug-dealing, selling weed to hard hats at the local chemical plant.</p> <p>Baker's film takes a little while to hit its stride, with Mikey proving a love-hate figure for audiences as well as acquaintances, a chirpy and ever-optimistic but also rather shallow and self-serving individual. But when he takes Lexi and Lil into the local Donut Hole, everything clicks: there Mikey meets Strawberry (Suzanna Son), a pretty redhead just weeks away from her 18th birthday. Smitten with Strawberry, he worms his way into her favour, effectively grooming her for porn stardom, yet somehow Baker manages to portray their relationship without ever leering or becoming exploitative. Instead, his film becomes a twisted, doomed romance as Mikey projects on to Strawberry all his pathetic dreams of escape.</p> <p>Like <em>The Florida Project</em>, it's a story of life on the sidelines filled mostly with non-professionals literally discovered on the street (Lil was found emerging from a Portaloo; Strawberry in line for a movie theatre). But though it could easily descend into poverty porn, <em>Red Rocket</em> never does — Baker finds a kind of poetry in this pocket of Texas, packing it with a rich and diverse array of personalities, such as the phoney war veteran Lonnifer. </p> <p>The setting too is important, taking place in the run-up to Trump's 2016 election victory; though the film is by no means political, it does reflect on the circumstances surrounding his rise to the presidency, and in Mikey we get a glimpse of the America that voted Trump in: a little guy with nothing who looked at a billionaire and somehow saw a fellow traveller.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>Festival ends July 17, </em><a href=\"https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/\"><em>festival-cannes.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Damon Wise 2021 'Red Rocket — porn, poverty and twisted romance in Trump's America' FT.com 15 July.
