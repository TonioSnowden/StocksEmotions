  "title": "Disney+ Bucks Trend With  Hefty Gains in Subscribers  ----  By Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>    Walt Disney Co. reported better-than-expected subscription numbers for its Disney+ streaming service in the most recent quarter, avoiding a slowdown that dogged streaming rival Netflix Inc. </p><p>   In the company's fiscal second quarter earnings report, Disney reported 7.9 million new Disney+ subscribers to reach 137.7 million subscribers, up from 129.8 million in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the company to add 5.2 million net new subscribers to the platform, to bring the total to about 135 million. </p><p>   Chief Executive Bob Chapek reaffirmed Disney's targets of signing up between 230 million and 260 million subscribers to Disney+ and having the streaming video-on-demand business achieve profitability by September 2024, saying both goals were \"very achievable.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chapek said the company has not yet tapped into wide swaths of potential new subscribers and pointed to the company's slate of new TV and film offerings this year as the main driver of new paying customers. </p><p>   Shares of Disney fell 3% in extended-hours trading after initially rising on the earnings news. Before the results, the stock closed at $105.21, down 2.3% during the regular session. </p><p>   The world's largest entertainment company posted earnings of $470 million, or 26 cents a share, for the second quarter, down from $901 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were $1.08 a share, below analysts' expectations of $1.19. Revenue for the quarter was $19.25 billion, compared with $15.61 billion a year earlier. </p><p>   Disney launched the new Marvel Studios series \"Moon Knight\" earlier this year, and Mr. Chapek highlighted what he described as popular offerings among the more mature entertainment content on Disney's Hulu platform, such as reality show \"The Kardashians.\" </p><p>   Despite the better-than-anticipated subscriber growth, Disney saw losses widen dramatically at its direct-to-consumer segments, which also include the general entertainment streaming platform Hulu and streaming sports network ESPN+. Operating losses grew to $887 million in the quarter, compared with $290 million in the same period one year ago. </p><p>   In a conference call, analysts pressed Mr. Chapek about the high cost of acquiring new customers to Disney's streaming platforms. Spending on programming, production and marketing on content rose in the quarter, Mr. Chapek said, with about one-third of Disney's $32 billion content budget this year devoted to acquiring sports rights. </p><p>   One big driver of subscriptions this quarter was viewers of Indian Premier League cricket matches, which resumed in March. Christine McCarthy, the company's chief financial officer, said that about half of the 7.9 million net new subscriptions it added came from subscribers to Disney+ Hotstar, its Indian streaming service. Disney+ Hotstar customers account for about 50 million of the total Disney+ subscriptions. </p><p>   Before Wednesday's report, Disney shares were trading at two-year lows, and had fallen more than 30% so far this year. The reasons for Disney's nosedive have been threefold, analysts said: fears of a looming recession, overall stock market volatility and worries about the profitability of streaming. </p><p>   For the first year and a half of the coronavirus pandemic, the streaming video business model was the toast of Wall Street. Then last month, Netflix reported its first net subscriber loss in a decade, with some 200,000 customers pulling the plug. Those results sent Netflix shares declining by nearly 50%, erasing nearly $80 billion in market value at the world's biggest streamer and putting pressure on the shares of Netflix's streaming competitors. </p><p>   Disney, which launched its flagship streaming platform Disney+ just months before the pandemic hit, has reaped the fruits of streaming to the sofa-bound as well. The shift helped make up for Covid-19-related closures at its theme parks, which had been the best performing division of the company and have rebounded. </p><p>   But the company's emphasis on its streaming business could become a pressure point as consumers shift their behaviors amid high inflation and more options of where to spend their entertainment budgets, investors and analysts said. </p><p>   Sales at its theme parks and consumer products division -- which includes Walt Disney World and Disneyland resorts -- logged $6.65 billion in the quarter ended April 2, above analysts' expectations of $6.29 billion. </p><p>   \"The reason you own Disney, first and foremost, is the parks business,\" said Markus Hansen, a portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, which owns Disney shares. \"The obsession of the markets with streaming is a product of Covid. The parks, the bread and butter of the business, were shut down.\" </p><p>   Disney leadership wasn't asked any questions Wednesday about the Florida Legislature's recent repeal of a special tax privileges district that houses the Walt Disney World theme park. The district owes $1 billion in municipal debt, which is now entangled in a legal mess over how bondholders will be paid back. </p><p>   The bill repealing the tax treatment came amid controversy over Disney's response to Florida's Parental Rights in Education Bill, signed into law last month, which prohibits instruction in schools on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade. It limits instruction on those topics for older children to material deemed \"age-appropriate.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chapek initially chose to stay mum about what opponents call the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, but after pressure from some employees and critics, vowed to fight against the legislation and similar measures in other states. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Denny Jacob contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
