  "text": "<p>In 2019 I became the first female governor of South Dakota. To get there, I had to fight the good old boys club—men who told me repeatedly that it wasn't the right time for me and that I needed to wait my turn. This summer, I read Abby Wambach's \"Wolfpack,\" and it gave words to things I've always felt. The book's title refers to the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but Ms. Wambach turns it into a rallying cry: \"You were never Little Red Riding Hood. You were always the wolf.\" She writes about how women should build their own wolfpack—a group of women who not only defend each other and praise each other's victories, but also demand what they deserve. I don't believe anyone should get a position simply because she is a woman, but something incredibly powerful happens when women have each other's backs. Ms. Wambach's eight rules create a new playbook to change the way women think about leadership. I wish I'd had this perspective when I first ran for Congress in 2010, but I'm grateful I have it now.</p><p>Ms. Noem will begin her second term as South Dakota's governor in January.</p><p>Bozoma Saint John</p><p>In February, I made a big, scary change in my life. I left my role as the chief marketing officer of Netflix without another job lined up. It came after more than two decades of breakneck-speed career climbing at Endeavor, Uber, Apple and Pepsi. And suddenly, I stopped. It was the perfect time to pick up a book written by one of my best friends, Luvvie Ajayi Jones's \"Professional Troublemaker: The Fear-Fighter Manual.\" The book embodies the audacity we often need when we make the tough but right decision in life. I've been a disruptor in many spaces, and haven't been afraid to shake things up. But sometimes, we all need to borrow a little courage to do things differently. This book helped me do just that. As I prepare to publish my memoir, I've taken lessons from Luvvie's book to get ready to step into my new chapter and cause \"good trouble.\"</p><p>Ms. Saint John's memoir \"The Urgent Life: My Story of Love, Loss, and Survival\" will be published in February.</p><p>Asutosh Padhi</p><p>I've spent much of my career working with industrial technology and manufacturing companies, many of them in America's heartland. These institutions are defined by a resilient, innovative spirit, yet are underappreciated by the media, talent and investors. This may be due to the nature of their business—many are privately owned, invisible to everyday consumers, and few make it to the cover of papers like this one—but it's also, in part, due to their location. This is why one of the most energizing books I read this year was Steve Case's \"The Rise of the Rest.\" It chronicles Steve's journey to nurture tech startups in what some might consider \"surprising\" places. Think: Milwaukee vs. Silicon Valley. Over the past decade, 75% of venture capital has gone to just three states: California, New York and Massachusetts. But that doesn't mean those are the only places where innovation is happening. Steve's book is a heroic push encouraging us to widen the aperture. With the right investments and visibility, we can change the American landscape for the better, leveling the playing field and creating a more inclusive economy for years to come.</p><p>Mr. Padhi is McKinsey &amp; Company's North America Managing Partner, and co-author of \"The Titanium Economy: How Industrial Technology Can Create a Better, Faster, Stronger America\"</p><p>John Bel Edwards</p><p>At the beginning of this year, I had the great honor of signing a posthumous pardon for civil rights leader Homer Plessy, whose purchase of a train ticket in New Orleans led to the Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson decision upholding racial segregation and leading to generations of inequity in our country. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter in that case. When I signed the pardon for Plessy, Justice Harlan's family recommended \"The Great Dissenter: The Story of John Marshall Harlan, America's Judicial Hero\" by Peter S. Canellos. The book tells the story of a man who once himself owned slaves, had a complex family dynamic, and ultimately changed his own core values to become a defender of civil rights. It doesn't gloss over the harsh realities of our past, and shows what a lasting, profound impact we can all make by standing up for what's right.</p><p>Mr. Edwards is the governor of Louisiana.</p><p>Dave Limp</p><p>In my leisure reading I alternate between fiction and nonfiction, primarily to keep me from reading only fiction. My favorite novel this year was the recent \"Project Hail Mary\" by Andy Weir, a software-engineer-turned-writer best known as the author of \"The Martian\" (2011). It tells the story of an incredible interstellar adventure but stands out for its profound portrayal of friendship. I loved this book because it reinforced my optimism about people—and underscored that especially in a time when it seems we are more divided than ever, there is hope that people who are very different can get along and work together. My favorite nonfiction title was \"Einstein: His Life and Universe\" (2007) by Walter Isaacson. There is much to learn from this biography, but for me the big takeaway was just how many paradigm-shifting concepts Einstein put forward—from relativity to the foundations of quantum theory—despite the huge number of people who didn't believe them. It's an important reminder that truly innovative ideas are always worth pursuing—despite the objections of doubters.</p><p>Mr. Limp is the senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon.</p><p>Erika H. James</p><p>The book that most strongly stuck with me in 2022 was \"Lead to Win: How to Be a Powerful, Impactful, Influential Leader in Any Environment\" by Carla A. Harris. Ms. Harris paints a vivid picture of what's required of leaders today as our world has irrevocably changed. As a scholar who has spent a career studying crisis leadership and management strategy, I especially appreciated how Ms. Harris frames modern leadership through the lens of intentionality. These are the qualities that leaders need to hone and manifest every day in order to most effectively influence others and create positive change, things like authenticity, clarity, inclusivity and creating more leaders. The book reads with the same passion and charisma that Ms. Harris exhibits as an inspirational speaker. And it offers the practical \"pearls of wisdom\" that anyone can immediately put into action at any stage of their leadership journey.</p><p>Ms. James is dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of \"The Prepared Leader: Emerge From Any Crisis More Resilient Than Before.\"</p><p>Amy Klobuchar</p><p>In Minnesota, our landmark artists are often also literal landmarks. There is Duluth's Bob Dylan Way, St. Paul's Fitzgerald Theater, a statue of Sinclair Lewis in Sauk Centre. And in Minneapolis, just a few miles from Prince's star at First Avenue, there is Birchbark Books, which is owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Louise Erdrich. In Ms. Erdrich's latest novel, \"The Sentence,\" a bookstore inspired by Birchbark Books is brought to life—and is also haunted by a deceased customer. \"The Sentence\" is deeply personal and profoundly relevant, a fictional yet faithful account of the trials of the pandemic and the racial reckoning in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. It is a magical novel. But for anyone who took on the challenge of leadership during the last few years—in politics, business or elsewhere—it is a cathartic reminder to stay grounded in what is good and what matters, even when you don't have all the answers. If you're ever in Minneapolis, be sure to visit Birchbark Books. Until then, reading \"The Sentence\" will pretty much take you there.</p><p>Ms. Klobuchar is a senator from Minnesota.</p><p>David Malpass</p><p>Ian Bremmer's \"The Power of Crisis\" presents timely analysis of the overlapping crises we face today and potential transformative solutions. Mr. Bremmer, a leading geopolitical strategist, outlines three threats to global public goods—pandemics, climate change and ubiquitous digital technologies—to argue for practical coordination among nations and nonstate actors. The book is worth reading as the world faces a rapidly hardening impasse on many fronts, including the three that Mr. Bremmer highlights. I worry too about slow growth, high inflation, limited supplies and excessive national debt around the world. It's difficult to find an off-ramp when there is a permanent drain on global capital from advanced economies amid overcapitalized governments and businesses. To break the impasse, the world needs to overcome Mr. Bremmer's three threats to global public goods, rely even more on technological innovation and hope for an upheaval in economic policies to achieve broad-based growth that is less dependent on near-zero interest rates, Russian gas and Chinese coal-fired factories.</p><p>Mr. Malpass is president of the World Bank Group.</p><p>Lynn Martin</p><p>Recently I enjoyed reading \"Never Enough\" by Mike Hayes, chief operating officer of VMware. The book offers powerful lessons on teamwork and leadership under the most difficult circumstances. Mike is the former commanding officer of SEAL Team TWO, where he led a 2,000-person special operations task force in Afghanistan. Throughout the book, he shares moving stories of the bravery and sacrifice that he and his task force made for the protection of freedoms for our country and each other. Mike writes that \"high-performing teams—and not just in the military—succeed and fail together, with the best players understanding at all moments what will make the mission more successful and what role they need to play to enable that success.\" We all have an important role to play on our teams, and a true leader understands when it's time to provide direction and when it's time to let others step up. Importantly, all proceeds from the book go to the 1162 Foundation, which helps financially support Gold Star families after a service member is killed in action, making the read even more inspirational.</p><p>Ms. Martin is president of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Mike Evans</p><p>There are two fundamentals to leadership: set a vision and empower people. There's no shortage of business, personal and relational books related to either topic. Heck, even I wrote one. But the key to empowering people is to flip the script from trying to understand what others can do for you, and instead think about how you can understand and further their goals. What I'm talking about here is empathy. And it's something that we could all afford to practice more. So, my favorite book for this year has been \"Maid\" by Stephanie Land. This memoir by a single mother and poorly paid house cleaner is an engaging and powerful read. Ms. Land's personal journey helped me viscerally feel the weight of poverty, the inhumanity of the welfare state, and the indomitable nature of hope. Importantly, \"Maid\" helped me to see a life that's all too easy to ignore from the outside.</p><p>Mr. Evans, the founder of Grubhub and Fixer.com, is the author of \"Hangry: A Startup Journey.\"</p><p>William Barr</p><p>In \"How the World Really Works\" the distinguished Canadian environmental scientist Vaclav Smil distills a lifetime of erudition. The modern world's urban population, says Mr. Smil, has become disconnected from the material and energy requirements needed to sustain human life. His book explains the central role played by fossil fuels in achieving today's quality and security of life. Mr. Smil describes the massive extent to which fossil fuels are required to extract and produce the core materials—ammonia-based fertilizers, steel, cement and plastics—that are indispensable to feeding the world and building the machines and infrastructure on which modern economies depend. Mr. Smil agrees we should be moving away from reliance on fossil fuels, but he also argues we must move away from \"extreme views,\" especially the notion that we can decarbonize in just two or three decades. According to him this is a fantasy that ignores basic physical and material realities. Within the realm of the possible, he writes, \"one thing remains certain\" about transitioning to renewable energy: \"It will not be (it cannot be) a sudden abandonment of fossil carbon, nor even its rapid demise—but rather its gradual decline.\" Today's progressivism and its policy prescriptions—from transgenderism to its extreme Green agenda—have become increasingly disconnected from objective physical reality. This is odd for a creed rooted in historical materialism.</p><p>Mr. Barr, who served as U.S. attorney general in 1991-93 and 2019-20, is the author of \"One Damn Thing After Another.\"</p><p>Maria Salazar</p><p>In 1991, I was Central America's bureau chief at Univision, the most prominent network for Latin Americans in the United States. I covered the civil war in El Salvador, where the FMLN guerrillas used extreme violence against the state. Javier Zamora's childhood memoir, \"Solito,\" details his 3,000-mile journey alone from El Salvador to the United States. Reading about El Salvador brought back memories of the war, where ultimately my life was threatened. I sought protection at the American Embassy. My trust in America as a safe haven was instinctive—a blessing that I never questioned. Heart-wrenching and beautifully detailed, Mr. Zamora's story feels too heavy to have been repeated by anyone else. Truthfully, the U.S. holds millions of untold stories just like this one. Everyone should know what I knew in 1991—that America is both a refuge for those escaping violence and persecution, and fertile ground for hard-working immigrants with dreams of a better life. \"Solito\" is an unfinished story.</p><p>Ms. Salazar is a congresswoman from Florida.</p><p>Steve Case</p><p>Earlier this year, the Oracle Happiness Report showed that nearly half the global population claimed to have not felt true happiness since the start of the pandemic. A quarter said they had forgotten what it meant to be truly happy. These sobering statistics make \"From Strength to Strength\" by Arthur Brooks a most timely read. Mr. Brooks takes on the worthy job of advising us how to find greater inner purpose and happiness. The pandemic forced most of us to confront challenging questions about what we value and what makes us truly happy; this book helps us think through those decisions with the recognition that building a happy life, especially as we age, takes work. Mr. Brooks creates a detailed roadmap to happiness, not just from his own wisdom but from social science, eastern philosophy and interviews with others who have struggled with major life decisions. Rather than dwell on disappointment, this book reshapes our thinking to recognize that the best is yet to come.</p><p>Mr. Case, a co-founder of AOL, is the author of \"The Rise of the Rest: How Entrepreneurs in Surprising Places Are Building the New American Dream.\"</p><p>Kevin Hassett</p><p>When I finished \"The Myth of American Inequality: How Government Biases Policy Debate,\" my thoughts ran back to season 9 of the 1980s show \"Dallas.\" (Bear with me.) The entire season, you may recall, was revealed to be a dream—none of it happened. I have been participating in the public-policy debate with liberal and progressive scholars for years, but it all might just as well have been a dream. This book—by Auburn University economist Bob Ekelund, economist and consultant John Early, and former U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm—shows that the political debate over inequality since the 1960s has had almost nothing to do with reality. In short, the books were cooked. When the Census Bureau, which provides the source data everyone uses for inequality, calculates income, it counts only cash income. Nearly every transfer payment—money redistributed by the government for the purpose of attacking poverty—is left out! Once you include that money, the bottom half of the income distribution has almost exactly the same income from top to bottom. \"The Myth of American Inequality\" is in my view the most important book published this year.</p><p>Mr. Hassett is a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and was the 29th Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.</p><p>Surbhi Sarna</p><p>I've always used books to either better understand my current reality or escape it, and 2022 was no different. As I transitioned from being an entrepreneur to a venture capitalist focused on biology, I wanted to better understand how innovation in health care can go wrong. \"Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty,\" by Patrick Radden Keefe, tells the terrifying story of how one family's greed contributed to, and may have caused, the opioid crisis in the U.S. I also reread \"Bad Blood,\" by John Carreyrou, which pieces together the rise and fall of Theranos. It reminded me of the importance of keeping health entrepreneurs focused on the patients they ultimately serve. When I was done scaring myself, I turned to lighter reading. Andrew Shvarts's \"It Ends in Fire\" is about a strong heroine who becomes an undercover spy at a school that teaches magic as she plots revenge on the system that destroyed her family. Oh, 2022, what a year, and I'm grateful for the books that helped me get through it.</p><p>Ms. Sarna is a group partner at Y Combinator and author of the forthcoming \"Without a Doubt: How to Go From Underrated to Unbeatable.\"</p><p>Ed Stack</p><p>I love the saying \"It takes 20 years to make an overnight success.\" Many people don't realize how long it takes to become successful. \"The Ride of a Lifetime\" by Robert Iger and \"Play Nice but Win\" by Michael Dell help put the journey into perspective. For Mr. Iger, succeeding Michael Eisner as CEO of Disney was a challenge. Whether standing up to his predecessor or the Disney family, he was resolute in his vision. I can't wait to see how he navigates his next chapter as he shifts back to the CEO position. I was inspired by Mr. Dell's story of how, as a college kid with a passion for computers, he started a business. Like Mr. Iger, Mr. Dell never let his vision be dimmed by those around him who suggested he take a more traditional path. From the battle with Carl Icahn to take the company private to taking it public again, along with his acquisition strategy, he was definitely playing to win. Both books resonated deeply with my own experiences and are valuable for anyone trying to understand the importance of seeing around corners, staying true to your vision and never giving up.</p><p>Mr. Stack is executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods.</p><p>Mike Garcia</p><p>\"Red-Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win,\" by Peter Schweizer, is an eye-opening book that highlights a legacy of entanglement that senior U.S. government officials have had with the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, over the last couple of decades. It is particularly relevant to my work in Congress. I co-chair the China Task Force, which is trying to better understand the different ways in which the CCP takes advantage of the U.S. Mr. Schweizer's book provides a deep background on the relationship between the CCP and the U.S.—the entanglement between our officials and those of China's ruling party has led to the trading of our collective security for the short-term high of profit. If we want to avoid any further harm from that entanglement, we'd better figure out how to disentangle from the CCP—immediately.</p><p>Mr. Garcia is a congressman from California.</p><p>Reggie Fils-Aimé</p><p>As a business leader and board director, I'm always looking for practical books that teach important skills in a straightforward way. \"The Prepared Leader,\" by Wharton dean Erika H. James and Simmons University president Lynn Perry Wooten, does just that. The authors provide a research-rich framework and detailed set of tools to help leaders in any field overcome the faulty assumption that crises cannot be anticipated. While you never know exactly when the next problem will arise, every leader can apply critical thinking to anticipate potential issue areas and create a game plan. The authors encourage lateral thinking and diversity of opinion to enable ego-less decision making and quickly get to scalable solutions. It's an engaging read that you will bookmark and highlight to reread and apply.</p><p>Mr. Fils-Aimé, former president and COO of Nintendo of the Americas, is the author of \"Disrupting the Game.\"</p><p>Who Read What in 2022: Political and Business Leaders</p>",
