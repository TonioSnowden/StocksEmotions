  "title": "Yield-Starved Investors Snap Up Muni Bonds; Investors have put $39 billion into municipal-debt funds so far this year, the most over that period since 2008",
  "text": "<p>Demand is so intense that Illinois, the only state to tap the Federal Reserve 's pandemic emergency-lending facility, recently sold three-year bonds at yields near 1%. Another boost is coming from the Biden administration's proposed tax changes , which potentially can make municipal debt more attractive to investors. Considered almost as safe as Treasurys because they are backed by taxes or payments on essential services like water, municipal bonds typically offer interest payments that are tax-free.</p><p>The furor marks a reversal from the pandemic's lows. In the spring of 2020, cash-hungry investors dumped even safe munis at steep discounts . Many predicted tax collections would plunge and mounting financial distress would spur a wave of defaults. City and state borrowing froze. Defaults did climb , but investors started to return after actions by the Federal Reserve that April—including cutting interest rates and buying billions worth of bonds—buoyed the municipal-debt market and the economy. Tax collections exceeded expectations , state and local governments lifted revenue forecasts for this year and stimulus money from the federal government began flooding in.</p><p>Bank of America analysts in a recent note said the municipal market is entering \"a new golden decade of strong growth and strengthening credit quality.\" Moody's Investors Service raised its outlook for state and local governments to \"stable\" from \"negative\" after the passage of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill in March, saying the funds would stabilize state finances and help avoid funding cuts for local governments.</p><p>Investors will get a fresh look at the strength of the economy's reopening this week after Friday's disappointing jobs report , parsing earnings from Walt Disney Co . and delivery service DoorDash Inc ., along with new data on consumer prices and retail sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Friday at a new high.</p><p>Municipal bonds held up better than other fixed-income assets during the broader bond-market decline earlier this year. Munis returned 0.59% to investors this year through May 6, counting price changes and interest payments, beating a minus 3.22% total return on Treasurys and minus 3.1% on corporate bonds, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. Riskier high-yield munis have returned 3.87% over the same period, ahead of the 2.15% return on junk bonds from U.S. companies.</p><p>\"We made it through a tough year with very minor problems,\" said Dan Solender , director of tax-free fixed-income investments at Lord Abbett &amp; Co .</p><p>One factor driving recent gains, according to some analysts: State and local governments can't sell bonds fast enough for investors. Bond sales have increased so far this year compared with the same period in 2020, when state and local governments sold the most bonds in a decade  in an effort to manage pandemic costs.</p><p>Borrowers have sold $124 billion in new bonds this year as of Friday, according to Municipal Market Analytics. Meanwhile, refinancings and money paid back to investors totaled around $131 billion. That has led to a $7 billion mismatch, increasing demand for new bonds.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How are municipal bonds factoring into your investment strategy, if at all? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"We have money raining out of the sky,\" said Ben Watkins, director of bond finance for the state of Florida, referring to the favorable market conditions and stimulus aid. \"We're in a much better position now than if Covid hadn't hit at all.\"</p><p>Both state and local governments selling debt in recent months received favorable terms. Illinois saved millions of dollars in mid-March when it borrowed $1.26 billion. That included bonds due in 2024 sold at a 1.09% yield, below the 3.42% that the state is paying on similar-dated debt held by the Fed after it tapped the central bank's pandemic backstop program.</p><p>A $34 million Illinois bond rated triple-B minus—at the bottom of investment-grade—and due in 10 years recently traded for around 128 cents on the dollar, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access. It yielded 1.86%, down from 2.22% when issued in March.</p><p>\"There are just far more lenders than there are borrowers,\" said Matt Fabian, head of research at Municipal Market Analytics. \"That keeps municipal-bond yields pinned as low as you can go.\"</p><p>The average yield on 10-year triple-A-rated munis was 0.82% at Friday's close, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That is less than 0.2 percentage point above the record low yield of 0.68% from February, in data going back to 1993. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>While proposed federal infrastructure spending could ease the jam by putting local policy makers in better position to issue more muni bonds for other projects, many expect new demand for munis from wealthy households if the Biden administration's plan to raise capital-gains taxes advances in Congress. In a report to clients last week, analysts at UBS recommended that investors' consider buying munis over corporate bonds as one way to reduce taxable income. Changes to the tax code in recent years have cut down on other popular ways to limit taxable income, such as caps on state and local deductions.</p><p>Yields on 10-year triple-A-rated munis are currently around half of those on 10-year Treasury rates. Munis typically yield less than federal debt because of the tax advantage they provide. The current discount exceeds historical levels, a sign of investors' hearty appetite for the debt.</p><p>Such low yields limit the amount of income that investors can earn from holding muni funds after accounting for fees, said Mr. Fabian. This can drive some investors into cheaper alternatives or out of the market entirely. In a booming economy, investors tend to favor riskier assets such as stocks over bonds' fixed yields.</p><p>Jim Holihan, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management, said he favors munis with short-term maturities. In part, this is to limit the sensitivity of his investors' holdings to increases in interest rates and inflation, which erode the value of bonds' fixed payments.</p><p>\"It is a tough time for investors,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Sebastian Pellejero at sebastian.pellejero@wsj.com </p><p>Yield-Starved Investors Snap Up Muni Bonds</p>",
