  "text": "<p>Star Wars Stormtrooper helmets by artists including Sir Anish Kapoor and David Bailey have been photographed and turned into non-fungible tokens and marketed for millions of pounds without their consent.</p> <p>Curator Ben Moore took photographs of some of the helmets&#xa0;from a project called Art Wars, created by more than 300 artists since 2013, and put them up for sale for cryptocurrency as NFTs on the trading platform OpenSea yesterday. </p> <p>More than 1,600 ethereum (£5m) had been transferred since the collection of 1,138 images was put on sale yesterday. One NFT attributed to Kapoor was on sale for 1,000 ethereum but has since been removed from the site. Another work attributed to Bailey was on sale for 120 ethereum.</p> <p>About 12 artists are considering legal action against the project, according to legal representatives.</p> <p>A representative for Bailey said he had not given permission or received any proceeds of any sale. They said they would be looking into the matter. Kapoor's team declined to comment. </p> <p>Damien Hirst, whose work was included to promote the collection but not sold as an NFT, did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The Art Wars NFT page on OpenSea was taken down yesterday. </p> <p>OpenSea said it had received a copyright infringement notice and complied with it.</p> <p>The dispute highlights the debate around ownership of NFTs. Buyers of NFTs do not own the physical artwork and digital versions are sometimes sold without the original owners' permission, leading to conflict over intellectual property. </p> <p>Moore sent an email to artists on November 4 informing them of the collection, but some artists' lawyers said the emails went into their junk folders.</p> <p>Moore did not deny claims he created the NFTs without permission from the artists. “[Art Wars] regrets that some of the artists were taken by surprise, and have since expressed a preference not to be included. Of course, we've respected those wishes,” he said. Any artists remaining in the project would “receive royalties in the usual way”.</p> <p>Meanwhile a recording of Moore on social media yesterday appeared to show him wearing a Stormtrooper helmet, shooting a gun in the air and bragging about making “two mil on NFT”.</p> <p>Artist Helen Downie, who goes by the name Unskilled Worker, is among those threatening legal action&#xa0;after she found out that images of two of her helmets sold as NFTs through Twitter. </p> <p>“If exploiting artists' IP goes unchallenged, this behaviour will ruin and corrupt what is a truly exciting space for artists and collectors alike,” she said. </p> <p>Unskilled Worker's art was successfully removed from the OpenSea platform yesterday following a request. </p> <p>The Design and Artists Copyright Society said the minting of NFTs without artists' permission has the “potential to destroy how we, as a society value creativity”. It is making inquiries for several artists involved.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2cfc76ad-5e03-4230-97da-aae12a9681cb.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Cristina Criddle 2021 'Art by Anish Kapoor and David Bailey for sale as NFTs without their consent' FT.com 22 November.
