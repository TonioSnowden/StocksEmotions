  "text": "<p>Although the final antagonist in the latest DC Comics-inspired orgy of violence, wisecracks and visual effects is a gigantic starfish from outer space, we all know who the real rival is: Disney-owned Marvel Entertainment. Until now, the Mouse House's multiplatform array of comic-book content has pretty much eaten DC's lunch, both in terms of box-office success and critical reception.</p> <p>If this brand competition were a classic combat narrative, then the release of&#xa0;<em>The Suicide Squad</em>&#xa0;would be the bit where one hero switches sides. With the&#xa0;<em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> films, writer-director James Gunn injected a different energy into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with goofier, more whimsical comedy, hipper vintage-pop needle-drops and better writing for the female characters. After being dismissed from service (if only temporarily, he's back on board for&#xa0;<em>GOTG Vol 3</em>) when some embarrassing off-colour tweets emerged in 2018, Gunn jumped ship to DC to write and then direct this sequel to 2016's drearily nihilistic <em>Suicide Squad</em> (excepting the bits with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn). </p> <p>The result is a film considerably more entertaining than its predecessor, retaining the cold draught of bleakness that blows through the best of the DC Universe but with the visual brightness and romantic yearning that makes Gunn's work pop. Robbie's Quinn, a psychopath on a sugar rush in a Valentino red dress, is back and even more forward in the mix thanks to the success of her own vehicle, last year's surprisingly charming&#xa0;<em>Birds of Prey</em>. Once again she is teamed with a ragtag posse of supervillains, largely different from the ones who survived the first&#xa0;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, all forcibly united for another near-impossible mission under the direction of poker-faced governmental boss Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, having more fun this time.)</p> <p>It's as if focus groups had been consulted to finesse the character mix here. That means Joel Kinnaman's square-jawed good guy Rick Flag is held over, and to a lesser extent Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang. But the makers have swapped out Will Smith's sharpshooter and natural leader, whose teenage daughter is his Achilles heel, for Idris Elba, playing another sharpshooter and natural leader with a teenage daughter he cares about — a move which might seem pointless if it weren't for the fact that Elba is a vast improvement. Out goes largely computer-generated supporting character Killer Croc and in comes Nanaue or King Shark, another heavily-muscled interspecies cross with the voice of Sylvester Stallone.</p> <p>The most significant addition includes anti-hero Peacemaker (John Cena), a gung-ho America First warrior whose villainous side seems embedded in not-so-subtly-signalled rightwing attitudes. These are on full display given that the mission is to infiltrate a made-up Latin American island state undergoing a regime change in order to extract a resource (the aforementioned starfish from outer space) that could be useful to the US's interests — and who cares what happens to the locals. </p> <p>That stronger sense of topicality and political engagement raises the stakes, although it seems typically DC to push forward a morally murky anti-hero in their battle with Marvel (a Peacemaker TV series is already announced). Personally, I would have far preferred a spin-off revolving around killer-confetti-spraying nebbish Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), a character with arguably the most insane superpower in the multiverse, as well as the saddest eyes. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In UK cinemas from July 30, US cinemas from August 6</em></p><p>Source: Leslie Felperin 2021 'The Suicide Squad — more fun than last time but still with DC darkness' FT.com 28 July.
