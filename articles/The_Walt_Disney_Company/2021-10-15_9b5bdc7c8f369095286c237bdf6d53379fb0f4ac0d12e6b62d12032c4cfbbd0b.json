  "title": "Toy Executive Pushed Industry to Be Big-Screen Powerhouse; Brian Goldner, who died at age 58, persuaded Hollywood that Transformers and other Hasbro brands could be bigger entertainment properties",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Goldner waxed poetic about the franchise's characters and lore. When he was done, he often heard laughter, or silence, his colleagues have said. Hasbro, at the time, made toys for movies like \"Star Wars\"—not the other way around.</p><p>He eventually got buy-in from film director Steven Spielberg, who signed on as executive producer. The six Transformers movies have logged more than $4 billion in box-office sales world-wide, overcoming doubters—including some inside Hasbro—who advised him to stay away from Hollywood. \"I don't think I abided by that very much,\" Mr. Goldner had said.</p><p>Mr. Goldner, who would become chief executive of Hasbro in 2008, a year after the first \"Transformers\" movie, died Oct. 11 at his home in Barrington, R.I. He was 58 years old. The company and his family didn't disclose a cause of death. He had been undergoing treatment related to a 2014 diagnosis of prostate cancer. Hasbro said on Oct. 10 that Mr. Goldner was taking medical leave from his work duties.</p><p>He pushed Hasbro far beyond toys and deeper into entertainment using a strategy to build bigger audiences around Hasbro's brands through storytelling. That, in turn, would drive sales of toys, merchandise and more. During his 13 years as CEO, Hasbro's market value nearly tripled.</p><p>\"Storytelling is integral to everything we do,\" Mr. Goldner said in 2015.</p><p>Brian David Goldner was born April 21, 1963 in Huntington, N.Y., a middle-class suburb on Long Island, and grew up with his brother, Bradford Goldner. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother was an investment adviser.</p><p>He attended Dartmouth College, where he was a government major. He often was first to arrive for study group sessions. He worked at the college radio station, honing a voice that had the timbre of a DJ.</p><p>He started his career in advertising, and as a junior marketing executive at an ad agency, he caught the eye of Haim Saban, the media mogul behind the Power Rangers franchise. Noticing that Mr. Goldner had a knack for selling toys, Mr. Saban recruited him to the marketing division at Bandai America Inc., which had the license to make Power Rangers toys.</p><p>Mr. Goldner orchestrated marketing plans and release patterns for Power Rangers toys. He would later come to own one of the original White Ranger costumes. In a story he liked to tell, he put it on to surprise his son one day, only to find that he couldn't get the helmet off easily.</p><p>Mr. Goldner came to Hasbro in 2000, after he was recommended to then-CEO Alan Hassenfeld, whose family started the company in the 1920s, by Mr. Saban. He started at Hasbro's Tiger Electronics unit before moving to its headquarters in Pawtucket, R.I., where he soon became head of the U.S. toy division and later chief operating officer.</p><p>\"Brian, from the day I met him, was someone that I believed in another decade or so would be the CEO of the company,\" Mr. Hassenfeld said in a video tribute to Mr. Goldner.</p><p>Eventually, other Hasbro brands including G.I. Joe, My Little Pony and Battleship received the big-screen treatment. He led the acquisition of Entertainment One Ltd. in 2019, a production studio that also owns Peppa Pig and other children's properties.</p><p>When someone suggested that the Transformers characters shouldn't speak in the live-action film, Mr. Goldner interjected and spoke about how the robots are sentient beings with complex relationships. Peter Cullen, who voiced the character Optimus Prime, recorded the voice mail greeting for Mr. Goldner's cellphone.</p><p>He was known around Hasbro's offices as B.G., an executive who was affable and regularly greeted workers in the halls. He also had a competitive streak. \"We're not playing not to lose,\" he would often say. \"We're playing to win.\"</p><p>He made guest appearances at holiday parties with Hasbro's employee band, Toys 2 Men, playing his acoustic guitar. He liked to show off a video feed of his Bernese mountain dog, Biff, when he was at work or travelling.</p><p>For an industry known for plastic products, he pushed Hasbro to adopt environmental initiatives, including eliminating wire ties from packaging and launching a toy recycling program.</p><p>Mr. Goldner was a fan of playing tennis and other outdoor activities.</p><p>His survivors include his wife, Barbara, of more than 30 years; daughter, Brooke; brother, Bradford; and mother, Marjorie. He often visited his daughter at Dartmouth, where she attended college, to see showings of her theatrical performances.</p><p>The couple's son, Brandon, died in 2015 when he was 23 from an accidental drug overdose. They spoke publicly about their son's death and advocated for legislation in Rhode Island that created new treatment standards for substance abuse.</p><p>Though friends from college didn't imagine he'd wind up in the toy industry, Mr. Goldner's impact has been wide. \"He is an innovator who influenced the toy industry to convert itself to being an entertainment industry,\" Mr. Saban said, noting that other companies, including Mattel Inc., have followed the same plan. \"This is all Brian Goldner inspired.\"</p><p>Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com</p><p>Toy Executive Pushed Industry to Be Big-Screen Powerhouse</p>",
