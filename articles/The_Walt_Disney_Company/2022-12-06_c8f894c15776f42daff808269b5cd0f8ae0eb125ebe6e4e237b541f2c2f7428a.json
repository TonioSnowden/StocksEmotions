  "text": "<p><strong>Last Wednesday, on my bike ride </strong>to work, I felt my phone buzzing in my pocket. I&#xa0;dismounted to meet a deluge of Signals, Lines, WhatsApps, emails, DMs from fellow Nintendo fans, all sharing links to fresh treasure: the long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KydqdKKyGEk\">trailer</a> for <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>.</p> <p>It's been four years since we first heard that the film was in the works, and it won't be released until April. But the verdict from those who had checked out the 129-second taster was that Mario, the world's most valuable piece of entertainment intellectual property not owned by Disney, looks safe in the hands of <em>Despicable Me </em>creators, Illumination.&#xa0;</p> <p>But forget the film, it felt like a&#xa0;golden moment for trailers. We're&#xa0;in an era where, for a certain type of movie, expectation of future entertainment has become an experience in its own right. A perfect example of the tech-fuelled, endorphin-craving habits that shape&#xa0;the&#xa0;way we consume media.</p> <p>My phone gives me the capacity to study content instantly so I watched the trailer in the queue to order coffee. Then again as I waited for it to arrive. Then, just in case I'd missed anything, in the lift. In fact, by the trailer-makers' design, I <em>had</em> missed something. The whole clip is a cavalcade of arch little triggers and expansive fan service. Not merely to convince me to watch <em>Mario</em> on the big screen, but to infiltrate my dealings with all the other Nintendo nuts who are waiting to do the same.</p> <p>Sure enough, over the following 24 hours, the immense interpretive powers of the internet went to work on the trailer's DNA. An ecosystem of content evolved in real time around the original trailer, and continues to do so. Within an hour of its release, scores of new streams showed us influencers' reactions to seeing it for the first time.&#xa0;</p> <p>Within several hours, I could watch a variety of streams cataloguing the many “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN0Wvn1tTWo\">easter eggs</a>” (hidden, fleeting or near subliminal references to games and characters) I might have missed. Several of these required freeze-framing to capture. After half a day, I could rewatch the trailer, but now with the voice of actor Chris Pratt, who will provide Mario's voice in the movie, substituted by purist fans with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMhc7XjKJN8\">samples of Charles Martinet</a>, the man who has voiced Mario in over 100 different games since 1992 and who many believe should have done so in this film.</p> <p>The makers of trailers — particularly for titles like Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> — are expertly exploiting the sub-yearning their output now generates: a desire not only for the film, but also for the&#xa0;social media profile that can be&#xa0;built by those who participate in the run-up to it coming out.</p> <p>The corollary of this is intriguing. At one end, we have unprecedented fragmentation. The tech that has made it so easy to produce TikToks and repackage highlights from films and sport is dramatically shortening the entertainment units through which endorphin hits are delivered. This trend can be painful: football is already fretting over how to hook future generations on 90-minute matches, knowing that would-be viewers are used to much smaller bites of entertainment.&#xa0;But on the other hand, a pre-fragmented bit of content (the trailer) prompts massive global production and agglomeration of more content.&#xa0;</p> <p>I have now consumed, via the small screen of my phone, over two combined hours of content around a <em>Super Mario</em> movie that may be shorter than that when it finally hits the big screen. Mamma mia! &#xa0;</p> <p><em>Leo Lewis is the FT's Asia business editor</em></p><p>Source: Leo Lewis 2022 'Why I'm hooked on the ‘Super Mario' trailer' FT.com 6 December.
