  "title": "Disney CEO Tried to Avoid Politics, Now Finds Himself in Middle of Partisan Spat; Company paused political giving in Florida over legislation opponents call the 'Don't Say Gay' bill; CEO Bob Chapek tells employees, 'I am sorry'",
  "text": "<p>The Florida bill, which prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in certain grade levels at schools, has become a national flashpoint as opponents across the country and Mr. Chapek's own employees called on Disney to speak out against it. The family-entertainment giant became critics' primary target in recent weeks, since it operates Walt Disney World near Orlando and is among the state's most high-profile employers.</p><p>It was a week of damage control that ended with Mr. Chapek trying to assuage his staff and critics by announcing Disney was re-evaluating all of its political giving and begging his employees' forgiveness.</p><p>\"You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,\" Mr. Chapek wrote in the Friday letter.</p><p>Mr. Chapek has been CEO of Disney since February 2020, but he has been on his own as the company's top executive for less than three months, since his predecessor, Robert Iger, stepped down as executive chairman at the end of 2021. This past week offered the sharpest contrast yet between the two men. While Mr. Iger became a celebrity CEO comfortable with bringing progressive politics into the C-suite—and even toyed with running for president—Mr. Chapek has eschewed such public positions and rose through the ranks happy to let others have the spotlight, colleagues said.</p><p>This past week, however, he met a workforce that, like many in the U.S., expects public stances from its leaders. The tension turned Disney into another high-profile example of how national politics have seeped into nearly every aspect of corporate America—and a case study in how quickly the public perception of a company can change.</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Chapek said corporate statements against such legislation were counterproductive, and that his company's inclusive programming was the best tool it had in combating discrimination. When that caused the chorus of critics to grow louder, he spent a significant portion of his annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday backtracking, saying Disney had been opposed to the bill from the start and that he was personally lobbying Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to consider how it might hurt children.</p><p>Mr. Chapek's challenge doesn't appear to be over soon, especially as lawmakers in other states mount bills modeled after Florida's. Mr. DeSantis, speaking to supporters on Thursday, criticized Disney one day after Mr. Chapek said he had plans to meet with the governor and discuss the legislation.</p><p>\"The chance that I am going to back down from my commitment to students and back down from my commitment to parents' rights simply because of fraudulent media narratives or pressure from woke corporations? The chances of that are zero,\" Mr. DeSantis said.</p><p>He attacked Disney by name, saying it was hypocritical for the company to make money on family entertainment and then speak out against a bill designed to protect parents' rights. Mr. DeSantis even cited the company's work in China, arguing that Disney should answer for its business in a country with human-rights abuses.</p><p>Mr. DeSantis's national profile has risen in part thanks to conservative legislation like the Parental Rights in Education bill, which LGBTQ activists have said will cause harm to children struggling with their sexual and gender identity by cutting off support from teachers and encouraging teachers to out gay students to their parents. The bill's sponsors have defended it as a way of letting families deal with children's issues rather than teachers.</p><p>Disney employs tens of thousands of Floridians, primarily at Walt Disney World. Last year, it announced plans to move more of its southern California-based workforce to the state, which had offered generous tax breaks for the job relocations.</p><p>The company's political giving in Florida has included donations to politicians who supported the controversial Parental Rights in Education bill, which passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday.</p><p>Opponents of the bill cited Disney's political support for those legislators in their campaign against the company. Soon those outside voices were joined by Disney employees themselves, some of whom expressed their outrage with Mr. Chapek in public social media posts—a significant break from company culture at Disney, where employees are known to be ferociously loyal and sensitive to any breach in protocol.</p><p>Dana Terrace, the creator of the Disney show \"The Owl House\" said in a video posted on Twitter Monday that she was angry about Disney's backing of sponsors of the Florida bill, and said Mr. Chapek's memo was nothing more than \"flowery and compassionate words to shut you up.\"</p><p>The public pressure prompted Mr. Chapek on Monday to say he was staying out of it. \"As we have seen time and again, corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds,\" he said.</p><p>This came as a surprise to many Disney employees, who have fresh in their memories Mr. Iger's statements about a restrictive antiabortion bill proposed in Georgia in 2019. Mr. Iger suggested at the time the company would stop filming big-budget films in the state if it passed. He also weighed in last month on the Florida law, \"If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy.\"</p><p>Mr. Chapek's update at the Wednesday shareholder meeting—his first without Mr. Iger—only drew more criticism and overshadowed other updates on company business from the event. Mr. Chapek had announced Disney would pledge $5 million to LGBT causes—but then later that day, Human Rights Campaign, a prominent LGBT civil rights organization, said it would refuse any Disney donation \"until we see them build on their public commitment.\"</p><p>His note on Friday said the company would continue to spend money to advance such causes, though, a stance that could result in Disney having to do what Mr. Chapek said he initially wanted to avoid—and wade further into charged political debates.</p><p>\"You have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,\" he wrote.</p><p>Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com</p><p>Disney CEO Tried to Avoid Politics, Now Finds Himself in Middle of Partisan Spat</p>",
