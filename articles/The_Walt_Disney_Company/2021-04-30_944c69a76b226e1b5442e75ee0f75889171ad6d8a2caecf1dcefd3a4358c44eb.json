  "text": "<p>Having read about Abigail Disney and other billionaires (“The millionaires who volunteer for higher taxes”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e399f35-c8e7-4b86-a840-b54d28518a8d\">Report</a>, April 17) asking governments to raise taxes for their income group, I was disappointed to read that President Joe Biden's plans to do just that are being met with criticism and resistance. </p> <p>Could someone affected by these plans please write in and explain what on earth all this money they are currently not paying in taxes is spent on? </p> <p>Bearing in mind that those of us in the richest countries who earn the most are also the biggest polluters and consumers, isn't it time that the biggest earners willingly contributed more of their earnings to taxes and projects that support society more broadly, thus also decreasing their impact on the environment? </p> <p>Finally, the argument that a tax rise would discourage long-term investment seems counterintuitive: isn't investment in education and healthcare exactly that? </p> <p><strong>Kristina Mäki</strong> <br><em>Perugia, Italy</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Millionaires paying more tax, what's not to like?'
