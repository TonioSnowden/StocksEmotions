  "title": "Actress Phillipa Soo Is Returning to American History; The Tony-nominated star of 'Hamilton' is back on stage in a new musical about the suffragist movement.",
  "text": "<p>So she is thrilled to be back on stage for the first time in two years playing Inez Milholland, a trail-bllazing and fairly glamorous campaigner for women's rights, in \"Suffs.\" An epic musical about the American women's suffrage movement with an all-female cast, the show is now in previews at the Public Theater off Broadway, where it will premiere on April 6. The theater has already extended the show's run as tickets have sold out.</p><p>Like the Broadway smash \"Hamilton,\" in which Ms. Soo originated the role of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton—Alexander Hamilton's wife—\"Suffs\" animates a fraught moment of American history in a way that feels salient today. \"We've witnessed what happens when we don't understand how powerful our vote is or how difficult it was in the first place to get it,\" Ms. Soo says over the phone between rehearsals. She points out that the suffragists took to the streets at a time when the U.S. was grappling with a pandemic—the Spanish flu of 1918—and a war in Europe. \"They persevered,\" she says. \"We can too.\"</p><p>Growing up in Libertyville, Ill., an hour north of Chicago, Ms. Soo often delivered \"concerts\" in a tutu atop the family's coffee table for her brother and parents. She began dance classes at three and voice lessons in middle school, swiftly securing an agent and some work in commercials. She played top roles in high school productions, and for college she went to Juilliard: \"I got to New York with my three bucks, two bags and one me,\" she says, quoting a line from the musical \"Annie.\" \"I was just thrilled to be in the city.\"</p><p>Soon after graduating in 2012, Ms. Soo landed a starring part in an experimental pop opera adapted from \"War and Peace\" called \"Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812,\" which was being developed off Broadway. As Natasha, she was grateful to play a meatier role than the typical naive, lovelorn ingénue. Dave Malloy, the show's composer, has said that Ms. Soo convinced him to beef up Natasha's big song, \"No One Else,\" making it less sweet and more philosophical.</p><p>The performance earned Ms. Soo acclaim—critics described her as \"luminous\" and \"radiant\"—and brought her to the attention of Thomas Kail, the director of \"Hamilton,\" then a work in progress. Her experience as Natasha taught Ms. Soo how to sustain herself while delivering an emotionally demanding performance night after night. \"When you do a performance hundreds of times, you have to really make sure that you're taking care of yourself, your mind, your body, as much as you're taking care of the work at hand,\" she says.</p><p>\"There's a difference between crafting and maintaining a show,\" she adds. Once a musical has opened, the lines and blocking are fixed, but what she brings to a role often changes depending on the day. \"That's ultimately how I'm able to keep something fresh,\" she says. \"The challenge is to present the story like it's never been heard before.\"</p><p>These skills served Ms. Soo well as Eliza Hamilton, a role she originated in 2015, first at the Public Theater and then on Broadway. Her performance, which won her a Tony nomination for best actress. involved morphing on stage from a wide-eyed innocent into a grieving widow who mourns her husband's infidelity and untimely death, yet preserves his legacy and becomes a philanthropist. \"My own awe at her life, how involved she was, how resilient she was, comes into play in how I want others to see her too,\" she says.</p><p>\"Hamilton\" ends with Eliza's meditation on love, service, mortality and memory. After Disney+ released a live stage recording of the show in 2020, Lin-Manuel Miranda, its creator and original star, said on Twitter about Ms. Soo's final scene: \"What can be said in the face of such a performance? No words.\"</p><p>As the child of a Chinese father and a white mother, Ms. Soo says that she rarely saw actors who looked like her when she was younger. She can still recall how thrilling it was when Ang Lee's film \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" hit theaters in 2000. \"I just remember thinking, 'Oh, I'm connecting with this because I see myself in it,'\" she says. She now takes pride in helping to \"make room for unique stories, unique faces, unique bodies\" on stage and screen. In 2020 she was particularly moved by a video that went viral of a little Asian girl who pointed to Ms. Soo as Eliza on television and said, \"Look, it's me!\"</p><p>In some ways, Ms. Soo suspects that growing up biracial—\"existing in a between space, not one or the other\"—has been helpful to her as an actor. \"It's really hard for people to see stories from different angles, to hold multiple views at one time,\" she says. \"I've had a whole lifetime of practice at that.\"</p><p>While theaters were shut down, Ms. Soo kept busy on the big and small screens. She joined an all-Asian cast for Netflix's 2020 animated feature \"Over the Moon\" and played a pharmaceutical rep in Hulu's starry 2021 series \"Dopesick.\" She is a series regular in Apple Original's \"Shining Girls,\" a thriller premiering in late April. She also recorded quite a few fund-raising videos for arts organizations, sometimes with her husband, Steven Pasquale, a fellow actor, with whom she lives in Brooklyn.</p><p>\"Suffs,\" meanwhile, had been percolating on the back burner for years. Shaina Taub, the show's writer, composer and star, worked with Ms. Soo on \"The Great Comet\" and asked her to read an early draft in 2017. \"When she said she was making a show about the suffragists, I just thought, God, I'd love to be in that room,\" Ms. Soo says.</p><p>The show was supposed to open in late 2020. Postponed due to the pandemic, \"Suffs\" has evolved to better match the concerns of the moment, probing the suffrage movement's fissures along class, race and generational lines. At its center are some timeless questions: What is the best way to change society? Which compromises are worth making?</p><p>For Ms. Soo, returning off Broadway to originate a new role is at once familiar and exciting. \"I love the teamwork and being inside a process that feels extremely fervent with creative energy,\" she says, sounding a little like the suffragist she portrays. \"The fact that we're all gathered in one room to make and hear music together feels especially powerful right now.\"</p><p>Actress Phillipa Soo Is Returning to American History</p>",
