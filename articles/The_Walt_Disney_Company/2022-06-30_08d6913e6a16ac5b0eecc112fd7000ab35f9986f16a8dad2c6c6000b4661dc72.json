  "title": "'America the Beautiful' Review: Nature as Hero; In this Disney+ documentary, the ecological diversity of North America is the focus, from sea to shining sea.",
  "text": "<p>Monday, Disney+</p><p>There is plenty to crow about, of course, and this National Geographic series (being carried by parent Disney) crows lustily, unrestrained in its praise of the physical attributes of a sometimes fierce and fiercely varied landscape (amber waves of grain, fruited plains, etc.) and the \"heroes\" one finds throughout. If that seems an already overused word, \"America the Beautiful\" doesn't care: It applies the term to a squirrel guarding its pinecones and a duel to the death between arctic wolves and a musk ox (\"an ancient battle between two heroes of the frozen north\"). It seems debatable whether a fight for survival equals heroism, or that a creature unconscious of its own mortality can be a hero. But the theme runs through this wide-ranging production.</p><p>There has been some truly spectacular nature television in recent years, including \"Planet Earth\" and \"Frozen Planet,\" both of which involved married Britons Vanessa Berlowitz and Mark Linfield, the producers of \"America the Beautiful.\" Their new program breaks some fresh ground in the genre—the placing of cameras on fighter jets, for instance, which sweep a viewer almost magically from one ecosystem to the next (Mojave to Arctic, for instance). Ironically, the effect is to make a vast continent seem smaller—we get from here to there with the kind of alacrity a U.S. airline customer could only dream of. But the point of filmmakers Berlowitz and Linfield is geographic and zoological diversity itself, and that is punctuated by the north-south, east-west and sometimes diagonal trips to places that could be related only by being on the same contiguous land mass. The showrunner is Dan Rees (\"Frozen Planet,\" \"Atlantic\").</p><p>Despite or perhaps because of its placement on Disney+, \"America the Beautiful\" is not overly concerned with the \"Disneyficaton\" of the wildlife observed, which is difficult because the impulse of both filmmakers and viewers is to affix human motives to the conflicts of the natural world. A disclaimer at the end of episode 1 (titled \"Land of Heroes\") concedes that some of what we see was filmed under controlled conditions, while still being representative of real animal behavior. This seems fair: The viewer will impose the drama anyway, for instance when a monstrous American alligator stalks a white-tail deer at the edge of Louisiana's Atchafalaya swamp, or a grizzly bear and her young chase a herd of caribou and its own young across a river near Mount Denali in Alaska. In the case of the alligator, it may be obvious that the camera work is being done in a pool (the surface of the water bifurcates the image in a way that seems impossible in the wild) but it's also enlightening as regards just what's going on with that alligator both above and below the water.</p><p>People are not to be ignored in \"America the Beautiful,\" which visits a number of efforts to preserve or restore exploited geography—the American Prairie project, which is involved in \"rewilding the grasslands\" that once flourished across the wide midsection of the countries (the U.S. and Canada), or a campaign to get the Pebble Beach golf course to keep its countless golf balls out of the Pacific, where they pose a threat to marine life. In keeping with the upbeat spirit of \"America the Beautiful,\" the often modest crusades are consistently successful, the parties simpatico, though the rebuilding is not always the work of humans: In a visit to Mount St. Helens—where, we are reminded, a 1980 eruption \"blew up with the force of 25,000 atomic bombs and left a crater the size of 1,000 football fields\"—the wasteland once was as large as Chicago. Over the ensuing four decades, beavers have used the splintered lumber to create what Mr. Jordan calls a \"wetland paradise.\" One may be convinced, given the visuals of \"America the Beautiful,\" that these beavers, at least, may qualify as heroes.</p><p>'America the Beautiful' Review: Nature as Hero</p>",
