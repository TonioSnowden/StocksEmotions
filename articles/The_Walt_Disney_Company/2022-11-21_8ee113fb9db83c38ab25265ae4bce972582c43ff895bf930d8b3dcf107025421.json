  "title": "Disney Shares Rally as Former CEO Robert Iger Returns; Investors cheer return of longtime leader's steady hand to tackle issues and identify a successor",
  "text": "<p>Disney shares opened 9% higher at $100.12. In recent trading, they were at $99.03, up 7.9%.</p><p>Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson upgraded Disney shares following the executive change, recommending the stock for the first time since May 2020. Mr. Nathanson had been down on the shares for a number of reasons, including Mr. Chapek's commitment to what the analyst considered an unrealistic streaming strategy.</p><p>Mr. Nathanson said the returning Disney boss built the company into the global powerhouse it is today and should hopefully repeat that success as the entertainment giant navigates a tumultuous media landscape. He added that Disney and investors will appreciate Mr. Iger's demeanor, which provides \"a constant ballast in the roughest of media waters.\"</p><p>\"We believe investors will value the transparency and return Disney some of its long-lost magic with a stronger narrative driving the stock higher again,\" Mr. Nathanson said. He now rates Disney shares as outperform, up from a market perform rating.</p><p>Needham &amp; Co. analyst Laura Martin said Mr. Iger's return brings back a \"calming, patient, diplomatic\" style of handling internal conflicts along with a deft hand for dealing with public relations dust-ups, such as the controversy around the \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation passed in Florida earlier this year.</p><p>Before he stepped down as Disney's chief executive in February 2020 and shifted his role to executive chairman, Mr. Iger's 15-year tenure marked record profitability for the media mainstay. Disney's share price rose more than fivefold and its annual net income more than quadrupled during that time.</p><p>Shares have faced a rockier road since Mr. Chapek took over as chief executive, plummeting at the early onset of the pandemic before recovering alongside the broader market through early 2021, only to face a string of declines since. Even with Monday's early gains, shares are still down 35% this year.</p><p>Mr. Chapek previously said he expected the streaming business to be profitable by September 2024, although it lost nearly $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter. Disney's results have been buoyed by record performance and price increases for its theme parks and other divisions.</p><p>Ms. Martin said investors will expect Mr. Iger to right the streaming ship and moderate the division's losses more quickly than Mr. Chapek could.</p><p>Mr. Iger rejoins as CEO on a two-year contract, during which he is expected to develop a strategy to reignite growth at the company and develop a successor.</p><p>Wells Fargo analysts said they were less surprised with the ousting of Mr. Chapek than with the return of Mr. Iger. Still, they were pleased with the move, as reinstalling the former CEO \"puts perhaps the best leader in media at the helm with a mandate to shake things up.\"</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Shares Rally as Former CEO Robert Iger Returns</p>",
