  "text": "<p>\"It is who we are and it is who we are destined to be,\" Ms. Redstone said. \"And that is why today we are thrilled to announce that ViacomCBS has become Paramount Global, or simply Paramount.\"</p><p>ViacomCBS said the name change would take effect on Thursday, adding that the company's new ticker symbols would be PARAA for class A shares and PARA for class B shares.</p><p>The move is the latest indication that media companies are increasingly shifting their attention from traditional television toward video streaming, which shows more potential for growth.</p><p>Both Walt Disney Co. and AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia reorganized themselves to focus on their streaming services -- Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu for Disney, and HBO Max for WarnerMedia.</p><p>Comcast Corp., meanwhile, has made building the subscriber base of Peacock a priority, as the company is looking to become a streaming giant in its own right. Comcast doubled its content spending for Peacock to $3 billion this year.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Bakish said that the decision to rename the company was inspired by earlier research into renaming the CBS All Access streaming service. The company found that the Paramount name was recognizable globally and evoked quality among respondents. The new name also promotes the streaming service, Mr. Bakish said.</p><p>\"Now anytime we talk about our company, we have the association with our flagship service,\" Mr. Bakish said.</p><p>When asked whether he thought ViacomCBS would look to acquire assets like Starz or AMC Networks Inc., Mr. Bakish said in the interview that he didn't find them \"particularly interesting in the context of what we have.\"</p><p>ViacomCBS on Tuesday said its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, added 7.3 million subscribers in the latest quarter to reach 32.8 million total subscribers. Paramount+ is vying for streaming subscribers in a field that has become increasingly cutthroat. Netflix Inc. added 8.3 million subscribers in the latest quarter, missing its own projections of 8.5 million, while Walt Disney Co. reported 11.8 million new Disney+ subscribers.</p><p>ViacomCBS, which has streaming services for Showtime and BET as well as the children-oriented service Noggin, said it has 56 million total streaming subscribers.</p><p>Overall, the company said net profit rose to $2.06 billion, or $3.11 a share, from $810 million, or $1.31 a share, a year earlier Revenue rose 16% to $8 billion, boosted by strong streaming-subscriber growth.</p><p>ViacomCBS also said its popular \"Yellowstone\" cable series would expand, extending the next season of the show by four episodes. The show's fifth season will be split into two installments of seven episodes each, and used to launch several new streaming shows.</p>",
