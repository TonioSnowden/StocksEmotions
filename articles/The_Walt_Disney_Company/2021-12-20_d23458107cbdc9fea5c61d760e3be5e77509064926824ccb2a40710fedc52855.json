  "title": "Inspiring Walt Disney at the Met — from Meissen to the Magic Kingdom",
  "text": "<p>Just about anyone who's ever been (or had) a child knows that in the Disney universe carpets flirt, clocks sing and castles stretch moodily into the sky. Over the past century, the company has manufactured a complete world in which sentient objects and emotionally charged architecture collude to tell a story. <em>Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts</em>, an effervescent and slyly profound new exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, makes the case that the man — and the cultural juggernaut he created — was a crucial interpreter of European art for America's global cultural empire. Disney taught the world's children how to feel by showing them how to see.</p> <p>To keep the argument intact and the focus tight, curator Wolf Burchard confines his explorations to four films: <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> (1937), <em>Cinderella</em> (1950), <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (1959) and <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> (1991). It's more than enough. Drawing from the studio's formidable archives and the overflowing vaults of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/165f036e-73de-11e8-bab2-43bd4ae655dd\">Wallace Collection</a> in London (where the exhibition travels next spring), Burchard moderates a dialogue between Disney's gifted animators and 18th- and 19th-century artisans, who injected wit and virtuosity into sophisticated consumer products.</p> <p>The Met leverages the ingenuity of the French rococo to sharpen our appreciation for illustrators in Burbank — and vice versa. Curvaceous couches from paintings reappear onscreen; we trace the lineage of talking candlesticks back to their ancestors in vitrines. All these objects — elephant vases from Sèvres, a tiny diamond-studded golden chariot, a porcelain pig playing the harpsichord — inhabit the terrain between animate and inanimate, the border zone between adorable and uncanny.</p> <p>Disney wasn't content with a few brushstrokes of aesthetic varnish; he demanded consistency at every scale, from the tiniest doodad to the grandest panorama. To get it, he hired a corps of erudite perfectionists, people such as Bianca Majolie and Mary Blair, who combed through centuries' worth of art and architecture and decor and tapestry and porcelain and garden design, hunting for details that would help tell a story. The company's art-historical scouts settled on a few especially rich moments when craft, technology, power and self-invention converged into a highly theatrical aesthetic. </p> <p>Burchard comes to the project with a similar taste for thoroughness. Anything with Disney in the title could have been an excuse to pack in kids and their obligatory adults, run some movie clips and gin them up with a little art-historical jargon. Instead, the Met has mounted a tour de force of provocative but persuasive scholarship, arguing that Disney was as influential as any mega-museum in educating the modern masses on the aesthetics of earlier elites. You may not know Meissen from Mickey Mouse, but the forms of 18th-century porcelain dancing figures are part of the Disney DNA — which means they've probably infiltrated yours. Even a child can see the kinship between, say, Lumière from <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> and Meissonier candelabra. </p> <p>Close to the entrance, we see home movies of the Disney family's 1935 visit to Paris. The clan lingers in Versailles, the ultimate palace-as-theatre, designed to project the divine attributes and exquisite taste of the nation's ruler — and also to help the court escape the grittier realities of life in a poor agricultural economy. Walt had no patience for European snobbery but he adored its artefacts and accumulated an impressive collection of miniature tools and dollhouse furniture.</p> <p>As the exhibition makes clear, he and his successors also understood what to cut and when to shift gears. They accepted the need to leave enormous quantities of labour without fulfilment, if that's what a story demanded. Burchard doesn't have the same editorial ruthlessness, which sometimes gets in the way of clarity. The title suggests France was more influential on the Disney universe than, say, Germany, a premise the contents contradict. And a lot of wall space follows a contingent of Disney artists down a rather beautiful dead end.</p> <p>In 1989, the directors Richard and Jill Purdum convened a team to develop <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. The story was written in the 18th century, and that's when the Purdums wanted to set it. Cogsworth the major-domo came as a liveried grandfather clock, similar to one that André-Charles Boulle designed in the 1720s. Mrs Potts evolved from a similarly ornate porcelain teapot of the same era. </p> <p>In the end, Disney chair Jeffrey Katzenberg hated the whole concept, finding <em>ancienrégime</em> France fussy, boring and undramatic. Costumes and decor were radically simplified, and the setting relocated to a mishmash of eras. Burchard seems regretful that Katzenberg put the kibosh on the 18th-century version: all that gilt, all those wigs and velvets and scrolls, all that pastoral bewitchment gone to waste! But the truth is that the museum's focus on a rococo connection is a bit of a stretch in any case. As multiple generations of fantasy film-makers have discovered, the romantic neo-medievalism of the mid-19th century was a much more cinematic movement. </p> <p>Close your eyes and think of Disney. What do you see? A castle springing upward like a sugar-coated Christmas tree, its floating turrets and towers reaching for the sky. That flamboyant structure takes centre stage in theme parks from Anaheim to Paris to Shanghai. To some, it's a beacon of soothing optimism, to others a symbol of global corporate brainwashing. The Met stays away from political interpretation, seeing it instead as a piece of potent American whimsy inspired by a European one.</p> <p>The precursor to the Disney castle is Schloss Neuschwanstein, which King Ludwig II erected on a Bavarian hilltop in the 1870s as an homage both to his own impotent grandiosity and his favourite fabulist, Richard Wagner. The composer/librettist/impresario was 19th-century Germany's Walt Disney, a stage magician who blended medieval tales and contemporary technology into a new form of entertainment. Which is to say: the Magic Kingdom is a reproduction of a real place based on a fantastical evocation of a hoary myth.</p> <p>The power of that lineage — and the real takeaway from the Met's extravaganza — is that at each phase, imagination produced a vivid, fully enveloping world, with none of reality's sloppiness and disappointment. Walt Disney saw that a megalomaniac's private obsessions could expand into universal delights.</p> <p><em>To March 6 2022, </em><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/inspiring-walt-disney\"><em>metmuseum.org</em></a><br></p><p>Source: Ariella Budick 2021 'Inspiring Walt Disney at the Met — from Meissen to the Magic Kingdom' FT.com 20 December.
