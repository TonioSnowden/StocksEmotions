  "text": "<p>The five-year-old who spent 2014 singing along to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/636ab7e0-2036-11e7-b7d3-163f5a7f229c\"><em>Frozen</em> </a>will now be at a different point of childhood. Once that would have meant a break with makers Disney. Now the studio seeks to keep hold of the tweens with <em>Cruella</em>, a reimagined live-action origin story starring Emma Stone as the fiendish de Vil. </p> <p>The movie comes heavily trailed as a tribute to punk, and so it is, sort of. The setting is 1974, a little early but with enough blurred edges to double as '76, the year of “Anarchy in the UK”. The small print of the timeline may not much interest the demographic the film is made for. Good. This witty, glittery movie works precisely because it knows its audience should absolutely be clever 12-year-olds, not ageing pedants who now listen to The Sex Pistols in the car. (Don't judge me.)</p> <p>The premise finds Cruella a rascally orphan with a love of couture, a trace of Vivienne Westwood in a tale of warring fashion designers. But something old-world lives on too. The backdrop is a London as wide-eyed as a child's first glimpse from a train window. Regent's Park, Portobello Road, Waterloo Bridge: all are rendered with the splendour of a $200m pop-up book. A day job is soon found at department store Liberty, quite the slab of product placement. Home is a bomb site squat. Grander digs — I'd say St James's Park — are enjoyed by the Baroness (Emma Thompson), a nightmarish designer with a train of terrorised flunkeys. The Dalmatians are hers too.</p> <p>Cruella first becomes her loyal assistant, then a less loyal one. The primal wound of her childhood bides its time. The mood, thankfully, is pure pop. Not for this movie the egregious dirge of that other supervillain do-over, <em>Joker</em>. The new film is better made too, slick as a high-end blockbuster should be. Five writers are credited, between them supplying internal logic and neatly throw­away lines for an able supporting cast. </p> <p>The script makes sturdy bones for the costumes, scene-stealing of course, their mad dazzle matched by the set pieces. The film's liveliest stretches see our anti-heroine launch spectacular thefts of fashion-world attention, bin lorries gatecrashing gala shows. The vim is infectious. Far from the norm with a film of this corporate significance, it can seem like the people making it are actually having fun.</p> <p>But nothing kills fun like too much of it. The snag with <em>Cruella</em> is as simple as that, a running time 30 minutes too long. The drift makes life tricky for Stone. To play a character who is half-cartoon can be a trap for actors — <em>cough</em> Joaquin Phoenix — and for all the charm of her scrappy, zigzagging performance, diminishing returns kick in. </p> <p>Luckily Thompson excels, playing a woman viciously keen not to be upstaged while in fact subtly supporting the headliner. Her work is as sharp as the straight razor her character makes alterations with. Drawing blood from a bystander, she stops only to ask: “Can you get me a red like that?” The flunkeys gasp — stunned to hear it phrased as a question rather than an order. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Disney+ and at UK cinemas from May 28</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Cruella — Disney classic given a new leash of life' FT.com 26 May.
