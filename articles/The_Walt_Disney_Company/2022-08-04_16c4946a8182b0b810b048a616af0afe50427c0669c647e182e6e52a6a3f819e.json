  "title": "'Luck' Review: Animated by Misfortune; This movie, from John Lasseter's production company, features the voices of Jane Fonda, Whoopi Goldberg, Simon Pegg and others to tell the convoluted story of an orphan who finds herself transported into the world of leprechauns",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>The idea that luck—serendipity, prosperity, fortuity—would be connected to Ireland, a land whose history spells anything but, is just one of the tired ideas permeating an overlong animated feature that suggests the style of Pixar, which Mr. Lasseter departed several years ago. (In 2019, he took the helm at Skydance Animation, which made this film with Mr. Lasseter as a producer.) The bigger problem is there are too many ideas, and fantastical solutions to manufactured problems, most of which feel as if they're being made up as the movie goes along. This is largely the fault of screenwriters Kiel Murray, Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel, but they didn't conjure up the movie by themselves. (The director is Peggy Holmes, who has made several entries in the \"Disney Fairies\" series.)</p><p>In \"Luck,\" a chronically unfortunate young woman named Sam Greenfield (voice of Eva Noblezada) travels through a shamrock-shaped portal to the Land of Luck, which looks like an overly ambitious Apple store and features magical pigs creating the crystals that become the lucky pennies that bestow good luck upon humanity—but not before they go through the \"Randomizer\" that scatters the good luck, at random, throughout the world. So life is a crapshoot? Or not? Never mind. What's more off-putting than the convolutions of plot and the oppressive nature of the film's security leprechauns is the plight of Sam, and her rather depressing and casually clueless backstory</p><p>When we meet her, she's just turned 18. Which means she's aged out of the Summerland Home for Girls—an orphanage—after a lifetime of disappointments, canceled visits with prospective new parents, and not being adopted. \"I guess we weren't lucky enough to find you that forever family,\" says her forever social worker, and the situation—given the realities of foster care and adoption—is slightly ridiculous. Did she create mayhem at every home she visited? (She does have an uncanny gift for dropping the toast jelly side down.) Did the prospects think that her chronic bad luck was contagious? We don't know, so we're left to blame a child's lifetime alone on a crazy roll of the cosmic dice, which seems cruel even to an animated character.</p><p>It all begins to change when Sam feeds a stray cat, who turns out to be Bob (Simon Pegg), a Scots-accented emissary from the L of L whose lost lucky penny suddenly changes everything for Sam, including her toast. (There's a joke in there about \"sticking the landing,\" but why digress?) She wants to give the penny to Hazel (Adelynn Spoon), the little girl she left back at Summerland, but Bob needs it to get back to the Land of Luck, where Sam decides to follow. There, matters grow enormously more confusing en route to a massive crisis in the universe of good and bad luck and a Sam-powered resolution of same. Humans aren't allowed in the Land of Luck, and Sam becomes a liability to Bob, and a target of suspicion for the security chief known as The Captain (Whoopi Goldberg). Being from the outside world, she's also an object of intense curiosity for the better-natured little people, one of whom, Gerry (Colin O'Donoghue), is awed. And has a question: \"Have you ever tried . . . grilled cheese?\" It's the funniest line in the film, which may be saying something.</p><p>A number of familiar names bring their voices to \"Luck,\" including Jane Fonda as the Dragon who rules the realm of good fortune; and John Ratzenberger as Rootie, bartender to the \"roots and goblins\" who create bad luck. Also in the voice cast are Lil Rel Howery as Marv, the storeowner who gives Sam her first job, and Flula Borg as Jeff the Unicorn, whose real name is Heimdall and who sounds like a Teutonic Paul Lynde. He's funny, too, but finding genuine mirth in \"Luck\" is really a chance encounter.</p><p>'Luck' Review: Animated by Misfortune</p>",
