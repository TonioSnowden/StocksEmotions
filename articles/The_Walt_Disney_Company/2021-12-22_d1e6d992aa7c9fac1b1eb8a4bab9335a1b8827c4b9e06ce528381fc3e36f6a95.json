  "text": "<p>“And then the sun came out!” exclaims Lin-Manuel Miranda as he vanishes into a halo of light. A moment ago on a Zoom call from New York, the <em>Hamilton</em> creator was describing directing his film musical <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4a963ed-95bb-4032-ab5f-581fe23e4dea\"><em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em></a>. One afternoon in September 2020, Miranda sat in an empty Majestic Theatre on Broadway. A prop chandelier lay where it had fallen after the last performance six months before. It didn't feel hysterical to ask if all of it — the stage world from which Miranda had come — was dead.</p> <p>Now, out of nowhere, a sunburst dazzles through the window behind him. Such is the knack of Miranda, 41, for the well-timed uplift of musical theatre that you might assume he was responsible. But reality is complex. If theatre and cinema have made comebacks since last year, they are now imperilled again by Omicron. Also, neither of us can see properly. “I'll draw the curtains,” he says. </p> <p>Still, real happy endings do occur. Filming on <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em> — the memoir of another writer of vastly popular musicals, Jonathan Larson — wrapped without a single case of Covid. “Joel Grey was not getting sick on my watch,” Miranda says of the <em>Cabaret</em> legend who cameoed alongside star Andrew Garfield. The film was released to acclaim in November. </p> <p>It has been a quirk of the past two years, so treacherous for stage and screen, that they have also involved a wealth of Miranda product. In summer 2020, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1f9e780-209c-4b12-b0ff-ace4a7ddb364\">filmed version of <em>Hamilton</em></a> was released to streaming. In June this year, reopened cinemas played host to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45a3a135-f151-474f-8fa9-c4adfddda196\"><em>In the Heights</em></a>, the movie of his first musical. (He played the lead on Broadway; now he produced and took a supporting role.) </p> <p>In August came <em>Vivo</em>, an animated hit for which he wrote the songs and voiced the lead character. Last month, he also provided the soundtrack for Disney's <em>Encanto</em>, as well as releasing <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em> “I'm sorry for the crush of Lin-Manuel Miranda,” he says, although you suspect he knows his vibrant brand has been welcomed by audiences in dark times.</p> <p>Covid only heightened the urgency with which he shaped his career. “I've always felt like: ‘Please someone put this show onstage. Because if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, it will never get out of my head.'” The same drive defined <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em>, written when Larson was an unproduced 30-year-old composer working in a Manhattan diner before his breakthrough project, <em>Rent</em>. </p> <p>Seeing that show would be life-changing for Miranda, who was thrilled as a teenager by the reinvention of the musical as something that “sounded good coming out of your car”. But Larson himself offered the starkest reminder of the need to get work finished. In 1996, before <em>Rent</em> became a sensation, he died at 35 from the rare Marfan syndrome. Miranda admits Larson's early death has haunted him. “The clock is always ticking. And yet to write a musical takes years. That's a tough tension to hold on to.”</p> <p>His CV is what happens when a workaholic meets an endless market for their ideas and opportunities as performer-for-hire. Why and when does he say no? “The judgment is always: ‘What can I learn from?' As an actor, every film in the last few years has been prep for directing <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em> I say yes to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfa94a5e-0387-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3\"><em>Mary Poppins Returns</em></a> because I want to watch Rob Marshall direct a musical.”&#xa0;</p> <p>There can be other factors, too. That film also enabled his family to spend time in London. Miranda says that while his wife, attorney Vanessa Nadal, loves international travel, “I literally wrote my first musical about never wanting to leave Washington Heights [the northern Manhattan neighbourhood where they live].” The dynamic shift again in 2022. “After I talk to you, I have an empty desk. Next year I just write and take the kids to school. And [my wife] gets to be a lawyer.”</p> <p>The break is interestingly timed. <em>Hamilton</em> debuted in January 2015. In the seven years since, its phenomenal success has not only kept Miranda's diary full, it has made musicals the hottest ticket in culture. On screen, the genre hovers on the brink of being inescapable, his own output and Steven Spielberg's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb9fc43-0bd8-451d-a405-f55b074d2511\">remake of <em>West Side Story</em></a> just the year's foremost examples. But such things are cyclical. Miranda fell for musicals in an era when they were all but extinct in cinema. (He watched <em>Singin' in the Rain</em> instead.) “Musicals will go out of fashion again,” he says, without notable panic. “You can't control what the world does with this thing you make.”</p> <p>In conversation, Miranda can seem like the freestyle rapper he still sometimes moonlights as, fluent answers starting on the last beat of a question. They often have the expansive energy of an awards acceptance speech. There are name checks for friends he will love forever, colleagues who made a scene 500 times funnier. Behind him, this implies, is a grand ensemble, from Nadal and his parents — his father Luis is a renowned political activist — to his whole neighbourhood. Miranda paints it as a bustling idyll. “In Washington Heights, I'm a local character and village idiot. Everyone knows I get lyrics walking, so people are used to seeing me with my headphones on, talking to myself.”</p> <p>Beyond friends, family and neighbourhood, his “circle of concern” has narrowed, he says. Once he was rarely off social media; now a team member controls his passwords. “Twitter is dangerous for someone who enjoys the dopamine rush of an audience in my pocket,” he says. Written when he had only&#xa0;recently&#xa0;stopped working as a substitute teacher, <em>Hamilton</em> gave Miranda a platform to speak on issues profound and less so, from Puerto Rican debt relief to diary-like tweets dubbed #Hamilthoughts. “<em>Hamilton</em> will be the first line of my obituary no matter what else I do. I try to see that as freeing and not a burden.”</p> <p>Much of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fc996e4-b07c-11ea-94fc-9a676a727e5a\"><em>Hamilton</em> effect</a> involved convincing a generation that musicals could be cool. (On this, Miranda is an inch from prickly: “They were never not cool to me.”) It was also a political <em>cause célèbre</em> — and a landmark for Latin culture. Again, we live in complex times. <em>In the Heights</em> faced criticism this year for a lack of Afro-Latin characters; in 2020, <em>Hamilton</em>'s take on US history was accused of glossing over slavery. Miranda says he welcomes an evolution in our understanding of race and progress. “Stop evolving and you're dead. Didn't Darwin teach us that?</p> <p>“I have a staff now,” he goes on, “and three-quarters of them are devoted to philanthropy.” He speaks of “creating debuts” for performers and “widening doors” for audiences. “With Broadway, there's an economic barrier. <em>Hamilton</em> had the most expensive tickets on Broadway <em>and</em> the cheapest.” He would like more affordable tickets, he says, and better outreach putting them into the right hands.</p> <p>Miranda's overall project has embraced both the grassroots and corporate entertainment giants. His films have seen him work with Netflix — backers of <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em> — Sony, Warner Bros and Disney. The latter also released <em>West Side Story</em>, a film in which Miranda admits particular interest. (“I directed my version as a high school senior.”) It was shot, in the summer of 2019, mere blocks from <em>In the Heights</em>. </p> <p>He offers another scene that might have been scripted. On a blue-sky July day, the finale of&#xa0;<em>In the Heights</em> was shot on 175th Street. Then, with the sun setting, an old school friend working on <em>West Side Story</em> accompanied Miranda to 177th. There the crew were preparing to film showstopper “Maria”. Spielberg, a childhood hero, briefly approached him to exchange notes. “He told me: ‘I'm a student making musicals.' And then I walked home. I would call that a top-five day.”</p> <p>Of course, musicals are also often touched by melancholy. Near the end of Miranda's frantic year came the death of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b5dc333-70f5-4c71-b371-e44fb2015b2b\">Stephen Sondheim</a>. The <em>West Side Story</em> lyricist was a mentor to Larson; he appears as a character in <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em> Miranda and Sondheim became close too. </p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/827433516480811008\">https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/827433516480811008</a> <p>“When the film came out, I emailed to say I hoped his ears were burning from how many stories people were sharing on social media about his mentorship. He wrote back to say: ‘Lin, your email lifts my spirits. That is a part of my life I'm proud of.'” Sondheim died a week later. He was 91.</p> <p>If <em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!</em> portrays the struggling artist at 30, Miranda is already beyond that. The fear of promise cut short has been replaced by different pressures. “I've made work about life being short, but life can also be long. That's what I'm grappling with now. Because this moment is fun — knowing the work has connected. But in some ways it's only opening night.”</p> <p>‘<em>Tick, Tick . . . Boom!' is on Netflix and ‘Encanto' is in cinemas now</em></p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Lin-Manuel Miranda: ‘Musicals were never not cool to me'' FT.com 22 December.
