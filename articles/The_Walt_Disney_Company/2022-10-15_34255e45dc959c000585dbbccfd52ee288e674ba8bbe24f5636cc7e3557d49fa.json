  "text": "<p>   Growing up as a gay Indian kid on the posh island of Key Biscayne, Fla., outside of Miami, Soman Chainani sensed he didn't fit in. He felt alien among his mostly white peers, and overlooked by the Disney films he watched until he knew every frame. \"I remember not seeing myself in anything,\" he says over video from his home in Manhattan. Unable to identify with beautiful princesses or lucky princes, he felt an uneasy affinity for the witches and scoundrels, who were often more crafty and complex: \"I was always secretly rooting for the villains, because I felt more of a kinship with them.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chainani, 43, would later learn that the original folk tales Disney adapted for animated films were often darker, stranger and more violent, with heroes who were rarely morally pure and some that even died in the end. He found in the grisly yarns of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm a more nuanced appreciation of good, evil, luck and hubris. \"I realized that fairy tales were meant to do something other than engender jealousy or resentment in those of us who don't get the happy ending,\" he says. </p><p>   With \"The School for Good and Evil,\" his bestselling series of young-adult fantasy novels, Mr. Chainani says he is trying to evoke these early folk tales by giving readers more room to figure out right and wrong for themselves. \"I wanted to get away from a storytelling structure in which there's a good guy you're supposed to empathize with and a bad guy who shows up every 10 minutes to say 'boo' and then comes back to die at the end,\" he says. </p><p>   The series, which now includes six titles, has sold more than 3.5 million copies in 31 languages since its debut in 2013. A film adaptation directed by Paul Feig and starring Charlize Theron, Kerry Washington, Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Yeoh will premier on Netflix on Oct. 19. </p><p>   At the center of \"The School for Good and Evil\" is a pair of friends, Sophie and Agatha, who are whisked away from the fictional village of Gavaldon to a mysterious boarding school that teaches young people how to become storybook heroes and villains. The twist is that Sophie is roughly dropped into the School for Evil, despite her long blond hair and earnest dreams of becoming a fairy-tale princess, while the odd and ungainly Agatha is placed among the coquettes in pink pinafores at the School for Good. As the girls navigate love, friendship and the demands of their teachers, Mr. Chainani playfully subverts some fairy-tale conventions about what it means to live happily ever after. </p><p>   In a way, the books are an extended metaphor for the challenges of adolescence, when children are wrenched from all that is familiar and thrust into a world of nascent powers and achingly big feelings. \"I found puberty to be an entirely violent process,\" says Mr. Chainani. \"Everything that was happening, the physical changes, the dopamine changes, the intense attraction to boys, it felt like I had entered a portal into Narnia or something.\" He explains that he started the series with heroes who are 13 or 14 in order to capture that \"scary\" time of life \"when the road to adulthood suddenly opens up, and you can either go towards or away from your true self.\" </p><p>   With hindsight, he reckons that he personally \"failed\" this test as a teenager by shying away from his own destiny. He says his 7th-grade English teacher, Maria Gonzalez -- who is the inspiration for Lady Lesso, the demanding, glamorous and intense dean of the School of Evil, played in the film by Ms. Theron -- helped him see that he was a writer. But he worried that becoming an artist of any kind would invite condemnation by revealing his feelings for boys. \"I knew deep in my heart that writing was the only thing I could ever do, but I went into the closet and decided I was going to go into business,\" he says. </p><p>   Partly to mask his awkwardness, Mr. Chainani threw himself into his studies. In his first year at Harvard, he took a seminar with Maria Tatar, an esteemed scholar of fairy tales who opened his eyes to a world beyond Disney. \"All of my ideas about rebalancing fairy tales came from that class,\" he recalls. </p><p>   Mr. Chainani noticed that while only a fraction of folk tales had female villains, these were often the most indelible stories. \"The men are usually physical brutes who come out with guns blazing, but the women approached evil with ingenuity. They represented what's scariest in a child, an unmaternal mother,\" he observes. His books poke gentle fun at the way female ambition in popular tales is often the preserve of wicked witches and stepmothers, while princesses tend to be passive, pretty and pining for a prince. </p><p>   After years at the top of his class, Mr. Chainani found life outside the classroom disorienting. He began work as a pharmaceuticals consultant and promptly got fired for his apathy; then he was fired twice more from other jobs. \"I basically had a nervous breakdown,\" he says. After some long walks and soul-searching, he decided that he could no longer stifle his creative side, so he enrolled in Columbia's film school. \"Writing a book felt too lonely and scary at that time in my life,\" he explains. \"Film felt like a safe space to explore storytelling collaboratively.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chainani says he graduated Columbia in 2008 \"ready to be the next Spielberg,\" but after several promising projects failed to pan out, he found himself back in New York City with around $250,000 in education debt. \"It was the clearest sign to me that it was time to do something else,\" he says. </p><p>   He got a lucrative job tutoring college-bound students, which he would keep for close to a decade, and began mapping out what would become \"The School for Good and Evil.\" He sent his idea to 17 publishers and got 16 rejections before landing a three-book deal with HarperCollins (which, like The Wall Street Journal, is a division of News Corp). </p><p>   Although the franchise now includes around 180 characters and countless plot twists, he says he doesn't keep notes or outlines, but instead surrenders himself to the work, which he describes as like entering a hypnotic state and letting another freer part of himself take over. \"It almost feels like my unlived youth, the part that I wasn't allowed to show, has now found its life on the page,\" he says. He adds that his editor will sometimes ask nervously where a story is headed: \"I'll say, 'I won't know until I get there.' Then the elves show up at the right time.\" </p><p>   Having just finished his ninth book in 10 years, Mr. Chainani says he is finally ready to let go of this imaginative world and let the \"incredible\" screen adaptation take over. He is also considering a move to St. Louis to be near the man he has been seeing for the last year, a farmer who raises goats; he jokes that he is \"basically going to be a farm husband.\" </p><p>   As Mr. Chainani feels his way into his next project, he says he is eager to find something that will occupy another decade: \"As long as I'm writing, as long as I'm able to sit and surrender, then I'll discover what comes next.\" </p><p></p>",
