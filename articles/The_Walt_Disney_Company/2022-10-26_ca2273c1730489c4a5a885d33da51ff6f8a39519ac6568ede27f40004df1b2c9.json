  "title": "Travel Season Extends Into Autumn --- Hybrid work brings more flexibility to satisfy pent-up vacation demand",
  "text": "<p>Some families who put off vacations during the pandemic say they are now splurging on bigger trips to destinations like Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, and the allure of the strong dollar overseas is bringing more visitors to cities such as London.</p><p>The desire for getaways is fueling bookings for flights and hotels -- as well as keeping prices higher. More than a quarter of American travelers said they expected to take a trip in October, according to a September survey from market-research firm Destination Analysts. And for September through November, airline ticket sales by U.S. travel agencies that specialize in vacations are up 9%, according to Airlines Reporting Corp., which processes tickets for travel agencies.</p><p>\"There's still some unwinding of this pent-up travel demand,\" says Chuck Thackston, managing director of data science and research at Airlines Reporting Corp.</p><p>Stacey MacKenzie and her family plan to drive from their home in the Lewiston, Maine, area to Orlando, Fla., this week for a weeklong vacation at Walt Disney World and Universal Studios. Typically, Ms. MacKenzie, her husband and their three kids -- ages 12, 15 and 17 -- spend time near the ocean in Maine during the summer, but this year, they held off to save up for their first big out-of-state vacation as a family.</p><p>\"I'm one of those people that sees Disney commercials and cries because I want to go so bad,\" the 43-year-old analyst says.</p><p>The family planned their trip for October, even though it means pulling their kids out of school, hoping to find cooler weather and smaller crowds than the summer months, she says.</p><p>The MacKenzies aren't the only travelers destined for Orlando this fall. September hotel demand in the city was 14% higher than 2019, and as of last week, advance hotel bookings for vacation travel in October are 5% ahead of 2019 levels, says Casandra Matej, president and CEO of Visit Orlando.</p><p>While business travel is making a slower comeback, the flexibility of hybrid work schedules is also lending itself to more vacations, according to airline executives.</p><p>Marc Doughty and his wife had a long-distance marriage before the pandemic, with Mr. Doughty outside of Providence, R.I., and his wife in Manhattan. During the pandemic, Rhode Island became their home base, which gave them more disposable income to travel, the 40-year-old IT security engineer says.</p><p>Because they both have remote jobs, they often travel after work on a Wednesday or Thursday. They work remotely at their destination and can begin their weekend Friday night after work, Mr. Doughty says.</p><p>The pair traveled to New York City in mid-September and have also visited friends in New England and Los Angeles by working remotely for a short time.</p><p>\"It's nice to separate the stress of travel from the enjoyment of a nice weekend at a destination,\" he says.</p><p>Airline executives at Delta Air Lines Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. have said that travel demand has been bolstered by flexible and hybrid work schedules, as well as more people combining business trips with leisure, known in the industry as bleisure. September, a typically off-peak travel month, was United's third-strongest month in its history, Scott Kirby, United's chief executive, said in an earnings call last week.</p><p>The strength of leisure travelers helped fuel overall recovery for hotel companies, with September marking the first time the number of rooms sold surpassed the same month in 2019, says Alison Hoyt, senior director of consulting for STR, a hospitality data and analytics company.</p><p>For consumers, that means high hotel prices haven't gone away. Year-to-date average daily hotel rates are up about 22% compared with the same period last year, Ms. Hoyt says.</p><p>The Nonantum Resort in Kennebunkport, Maine, typically sees demand slow down after the federal holiday in mid-October. But the property was sold out through this past weekend, two weeks later than normal, says general manager Tina Hewett-Gordon. Rates are up about 20% compared with last year, but expenses are also up about 20% as the property pays more in employee wages and supplies, she says.</p><p>The seasonal resort plans to stay open an additional week in December because of demand, Ms. Hewett-Gordon says.</p><p>Some U.S. travelers have been taking advantage of the strong dollar and setting their sights on international vacations. Before the pandemic, the One Aldwych hotel in London primarily saw corporate travelers from the U.S., but now it welcomes mainly leisure travelers, says general manager Janine Marshall.</p><p>Some travelers are tacking on days to business trips, but many are on vacation or taking part in family gatherings or belated celebrations, Ms. Marshall says. In response, the hotel made it easier to book family suites and secured 23 such reservations in September and October, up from zero during those months in 2019, she says.</p><p>Other travelers are taking bucket list trips they don't want to put off any longer. Miley Alfaro will travel to New York City this week from her home in Los Angeles. Ms. Alfaro has always wanted to see \"The Phantom of the Opera\" on Broadway. Once she learned the show would close in February, she booked flights and bought a ticket.</p><p>\"I knew that if I missed this opportunity, I would regret it for the rest of my life,\" says the 26-year-old, who works as an attendant at a soccer stadium.</p><p>She plans to travel on weekdays and stay in an Airbnb in New Jersey to save money on the trip, she says. She has also stopped eating out over the past month so she can fully enjoy eating out in New York, including multiple pizza dinners.</p>",
