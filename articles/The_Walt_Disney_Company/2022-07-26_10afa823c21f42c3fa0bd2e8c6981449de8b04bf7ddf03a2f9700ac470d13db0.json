  "text": "<p>   New federal investigations into the deepening hush-money scandal enveloping World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. hastened the retirement of its chief executive, Vince McMahon, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors have launched inquiries into payments made by Mr. McMahon to settle allegations of sexual misconduct, the people said. The media company said Monday that it has received \"regulatory, investigative and enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or demands\" in connection with millions of dollars in hush-money pacts. </p><p>   WWE disclosed the inquiries in a securities filing, which also said that an ongoing internal investigation had uncovered agreements by Mr. McMahon to make payments totaling $14.6 million from 2006 through 2022. WWE said Mr. McMahon \"has or will pay\" all the expenses personally. </p><p>   The payments, first revealed by The Wall Street Journal, should have been recorded in the company's financial statements, WWE's filing said. The company said it expects to revise previous financial statements going back to 2019 to reflect the payments. WWE also said that an internal board investigation \"expects to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of one or more material weaknesses.\" </p><p>   A spokesman for Mr. McMahon and the company previously said that they were cooperating with the internal investigation by the board. A spokesman for the independent directors of the WWE board declined to comment. The SEC didn't  respond to a request for comment. The U.S. attorney's office in Connecticut, where WWE is based, declined to comment. </p><p>   The inquiries from regulators and law enforcement show how the scandal over Mr. McMahon's personal conduct could put the company's business interests at risk. WWE is the biggest pro-wrestling brand in the world, and has lucrative licensing deals with entertainment giants such as Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal. (Fox and The Wall Street Journal share common ownership.) A crucial deal with Hulu, which streams WWE's Monday Night RAW program, is set to expire later this year. Walt Disney Co. has a majority stake in the streaming platform. </p><p>   Mr. McMahon, 76 years old, announced his retirement Friday, as the internal investigation into the payment and allegations of sexual misconduct against him and another WWE executive continued. </p><p>   His retirement took wrestlers, wrestling fans and current and former WWE employees by surprise. In the past, Mr. McMahon told members of the board and WWE executives that he would remain in the job until he could no longer work, according to people familiar with his comments. </p><p>   Shares of WWE rose 8.4%, to $71.81 in trading Monday. Vasily Karasyov, an analyst for Cannonball Research who covers WWE, said investors were responding to the possibility of a sale, now that Mr. McMahon has retired. </p><p>   \"If you have a company that was created or made into what it is now by one leader, and the leader steps aside . . . it pretty much will always have [Wall Street] speculating that strategic options will be explored,\" Mr. Karasyov said. </p><p>   WWE on Monday also forecast revenue of $328 million for the second quarter, up from $266 million a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street expectations for revenue of $311.9 million, according to FactSet. The company said it expects operating income of $70 million for the quarter. </p><p>   With Mr. McMahon's retirement, WWE has named Mr. McMahon's daughter, Stephanie McMahon, and the company's current president, Nick Khan, as co-CEOs. Ms. McMahon will serve as chairwoman. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Will Feuer contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
