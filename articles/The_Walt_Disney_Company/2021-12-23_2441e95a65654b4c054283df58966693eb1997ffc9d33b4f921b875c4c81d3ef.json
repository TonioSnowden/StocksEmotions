  "text": "<p>\n  Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts </p><p>\n  The Met Fifth Avenue, through March 6, 2022 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New York -- 'The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first exhibition about Hollywood dream maker Walt Disney is a landmark event,\" writes the museum's director, Max Hollein, in the foreword to the catalog of \"Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts.\" It is -- and not in a good way. The show, which pairs 18th-century European decorative arts objects with Disney-related materials in an effort to show the influence of one on the other, breaks with the museum's storied past and sets it on the path to an unworthy future. </p><p>\n  Organized by the museum's Wolf Burchard, the show presents 60 objects such as Meissen figures and Sevres porcelain, Boulle clocks, and furniture that will never be confused with anything from Restoration Hardware with 150 production artworks, film clips and other materials linked to creations of Disney Studios such as \"Beauty and the Beast.\" </p><p>\n  There's something else on display, too. Mr. Burchard isn't content with tracing artistic influence. He wants us to see the two bodies of work as essentially the same. He writes in the catalog of \"the many areas of overlap in their sources of inspiration, artistic intuition, rhetoric, humor, craftsmanship, workshop practices, and advances each pushed in design and technology.\" Not only that, he says, but the Rococo craftsmen and Disney animation artists shared an ambition, to engender \"feelings of excitement, awe, and marvel . . . among their respective audiences.\" </p><p>\n  This is like arguing that a Renaissance painting of the Crucifixion and British modern artist Francis Bacon's treatment of that subject inhabit the same universe. It's another example of postmodernism's great leveling project to eradicate all hierarchies, distinctions and standards by establishing a false equivalence between opposites. </p><p>\n  Still, the show does put some truly exquisite objects before visitors that they might otherwise have been unaware of. There's the gilt-bronze candlestick whose swirling forms and sinuous lines look ahead two centuries to the Art Nouveau movement, and the richly upholstered carved-and-gilded sofa that's far too beautiful to even think of sitting on. </p><p>\n  Then there are the porcelains. European craftsmen had just cracked the code that had previously thwarted their efforts to make porcelain as fine as what was being imported from China. The result was an outpouring of works, such as the Meissen figure groups and Sevres Elephant vases on display here, of such imaginative richness, aesthetic sophistication and technical refinement that they have never lost their capacity to astonish. </p><p>\n  There are ways to mount a sources-and-influences show like this, but \"Inspiring Walt Disney\" isn't it. Because those masterpieces don't stand a chance in this exhibition. They are completely upstaged by the Disney machine, by the soundtrack blaring through the galleries, for example, and the continuous-loop clip from \"Beauty and the Beast\" being shown on a 4-by-8-foot screen -- the size of one of the Met's own paintings. </p><p>\n  Most egregious, to draw a connection with Disney's dancing teapots, candelabra and the like, Mr. Burchard has set things like the gilt-bronze candlestick and two porcelain figures on rotating bases. This turns them into the equivalent of a young girl's ballerina box where a small tutued plastic figure pops up and starts pirouetting when the lid is opened. I've never seen a museum so misuse and diminish the works of art entrusted to its care. </p><p>\n  The most dispiriting aspect of this episode is the loss of institutional self-confidence it suggests. Time was when the Met saw itself as an intellectual leader, unafraid to mount shows of unfamiliar, even obscure, subjects simply because they mattered, and trusting that the public would respond. It did. To take one example, the museum's 1988 \"Painting in Renaissance Siena\" can't have been conceived as a \"blockbuster\" exhibition because it was installed in the Lehman Wing, whose galleries aren't scaled to accommodate crowds. Yet word of mouth made it one. Every day I went, large numbers of visitors -- more than I've ever seen in that space before or since -- were there reading the extensive wall texts, then avidly scrutinizing the religious narratives hanging next to them. </p><p>\n  This is why Mr. Hollein's opening sentence is so portentous. Met exhibitions in the past have occasionally engaged with popular culture. But this one does so at an altogether different order of magnitude -- in its choice of subject, the way it is organized and weighted (Disney objects outnumber the rest by more than 2 to 1), and the ideas it advances. With \"Animating Walt Disney,\" the Met has gone all in on the Magic Kingdom. </p><p>\n  As a result, it's hard to escape the conclusion that, either because of the financial havoc wrought by the pandemic or for some other reason, the Met's leadership has decided it can no longer count on that earlier aspirational outlook to drive the visitorship the museum needs. So it will henceforth rely on the spoonful-of-sugar practice, so familiar at other museums, of yoking fine art to popular culture. What's next for the Met, \"Ancient Roman Art and the Costuming of 'Animal House'\"? I can't wait. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Gibson is the Journal's Arts in Review editor. </p><p></p>",
