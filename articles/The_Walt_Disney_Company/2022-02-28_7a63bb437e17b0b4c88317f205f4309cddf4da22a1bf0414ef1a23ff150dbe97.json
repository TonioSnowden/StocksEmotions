  "text": "<p>Recorded-music revenue is at its highest point in more than a decade, but the global Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020 froze the live concert business and the chill persisted through most of last year as well. Industry tracking company Pollstar estimates that the top 100 musical acts sold just 19 million tickets in 2021. That was up 42% from 2020's meager numbers, but was less than half the 56 million tickets sold annually by the top 100 acts on average from 2015 to 2019. The shifting public-health situation, with the Delta and Omicron variants sparking fresh outbreaks in the summer and late fall, respectively, didn't help a business that depends on its ability to pack thousands of screaming fans into some tight places.</p><p>Concerts are a big business; the top 100 acts alone collectively grossed more than $5 billion a year pre-pandemic. Live performances also now count for about 90% of artists' total income, according to Guggenheim Securities analyst Curry Baker.</p><p>Musicians naturally are itching to get back on the road. Pollstar reports confirmed tour plans for 2022 by several acts that have ranked among its top 10 draws in recent years, including Ed Sheeran, Elton John, Coldplay and the Eagles.</p><p>Will the fans be there? Recovery for other forms of in-person entertainment has been mixed. Walt Disney's most recent results showed its theme park revenues almost back to normal in the fourth quarter. But movie theater operator Cinemark Holdings reported fourth-quarter revenue on Friday that was still 15% below the same period in 2019 despite the release of the box-office smash \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" during the latest quarter. Chief Executive Sean Gamble told analysts in a conference call that \"we expect 2022 to be a recovery year.\" Analysts project the company's revenue this year to be about 18% below 2019's level.</p><p>But while movie fans can now wait only a few weeks for their favorite flick to hit a streaming outlet, live music benefits from the scarcity value of having few replacement options. Concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment said in its own fourth-quarter report last week that it has already sold 45 million tickets this year, up 45% from the same period in 2019. Acts such as Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish have sold more than 500,000 tickets each for their tours this year. In the company's earnings call Wednesday, CEO Michael Rapino added that no-show rates—fans who bought tickets but didn't turn out—were back to 2019 levels over the past month.</p><p>Wall Street is cheering already. Live Nation shares have jumped 46% over the past six months—a time in which the S&amp;P 500 has retreated by 2%. Analysts expect the company's revenue this year to exceed 2019's by about 15%. And it may not be a one-time catch-up; Live Nation President Joe Berchtold said there are about 40 tours \"either confirmed or in our pipeline\" for 2023, compared with the five to 10 the company is typically aware of this far out. Another outbreak could certainly cloud that picture, but musicians can be grateful that their fans appear to be a resilient bunch. Live Nation certainly needs them to be.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What live shows are you looking forward to this year?
