  "title": "Smartmatic Sues Newsmax and OANN for Defamation; Voting-machine company alleges the networks aired defamatory reports related to the 2020 presidential election; the networks have defended their coverage",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuits ask for unspecified monetary damages to be determined at trial. Smartmatic earlier this year filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox Corp.'s Fox News seeking $2.7 billion in damages.</p><p>In the new lawsuits, Smartmatic accused Newsmax and One America News Network of defaming the company by publishing false reports that claimed its technology was used to switch votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden.</p><p>Representatives for Newsmax and One America News Network didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Newsmax has defended its coverage and previously said it simply reported on allegations made by well-known public figures, including then-President Trump and his advisers. Newsmax published a clarification in December saying that it found no evidence that Smartmatic used software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.</p><p>In February, One America News Network published a disclaimer saying it didn't adopt or endorse any opinions regarding Smartmatic or other election officials with respect to a video it aired that featured MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and claimed the 2020 presidential election was rigged.</p><p>\"OANN knew voting machines did not switch votes from former President Donald Trump to current President Joe Biden. OANN had every opportunity to provide its audience these facts. It chose to do the opposite,\" said the complaint against One America News Network, which was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"Newsmax had no evidence to support what its anchors had been saying. It had seen no evidence to support what its guests had been saying. Newsmax had spent a month endorsing a conspiracy theory involving Smartmatic and rigging the election,\" said the lawsuit against Newsmax, which was filed in Delaware state court.</p><p>Smartmatic has provided voting systems and services in more than two dozen countries, the company said. But it has a limited footprint in the U.S. Only one county, Los Angeles County, used Smartmatic's technology in the 2020 general election.</p><p>Smartmatic said the accusations have hurt its business prospects and inspired threats against its employees. The company said it was valued in excess of $3 billion before the 2020 election, but now is valued at under $1 billion.</p><p>The suits represent the second and third defamation lawsuits by Smartmatic related to the 2020 election. Smartmatic sued Fox Corp.'s Fox News and several other defendants in February, seeking $2.7 billion in damages for what it alleged were defamatory on-air comments about the company related to the 2020 election.</p><p>Fox moved in February to dismiss Smartmatic's defamation suit, arguing that claims of election fraud by Mr. Trump and his legal team were newsworthy and that the network's coverage of them was protected by the First Amendment. The judge hasn't ruled on the motion to dismiss.</p><p>Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.</p><p>Federal and state officials have said there is no evidence that any voting system changed votes in the November election. Election officials have audited millions of paper ballots, which affirmed that Mr. Biden won the presidential election.</p><p>\"These lawsuits are their best opportunity to set the record straight,\" said J. Erik Connolly, a lawyer representing Smartmatic. Mr. Connolly was one of the lead attorneys for Beef Products Inc. in its 2012 lawsuit against Walt Disney Co.'s ABC News over use of the term \"pink slime\" to describe textured beef products. The lawsuit was settled in 2017.</p><p>Smartmatic isn't alone. Another voting-machine company, Dominion Voting Systems, has filed a series of defamation lawsuits in the wake of the 2020 election, including against Newsmax and OANN.</p><p>Dominion filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News in March. Fox moved to dismiss the suit, saying its coverage of claims about election fraud was newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>More Election News</p><p>Read articles about 2021 results, selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* Glenn Youngkin Wins Virginia Governor Race</p><p>* Minneapolis Rejects Measure to Replace Police</p><p>* Michelle Wu Is First Woman Elected Boston Mayor</p><p>Write to Alexa Corse at alexa.corse@wsj.com</p><p>Smartmatic Sues Newsmax and OANN for Defamation</p>",
