  "title": "California bill would hold tech companies liable for kids' social-media addiction",
  "text": "<p>It would hold companies accountable regardless of whether they deliberately designed their products to be addictive.</p><p>The bill, called the Social Media Platform Duty to Children Act, was introduced Tuesday by State Assembly members Jordan Cunningham, a Republican, and Buffy Wicks, a Democrat. It&#xa0;arrives less than a month after Cunningham and Wicks&#xa0;put forward another bill, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, which would force owners of web products to limit the collection of California children's data, better protect them from other users, simplify convoluted privacy settings and agreements, and curtail addictive interfaces.</p><p>The bills were written to improve children's experiences online from two different angles, according to Cunningham. Last month's bill aims to guide companies' practices, while the new bill is meant to push companies to “bear some of the social costs that they put on all of our children,” he said.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Saudi Arabia considers accepting yuan instead of dollars for Chinese oil sales.</p><p>After Walt Disney, Robert Iger heads to the metaverse.</p>",
