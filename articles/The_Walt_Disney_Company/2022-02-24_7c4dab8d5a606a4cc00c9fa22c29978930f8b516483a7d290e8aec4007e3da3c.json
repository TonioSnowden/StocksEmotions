  "text": "<p>Americans are clamouring to walk through turnstiles, jump on to roller coasters and gawk at dolphins. They are even happy to pay more for the privilege. On Thursday, SeaWorld Entertainment reported 2021 fourth-quarter results that trumped the same quarter in pre-pandemic 2019. </p> <p>Park attendance at the company's dozen facilities climbed 5 per cent to 5mn people. Those visitors were more than willing to empty their wallets once inside the gates. Total revenue per capita jumped 18 per cent, driven by food and merchandise purchases. &#xa0;</p> <p>Theme park attendance has been surprisingly strong at media conglomerates too. Walt Disney and Comcast have long touted their digital streaming services. This is where most investor interest lies. Yet the recent rebound at Disney World and Comcast's Universal Studios created big profits to plough back into their respective money-sucking video units. </p> <p>The best may be still to come. Foreign tourists have yet to return in force to the US. At the same time, companies believe that efficiencies wrung out during the pandemic have lowered structural operating costs. At SeaWorld alone, operating profit nearly doubled relative to the last quarter of 2019.</p> <p>Theme parks may be uniquely positioned to exploit the recovery from Covid-19. They tend to be outdoors or open-air and can hold tens of thousands of visitors a day. </p> <p>As for operating costs, all service businesses are facing labour shortages and higher wages. But Disney noted that its theme park business may have found some permanent efficiencies. Hotel check-ins have now been automated and newly created mobile dining, ordering by app, requires fewer staff. </p> <p>Expect theme park attendance to remain strong throughout 2021 as Americans make up for lost time and international travellers return for holidays. SeaWorld shares are up more than seven times since their bottom in March 2020, making it one of the top reopening bets. Unfortunately, investors arriving at the attraction at this late stage might be stuck at the back of the line.</p><p>Source:  2022 'SeaWorld: theme park results show queues forming for in-person entertainment' FT.com 24 February.
