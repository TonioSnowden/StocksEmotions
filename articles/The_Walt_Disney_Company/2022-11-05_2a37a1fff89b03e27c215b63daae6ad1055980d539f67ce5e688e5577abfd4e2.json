  "title": "U.S. News: Trump Readies 2024 Campaign --- Former president is said to be preparing to announce candidacy by end Of November",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Trump has teased the possibility of another campaign in recent months and had considered an announcement over the summer. But he was dissuaded by advisers who cautioned it could make him a distraction for Republicans in an otherwise favorable political climate. The exact timing is still a subject of debate among his advisers.</p><p>Two years after his loss to President Biden, Mr. Trump remains the GOP's clear leader and he has sought to further influence the party with dozens of endorsements in the midterm elections, some of which have roiled other party leaders. If Republicans perform strongly Tuesday in their bids to control Congress, Mr. Trump may feel especially bullish about his prospects.</p><p>\"I don't think there's any question -- it's his nomination for the asking,\" said Trump pollster John McLaughlin. \"The Republican base has not moved on from Trump. Every day in hindsight he looks better and better among those voters.\"</p><p>Some Republicans have been hoping Mr. Trump, 76 years old, decides against a run. They want to turn the page from his tumultuous personal style that motivated Democrats and turned off many independents and moderate Republicans. Mr. Trump continues to dwell on the 2020 election and is involved in numerous legal entanglements.</p><p>\"The question as to whether or not he is good for the party was already answered in 2018 and 2020,\" said GOP strategist Mike DuHaime, referring to electoral losses the party sustained when Mr. Trump was in office.</p><p>An announcement could also complicate a host of investigations Mr. Trump faces, including the Justice Department's criminal probe into sensitive government documents he stored at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Some Republicans wonder if Mr. Trump's official entry into the race would make prosecutors less likely to pursue charges against him.</p><p>\"Indict a candidate for president? Better have the goods,\" said Republican strategist Scott Reed. \"We are sailing in uncharted waters.\"</p><p>His advisers deny the investigations are a factor in his decision-making, given he has long talked about running, though they give him another point of attack against Mr. Biden. \"They raided Mar-a-Lago, can you believe it?\" Mr. Trump said in Iowa Thursday to boos.</p><p>Mr. Trump has been assembling what could be a campaign team in waiting. Among those working for his recently formed political-action committee, Make America Great Again Inc., are executive director Taylor Budowich, Mr. Trump's communications director; pollster Tony Fabrizio; and strategist Chris LaCivita, who ran a pro-Trump PAC in 2020 funded by the late GOP donor Sheldon Adelson.</p><p>Susie Wiles, who oversaw Mr. Trump's winning Florida campaigns in 2016 and 2020, is also expected to have a top role in any campaign.</p><p>Mr. Trump's aides calculate that an announcement soon would deter other Republicans who have signaled interest, but they don't expect to clear the field. The chief threat is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p><p>While Mr. Trump retains a clear lead in hypothetical 2024 GOP primary polls, the No. 2 in surveys is Mr. DeSantis, who built a national profile battling the Biden administration on Covid-19 policies and corporations such as Walt Disney Co. on cultural issues.</p><p>Some polls have shown GOP loyalty to Mr. Trump has declined since he left office, which is encouraging challengers to make forays into early voting states.</p><p>If Mr. Trump can't have the primary field to himself, his advisers would rather a larger group of Republicans run, feeling it would diffuse support among those candidates while he maintains his core base. Other potential candidates include former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</p><p>Mr. Trump has become convinced he can beat Mr. Biden, aides say, and got more serious about the idea during the current administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in summer 2021. That moment along with missteps on handling Covid-19, high gasoline prices and persistent inflation have weakened Mr. Biden, who turns 80 this month and faces questions in his own party whether he is best suited to run again.</p><p>The president has indicated he will seek another term and thinks he can defeat Mr. Trump again.</p><p>---</p><p>Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.</p><p>---</p><p>Fundraising Has</p><p>Been a Key Focus</p><p>Former President Donald Trump has raised money incessantly since leaving office. His Save America committee had roughly $70 million cash on hand as of October.</p><p>He recently formed a new political-action committee called Make America Great Again Inc. which received $20 million in startup cash from Save America. Much of that has been used on ads for Senate races.</p><p>Mr. Trump could shift more money to MAGA Inc., which faces fewer restrictions and could be used to further his campaign goals.</p>",
