  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Friday's Markets: Dow, S&P 500 Creep to Fresh Records",
  "text": "<p>The trading session was marked by muted moves, with major indexes hugging the flatline during the day. Still, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 inched higher to concurrent records for the fourth consecutive session, something that hasn't happened since October 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Stocks have ground higher in thin summer trading in recent sessions, bolstered by a rapid pace of earnings growth at the biggest American companies, even as the spread of the Delta variant threatens to sap some speed from the economic recovery. Companies including Walt Disney and Tyson Foods posted a big jump in profits this week, and around 86% of S&amp;P 500 constituents that have filed quarterly reports have beaten analysts' expectations.</p><p>\"There's been a lot of reasons for people to remain optimistic,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"I do think the stock market moves higher from here.\"</p><p>Trading has been listless this week, with many traders and money managers on vacation. Just under 3.4 billion shares of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks changed hands Thursday, well below the average daily volume for the year of almost 4.7 billion.</p><p>\"It's a quiet market but the underlying tone still seems fairly positive despite these background concerns,\" said Paul O'Connor, head of multi asset at Janus Henderson Investors.</p><p>In corporate news, Disney shares jumped $1.79, or 1%, to $181.08, after the company posted fiscal third-quarter profit of $918 million compared with a loss of $4.72 billion in the year-earlier period. And a volatile stretch for vaccine makers continued. Moderna shares slipped $1.64, or 0.4%, to $389.78. Pfizer edged up around $1.24, or 2.6%, to $48.48 after the Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots for certain people with weakened immune systems.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes slipped Friday but notched its second week of gains, settling at 1.297%. Yields fall as bond prices rise.</p>",
