  "text": "<p>Lee Berke, a sports-media consultant, says sports broadcasters are in a much better position this time around.</p><p>\"As unnerving as this is, it's not the same this time because there's tools in place to protect people and reduce the impact of the virus,\" he said. \"If the games are made up, there's no harm and no foul.</p><p>TV networks and leagues say they are monitoring the spread of the virus closely and making appropriate adjustments when needed.</p><p>\"We are in regular communication with our league partners, including the NHL, to understand and adapt to the competition and scheduling decisions they make,\" ESPN said in a statement. ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co., has rights to NBA, NHL and NFL games.</p><p>The NBA informed teams this week that it could still juggle the schedule for Christmas, the league's highest-profile day of the regular season, in response to the more than 80 players who are currently sidelined by Covid protocols. Some of the 10 teams featured in marquee games on ESPN and ABC are battling outbreaks and could be missing their biggest stars.</p><p>The NFL has had to postpone three games so far -- one of which was eventually played on Monday night, with the remaining two scheduled to be played on Tuesday night. A person familiar with the league said the NFL doesn't expect the playoffs or the Super Bowl to be delayed at this point.</p><p>The NHL said it expected games to resume on Dec. 27. The Winter Classic, the NHL's annual outdoor game, is still slated to take place on New Year's Day, and will air on TNT.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
