  "text": "<p>Ad-free Disney+ currently costs $7.99 a month, but that will become the rate for the ad-supported Disney+ service, which executives intend to launch Dec. 8. Disney does not currently plan to offer an annual subscription plan for the cheaper Disney+ tier.</p><p>See more: Disney to raise streaming prices while launching ad-supported tier, stock pops as subscriber total tops Netflix</p><p>Disney DIS is also increasing the price of Hulu, which already had tiers with and without advertisements, and those changes will go into effect earlier than the Disney+ price changes. Disney plans to charge $7.99 a month for the ad-supported Hulu tier and $14.99 a month for the premium, ad-free tier, up from $6.99 a month for ad-supported service or $12.99 a month for the ad-free offering. Those changes go into effect Oct. 10.</p><p>Executives at the company previously announced that the monthly rate for ESPN+ would go up to $9.99 from $6.99, with that change to take effect Aug. 23. The ESPN-linked streaming service only offers an ad-supported version.</p><p>Many consumers choose to bundle the Disney streaming services, and prices for some of those offerings will also change. Disney will begin offering a bundle that combines the ad-supported versions of both Disney+ and Hulu for $9.99 a month, and a version that adds ESPN+ to that will cost $12.99 a month.</p><p>Existing subscribers will be eligible for a bundle combining ad-free Disney+, ad-supported Hulu and ESPN+ for a monthly charge of $14.99. The company will continue to offer a bundle of ad-free Disney+, ad-free Hulu and ESPN+ for $19.99 a month.</p><p>Hulu + Live TV pricing will change as well. The company currently charges $69.99 a month for Hulu+ Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+, a package that includes ad-free Disney+ and ad-supported Hulu. Starting in December, that will be the new price of a tier that includes ad-supported Disney+ along with the rest of the mix.</p><p>Additionally, Disney plans to charge $82.99 a month for a premium Hulu + Live TV package that combines ad-free Disney+ and Hulu with ESPN+ and the live offerings. The current monthly price for such a service is $75.99.</p><p>Disney will offer a $74.99 monthly bundle to existing subscribers that brings together ad-free-Disney+ and ad-supported Hulu, along with ESPN+ and the live programming.</p><p>The price hikes come as Disney topped expectations with its latest streaming subscriber numbers, bringing its total count of streaming subscribers —including Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu —higher than that of rival Netflix Inc. NFLX.</p><p>Disney+ and Hulu prices are changing — here's how much your streaming plan will soon cost</p>",
