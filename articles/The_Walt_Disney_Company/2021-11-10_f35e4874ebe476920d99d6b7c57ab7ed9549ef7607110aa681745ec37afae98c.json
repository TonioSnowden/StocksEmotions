  "title": "Disney Reports Slowing Disney+ Subscriber Growth; Company's earnings report follows CEO Bob Chapek's earlier warning about adding fewer new users to Disney+ than analysts expected",
  "text": "<p>\"We continue to manage our [direct-to-consumer] business for the long-term,\" Mr. Chapek said in the company's earnings release Wednesday.</p><p>Disney's shares, down 3.7% year-to-day, fell 4.6% to $166.40 in after-hours trading.</p><p>The company recorded $18.5 billion in sales, a 26% increase from the year-ago quarter, when the pandemic shut down much of the world. Results beat/missed analysts' estimates of $18.8 billion, according to a FactSet poll.</p><p>The company's theme parks and consumer products division had a profit of $640 million for the quarter, swinging from a loss last year. Revenue at the division—which includes its storied Walt Disney World and Disneyland resorts—doubled from a year ago to $5.45 billion.</p><p>Pent-up demand for the parks has caused ticket sales to stay steady, and the division recently introduced new technological features that allow the company to charge visitors for perks.</p><p>Overall, Disney recorded earnings of $159 million, or 9 cents a share, for the three-month period ended Oct. 2, compared with a year-ago loss of $710 million, or 39 cents a share. Adjusted earnings were 37 cents a share in the latest quarter, below analysts' estimates of 52 cents a share.</p><p>When Covid-19 closed movie theaters and Disney theme parks, attention turned to Disney+, then a months-old service that saw its popularity surge amid stay-at-home orders. The streaming service's early success signaled a new chapter for Disney, one focused on direct-to-consumer efforts that allowed investors to value the company on growth, as they would a tech company.</p><p>Mr. Chapek said in September that projected growth from customers in India was below expectations following the delay of Indian Premier League cricket games that air on the service. Competitors like Netflix Inc. have also seen pandemic-level growth slow, as lockdowns ease and consumers find entertainment options outside of the home.</p><p>In general, Mr. Chapek said, investors should expect Disney+ growth to be more sporadic than the steady climb that the service's early months showed. At Netflix, for instance, reports earlier this year of a slowdown in sign-ups were followed by a better-than-expected showing in the company's most recent quarter. The streaming service added 4.4 million subscribers—or about a million more than it had forecast—in the most recent quarter on the strength of new popular shows like \"Squid Game.\"</p><p>In an attempt to boost growth, company recently introduced a discounted offer for Disney+, a promotion that charges $1.99 for the first month, followed by the regular rate of $7.99. A promotional \"Disney+ Day\" is also scheduled for later this week to highlight new programming coming to the service as well as to commemorate its launch in several overseas markets.</p><p>The pandemic delayed production on streaming movies and TV shows at Disney and other services, limiting what viewers can expect to see in their queues for months to come.</p><p>In Disney's case, the company pushed to Disney+ several would-be theatrical releases, such as \"Hamilton\" and \"Soul,\" to keep programming fresh. Recent hit shows like \"WandaVision\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" both produced by Disney's Marvel Studios, have kept viewers hooked but wrapped up their seasons earlier this year.</p><p>Analysts heading into the earnings on Wednesday didn't appear flummoxed by the potential slowdown. \"We estimate that subscriber growth can rebound in the December quarter and beyond,\" David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones, wrote in a report.</p><p>Heard on the Street</p><p>* Movie Theaters Dodge Marvel's Bullet</p><p>The fourth quarter was buoyed by the strong box-office performance of Disney's Labor Day release, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" as well as three months of reopened theme parks in the U.S.</p><p>After the strong performance of \"Shang-Chi\" in theaters, Disney announced that the rest of its 2021 movie slate would premiere on the big screen, rather than exclusively on Disney+ or through a hybrid model. The company's most recent movie, \"The Eternals,\" topped the box office this past weekend, giving Disney three of the four highest-grossing debuts since the pandemic began.</p><p>Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com and Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Reports Slowing Disney+ Subscriber Growth</p>",
