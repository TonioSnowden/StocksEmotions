  "title": "Three Things Marketers Should Know About Netflix's Possible Foray into Ads; The arrival of a major new ad-seller wouldn't immediately create a buyer's market, but it could yield creative new approaches",
  "text": "<p>Any ad-backed tier likely won't land until 2024, some analysts expect, and in the meantime, the company will have to answer a lot of questions on how it would work.</p><p>Netflix Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings said the company is likely to outsource the necessary ad-technology functions, saying on an earnings call that it would open the door to \"have other people do all of the fancy ad-matching and integrate all the data about people.\"</p><p>Here are three things marketers should know about what Netflix's change could mean for them.</p><p>It won't be a flood</p><p>Some observers see Netflix as slowly wading into the ad-supported market, likely starting off with a limited amount of inventory, or available slots for advertising to be sold. And it would gradually ramp up from there.</p><p>\"I don't think this is something that floods the market with all this inventory,\" said Andre Swanston, a senior vice president for the media and entertainment vertical at TransUnion, a credit-reporting firm that also offers identity solutions and tools to measure marketing effectiveness.</p><p>That means Netflix isn't likely to suddenly turn streaming-TV advertising into more of a buyer's market.</p><p>\"The amount of inventory that's available across connected TV is exponentially higher than it was just a few years ago. And it hasn't had this huge depressing value on CPMs,\" he said, using the industry term for the cost of a thousand consumer impressions.</p><p>Given the high expected demand and what could start off as a small amount of inventory, however, Netflix will likely open with a high price point for advertisers, said David Campanelli, executive vice president and chief investment officer at media buyer Horizon Media. That is what happened at the debuts of both HBO Max, now part of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., and Comcast Corp.'s Peacock, he noted. But rates typically fall as the services grow their ad inventory.</p><p>Data will be a key battlefield</p><p>Netflix may have a lot of data, but out of the gate it won't be able to compete with a company such as Amazon.com Inc. when it comes to showing marketers what their ads achieved, Mr. Swanston said. Amazon offers streaming advertising in venues such as its IMDb TV, a free service soon to be rebranded as Amazon Freevee, and its Fire streaming television platform.</p><p>\"Amazon knows if [marketers] advertise for something and [consumers] then come and buy the item,\" he said of the e-commerce titan's ability to track consumer responses. \"Netflix won't know that.\"</p><p>Marketers stand to gain, though, if Netflix tries to close that gap.</p><p>\"The good news is that there's enough vendors of data and identity and attribution and capabilities where they can pretty much just hire their way into having a robust platform pretty quickly to be on the level of other people,\" Mr. Swanston said.</p><p>Netflix will have to grapple with new kinds of considerations about data if advertising enters the picture.</p><p>\"One of Netflix's strengths has been the healthy amount of data at their fingertips because of what consumers have opted in with,\" said Denise Ocasio, executive director and U.S. investment lead at Mindshare, an agency owned by WPP PLC's GroupM. \"But now that they're moving into ad-supported models, that changes things from a privacy and regulation standpoint.\"</p><p>The company may need to ask consumers to opt in again to share that data with advertisers, and it isn't clear how consumers would answer, she said.</p><p>Fresh eyes could bring new approaches</p><p>Though Netflix has the reputation of being a first mover, it would be a latecomer to the game of selling ads.</p><p>But that might be a benefit. Its delay will allow it to see what has worked at the competition and what hasn't, Mr. Swanston said.</p><p>One possible option could be a foray into TV-based commerce, which competitors are trying out. Netflix, like other subscription services, helpfully already has members' credit cards on file.</p><p>\"If you'd have a commercial for a consumer-packaged good running right in between 'Orange Is the New Black' or some old show that somebody's watching, why not allow somebody to just press the button and buy that packaged good right there and deliver it to their house?\" Mr. Swanston said.</p><p>Other streaming services have been trying to entice advertisers with ad formats that break the mold of traditional 30-second commercials. Walt Disney Co.-controlled Hulu and Peacock have tried \"pause ads,\" which generate a static ad whenever a viewer presses pause, for example, and \"binge ads,\" which get a viewer an ad-free episode of a show after watching several in a row with ads.</p><p>\"The hope of many advertisers is that Netflix allows for both sophisticated data and ad offerings, but also for creative flexibility and the premium experience Netflix is known for,\" said Nick Drabicky, a senior vice president and general manager of client services at January Digital, a strategic consulting and digital media firm.</p><p>\"In many cases, brands are somewhat stifled by existing ad formats and rigid ad products that are both cumbersome for brands, but also consumers,\" he said. \"The hope is to make these feel as native as possible, and offer unique experiences that enrich the audience experience.\"</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>Three Things Marketers Should Know About Netflix's Possible Foray into Ads</p>",
