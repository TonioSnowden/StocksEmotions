  "text": "<p>With more than 200 theatrical productions under his belt, Broadway (and occasionally off-off-off-off Broadway) director Oliver Putnam (Martin Short) knows what makes a magical show. In theory, anyway. His blockbuster <em>Splash!</em> ended up maiming 12 mermen due to faulty stage hydraulics; the first night review was headlined “Splat!” But if you put together a dream cast, construct a topical premise and pick just the right setting, you may have yourself a winner.&#xa0;</p> <p>The shotgun death of a young neighbour, Tim Kono, barely disturbs the sangfroid of the city-hardened residents of the Arconia, an upscale Manhattan apartment block. The stroppy kid had generated, and fired off, multiple complaints about smoking, pets and other irritants (“Tim was the reason we couldn't use our fireplaces?”) When the problematic death is deemed suicide, three residents who previously barely smiled at each other in the elevator decide to investigate further.&#xa0;</p> <p>Steve Martin plays Charles, a washed-up actor once famous for playing a TV detective. Casting Selena Gomez as Mabel must be an attempt to attract the younger demographic. Rabid fans of a true-crime podcast, the trio realise they have all the makings of an internet sensation right on the doorstep. Oliver can direct (boy, can he direct!), Charles will provide the gritty, yet sonorous narration, and Mabel has the unlovely job of pointing out how old and out of touch the others are.&#xa0;</p> <p>On the surface, Arconia life is luxe and loaded but Oliver hasn't had a hit for years and is eight months behind on his building fees, while Mabel is only pretending to live there while she refurbishes her aunt's flat. She also has her own secret reason for suspecting foul play, linked to another peculiar death years previously. Charles, meanwhile, is a friendless bundle of neuroses apt to spout old lines of TV dialogue in lieu of genuine conversation. “I can't tell if you're acting or not,” says Mabel, an observation that could equally be applied to Gomez's devitalised performance, which rarely rises above the monotonous and po-faced. In terms of youthful energy, Short is streets ahead.&#xa0;</p> <p>As well as a series of lovely living arrangements, the apartment block provides the expected cast of eccentrics: there's building rep Bunny, her floral frocks clashing with her foul mouth; Howard the intense cat fancier; and Nathan Lane as Oliver's unwilling millionaire backer. Also Sting. The mandatory fantasy sequences include Oliver reviewing suspects as though auditioning chorines, Mabel's sketches coming to brief life, and Tim's sardonic postmortem appearance with gunshot residue over his face. But above all it's the Short-Martin show. Old white guys may be, in Mabel's harsh words, “only afraid of colon cancer and societal change”, but they're damn funny with it.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Disney Plus from August 31</em></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2021 'Steve Martin and Martin Short bring the laughs in Disney Plus's Only Murders in the Building' FT.com 27 August.
