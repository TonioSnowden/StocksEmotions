  "text": "<p>In the past, box office film revenues provided a clear picture of what a star, the agents, studios and theaters should earn after a project made its debut. Now, in the age of streaming, data is more scarce and streaming services are less inclined to offer up information and data, he said.</p><p>\"It's a challenge, assigning a dollar value to the equation that is that which causes someone to subscribe in the first place, maintain subscription or spend more time on the platform,\" Mr. Lovett said. \"Those are complicated things to be precise about.\"</p><p>Mr. Lovett declined to comment on a lawsuit that CAA client Scarlett Johansson filed against Disney over her pay for the Marvel film \"Black Widow.\" Ms. Johansson said the simultaneous release of the film on the Disney+ streaming service and in theaters violated her contract. The two have since settled their dispute for an undisclosed amount.</p><p>\"I think our clients want us to fight for them,\" he said. \"I think our clients want us to make certain that they're protected.\"</p><p>Mr. Lovett said that the firm has a division devoted to collecting and evaluating data on how films and shows perform around the world and a client's impact on audience, from all sources, \"to fuel our understanding of deal-making.\" He said he hopes studios agree to share more data.</p><p>When asked about the recent controversy over comedian Dave Chappelle's recent Netflix special, Mr. Lovett said his firm supports freedom of expression. \"We fundamentally as agents are in support of voices and human beings expressing themselves, creative people telling stories, expressing points of views through stories and sharing their ideas,\" he said.</p><p>\"But we also understand the power of those voices, and voices can inspire, they can shift thinking, they can move audiences, and so we're very aware of that power, and it's awfully nice when it's used for good,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Katherine Sayre at katherine.sayre@wsj.com</p><p>Creative Artists Agency Co-Chairman Richard Lovett Says Company Mines Streaming Data for Movie Deals</p>",
