  "title": "Disney Streaming Growth Slows",
  "text": "<p>Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said the company was managing its direct-to-consumer business \"for the long term, not quarter to quarter.\" The service is still on track to reach previous guidance of between 230 million and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024, he said.</p><p>Disney's shares, down 3.7% year to date, fell 4.5% to $166.65 in after-hours trading.</p><p>While Disney's streaming service suffered, Disney's parks posted a surge in year-over-year revenue as attractions reopened and Covid-19 vaccinations proliferated, reflecting a shift in consumer habits over the past several months as the global economy recovers from the pandemic.</p><p>Lockdown orders accelerated Hollywood's pivot toward direct-to-consumer options -- and Wall Street embraced the shift -- but more than a year of pent-up demand for in-person experiences forces Disney and other media companies to straddle old revenue streams with the new.</p><p>Across Disney's balance sheet, a world eager to return to pre-pandemic normalcy can be seen. Theme-park revenue was up 99%. Growth in the company's media division came in part because of advertising revenue attached to the return of live sports, the company said. Box-office grosses in the quarter came from four new movies, including \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" whereas the previous year's quarter had included only one.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Chapek signaled that the company's physical and digital worlds are blurring together. Disney parks visitors have been encouraged to download apps and tools that create an itinerary for the day, order food and purchase perks, and the company is distributing movies and TV shows across screens large and small.</p><p>\"Our efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse,\" he said.</p><p>Still, all eyes will be on Disney's streaming slowdown, which Mr. Chapek had warned in September would disappoint investors.</p><p>Several culprits contributed to the relatively flat growth. Customers in India didn't sign up as expected following the delay of Indian Premier League cricket games that were to air on the service. Distribution in parts of Latin America was complicated by rollout issues. Several hot shows on the service, such as \"WandaVision\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" wrapped up their first seasons earlier this year.</p><p>Competitors like Netflix Inc. have also seen pandemic-level growth slow as lockdowns ease and consumers find entertainment options outside of the home.</p><p>At Netflix, reports earlier this year of a slowdown in sign-ups were followed by a better-than-expected showing in its most recent quarter. The streaming service added 4.4 million subscribers -- or about a million more than it had forecast -- on the strength of new popular shows like \"Squid Game.\"</p><p>Disney needs more hits itself, and coronavirus-related production delays continue to wreak havoc on its release schedule. Disney might not see its desired cadence of programming flowing to Disney+ until next year's fourth quarter, according to Disney finance chief Christine McCarthy, who added that she expects that will help subscriber growth to ramp back up in the latter half of 2022.</p><p>\"Finally the dam will break\" on regular new movies and shows, Mr. Chapek said.</p><p>Some analysts have questioned whether Disney should expand into more adult-oriented programming to draw in new subscribers. Mr. Chapek said the executive team is targeting different demographics but is focused on gaining ground among preschoolers.</p><p>To boost growth, Disney recently introduced a discounted offer for Disney+, a promotion that charges $1.99 for the first month, followed by the regular rate of $7.99. A promotional \"Disney+ Day\" is also scheduled for later this week to highlight new programming coming to the service as well as to commemorate its launch in several overseas markets that are key to hitting its forecast figures.</p>",
