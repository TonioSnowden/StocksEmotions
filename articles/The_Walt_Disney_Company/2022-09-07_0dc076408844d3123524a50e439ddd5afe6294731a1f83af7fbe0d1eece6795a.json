  "text": "<p>Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia have threatened legal action against streaming group Netflix if it continues to broadcast shows they deem un-Islamic. </p> <p>The statement from a Saudi-led committee of the Gulf Cooperation Council follows a campaign in local media accusing the leading streaming content provider in the region of promoting “homosexuality”.</p> <p>The statement did not say which shows were problematic but said that they ran counter to Islam and the law in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/places/Gulf_States\">Gulf countries</a>, and that they included content for children. </p> <p>“The relevant authorities will monitor the platform's compliance with these directives, and will take the necessary legal measures if the content continues to broadcast,” the statement said. </p> <p>Homosexuality is banned in most Arab countries and is widely viewed by their populations as taboo. Authorities in several nations periodically crack down on what they consider LGBT+ behaviour or culture, often after media campaigns. </p> <p>Egypt, the most populous Arab country, followed suit on Wednesday and announced it would start regulating and licensing streaming platforms such as Netflix and Disney Plus to ensure they “adhere to the norms and values of the country”, a statement by the supreme council for media regulation said.</p> <p>An official Saudi television channel had aired a report on Tuesday calling on the government to act against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/2fa688f8-97f0-4596-a705-822b4a5f9d6f\">Netflix</a>. “Pay to subscribe to Netflix, and in return your child will watch scenes such as this that violate morality, yes scenes that promote homosexuality among children,” a voiceover says, before showing a blurred image of two female cartoon characters kissing. </p> <p>The scene was taken from Netflix's <em>Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous</em> animated show. The report separately referred to <em>Cuties</em>, a French film about a Muslim girl who joins a dance group and “arouses paedophiles”. </p> <p>Netflix was forced to apologise in 2020 over promotional material for <em>Cuties</em> after a petition accused the channel of sexualising adolescents. </p> <p>Netflix shares collapsed early this year after the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08ddccfd-ee0d-4aa9-a913-89f07ccc9b8a\">reported losing subscribers</a>. The shares have recovered on third-quarter earnings and growth in subscriptions, although they are still well below last year's prices. The group has retained its leading position in the Middle East, where it faces competition from regional streaming groups such as Shahid and Starz Play. </p> <p>It was not immediately clear what legal measures the Gulf countries could take against Netflix, or how the company intended to react. The governments already block access to some media companies and sexually explicit content. </p> <p>A Netflix spokesperson was not available immediately for comment. A spokesperson for the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media, which had issued the statement, did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>The streaming service has taken down or restricted content in the past at the request of governments, including an episode of a comedy show to which Riyadh objected. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia confiscated from stores rainbow-coloured toys and clothes it said promoted homosexuality. In June, the United Arab Emirates forced Amazon to restrict sales and search results relating to LGBT+ issues, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The crackdown came amid unease among conservative Saudis over social reforms in the once ultra-conservative kingdom that have included the introduction of mixed audiences at concerts and cinemas. </p> <p>In the socially liberal and largely expatriate-populated UAE, authorities have had a pushback from some Emiratis on social issues. A rumoured potential decriminalisation of homosexuality prompted a backlash from many citizens. Social media users have also criticised foreign embassies for raising the rainbow flag during Pride week.</p> <p>In Egypt, authorities have regularly arrested people accused of homosexuality, including a round-up of concert goers in 2017 after they raised rainbow flags at a show. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Alex Barker in London and Simeon Kerr in Dubai</em></p><p>Source: Samer Al-Atrush in Dubai 2022 'Gulf states warn Netflix of legal action over ‘un-Islamic' content' FT.com 7 September.
