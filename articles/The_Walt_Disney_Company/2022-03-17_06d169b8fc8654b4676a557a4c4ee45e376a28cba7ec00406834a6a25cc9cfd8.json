  "text": "<p>   Regarding your editorial \"Does the 'Don't Say Gay' Bill Say That?\" (March 12): We live in the golden age of unapologetic hypocrisy: Mask mandators shirk masks, environmental champions fly in private planes and companies like Disney trumpet progressive policies at home while kowtowing to China, where \"Don't Say Anything, or Else\" is the policy. This is what corporate \"virtue\" looks like these days. </p><p>   Thomas M. Doran </p><p>   Plymouth, Mich. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Has anyone identified school districts in Florida or anywhere else where children under 8 are being taught about human sexuality? This is not a cultural issue. It is a fantasy. Yes, little children will ask questions about the composition of families, and teachers will struggle to answer these questions. But let's not catapult innocent discussion into a national debate. </p><p>   Mark Ashton </p><p>   Philadelphia </p><p>   --- </p><p>   It's weird that the left and its media allies are so upset about a law that prohibits teachers from discussing their views about sexual morality with young children when, at the same time, no teacher in any public-school classroom in our country can discuss his or her religious values with students. There may be no such thing as a \"Don't Say Gay\" law, but \"Don't Say God\" laws are everywhere. </p><p>   Dennis Canfield </p><p>   Chicago </p><p></p>",
