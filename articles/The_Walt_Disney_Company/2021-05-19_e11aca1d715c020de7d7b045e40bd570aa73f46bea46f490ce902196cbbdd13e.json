  "text": "<p>It is never a good omen when the back-story to a film is itself a juicy tale of misadventure. So it proves with <em>The Woman in the Window</em>, a sheeny thriller with what we might call a troubled history. The 2018 source novel was a bestselling sensation. The film rights sold in a frenzy, a star attached in Amy Adams. Then writer AJ Finn (real name Dan Mallory) himself became a cause célèbre — subject of a brutal magazine exposé involving accusations of plagiarism and imposture. That story is itself to become a major TV series; Mallory will be played by Jake Gyllenhaal. </p> <p>For the movie, the indignity of being made a supporting feature was only the start. Disney, having acquired the film during its takeover of Fox, test-screened it then promptly sold it to Netflix. The streaming giant in turn has not been keen to involve critics in pre-publicity. You may be curious to know how bad it could be. </p> <p>Be curious no more. As we collapse into our sofas, Adams does the same in the role of Anna Fox, a New York child psychologist whose nights are spent in the company of old movies — first and most gracelessly <em>Rear Window</em>. (Will you get your elbow out of my ribs?) We learn that she is an agoraphobic, confined to a vast Harlem brownstone. With time on her hands and Hitchcock on screen, she observes a new family move into the house opposite: a sweet teenage son, an affable blonde mother, a coolly patrician father. And then she hears a scream. And then she sees a knife.</p> <p>Director Joe Wright (<em>Atonement</em>, <em>Darkest Hour</em>, usually a high-end operator) has assembled a stellar cast. None can save the day. The film is too dopey for that. Julianne Moore trills as a late-night visitor; Bryan Tyree Hamilton makes a nicely downbeat cop; Gary Oldman is not given enough to do, although he surely makes the most of it. Jennifer Jason Leigh is underused as well, but since when wasn't she? Adams is at least half plausible as a woman who comes to believe all parties are out to destroy her. Sadly she might be on to something with Wright, over-directing in panic. It's as if he can feel the movie deflating but can't find where the puncture is. </p> <p>God knows, reviewing films is easier than making them but the problems are no mystery. One is tone. So essentially ludicrous as to border on camp, everything in sight is still given a grand, awards-seasony glow. The movie looks lovely. But that just makes the whole thing feel sillier. A bigger snag yet is just how thin the plot is. Twists and shocks are promised, banality delivered. Then again, I can't wait for <em>The Dan Mallory Story</em>. </p> <p>★★☆☆☆</p> <p><em>On Netflix now</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'The Woman in the Window — nicely polished but thinly drawn' FT.com 19 May.
