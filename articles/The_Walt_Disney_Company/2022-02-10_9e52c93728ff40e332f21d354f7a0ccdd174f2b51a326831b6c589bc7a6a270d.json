  "text": "<p>(Sundance Now, AMC+)</p><p>Episodes of \"State of the Union\" are made up of little more than 10-minute conversations between a couple before their weekly marriage counseling sessions. Over the course of a 10-episode season, Nick Hornby says the short form allows him to take a long view of a relationship, not just the spark of the beginning or the thud at the end that is typically tackled on screen.</p><p>\"It's not always an event that ends a marriage,\" says Mr. Hornby, writer and creator of the dramedy. \"It's things that get twisted out of shape over a period of many years.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What will you be watching over Valentine's Day weekend and what would you recommend? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The first season—starring Rosamund Pike and Chris O'Dowd as a couple who meet up in a pub—is streaming on both Sundance Now and AMC+. On Monday, Valentine's Day, the first episode of season two premieres on the SundanceTV cable network and all 10 of its episodes are being made available on those streaming services.</p><p>In the new season, Ellen (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband, Scott (Brendan Gleeson), meet at a Connecticut coffee shop called Mouthfeel. In each episode, they discuss the previous and coming sessions, revisit the mile markers in the long life they have had together and discuss where their paths diverged. They also do a bit of sparring—both with each other and a barista played by Esco Jouléy.</p><p>\"The beauty of this writing is I actually feel that there will be men who will see themselves in me and I think there will be women who see themselves [in Scott],\" Ms. Clarkson says. \"I don't think these characters and the troubles they've had and their foibles are gender specific.\"</p><p>New Release: 'The Sky Is Everywhere'</p><p>(Apple TV+)</p><p>The new film \"The Sky Is Everywhere\" is a love story about the different ways family and friends grieve following the sudden death of a young woman named Bailey—particularly Lennie (Grace Kaufman), her sister. Since their mother died when they were young, the girls were inseparable, raised by their grandmother (Cherry Jones) and uncle (Jason Segel) in a picturesque home in the Northern California woods. Bailey's death leaves her teenage sister adrift. For a time, she finds comfort in the arms of Bailey's grieving boyfriend (Pico Alexander). But the situation is complicated by the arrival of a new boy in town (Jacques Colimon).</p><p>\"The Sky Is Everywhere\" is based on the novel by Jandy Nelson, who also wrote the screenplay. In the book, Ms. Nelson writes that \"grief and love are conjoined, you don't get one without the other.\" In this way, she says, she wanted there to be a euphoric underpinning to the book and movie. Yes, it is the story of grief, but grief as \"a measure of this amazing love that was lost,\" she says. \"To really explore that, you are also exploring the gift of life. I think that they're kind of one in the same.\"</p><p>\"The Sky Is Everywhere\" begins showing in select theaters and streaming on Apple TV+ on Friday.</p><p>An Expert Recommends: 'Feel Good,' 'The Rescue'</p><p>(Netflix, Disney+)</p><p>Ellen Rapoport is the creator of \"Minx,\" the HBO Max comedy about an erotic magazine for women in the 1970s that premieres March 17. Here, she provides two recommendations for Valentine's Day viewing. Edited from an interview.</p><p>\"There's a show on Netflix called 'Feel Good' that is my favorite type of show: It's absurd, but at the same time grounded and real and emotional, and just hilarious. It's a semi-autobiographical series about a comedian in the U.K. named Mae Martin, a recovering cocaine addict who begins a relationship with a woman who has never dated women before. You root for these two people to be together, even though they're just incredibly damaged and kind of bottomless pits of need who can't get out of their own way. So it is a feel-good show, but they're such messes that it's not this idealized kind of romance. It's a 30-minute show and the seasons [there are two] are only six episodes long. It's a great amount of time for a show like this, because it breezes by. You could watch an entire season on Valentine's Day.</p><p>\"If you are traumatized by Valentine's Day or you're just not a Valentine's Day enthusiast, 'The Rescue' (Disney+) is so absorbing and so riveting that you will forget it's Valentine's Day. It's a documentary about the effort to rescue a Thai boys soccer team and their coach in a flooded cave system. It's the craziest story.\"</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>— Love Stories for Valentine's Day: A pop star played by Jennifer Lopez plucks Owen Wilson out of the audience for an onstage wedding in \"Marry Me.\" The rom-com is in theaters and on Peacock starting Friday. In \"Book of Love,\" now streaming on Prime Video, an author's novel becomes a surprise hit in Mexico after the Spanish-language translator makes the story a lot steamier. \"The In Between,\" a supernatural love story about a teenager who believes her boyfriend is trying to contact her after he dies in a car accident, begins streaming Friday on Paramount+.</p><p>— Bingeing for Valentine's: All nine episodes of Shonda Rhimes's \"Inventing Anna,\" begin streaming Friday on Netflix. The series is inspired by a New York Magazine article that detailed how a young woman conned her way into New York society.</p><p>— Super Streaming: Yes, the Super Bowl takes place Sunday. You can stream it on Peacock or tune in on NBC. The game begins at 6 p.m. ET.</p><p>What to Watch: Nine Movies and Shows to Stream Valentine's Day Weekend</p>",
