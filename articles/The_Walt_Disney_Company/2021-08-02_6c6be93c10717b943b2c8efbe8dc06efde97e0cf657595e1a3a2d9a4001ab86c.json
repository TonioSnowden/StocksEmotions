  "text": "<p>Child stars in the US are invariably hothoused for success, showbiz being one of the few areas of employment in which child labour remains permissible. Billie Eilish used to be a “moppet” herself, in the lingo of Hollywood trade magazine Variety. But the Californian made for an atypical pop moppet.&#xa0;</p> <p>She was talent-spotted at an early age, signing to a subsidiary of a major record label in 2016 when she was 14. However, Eilish hadn't been nurtured in a Disney entertainment factory like Britney Spears. She grew up idolising Justin Bieber, but unlike him she had no Scooter Braun-style impresario promoting her. Instead she made songs with her brother Finneas O'Connell in their family house, where both were educated as well.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Happier Than Ever</em>&#xa0;finds this homeschooled original installed among the biggest names in the charts, rubbing shoulders with Bieber and Ariana Grande. It's the follow-up to her debut&#xa0;<em>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</em>, which came out in 2019 when she was 17. A huge hit, generating billions of streams and a clutch of top 10 singles, it led to her being labelled “the voice of Generation Z” — a generic title that doesn't do the singularity of her actual voice justice.&#xa0;</p> <p>Eilish has an intriguingly assertive way of singing, at once quiet and loud, withdrawn and extrovert. Her whispery style has deep roots, almost a century old. So-called “whisper singers” first emerged in the 1920s with advances in recording technology. But Eilish has stamped her own persona on it.&#xa0;</p> <p>Aided by the acute sense of space and depth in her brother's production — he also plays almost all the instruments — she brings an imaginatively appealing sense of complication to her songs, rare in mainstream pop. The status of her whispering is unclear. Is it a private form of communication, a mark of intimacy? Or is it a secret sign of egotism, a passive-aggressive insistence that the listener concentrate completely on her whispered words?</p> <p><em>Happier Than Ever</em> opens with “Getting Older”, whose title carries a degree of irony — Eilish is only 19 — but is also true. “I've had some trauma, did things I didn't want to/ Was too afraid to tell you, but now I think it's time,” she whispers. A pulsing synthesiser tone dominates the musical action. Shadowy melodies and backing vocals are subtly buried in the mix, enticing us to dig deeper.</p> <p>Celebrity culture is a recurrent theme, the claustrophobic trappings of fame. The devil, infamous possessor of the best tunes, turns up on one of the album's best tunes, “NDA”. He takes the form of “a stalker walking up and down the street/ Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet.” In “Not My Responsibility”, Eilish recites a spoken word critique of the misogynist body-shaming that she has faced in the public eye. “I feel you watching, always,” she says. Her whispery tone draws us into her confidence — only for us to discover a plea for privacy.</p> <p>A destructive relationship is the album's other main topic. These two narratives intersect. “Leave me alone,” she cries at the end of the title track, abandoning her signature whisper in a storm of guitars and drums. The message is intended for a malign ex-lover, but equally applies to body-shamers and stalkers.</p> <p><em>Happier Than Ever</em>&#xa0;is thoughtfully constructed. It builds on the success of Eilish's debut. But it also suffers from a side effect of her success. At 16 tracks, it would benefit from the kind of trimming that superstars are able to sidestep.&#xa0;</p> <p>The beat-driven songs stand out: they are catchy, dark and witty, with hints of EDM and hip-hop but no settled basis in genre. The slower numbers are less impactful. O'Connell's ear for texture is missing from the simple coffee-shop strum of “Your Power”, while Eilish swaps her enigmatically poised whisper for the conventional tones of a crooner on “Billie Bossa Nova”. At such moments, she ceases to stand out from her hothoused peers.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>‘</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B093TC5S2X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B093TC5S2X\"><em>Happier Than Ever</em></a><em>' is released by Darkroom and&#xa0;Interscope Records</em></p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2021 'Happier Than Ever — Billie Eilish is back with a catchy second album' FT.com 2 August.
