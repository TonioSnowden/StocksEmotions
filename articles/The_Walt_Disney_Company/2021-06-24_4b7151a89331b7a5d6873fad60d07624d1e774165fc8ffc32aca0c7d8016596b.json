  "title": "Technology:  Viacom Picks MTV's  Giles for Streaming Post  ----  By Kimberly Chin",
  "text": "<p>   ViacomCBS Inc. said it tapped MTV executive Tanya Giles as chief programming officer for streaming, part of a broader reorganization as the media company looks to shore up content for its Paramount+ and Pluto TV services. </p><p>   Ms. Giles, who currently serves as the general manager at the MTV Entertainment Group, will centralize programming decisions for the streaming services globally. Other top content executives will oversee portions of Paramount+ programming relevant to their areas of specialty, from music to reality TV. </p><p>   Several big media companies, including Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, Walt Disney Co. and AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia, have reorganized their ranks to give priority to streaming, which has rapidly become the core business priority across the industry. Most companies want to have a top executive who ensures streaming service will get a healthy share of the top TV and movie programming under development. </p><p>   ViacomCBS rolled out its subscription Paramount+ service in the U.S. in March, and competes in a crowded field with incumbents like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. and newcomers such as Disney+. </p><p>   Under the company's reorganization plan, CBS Chief Executive Officer and President George Cheeks will also assume the role of chief content officer of news and sports at Paramount+. Meanwhile, Paramount Pictures Chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos will serve as the content head of movies on the platform. </p><p>    Bruce Gillmer, who runs ViacomCBS's music, music talent, programming and events, will also take on the role of chief content officer of music at Paramount+, the company said. MTV Entertainment Group President Chris McCarthy will shepherd unscripted entertainment and adult animation content for Paramount+. </p><p>   Showtime Networks' chairman and CEO, David Nevins, will build Scripted Originals content for Paramount+ while Nicole Clemens, president of Paramount Television Studios, will be in charge of the platform's Original Scripted Series. </p><p>    Brian Robbins, who heads ViacomCBS's kids and family entertainment unit, will focus on such content at Paramount+, the company said. </p><p>   \"The moves we are making today will accelerate that mission by putting ViacomCBS's most powerful assets -- world-class content, iconic brands, global infrastructure and expertise, and the best talent in the business today -- behind our platforms as we pursue the global opportunity in streaming,\" President and CEO Bob Bakish said in prepared remarks Wednesday. </p><p></p>",
