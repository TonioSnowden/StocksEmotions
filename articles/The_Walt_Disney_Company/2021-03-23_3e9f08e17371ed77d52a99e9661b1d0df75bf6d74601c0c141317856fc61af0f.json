  "text": "<p>\"I never thought I would be standing in a food line for hours,\" said James Cox, a 50-year-old porter, who used to earn $27 an hour wrangling passengers and their luggage. \"Just the degradation of it. You say to yourself, 'Wow, I am really at this point.' \"</p><p>Like the rest of the maritime tourism industry, Port Canaveral was mothballed at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. One year on, as other parts of the economy blink back to life, the U.S. cruise industry is waiting anxiously for Washington's go-ahead to sail again -- and worried that a second summer season is about to be lost.</p><p>Other countries including Singapore, Italy and the U.K. have authorized cruises or set a clear target date for them to set sail. Almost 400,000 passengers have sailed since some countries first began allowing cruises in July 2020, according to the industry's trade group.</p><p>But to get started in the U.S., the cruise industry needs direction from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The CDC lifted its no-sail order in October and replaced it with a conditional set of rules; industry officials said the 40 pages of rules are either indecipherable or impractical, such as a measure requiring cruise lines to conduct \"simulated voyages\" with volunteer passengers.</p><p>\"I refer to it as the 'impossible-to-sail order' because no business could operate profitably,\" said Capt. John Murray, Port Canaveral's chief executive officer.</p><p>The CDC said guidance is coming soon. \"Future orders and technical instructions will address additional activities to help cruise lines prepare for and return to passenger operations in a manner that mitigates Covid-19 risk among passengers, crew members,\" spokesman Jason McDonald said, declining to comment further.</p><p>A White House spokesman didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>The order was written before vaccines were approved, and the CDC hasn't said whether it will revise the guidance to incorporate vaccinated crew and passengers.</p><p>Without CDC direction, cruise lines can't begin the monthslong process of implementing safety measures and recalling thousands of workers from around the world, industry officials said.</p><p>Washington's hesitancy might in part reflect the cruise industry's troubles at the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>Cruise lines continued sailing despite known risks from the coronavirus, an investigation by The Wall Street Journal found. Ports refused entry to ships with passengers sick with Covid-19, and giant vessels were stuck at sea.</p><p>As the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines picks up, President Biden is predicting a return to a sense of normalcy by July. Theme parks, casinos, airlines and hotels are operating with restrictions and safety measures, and the cruise industry said it can do the same.</p><p>\"I hate to speculate, but I think CDC looks at it and feels like, 'Is this a risk we really need to take?' \" said Brian Salerno, senior vice president of global maritime policy at Cruise Lines International Association, the cruise industry's main trade group. \"To have an industry sidelined like this, based on a bad perception, is a lot to ask.\"</p><p>Competitors are taking advantage of the vacuum.</p><p>Hong Kong-based Genting Cruise Lines said in a March 12 financial filing that Crystal Serenity would begin sailing from the Bahamas in July, disembarking in the Americas -- but bypassing U.S. and CDC jurisdiction. One week later, Royal Caribbean Group said it would send its own cruise out of Nassau in June, similarly avoiding U.S. ports.</p><p>Alaska-bound cruises face an extra hurdle. Most of those ships are foreign-flagged, so they would have to make a stop in Canada, because U.S. law forbids such ships from carrying passengers between U.S. ports. The problem: Canada has banned cruises until February 2022.</p><p>About 60% of all visitors to Alaska arrived by cruise ship in 2019, according to an October Federal Maritime Commission report.</p><p>U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both Republicans, have asked the Canadian government to reconsider its ban and introduced legislation to allow Alaska-bound cruise ships to bypass Canada. Either plan is predicated on the CDC allowing the resumption of cruises.</p><p>\"The CDC -- best scientists in the world. What they are not designed for is to be a regulator of tourism in America. They're not good at that,\" Mr. Sullivan said in an interview.</p><p>The pandemic wiped out, at least temporarily, what was a growth industry. In 2019, about 14 million cruise-goers departed from the U.S., generating a record $55.5 billion for the U.S. economy and supporting more than 436,000 U.S. jobs, according to the cruise lines association.</p><p>The industry's \"Big 3\" -- global cruise line operators Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. -- took major financial hits.</p><p>With revenue deeply depressed over the course of 2020, the companies raised cash with huge bond and stock issues, according to industry analysts and corporate filings. The Big 3 have told investors they have enough cash on hand to make it to the 2022 cruising season.</p><p>They also have aggressively pared expenses, furloughed workers and in some cases sold off older, less-efficient ships.</p><p>Even standing still is expensive. Carnival told investors in February that it expected to burn through an average of $600 million in cash a month just to keep vessels maintained, sustain corporate operations and invest in preparations to return to sea.</p><p>Cruise-related businesses, including ports, said they have been trying to call Washington's attention to their plight over the past year. Unions representing port workers on both coasts said workers have lost hundreds of thousands of hours since the pandemic hit.</p><p>In Port Canaveral, Phil Charlton, who has worked in the industry since 1985, has taken a part-time flower delivery job along with his wife, Olivia, also a port employee.</p><p>Now, passenger-less vessels pull into the terminal a few times a month for supplies and maintenance. On a recent afternoon, the Disney Fantasy blared a few melancholy strains of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" as it passed by Jetty Park.</p>",
