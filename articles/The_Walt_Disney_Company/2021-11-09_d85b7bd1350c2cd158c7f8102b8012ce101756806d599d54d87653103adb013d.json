  "title": "Movie Theaters Dodge Marvel's Bullet; Poor reviews didn't sink 'Eternals,' but a post-pandemic box office still can't afford many misses",
  "text": "<p>Still, the relative thumbs down didn't seem to hurt Disney and its movie-theater partners much in the pocketbook. \"Eternals\" pulled in a domestic box office of $71 million over its opening weekend, less than 6% below the opening take for the much-better-reviewed \"Shang Chi.\" But it is still the weakest domestic opening for a Marvel movie since 2015's \"Ant Man,\" according to data from Box Office Mojo. It is also below the $80 million that \"Black Widow\" managed earlier this year—a movie hobbled both by a summertime surge in Covid-19 cases as well as a simultaneous release on the Disney+ streaming service.</p><p>The movie-exhibition industry needs all the help it can get. With less than two months to go before the end of the year, the domestic box office has totaled a little under $3.2 billion in 2021. That is up from a little over $2 billion through all of last year, but still far below the $11 billion range averaged for the pre-pandemic years of 2015-19.</p><p>Theater stocks have so far shrugged off the lackluster debut. Cinemark shares jumped more than 17% Friday following a third-quarter report that showed better-than-expected revenue for the chain, and AMC Entertainment was up 8% Monday ahead of its own results, which also showed revenue ahead of Wall Street's projections. Both companies are anticipating a relatively strong fourth quarter and a much better 2022 given the backlog of many studio films that were delayed by the pandemic.</p><p>But even AMC chief Adam Aron, who has embraced his company's meme-stock status with gusto, sounded an uncharacteristically cautious note on Monday. \"We wish to emphasize that no one should have any illusions that there is not more challenge ahead of us still to be met,\" he said on the company's results call. And in a note Monday, Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley projected that even a \"robust '22 movie slate\" will only drive the 2022 box office to about 80% of 2019 levels.</p><p>\"Eternals\" could still end up doing well financially; even the worst \"Star Wars\" prequel grossed more than $1 billion globally. But the post-pandemic box office will be more reliant than ever on major blockbusters, as studios are pushing more content to their own streaming platforms. And Disney in particular has a lot staked on the Marvel universe, which figures heavily in the company's outlook for its theatrical business as well as its streaming service. \"Eternals\" is the 21st Marvel movie the company has put out, and \"Hawkeye,\" coming later this month, will be the fifth Marvel series for Disney+ this year—with at least four more expected for 2022.</p><p>When it comes to Marvel, Disney and its movie-theater partners can't really afford sequel fatigue.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Movie Theaters Dodge Marvel's Bullet</p>",
