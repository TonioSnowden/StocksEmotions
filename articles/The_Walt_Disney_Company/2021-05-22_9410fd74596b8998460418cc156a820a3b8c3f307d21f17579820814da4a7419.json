  "text": "<p>New details surrounding Bill Gates's departure from Microsoft's board last year have come to light. The Wall Street Journal reported that some of the tech giant's board members decided that Mr. Gates needed to step down from its board in 2020, as they pursued an investigation into the billionaire's prior romantic relationship with a female employee that was deemed inappropriate. Mr. Gates resigned before the investigation was completed and before the full board could make a formal decision on the matter. Microsoft shares lost 1.2% Monday.</p><p>AT&amp;T INC.</p><p>T -2.7%</p><p>AT&amp;T is unwinding its big bet on entertainment. The company reached a deal with Discovery Inc. to combine their media assets into a new, publicly traded company. AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia owns cable channels such as HBO, CNN and TBS as well as the Warner Bros. television and film studio. Discovery's portfolio includes its namesake network and HGTV. Both companies also offer streaming portals that compete with larger services like Netflix and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+. The new business will be led by current Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav. AT&amp;T dropped 2.7% Monday.</p><p>TARGET CORP.</p><p>TGT +1.3%</p><p>Shoppers are returning to stores and ready to spend. Target reported robust quarterly sales and a jump in store visits, maintaining momentum even as consumer buying habits changed during the pandemic. Meanwhile, larger rival Walmart Inc. reported comparable sales rose 6% in its latest quarter, and Macy's Inc. reported a jump in sales and swung back to a profit from the year-ago period. Target shares gained 1.3% Thursday.</p><p>ALPHABET INC.</p><p>GOOG +2.1%</p><p>Google is opening its first-ever permanent retail store in New York City. The Alphabet unit's store in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood will sell items such as Google's Pixel phones, Nest smart thermostats and Fitbit wearable devices, the company said Thursday. The tech giant's store will also provide repair and troubleshooting services, and host workshops on using Google products. Google has temporarily run pop-up shops in New York and Chicago in the past, but the Chelsea site will be its first permanent location. Alphabet shares rose 2.1% Thursday.</p><p>OATLY GROUP AB</p><p>OTLY +19%</p><p>Investors were thirsty for Oatly in its market debut. Shares of the Swedish oat-milk maker rose 19% Thursday in their first day of trading, giving the company a valuation of roughly $12 billion. Oatly's products are popular among consumers seeking healthier options that have less impact on the environment. The company boasts the backing of famous investors including Oprah Winfrey and Natalie Portman, as well as private-equity behemoth Blackstone Group Inc. Companies going public at this time are making a risky bet, as choppy markets have proved challenging for several of late.</p><p>CARNIVAL CORP.</p><p>CCL -0.5%</p><p>Cruise lines are budgeting for extra costs as they prepare to set sail from U.S. ports again. Carnival, which operates nine brands, forecasts additional spending in the hundreds of millions of dollars on enhanced sanitation, Covid-19 testing and other measures. The company sees costs needed to restart its ships as one-time expenses, while health protocol-related costs will depend on the duration for which they are needed. Cruise lines are vying to win back the public's trust after coronavirus outbreaks aboard ships last year brought sailings to a halt. Carnival shares lost 0.5% Thursday.</p><p>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.</p><p>JPM -1.4%</p><p>JPMorgan Chase is putting two contenders to succeed Chief Executive Jamie Dimon in charge of its sprawling consumer-banking operation. The bank on Tuesday said Chief Executive Officer of Consumer Lending Marianne Lake and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak are taking the reins from Gordon Smith, who will retire at the end of the year. The move comes two years after Ms. Lake and Ms. Piepszak took their current roles, establishing them as front-runners to one day run America's biggest bank. JPMorgan shares fell 1.4% Tuesday.</p>",
