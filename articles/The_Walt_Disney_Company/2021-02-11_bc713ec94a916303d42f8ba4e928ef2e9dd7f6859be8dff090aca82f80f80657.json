  "text": "<p>    Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. enjoyed a boost during the Covid-19 pandemic as lockdowns spurred parents to spend on everything from board games to Barbie dolls for their children. </p><p>   Now the toy makers are trying to determine whether new habits such as game night and playtime will remain once the pandemic subsides. They join others, from the makers of Purell hand sanitizer to Peloton bikes, in assessing their businesses. </p><p>   Widespread lockdowns and a lack of social interaction boosted U.S. toy sales 16% last year to more than $25 billion, according to research firm NPD Group Inc. Parents diverted spending on canceled vacations and summer camps to in-home diversions. Stimulus payments helped the industry too. </p><p>   Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said there is a good chance households that became interested in board games during the pandemic will buy more games, which is what families that already played board games did during lockdown. </p><p>   \"We brought in these new families who may have had some prior experience with gaming, but it wasn't really top of mind,\" Mr. Goldner said in an interview. \"We saw dedicated families certainly bought more deeply too.\" </p><p>   Hasbro's game business was the standout at the company last year, with sales up 15% despite some supply shortages during the holiday shopping season. </p><p>   Families that began playing together bought classic versions of such games as Monopoly and Operation. Others rounded out their collections with special versions such as a Monopoly game featuring the Baby Yoda character from the \"Star Wars\" spinoff \"The Mandalorian.\" </p><p>   Mr. Goldner expects the trends to carry over into strong sales this year. With the benefit of gift cards from the holidays, Hasbro's retail sales rose nearly 30% in January. </p><p>   For 2021, Mr. Goldner expects Hasbro's toys and game sales to grow faster than the broader industry, which he pegs at somewhere between 3% and 5% this year. Total company revenue, which includes the recent acquisition of the production company eOne and its Magic: The Gathering card game, is at least likely to have double-digit percentage growth, he said. </p><p>   Mattel finished the year on a strong note too, with net sales up 10% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Global sales were led by Barbie, up 19%, and Hot Wheels, up 13%, while the Fisher-Price and American Girl segments returned to growth after struggling for a long stretch. </p><p>   Mattel Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said sales gains in categories including dolls and toy cars came less from the pandemic than from long-running efforts to turn its brands around with new products and marketing, he said. </p><p>   \"We believe we are in a very good position because our categories weren't driven by Covid as much,\" he said in an interview. More broadly, he said the toy industry was projected to grow before the pandemic and that outlook hasn't changed. The company expects sales to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage rate in each of the next few years. </p><p>   \"The toy industry proved its resilience, it's a strategic category for retailers, it highlighted the importance of play,\" Mr. Kreiz said. \"Those fundamentals aren't changing.\" </p><p>   Toys tied to movie releases have suffered from the shutting of many theaters. Mr. Goldner said streaming content for Hasbro brands such as Peppa Pig, Transformers and Star Wars has helped lift demand for some of those products. Sales of Hasbro's Star Wars products, for example, were up 70% last year without a feature film, helped by items tied to the streaming series \"The Mandalorian.\" </p><p>   He expects that once the pandemic subsides and more people feel safer, people will crave returning to movie theaters to watch blockbuster movies. \"I think you're going to see a Roaring '20s kind of snapback,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
