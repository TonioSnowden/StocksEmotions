  "title": "Deaf Hollywood Is Getting Its Due; Months after 'CODA' won best picture, deaf actors, writers, directors and showrunners say its success has opened doors for them",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Kotsur said that people who have never experienced deaf culture can perceive an irrevocable communication gap between deaf and hearing people. \"Finally, I'm seeing that fear start to evaporate,\" he said. \"'CODA' is what bridged those two communities.\"</p><p>Major studios and celebrity producers are picking up projects that would have previously been dismissed, and filmmakers are placing deaf performers and creatives in high-profile roles. At the same time, children's shows and reality television have made greater efforts to showcase characters and participants who are deaf or hard of hearing. It's a major shift for an industry where deaf representation has been scarce.</p><p>\"I never really dreamed of becoming an actor because I've seen how hard it is within the deaf community,\" said Lauren Ridloff. She spent nearly a decade as an elementary school teacher in New York City before pursuing roles on the stage and screen. After appearing on Broadway in 2018 and landing a recurring part on \"The Walking Dead,\" she was cast as Makkari, a deaf superhero, in the Marvel Studios movie \"Eternals.\"</p><p>\"It's a beautiful way to explore what a superhero actually means,\" Ms. Ridloff said of the casting decision. In May, Ms. Ridloff landed a deal to executive produce and star in a series created by director Ava Duvernay and produced by Warner Bros. for the Starz network.</p><p>The contributions of deaf professionals to Hollywood are numerous, and date back to the silent-film era. Charlie Chaplin looked to deaf friends like the actor and artist Granville Redmond for cues on how to express himself through gesture, pose and facial expressions.</p><p>But it wasn't until a 22-year-old deaf actress named Marlee Matlin delivered a breakout performance in the 1986 film \"Children of a Lesser God\" that deaf actors started to move into the mainstream. The following year, she became the first deaf actor to win top honors at the Oscars.</p><p>Now, Ms. Matlin, who also starred in \"CODA,\" is tackling her first assignment as a director on the Fox series \"Accused,\" and she has signed on as executive producer of the Disney+ series starring Mr. Kotsur.</p><p>Shoshanna Stern, a deaf screenwriter, actress and producer, said in an interview that while she wrote obsessively as a kid, she never included deaf characters in her work. \"I never saw myself in any of the books I read,\" she said. \"I was so used to seeing myself in hearing people, because that's all I had.\"</p><p>Ms. Stern and her writing partner, Josh Feldman, had their first break as showrunners with \"This Close,\" a Sundance Now series that premiered in 2018. She has also written episodes for \"Echo,\" a Marvel Studios series starring the deaf actress Alaqua Cox, and signed on to write and star in \"Disquiet,\" a drama-thriller produced by AMC Networks Inc.</p><p>Though she is happy to have work, she said that certain barriers remain in writers' rooms. Ms. Stern said she identifies as \"culturally deaf,\" meaning that because American Sign Language is her first language, she thinks in ASL, and sometimes has to sign lines before putting them on the page. Her colleagues are not always understanding of this need, she said.</p><p>\"CODA\" showed that stories about deaf people can actually sell tickets, said the film's writer and director, Sian Heder, who also won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. Ms. Heder struggled to get financing for \"CODA\" after Lionsgate, the studio that owned the rights to the French film that it was loosely based on, dropped the project, forcing its creators to make it independently. Apple Studios bought the distribution rights after \"CODA\" was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021.</p><p>Ms. Heder first saw Mr. Kotsur perform at Deaf West, a theater company in Los Angeles that has become a bridge between the deaf talent community and the film industry.</p><p>\"There's no deaf artist who comes out of the blue, totally on their own,\" said David Kurs, Deaf West's creative director. </p><p>David Kurs, creative director of Deaf West, at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California.

Who is going to direct us?'\" He and his brother Del decided to do it themselves.</p><p>They are producing \"Flash Before the Bang,\" an autobiographical movie about the state-champion track team at the deaf high school in Oregon they both attended. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's Pearl Street Films is co-producing the film.</p><p>Inevitably, conversations about disability in films always return to Ms. Matlin, the Oscar-winner who, for decades, was the only face of Deaf Hollywood.</p><p>\"I had been doing it alone for a long time,\" said Ms. Matlin, whose acting credits include popular programs like \"Seinfeld\" and \"The West Wing.\" \"With 'CODA' now, suddenly it really hit the point home. People understand that there's more than just me.\"</p><p>Deaf Hollywood Is Getting Its Due</p>",
