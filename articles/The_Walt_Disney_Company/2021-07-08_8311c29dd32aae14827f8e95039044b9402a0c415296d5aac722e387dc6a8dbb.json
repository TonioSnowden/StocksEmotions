  "text": "<p>    If ever a superhero saga demanded -- and deserved -- to be taken on its own terms, \"Black Widow\" is the one. </p><p>   A Marvel adventure that forgoes Marvel templates, it doesn't pretend to be cosmic -- no chance of a supervillain like Thanos turning the other half of the people on our planet to dust. It isn't even epic, and certainly isn't flawless. Much of the production plays like a conventional espionage thriller, though one with some action sequences of spectacular elegance. In the grand and intricate scheme of things it's meant to serve mainly as a link between cycles of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and thus becomes the first of the new, post-\"Avengers: Endgame\" era. (\"Black Widow\" is playing in theaters and streaming on Disney+.) </p><p>   Yet it's an affecting link, a tribute to a fallen Avenger who died halfway through \"Avengers: Endgame\" in a startling act of self-sacrifice. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow figured importantly in several episodes, but did not have a movie of her own until this one, which was stylishly directed by the Australian filmmaker Cate Shortland (\"Somersault\") from a screenplay by Eric Pearson. Not only does the film explore Natasha's origins, it reconnects her after years of separation with her sister figure, Yelena Belova (sensational work by Florence Pugh, whose relatively brief career was already distinguished by standout performances in two films in 2019, \"Little Women\" and the horror tale \"Midsommar\"). And the flashbacking narrative addresses, with surprising subtlety, buoyant wit and fearless theatricality, several matters that superhero sagas aren't supposed to trouble themselves about. What are childhood memories made of? What constitutes a family in which children can, or cannot, feel loved? </p><p>   Those questions are framed by a preface, set in Ohio in 1995, that finds Natasha and Yelena -- portrayed as sweet-spirited girls by, respectively, Ever Anderson and Violet McGraw -- playing happily in lyrical slo-mo shots that might have been lifted from some Steven Spielberg vision of the American suburbs. But they are living in the bosom of a family that can't be taken at face value. David Harbour is the face of the father and Russian supersoldier Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian. Rachel Weisz is the mother, Melina Vostokoff aka the Iron Maiden. It's all fascinating, extremely strange and fatefully connected to a global program for KGB-trained assassins called Black Widows. </p><p>   Two decades later Natasha is off the grid and on the run, a former Russian spy pursued by an assortment of shadowy adversaries who want to kill her. Her death is far in the future, of course. \"Black Widow\" takes place before she became an Avenger, and gave her life for the sake of the supportive surrogate family she finally found. Still, our foreknowledge of her sacrifice deepens our feelings about present events, which include a family reunion under tumultuous circumstances, and both generations joining forces to destroy Dreykov (Ray Winstone), the monstrous head of the Red Room, where young women continue to be stripped of free will and turned into legions of Black Widows. </p><p>   With everything else going on in the film (which does bog down from time to time in standard-brand searches and chases), it's quite remarkable that its emotional center should be provided by a sisterly relationship that's the definition of fraught, and by a pair of killers who celebrate their reconnection by acting out their sibling conflicts in what looks like a fight to the death. But these are superb and perfectly complementary performances in a story that is, in its essence, about sisterly love. Ms. Johansson's Natasha is out there in the world with no guile, a powerful, fiercely earnest fighter who has suffered so many wounds of so many kinds that she doesn't think she can feel anymore. (Spoiler alert: she's wrong.) Ms. Pugh's Yelena is dryly self-ironic, shrewd and very, very funny -- a masterstroke of casting. Together they're electrifying, and terrifically entertaining. </p><p>   So are their violent excuses for parents. Melina has a dark history, but Ms. Weisz plays her with bright intelligence and steely purpose. (In one blithely surreal scene that ends up making perfect sense, the not-so-ex-Iron Maiden persuades a precocious pig to stop breathing.) Mr. Harbour makes Alexei a towering figure of midlife fury, at once a tattooed version of Rasputin the Mad Monk and, when he readies himself for new combat by donning his old Red Guardian outfit, a live-action counterpart of Bob Parr squeezing himself back into his Mr. Incredible suit. It's an enormous performance in a film that can fulfill its kinetic obligations and then, turning on a kopek under Ms. Shortland's lithe direction, set aside quiet time for the quasi-family to reflect on the rewards and regrets of those formative years in Ohio, when two ardent girls took what warmth they were able to find from a couple of vestiges of the Cold War. Who knew Marvel films could do that? </p><p></p>",
