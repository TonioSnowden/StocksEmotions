  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Disney's Coming Films to Hit Theaters First  ----  By Kimberly Chin",
  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co. said that the remainder of its films set to be released this year -- such as \"Encanto\" and \"West Side Story\" -- will be shown exclusively in theaters first. </p><p>   The move comes after Disney's latest box-office success with the Marvel film \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" which was released only in theaters. </p><p>   The film broke records for the highest-grossing film for the four-day Labor Day weekend. On Tuesday, Disney said the film had brought in $132.3 million. </p><p>   Disney's animated film \"Encanto\" will get a 30-day exclusive theatrical release, starting Nov. 24, before moving onto the Disney+ platform. </p><p>   Other releases include \"Eternals,\" \"The Last Duel,\" \"West Side Story,\" \"The King's Man,\" and \"Ron's Gone Wrong,\" and they are slated to run a minimum of 45 days exclusively in theaters. </p><p>   \"As confidence in moviegoing continues to improve, we look forward to entertaining audiences in theaters,\" said Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution Chairman Kareem Daniel. </p><p>   The entertainment sector has been hard-hit by pandemic-related restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. </p><p>   Earlier this year, Disney released \"Black Widow\" simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+. During its July 9 opening weekend, the film took in $80 million at the domestic box office and $78 million overseas, and generated another $60 million from $30 at-home purchases on Disney+. </p><p>   Weeks after the release, \"Black Widow\" star Scarlett Johansson sued the company, saying thesimultaneous release was a breach of contract and had hurt her financially. Disney has disputed those claims. </p><p>   Tensions have simmered between actors, producers and directors, and the entertainment industry's gatekeepers over compensation as the pandemic has disrupted the way entertainment is distributed and consumed. </p><p></p>",
