  "text": "<p>* Enphase Energy soared 22% premarket after the California solar energy company reported record revenue during the recent quarter. SolarEdge Technologies was also up, by 8.7%.</p><p>* Peloton Interactive edged down 0.4% premarket, just barely eating into Tuesday's 25% jump. The connected-bike maker is replacing its chief executive and cutting 2,800 jobs after a slowdown in demand caused its value to plummet.</p><p>* Chipotle Mexican Grill rose 6.7% ahead of the bell. The burrito chain's earnings beat analysts' expectations and it said it would open more locations than it previously anticipated.</p><p>* Lyft slipped 4% premarket. The ride-hailing company gave a cautious outlook though its quarterly revenue was up 70%.</p><p>* CVS Health slipped 2.1% premarket after it said it logged a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter impairment charge tied to the company's plan to shutter 900 stores over the next three years. The drugstore chain also posted higher revenue in the holiday quarter, lifted by the more than 20 million Covid-19 vaccines it administered in the period.</p><p>* Yum Brands shares added 1.5% premarket after it reported a revenue beat, though the parent of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell missed forecasts on profit.</p><p>* XPO Logistics added 5.7% premarket. The trucker and logistics services provider reported its fourth straight quarter of record revenue as high e-commerce demand increased reliance on the sector.</p><p>* Valvoline slipped 3.7% off hours. The automotive products and services company said its fiscal first quarter saw strong top-line growth but a flat profit.</p><p>* Uber, Disney, Mattel, Manulife Financial, Zynga and Equifax are among the companies reporting earnings after the close.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Banks are unlikely to pay depositors more after the Federal Reserve first lifts rates because the lenders don't need the money.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Enphase Energy, Chipotle, Peloton, Uber: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
