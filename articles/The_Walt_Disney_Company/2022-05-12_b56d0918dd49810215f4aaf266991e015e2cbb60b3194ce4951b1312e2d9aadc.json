  "title": "Stock Futures Fall as Inflation Weighs on Markets; Cryptocurrencies were broadly down, with bitcoin hitting its lowest level since 2020",
  "text": "<p>Stocks are coming under pressure due to concerns about the Federal Reserve's pullback of easy monetary policies as it combats the recent bout of high inflation. A data release on Wednesday showed that consumer prices had risen less quickly than the previous month, but still at a faster pace than economists had expected.</p><p>This fueled more worries that the central bank will raise interest rates at an aggressive pace, weighing on markets that had grown accustomed to loose monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 has lost over 4.5% this week so far. The Nasdaq Composite fell to its lowest level since November 2020.</p><p>\"Markets fear that central banks, by trying to tame inflation, might trigger a recession or at least a sharp economic downturn. When you look at the CPI data yesterday, maybe it's a little bit too early to call the peak of inflation,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.839% from 2.918% on Wednesday, edging down for a fourth consecutive trading session. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>\"Markets, on the margin, have shifted their probability toward a hard landing and toward further tightening from the Fed,\" said Karim Chedid, an investment strategist at BlackRock. The decline in longer-dated bond yields suggests that growth expectations have fallen, he said.</p><p>The producer-price index, another inflation metric, will be available at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists forecast that the prices suppliers charge businesses eased in April. Weekly jobless claims are also scheduled for the same time.</p><p>The dollar strengthened, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index rising 0.6% to the highest level since 2002. The index measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies continued to dive, with bitcoin falling more than 10% to $25,400, the lowest level since December 2020, before easing up to around $28,200. It has lost about 60% of its value since its peak last November. Ether declined 4% on Wednesday to trade around $1,950.</p><p>Earnings season continues apace, with WeWork, Six Flags Entertainment and Endeavor Group set to report on Thursday.</p><p>In premarket trading, Beyond Meat plunged more than 25% after the meat-alternative company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the last quarter due to higher spending. Coinbase fell 6%, extending its slide after losing more than a quarter of its value on Wednesday.</p><p>Walt Disney declined 5% after the company reported higher operating losses and its CFO said it may not maintain its current growth rate in streaming subscribers. Electric-car company Rivian Automotive rose 3% after executives said they expect supply-chain issues to ease later this year.</p><p>Oil prices slipped after U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected. Global benchmark Brent crude fell 1.3% to trade at $106.13 a barrel. Prices were also weighed down by slow progress on European Union negotiations to potentially ban Russian crude imports, according to analysts at ANZ.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2.2%. British investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown fell 6% after it reported a decline in assets under administration. Miner Antofagasta fell 5% after its CEO said copper supply is constrained by falling resource quality and long lead times.</p><p>European government bonds rallied, with Germany's 10-year bond yield falling to 0.875%, the lowest level this month.</p><p>A benchmark for Western European natural-gas prices rose 15% after Russia sanctioned several European gas supply chain companies on Wednesday evening, increasing risks of disruptions.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 2.2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.8%.</p><p>Hong Kong's monetary authority intervened in the foreign-exchange market to defend its currency peg for the first time in three years, spending $202 million.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Fall as Inflation Weighs on Markets</p>",
