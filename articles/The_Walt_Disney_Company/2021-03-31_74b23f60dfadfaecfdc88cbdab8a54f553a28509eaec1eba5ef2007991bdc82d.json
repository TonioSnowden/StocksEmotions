  "text": "<p>'The name Gogol has become synonymous with technology around the world,\" we are informed during the irresistible \"Made for Love,\" and no, that's not a typo: Byron Gogol (Billy Magnussen) is a tech billionaire, a futurist, a creepy mash-up of certain prominent social-media figures and a soulless nerdy tyrant. His peculiarities prompt a journalist to ask, \"Is Byron Gogol a genius savant living in an optimized world of his own creation? Or is he a megalomaniac narcissist who cannot function in normal society?\" His wife would pick No. 2. Thankfully, it's her show.</p><p>Hazel Gogol, nee Green -- played by the very wonderful Cristin Milioti -- is introduced in the opening moments of the story, wet and haggard, bursting from a hatch in the desert floor. She's just escaped, with the help of a dolphin, from The Hub, her husband's very smart home and Brutalist citadel, a place she hasn't stepped foot from in 10 years. The tunnel from which she's emerged -- breathless, slimy, gasping, half blinded by the light -- is certainly meant as a metaphorical (re)birth canal. But the umbilical cord is still in place: the Made for Love microchip that her husband has had surreptitiously implanted under her scalp. And through which he can trace her every move.</p><p>Is she going to get away? We'll find out. Maybe. Only four parts of the eight-part HBO Max series were available (three new episodes air Thursday, three the following Thursday and two on April 15). A la HBO, this doesn't bode well: The cable outlet never made the last episode of \"The Undoing\" available and look what happened: favorable reviews at the outset and an infuriating ending. (Conversely, Disney+ made only the first three episodes of \"Wandavision\" available, and they were the worst of the lot. Call it marketing genius.) The point is, the first installments of \"Made for Love\" are so good it would be a great shame if that quality isn't sustained.</p><p>From what can be seen, \"Made for Love\" occupies a sweet spot of satire, social critique and surveillance-state-inspired horror while still being hilarious, because it doesn't have to try. The humor is everywhere, naturally, whether in the curdled personality of Byron, the tenacity of Hazel and/or the absurdity of a consumer culture that would allow itself -- no, invite itself -- to be monitored by a system that wants to sell it things. Byron's latest brainstorm, the aforementioned Made for Love chip, is the stuff of horrified laughter: a device that would meld the minds of a loving couple into a single consciousness. No secrets. No flipping off your partner when he/she isn't looking. Byron doesn't even realize what a terrorist he is.</p><p>Meanwhile, the saucer-eyed Ms. Milioti is impossible not to watch, as Hazel strategizes her revolution against a force fueled with all the money in the world and an ego the size of Mountain View, Calif.</p><p>Based on the novel by the show's co-creator, Alissa Nutting, \"Made for Love\" features a multilayered storyline atop a tiered landscape of subtexts supported by a memorable cast that includes Ray Romano, as Hazel's single father, Herbert. Perpetually down on his luck, Herbert lives in a trailer with Diane, a love doll (\"synthetic partner,\" Herbert insists) who should get screen credit considering how many delightfully deadpan reaction shots she contributes. Diane is just one of the indications that we are not quite in present times but a few beats into the future, where the capacity of virtual-reality technology allows Byron to take Hazel to Rome, Paris, Luxor and Antarctica just during their first date (seen in flashback). She's wowed by bounty. And intrigued by a man who, unbeknown to her at the time, wants to make her into his own robotic plaything.</p><p>\"I knew the first time I saw you that we were similar creatures,\" Byron tells Hazel. Nothing could be further from the truth. When he met her, Hazel was selling $20 tickets for a phony Gogol Phone 5 raffle. (\"The 5 isn't even developed yet,\" he tells her moments later, having somehow gotten her cellphone number.) In another scheme, she stands with a basket outside a yoga class announcing a \"digital detox\" and collecting cellphones she then takes to a pawn shop (\"Namaste!\"). She's a hustler, a grifter, a schemer. On the run from a world that's spectacularly \"advanced\" and utterly joyless. You can't help but root for her.</p>",
