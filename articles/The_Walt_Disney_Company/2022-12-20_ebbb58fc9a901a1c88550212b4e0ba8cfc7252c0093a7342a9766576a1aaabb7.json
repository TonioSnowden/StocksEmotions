  "title": "Netflix's Ad-Supported Tier Was Its Least Popular Plan, Analytics Firm Estimates; Streaming giant's ad-backed plan accounted for 9% of new signups in the U.S. in November, according to subscription-analytics firm Antenna",
  "text": "<p>The goal for streaming services that launch lower-cost, ad-supported plans typically is to recruit as many new users as possible, while minimizing those who trade down from more expensive plans.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery-owned HBO Max, which launched its own $9.99-a-month ad-supported plan in June 2021, had stronger early results, according to Antenna. HBO Max's ad-supported plan accounted for 15% of new U.S. signups in the first month, and only 14% of the new customers were downgrading from its premium tier.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you buy an ad-supported version of Netflix? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>A Netflix spokeswoman said there were inaccuracies in Antenna's figures. \"It's still very early days for our ad-supported tier and we're pleased with its launch and engagement, as well as the eagerness of advertisers to partner with Netflix,\" she said.</p><p>Netflix launched the $6.99-a-month ad-supported plan in the U.S. on Nov. 3, part of a push to diversify its revenue and expand its subscriber base. Netflix's more expensive plans, which cost between $9.99 and $19.99 a month, come with additional features. Some include higher video quality and allow more than one user to stream at the same time.</p><p>\"Advertising for us is crawl, walk, run. We're definitely 'crawl' right now,\" said co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos earlier this month at an investor conference. Netflix hasn't publicly forecast how many new customers it expects the new plan to draw.</p><p>By the end of November, 0.2% of Netflix subscribers in the U.S. were on the ad-supported plan, Antenna estimated. The streaming giant's overall customer additions in the U.S. in November were lower than they were in October, Antenna found.</p><p>\"The new plan thus far is not moving the needle\" in boosting the average revenue Netflix gets from each subscriber, said Jonathan Carson, co-founder and chief executive of Antenna. \"Is this going to drive new incremental growth? It's super early,\" he said.</p><p>Antenna compiles data from third-party services that collect information from consumers, with their consent, such as online purchases, bills and banking records. That gives the company visibility into streaming subscriptions.</p><p>Netflix, which said it had 223 million customers globally at the end of September, joined a crowded field of streaming services with ad-supported tiers of service in the U.S. Walt Disney Co.-controlled Hulu and Disney+, Comcast Corp. NBCUniversal's Peacock, Paramount+, and HBO Max all offer ad-supported tiers of service.</p><p>Selling ads helps the companies generate more revenue, on average, from its users. Plus, consumers who may otherwise cancel a subscription could opt for a less costly ad-supported plan and stick around.</p><p>Disney+ earlier this month launched its own rival ad tier as part of a price increase. Customers who didn't want to pay the new $10.99-a-month price tag for an ad-free plan could continue to pay $7.99 monthly but would begin seeing ads.</p><p>For now, Netflix's ad tier is most similar to what has up to now been its basic, lowest-priced plan, which has typically been its least popular. Subscribers to the ad tier can stream on one device at a time. The ad-backed tier doesn't allow downloads. Mr. Sarandos said earlier this month that the company is likely to launch multiple ad-supported tiers of service over time.</p><p>\"Consumers have shown that with the right proposition, they'll really opt into advertising,\" Mr. Carson said.</p><p>In November, some 21% of HBO Max subscribers in the U.S. were on ad-backed plans, while 57% of Hulu subscribers used that type of plan, according to Antenna. Some 90% of Peacock subscribers are on its ad-supported plan, an NBCU spokesman said.</p><p>Netflix's Ad-Supported Tier Was Its Least Popular Plan, Analytics Firm Estimates</p>",
