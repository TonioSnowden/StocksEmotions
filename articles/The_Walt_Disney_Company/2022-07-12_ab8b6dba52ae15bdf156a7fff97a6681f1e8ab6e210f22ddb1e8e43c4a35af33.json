  "text": "<p>Booking a marine getaway these days is cheaper for multiple reasons. This time last year, cruise lines were sailing very few ships as they first returned to operation out of U.S. ports after the Covid-19 pandemic caused the industry to shut down. Today, multiple cruise lines have returned their full fleets to service -- providing travelers with a much wider array of options.</p><p>Flying to major ports can still be expensive. Plus, vaccine and testing mandates remain in place for most cruise lines, making it more difficult to fill staterooms.</p><p>The low prices for cruises have some people rethinking their travel plans. For many years, Edward O'Donnell has trekked to Solvang, Calif., for a personal retreat. Mr. O'Donnell, who lives in Camarillo, Calif., typically books cheap lodging. He spends his days sitting in bakeries or parks as he writes and mulls his life goals.</p><p>This year, instead of his usual getaway, Mr. O'Donnell booked a Carnival cruise. He and a friend split the cost of an inside stateroom. Mr. O'Donnell availed himself of the plentiful food in the ship's cafeteria, entertainment offerings and quiet areas of the ship where he could relax and reflect.</p><p>He estimates he spent less than $500 on the four-day trip from Long Beach, Calif., that visited Mexico's Baja California Peninsula. The only additional cost to the base rate was one onshore excursion. \"It was cheaper than a Motel 6,\" says Mr. O'Donnell, 74 years old.</p><p>An inside cabin on a five-night cruise to the Caribbean, the Bahamas or Bermuda in July costs $619 a person on average, according to data collected by cruise-review website Cruise Critic, a subsidiary of Tripadvisor. That is down from $684 a person last July. Those prices don't include taxes and fees.</p><p>\"We've never seen pricing this low,\" says David Crooks, senior vice president of product and operations at World Travel Holdings, a Boston-based travel agency that operates multiple cruise-booking sites including CruisesOnly and Cruises.com.</p><p>A spokesman for Carnival Corp. says that cruises grow in popularity during times of rising inflation, given the inclusive nature of the experience.</p><p>Some travelers remain hesitant to get on board with the pandemic continuing, while ongoing vaccination and testing requirements have caused other people to opt against going on cruises, says Lesley Sawhook, co-owner of Cincinnati-based travel agency Exclusive Travel Partners. She attributes some of the cruise deals to the limited demand stemming from those issues.</p><p>Disney Cruise Line, which requires anyone over age 5 to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with some limited exceptions, has offered deals of up to 35% off fares. Discounts that large are unusual for Disney, Mrs. Sawhook notes. Disney didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Here are some additional tips from travel experts to save money on a cruise vacation:</p><p>-- Watch out for fees and taxes. Most sites don't include the cost of taxes and port fees in the cruise fares they advertise. So a sailing that appears cheaper could be more expensive than other itineraries after including those additional costs.</p><p>-- Try a travel agent. Agents often have access to discounts and group rates not advertised to the general public.</p><p>-- Track prices after you book. Most cruise lines will match prices if a better deal comes along after you book, up until around two months before a cruise.</p><p>-- Book your next trip before you get off the ship. While the onboard offers for future cruises may not be as good as they once were, travel agents say these deals are often unparalleled.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
