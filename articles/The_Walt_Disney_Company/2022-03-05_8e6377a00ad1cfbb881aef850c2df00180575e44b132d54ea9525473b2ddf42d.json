  "text": "<p>Disney called the ad-supported version of Disney+ a “building block” for the company's goal of reaching 230 million to 260 million subscribers worldwide by the end of its 2024 fiscal year. Through 2021, the 2-year-old Disney+ has accumulated 129.8 million paid customers worldwide, with the addition of 11.8 million in its last quarter.</p><p>“Expanding access to Disney Plus to a broader audience at a lower price point is a win for everyone — consumers, advertisers, and our storytellers,” Kareem Daniel, chairman of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, said in a statement Friday. “More consumers will be able to access our amazing content. Advertisers will be able to reach a wider audience, and our storytellers will be able to share their incredible work with more fans and families.”</p><p>Disney's streaming rivals Netflix Inc. NFLX and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN do not offer ad-supported options, with Netflix showing little interest in such a format. AT&amp;T Inc.'s T WarnerMedia, soon to merge with Discovery, added an ad version of HBO Max in June.</p><p>Paramount Global's PARA Paramount+ and Comcast Corp.'s CMCSA Peacock have ad-free and ad-supported plans.</p><p>Disney shares closed down 3% in trading Friday, and have slipped 9% so far this year.</p><p>&#xa0;</p>",
