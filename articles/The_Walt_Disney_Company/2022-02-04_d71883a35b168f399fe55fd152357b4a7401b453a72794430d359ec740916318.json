  "text": "<p>   Spike Lee will direct a new documentary about Colin Kaepernick that aims to capture the story of the former National Football League quarterback and activist, known for his decision to kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. </p><p>   Mr. Lee and Mr. Kaepernick are collaborating on the multipart documentary and production on it has begun, ESPN Films said. It didn't announce a title or release date. </p><p>   Mr. Lee is known for directing films such as \"Do the Right Thing\" and the biopic \"Malcolm X.\" The director \"plans to use extensive new interviews and a vast never-before-seen archive to help Kaepernick tell his story from his perspective,\" ESPN Films said in a statement. Former ESPN anchor and writer Jemele Hill will be a producer. </p><p>   Walt Disney Co., which owns ESPN, reached a first-look deal with Ra Vision Media, Mr. Kaepernick's production arm, in 2020. </p><p>   At the time, Disney said the partnership would \"focus on telling scripted and unscripted stories that explore race, social injustice and the quest for equity, and will provide a new platform to showcase the work of Black and Brown directors and producers.\" </p><p>   Mr. Kaepernick narrated a drama series released last year on Netflix called \"Colin in Black &amp; White\" that recounted the football player's formative years. That series was created by Mr. Kaepernick and filmmaker Ava DuVernay. </p><p>   The former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers began kneeling during the national anthem in 2016 in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. Mr. Kaepernick has since gone unsigned by an NFL team. </p><p></p>",
