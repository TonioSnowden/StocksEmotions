  "title": "Disney, Scarlett Johansson Work Out Agreement Over 'Black Widow' Contract; Actor had claimed her contract was breached when film made its debut both on Disney+ and in theaters",
  "text": "<p>Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.</p><p>Ms. Johansson had been seeking as much as $80 million from Disney on top of the $20 million salary she received for the film, people familiar with the matter had said. Ms. Johannson had argued that by putting the movie on Disney+ simultaneously with its theatrical release her potential bonus from the film's box office was harmed.</p><p>Disney countered that it was within its rights to put the movie on Disney+ per its agreement with Ms. Johansson and that it did so because of the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the theatrical business. Disney had called the suit \"especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>In a statement disclosing the settlement, Disney Studios Chairman Alan Bergman said, \"I'm very pleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement with Scarlett Johansson regarding Black Widow.\"</p><p>He went on to say the company was working with her on a number of coming projects including \"Tower of Terror,\" based on the Disney theme park ride of the same name.</p><p>Ms. Johansson said she was happy to resolve the dispute and is \"incredibly proud of the work we've done together over the years and have greatly enjoyed my creative relationship with the team.\"</p><p>Disney, Scarlett Johansson Work Out Agreement Over 'Black Widow' Contract</p>",
