  "title": "Business News: Disney CEO Joins Opposition To Florida LGBTQ Measure",
  "text": "<p>For the last week, Disney employees, contractors and fans, many of whom live in Florida and work at Disney World, have been pressuring the company on social media and in online petitions to take a public stand against the Parental Rights in Education bill, called by opponents the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday. When Disney executives said they wouldn't -- and that their inclusion efforts were best focused on representation in Disney programming -- the outcry only grew louder.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Chapek told shareholders: \"We were opposed to the bill from the outset, but we chose not to take a position on it. . .because we felt we could be more effective behind the scenes.\"</p><p>The shareholder meeting was Mr. Chapek's first without his predecessor, longtime CEO Robert Iger, at the company. Mr. Chapek's address to the gathering in Burbank, Calif., included details on his metaverse plans and the success of the animated film \"Encanto.\"</p><p>Yet, Mr. Chapek spent much of the meeting fielding questions about the company's response to the Florida bill. The discussion highlights the complexities for executives leading a company when employees and fans all have personal social-media platforms to speak from and there is an expectation that executives will weigh in on charged issues.</p><p>Few issues have engulfed a consumer-facing company with such speed, especially for Disney, which has touted itself as an inclusive employer committed to putting LGBTQ stories on screen.</p><p>The Florida bill prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in certain grade levels at schools and allows parents to put limits on services provided at schools.</p><p>LGBTQ activists have said the bill will harm children struggling with their sexual and gender identity by cutting off support from teachers and encouraging teachers to out gay students to their parents.</p><p>The bill's sponsors have defended it as a way of letting families deal with children's issues rather than teachers. The bill is aimed at children in kindergarten through the third grade.</p><p>Mr. Chapek said Mr. DeSantis had agreed to meet with him and LGBTQ members of Disney's senior leadership to discuss the company's concerns about the bill.</p><p>Disney has also signed onto a letter from the Human Rights Campaign disavowing the bill and pledged to donate $5 million to LGBTQ causes, he said.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Mr. DeSantis confirmed the phone call, saying \"this is the first time we have heard from Disney\" regarding the legislation and that no in-person meeting had been scheduled yet.</p><p>\"The governor's position has not changed,\" the spokeswoman said. \"The same Florida parents who take their families to Disney also support parental rights in education, because they do not want their young children exposed to inappropriate content about sex and gender theory at school,\" she added.</p><p>Later in the annual meeting, Mr. Chapek faced questions from shareholders about his response and his talk with Mr. DeSantis.</p><p>He said he had an \"extraordinary conversation\" with the governor about how the legislation was drafted. Mr. Chapek said Mr. DeSantis suggested Disney executives look at the legislation as written and then discuss \"which aspects were most concerning.\"</p><p>On Monday, in response to the pressure, Mr. Chapek sent an email to all Disney employees saying the company's leadership team felt it would be counterproductive for the company to take a public stance.</p><p>\"As we have seen time and again, corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds,\" Mr. Chapek said in Monday's statement.</p><p>That response amplified critics who wanted to hear more from the employer.</p><p>---</p><p>Erich Schwartzel contributed to this article.</p>",
