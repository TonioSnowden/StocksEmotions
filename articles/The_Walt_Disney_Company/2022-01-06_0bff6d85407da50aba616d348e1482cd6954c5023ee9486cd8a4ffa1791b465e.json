  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Arts in Review -- Film Review:  Discovering  Roberto  Gavaldon  ----  By David Mermelstein",
  "text": "<p>   In addition to housing Hollywood memorabilia, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, which opened late last year, screens films at two superb theaters located within -- one, the 288-seat Ted Mann, sits in a newly excavated basement below the repurposed May Company department store that houses the museum; the other, attached to the main structure via a skywalk, is the 1,000-seat David Geffen, whose exterior uncannily resembles the Death Star of \"Star Wars\" fame. </p><p>   The film programs are especially welcome not just because nothing celebrates moving images better than movies themselves, but also because these screenings fill a yawning gap left when the neighboring Los Angeles County Museum of Art gutted its vaunted cinematheque back in 2009. (Ironically, LACMA happens to own the land on which the Academy Museum sits.) </p><p>   Among the inaugural offerings is a 10-picture tribute to the Mexican filmmaker Roberto Gavaldon, who died in 1986 at age 77. Running Jan. 6 through 23, it's an especially apt choice given Mexico's geographic proximity to the museum. But even more important, it brings much-needed attention to a national cinema largely unknown to most American movie lovers, even in this heavily Hispanic city. In fact, this is the first of three series devoted to Mexican films that the museum plans to present between now and the end of 2023. </p><p>   Gavaldon, as versatile as he was prolific, began directing in the mid-1930s and didn't stop until the late 1970s. The films in this series, all in black-and-white and recently restored, date from between 1946 and 1962 and represent about a fifth of his output. They are also exemplars of Mexican moviemaking during its golden era -- when Gavaldon worked with major figures like the cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa and the actors Dolores del Rio, Pedro Armendariz, Maria Felix and Arturo de Cordova. </p><p>   The series opens with \"Rosa Blanca\" (1961), \"White Rose,\" an overtly political tragedy in which a principled rancho owner (the extraordinary Ignacio Lopez Tarso) vainly attempts to elude the grasp of ruthless foreign oil interests. One of four films in this retrospective shot by Figueroa, it is the second of the director's three adaptations of material by the mysterious European-born novelist known as B. Traven -- best remembered as the author of \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\" </p><p>   \"La Otra\" (1946), \"The Other One,\" is the first of five pictures Del Rio made with Gavaldon, and the most audacious. She plays twins: Magdalena, an elegant, scheming social climber; and Maria, a demure manicurist. But when the former's husband dies, leaving her fabulously rich, the sisters' relationship shifts radically. Gavaldon rachets up the tension as assuredly as Hitchcock might, but he is just as interested in the sisters' vastly different social strata. </p><p>   The endlessly watchable De Cordova appears in three of these films. In \"La Diosa Arrodillada\" (1947), \"The Kneeling Goddess,\" he falls prey to the dark charms of a model and showgirl played by Felix, whose mere proximity puts notions of murder in his head. And in the utterly engrossing \"En la Palma de Tu Mano\" (1951), \"In the Palm of Your Hand,\" he plays a charmingly amoral mentalist who allows avarice to destroy his perfectly comfortable life. </p><p>   \"La Noche Avanza\" (1952), \"Night Falls,\" is the juiciest of the three roles the versatile Armendariz has in this series, portraying an arrogant jai-alai star who treats his teammates almost as badly as he does the women he seduces. But even the luckiest cads face a reckoning eventually. </p><p>   Beyond \"Rosa Blanca,\" two more of Gavaldon's finest films, both Traven-inspired, also star Mr. Lopez Tarso, who made five films with the director and is still acting at age 96. He plays opposite Pina Pellicer in both. She, alas, died by suicide at age 30, not long after completing these pictures. \"Dias de Otono\" (1962), \"Autumn Days,\" charts the odd choices of a naive country girl who comes to work in a big-city bakery and spins ever-more elaborate fantasies to impress her coworkers while her concerned boss frets but fails to act. \"Macario\" (1960), the first Mexican movie to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, is a fable set in colonial Mexico, with Mr. Lopez Tarso as the eponymous protagonist, a benighted woodcutter. Like the Japanese masterpieces \"Ugetsu\" and \"The Naked Island,\" it gathers force slowly and effortlessly mixes quotidian detail with profound, but not pretentious, life questions bound to leave audiences reeling. </p><p>   Gavaldon's gift for mise-en-scene, the uncommon empathy his films summon, his knack for casting precisely the right actors -- all this, and more, confirms his enduring significance. But the complexity of the moral universe within his pictures may be their most compelling feature, with certainty often absent or at least hard to find. The characters in these movies, unlike their Hollywood counterparts, are rarely entirely good or bad. Instead, they are like most of us, confused and struggling. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Mermelstein writes for the Journal on film and classical music. </p><p></p>",
