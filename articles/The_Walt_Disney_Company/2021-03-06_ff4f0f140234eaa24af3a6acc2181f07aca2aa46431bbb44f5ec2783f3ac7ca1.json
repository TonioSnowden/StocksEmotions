  "title": "U.S. News:  California Will Allow  Theme Parks to Open  ----  By Erich Schwartzel",
  "text": "<p>   California on Friday paved the way for Walt Disney Co.'s Disneyland and other attractions across the state to reopen as soon as next month, according to new easing of Covid-19 restrictions. </p><p>   Under guidelines announced by the California Department of Public Health, amusement parks, stadiums and ballparks can reopen at 15% capacity, starting on April 1 if certain test-positivity rates are met. However, Disneyland won't resume operations under the most restrictive tier that still allows theme parks to reopen because it limits capacity at 15%. </p><p>   The new guidelines could also drive activity in other industries, including live music and sports. </p><p>   Opening the park at less than 25% capacity doesn't make economic sense, said a person familiar with the matter. If Covid-19 rates continue to fall as projected, though, Disney and other businesses could move into a zone that allows for 25% capacity by mid-April, this person said. Ken Potrock, the president of Disneyland Resort, said the company would be announcing an opening date soon. </p><p>   Disneyland has been closed for nearly a year since the pandemic spread across the U.S., but unlike its counterpart in Florida, it remained shut even as restrictions across the country have loosened. </p><p>   \"With case rates and hospitalizations significantly lower, the arrival of three highly effective vaccines and targeted efforts aimed at vaccinating the most vulnerable communities, California can begin gradually and safely bringing back more activities,\" said Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency. </p><p>   So far, California has administered about 10 million vaccine doses, according to the state. </p><p>   The updated guidance is welcome news to executives at Disney, who have publicly dueled with California officials over the right to reopen. The company's theme park in Florida has been operating at reduced capacity since last July. </p><p>   Reopening the California park will take several weeks. The company has tens of thousands of employees on furlough and will need to negotiate with unions to bring those workers back and retrain them. </p><p>   A United Food and Commercial Workers local chapter that represents some Disney employees said Friday that its members \"are excited to go back to work.\" </p><p>   Disney shares ticked up more than 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. </p><p></p>",
