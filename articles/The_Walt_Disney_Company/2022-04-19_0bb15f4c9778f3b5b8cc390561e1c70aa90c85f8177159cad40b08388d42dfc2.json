  "title": "Olivia Rodrigo Teams Up With Beauty Startup Glossier; Long-term partnership, which includes curated makeup set, comes as beauty startup looks to regain some luster after layoffs",
  "text": "<p>The New York-based company is valued at more than $1 billion by its venture backers.</p><p>Glossier on Tuesday promoted the Grammy Award-winning pop star's favorite beauty products on its website, where customers could purchase a makeup set curated by Ms. Rodrigo.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Glossier declined to disclose financial terms of the agreement, but said the company and Ms. Rodrigo agreed to a long-term contract. Ms. Rodrigo also stars in a new ad campaign for Glossier.</p><p>Glossier's partnership with Ms. Rodrigo comes a few months after the beauty company told staff it was laying off a chunk of its corporate employees. Glossier said in January it would pivot its focus to its skin-care and makeup business, and scale back on some of its technology efforts. A company representative at the time said more than 80 jobs were eliminated.</p><p>The partnership with Ms. Rodrigo, one of the hottest music acts of the past year, puts Glossier on track to revitalize its brand, said Sonia Summers, founder and chief executive of Beauty Barrage, a sales management company. \"It's like their second coming,\" she said.</p><p>\"They still have a lot of good that they create, so they just needed to find the right Gen-Z personality that can help take them there. And I think it's brilliant with Olivia,\" Ms. Summers added.</p><p>Ms. Rodrigo, 19 years old, has become a Gen Z icon, with even the White House enlisting her as it sought to boost Covid-19 vaccines among young people. She starred in the Disney+ series \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\" before releasing her debut album \"Sour\" last year. Her hit \"drivers license\" was the most streamed song globally on Spotify in 2021.</p><p>Glossier was launched in 2014 and came out of Into the Gloss, the beauty website. It closed its physical locations back in 2020, but then opened a few stores in the U.S. and London last year.</p><p>Write to Camille Furst at camille.furst@wsj.com and Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Olivia Rodrigo Teams Up With Beauty Startup Glossier</p>",
