  "text": "<p>\"We just thought, you know what? A lot of people have the 12-foot skeleton,\" Ms. Davis says. \"But nobody has a moving sarcophagus with my husband's last name on it. So let's build it.\"</p><p>Halloween decorations and costumes have been haunted by a backlog of container ships at U.S. ports, causing delays and shortages. This year, many consumers are resorting to do-it-yourself alternatives. They often need extra backup plans as even raw materials for their home-brew costumes grow scarce.</p><p>Hilary Wilkes, a 43-year-old mother of two in Highlands, N.C., had to think quickly to please her 6-year-old daughter, Annie. Ms. Wilkes waited until recently to buy her kids' costumes because \"as with most children, they change their minds frequently,\" she says.</p><p>By the time Annie had her heart set on the character Willa the werewolf, a character in the Disney Channel movie \"Zombies 2,\" its costume was sold out everywhere Ms. Wilkes looked. So was a stand-alone Willa wig.</p><p>Determined to find a solution, Ms. Wilkes and her daughter developed a hybrid costume that combines a generic zombie cheerleader with a pair of high-tops, her brother's old soccer socks (to be drenched in fake blood), silver spray paint for the hairstreak and a smoky eye courtesy of Ms. Wilkes's eye shadow palette.</p><p>\"She wasn't thrilled, but she rolled with it,\" Ms. Wilkes says. \"And it will be unique to her.\"</p><p>Stephanie Zoran, a 37-year-old nurse in Oswego, Ill., scrounged together some cardboard boxes from neighbors to build a costume for her toddler, Max, who wanted to be some kind of construction vehicle. The store-bought tractor-digger costume he liked was sold out online and in her local stores.</p><p>\"The most challenging part was that my kids wanted to help, and I just wanted to get it done,\" said Mrs. Zoran. \"I'm like, you're three, you can't use a box cutter, sorry.\"</p><p>Isaac Vargas found himself in over his head when he started building his own Halloween decorations as a distraction from the pandemic. Trying to create a 4.5-foot-tall pumpkin out of Styrofoam blocks, he struggled to get the ridges right. He tried various knives to carve the lines before getting a tip from another DIY-er that a curry comb, used to remove debris from horses' coats, might do the trick.</p><p>\"I was just winging it,\" says Mr. Vargas, who works in airport operations in Mount Holly, N.C. \"Between the months of July and October, I had no social life.\"</p><p>Those who have been patiently waiting for Halloween costumes and decorations to come back in stock may be out of luck or facing higher prices, says Craig Austin, a professor of logistics and supply-chain management at Florida International University.</p><p>\"The capacity of the supply chain is 100% maxed out, whether we're talking about costumes or candy corn,\" Mr. Austin says.</p><p>Raw materials aren't immune to the supply-chain delays either. Ms. Davis and Mr. Vargas had trouble finding insulation and expanding foam, often used to seal gaps in walls and windows, which are popular for homemade props. Mr. Vargas also pivoted away from building scarecrows when he noticed the high prices on wood this year.</p><p>Arlene's Costumes, a family-run shop in Rochester, N.Y., quickly sold out of licensed products, like costumes for Star Wars characters and the Scream mask, says marketing manager Terry Sinopoli. The store also saw more orders of components like false mustaches and hats this year, signaling more people are piecing together their own versions of costumes.</p><p>Matt Milano, a history teacher in West Haven, Conn., was eager to celebrate the first Halloween of his baby daughter and nephew with a Rugrats-themed family costume. He hoped to find a pair of baby-sized costumes for the twin characters Lil and Phil DeVille from the TV series, but was blown away by the prices.</p><p>\"It was $90 for the cheapest one I saw, and others were even more than that,\" Mr. Milano says. \"So I looked at what was done and I said, 'I can do that.'\"</p><p>He plans to piece together a Lil costume from felt, staples and glue.</p><p>In Orlando, Fla., Ms. Davis, 43, and Mr. Cagle, 40, were dead set, despite little building experience, on crafting a homemade crypt using their combined skills. She is an artist and he is a software engineer.</p><p>Mr. Cagle used a computer program to map the dimensions and layout of the coffin, while Ms. Davis planned paint colors and font lettering.</p><p>Six weeks, several coats of waterproof paint and one stray plastic sword later, the crypt of their imaginary vampire character, Count Von Cagle, was nearly ready for display.</p><p>\"Every time we pass it, we actually say, 'Wow. I can't believe we made this,'\" she says. \"It's not perfect, but it's almost better because it's our own.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
