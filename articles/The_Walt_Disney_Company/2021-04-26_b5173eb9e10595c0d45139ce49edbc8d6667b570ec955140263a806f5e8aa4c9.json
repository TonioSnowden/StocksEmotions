  "text": "<p>The austere and graceful drama <em>Nomadland </em>was the biggest winner at the 93rd Academy Awards on Sunday, capturing Best Picture, Best Director for Chloé Zhao and Best Actress for Frances McDormand.</p> <p>The victories capped an Oscars ceremony <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eb30726-2a05-4d57-b62f-1adc60318d70\">modified</a> for the Covid-19 pandemic, with the ceremony held in front of a pared-down live audience after a year in which the film industry was devastated by cinema closures and delayed movie releases.</p> <p>Zhao was the first woman of colour and the second woman to win the top directing prize. The awards for <em>Nomadland </em>also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a2e9b05-463d-491c-af4e-2b0466cb8c63\">marked a triumph</a> for Walt Disney and the Hollywood establishment, as streaming company Netflix missed out on any of the biggest prizes.</p> <p>McDormand, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1267f3be-14ee-4dbe-8ae9-30d1f996c901\">starred in <em>Nomadland</em></a> and co-produced the movie with Zhao, pleaded with viewers to return to cinemas. “Please watch our film on the largest screen possible,” she said.</p> <p>The Oscars included several historic wins, after years of criticism that the awards did not recognise diversity, most notably during the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca2e8368-48e6-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441\">#OscarsSoWhite</a> campaign in 2015. Yuh-Jung Youn became the first Korean woman to win Best Supporting Actress for her role in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e71e8e33-3aef-490b-9704-8dfd8799ee1b\"><em>Minari</em></a>, while Daniel Kaluuya won the Best Supporting Actor prize for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d6e0383-9c83-47eb-b75f-f2e16aa6de8f\"><em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>The evening's biggest upset was reserved for the final award, with Anthony Hopkins winning Best Actor for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7214ea00-a4b7-460a-8c29-e580e9d89d7f\"><em>The Father</em></a>. The prize was widely expected to be awarded posthumously to Chadwick Boseman, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b03c813e-e9eb-11ea-8cbe-db08f43b5ca5\">died aged 43</a> from colon cancer last summer, for his performance in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ca3f9cb-f092-4e02-9c6c-6fb558943b72\"><em>Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</em></a>.</p> <p>The film industry has been disrupted over the past 14 months by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f84283b9-4cc2-4d89-81f7-f2554ab045dd\">cinema closures</a>, the turbocharged <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f33e9b9-2a4b-4562-98a0-1dd52e317abb\">shift to streaming</a> and increasingly icy relations between the US and China.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb3921e-6335-4a50-bcd2-4bbf5ad6e091'\">Zhao</a>, who was born in Beijing and went to boarding school in the UK, quoted from <em>The Three Character Classic,&#xa0;</em>a Confucian text that is almost universally studied in Chinese school: “This is for anyone who had the faith and the courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves,” she said in her acceptance speech.</p> <p>But her remarks&#xa0;— and almost all coverage of the Oscars&#xa0;— were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e8d38d6-65c1-4b2c-9da6-37977a7b9b3d\">censored in China</a>, the world's biggest film market by revenue. Beijing ordered local media outlets not to cover the event after <em>Do Not Split,</em>&#xa0;a documentary about the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong,&#xa0;was nominated for Best short documentary.</p> <p>Zhao faced a backlash by Chinese nationalists in March after they found a 2013 interview in which she appeared to say “there are&#xa0;lies everywhere” in China. The controversy led to the cancellation of the release of <em>Nomadland</em> in the country.</p> <p>Actress Regina King opened the ceremony by invoking the verdict in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61e75e3c-e964-42d5-8fbb-f97d753387bb\">Derek Chauvin's trial</a> last week. The former Minneapolis police officer was convicted of three charges in the murder of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db9f27d5-0f03-45e7-8925-ed24a97c7639\">George Floyd</a>, an incident that set off global protests over racial injustice. “If things had gone differently in Minneapolis I might have traded in my heels for marching boots,” she said.</p> <p>Mia Neal, who became the first black woman to win the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling for <em>Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</em>, said: “one day it won't be unusual, it won't be groundbreaking, it will just be normal”.</p> <p>The evening was a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1e8d8d4-bd3e-4b73-b4d0-446886c88516\">disappointment for Netflix</a>, however, which fell short in the top categories.</p> <p>The streaming company has long sought a Best Picture award, and entered Sunday's ceremony with two candidates: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe03c88f-8452-4ef5-968f-eb3f899329b9\"><em>Mank</em></a>, which earned the most overall nominations at 10, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d04ea484-9e16-4745-90da-aff94d181684\"><em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em></a><em>. </em>The former, a black-and-white homage to old Hollywood, earned honours for cinematography and production design.</p> <p>It remained unclear if consumers will opt to watch feature films through streaming services or return to cinemas as the pandemic eventually eases. Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-chief executive, told analysts last week that the company was “not really changing the way we make films for the way people watch film”.</p> <p>The Oscars ceremony, as with the music industry's Grammy Awards <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8f7a222-b0ee-488d-b506-688d005408ee\">last month</a>, took a sharp departure from tradition. The event took place at a makeshift stage at Los Angeles's Union Station and the broadcast largely eschewed the replays of movie clips and soaring music performances from nominees typical in previous years.</p> <p>Ratings for the Oscars will not be available until later in the week but pandemic-era awards shows and prominent sporting championships, including the Grammys and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57ce7612-ab50-4311-9254-ef6579e2a2d6\">Super Bowl</a>, have fallen to historic lows.</p><p>Source: Sara Germano in New York and Christian Shepherd in Beijing 2021 '‘Nomadland' wins Best Picture, Director and Actress Oscars' FT.com 26 April.
