  "title": "Want to Watch Every Mets Game? You'll Need Some Streaming Subscriptions; Major League Baseball's new deals with Apple TV+ and Peacock are making it more complicated—and expensive—for fans to watch their team's games.",
  "text": "<p>Instead, the Mets' contest against the Washington Nationals will be shown exclusively on Apple TV+, marking the fledgling streaming service's entrance into live sports. The company reached a deal with MLB last month to air a weekly Friday night double-header, a move with potentially significant implications for baseball's future. The games will be free to anyone with internet access for at least the first 12 weeks, but they are expected to be available only to subscribers at some point.</p><p>Apple is starting with a splash. Scherzer—whose newly signed contract with the Mets will pay him a record annual salary of $43.3 million—is slated to be on the mound for the first time in his new uniform. Still, the idea of baseball being on a platform like Apple TV+ is apparently so foreign that Wednesday, Mets owner Steve Cohen took to Twitter to remind people where to find the game, adding, \"It will not be broadcast on SNY.\"</p><p>It isn't just Apple. There will be 18 Sunday games on NBCUniversal's Peacock, beginning May 8, some of which will start as early as 11:30 a.m. ET. All but the first will be exclusive to the service. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video has an exclusive package of 21 New York Yankees games this season. Amazon owns a stake in the Yankees' YES Network.</p><p>That means Yankees fans in the New York area who want to watch all of their favorite team's games in 2022 will need access to YES, ESPN, Fox, Prime Video, Apple TV+ and Peacock. The games once reserved for PIX11, a free over-the-air station in New York, will now instead only be aired on Amazon.</p><p>\"I'm going to sit down on a Saturday and not know which app I need to use to watch a ballgame that day,\" said Joshua Diemert, a 27-year-old Yankees fan who writes for the blog Pinstripe Alley. \"It is just not a convenient way to deliver baseball to people.\"</p><p>There is no doubt that sports have become enamored with streaming services, which are hungry for content and willing to pay handsomely. Starting this fall, Amazon is spending more than $1 billion annually for the rights to put a single NFL game on its Prime Video platform every Thursday.</p><p>Baseball's foray into this space raises questions about the viewing experience for consumers as games spread out across different services. Watching all of a team's games used to require an expensive cable bundle that included a regional sports network or, for displaced fans, a subscription to MLB.tv, baseball's out-of-market streaming package. That is no longer enough.</p><p>\"There is no issue more important to us than reach,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in an interview this week. \"From where I sit, because of the erosion of the cable model and RSNs being available on fewer cable systems, I think it is a positive to make games available on streaming platforms where viewers are currently moving.\"</p><p>RSNs charge cable-TV distributors fees that trickle down to consumers, an expense that varies based on how many teams play in a region. When all live sports paused in the beginning of the pandemic, cable-TV subscribers eventually received refunds for these fees.</p><p>In the streaming world, Apple and Peacock are small players compared with competitors like Netflix and Disney+. Despite the popularity of \"Ted Lasso,\" and the critical success of \"CODA,\" the film that just won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, Apple TV+ has an estimated 12 million paid subscribers in the U.S., according to MoffettNathanson. Peacock, which is also free to existing broadband and cable customers of Comcast and other providers, had over nine million paying customers and 24.5 million monthly active accounts at the end of 2021.</p><p>Sports is unlike anything else on television, however—43 of the 50 most-watched primetime telecasts in 2021 were live sports, including Games 5 and 6 of the World Series on Fox. MLB is betting that baseball is a big enough draw that people will shell out a few extra dollars a month to watch their team. Even better would be if young viewers who don't have cable but subscribe to the streaming services watch baseball now that it's available to them.</p><p>There is already precedent for this. American soccer supporters are accustomed to paying for many different services to see games: Peacock carries some Premier League games, Paramount+ has the Champions League, and ESPN+ shows, among others, Bundesliga and La Liga. National Hockey League fans are in a similar boat, as there are 75 exclusive games on ESPN+ and Hulu.</p><p>\"I believe that live sports content has a unique ability to attract people to platforms,\" Manfred said.</p><p>Some fans are unhappy about the new deals, given the exclusive nature of the games on Apple and Peacock, adding more costs. There is also the complaint that games shown outside of the local RSN hurts the viewing experience–mainly since the usual announcers are typically replaced with national broadcasters that lack the same familiarity with the team and intimacy with the audience.</p><p>\"In general, I think broadening the reach of the game is a good idea,\" said Maggie Wiggin, a 36-year-old Mets fan. \"But I think they are going about it in a very kind of haphazard manner that is actually probably going to achieve the opposite.\"</p><p>For RSNs, MLB's deals with Apple and Peacock are just the latest challenge. Cord-cutting has hurt these networks that were once considered engines of growth for media companies, due to the hefty fees they charge pay-TV operators to distribute the networks.</p><p>But that's not necessarily MLB's concern, as it begins to make plans for what could be a new paradigm for media consumption. League executives recognize the transition to streaming might be bumpy at first. Some fans, especially older ones, might be confused.</p><p>Ultimately, though, MLB foresees an end to the model dominated by cable TV. The league believes it is setting itself up for a future in which regional sports networks have less influence–and streaming services rule.</p><p>\"It is a well documented phenomenon that the reach of the RSNs is way down,\" Manfred said. \"So the idea of taking some games and putting them on new, different platforms so people can see them seems like a positive to me.\"</p><p>Christian Richey contributed to this report</p><p>Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com and Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com.</p><p>Want to Watch Every Mets Game?
