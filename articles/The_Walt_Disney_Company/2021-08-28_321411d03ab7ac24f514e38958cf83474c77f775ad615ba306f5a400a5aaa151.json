  "title": "These 15 stocks of retailers are expected to rise up to 97% over the next year",
  "text": "<p>Below are two lists of stocks of retailers, broadly defined by FactSet to include specialized companies such as Vroom Inc. VRM and Carvana Co. CVNA, which sell (and buy) used cars online. The first list includes 15 stocks that analysts expect to rise the most over the next year, and the second list shows companies expected to increase their sales the most over the next two years.</p><p>Two retailers that didn't make either list are Macy's Inc. M and Target Corp. TGT. Both are worth watching, although investors with shorter-term horizons may find them pricey.</p><p>Shares of Macy's had nearly doubled for 2021 through last week. The stock popped 20% on Aug. 19, after the company reported a 61% increase in comparable-store quarterly sales from a year earlier, established a quarterly dividend and announced an expanded partnership with WHP Global to sell more Toys ‘R' Us items in its stores. The stock closed at $22.39 on Aug. 20 — a penny above the consensus 12-month price target among analysts polled by FactSet. Of course, analysts can change their estimates in light of recent news.</p><p>Target's stock is up 49% this year. The company also reported a much-improved second quarter and expanded its partnership with Walt Disney Co. DIS. Target's shares closed at $253.40 on Aug. 20, 10% below the consensus price target of $277.66.</p><p>Analysts' favorite retail stocks</p><p>Starting with the Russell 3000 Index RUA, there are 124 stocks of companies in retail industries, according to FactSet's industry group descriptions. These include online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and the direct used-auto retailers mentioned above.</p><p>Among those stocks, 77 have stock-market values of at least $1 billion, are covered by at least five analysts polled by FactSet and have consensus sales and earnings estimates available through 2023.</p><p>Here are the 15 stocks with majority “buy” or equivalent ratings that the analysts believe have the most upside potential over the next year:</p><p> Company                                 Share “buy” ratings  Closing price – Aug. 20  Consensus price target  Implied 12-month upside potential  Vroom Inc.
