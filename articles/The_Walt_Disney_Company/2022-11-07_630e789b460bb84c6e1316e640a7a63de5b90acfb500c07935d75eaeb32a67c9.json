  "title": "Stocks Climb Ahead of Midterms, Inflation Data; Corporate earnings are due this week from Lyft, Walt Disney, Occidental Petroleum, Adidas and others",
  "text": "<p>Stocks finished last week with losses, with the S&amp;P 500 posting a weekly decline of more than 3% for the 10th time this year. The slide came after the Federal Reserve disappointed investors by signaling that officials might raise borrowing costs next year more than they had projected. Friday's jobs data, which showed that the labor market remains strong, further squelch some investors' hopes that the Fed might slow its pace of interest-rate hikes.</p><p>This week, traders are focused on Tuesday's midterm elections and Thursday's inflation data for October. The closely watched report is expected to show consumer prices increasing at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Corporate earnings are also due from such companies as Lyft—set to report after the market closes Monday—Walt Disney, Occidental Petroleum and Adidas.</p><p>Investors say they are watching for the possibility that Tuesday's election results could provide a boost to the stock market, especially if Republicans take the majority in the House of Representatives—a scenario that nonpartisan analysts are projecting. That would lead to a divided U.S. government, which some investors like because it reduces policy uncertainty.</p><p>This year, however, investors and strategists say any boost from the elections will likely be outweighed by interest-rate expectations, corporate results and economic data.</p><p>\"Market prices these days are a lot more governed by central bank expectations than by political expectations,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.</p><p>Mr. Ielpo said if inflation shows signs of cooling this week, markets could \"see a goldilocks period.\" Recently, his team has added exposure to stocks and bonds. About 50% of the firm's flagship multiasset portfolio is sitting in cash, down from 70% before the October stock-market rally.</p><p>Still, he noted, any forthcoming rally in the stock market is likely \"to be highly temporary\" and could ultimately reverse as the global economic outlook continues to sour.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged higher to 4.201%, from 4.157% Friday. Yields and bond prices move inversely. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to near-term interest-rate expectations, rose to 4.724%, from 4.652%.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 currencies, ticked down 0.2%, extending its declines after falling 1.7% Friday.</p><p>Oil markets fluctuated as traders digested Chinese officials' statement this weekend that they would stick to their zero-tolerance Covid-prevention strategy. Brent crude fell 0.3% to $98.26 a barrel. Chinese leaders are considering steps toward reopening after nearly three years of tough pandemic restrictions but are proceeding slowly and have set no timeline, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2%. In Asia, indexes finished higher even after China's exports to the rest of the world shrank unexpectedly in October. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.7%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Climb Ahead of Midterms, Inflation Data</p>",
