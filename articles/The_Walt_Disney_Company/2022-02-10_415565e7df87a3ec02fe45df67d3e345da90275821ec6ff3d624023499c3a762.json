  "title": "Stocks Drop, Bond Yields Rise After Inflation Data; Inflation accelerated to 7.5% annual rate in January; 10-year Treasury yield rises above 2%",
  "text": "<p>The moves followed new pricing data, showing inflation accelerated further to a 7.5% annual rate in January, topping economists' forecasts and December's 7% pace. Bond yields, meanwhile, rose to 2.018% from 1.928% Wednesday, going above 2%for the first time since 2019. The yield on two-year notes, which are particularly sensitive to interest rates, rose to 1.493% from 1.346%.</p><p>The data injected fresh uncertainty into a market that had shown some signs of stabilizing: the S&amp;P 500 had risen seven of the past 10 trading days. Money managers say they are bracing for more volatility as investors assess the likelihood of whether the Federal Reserve will have to act more aggressively to tame inflation.</p><p>\"Speculation regarding the outcome of the next [Fed meeting] will now run rife,\" said Sandra Holdsworth, head of rates UK at Aegon Asset Management. \"With inflation at these levels and still not expected to have peaked, it's hard to argue whether 25 basis points, 50 basis points or even more is the right response from the central bank.\"</p><p>Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager of the InfraCap Equity Income ETF, said he expects the Fed to enact four rate hikes throughout the year along with a modest reduction in the central bank's balance sheet. He believes inflation won't start to moderate until the second half of the year.</p><p>\"We believe that the stock market will stabilize once the 10-year treasury finds a bottom, Mr. Hatfield said, adding that he believes a stable level could be found at around 2%, where yields traded on Thursday.</p><p>For now, stocks largely slid again.</p><p>Shares of fast-growing companies were hit hardest. Tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.1%, with software, IT services and semiconductor companies all mostly falling. Qualcomm, Advanced Micro Devices and Adobe fell more than 3.6% each, while Apple shed 1.7%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter shares were down 0.1% after the social-media company said it had largely dodged the effect of privacy changes hurting Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Uber Technologies slipped 4.5% after the ride-hailing firm said quarterly revenue climbed 83%.</p><p>Other laggards included PepsiCo, which fell 1.8% after raising its dividend and setting a $10 billion stock buyback program. Most other sectors of the stock market also fell, with the exception of material stocks, which were up 0.3%.</p><p>Among the few other bright spots, Walt Disney added 3.1% after it reported 11.8 million new subscribers for its Disney+ streaming service in the fourth quarter. Twilio added 5.1% after the software company said revenue and profits topped analysts' forecasts. Mattel also topped forecasts, sending shares of the toy maker 7.7% higher.</p><p>Overseas, stock markets were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite ticked up 0.2%. In Hong Kong, China Evergrande shares rose 5.4% after reports that the embattled property company plans to restore construction and sales activity, while refraining from a fire sale of its assets.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Drop, Bond Yields Rise After Inflation Data</p>",
