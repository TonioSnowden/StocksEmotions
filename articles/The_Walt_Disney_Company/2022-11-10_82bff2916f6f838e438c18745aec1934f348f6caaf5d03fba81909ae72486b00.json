  "title": "Business News:  Disney Shares Take Steep Fall  As Streaming Loss Accelerates  ----  By Will Feuer",
  "text": "<p>   Shares of Walt Disney Co. fell 13% after quarterly losses at the company's streaming business more than doubled from a year earlier and executives vowed to pare back spending in the division. </p><p>   The entertainment conglomerate on Tuesday also reported a drop in its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue at its traditional media business, partially offsetting 36% revenue growth in the theme-parks division. </p><p>   By the Wednesday market close, Disney's stock dropped just over 13% to $86.75, its largest one-day percentage slide since September 2001. The most recent decline trimmed more than $20 billion off Disney's market value and represented the company's lowest close since March 2020. </p><p>   The stock was the biggest loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, erasing about 87 points from the index. </p><p>   The company's flagship streaming service, Disney+, added 12.1 million net new accounts, beating analysts' predictions and bringing its global total to 164.2 million subscribers. But losses in the division surged to $1.47 billion, 38% wider than what Wall Street expected. </p><p>   Chief Executive Bob Chapek said Tuesday that the streaming business had reached peak losses in the quarter, and that the business is still on track to reach profitability in fiscal 2024, \"assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chapek said price increases to some Disney+ packages and a new ad-supported subscription tier for Disney+ that are both set to take effect Dec. 8 will help stem losses in the business. However, some on Wall Street aren't as optimistic about the impending moves. </p><p>   Analysts at Barclays said the higher price tag on Disney+ and the rollout of an ad-supported tier at the same price as the current ad-free option will likely push some subscribers to drop the service. The analysts said Disney's goal of achieving streaming profitability in 2024 may be at odds with its stated target of reaching 215 million to 245 million streaming subscribers by the end of the same fiscal year. </p><p>   \"We believe Disney may face a choice between its subscriber growth guidance and its streaming break-even guidance as we believe it may be tough to meet both,\" the analysts wrote. </p><p>   The Barclays analysts added that Disney's linear television business is likely to weaken amid a worsening advertising market and accelerating subscriber losses. Barton Crockett, senior internet media analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said Disney's linear business is facing the same headwinds as peers and will likely see greater pressures in the year ahead. </p><p>   MoffettNathanson analysts zeroed in on Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy's guidance that the company expects fiscal 2023 segment operating-income growth of a high single-digit percentage. The analysts had expected to see 34% growth. </p><p>   \"Rarely have we ever been so incorrect in our forecasting of Disney profits,\" they said, adding that rapid deterioration in the linear TV business appears to be closer than previously thought. </p><p>   The collision of macroeconomic uncertainty with a broad shift within the streaming sector toward giving priority to profitability is testing investors' patience, analysts at Credit Suisse said. They added that proving the pricing power of Disney+ will be crucial to remaining on the company's current growth trajectory. </p><p>   The parks division, a critical source of strength for the quarter, also has its challenges, analysts said. JPMorgan analysts said higher costs and soft demand in Asia weighed on operating income for the segment. </p><p>   \"Clearly the revenue post-Covid came back before costs,\" the analysts said, adding that their expectations for the segment's profit margins were too high for the year ahead. </p><p></p>",
