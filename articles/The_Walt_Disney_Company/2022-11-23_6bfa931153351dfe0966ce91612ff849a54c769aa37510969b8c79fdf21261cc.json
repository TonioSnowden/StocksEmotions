  "text": "<p>The last seven superhero films produced by Marvel Studios, Disney's most-profitable film studio over the past decade, haven't received release dates in the crucial China market, denting the global box-office gross.</p><p>In July, for example, Disney cited the lack of a China release for \"Thor: Love and Thunder,\" the fourth solo film featuring Chris Hemsworth's Thor character from the popular Avengers superhero team, as one reason the movie underperformed at the box office.</p><p>While Disney hasn't revealed the movie's budget, Mr. Cameron, the director, said in a recent interview in GQ magazine that the \"Avatar\" sequel was \"the worst business case in movie history\" and that it would have to be the third- or fourth-highest-grossing film in history just to break even. Disney has said that it plans to make five Avatar movies in total.</p><p>\"This is fantastic news for Disney, for James Cameron and for the movie, because the potential box office from China is enormous,\" Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst, said in an interview. \"This may be the pivotal moment that indicates that 'Way of Water' will earn enough money to justify further installments of the Avatar franchise.\"</p><p>The first Avatar movie from 2009 grossed nearly $2.9 billion worldwide, with $259 million of that total coming from China, making it the highest-grossing movie of all time. It narrowly edged out Marvel's \"Avengers: Endgame\" after a September 2022 rerelease of the movie added $73 million in ticket sales, according to Comscore, a box-office tracker.</p><p>It sparked a boom in multiplex construction in China, as Chinese audiences flocked to see the film in 3-D.</p><p>Updates to follow as news develops.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney's 'Avatar: The Way of Water' Cleared for December Release in China</p>",
