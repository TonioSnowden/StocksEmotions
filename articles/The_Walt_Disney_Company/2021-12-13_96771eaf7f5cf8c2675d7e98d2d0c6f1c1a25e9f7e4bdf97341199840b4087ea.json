  "title": "In 'West Side Story,' A Call on Subtitles",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Spielberg said the choice was intentional. Using subtitles would be \"very disrespectful\" to Spanish-speakers, he said, because it would have signaled that they weren't the intended audience. Lines in Spanish are loosely dispersed, and designed to be \"understood emotionally for those who don't understand a single word of Spanish,\" the director said during a panel discussion last week. If that forces non-Spanish speakers to listen closer to keep up, that's part of the point.</p><p>\"West Side Story\" is a high-profile example of filmmakers' efforts to speak directly to the people their stories are about. Songs in Disney's animated musical \"Encanto\" unfold in Spanish without translation. The FX series \"Reservation Dogs\" drops in Native American slang and cultural references without explanation.</p><p>It would have been unheard of a decade ago for a major release to forgo translations, for fear of alienating potential ticket buyers. \"West Side Story\" shows a shift in Hollywood's thinking about audiences, especially as viewers gravitate to more non-English options.</p><p>The smash-hit 1961 film \"West Side Story\" didn't use subtitles either, but the Spanish words were sporadic, including typical Hollywood seasonings such as \"muchachos\" and \"vamonos.\"</p><p>The new movie's more-expansive Spanish lines up with box-office demographics. Hispanic people have long had a higher per capita attendance rate at U.S. movie theaters than other ethnicities, according to the Motion Picture Association. In 2020, Hispanics represented about 19% of the U.S. population, but accounted for 29% of movie tickets sold. Whites bought 49% of movie tickets, down from 54% in 2019.</p><p>\"If 'West Side Story' is trying to market to the population that purchases more than 25% of all film tickets, then they made a good decision,\" says Brenda Castillo, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition. \"By not using subtitles, the movie incorporates what this country is really like. It's bilingual and sometimes multilingual.\"</p><p>The choices made by Mr. Spielberg, writer Tony Kushner and their team carry added weight because of the musical's huge influence and its mixed legacy on race. The original 1957 Broadway show (by director and choreographer Jerome Robbins, composer Leonard Bernstein, lyricist Stephen Sondheim and playwright Arthur Laurents) broke ground by putting Latino characters at the center of a reinterpretation of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" But the 1961 movie has been criticized for casting white actors wearing brown makeup to play Puerto Ricans.</p><p>Mr. Kushner, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer behind Mr. Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" and \"Munich,\" recruited a friend from the theater world, Julio Monge, to collaborate on the translation.</p><p>Mr. Monge describes the filmmakers' decision to forgo subtitles as a pleasant surprise, one that challenged the team to choose authentic phrases that could still be universally deciphered. For example, Bernardo (David Alvarez) uses \"bien linda\" to remark how beautiful Maria looks in her white dress for a dance.</p><p>In the scenes where Spanish stands on its own, Mr. Monge says, \"It shouldn't feel foreign. It should feel logical.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
