  "text": "<p>Noah took over hosting the satirical news show from Jon Stewart in 2015.</p><p>He hosted the show from his apartment for more than a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before returning to the studio last year. During Noah's tenure, \"The Daily Show\" shifted its focus, from snarky mocking of conservatives under Stewart to a more youth-focused, social-advocacy messages (though conservatives were still regularly mocked).</p><p>Noah did not give a departure date, and said he will continue hosting the show for the \"time being.\"</p><p>\"We are grateful to Trevor for our amazing partnership over the past seven years,\" Paramount Global's PARA Comedy Central said in a statement Thursday night. \"With no timetable for his departure, we're working together on next steps. As we look ahead, we're excited for the next chapter in the 25+ year history of The Daily Show as it continues to redefine culture through sharp and hilarious social commentary, helping audiences make sense of the world around them.\"</p><p>\"The Daily Show\" has been Emmy-nominated for \"outstanding variety talk series\" every year Noah has hosted, but has never won, losing to former \"Daily Show\" cast member John Oliver's \"Last Week Tonight\" on HBO each year, though it did win an Emmy for \"best short-form variety show\" in 2018.</p><p>Noah's departure is the latest shakeup in the late-night TV scene. Warner Bros. Discovery's WBD TBS recently canceled Samantha Bee's \"Full Frontal\" after seven seasons. Showtime's\"Desus &amp; Mero\" recently split up, and James Corden has announced he's leaving CBS's \"The Late Late Show\" in 2023.</p><p>Last week, Disney's DIS ABC renewed \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" for three more years.</p><p>Trevor Noah leaving 'The Daily Show' after 7 years</p>",
