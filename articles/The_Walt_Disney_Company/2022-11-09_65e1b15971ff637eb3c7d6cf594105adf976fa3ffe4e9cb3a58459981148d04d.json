  "title": "Dow Falls More Than 600 Points as Crypto Selloff, Midterm Results Loom; Investors are on alert for possible cryptocurrency contagion as a selloff picked up steam after the FTX deal fell apart",
  "text": "<p>Investors remain eager to see if the elections result in a divided U.S. government, an outcome that would suggest few major policy changes in the next two years. That is typically seen as a boon for the stock market.</p><p>Although investors' expectations of a gridlocked government appear intact, results thus far suggest Republicans might not have gained as much ground as anticipated. That likely pressured markets Wednesday, traders said.</p><p>\"Markets don't enjoy surprises, preferring predictability. This did not transpire to be the route expected,\" said Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at investment adviser Moneta.</p><p>Several key races are still undecided. Republicans remain favored to take the House majority, but the makeup of the Senate remains a tossup. Some races might take days to be called.</p><p>While the major stock indexes were under pressure all day, the selloff accelerated into the closing bell as a shake-up in the crypto world weighed on investor sentiment broadly.</p><p>A deal by crypto exchange Binance to save rival FTX crumbled in the final hour of the session, sending shock waves across more growth-oriented areas of the market. Just a day earlier, FTX succumbed to a sudden liquidity crunch and agreed to be taken over by Binance. But by Wednesday afternoon, Binance saidit would walk away from the deal because FTX's \"issues are beyond our control or ability to help.\"</p><p>The FTX news \"could certainly be impacting risk appetite\" among investors, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. \"It keeps investors on edge of what else could be lurking out there\" as the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening testsliquidity across financial markets.</p><p>Bitcoin fell to its lowest level since November 2020, dropping to $15,787.53 by 5 p.m. ET, roughly 16% lower than 24 hours before. Ethereum sank 17%. Meanwhile, FTX's FTT token continued its sharp tumble, losing roughly 58% in the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data show.</p><p>Stocks with ties to cryptocurrencies also slid. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global fell $4.85, or 9.5%, to $45.98. Robinhood Markets, in which FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried unveiled a roughly $648 million investment earlier this year, declined $1.34, or 14%, to $8.40. MicroStrategy and Silvergate Capital each tumbled double-digit percentage points.</p><p>In general, history shows stocks tend to advance after midterms. The S&amp;P 500 hasrisen in the trading session following Election Day roughly three-quarters of the time since 1930, with an average gain of 0.4%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The broad benchmark has moved higher in the one-year period following every midterm election since 1942.</p><p>Even so, many still say their focus is largely elsewhere this year as the Fed raises interest rates at an aggressive pace in an effort to tamp down persistent inflation.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, it's still all about the Fed,\" said Leslie Thompson, chief investment officer at Spectrum Wealth Management. Ms. Thompson said her firm is positioned defensively and holding more cash than usual while it monitors the Fed's monetary-policy trajectory.</p><p>Thursday will bring new inflation data from October, which is expected to factor heavily into the Fed's next interest-rate decision. Economists expect that consumer prices rose 7.9% on an annual basis, down from 8.2% the previous month. </p><p>Investors are roughly split on their expectations for the outcome of the central bank's December meeting. Federal-fund futures, used by traders to wager on the trajectory of interest rates, on Wednesday showed a 57% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a smaller 0.5 percentage point, versus a 43% chance that it will lift rates by 0.75 percentage point for a fifth time in a row.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged slightly higher to 4.149%, from 4.125% Tuesday. Meanwhile, another closely watched recession indicator, the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and the 10-year note, remained inverted. Fed researchers have said this metric has the best record of front-running an economic downturn.</p><p>Elsewhere, Meta Platforms jumped $5, or 5.2%, to $101.47 after the company said it would cut more than 11,000 workers, or 13% of its staff. Walt Disney shares dropped $13.15, or 13%, to $86.75 after reportingweaker-than-expected quarterly results, the biggest drag on the Dow industrials.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, slid 2.8% to $92.65 a barrel, extending its losses into a third day. Energy stocks were the worst-performing sector of the S&amp;P 500, down 4.9%.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.3%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2%, China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.5% and Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.6%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Hannah Miao at hannah.miao@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Falls More Than 600 Points as Crypto Selloff, Midterm Results Loom</p>",
