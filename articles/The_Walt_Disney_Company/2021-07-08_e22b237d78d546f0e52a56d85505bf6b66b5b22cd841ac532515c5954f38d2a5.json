  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  Travel & Entertainment -- What to Stream:  'Monsters' Reign in a New Show  ----  By Chris Kornelis",
  "text": "<p>\n  Among the monsters appearing on screen this week are fuzzy, friendly ones who try to make children laugh. Here's how to stream them -- as well as a comfy romantic drama. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New Release: 'Monsters at Work' </p><p>\n  (Disney+) </p><p>\n  In 2001's \"Monsters, Inc.,\" Sulley (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal), a pair of monsters who work for a company that mines energy from the screams of children, embark on a journey that ends with the discovery that they can get more power from laughs than shrieks. </p><p>\n   \"Monsters at Work,\" a new series from Disney Television Animation that premieres July 7 on Disney+, picks up right where \"Monsters, Inc\" left off. (It follows a 2013 prequel called \"Monsters University.\") </p><p>\n  Mike and Sulley have been put in charge of the company that has to pivot from making children scared to making them laugh. A new hire, schooled in the old ways, is Tylor Tuskmon, who discovers that his way of doing business no longer exists. </p><p>\n  Messrs. Goodman and Crystal return to their familiar roles, while Tylor, the central character, is voiced by Ben Feldman, best known for his role as Jonah Simms on the NBC sitcom \"Superstore.\" Mr. Feldman says voice-acting is as foreign to him as chuckle power is to the \"Monsters\" characters trained in the art of the fright. </p><p>\n  \"I don't know what I'm doing,\" he says. \"I just come in and I'm neurotic and I stutter my way through a recording session and I pray that that's what they're looking for.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New Release: 'Virgin River' </p><p>\n  (Netflix) </p><p>\n  \"Virgin River,\" a Netflix drama based on a series of romance novels by Robyn Carr, has a premise that is familiar to anyone who watches the Hallmark Channel during the holiday season. A woman from the big city moves to the woods to find happiness in the wholesomeness of small-town America. There, she finds community and love in the arms of a veteran. </p><p>\n  In this series, created by a Hallmark vet, the woman is Alexandra Breckenridge's Mel Monroe, a nurse practitioner and midwife who finds Virgin River after a life in Los Angeles. Her love interest is Martin Henderson's Jack Sheridan, a former Marine struggling with PTSD who owns the local gathering spot called Jack's Bar. The third season premieres Friday. </p><p>\n  Like the Hallmark fare that honed the genre, it's been wildly popular. More than 3 billion minutes of the series's 20 episodes were streamed in the first 10 days after the release of its second season, according to Nielsen, and it was the most-streamed program in its first full week of release on Nielsen's list of most-streamed titles. </p><p>\n  Creator Sue Tenney, who was the showrunner on the Hallmark series \"Cedar Cove\" and \"Good Witch\" doesn't shy away from the comparisons, but notes the differences. </p><p>\n  \"There's darker parts to our show that would never fit onto Hallmark,\" she says. \"I respect all audiences for what they want to watch and what they like.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Streaming Notes </p><p>\n  Superman: Director Richard Donner, who died this week at the age of 91, was responsible for blockbuster, iconic and cult films throughout his career. </p><p>\n  Some of his films are streaming on HBO Max. They include 1978's \"Superman,\" 1985's \"The Goonies,\" and all four \"Lethal Weapon\" movies. </p><p></p>",
