  "title": "Shanghai Has Reopened, but Not Disneyland; The theme park remains closed as businesses deal with the possibility of abrupt Covid-related lockdowns",
  "text": "<p>Shanghai Disneyland was shut on March 21 as municipal authorities tried to contain the then-fast-spreading outbreak, and the amusement park hasn't reopened following the lifting of some citywide restrictions, which began on June 1.</p><p>The park has yet to reopen in part because some executives fear a single infection among park guests could mean a disruptive shutdown, according to people familiar with the matter. Last October, Shanghai Disneyland was forced to suspend operations, locking 30,000 visitors inside the park, after a guest tested positive for Covid-19.</p><p>A Shanghai Disney Resort spokeswoman declined to comment on when the amusement park would reopen. \"Like many businesses, we have had continuous conversations with the Shanghai municipal government about the responsible reopening of the resort,\" Shanghai Disney Resort said in a statement. Some shopping and dining venues within the resort have reopened.</p><p>Additional reasons for keeping the amusement park closed, the people said, include the extra costs associated with mass Covid testing and the expectation of fewer summer visitors because of pandemic fears. Other theme parks in Shanghai and Beijing have restarted, including Universal Beijing Resorts, partly owned by Comcast Corp.</p><p>Shanghai Disneyland was built at a cost of $5.5 billion, and is 57%-owned by a state-backed consortium, Shanghai Shendi Group Co., and 43% by Walt Disney Co. The Shanghai government didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In Shanghai and across China, thousands more businesses are wrestling with similar Covid-related challenges, raising concerns among economists of a vicious cycle—the prospect that one or two infections by a variant of the coronavirus could lead to disruptive shutdowns, suppressing business investment and consumer spending. Less investment means fewer jobs created, which in turn hits spending and investment.</p><p>That spiral risks undermining Beijing's efforts to salvage the economy from a bruising two-month lockdown in Shanghai, a continuing property slump and global supply-chain shudders from the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"The longer the strict pandemic policy lasts, the weaker business sentiment will turn,\" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at investment bank Nomura, who recently lowered his Chinese growth forecast this year to 3.3% from 3.9%—below China's official target of roughly 5.5% expansion.</p><p>The government's aggressive testing plan raises the possibility of further lockdowns, even after Shanghai's top official, Communist Party chief Li Qiang, declared on Saturday that the city had \"won the battle\" against the latest outbreak.</p><p>Shanghai health authorities have ordered the city's 25 million people to undergo mass Covid testing each weekend until the end of July amid rising caseloads. Some residential compounds have been sealed off again for weeks, just days after they were reopened from months of lockdown.</p><p>After stamping out an initial wave in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in early 2020, China was able to keep Covid-19 largely outside its borders for two years by severely limiting inbound travel and immediately confining newly infected patients to quarantine.</p><p>But the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus has scrambled the calculus for Beijing, testing its ability to stick to its \"zero-Covid\" policy. Mr. Xi has publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the policy, although economists expect the pain of the Shanghai lockdown to push second-quarter economic growth to near-zero levels.</p><p>Beijing has said its strict approach to handling the coronavirus, in contrast to the West, demonstrates the priority that the Communist Party has placed on protecting lives. Proving the policy's effectiveness has become a key source of legitimacy in a year in which Mr. Xi is expected to break with recent precedent and seek a third term in power.</p><p>In Shanghai's Pudong district, where many Covid restrictions remain in place three months after the lockdowns began, one entrepreneur surnamed Wang said the executive coaching company he founded 16 years ago suffered a plunge in demand after the city was locked down in the spring. Mr. Wang expects company revenue this year to drop by at least a third from last year.</p><p>Mr. Wang worries that recurring lockdowns will force more multinational corporations, which account for roughly 70% of his clientele, to relocate in the coming months. He has frozen hiring and shelved plans for new investments, like developing a mobile app.</p><p>\"Our first priority this year is survival,\" said Mr. Wang, who was released from home confinement in Shanghai on June 1—only to be quarantined again five days later when a resident of his compound tested positive.</p><p>For analysts like Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, the bigger concern is whether the recurring Covid lockdowns lead to \"permanent scarring,\" with prolonged periods of elevated joblessness among service-sector workers.</p><p>Another risk is that foreign businesses, already facing rising geopolitical pressure in China, reassess their commitment to the country. Nearly one-fourth of businesses surveyed by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China between February and April said they were reconsidering investment in the country as a result of Covid restrictions, according to a report released last week—more than double the rate a year ago.</p><p>\"This lack of predictability is causing companies to worry who's going to be the next,\" said Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce and a regular interlocutor with senior Chinese leaders. \"The assumption is that this can go way into 2023.\"</p><p>For now, costs for many companies are rising as they set up new Covid-testing facilities and stockpile more inventory. Manufacturers are storing a few months' worth of parts and supplies, in case future Covid lockdowns disrupt supply chains, said Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.</p><p>\"Companies are moving from a 'just in time' model to a 'just in case' one,\" Mr. Zheng said.</p><p>One small-business owner, Song Yi, runs a four-year-old startup that employs 10 people. While his business selling tea products fared well throughout the pandemic, revenue began plunging in April when lockdowns brought business to a halt. To reduce costs, Mr. Song cut back spending on research and development.</p><p>\"If the lockdown comes back for another two to three times, we may not survive,\" said Mr. Song, 23.</p><p>Lingling Wei contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stella Yifan Xie at stella.xie@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com</p><p>Shanghai Has Reopened, but Not Disneyland</p>",
