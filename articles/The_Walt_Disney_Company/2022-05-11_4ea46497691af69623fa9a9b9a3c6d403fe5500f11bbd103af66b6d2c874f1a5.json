  "text": "<p>The penis is a humdrum sight on German opera stages. But Christophe Honoré's new production of Berlioz's <em>Les Troyens</em> in Munich might just have set a record for the most gratuitous display of the male member in recent operatic history. Dido is queen not of Carthage, but of a gay nudist pool party; in place of Berlioz's ballets, Honoré has two big screens brought on to the stage; these show cringe-makingly pretentious gay porn movies that have, with the best will in the world, absolutely nothing to do with <em>Les Troyens</em>.</p> <p>In the videos, in a setting of sun-drenched concrete and evident poverty, beautiful boys form writhing piles atop one another. At the beginning there are maggots, at the end there are gouts of blood, which the copulating groups smear sleepily over themselves and each other. Why?</p> <p>In the programme, Honoré claims that his “decision” not to tell the actual story has profound philosophical grounds. He is as unable to articulate them as he is to stage this opera. Five hours is a dreadfully long time to spend watching singers stranded on the stage, occasionally tripping over the set, singing helplessly at the conductor. Bavarian State Opera has a lavishly funded army of responsible administrators. Why did none of them intervene? How could this happen?</p> <p>Katrin Lea Tag's set is one of the least awful aspects of the opera (a co-production with Opera Australia, Brisbane, poor things). The first act shows a Troy of broken concrete slabs, the sea a giant advertising placard in the background. Honoré has decided that the role of the chorus makes no sense in this opera (why?), and so has them stroll about the stage in modern concert dress. Olivier Bériot, a Netflix designer clearly relishing a limitless opera budget, costumes the principals in outrageous robes. Think <em>Star Wars</em> crossed with teenage vampire movie. Why?</p> <p>Neither in the gothic gloom of Troy nor in the gay fantasies of Carthage does Honoré succeed in telling any kind of story. No doubt he will chalk up the hurricane of boos that greeted him at curtain call to homophobia. But he could have put all the gay sex he wanted on to the stage and succeeded if only he had shown a coherent idea. Just one.</p> <p>Nor can conductor Daniele Rustioni save the day. Too often he seems to see his role as one of merely beating time and keeping things together. Berlioz's glorious score needs shape and nuance, drive and delicacy; instead we get mostly bombast.</p> <p>No wonder the singers struggle. Marie-Nicole Lemieux does her best as the frantic Cassandre; Ekaterina Semenchuk, jumping in at short notice to take over the mammoth part of Didon, copes impressively. Only Gregory Kunde, as Enée, really rises above all the nonsense. His big final aria stirs the audience to spontaneous shouts of approbation, and his performance in the glorious love duet is one of this excruciating evening's few moments of actual beauty.</p> <p>★☆☆☆☆</p> <p><em>To July 10, </em><a href=\"https://www.staatsoper.de/en/\"><em>staatsoper.de</em></a></p><p>Source: Shirley Apthorp 2022 'Les Troyens, Munich review — desperately mediocre evening of blood and porn' FT.com 11 May.
