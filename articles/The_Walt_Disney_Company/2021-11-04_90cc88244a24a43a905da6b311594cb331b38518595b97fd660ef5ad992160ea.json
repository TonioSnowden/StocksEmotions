  "title": "Biden's Vaccine Mandate Means Millions of Workers Must Get Shots by Jan. 4 or Test Weekly; While requirements are described as necessary to curb pandemic, they have drawn opposition from many Republicans",
  "text": "<p>Companies subject to the rules must ensure that employees who aren't vaccinated against Covid-19 produce a negative test at least weekly and wear a mask in the workplace. Employers aren't required under the new policy to provide or pay for tests, with potential exceptions if collective bargaining agreements compel them to do so.</p><p>Employers who don't adhere to the requirements could face penalties of up to around $13,600 per violation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration typically responds when it receives a complaint, but it will also check on compliance through some planned inspections, senior administration officials said.</p><p>The administration said the requirements don't apply to employees who don't report to a workplace where other individuals are present, employees who only work from home, or employees who work exclusively outdoors.</p><p>Mr. Biden has said he was reluctant to issue vaccination requirements and did so after a monthslong campaign encouraging people to get the shot failed to persuade many Americans.</p><p>\"While I would have much preferred that requirements not become necessary, too many people remain unvaccinated for us to get out of this pandemic for good,\" Mr. Biden said Thursday, adding that vaccination requirements are \"nothing new.\"</p><p>\"We've been living with them throughout our lives for all sorts of diseases,\" he said.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 46 million cases in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The OSHA emergency temporary standard can stay in place for six months before it would need to be codified as a permanent standard that requires rule making.</p><p>Brian Fielkow, CEO of Houston trucking and logistics firm Jetco Delivery, said he supports efforts to get more Americans vaccinated but expects complying could be complicated for some employers. His company has a supply of rapid tests on hand because other testing options may not be feasible for some workers.</p><p>\"Like any regulation, we'll comply, but this one I think is especially troublesome for employers at the smaller end of that spectrum,\" he said.</p><p>TJ Kennedy, CEO of Qumu Corp., a Minneapolis provider of video technology that employs about 125 people, said his company adopted a \"work-from-wherever\" policy during the pandemic. People who travel for work or meet with colleagues or customers must get vaccinated or test for Covid-19.</p><p>\"Having federal government guidance on major public health initiatives, regardless of what they may be, does help employers have continuity across the workplace,\" Mr. Kennedy said.</p><p>Republican opposition to the policy has intensified since September, when OSHA said it would issue an emergency temporary standard implementing the new requirements.</p><p>Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich in September filed a lawsuit against Mr. Biden's Covid-19 requirements for businesses and a set of rules for federal contractors. Many other states have also sought to challenge the administration's mandate for federal contractors.</p><p>\"Under our Constitution, the President isn't a king who can exercise this sort of unbridled power unilaterally,\" Mr. Brnovich said in his legal brief.</p><p>Sens. James Lankford (R., Okla.) and Mike Braun (R., Ind.) and a group of Republican colleagues issued a statement Wednesday saying they disapprove of the vaccine requirement for employers. They plan to use the Congressional Review Act to compel lawmakers to vote on a resolution opposing the requirement for a vaccination or testing program.</p><p>\"This unacceptable federal directive impacts tens of millions of Americans and warrants review by Congress, the representatives elected by the American people to make the laws,\" the lawmakers said.</p><p>Employers subject to the new rules must require each vaccinated worker to provide proof of vaccination status, federal officials said. Acceptable documents include a record of immunization from a provider or pharmacy; a copy of a CDC Covid-19 vaccination card; medical records; immunization records from public health, state or tribal immunization information system; or a copy of other official documentation that contains the type and dates of vaccination.</p><p>When documentation can't be obtained, a signed and dated statement from the employee attesting to his or her vaccination status is permitted.</p><p>The OSHA rules require those employers to provide paid time off to workers so they can receive the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as sick leave to recover from any side effects, and to ensure that unvaccinated employees wear a face mask while in the workplace by Dec. 5.</p><p>OSHA fines are determined by whether there are willful violations and how often violations occur, and employers must keep records showing compliance. There is a standard penalty of up to $13,653 for a single violation, such as failure to provide paid leave or not having a vaccination program, rather than levying that fine per employee out of compliance.</p><p>Multiple fines are possible if there are numerous violations, senior administration officials said. Willful violations can lead to a maximum penalty of $136,532 per violation.</p><p>States that operate their own Occupational Safety and Health Plans are required to adopt standards at least as effective as the federal OSHA requirement.</p><p>One aim of the new rules was to give employers cover to issue vaccine requirements since some were concerned that workers in a tight labor market might quit and go to other companies without an industry standard, two people familiar with the planning said.</p><p>Many large businesses, including Walt Disney Co. and meatpacker Tyson Foods Inc., hospital groups, and colleges and universities, have already implemented Covid-19 vaccine requirements. The Biden administration has also made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory for all federal employees and contractors, as well as U.S. service members.</p><p>The administration on Monday released guidance on the mandate for federal contractors, which has been a factor for many large companies imposing vaccination requirements.</p><p>The administration also said that staff at all health facilities that get Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements will have to be vaccinated, following up on emergency vaccination requirements announced in September. Both health workers and federal contractors will have until Jan. 4 to get either their second dose of the vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE or Moderna Inc., or a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>Inspectors will review whether hospitals are in compliance as part of their routine survey process, which can ultimately lead to civil monetary penalties for violators and termination from the two federal programs.</p><p>Health workers with medical conditions or religious reasons not to get vaccinated can seek an exemption, but there isn't an option for testing in lieu of vaccination.</p><p>The Biden administration has discussed the pending vaccine requirements with trade groups in recent weeks, including the Associated Builders and Contractors.</p><p>About 80% of the U.S. adult population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the CDC. About 70% of adults are fully vaccinated.</p><p>Slightly under 40% of workers who are unvaccinated said they would leave their job if getting the Covid-19 vaccine was mandated by their employer or if they were required to be tested for the virus weekly, according to survey results from the Kaiser Family Foundation Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor.</p><p>Chip Cutter contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Sabrina Siddiqui at Sabrina.Siddiqui@wsj.com</p><p>Biden's Vaccine Mandate Means Millions of Workers Must Get Shots by Jan. 4 or Test Weekly</p>",
