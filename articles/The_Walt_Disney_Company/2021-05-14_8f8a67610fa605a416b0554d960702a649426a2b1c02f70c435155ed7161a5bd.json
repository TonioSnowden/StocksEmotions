  "title": "Disney+  Adds  Fewer  Users  ----  By Erich Schwartzel and Allison Prang",
  "text": "<p>   LOS ANGELES -- The streaming boom that defined Hollywood during Covid-19 is slowing down for now. </p><p>   Weeks after Netflix Inc. announced its subscriber sign-ups had slowed amid a reopening economy, Walt Disney Co. said its flagship streaming service, Disney+, also added fewer users than Wall Street had expected after months of torrential growth. </p><p>   Disney+ added 8.7 million subscribers in the fiscal second quarter, bringing its quarter-end total to 103.6 million subscribers, compared with 94.9 million on Jan. 2. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 109.3 million subscribers after a quarter that saw massive hits on the service from the company's Marvel Studios. </p><p>   Disney shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trading. </p><p>   The winners of the Covid-19 economy aren't the same as those who win in the reopening, and this quarter found Disney in a messy middle. The end of lockdowns and mask mandates, while good news for Disney's lucrative parks division and studio releases, presents fresh headwinds for an 18-month-old streaming operation that has lifted shares to record highs and given the company some of its biggest hits in recent years, from Baby Yoda to \"WandaVision.\" </p><p>   More than a year of quarantines and stay-at-home orders accelerated an industrywide shift toward direct-to-consumer services that made subscriber growth -- and not box-office sales -- the leading metric of studios' success. </p><p>   Nowhere was that more pronounced than at Disney, where the streaming service passed the 100-million-subscriber mark in March, cementing its status as the most successful streaming entrant since Netflix defined the field years ago. </p><p>   That growth had been a lifesaver for Disney shares, which plummeted to their lowest point since 2014 when the pandemic hit in March 2020 but had rebounded to record highs a year later. Shares have been on a slight downward trend since, hovering around $180. </p><p>   Disney has taken steps to boost its streaming revenue, increasing subscription costs by $1 to $7.99 a month in late March. The company said the price hike didn't result in any significant user cancellations. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Disney's parks, experiences and products business -- which includes its storied Disney World and Disneyland resorts -- saw a 44% drop in revenue compared with a year earlier. That division reported an operating loss of $406 million in a quarter that saw parks either closed or open with capacity limits. </p><p>   Overall, Disney's total revenue fell 13% from the comparable 2020 period to $15.61 billion. According to FactSet, analysts were expecting $15.86 billion. </p><p>   Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said he expects to see \"an immediate increase\" in the number of people allowed inside the domestic parks in light of Thursday's announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that fully vaccinated people can meet indoors and outside without wearing a mask. </p><p>   \"Today's guidance,\" he said, \"is very big news for us, particularly if anyone has been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on.\" </p><p></p>",
