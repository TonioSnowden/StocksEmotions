  "text": "<p>Hollywood has reasons to be optimistic. Last month, box office revenues in North America hit a pandemic-era high of $637m, equivalent to one-fifth of total 2021 sales. It was the first time October was the highest grossing month of the year and reflects growing confidence among movie fans about going back to the cinema.</p> <p>Demand was fuelled by the release of a number of delayed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d5871d8-3ea7-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca\">franchise films</a> such as <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em> and the latest Bond film <em>No Time to Die</em>, which together accounted for half the month's total revenue. </p> <p>Of the top five biggest-grossing movies last month, three were released simultaneously on streaming platforms, including <em>Dune, Halloween Kills</em> and <em>The Addams Family 2</em>. Some in the industry think this is problematic.</p> <p>“Simultaneous release is a pandemic-era artefact that should be left to history with the pandemic itself,” wrote The National Association of Theatre Owners after <em>Black Widow</em> was released on Disney Plus and in cinemas on the same day. </p> <p>A Financial Times analysis of Comscore's box office data for some of the year's biggest movies in North America show that those with a simultaneous release tend to underperform films exclusively released in cinemas. </p> <p>In their second week, box office revenues for simultaneous release films fell by a median of 57 per cent, compared with 54 per cent for theatrical-exclusives. While the difference is not huge, it can add up to millions of dollars. &#xa0;</p> <p>Beyond the second week, cumulative gross receipts also rose faster on average for cinema exclusives. </p> <p>“The simultaneous release model hurts the long-term potential box office gross because the diehard fans will rush out [on] opening weekend and over the long haul, [while] the less enthusiastic given the option may choose to watch a film at home,”&#xa0;said Paul Dergarabedian, Senior Media Analyst at Comscore.</p> <p>In its second week, box office revenues for <em>Black Widow</em> fell 65 per cent, with receipts flattening from the fifth week. It achieved cumulative gross of $184m over 14 weeks, more or less the same figure that Marvel's cinema-exclusive <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> generated in three weeks.</p> <p>Revenues for <em>Free Guy</em>, which had an exclusive 45-day cinema window fell just 36 per cent in the second week, one of the best performances of any wide release of the summer. </p> <p>Cinema-only films also had higher opening weekend multiples — the ratio between their total box office and the opening weekend figure. This metric is used by industry analysts to assess the long-term popularity of a film. <em>Black Widow</em> achieved a multiple of 2.3 times over 14 weeks compared with <em>Shang-Chi</em> at 3.0 times in 10 weeks and <em>Free Guy</em> which hit 4.3 times after 13 weeks. </p> <p>“A movie that drops 65 plus per cent in its second weekend, either due to poor word-of-mouth or other factors such as streaming availability, may see a diminished ability to generate a big multiple,” said Dergarabedian. </p> <p>Cinema owners also argue that simultaneous release fuels piracy, with pristine digital copies of streamed films available online within hours of release.</p> <p>“We saw massive spikes in piracy as soon as a film was released on streaming”, said Ernesto Van der Sar, founder of TorrentFreak, a website publishing news on copyright, privacy and file-sharing. “However, it is hard to conclude that overall box office sales are cannibalised. It's likely piracy volumes are just brought forward,” he added. </p> <p><em>Black Widow</em> was the most pirated film for three consecutive weeks after its release in July according to TorrentFreak, and was pirated at more than four times the rate of <em>Shang-Chi </em>in the first 10 days of their release. </p> <p>In the face of these challenges, HBOMax owner WarnerMedia has said it will abandon simultaneous release next year, while Disney has said that its remaining 2021 films will have a minimum 45-day exclusive cinema release, with the exception of <em>Encanto,</em> which will be 30 days.</p> <p>The National Association of Theatre Owners is blunt about why this is the right thing to do: “The only real threat to the future of cinema is from bad business decisions driven by the heedless rush to streaming.”</p><p>Source: Chris Campbell and Patrick Mathurin in London 2021 'Cinema owners say simultaneous streaming has become a scourge' FT.com 12 November.
