  "title": "What's new on Hulu in September 2021, and what's leaving",
  "text": "<p>That would be “Y: The Last Man” (Sept. 13), the long awaited post-apocalyptic drama based on the iconic graphic novel that ran from 2002-'06, about a world in which every mammal with a Y chromosome has died off — except for one man and his monkey. Movie rights were first sold in 2007, but various attempts sputtered out, and FX's development of the series began way back in 2015. Fans are sure to have high hopes for the series, which stars Ben Schnetzer as Yorick (aka the Last Man) and Diane Lane as his mother, who's also the new president.</p><p>The Disney DIS-controlled streaming service also has a few more originals on tap: “The Premise” (Sept. 16), an anthology series from B.J. Novak (“The Office”) with “shared morality stories” about modern life, featuring big names such as Jon Bernthal, Ben Platt, Tracee Ellis Ross, Daniel Dae Kim, Ed Asner (in one of his final roles) and Beau Bridges; Season 2 of “Wu-Tang: An American Saga” (Sept. 8), the biographical drama about the early years of the iconic rap group, this time focusing on the making of their 1993 debut album, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)”; and “The D'Amelio Show” (Sept. 3), a reality series about TikTok celebrity sisters and their family.</p><p>Also coming to Hulu: Season 3 of the brilliant vampire mockumentary “What We Do in the Shadows” (starting Sept. 3, with new episodes streaming a day after they air on FX); and a ton of fall series streaming a day after they air on network TV, including “The Voice” (Sept. 21), “The Wonder Years” reboot (Sept. 23), “Bob's Burgers” (Sept. 27) and “The Good Doctor” (Sept. 28).</p><p>More streaming: What's coming in September to Netflix | Amazon Prime Video</p><p>New movies in September include “A Fish Called Wanda,” “Edward Scissorhands,” “Grosse Pointe Blank” and “Raising Arizona” (all Sept. 1), while “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol,” “Caddyshack” and “Galaxy Quest” are among favorites leaving by the end of the month.</p><p>Here's a complete list of what's coming and going, as of Aug. 30 (release dates are subject to change):</p><p>What's coming in September 2021</p><p>Sept. 150/50 (2011)A Fish Called Wanda (1988)Anaconda (1997)Angel Unchained (1970)The Apparition (2012)At the Earth's Core (1976)Blue City (1986)Bull Durham (1988)Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)Cannon for Cordoba (1970)Cellar Dweller (1988)Cold Creek Manor (2003)Count Yorga, Vampire (1970)Crazy Heart (2009)The Dunwich Horror (1970)Edward Scissorhands (1990)El Dorado (1967)Election (1999)Exterminator 2 (1984)Free Willy (1993)Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)Free Willy 3: The Rescue (1997)Free Willy: Escape From Pirate's Cove (2010)Friday the 13th – Part III (1982)Friday the 13th – Part IV: The Final Chapter (1984)Fright Night (1985)Gattaca (1997)Girls!
