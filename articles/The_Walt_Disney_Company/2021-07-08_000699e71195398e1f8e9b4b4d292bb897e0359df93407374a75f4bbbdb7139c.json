  "title": "Gabriel Byrne: ‘There will always be an existential threat' ",
  "text": "<p>In 1983, Gabriel Byrne was sent on a last-minute trip to Venice to film a scene for <em>Wagner</em>, a TV series about the German composer starring Richard Burton. Byrne was at the start of his career and had landed the role of Karl Ritter, Wagner's patron. He was on welfare and living in a rundown flat in London at the time, so couldn't believe his luck at finding himself in a fancy hotel on the Grand Canal. </p> <p>However, the first day's filming was calamitous, with Byrne's moustache constantly falling off. At the end of it, Burton invited him to his room for a drink, where he offered some advice: “Give it all you've got but never forget it's just a bloody movie, that's all it is. We're not curing cancer.”</p> <p>“This was a man I hugely respected and revered as an actor telling me: ‘Be careful. This isn't real life',” Byrne recalls now. “Because I saw what happened whenever he stepped out of the hotel. It was insane. Seventy or 100 photographers jumping over each other at five o'clock in the morning to take photographs of him.” Byrne, now 71, heeded Burton's words and resolved never to allow his head to be turned by celebrity.</p> <p>Their encounter is detailed in his memoir <em>Walking With Ghosts</em>, published late last year, which contains lyrical snapshots of his life and career and reflects on his uncomfortable relationship with fame. First, though, we have the apocalypse to discuss, specifically Byrne's role in the darkly atmospheric update of HG Wells' novel <em>War of the Worlds</em>, which returns for a second series on Disney Plus next week. </p> <p>Set in the present day, the action is split between northern France and London, and follows the progress of various groups of survivors — among them Byrne's pensive neuroscientist, Bill Ward — as they search for their loved ones while dodging the homicidal aliens that have wiped out most of humanity.</p> <p>Speaking over Zoom from a hotel in an undisclosed location in the UK —&#xa0;Byrne is currently filming, but isn't able to reveal what yet — he is warm, thoughtful and unfailingly courteous, despite his clear exhaustion after a long day's work. He read Wells' book while in his teens, though it wasn't until he re-read it at university that he absorbed its significance. </p> <p>“It's prophetic,” he says. “And it's always relevant. When you go back to it, you see things in it that you didn't see before. There will always be some kind of existential threat [that underlines] the fragility of humankind, whether that's nuclear war or the environment. In my opinion, there are far more scary things in the world than aliens getting out of a flying saucer.”</p> <p>Byrne recalls the very real fear of a nuclear attack while he was growing up in Walkinstown, Dublin, in the 1950s and early 1960s. “That was the first time that people talked about the annihilation of the world, and it was a real thing that could happen next Tuesday,” he says. “It wasn't something vague. There was a possibility of every single person that you knew, and every place, being obliterated. To know that at 10 or 11 years of age, it stays with you. I understood deep in myself that the world wasn't something you can depend on.”</p> <p>He recalls a question hanging over the filming of the first series of <em>War of the Worlds</em> in 2019. “We were asking: ‘What is the threat?' I remember one of the crew saying: ‘Who's going to believe London having empty streets, with people too afraid to go out?' And then, of course, Covid happened.”</p> <p>Byrne is best known for his big film roles —&#xa0;he made his name as the leading man in the Coen brothers' mobster movie <em>Miller's Crossing</em>, and later in Gillian Armstrong's adaptation of <em>Little Women</em> (the book remains one of his favourites) and Bryan Singer's <em>The Usual Suspects</em>. Yet it was a stint on a rural Irish TV soap called <em>The Riordans</em> in the late 1970s —&#xa0;he played the flamboyant and handsome Pat Barry —&#xa0;that set him on his way. </p> <p>He notes how he has witnessed big changes in how we tell and watch stories in film and TV. He recalls working on John Boorman's 1981 film <em>Excalibur</em>, in which he played King Uther Pendragon — “and I could not understand why we were there three days shooting the same scene. That was really a luxury that we had back then. But television isn't about hanging around to see what the atmosphere is like. It's about quick cuts and editing. It's just a faster-paced medium.”</p> <p>In 2008, Byrne starred in the HBO series <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8ea0cc4-a65c-4260-b2b2-9f546fe4244e\"><em>In Treatment</em></a>, about a 50-something psychotherapist, which he starred in for three seasons. He says he would do 35 pages of dialogue every two days —&#xa0;“in a chair, with just one other person opposite me. That was more theatre than TV or film. It was like doing a stage play three times a week.” </p> <p>He observes how TV networks now have more money and a faster turnover, and so are allowed to take risks, which can allow for more exciting creative decisions. But he worries about where this leaves independent film-making. “I remember being in a cinema in New York [recently], and there were three people there, including me. Then the other two left, and I thought: ‘My God, this film has probably taken four years to get made and there's nobody watching it.'”</p> <p>As a young man, Byrne found a passion for film via his grandmother, who was the first to take him to the cinema. He writes wistfully in <em>Walking With Ghosts</em> about his local picture house — “I saw sometimes 10 films a week in a fog of cigarette smoke and disinfectant . . . The picture house is a carpet showroom now.” </p> <p>Byrne was worried before he started on the book about his ability to remember the details of his past —&#xa0;“but then there's this magic when you pick up the pen and find, in a way that you can't explain, that the pen connects with your unconscious”.</p> <p>Rather than a chronological account of his life, the book comprises a series of vignettes that hop back and forth across the decades, documenting his school days; his early years of employment during which he worked as a dishwasher, a hotel toilet attendant, a plumber and an encyclopedia salesman; and his acting career. </p> <p>There are moments of trauma —&#xa0;he recounts the sexual abuse he endured at a Catholic seminary where he was training to be a priest — and there is humour, too. Filming <em>Excalibur</em>, he recalls the awful squeaking noise that accompanied his plunging the titular sword into the stone (the weapon was real but the rock was made of polystyrene). Elsewhere, he is caught in an earthquake during his first visit to Hollywood, and has an attack of diarrhoea after his first communion, a scene that his mother later related to an assembled audience at the Galway Film Festival.</p> <p>When he's not working, Byrne lives a quiet life in Maine with his second wife, Hannah Beth King, a documentary maker, and their young daughter (he also has two children from his first marriage to actor Ellen Barkin). He compares going to Hollywood to “touching a hot stove. I touched it and then I thought: ‘Jesus, do I really want this?'” </p> <p>He recalls being told that, along with an agent, he would need a manager, a lawyer, a business manager and publicist — “and I would need a little bit of Botox to sort out the lines that were coming in on my forehead. And I was not an old man!” He adds that it was suggested casually, as if it were an entirely normal thing to do. “And that's what I mean about the ways the business seduces you. It does it in ways that are almost imperceptible . . . Botox! You have to wonder what Burton would have made of that.”</p> <p><em>‘War of the Worlds' is on Star on Disney Plus from July 16. ‘</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1529027438/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1529027438&amp;linkId=61834377878ee6aa89502163c8a19a7a\"><em>Walking With Ghosts</em></a><em>' is published by Picador</em></p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2021 'Gabriel Byrne: ‘There will always be an existential threat' ' FT.com 8 July.
