  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: New Christmas Movies Struggle to Push Aside Go-To Favorites",
  "text": "<p>Of the 10 most-watched holiday movies over the past month, only two were released this season, according to data provider and measurement company Samba TV: Netflix Inc.'s \"Falling for Christmas\" starring Lindsay Lohan and \"The Noel Diary\" starring Justin Hartley.</p><p>Neither attracted even half the households that tuned into the top movies on that list during the period -- 1989's \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,\" 1990's \"Home Alone,\" and 2003's \"Elf.\"</p><p>Samba TV, which collects data on what people are watching on their smart TVs, looked at how many households viewed holiday fare between Nov. 8 and Dec. 11. \"Falling for Christmas\" was released on Netflix on Nov. 10, while \"The Noel Diary\" came out on the streaming platform on Nov. 24.</p><p>Nic Nielsen, a father of three in Lancaster, S.C., said his family samples a range of new and older holiday films on streaming services including Netflix and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ every year. Watching \"Elf\" and \"Home Alone\" has become a family tradition, he said. He and his wife are divided on \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\": She isn't a fan, and he loves it.</p><p>More U.S. households watched holiday movies during that four-and-a-half-week stretch than they did in the same period last year, Samba TV found.</p><p>\"It seems each year like Americans are ready to get into the Christmas spirit earlier and earlier,\" said Ashwin Navin, co-founder and CEO of Samba TV.</p><p>Many consumers now watch holiday classics on streaming services such as Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max and Disney+.</p><p>Over the past decade, Hollywood studios and cable channels have cranked out evermore holiday content each year, from comedies to more saccharine dramas.</p><p>Hallmark Media made 40 original holiday movies this year, up from 38 in 2021, a spokeswoman said. A&amp;E Networks-owned Lifetime, another major producer of holiday films, made 26 movies this year, compared with 35 last year, and the films cost an average of $2 million per title to make, a spokeswoman said. GAC Family, a cable channel run by Hallmark's former boss, is releasing 18 movies this year, up 50% from 2021.</p><p>Streaming services are increasingly getting into the action. AppleTV+ released \"Spirited\" starring Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds on its platform on Nov. 18, while HBO Max debuted new titles including \"Holiday Harmony\" on Nov. 24 and \"A Christmas Story Christmas\" on Nov. 17.</p><p>Beyond \"Falling for Christmas\" and \"The Noel Diary,\" Netflix also released \"Christmas With You,\" starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Aimee Garcia, on Nov. 17.</p><p>\"The Noel Diary\" landed in Netflix's own top 10 rankings of the most-watched English-language films on its service by hours viewed in the week ended Dec. 11, its third consecutive week on that list. \"Falling for Christmas\" made those rankings for four consecutive weeks, through Dec. 4, and rose to the No. 1 spot in its second week of release.</p><p>Samba TV said some 3.2 million U.S. households watched \"Falling for Christmas,\" while 2.8 million watched \"The Noel Diary.\" By comparison, some 1.4 million households watched Apple's \"Spirited,\" not enough to land it in the top 10 list.</p><p>Mike Ernst, a 33-year-old Cincinnati resident, said new holiday films on streaming services are \"fighting an uphill battle, because when we were coming up there were just fewer options, and you watched the same movies every year.\" That built nostalgic habits that persist, said Mr. Ernst. He recently ran an interoffice bracket in which colleagues voted on holiday movies and declared \"Christmas Vacation\" the best holiday movie ever made.</p><p>A spokesman for HBO Max declined to comment, and Apple didn't respond to a request to comment.</p>",
