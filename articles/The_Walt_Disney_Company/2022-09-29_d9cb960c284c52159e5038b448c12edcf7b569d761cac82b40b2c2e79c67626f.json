  "title": "Aaron Judge looks to break American League home-run record — and then get the Yankees to break the bank; Judge hit his 61st home run of the season, tying the American League total from Roger Maris in 1961.",
  "text": "<p>Before Maris, Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in a single season. In Ruth's historic year, there were 154-games in the season, while Maris's had 162-games. The Maris family has attended each Yankee game recently in hopes to be there for the record-breaking performance.</p><p>See also:A long-shot option trade from HBO's 'Industry' would have paid off Wednesday when the 10-year Treasury yield topped 4%</p><p>The only players in history who have hit more than 61 home runs in a single season played in the National League and have been linked to steroid use.</p><p>Judge, 30, is, with his .313 batting average and 130 runs batted in through Wednesday night, one of baseball's brightest stars and on the inside track to be named the American League's MVP for 2022, according to odds from DraftKings DKNG Sportsbook.</p><p>See also: Kyrie Irving says he lost at least $100 million for deciding not to get vaccinated</p><p>But despite Judge's stellar career and standout 2022 season — he's led the Yankees to the second best record in the league and baseball's sixth best and has a very realistic shot at winning baseball's first triple crown since Miguel Cabrera's in 2012 (which, in turn, was the first since those of Carl Yastrzemski and Frank Robinson in the mid-1960s) — he has not yet truly cashed in.</p><p>In his seven seasons as a big leaguer, Judge has racked up just $36 million in contract earnings, according to Spotrac, for a career average annual salary of $5.14 million, not appreciably higher than the game's current average of $4.4 million. One reason is that Judge debuted with the Yankees in 2017 at a more advanced age, 25, than the typical rookie, pushing back the age at which Judge would first qualify for free agency. Judge is the 57th highest paid player this season at $19 million.</p><p>Judge, with his career .284 batting average and 219 career home runs, is set to capitalize on his accomplishments after this season, when he will be an unrestricted free agent and able to sign with any team for any amount of money that he and his agent can negotiate.
