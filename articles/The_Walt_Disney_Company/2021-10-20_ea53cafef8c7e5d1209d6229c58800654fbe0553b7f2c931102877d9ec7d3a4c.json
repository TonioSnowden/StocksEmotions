  "text": "<p>The desert in <em>Dune</em> is a killer and Denis Villeneuve could not be happier. The director's sci-fi epic is filled with the same strange glee at the endlessness of it all that once touched <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>. For the creator of blockbusters with brains like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a63148c6-6dab-11e5-8171-ba1968cf791a\"><em>Sicario</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19058188-a73e-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1\"><em>Arrival</em></a>, the dust-dry planet Arrakis is a day out at the beach. The movie is a $165m sandcastle.<br><br>Grandiose, sappy, ambitious, mesmeric, admirable, ponderous, flawed: <em>Dune</em> is all these things, a film made to awe in a time where movies can't even stop ticket holders scrolling on their phone. The daring doesn't end there. Consider the baggage: David Lynch's doomed 1984 adaptation; <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Avatar</em> borrowing so much from Frank Herbert's 1965 source novel that its plot can now feel second-hand. Then there are the stakeholders — an army of fans of the book — and the stakes, a potential key role in cinema's fragile comeback. Quite the responsibility. But such is also the lot of the hero — 102nd-century princeling Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet).<br><br>The budget demands a larger audience than the novel's fan base alone — one that might have limited interest in Herbert's denser minutiae. The set-up is duly set up. Chalamet's Paul is an heir to a dukedom in the enlightened House of Atreides, plagued by brutal rivals the Harkonnens but now controlling Arrakis — a wasteland were it not for the mining of the precious, multifunctional “spice”. From here Villeneuve storytells as gracefully as he can. As Paul finds himself thrust into an arcane power struggle, only once does Chalamet ask out loud: “What's happening?”</p> <p>The answer is a visible effort to avoid either of two worst-case scenarios — big, dumb travesty or over-faithful take on a book long called unfilmable. As if aware that it will probably be both at different points, <em>Dune</em> works best when Villeneuve simply makes what feels like the movie he wants to see himself.</p> <p>The cast can grab the eye. Rebecca Ferguson is eerily steely as Paul's telekinetic mother; Stellan Skarsgard memorably grotesque as cruel Baron Harkonnen. “Goodbye, young human,” snaps Charlotte Rampling, a line she was born to deliver. Most often though, <em>Dune</em>'s spectacle is <em>stuff</em> — the sombre pomp of palace interiors, sinister vats of gold and black gloop, and always the desert, made still more hellish by man-eating sandworms a quarter-mile long.<br><br>Scale means a lot in <em>Dune</em>, a film that really will reward a visit to the big screen. But scale here means more than size alone. It has to do too with a fuller sense of cinema — with scenes allowed to breathe, and a smorgasbord of visual detail. The director shapes the movie as a grand exercise in industrial design. Everything — from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a0acfb4-b16b-46dd-84e5-4c3c235a6cb4\">costumes</a> to objets to gleamingly strange aircraft — feels of a piece. <em>Dune</em> can't — shouldn't — be as involved as Herbert's novel. This is how a movie does it. At its best, the film conjures a whole, living world.<br><br>At its worst? Even only getting through the first half of the novel, <em>Dune</em> feels as long as it is wide. Not every shot registers as rapturous. Sometimes we're just looking at sand. And Chalamet remains more haircut than actor. Yet the film also has a credibly hard edge. Iraq and Afghanistan echo through colonised Arrakis. Vietnam went before both. A double homage to <em>Apocalypse Now</em> finds Skarsgard channelling first Marlon Brando then Martin Sheen — not that either hung like larvae from the ceiling. The whole Harkonnen gang are a creepshow.<br><br>Meanwhile, Paul has reveries of adventures beyond the closing credits. Villeneuve's nightmares linger more than Chalamet's dreams — but director and hero are again united. <em>Dune: Part One</em> the film calls itself on screen, an attempted fait accompli. Backers Warner Bros still haven't signed up for <em>Part Two</em>. Flaws aside, for Villeneuve to bring this much verve to the multiplex makes you will pen to paper.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas in the UK from October 21 and in cinemas and on HBO Max in the US from October 22</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Dune rewards a return to the big screen with a whole, living world' FT.com 20 October.
