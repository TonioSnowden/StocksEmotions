  "text": "<p>   I'm desperate to hang out some more with the Beatles, and I know I'm not alone in feeling this. I miss Paul, John, George and Ringo. I feel like we had such a great Thanksgiving weekend together -- them making iconic songs, sipping tea and mildly bickering, and me on the couch, lying in the darkness, microwaved leftovers on my chest. </p><p>   I feel like the Beatles and I could be friends. We could sing some Chuck Berry, play soccer -- sorry, football -- and crack some jokes about 007 and the Stones. I'm convinced of it after watching \"Get Back,\" director Peter Jackson's mesmerizing eight-hour documentary devoted to the band's final creative days. The three-episode film, which premiered on Disney+ on Nov. 25, chronicles the making of the band's \"Let it Be\" album, culminating in the famous London rooftop concert that served as the band's last live performance in public. </p><p>   The above description does no justice to what a sensory wonder this film is. Basically, you turn it on, and the Beatles move into your home for the weekend. \"Get Back\" draws on nearly 60 hours of footage filmed by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg to make his 1970 \"Let it Be\" documentary. Jackson uses AI technology to restore decades-old sounds and conversations, and the result is no less than a reanimation. There they are. Paul. John. George. Ringo. One of the great cultural forces of modern times, a band tinged by breakup and tragedy, is brought fully to life, in sharp color and focus. The first hour or so left me in shock. </p><p>   I'm very much a fan of the Beatles, but far from an expert in their complex and tangled history, so I'll leave the debate over the \"Let it Be\" era and the band's undoing to the critics, the Beatlemaniacs and whatever the two living members, McCartney and Starr, want to say. I know that cinema verite can only deliver so much verite; few people understood the manipulative power of a camera quite like the members of the Fab Four. In its own way, \"Get Back\" is a performance, like everything else they did. </p><p>   But \"Get Back\" feels like an exhilarating and welcome cinematic experience for a simple reason: It is present. The cameras take you there, and leave you; there are none of the well-trodden documentary devices, like gassy talking heads rambling out every five minutes to blather on about how great the Beatles were. The band's talents -- and shortcomings -- are simply placed in front of you, to figure out for yourself, in real time. (The \"Get Back\" scene in which McCartney fleshes out the titular song, mumbling out lyrics that will become \"Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner,\" is allowed to linger as a quiet discovery.) </p><p>   It's long. It's probably far too long to keep hold of people who aren't Beatles-mad, and there's endless small talk and digressions and jam sessions that never amount to anything. For all the charisma, there are unresolved questions and a good deal of well-known personal drama that gets ignored. </p><p>   Still, I liked \"Get Back\" for those reasons, too. In our glibocracy era, in which every communication must be atomized into a 10-second snippet for withered attention spans, it's invigorating to have something that wants and holds your brain for hours. Jackson's choices won't please everyone, and they haven't, and that's fine, too. That's the messiness of life, and \"Get Back\" is nothing if not brightly alive. My weekend watching reminded me of the Beatles' brilliance, but I'll mostly remember it for its human warmth. I already miss them. I miss my new best friends. </p><p></p>",
