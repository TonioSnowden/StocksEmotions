  "title": "The Cruise Trips Most in Demand Don't Embark Until 2022 and Beyond; As they track Covid-19, many fans of sailings on Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other lines are booking far in advance to hedge their bets",
  "text": "<p>Many cruise lines say they expect 2022 to be a strong year. As of early August, Viking Cruises' bookings for 2022 were 42% ahead of where they were at the same point in 2019. Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line have also said demand for 2022 is strong when compared with 2019, even considering higher prices.</p><p>The strong demand extends past next year. Regent Seven Seas Cruises' 132-night world cruise, set to sail in 2024, sold out its 350 two-person rooms in less than three hours, even with tickets starting at over $73,000.</p><p>Christine Hardenberger, owner of Modern Travel Professionals, based in Fredericksburg, Va., says her clients want cruise vacations and are willing to book. But some are hesitant to travel in the short term because they have questions about changing protocols. She typically sees an even mix of short-term bookings, for trips that take place within three months, and longer-term bookings. Lately she is seeing far fewer last-minute bookings.</p><p>Dean Barnett, a retired nurse who lives in Pueblo, Colo., generally travels on a cruise every other year. This would typically be the year he and his wife go, but they haven't booked anything yet.</p><p>Mr. Barnett says he is keeping an eye on deals. He is hoping to go on a European river cruise and says some companies are offering big discounts for those who book now.</p><p>He adds that he is going to wait until he and his wife get their booster shots against Covid-19. \"Then [we'll] pull the trigger on booking a cruise as soon as possible after that,\" he says. They are likely to travel next year, he says.</p><p>Some travel agents say those hoping to embark in the next few months can find good deals from cruise lines. \"They're making it really affordable for people to just jump on and travel,\" says Jasmin Samlal, a travel agent based in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area. The Cruise Lines International Association says it projects that about 56% of oceangoing ship capacity will have resumed sailing by the end of September.</p><p>Cruise operators working in U.S. waters must satisfy guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those requirements allow ships to begin regular operations without first conducting test cruises if they attest that 95% of crew members and passengers are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Norwegian Cruise Line requires 100% of passengers and crew to be vaccinated, a policy that has been upheld in federal court but that the state of Florida has appealed.</p><p>Passengers have tested positive for Covid-19 on U.S. cruises this summer. Most cruise lines decline to provide information about how many passengers and crew members have been infected. In a Facebook post, Royal Caribbean Chief Executive Michael Bayley said typically one to two guests test positive out of the more than one thousand people on board each ship.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>When will you be ready to take a cruise? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Some cruise-goers say the high vaccination rates have left them feeling reassured about their trips. Jay Rainey, who owns an insurance agency outside of Cincinnati, has been on more than two dozen cruises. He and his husband will embark next month on the Carnival Mardi Gras for a seven-night sail. They are both vaccinated and plan to social distance on the ship. He says he wasn't too concerned that another Carnival cruise ship had 27 people test positive, including 26 crew members and one passenger, because they represented a small fraction of the more than 4,000 people on board.</p><p>\"That speaks to masks and vaccinations working, plus the cruise-ship safety policy,\" he says.</p><p>With the rise of the Covid-19 Delta variant, cruise lines have instituted additional policies, with many requiring even fully vaccinated passengers to submit a negative coronavirus test within three days of departure and wear masks in certain indoor spaces. Viking is requiring frequent PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, tests throughout every itinerary. The tests search for the virus's genetic code.</p><p>\"Once we had our vaccines and negative tests, we were so excited to go,\" says Carah Buscho, a master's student in Galveston, Texas, who recently returned from a Royal Caribbean cruise with her family.</p><p>Cruise lines are still operating under restricted capacity. Ms. Buscho says that with her ship far from capacity she missed out on the big gatherings she experienced in the past. Still, she says, \"we didn't hate that it was so quiet, because it really let us relax.\"</p><p>The additional policies have led some cruise-goers to postpone their trips. Tony D'Aiuto, an airport-operations-center training manager who lives in Central Florida, planned to go on a Disney cruise with his wife and 2-year-old daughter in September. Mr. D'Aiuto says he is pro-mask and pro-vaccine, but after Disney said all passengers 2 and older needed to wear masks indoors, he began to have doubts about the trip. It has been difficult for his daughter to consistently keep her mask on.</p><p>\"It just didn't seem to make sense for us this time,\" he says. They were able to get a full refund and plan to look into rescheduling, potentially for next year.</p><p>Anna Pickel, a child-care provider near Portland, Ore., and her husband made a deposit earlier this month on a Carnival cruise for December 2022.</p><p>Ms. Pickel has two children, ages 9 and 3, and says she won't get on a plane with them until they are vaccinated. They are hoping the Covid-19 situation will have improved by then, and vaccinations will be available for children. \"We wanted to give all of us something to look forward to and have something fun planned,\" she says.</p><p>Write to Allison Pohle at Allison.Pohle@wsj.com</p><p>The Cruise Trips Most in Demand Don't Embark Until 2022 and Beyond</p>",
