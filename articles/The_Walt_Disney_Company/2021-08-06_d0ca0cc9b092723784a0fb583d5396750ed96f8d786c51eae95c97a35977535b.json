  "title": "Viacom Adds 6.5 Million Users  ---  Comcast's Sky TV to  distribute Paramount+  streaming service in  European markets  ----  By Benjamin Mullin",
  "text": "<p>    ViacomCBS Inc. said it added 6.5 million streaming subscribers across its platforms in the second quarter and unveiled a partnership with Comcast Corp.'s Sky TV unit to distribute its Paramount+ service in several European markets. </p><p>   The company, which owns the CBS broadcast network, the Paramount studio and cable channels such as MTV and Comedy Central, said revenue increased 8% to $6.56 billion in the quarter, powered by gains in streaming video and advertising sales. </p><p>   Viacom's operating income decreased 2% to $1.23 billion, due in part to the costs associated with Paramount+ and lower licensing revenue compared with a year earlier, when there was a substantial gain from licensing \"South Park\" to WarnerMedia. </p><p>   The agreement with Comcast makes Paramount+ available free to subscribers of Comcast's Sky Cinema service in Sky markets including the U.K., Switzerland, Italy and Germany, the company said. The pact also extends the deal to carry ViacomCBS channels on Sky's pay-TV systems. </p><p>    The Wall Street Journal last month reported that Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts met with ViacomCBS Chairwoman Shari Redstone and ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish to discuss how the companies could join forces in international markets. </p><p>   Also on Thursday, ViacomCBS said that it has struck a six-year deal with \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone that covers six new seasons of the \"South Park\" TV show on Comedy Central and 14 \"South Park\" movies for Paramount+. ViacomCBS is paying Messrs. Stone and Parker $900 million in the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg earlier reported on the creators' deal. </p><p>   Asked on an earnings call whether ViacomCBS could be a candidate for a merger, Mr. Bakish said the company is growing by itself but is open to opportunities that would benefit shareholders. </p><p>   \"We believe organic execution continues to be the right path for Viacom, CBS and our shareholders,\" he said. </p><p>   ViacomCBS, which also has streaming services for Showtime and BET as well as the children-oriented service Noggin, said it now has 42 million total streaming subscribers. ViacomCBS didn't disclose how many subscribers Paramount+ has but said it fueled gains in the quarter. </p><p>   The company's streaming revenue grew by 92% in the second quarter to $983 million, with $481 million generated by subscriptions and $502 million by advertising. </p><p>   ViacomCBS competes with Comcast's Peacock in the U.S. along with an array of other services such as Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+, Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video. Paramount+ is a relative newcomer to the marketplace, having launched in March. </p><p>   Longtime streaming leader Netflix reported 1.5 million new streaming subscribers world-wide in the second quarter and lost 400,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, reflecting a maturing domestic market. </p><p>   Collectively, WarnerMedia's HBO TV channel and HBO Max streaming service added roughly three million domestic subscribers in the second quarter. </p><p>   ViacomCBS's theatrical business rebounded compared with the year-earlier quarter, when the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic closed theaters around the world. </p><p>   Theatrical revenue increased to $134 million compared with $3 million during the same period last year, reflecting the debut of sci-fi thriller \"A Quiet Place Part II.\" </p><p>   ViacomCBS's advertising revenue rose 24% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter, while affiliate revenue grew by 9% as the company struck agreements with distributors that locked in higher fees. </p><p>   Net income in the quarter more than doubled to $995 million, or $1.50 a share, from $453 million, or 73 cents a share a year ago, boosted by a tax gain and the comparison to the year-earlier period, when various one-time charges weighed on results. </p><p>   The tax gain stems from the sale of Westinghouse Licensing Corp., a business that licenses the Westinghouse brand, to a group of investors, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p></p>",
