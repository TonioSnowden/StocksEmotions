  "title": "The Hotel Inside the Bass Pro Shops Inside the Pyramid; Shoppers are returning to stores. Some die-hard consumers will travel to the Big Cypress Lodge, a hotel within a hunting and fishing superstore within a former NBA arena.",
  "text": "<p>\"The time is now 6 p.m. and Bass Pro Shops is officially closed.\"</p><p>The 103-room lodge sits not in the wilderness but inside a sprawling retail shrine to hunting and fishing fanatics and the people who love them. (My 23-year-old son is the former, I'm the latter.)</p><p>It's the only hotel inside a Bass Pro Shops store.</p><p>Shoppers are spending more time and money in stores so far this holiday season. Few bricks-and-mortar businesses go to the bizarre extremes that this one does to lure them in.</p><p>The 535,000-square-foot store, a mashup of a mall, Disneyland, aquarium, zoo, shooting range, bowling alley, celebrity restaurant, souvenir shop and observation deck, is the largest in the chain. And the only one housed in a pyramid that was a sports and concert arena in a previous life. The NBA's Memphis Grizzlies played there briefly in the early 2000s and boxer Mike Tyson lost a fight there.</p><p>Bass Pro Shops founder and chief executive Johnny Morris has other hotels, including Big Cedar Lodge in Missouri and a planned oceanfront resort in Florida, but none with a store.</p><p>Retail-hospitality tie-ups aren't new. IKEA has a 254-room hotel in Sweden, and the company formerly known as Restoration Hardware just opened RH Guesthouse in New York City. There are hotels galore attached to or near shopping malls.</p><p>But guests of those hotels don't stay in the store, unlike at Big Cypress. The lodge's front desk is inside the main entrance to the store. Guests with balcony rooms have 24/7 views into the place—trout pond, Cypress trees, neon shop lights and all—even when the store is closed.</p><p>Surveying the quiet scene from my balcony at 4:30 a.m. on Black Friday before the store opened, I felt a little like Will Ferrell's character in \"Elf\" the night he camped out at Gimbels department store to redecorate for Santa's visit.</p><p>I watched employees restock oversize Christmas-colored boxes with $19.98 RedHead shirt jackets and $10 flannel shirts ahead of the 5 a.m. store opening. They chatted about the growing crowds outside, noting the lines already snaking out to the street.</p><p>Once the store opened, I took the elevator down one floor and stopped at the Sunglass Hut directly below my room. The manager regaled early shoppers with tales of Bass Pro's resident ducks that hold a \"morning meeting\" in the store—except on Black Friday, when it's too busy and too bright too early.</p><p>That night, I caught a stunning sunset at the observation deck with views of the Mississippi River atop the pyramid. We roasted s'mores at an outdoor fire pit at the hotel with a $5 kit sold at the front desk.</p><p>My room was $280 a night before taxes and fees. Rooms without a balcony cost less. The hotel's suites, cabins and treehouses are more.</p><p>Room 208 has plenty of space and amenities: comfy beds and pillows, silky bathrobes with the Big Cypress logo and room service. I wasn't a fan of the mule deer head mounted to the wall between our queen-size beds, but my son admired the good size buck. (A colleague's sister covered the deer in her room during her stay at Big Cypress.)</p><p>The animal motif is hard to escape. The front desk clerk called me Mama Bear. My room's Do Not Disturb sign featured a bear and read \"Hibernating,\" and the Wi-Fi password was named for a taxidermied bear on display in the bar on the hotel's third floor.</p><p>Forget Memphis's famous barbecue. Wild game is the staple on restaurant menus at the Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid, with elk sliders and a charcuterie board with venison and duck sausage featured at the Lookout restaurant 28 stories up. Hotel guests get free elevator rides to the restaurant and observation deck, and handy line-skipping passes. Elsewhere, there is the Wahlburgers Wild burger joint owned by Mark Wahlberg and his family.</p><p>Hotel-retail combinations attract travelers with similar interests, says Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics for CoStar Group.</p><p>\"You can meet somebody at the bar and talk about the elk you shot or the bass you caught and it's not weird,\" he says.</p><p>Felicia Kittrell, a Nashville hospital worker, still remembers her response when her husband, Terry, asked her if she wanted to go with him to Bass Pro Shops to look at fishing poles more than 25 years ago.</p><p>\"No way, I don't want to go to no Bass Pro,\" Mrs. Kittrell responded. \"Then when I got in there and realized all the stuff they had, I've been hooked ever since.\"</p><p>On Friday, the couple drove three hours from Nashville to check into Big Cypress Lodge for their 42nd wedding anniversary. She wore a navy blue vest from Bass Pro and had the chain's Black Friday sales flier in her suitcase.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's the quirkiest hotel you've stayed at? Join the conversation below.</p><p>LeBron James initially drew Kathy and Cody Frederick to Big Cypress Lodge. The Red Bud, Ill., couple bought tickets to a Grizzlies-Los Angeles Lakers game in December 2018 as part of a holiday travel tradition with their son. (The Grizzlies now play at the nearby FedExForum.) The lodge's cabinlike rooms, balcony and motif reminded them of their honeymoon at Disney's Wilderness Lodge in Florida.</p><p>The store was an afterthought. \"We have family members who hunt and fish,\" says Mr. Frederick, a computer programmer.</p><p>\"We just are not the family members that do that,\" adds Mrs. Frederick, who is a paralegal.</p><p>They returned to Big Cypress for two nights around Thanksgiving this year to catch a Grizzlies-New Orleans Pelicans game. At the store, they snapped selfies on an ATV decked out in holiday lights, ate at Wahlburgers and did some Christmas shopping.</p><p>\"I'm supposed to be looking for hunting gloves for my nephew,\" Mrs. Frederick said, \"and I'm like, 'What are hunting gloves?'\"</p><p>Write to Dawn Gilbertson at dawn.gilbertson@wsj.com</p><p>The Hotel Inside the Bass Pro Shops Inside the Pyramid</p>",
