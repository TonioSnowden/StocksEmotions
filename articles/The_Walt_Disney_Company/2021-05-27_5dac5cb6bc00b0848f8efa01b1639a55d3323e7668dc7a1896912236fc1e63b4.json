  "text": "<p>(WSJ May 29, 2021)</p><p>(END)</p><p>Amazon.com Inc. said it has agreed to acquire Hollywood studio MGM Holdings, a deal the e-commerce giant is betting can jump-start its Prime Video streaming platform and position it to compete with industry heavyweights including Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co.</p><p>The purchase, which was unveiled Wednesday morning, has an equity value of $6.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Including debt, the value of the deal is $8.45 billion, Amazon said. It is the second-largest acquisition in the company's history behind its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.</p><p>In MGM, Amazon will get a library of more than 4,000 films, including franchises such as James Bond and \"Rocky,\" and classics such as \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" \"Raging Bull\" and \"12 Angry Men.\" The TV catalog includes critically acclaimed shows such as \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" \"Fargo\" and \"Vikings.\"</p><p>\"The acquisition's thesis here is really very simple,\" Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said during a call with shareholders Wednesday. \"MGM has a vast, deep catalog of much-beloved intellectual property, and with the talented people at MGM and the talented people at Amazon Studios, we can reimagine and develop that IP for the 21st century.\"</p><p>Amazon said in February that Mr. Bezos would be stepping down as CEO, a leadership change that leaves top lieutenant Andy Jassy to oversee MGM's integration into the company when he takes the reins on July 5.</p><p>MGM Chairman Kevin Ulrich had sought $10 billion for the company, scaring off some potential suitors, such as Apple Inc. and Sony Group Corp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment, a person close to him said. Amazon, hungry for more content for Prime Video, had a greater appetite than others.</p><p>The tech giant had approached MGM multiple times over the past 18 months, according to people familiar with the talks. At one point in their discussions, MGM and Amazon brass weighed a possible deal to bring the latest James Bond film to the Amazon's streaming service while movie theaters remained closed during the pandemic, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Late last year, Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, contacted Mr. Ulrich and subsequently took the lead on merger talks, which for months didn't move past the exploratory stage, according to people familiar with the matter. That changed about five weeks ago when the tech giant made its offer.</p><p>The board quickly signed off, and the two reached an agreement Monday, according to people close to the deal. The companies decided to hold the announcement for Wednesday out of sensitivity that Tuesday was the first anniversary of George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police, the people said.</p><p>Besides MGM, Amazon also approached Sony Pictures Entertainment about an acquisition but was rebuffed, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The merger agreement comes as Amazon faces antitrust scrutiny from U.S. and foreign regulators over a range of its business practices. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) said Wednesday that the move should be subject to a federal probe.</p><p>\"This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers,\" she said. \"The Department of Justice must conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that this deal won't risk harming competition.\"</p><p>The acquisition is the latest in a series of mergers that are shaking the entertainment industry as media and tech companies fight for supremacy in the streaming age.</p><p>This month, AT&amp;T Inc. said it would spin off its WarnerMedia assets and merge them with Discovery Inc. In recent years, Walt Disney bought most of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox, and Viacom Inc. recombined with CBS Corp.</p><p>---</p><p>Cara Lombardo contributed to this article.</p>",
