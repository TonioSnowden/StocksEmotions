  "title": "AMC Struggles in Saudi Arabia",
  "text": "<p>AMC said it would open up to 20 cinemas by the end of last year but currently runs 10, with about 65 screens. Its two biggest competitors, Saudi brand Muvi and Dubai-based Vox Cinemas, run roughly 150 screens each, despite winning licenses to operate after AMC and without the direct government support that AMC has. Three other firms are building cinemas, and three more have obtained licenses, according to investment bank Saudi Fransi Capital, making Saudi Arabia a competitive market.</p><p>Earlier this year, AMC's Saudi operation replaced its chief executive, John Iozzi, and installed a former executive at Vox's parent company as interim CEO, according to people familiar with the changes.</p><p>Now, the Saudi government is taking greater control of its joint venture with AMC, and the two sides plan to renegotiate the terms of their contract, according to people familiar with the partnership. AMC currently owns 10% of the joint venture with Saudi Entertainment Ventures, a subsidiary of the country's sovereign-wealth fund, and the American firm receives fees for licensing its brand and for managing the partnership, these people said.</p><p>A new-look partnership is likely to involve a simpler relationship whereby Saudi Entertainment Ventures, also known as Seven, pays a fee to license AMC's brand but runs the operation, according to a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said the pandemic slowed the pace of its theater openings. \"AMC is perfectly happy and content with our expansion into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\" Mr. Aron said.</p><p>AMC has invested at least $10 million, or roughly $1 million per theater, in its partnership with Seven, according to a person familiar with the details and public statements. A spokesman for Seven didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Seven joined with AMC thinking the operator would bring expertise developing cinemas, said John Sullivan, director of the Big Picture, a cinema-development consulting firm that advised on Muvi's establishment. But the U.S. firm's size has largely come via acquisitions of competitors, rather than experience in new emerging markets, he said.</p><p>AMC entered the kingdom thinking its brand was internationally recognized, and therefore landlords would want AMC screens in commercial centers, people familiar with the rollout said. But the U.S. firm didn't have local connections like Muvi and Vox, the people added.</p><p>\"The average Saudi national, they knew AMC only when [AMC] came to the market,\" said Haitham al-Shammari, CEO of Gulf Hub, an executive-search consulting firm based in Riyadh, and a former adviser to Seven. \"Vox is very well known to the Saudis.\"</p><p>Kansas-based AMC lauded the opportunity in the kingdom when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2017 announced the reopening of theaters. Saudi Arabia banned cinemas in the 1980s as its rulers allowed conservative clerics greater influence.</p><p>AMC first began talking to Saudi officials about a presence in the kingdom in November 2017 when Mr. Aron attended a conference in the capital, Riyadh, according to a person involved. That December, the two sides unveiled a memorandum of understanding to build cinemas, the same day the kingdom announced it was ending the theater ban.</p><p>In April 2018, AMC hosted the first movie shown in Saudi Arabia since the 1980s, Walt Disney Co.'s \"Black Panther,\" seen as symbolic because it told the story of a young prince trying to modernize his country.</p><p>But after the killing in October 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- an operation the Central Intelligence Agency concluded Prince Mohammed likely ordered -- foreign-investment interest cooled. The kingdom denied any involvement of the crown prince.</p><p>Even as other executives pulled deals, Mr. Aron said AMC would continue to work in the kingdom, citing the best interests of Saudi Arabia's 35 million people.</p><p>Globally, AMC's share price has been on a tear in recent months, fueled by interest among individual investors. Using liquidity raised by these thousands of shareholders, AMC has acquired more than half a dozen new locations in the U.S.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
