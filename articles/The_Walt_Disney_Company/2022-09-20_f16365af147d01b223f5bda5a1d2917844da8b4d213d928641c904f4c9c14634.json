  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  The Politics of a Nice Cup of Black Rifle Coffee",
  "text": "<p>   It is ironic that Megan Keller's op-ed \"A Socially Conscious but Politically Incorrect Company\" (Sept. 16) was published on National POW/MIA Recognition Day. Many financial institutions seem to have been more concerned about their ESG scores than their shareholder returns, given that they wouldn't bank for Black Rifle Coffee or participate in what appeared to be lucrative financial deals. </p><p>   I am not surprised by the law firm that \"thought no one from top law schools would be willing to work at the firm if it took on Black Rifle as a client, especially because its name included the word 'rifle.'\" It demonstrates, however, the lack of respect, gratitude and support that the left gives to the women and men who serve to make us and keep us free. </p><p>   Byron Anderson </p><p>   Saratoga, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Keller expresses concerns over the treatment of Black Rifle's CEO, Evan Hafer, and whether that will have an effect on his business. With revenues of $233 million, it certainly doesn't seem so. And so what about finance and law firms that decline to do business with Black Rifle? Isn't that part of our free-market economy? You get to choose with whom you do business, and you get to decide the reasons to do so. </p><p>   Let's also not characterize the decisions of various finance and law firms not to work with Black Rifle as antiveteran, as if any company has a monopoly on veteran support and employment. Those decisions are simply anti-Trump and anti-right-wing. Similarly, the decisions of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Disney have been anti-Disney and anti-left-wing. </p><p>   Given Disney's predicament with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, I'd say, for Black Rifle, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. </p><p>   Rich Comstock </p><p>   Akron, Ohio </p><p>   --- </p><p>   For decades, my wife and I drank nothing but Starbucks coffee. We visited the stores religiously, ground their beans and even bought their stock. Our youngest son worked his way through school at Starbucks. Now, when I have my morning coffee, it is Black Rifle. This isn't because of optics or the company's social or political statements -- for we all know Starbucks has made its own statements over the years. It is because Black Rifle offers a better cup of coffee. </p><p>   Michael J. McGuire </p><p>   Neenah, Wis. </p><p></p>",
