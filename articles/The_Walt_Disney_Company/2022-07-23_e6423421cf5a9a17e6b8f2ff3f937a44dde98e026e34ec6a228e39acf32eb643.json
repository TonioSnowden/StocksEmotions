  "text": "<p>   In this sense, Marvel or Star Wars movies actually benefit from being synthetic commercial products, with no pretensions to genuine authority. Even the nearly 400,000 people who listed their religion as \"Jedi\" on the 2001 U.K. census did so with tongue in cheek. In a time when Americans are increasingly rigid and defensive about their identities and opinions, the unseriousness of narrative universes is an asset, giving them a freedom to speculate that is rare in the nonfictional world. </p><p>   The story of Thanos, for instance -- the supervillain in \"Avengers: Endgame\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War\" -- is absurd on its face. By assembling six magic stones, he gains the power to destroy half the living things in the universe, sort of the way 10 stamps on your coffee card gets you a free latte. </p><p>   But his motive is more interesting: Thanos believes that the universe is overpopulated and that killing half of its creatures will give the other half a better chance to survive. Today's debates over the environment and climate change raise similar issues, though usually in less genocidal form: The biologist Edward O. Wilson argued in his 2016 book \"Half-Earth\" that humanity should restrict itself to half the planet's surface, leaving the rest wild. </p><p>   Is Thanos a ruthless villain or a consistent utilitarian -- or are those the same thing? Does humanity deserve to keep multiplying indefinitely? Like the best myths, the story leaves lingering questions even after it is neatly wrapped up, with the Avengers using time travel to recover the Infinity Stones and reverse Thanos's destruction. The Batman movies offer similarly unsettling ideas about the connection between crime and punishment, while \"Black Panther\" tells a fantastical story about Africa, America and race that is more thoughtful and surprising than most nonfiction discussions of those subjects even try to be. </p><p>   It's doubtful whether any of today's megafranchises have produced works of art that will still be enjoyed centuries from now, the way we continue to return to ancient epics and tragedies. But the enormous popularity of narrative universes shows that no matter how much the world changes, what we need from our stories stays the same. </p><p></p>",
