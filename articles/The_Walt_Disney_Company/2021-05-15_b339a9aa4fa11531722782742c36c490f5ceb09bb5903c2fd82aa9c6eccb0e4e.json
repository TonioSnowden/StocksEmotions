Deservedly so.&#xa0;</p> <p>Led by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f103223-ccca-4509-89c6-21e746de2233\">visionary head coach</a> <strong>Pep Guardiola</strong>, the team has played attractive, high-possession football to capture the English title and earn a place in this season's <strong>Champions League</strong> final, Europe's showpiece match.&#xa0;</p> <p>In football, you get what you pay for. According to Manchester City's latest accounts for last season, the club's wage bill is the highest in English football's top tier, worth a whopping £351.4m, up 11 per cent from a year earlier. Academic research suggests that the best predictor of league position is the amount spent on player salaries.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is the fifth Premier League title since the club was acquired in 2008 by <strong>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan</strong>, the billionaire Abu Dhabi royal. Over the past 13 years, the club has spent over £1bn on players.&#xa0;</p> <p>As covered in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1961ea2-d6c5-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44\">FT Big Read from 2017</a>, the owner's plan to dominate global football reflects a desire to find revenue streams that reach beyond petrochemicals, while improving Abu Dhabi's global standing and prestige. Human rights activists have dubbed the strategy as “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bc48b6-0c8c-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67\">sportswashing</a>.” Rival English club executives privately refer to City as “the nation state.”</p> <p>Regardless of the owner's motives, his deep pockets have enabled City to achieve new feats, even as the coronavirus pandemic led to a 11 per cent reduction of revenues to £478.4m last season and a pre-tax loss of £125.1m.&#xa0;</p> <p>The club swallowed huge financial losses while reinforcing its playing squad with stellar talents like defender <strong>Rúben Diaz</strong>. Meanwhile, steep revenue shortfalls at other English and European rivals led to them pulling back on transfer fees and even cutting wages.</p> <p>City's mega outlay, though, has come under scrutiny. Last year, the club <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1223e3d0-3f15-41b4-9722-2d452e57fd34\">overturned</a> a two-year ban from the Champions League for alleged breaches of so-called Financial Fair Play rules, designed to ensure clubs spend within their means. A Premier League investigation into past alleged FFP breaches at City is ongoing.</p> <p>As for last season's losses, <strong>Uefa</strong>, European football's governing body, has signalled the extraordinary circumstances created by the pandemic means FFP rules may be applied judiciously. For that reason, City is “confident” its recent accounts will pass muster.&#xa0;</p> <p>It would be churlish to not recognise that City has spent wisely. Over recent years, the club has built a state of the art training facility, invested heavily in its youth academy and scouting systems, and acquired other teams worldwide to enhance City's global branding. In Guardiola, the club possesses a generational leader who is revolutionising the game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both on and off the pitch, City are playing a different game to their rivals.</p> <p><em>Read Simon Kuper's “Person in the News” profile of Pep Guardiola </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4abd44d8-d418-429f-b830-7336921d73a1\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Triple Crown nightmare imperils $26.1bn US horseracing industry</h1> <p>The $26.1bn US horseracing industry is embroiled in a drugs crisis.</p> <p>In March last year, the country's Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-charges-27-defendants-racehorse-doping-rings\">unsealed indictments</a> against more than two dozen trainers in a massive thoroughbred doping ring, the largest ever crackdown of its kind.&#xa0;</p> <p>Four days later, the board of the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/horse-racing-has-outlived-its-time/2020/03/12/5dd48e46-6476-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html\">published a searing editorial</a> calling for a permanent end to horseracing, which it called “a sport that has outlived its time”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Though those events were soon overshadowed by the pandemic, the issue of anti-doping regulation in horseracing gained new urgency this week after <strong>Kentucky Derby</strong> winner <strong>Medina Spirit</strong> tested positive for a banned substance.&#xa0;</p> <p>That discovery threatens to derail American horseracing's most prestigious set of races, known as the <strong>Triple Crown,</strong> made up of the Kentucky Derby, <strong>Preakness Stakes</strong> and <strong>Belmont Stakes</strong>.</p> <p>As of Friday, Medina Spirit is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/31427412/medina-spirit-race-preakness-stakes-bob-baffert-lawyer-says\">entered into today's</a> Preakness in Baltimore, Maryland, as a second sample awaits follow-up testing for betamethasone. How the horse and its trainer <strong>Bob Baffert</strong> are permitted to continue their bid for a Triple Crown illustrate the quirks of the still-unregulated system.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reform is coming. A bipartisan coalition in US Congress passed the <strong>Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act </strong>in December, paving the way for a newly formed authority to oversee the 38 disparate racing jurisdictions across the country and unify their safety and antidoping rules.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.paulickreport.com/news/the-biz/hisa-committee-announces-board-standing-members-of-horseracing-integrity-and-safety-authority/\">Board members</a> for the <strong>Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority</strong> were only named at the beginning of May. The group has until July 2022 to codify safety and antidoping rules — to be undertaken by the <strong>US Anti-Doping Agency</strong> — and submit them for oversight approval by the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>.</p> <p>But the current lack of interstate regulation means a horse can face sanctions in Kentucky and still be eligible to race in Maryland, as is the case for Medina Spirit. One individual involved in the ongoing reform process told Scoreboard that this year's Triple Crown crisis is “the exact scenario we've talked about with the industry for 10 years”.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Shawn Smeallie</strong>, executive director of the <strong>Coalition for Horse Racing Integrity</strong>, said that in addition to underlying safety concerns, there is financial risk for not fixing thoroughbred racing. A case like Medina Spirit can “create a lack of trust in the product” particularly for US sports punters, who increasingly have more options for wagering.</p> <p>The handle, or total amount bet, declined at each of last year's Triple Crown races. <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/historic-preakness-like-derby-and-belmont-sees-sharp-drop-in-handle/\">Wagers on the Preakness alone</a> fell by half to just $51.2m. Stewards of the sport have very little time to waste.</p> <h1>From laundering to ‘ghost matches', sports corruption grows in pandemic</h1> <p>The economic devastation of the coronavirus pandemic is creating new opportunities for organised criminals to distort sporting events into an ugly form of competition.</p> <p><strong>Europol</strong>, the EU's law enforcement agency, has published a series of reports over the past year warning that the fragile finances of leagues and teams are a vulnerability waiting to be exploited.</p> <p>“We have entire sectors that are now in desperate need of capital injections,” <strong>Pedro Felicio</strong>, head of operations at Europol's <strong>European Financial and Economic Crime Centre</strong> told Scoreboard.&#xa0;</p> <p>“You have thousands of criminal organisations that have billions of euros parked in offshores all over the world, and they just need a little excuse, opportunity to invest, to buy these companies, clubs, betting operators,” he warned. “They have the money to do that.”</p> <p>Betting-related match fixing generates €120m in net winnings for criminals every year, according to <strong>Sportradar, </strong>a company that collects data for leagues. Youth games, friendlies and matches in lower-level leagues are at higher risk of infiltration.</p> <p>Many sports leagues and teams are vulnerable, struggling after more than a year without selling tickets to fans. Sponsors are guarding their budgets carefully, adding to the strain.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's not all about profiting through a big bet on a rigged game, cautioned Felicio. Simply laundering the cash through sports teams is appealing. He warned that authorities must be “vigilant” during club takeovers in particular.</p> <p>Since the pandemic, criminals have also adopted new techniques to launder cash. The ruse becomes especially hard to detect for enforcement agencies when the criminals own betting operators or clubs.</p> <p>This level of control allows criminals to create so-called “ghost matches,” fake fixtures created entirely for the purposes rigged gambling markets. Europol believes this is also commonplace in esports, or competitive video gaming, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7cd1092-aec6-484f-a2f7-114b52c9ff9c\">fast-growing industry</a> attracting investment from traditional sports teams and leagues.</p> <p>“Basically they invent a competition altogether,” said Felicio. “Sometimes they will even invent the names of teams that do not even exist.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The matches might not exist, but the crimes are very real.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>It was a busy week in European football.
