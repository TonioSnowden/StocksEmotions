On Friday, the government reported that just 235,000 jobs were created last month, which was far below economists' expectations.</p><p>Other clues, meanwhile, have suggested the virus was a smaller factor in the latest monthly jobs data.</p><p>Read:Delta blamed for poor jobs report, but too few people willing to work might be a bigger problem</p>",
