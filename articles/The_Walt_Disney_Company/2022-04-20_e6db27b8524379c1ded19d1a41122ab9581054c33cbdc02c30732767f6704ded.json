  "text": "<p>Netflix's decade-long run of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70a28358-8720-4f36-a5b4-24dc0f3be9a3\">subscriber growth ended</a> in the first quarter and the streaming pioneer admitted worse was to come in the current quarter, triggering a share price drop.</p> <p>The company said subscriber numbers dropped by about 200,000 between January and March, and shocked investors by predicting that number would balloon in the current quarter to about 2mn. </p> <p>Netflix blamed the dramatic slowdown in part on saturation in its biggest markets. It also acknowledged the impact of competition from streaming services launched by traditional media groups such as Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount. </p> <p>Price rises in the US and Canada cost the company about 600,000 subscribers although it said the strategy had been “significantly revenue positive”. It also quit streaming in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, costing it about 700,000 subscribers.</p> <p>Netflix said it would try to address the slowing growth by improving the “quality of our programming” and by seeking to charge some of the 100mn households that share other users' accounts.</p> <p>It also planned to launch an ad-supported streaming service — an idea that he had long resisted, co-chief executive Reed Hastings said.</p> <p>Netflix shares fell by a quarter in after-market trading, suggesting as much as $40bn could be wiped off the company's valuation when the stock market opens later today. The falls are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b63a57-0d46-41c7-8f6b-c61d388db039\">helping to drag down</a> Nasdaq 100 futures contracts and the S&amp;P 500 index.</p> <p>“This was a change in tone”, said Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz who studies the company. </p> <p>Shares in the company, which was one of the big winners from the pandemic, have fallen 40 per cent since the start of the year and 60 per cent since their peak in November.</p> <p><em>Do you think that Netflix's best times are behind it?
