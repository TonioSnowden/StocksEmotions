  "text": "<p>From the archive: Here's what Wall Street analysts see for the U.S. stock market in 2022</p><p>The bank is still banging that drum. \"With strong labor markets, tightening policy, a flat curve, and our economists forecasting slower global growth with a downside skew, we think that a 'late-cycle' flavor to the market continues, supporting light overall positioning and a premium for portfolio defense/diversification,\" say the strategists led by Andrew Sheets.</p><p>In practice, that means Morgan Stanley expects the S&amp;P 500 SPX to keep falling, to 3,900 by the second quarter of 2023, though it's more optimistic elsewhere. Its top trade recommendation is being long Japanese equities, as the firm says recent currency weakness should boost Japanese corporate earnings.</p><p>The weakness in both the U.K. and Australian currencies, as well as the commodity rally, also makes them optimistic toward U.K. and Australian stocks. In the U.S. , the firm likes the defensive sectors of healthcare and utilities. In commodities, Morgan Stanley prefers oil over gold, as it sees $130 per barrel Brent BRN00 by the third quarter, and aluminum over copper.</p><p>Probably the most useful graphic the firm provided was this cartoon:</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The key inflation report is due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect the year-over-year rate for the consumer price index to recede to 8.1% from a four-decade high of 8.5%. Investors may place more attention on the core reading, which on a monthly basis is expected to tick higher to 0.4%.</p><p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said she expects the central bank's asset purchase program will end \"early\" in the third quarter, and that the first rate hike could come as early as a few weeks afterwards. The ECB's governing council has a meeting on July 21.</p><p>Coinbase COIN shares skidded 18% in premarket trade as the crypto trading app reported worse-than-forecast revenue on declining volume. Also in the crypto space, the so-called algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD fell as low as 30 cents on the dollar.</p><p>Unity Software U shares plunged on weak guidance. The day's big earnings report, from Walt Disney DIS, comes after the close of trading.</p><p>Swedish Match SE:SWMA recommended a $16 billion cash offer from Philip Morris International PM.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Markets were in an upbeat mood, with stock futures ES00 NQ00 advancing ahead of the CPI report.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was 2.94%.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>Here were the most active stock market tickers as of 6 a.m. Eastern on MarketWatch. </p><p> Ticker   Security name  TSLA     Tesla  GME      GameStop  AMC      AMC Entertainment  NIO      Nio  COIN     Coinbase Global  AAPL     Apple  AMZN     Amazon.com  NVDA     Nvidia  UPST     Upstart Holdings  BABA     Alibaba</p><p>Random reads</p><p>The 'Wagatha Christie' feud — a spat between the wives of two English soccer players —gets its day in court.</p><p>This woman purchased an asset with a compound annual growth rate of 8.85%.
