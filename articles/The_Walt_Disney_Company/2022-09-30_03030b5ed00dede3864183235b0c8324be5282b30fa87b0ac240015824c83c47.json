  "title": "The Old Man, Disney Plus review — Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow are stellar leads in new thriller",
  "text": "<p>Roger Murtaugh was only 50 when he famously announced that he was “too old for this shit” in <em>Lethal Weapon</em>. But he's a veritable rookie compared to some of the grizzled stars — from Liam Neeson to Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington — who have helped create the “geriatric thriller” sub-genre.</p> <p>Joining their ranks now is seventysomething Jeff Bridges, who stars in a new seven-episode series which makes no bones about its protagonist's advanced age. <em>The Old Man</em>, streaming on Disney Plus, is not some brash, brazen showcase of undiminished virility. Though set against the backdrop of espionage, black ops and mercenarism, the story it tells is a largely contemplative one about how the present invariably comes to be contaminated by the past.</p> <p>The series unfolds at a deliberate pace from the opening sequence which introduces us to the title character — a seemingly unremarkable, solitary individual who struggles to put on his socks in the mornings and is troubled by a frequent urge to go to the bathroom at night. </p> <p>It's an image of ordinariness that Dan Chase (Bridges) has cultivated for years, up until the moment that he spots, and summarily kills, an intruder in his home. Calling the police, he tells them he's an estate agent acting in self-defence. But estate agents don't tend to have cash, confidential documents and assassin-grade guns stashed under the floorboards. </p> <p>His identity as a former CIA operative gone rogue now exposed, Chase suddenly finds himself subjected to nominative determinism. But just as the FBI closes in on him, Chase receives a tip off from an unlikely source — an assistant director at the Bureau called Harold Harper (John Lithgow), who knew him from when the two were stationed in Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p> <p>Gradually the story behind why Chase is being pursued and why Harper is so anxious to assist him in disappearing again is pieced together (partially through flashbacks). But the plot is arguably secondary to the stellar leads; they help the show transcend its genre trappings with textured performances which hint at depths of their characters' regret for what they were once — and still are — capable of.</p> <p><em>The Old Man</em> may at times be too slow to be truly gripping, but Bridges in particular keeps us transfixed. His Chase is no idealised hero, but he is imbued with a rich, lived-in humanity. To see him forge a relationship with Zoe (Amy Brenneman) while on the run, and comfort her in a moment of personal crisis is every bit as riveting as one of the bruising action sequences.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>Episodes one and two on Disney Plus now; new episodes released weekly on Wednesdays.
