  "text": "<p>The records show that Chris Cuomo gave detailed feedback on his brother's statements to the press and gathered information about upcoming stories involving his brother's accusers.</p><p>In a statement, CNN, a unit of AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia, said that \"thousands of pages of additional transcripts and exhibits\" released by Ms. James's office \"deserve a thorough review and consideration.\"</p><p>\"We will be having conversations and seeking additional clarity about their significance as they relate to CNN over the next several days,\" the CNN statement said.</p><p>Andrew Cuomo stepped down as governor of New York earlier this year after Ms. James's office released its report, though he said that some of the allegations against him had no factual basis.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Chris Cuomo referred to CNN's Monday statement. A spokesman for Andrew Cuomo said that aspects of Ms. James's investigation into the former governor were politically motivated.</p><p>\"Today's manipulated release of hand picked witness testimony with selective redactions is typical,\" the statement said.</p><p>CNN President Jeff Zucker said in an employee meeting in May that Chris Cuomo had \"made a mistake\" by participating in strategy sessions with his brother, but said he didn't see a point in suspending Chris Cuomo, adding that taking him off the air would amount to \"punishment for the sake of punishing.\"</p><p>In September, Chris Cuomo was accused of groping a veteran TV journalist at a party in 2005 when they were co-workers at Walt Disney Co.'s ABC News. Chris Cuomo responded by saying he regretted the incident, which he said wasn't sexual in nature. CNN had no additional comment at the time.</p><p>The records released Monday by Ms. James's office provide the most detailed look to date of Chris Cuomo's attempts to guide his brother, including an interview with state investigators where the CNN anchor said he reached out to sources—including other journalists—to figure out whether additional complaints of sexual misconduct against his brother might surface.</p><p>Andrew Cuomo has been accused by several women, including some that worked for him, of sexual misconduct that included inappropriate touching and lewd remarks. Ms. James's report, which was released over the summer, said that Andrew Cuomo grabbed the breast of an executive assistant; caressed the neck, back and belly of a state trooper; squeezed the rear end of another employee; inappropriately touched two other women, and over the years, made a habit of hugging and kissing staff members to their discomfort. Andrew Cuomo has said he never touched anybody inappropriately.</p><p>Chris Cuomo said during the interview with investigators that he didn't conduct opposition research on the women who accused his brother of misconduct and said he made inquiries only at the request of his brother's advisers.</p><p>The records include text messages between Chris Cuomo and Melissa DeRosa, who was then one of his brother's top aides. Chris Cuomo suggests possible statements to the press in the aftermath of stories about sexual misconduct involving Andrew Cuomo, at one point annotating his brother's response in detail. In another text, Chris Cuomo told Ms. DeRosa that he had information.</p><p>\"I have a lead on the wedding girl,\" Chris Cuomo texted Ms. DeRosa on March 4. The text came days after the New York Times published an article that included an interview from a woman who accused Andrew Cuomo of inappropriate touching at a 2019 wedding reception. It couldn't be learned whether Chris Cuomo's text referred to that article.</p><p>Throughout the interview with investigators, Chris Cuomo said that he was only peripherally involved in his brother's response to the allegations, adding that Andrew Cuomo's advisers had relationships with the press.</p><p>\"There is no division between politics and media,\" Chris Cuomo said, according to the transcript. \"We all know each other.\"</p><p>Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com</p><p>CNN to Review Records Showing Chris Cuomo's Involvement in Coaching Brother</p>",
