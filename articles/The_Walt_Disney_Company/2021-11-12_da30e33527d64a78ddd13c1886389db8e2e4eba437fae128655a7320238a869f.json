  "text": "<p>On Thursday, however, there was evidence that investors were again taking pricing pressures in stride. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 added 2.56 points, or 0.1%, to 4649.27, reversing direction after finishing Wednesday with its largest one-day decline in more than a month. The Nasdaq Composite gained 81.58 points, or 0.5%, to 15704.28.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 158.71 points, or 0.4%, to 35921.23. The blue-chip index was pulled down, in part, by Walt Disney's worst daily performance in more than a year.</p><p>Shares of growth and technology companies, which tend to perform poorly in an inflationary environment, helped push the S&amp;P and Nasdaq higher. Advanced Micro Devices gained $6.14, or 4.4%, to $146.01. Nvidia added $9.31, or 3.2%, to $303.90. Netflix rose 410.67, or 1.7%, to $657.58.</p><p>Financial companies, which tend to benefit from higher interest rates, also rallied. Energy and materials stocks posted strong performances, too. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks rose 0.8%.</p><p>Wednesday's slide following the inflation data was a \"well-deserved pullback\" after an autumn stock-market rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 to a stretch of repeated records, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. \"Economic growth is still quite solid, and that's going to drive longer-term stock-market gains. We think the underlying fundamentals that got us here are still in place, and that's what investors need to keep in mind.\"</p><p>Even as pricing pressures remain top of mind for strategists and investors, many say they have a bullish outlook for the rest of the year.</p><p>Stocks are coming out of a strong earnings season, during which about 81% of reporting S&amp;P 500 companies beat earnings expectations, according to FactSet data through Thursday morning.</p><p>Investors say commentary in recent earnings calls gave them confidence that many companies can navigate inflationary pressures.</p><p>In corporate news, Rivian Automotive jumped by $22.26, or 22%, to $122.99. The electric-vehicle startup made its public debut Wednesday, closing at $100.73, well above the $78 initial offering price.</p><p>Tesla lost $4.44, or 0.4%, to $1,063.51. Regulatory filings showed Elon Musk sold about $5 billion of shares in the auto maker this week. Twitter users directed the chief executive to sell 10% of his stake in the company in an online poll last weekend.</p><p>The U.S. bond market was closed for Veterans Day.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.3% to a record.</p><p>Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 1.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.5% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.1%.
