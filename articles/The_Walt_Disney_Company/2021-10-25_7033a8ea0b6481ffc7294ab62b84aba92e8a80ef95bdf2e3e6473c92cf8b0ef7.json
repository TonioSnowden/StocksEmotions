  "text": "<p>\"It's a great opportunity for me to explore issues that may be too taboo for other media outlets,\" Ms. Williams said in an interview Monday.</p><p>She said the Daily Wire reached out to her shortly after learning of her departure from ESPN. The details regarding her role and project are still being worked out, she said. She declined to discuss contract details.</p><p>Ms. Williams, who worked as a sideline college football and basketball reporter for ESPN, refused to get the Covid-19 vaccine over what she said were fertility concerns. Scientists have identified no known links between the shots and pregnancy complications, and doctors say they are struggling to promote vaccinations among the many women who share Ms. Williams's concerns.</p><p>She has said that leaving ESPN was one of the most difficult decisions of her career and that people shouldn't be forced to choose between their livelihoods and the freedom to make their own healthcare choices, calling it un-American.</p><p>\"I am proud to be a part of a company that fights for our rights and I cannot wait to bring agenda-free sports reporting to the Daily Wire's members and millions of followers,\" Ms. Williams said in a statement published Friday by the Daily Wire, adding that she was \"thrilled and honored\" to join the publication.</p><p>ESPN has had a vaccine mandate for employees who travel to stadiums since August, and its parent company, Walt Disney Co., now requires all nonunion employees be vaccinated. While the sports network said it provides accommodations for some people, it said previously that it didn't accommodate Ms. Williams in part because she travels to stadiums that often have their own vaccine mandates.</p><p>ESPN on Monday had no comment on Ms. Williams's latest move.</p><p>In an earlier interview with the Journal, Ms. Williams, 37 years old, said she wants a second child and is concerned that vaccination might affect her fertility or pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there is no known link between Covid-19 shots and fertility problems or miscarriage and has urged women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to get pregnant to get inoculated.</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com</p><p>Former ESPN Reporter Allison Williams Who Left Over Vaccine Mandate Joins the Daily Wire</p>",
