  "title": "Disney to Develop Residential Communities With Condos, Houses; First project will be a community in California's Coachella Valley surrounding a 24-acre lagoon",
  "text": "<p>Disney has found success beyond its theme-park business in other segments, including its cruise line, and aims to build on that by developing residential communities, Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said in a promotional video.</p><p>\"While we're known most for our theme-park experiences, we've built an incredible legacy of going beyond the parks,\" he said.</p><p>Disney said the Rancho Mirage community is being developed in collaboration with Scottsdale, Ariz.-based DMB Development and will be called Cotino.</p><p>Disney didn't provide details about the projected cost of the project or the properties within Cotino, or when it would open the development for reservations.</p><p>Cotino will include at least one section expressly for residents 55-years-old and above, the company said. Home buyers will be able to choose from estates, single-family homes and condominiums.</p><p>Per the site approval, the community is expected to surround a roughly 24-acre lagoon built sustainably with low water consumption and minimal energy usage, Disney said.</p><p>Residents will be able to get a membership that provides access to a waterfront clubhouse, a club-only beach area and recreational water activities, as well as Disney programming, entertainment and activities throughout the year.</p><p>The development also has plan approval for a mixed-use district that can host shopping, dining and entertainment venues as well as a beachfront hotel and a beach park with recreational activities that can be accessed by a day pass.</p><p>Other locations across the U.S. are under consideration for future development, Disney said.</p><p>Disney, for years already, has sold luxury vacation homes through its 980-acre gated Golden Oak community in Florida.</p><p>In the 1990s, Disney developed a 5,000-acre residential community in Florida known as Celebration, which was located near Walt Disney World in Orlando. It featured architecture by Michael Graves and Robert A.M. Stern, who had previously designed buildings for the company's theme parks and corporate campuses. Disney later divested most of its interest in Celebration.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Disney to Develop Residential Communities With Condos, Houses</p>",
