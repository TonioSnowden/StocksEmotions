  "text": "<p>A “substantial majority” of US Federal Reserve officials back <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/422c0466-94e4-4d89-85e3-b1006a0d3feb\">slowing down the pace of interest rate rises</a> soon, while some warned of greater than expected monetary policy tightening next year, according to an account of their most recent meeting. </p> <p>The Fed was “primed, ready, anxious, to slow the pace of hiking because they still believe <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b499ba3b-65db-4678-a99b-0fcd209178f9\">they can slow inflation</a> without creating a recession and increasing unemployment”, said Steven Blitz, chief US economist at TS Lombard, who nonetheless expected a 0.75 percentage point rise in December. The Fed “will rue the day if they don't”, he added.</p> <p>US markets are closed for Thanksgiving today, with Wall Street's benchmark S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite having ended the previous session 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent higher, respectively.
