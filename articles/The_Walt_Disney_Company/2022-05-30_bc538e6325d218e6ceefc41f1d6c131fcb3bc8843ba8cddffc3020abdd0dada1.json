  "text": "<p>Hey Fintech Fam!</p> <p>It's Memorial Day in the US, which is considered the unofficial start of summer and the kick-off of this year's wedding season, which is expected to be the busiest in decades. (I went to two weddings in two different states last week and I'm still recovering.)</p> <p>The boom in new unions might be mirrored in the fintech sector, where my sources have been predicting a surge of dealmaking in the coming months as fintech valuations come crashing back to earth from their peak in October. In this week's newsletter we have an exclusive interview with the CEO of one of Asia's fastest-growing fintechs on the hunt for deals. Further down we have an interview with a Disney executive turned fintech CEO who explains why content creation is becoming increasingly important to fintech.</p> <p>Which fintech tie-ups do you see happening by the end of the year? Reach out to me (<a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=imani.moise@ft.com\">imani.moise@ft.com</a>) or Sid (<a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=sid.v@ft.com\">sid.v@ft.com</a>) to let us know. Happy reading!</p> <h1>Singapore fintech group marries payments with ecommerce</h1> <p>Shailesh Naik, chief executive of Singaporean fintech MatchMove, is planning a string of acquisitions to extend the global reach of his embedded finance group as fintechs continue to blur the lines between financial services and retail.</p> <p>The company acquired ecommerce platform Shopmatic last week in a $200mn deal that combines MatchMove's banking-as-a-service platform with a small business ecommerce firm that bills itself as the Shopify for Asia's emerging markets.</p> <p>“By following [ecommerce capabilities] with financial services we help the local economy and also we keep more of the economy moving on our platforms,” he said “That's why we've seen companies like Amazon try over and over to introduce payments and financial services. It's an inevitable trend.”</p> <p>Only 60 per cent of workers in south-east Asia are estimated to have bank accounts, Naik said, but ecommerce in the region is growing quickly as more consumers gain access to the financial system.</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of digitally connected consumers in Asia-Pacific have used a digital wallet to shop in stores or online in the past 12 months, according to Euromonitor's Digital Survey 2021. The region was already the largest ecommerce market in the world in 2020, comprising 48 per cent of global online sales, according to recent data from the research firm. The retail market has the potential to grow by more than $68.5bn in additional ecommerce sales by 2025.</p> <p>Digitising small businesses in emerging markets also has big implications for global corporations, said Shopmatic CEO Anurag Avula. A multinational consumer company such as Unilever currently has very little real-time insight into how their products sell at small storefronts in India, for example. But once more small and medium-sized firms have ecommerce capabilities, they can track the lifecycle of their goods from the factory&#xa0;to the consumer. “The power of the data that becomes available is huge,” Avula said. </p> <p>The growth potential for payments in emerging markets has been talked about for years but few firms have been successful. PayPal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/paypal-is-shutting-down-domestic-payments-business-in-india/\">shut down</a> its domestic Indian operations last year.</p> <p>“PayPal actually is a great solution, but it's not built for you wanting to get a customer who's sitting miles away from a small village in India,” said Avula, who used to oversee PayPal's Asian operations.</p> <p>The key to scaling, said Naik, is being brandless and joining forces with companies on the ground in markets that have already established trust with local consumers and regulators. That's why the company is seeking to buy what it calls “mini-MatchMoves” in markets in central Europe, Latin America and the US, he said.</p> <p>“We have operations across all of Asia, using the same platform at its core, but when it meets the consumer . . . it's in the local language.”</p> <p>Personalising the shopping experience to various customer segments in Asia-Pacific will be essential to staying relevant in the increasingly digital space, Euromonitor analysts said in another report.</p> <p>Though Naik admits there's “nothing at all” to stop incumbents in the payment space from replicating their model, “the disadvantage they have is that we already have a five-year head start,” he said.</p> <h1>Fintech fascination</h1> <p><strong>Klarna Kuts </strong>Swedish “buy now, pay later” provider Klarna <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a184a14-230e-4a94-acf7-d919f1dc039b\">cut 10 per cent</a> of its workforce last week, and its CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the FT that the company would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b7d26c-2407-4845-8276-ef5da20f778a\">deemphasise growth</a> to focus on short-term profitability, as recession fears weigh on fintech valuations. The shift in focus follows BNPL rival Affirm's statement this month that it plans to be profitable on an operating basis by next summer.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan chases growth&#xa0;</strong>While fintechs like Klarna are tightening their belts, JPMorgan told investors last week that it expects to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0814e78-edaf-474c-ba42-693a23056732\">lose up to $1bn</a> over the next few years on its new digital consumer bank in the UK. Investors have already expressed concerns over the US banking giant's spending plans, but JPM's “fortress” balance sheet and $48bn in annual profits give a longer leash than its fintech challengers. The bank does not expect the business to break even until 2027. </p> <p><strong>Nigeria's&#xa0;retail banking renaissance </strong>Fintech deals dominated fundraising activity in Africa's largest economy last year, with deals in the sector accounting for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b72d1cf-23f3-4384-8afc-019c6b149258\">38 per cent of overall deal volume</a>. Growth in consumer banking, historically a very small part of the Nigerian financial services sector, has fuelled the growth as technology makes it easier to determine creditworthiness in traditionally underbanked communities. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Bonus podcast</strong> Listen to Money Clinic's Claer Barrett interview two young investors who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a561a90-b77d-4b9f-a2bd-7587b2b12aa6\">lost significant sums of money</a> in the recent crypto crash.</p> <h1>Quick Fire Q&amp;A</h1> <p>For this week's newsletter, I interviewed George Leimer, CEO of Rally, a five-year-old trading platform that turns collectibles such as baseball cards, Lamborghinis and yes, NFTs, into fractional securities that can be purchased for as little as $10. The company's unusual approach to defining financial assets has attracted $109mn from a diverse group of investors including Wheelhouse 360 Partners, which does not traditionally invest in fintechs. Rally's “unique combination of consumer demand for nostalgia and financial returns,” made it an attractive bet, chief investment officer Ann Berry told me. </p> <p><strong>How did you get started?</strong> The genesis of the idea was that information about assets and investing was becoming more accessible every day. There were more and more items that individuals were starting to consider as investments . . . but couldn't because the value of those items was often way, way, way more than a single person can afford. A normal person can't afford a Lamborghini. So the idea was born to turn these items into actual fractional securities — they're qualified by the SEC — and create a financial market around those securities.</p> <p><strong>What is the revenue model?</strong> We make money with an underwriting fee when we create a security and do an initial offering. We make money in our merchandising business, we create a lot of interesting collectible one of a kind items that are commemorative of our offerings, and we sell those along with the offerings. Those are the two main ways we make money today.</p> <p><strong>Where does the inventory come from?</strong> We have a team that identifies assets that would be suitable for the platform. We get submissions from people for items that they want to put on the platform and that they want to securitise and our asset acquisition team handles all of that stuff. We take the item, we create the security around it, and then we have a vault where those items are secured and stored and there's insurance around those items in the vault.</p> <p><strong>Who is your target demographic? </strong>The majority of the folks on our platform are people between the ages of 25 and 35, who are who are at the beginning of their journey as investors overall. They have passionate fandom about one or more collectible areas. They want to identify themselves by being invested and participating in these things. But again, they don't have the money to own these things outright. That's why Rally is attractive to them, both for the ability to access the item and for the ability to talk about the fact that they're involved in the item.</p> <p><strong>What feedback have you got from your user base? </strong>The things that everyone asks for when we do user interviews are more data and more education and more content. Part of what makes these assets objects of passion for people are the stories about the assets. So people want to hear those things: What is this asset? Why is it important? Where did it come from? How did you guys get it? Who owned it? etc. So we're going to do a lot with content in general, education being one and storytelling being the other. What Wheelhouse specialises in is storytelling in a way that is fun and compelling. So, to us, the synergy was obvious. </p><p>Source: Imani Moise 2022 'Payments and ecommerce tie the knot' FT.com 30 May.
