  "text": "<p>   As the streaming landscape keeps getting more crowded, a new entrant is looking to help declutter it. </p><p>   Struum, a streaming service co-founded by former Discovery Inc. and Walt Disney Co. executives, won't offer its own slate of original programming when it launches this spring. Instead, it will aim to give customers a-la-carte access to all content from hundreds of niche streaming services, offering users a way to stream individual shows and movies from various platforms without having to subscribe to each plan separately. </p><p>   Co-founder Paul Pastor said Struum would give more visibility to lesser-known services, which he said have \"fantastic content\" but have trouble \"being part of someone's daily habit,\" because there is only so much money households will spend on streaming. </p><p>   The pandemic has been a boon for major streaming services, including Netflix, Disney's Hulu and Amazon's Prime Video, whose subscriber base soared as people were shut in. </p><p>   Former Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner's Tornante Co. is Struum's main backer. </p><p>   Struum declined to name any of the services whose content would be available on its platform at launch, but said it has already struck deals with nearly three dozen services -- accounting for more than 20,000 TV series, movies and shorts. </p><p></p>",
