  "title": "Technology:  CAA Completes Deal  For Rival Agency ICM  ----  By Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>   Creative Artists Agency completed its acquisition of ICM Partners, a deal that combines two of the entertainment industry's biggest agencies at a time of tremendous change in the media landscape. </p><p>   The deal is valued at $750 million, according to a person familiar with the terms of the transaction. </p><p>   The combination of two of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies is being driven in large part by the consolidation of the entertainment industry over the past several years. </p><p>   As companies such as Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. grow in stature in the entertainment space, the talent agencies representing actors, writers and producers are seeking strength through size as well. </p><p>   CAA's leadership said in a statement the acquisition will position the agency to better deliver for its client base. </p><p>   CAA's talent roster includes stars such as Tom Hanks, Reese Witherspoon, director Steven Spielberg and producer Ryan Murphy. </p><p>   ICM clients include TV writers and producers Shonda Rhimes and Bill Lawrence, director Spike Lee and comedian Chris Rock. </p><p>   As a result of the ICM deal, CAA will now have an enterprise value of $5 billion, the person familiar with the two firms said. The deal will see CAA add 425 ICM staffers to its ranks, giving the firm more than 3,200 employees. Another 105 ICM employees won't join CAA, the person said. </p><p>   All of the major Hollywood talent agencies have been looking for new paths toward growth. Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., parent of the largest talent agency, WME, has expanded into a range of other businesses by acquiring the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the sports betting firm OpenBet. </p><p>   United Talent Agency has also expanded through acquisitions including a deal earlier this month to acquire Curtis Brown Group, the British literary agency. </p><p></p>",
