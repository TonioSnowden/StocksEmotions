  "text": "<p>\"Advertising, when executed thoughtfully and elegantly, is a powerful way to lower prices for everyone,\" said WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar, who previously led rival streaming service Hulu.</p><p>The telecom giant has yet to disclose the price of the new service, which is expected to cost less than the $15 monthly price of ad-free HBO Max so that it can appeal to a wider pool of potential customers.</p><p>HBO gained a reputation for critically praised TV series sold through cable providers. Its online cousin went to market last year with a cache of added content from Warner Bros. studios and new licensing deals. The service was designed to adapt the brand for a streaming-media boom dominated by cheaper services like Netflix and Disney+.</p>",
