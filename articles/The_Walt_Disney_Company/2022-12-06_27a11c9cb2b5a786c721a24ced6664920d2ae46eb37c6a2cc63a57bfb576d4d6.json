  "title": "'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio' Review: A Fairy Tale Amid Fascism; The Oscar-winning Mexican director sets the story of the wooden boy in 1930s Italy in this bittersweet animated film.",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Netflix</p><p>But for all its anti-traditionalist, antifascist and maybe even anti-Disney attitude, what \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" leaves on one's palate is sweetness—bittersweetness, at times, though the stop-motion film is melancholic and sentimental without being cloying; goofy but intelligent; enchantingly musical and moralistic without preachments. It is also a paean to the love of fathers and sons: The puppeteer Geppetto is, after all, Pinocchio's father, though it takes the old man a while to let that sink in.</p><p>Co-directed with Mark Gustafson and far more faithful to the 1883 Carlo Collodi book than the 1940 Disney movie ever was, the Del Toro-Patrick McHale screenplay presents a Geppetto in mourning. During World War I, planes accidentally drop their payload on his alpine Italian town, bombing the village church just as Geppetto's beloved son, Carlo, runs back in to retrieve his \"perfect\" pinecone. Driven to drink, Geppetto (David Bradley, of \"Harry Potter\" fame) goes into a stark if very slow decline and years later, still in a furious rage, he hacks the offending tree to pieces. Using the trunk—which has, by happenstance, become the home of our narrator, Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor)—he fashions a wooden marionette that in his stupor he imagines to be Carlo. As happens in all \"Pinocchios,\" the Blue Fairy answers Geppetto's plea for the \"boy\" to come to life, which he does, to numerous adventures in cruelty, brutality, self-sacrifice and love.</p><p>The incongruously English-accented Pinocchio (Gregory Mann, who also voices Carlo) is no saccharine cartoon character: Parents of children with ADHD might find themselves rendering a similar diagnosis, as the rough-cut puppet arrives in the sentient world knowing nothing, wanting to know everything at once and not waiting for an answer to any of his questions. In one of the more memorable numbers in Alexandre Desplat's score for the film (lyrics by Roeban Katz and Mr. Del Toro) Pinocchio sings, \"What do you call it call it? / What do you do with it with it?\"—the questions being applied to everything in Geppetto's shop as Pinocchio careers around it creating chaos. The initial encounters between Geppetto and his creation are fraught with confusion and anger—from Geppetto at himself for making a Carlo substitute and from the local villagers, after Pinocchio decides to follow Geppetto to church.</p><p>\"Demon!\" \"Abomination!\" \"Witchcraft!\" they cry, while the local fascist magistrate, Podesta (Ron Perlman), asks, \"Who controls you, wooden boy?\" Pinocchio sassily responds, \"Who controls you?!\" only to be muffled by a fearful Geppetto: Mr. Del Toro used the Spanish Civil War as the backdrop of \"Pan's Labyrinth\"; here it's the rise of Italian fascism that casts the shadow, evil and oppression being facilitated by the likes of the local priest (Burn Gorman), Podesta himself and his son, Pinocchio's nemesis Candlewick. (\"A model fascist youth. Perfect teeth. And no signs of jaundice!\") Il Duce—or Il Dolce, as Pinocchio keeps saying—is Mussolini as jaw-jutting half-pint; some may find themselves thinking of Lord Farquaad in \"Shrek.\" That Tom Kenny, of \"SpongeBob SquarePants,\" is Mussolini's voice doesn't make him more dignified.</p><p>But while there is plenty to laugh at in this adaptation of a fantasy classic, what the writers have also delivered is poignancy, the nature of which Collodi might never have dreamed of: the war experiences of Pinocchio and Candlewick (Finn Wolfhard of \"Stranger Things\"), for instance, or Pinocchio's comment after he and Geppetto repair the crucifix in their village's ruined church. \"He's made of wood, too,\" Pinocchio says, looking up. \"Why do they like him and not me?\"</p><p>If \"Ciao Papa\" is a nominee for Best Song next Oscar night, the Academy will have to find a boy soprano like Mr. Mann to do it justice. By the time the lament is sung—and Pinocchio is preparing to save Geppetto from Count Volpe (Christoph Waltz) by rejoining the carnival, where he is tormented by the monkey Spazzatura (Cate Blanchett, spewing simian gibberish)—we know what kind of boy he is. Not one made of the \"flesh and bone and meaty bits\" he claims to have, making his nose grow as long and leafy as an oak branch. Or the boy whom Geppetto can't appreciate until late in the game. But a memorable one, who can tell a chastising Cricket, \"But I don't want to obey!\" and not really inspire any argument why he should.</p><p>Mr. Anderson is the Journal's TV critic.</p><p>'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio' Review: A Fairy Tale Amid Fascism</p>",
