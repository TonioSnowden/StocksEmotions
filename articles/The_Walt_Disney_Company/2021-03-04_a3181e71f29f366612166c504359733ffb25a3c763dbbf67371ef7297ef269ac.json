Heywood was co-head of <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s UK investment banking division from 2003 to 2007, where he worked with Greensill — and for a time took him under his wing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Later, Greensill would sometimes use a <strong>Cabinet Office</strong> pass to “camp” in the economic and domestic secretariat, one of the most powerful parts of the ministry, one official said, adding that his level of access was considered “bizarre”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Greensill was involved in high-profile government work, such as teaming up with fintech company <strong>Taulia</strong>, to help public sector bodies speed up invoice payments. Last year the <strong>British Business Bank</strong> accredited Greensill Capital to provide financing under the government's Covid-19 crisis loans programme, which offers lenders an 80 per cent guarantee.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the words of <strong>Paul Myners</strong>, the former financial services minister, who was asking questions about the Greensill business back in 2019, civil servants and ministers sometimes seemed “bewitched” by the Australian.&#xa0;</p> <p>“There was a failure to ask basic questions about him and how his business had so quickly become a big player in such a significant market,” Lord Myners said.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Apollo rolls the dice on Vegas</h2> <p>America's sports <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9355018-e9e0-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">betting gold rush</a> triggered big deals like <strong>DraftKings</strong>' Spac debut and <strong>Caesars Entertainment</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b776af7-2cb2-43b9-9e23-a12ab5d20aea\">bid</a> for UK bookmaker <strong>William Hill</strong> months before the words “social distancing” were uttered.&#xa0;</p> <p>But <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong>, the late casino tycoon behind <strong>Las Vegas Sands</strong>, who also played a key role in transforming Macau into a gambler's paradise, felt no reason to modernise. He was, after all, the richest man on the Strip, thanks in part to<strong> SoftBank</strong> (yes, them again) — whose $800m purchase of his computer trade show, <strong>Comdex</strong>, helped birth an empire.</p> <p>And he defended that empire vehemently, spending millions lobbying in Washington against the loosening sports betting laws he saw as a threat to more established brick-and-mortar operators like his own.</p> <p>However, since Adelson's passing in February, change has been unfolding at Sands.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company is parting ways with its marquee resort the Venetian — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23a62fa7-ad0b-42a3-a2e6-7dde7774282d\">agreeing to sell</a> its operations to private equity group <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> for $2.25bn and its real estate and land to a lesser-known party, <strong>Vici Properties</strong>, for $4bn. Apollo plans to enter a long-term agreement with Vici to lease the property and land.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a sizeable wager by Apollo, one of the biggest winners of the coronavirus crisis, that Vegas will make a comeback as an epicentre for tourism.</p> <p>Unlike competitors <strong>MGM </strong>and Caesars, who jumped eagerly into the sports betting ring, Sands' business model relies heavily on the city's convention circuit and in-person events.</p> <p>The risk pales in comparison to Apollo's $31bn mega-buyout of <strong>Harrah's Entertainment </strong>(renamed Caesars) from 2008, which ended in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0ed27c6-a2d4-11e7-b797-b61809486fe2\">messy bankruptcy</a>.</p> <p>As Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a11737da-19ac-4270-969f-29870394cade\">explains</a>: “The latest gambit anticipates a realistic economic recovery. But the private equity firm is wise not to bet the house.”</p> <p>Despite the anti-sports betting sentiments of its founder, Apollo has a history of interest in the sector — most recently acquiring <strong>Great Canadian Gaming </strong>for $2.5bn and Italian sports-betting group <strong>Gamenet</strong>. It also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ca82f51-4433-46bb-a208-71bafc5b364a\">attempted</a> to buy William Hill before Caesars swooped in.</p> <p>Apollo's next move is anyone's game.</p> <h2>Can London reverse its listing luck?</h2> <p>For the past several years, London has watched foreign stock markets — led by those in the US and China — become home to the most exciting businesses on the planet.</p> <p>This isn't particularly good if you are trying to create a globally competitive market. It's also not fun for UK-based bankers and lawyers who have seen their counterparts in other regions make a killing on IPOs — particularly in the midst of the recent Spac boom.&#xa0;</p> <p>So when <strong>Jonathan Hill </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9e9de26-7f44-41e1-9dd6-3721a52c7d9c\">was tasked</a> by UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> to come up with recommendations to make Britain a more hospitable place for IPOs, it was an opportunity for dealmakers to get their say.</p> <p>As you know, advisers do quite well off fees from transactions, including IPOs. When it comes to Spacs, those fees essentially double because they're usually retained to advise on the listing as well as the takeover deal with a target company.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/independent-review-recommends-reforms-to-uk-listing-rules-to-boost-growth-and-markets\">Lord Hill's recommendations</a> seem to have something for everyone. We detail some of them below for you:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Allowing dual-class share structures for companies admitted to the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>'s “premium” segment for a recommended limit of up to five years, meaning directors will have more sway in certain voting processes.</p></li>  <li><p>Reducing free float requirements from 25 to 15 per cent, meaning founders need to sacrifice fewer shares in order to list.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Easing the restrictions around Spacs, which are considered reverse-mergers under the current rules, which is a potential downside for Spac investors, whose money could be locked in place if they decide they're not on board with the vehicle's chosen target. Lord Hill suggests scrapping that presumption and writing rules that treat shell companies more akin to normal commercial companies.</p></li> </ul> <p>To boil it down —&#xa0;Lord Hill is trying to re-establish a balance between investor protection and pulling in new listings — so company founders will be given greater protection, whether they're listing a blank-cheque vehicle or a promising tech upstart.&#xa0;</p> <p>But not everyone is eager to mess with the regulatory establishment.</p> <p>“Shareholder protections should not be used as a bargaining chip to prove the UK is open for business,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ed0d759-c34f-4f3f-a076-6461093da6a2\">said</a> one big investor.</p> <p>Another large global asset manager emphasised that the current standards for premium listings, including the principle of “one share, one vote”, were “critical”.</p> <p>DD will be watching to see where the UK's<strong> Financial Conduct Authority </strong>leans, as it considers the proposals with a goal to publish new rules by late 2021.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Johnny Skumpija</strong>, a <strong>Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore</strong> partner who helped <strong>Palantir Technologies</strong> go public, is joining<strong> Sidley Austin</strong> as a partner in its capital markets practice.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> chairman <strong>Simon Thompson </strong>will step down within the next year after the mining company's destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred indigenous site in Australia last year. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9667d386-3a80-410f-a44a-a89987c9e9e8\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> has hired <strong>Alfredo Porretti</strong> as its new head of shareholder activism to build up its defence against activist investors, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-activism-hire/update-1-jpmorgan-chase-taps-porretti-to-lead-activism-defense-in-north-america-idUSL2N2L116W\">per Reuters</a>.
