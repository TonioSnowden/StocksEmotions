  "text": "<p>Alexei Navalny, Russian president Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, said on Friday he would end a 24-day hunger strike after he was allowed to see civilian doctors and his followers held protests in his support.</p> <p>In a letter his team posted to Instagram on Friday, the jailed opposition leader said he had “made huge progress” since he first complained of severe back and nerve pain two months ago — even though prison authorities did not give into his demands to let him see a doctor of his choice. </p> <p>Navalny's hunger strike, which his allies said had left his life <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00c08480-8cb7-4e27-a7ef-9e90abd3b2db\">“hanging by a thread”</a>, had become a sticking point in Russia's geopolitical stand-off with the US, which vowed “consequences” for Moscow if he died in prison. </p> <p>His personal doctors had warned that he could die within days because of heightened creatine levels that could bring about kidney failure, as well as potentially fatal levels of potassium that could cause a cardiac arrest at “any moment”.</p> <p>Dozens of western celebrities from Nobel laureate JM Coetzee to Star Wars director JJ Abrams signed a letter to Putin calling for his release, while police arrested nearly 2,000 people who protested in about 100 cities across Russia on Wednesday.</p> <p>In recent days, however, the Kremlin appeared to signal its willingness to de-escalate tensions after it began winding down <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65e2bdb6-6c1d-4033-b677-a07bb34716ae\">a military build-up on the Ukrainian border</a>, took an unusually light touch in policing protests in Moscow, and let Navalny see doctors for the two herniated discs in his back. </p> <p>Navalny had said the prison's refusal to treat him with anything other than ibuprofen and its policy of waking him up every hour each night amounted to “torture”.</p> <p>“Two months ago they sniggered at my requests for medical help, didn't give me any medications and wouldn't let me be sent any. A month ago they laughed in my face when I said things like ‘Can I find out what my diagnosis is?' and ‘Can I see my own medical records?'” Navalny wrote.</p> <p>Navalny had said he would remain on hunger strike until he was able to see doctors of his choice, who regularly petitioned to be allowed into his prison outside Moscow to no avail. But since going on hunger strike, Navalny said he had been treated by two civilian doctors, most recently “right before the protest” by his supporters. He also noted that several people had gone on hunger strike in solidarity with him.</p> <p>“The doctors I completely trust put out a statement yesterday that you and I have achieved enough for me to end the hunger strike,” he wrote.</p><p>Source: Max Seddon in Moscow 2021 'Navalny ends hunger strike after gaining access to civilian doctors' FT.com 23 April.
