  "text": "<p>WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar, who led one of the most radical overhauls in the entertainment industry, plans to exit his post Friday.</p><p>The move comes in advance of WarnerMedia parent company AT&amp;T Inc. and Discovery Inc.'s expected closing of a deal to combine their media assets into a new publicly traded company dubbed Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.</p><p>Mr. Kilar made the announcement in a memo to staff viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"Now is the right time to share with each of you that I will be departing this amazing company as the transaction closes,\" he wrote to staff.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Kilar said he has no immediate plans for his next step. He added that he would continue to focus on technology, storytelling and innovation. \"I'm not going to retire and sit on a beach,\" he said.</p><p>Incoming Warner Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav isn't planning to replace Mr. Kilar, people familiar with his thinking said. Mr. Zaslav and a handful of senior Discovery executives including Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels are expected to take over management within the next week.</p><p>During his nearly two-year tenure leading the Warner Bros. studios and cable channels including HBO, CNN and TNT, Mr. Kilar made moves that shook up both the company and the industry. Most recently, he made the call that CNN Chief Jeff Zucker should step down amid recent controversies at the news network.</p><p>The biggest shift was releasing the entire 2021 slate of Warner Bros. movies on the nascent HBO Max direct-to-consumer streaming service at the same time as introducing them in movie theaters.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook on a new Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. company without Jason Kilar at the helm? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The strategy known as \"Project Popcorn\" had two goals: Feed fresh content to HBO Max to build up its subscriber numbers and get films to the public when most theaters were closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>High-profile directors and agents attacked the decision. They argued that putting the films on HBO Max at the same time as their theatrical release would cheapen the product and damage the movie business.</p><p>\"We took a fair bit of heat for the decision,\" Mr. Kilar said.</p><p>A former Amazon.com executive who also was the founding CEO of Hulu, Mr. Kilar said that if he weren't perceived as an outsider it would have been easier for the creative community to accept.</p><p>\"If I had been here on this lot for 20 years straight and then introduced those changes, a number of folks inside the industry would have reacted differently,\" he said.</p><p>The gamble paid off as HBO and HBO Max now have nearly 73.8 million subscribers, up 20 million from before Mr. Kilar took over in May 2020. Warner Bros. since has resumed putting movies into theaters first—as the pandemic abates and they reopen—adopting a 45-day theatrical window before they land on HBO Max, which now has its own large slate of original movies and shows.</p><p>Rival media giants including Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp. adopted strategies similar to \"Project Popcorn,\" Mr. Kilar noted.</p><p>Internally, Mr. Kilar led streamlining the Turner, HBO and Warner operating units, which had been run as stand-alone fiefs. That strategy also was soon embraced by others, including Disney.</p><p>The move and other consolidation efforts came with a human cost: Approximately 2,000 positions, including some of the most senior leaders of WarnerMedia, were eliminated.</p><p>Mr. Kilar also took a keen interest in gaming and had the unit report directly to him, whereas in the past it was layered within Warner Bros. In 2021, the unit posted record profits, and its game \"Harry Potter: Magic Awakened\" has surpassed last year's biggest movie hit \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" in terms of revenue, Mr. Kilar said.</p><p>Mr. Kilar said he was kept in the dark about AT&amp;T's talks with Discovery. Rather than immediately resign after the deal was announced, Mr. Kilar opted to stick it out. He traveled the globe to push HBO Max, staying involved in the day-to-day operations of the company.</p><p>His last few months weren't without drama. Mr. Kilar made the decisionto push out CNN's Mr. Zucker for failing to disclose a personal relationship with CNN marketing and communications chief Allison Gollust, who also subsequently resigned.</p><p>The revelation of the relationship was part of an investigation into whether former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo had misled his superiors about the extent of help he was providing his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in his fight against allegations of sexual harassment. Mr. Kilar took heat for the decision from CNN staffers at town-hall-style meetings.</p><p>\"There are times in this role where decisions need to be made that may not be popular but are important to make. Being a leader is not a popularity contest,\" Mr. Kilar said.</p><p>Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com</p><p>WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar Resigns</p>",
