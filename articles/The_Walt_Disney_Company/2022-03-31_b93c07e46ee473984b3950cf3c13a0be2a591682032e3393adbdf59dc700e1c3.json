  "title": "Lawsuit Challenges Florida Law Restricting Teaching About Sexual Orientation; Opponents call the measure the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, and suit argues it is unconstitutional",
  "text": "<p>\"This law harkens back, sadly, to some of the worst laws that have been passed in our country,\" including those that led to segregation, said Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for the plaintiffs. \"It's inconsistent with and hostile to our constitutional principles.\"</p><p>Ms. Kaplan argued a case before the Supreme Court that resulted in a 2013 decision invalidating a section of the Defense of Marriage Act, which allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. Two years later, the court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.</p><p>The Florida law, which Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Monday, has drawn national attention and triggered acrimonious debate. Supporters say it is aimed at asserting more parental control over children's education. Opponents say it is designed to censor discussion about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p><p>The law, which is scheduled to take effect on July 1, prohibits instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade and bans it in later grades if not \"age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\" It allows parents to sue school districts over alleged violations of the measure.</p><p>Walt Disney Co., a large employer in Florida, became ensnared in the fight over the law, coming under fire first for failing to take a public stance on the measure and then for opposing it only after it had passed. The company said on Monday that it would support efforts to get the law repealed or struck down.</p><p>The complaint argues that the law seeks to discourage discussion of LGBT identities in schools, while permitting discussion of heterosexuality. It says the measure's wording is so vague that it prevents people from understanding what exactly is forbidden. And, because the law provides parents the ability to sue, the result is a chilling effect on speech, the filing says.</p><p>The law creates \"a scheme in which parents can use the threat of litigation over vague statutory terms to menace school boards and intimidate teachers into offering a skewed, discriminatory curriculum,\" the complaint says.</p><p>Although the law has yet to take effect, the plaintiffs argue that it already has caused harm. They say some teachers and school administrators in Florida have said they would remove LGBT references from curricula and restrict discussions that touch on LGBT issues. One of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old sophomore, faces uncertainty over whether he can continue writing essays about issues related to his sexual identity, the complaint says. Another plaintiff, a teacher, worries about how she can teach without fear of losing her job, according to the complaint.</p><p>Taryn Fenske, a spokeswoman for Mr. DeSantis, said the newly signed law doesn't chill speech or prohibit student-prompted discussion in classrooms. She said the lawsuit \"is a political Hail Mary to undermine parental rights in Florida\" and criticized Disney for its \"recent activism\" in opposing the law.</p><p>\"This calculated, politically motivated, virtue-signaling lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend the legality of parents to protect their young children from sexual content in Florida public schools,\" Ms. Fenske said.</p><p>Disney didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Lawsuit Challenges Florida Law Restricting Teaching About Sexual Orientation</p>",
