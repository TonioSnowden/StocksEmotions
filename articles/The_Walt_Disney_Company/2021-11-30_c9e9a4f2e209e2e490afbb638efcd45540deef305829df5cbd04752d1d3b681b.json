  "title": "To Play Local Monopoly  Might Require Real Dollars  ---  New versions are popular, but some  businesses don't land spots on the board  ----  By Jennifer Levitz and Jon Kamp",
  "text": "<p>   WORCESTER, Mass. -- For months, New England's second-largest city has been buzzing about a Worcester version of Monopoly coming this fall. </p><p>   But the unveiling of the finished board showed that the growing genre of hyperlocal Monopoly is hardly all fun and games. </p><p>   At this month's Worcester Monopoly launch ceremony, representatives from Top Trumps USA, Inc., the creator of the Worcester-themed game, licensed by toy maker Hasbro Inc., mingled with city luminaries in the grand Beaux Arts-style train station. Monopoly swag festooned the space and a top-hat clad \"Mr. Monopoly\" mascot roamed by. (Yes, there was Free Parking.) </p><p>   Hours later, a less polished version of Mr. Monopoly sported a fake black eye at nearby Ralph's Tavern, a beloved Worcester watering hole that didn't land on the game, despite lobbying. Out back, patrons cheered as Ralph's owner Scot Bove fed whole Monopoly games into a noisy woodchipper. </p><p>   \"That was awesome!\" said Donna Vayo, a local mural artist who viewed the shredding. \"The boards looked great crumbling at the back with all the money flying in the air.\" </p><p>   Board games are notorious for provoking spats among players. Modeling the toys after actual real-life Main Streets is ratcheting up the competition.  In Worcester, game pieces are flying over the selection process for Worcester Monopoly and whether it's Worcester enough. Also absent are several area colleges, the city's well-known seltzer maker and its iconic lunch-car diners. A hot-yoga studio did make the cut. </p><p>   A key beef? Emerging revelations that for some local establishments, landing a coveted square on the game known for its colorful Monopoly dollars required thousands of real ones. </p><p>   Top Trumps USA said several factors determine inclusion, including local input. Top Trumps does require some businesses on the board to financially \"sponsor the project,\" Vice President of Sales Scott Whitney said in an interview. He declined to comment on terms. Participating establishments must sign confidentiality agreements, meaning they can't disclose the terms. </p><p>   An email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that Top Trumps sent a shop in Palm Springs, Calif., which is getting Palm Springs Monopoly in the spring, laid out the three-year terms for its \"approved packages\": The \"Bronze\" costs $21,000Ë›for a square on the board. The \"Silver\" is $36,000 and adds a Community Chest Card plugging the business. </p><p>   And $60,000 over three years gets a business the \"Gold\" package: a square, a Community Chest card, plus \"an image on the centre board montage\" and \"on the box lid montage.\" Packages also include varying numbers of free Monopoly games, which retail for around $40. </p><p>   Top Trumps didn't respond to a request for comment on pricing. </p><p>   Jeffrey Bernstein, the owner of Destination PSP gift shop who received the email, is a Monopoly aficionado who has collected at least 150 boards -- his favorite is a Hungarian version. But the entry cost was too Park Place for him, and he said he was turned off by the raw capitalism, even for an amusement based on capitalism. </p><p>   Atlantic City, N.J., is a model for original Monopoly, patented in 1935, but lost its monopoly on locale long ago. Now, hundreds of adaptations range from city themes to boards with Disney princesses and the Beatles. </p><p>   Localizing Monopoly can get dicey. Some shop owners, for instance, prefer not to be listed on Community Chest or Chance cards with unpleasant outcomes, such as ponying up money, said Nona Watson, chief executive at the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce. She helped create a \"Palm Springs Opoly\" game years ago through a different company, to raise money for the chamber's building, and said board spots sold for far less. </p><p>   Top Trumps USA is part of Winning Moves UK Ltd., a main Hasbro partner in producing themed and localized games, Hasbro said. Hasbro said that given limited squares on Monopoly boards, \"we do expect there may be disappointment\" in communities. Hasbro declined to comment on the pricing for places on the Top Trumps board. </p><p>   In a June Worcester publicity blitz, Top Trumps said the game would be \"an accurate depiction of what locals love about the area\" and solicited emailed feedback. More than 60,000 ideas flowed in, the company said. </p><p>   Business owners drummed up votes, including at the circa 1934 Ralph's Tavern, where owner Mr. Bove is a Monopoly fan. \"I always had to have the little dog, the Scottie dog,\" he said of his favorite Monopoly token. He even let customers pay with Monopoly money one night to rally support. But Ralph's didn't get a square. Mr. Bove said he wasn't asked to pay for one. </p><p>   Top Trumps's Mr. Whitney said Ralph's was \"hugely popular\" but that a tavern didn't fit a family game.  Mr. Whitney said Top Trumps would donate money to a Ralph's patron, a Monopoly fan who is ill and for whom the bar is raising money. </p><p>   Worcester Monopoly does include mainstay establishments, monuments and nonprofit groups that didn't pay. But the launch has spawned a side parlor game: Analyzing the hodgepodge mix on the board. A credit union scored two squares, one around the corner from a square featuring a yoga studio. Both companies declined to discuss any payments. No local diners, famous parts of the cityscape, got on. \"It's crazy,\" said Kim Kniskern, who owns the Miss Worcester Diner, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \"I was waiting to see what diner was there.\" </p><p>   Amy Lynn Chase, the owner of Crompton Collective boutique, said Top Trumps called several times and offered her a spot for $20,000 \"to as low as 7,000.\" She declined, but plans to sell boards and donate profits to an animal-rescue league that is on the game. \"We originally thought this board was going to be great for Worcester,\" Ms. Chase said, \"and then the conversation turned a little negative.\" </p><p></p>",
