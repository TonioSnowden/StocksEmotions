  "title": "Sports:  The Angels Are for Sale  After Spending Spree Fails  ----  By Tim Brown",
  "text": "<p>    If this is the end of Arte Moreno's baseball stewardship in Anaheim -- when there is no more time for promises or room for hopeful press conferences -- there will only be the results. And for a man who bought a team from Walt Disney Co., it isn't a storybook ending. The Angels -- the team he insisted on calling \"Los Angeles\" despite being an hour or so south of L.A. -- are, by now, terrible. </p><p>   Nearly 20 years earlier, Moreno had purchased a World Series champion. On Tuesday, Moreno, at 76 years old, announced he would explore a sale of the franchise he bought from Disney for $183.5 million and could sell for 10 or 12 times more. </p><p>   In between, he poured more than $1 billion into free agents in barely more than the past decade alone, offered perhaps as much to free agents who signed elsewhere, signed the league's best player -- Mike Trout -- to the game's richest contract and committed to top-10 payrolls year after year after year. </p><p>   The Angels didn't return to the World Series under Moreno. Other teams sold their fans on long-term rebuilds that traded on their fans' blind -- and economic -- devotion. Moreno persisted. The league around him emptied its payrolls, chased draft picks and wrote off seasons. Moreno didn't. He kept spending, and the Angels kept losing. </p><p>   And by the end, he is enduring what will almost certainly be a seventh consecutive losing season, an eighth consecutive season without a postseason appearance and a 13th consecutive season without winning a playoff game. </p><p>   The Angels, with Moreno as their owner, did less with more than any team in baseball, again and again, until a Tuesday in the summer of Trout's 31st birthday, when Moreno decided to cash out. </p><p>   \"Although this difficult decision was entirely our choice and deserved a great deal of thoughtful consideration, my family and I have ultimately come to the conclusion that now is the time,\" Moreno said in a statement. </p><p>   He offers a fixer upper for something like $2 billion, and probably more. A fan base that showed up 3 million strong from 2003, his first year as an owner, through 2019, the season before the pandemic. A roster with Trout, Anthony Rendon, little in the way of pitching, and, for now, Shohei Ohtani. A bottom-five farm system. The Angels also have a ballpark that is lovely in spots, merely playable in others and fraying on the edges -- the remnants of a deal with the city that would have allowed him to build around the park, but failed. </p><p>   That Moreno and the Angels squandered much of Trout's prime grew particularly galling over the past five seasons, when Trout was joined by Ohtani, the spectacular two-way talent who was American League MVP in 2021. Ohtani is again among the best players in the league and is again toiling for a team rendered irrelevant by its many shortcomings. Due to become a free agent after the 2023 season, Ohtani, 28, is likely to be traded before then, a decision -- and public relations storm -- Moreno could leave to the next owner. </p><p>   Moreno in recent seasons seemed to much prefer the shadows. As the team recently tore through four managers in five seasons and four general managers in 12, he appeared to grow sensitive when the blame had nowhere to go but to him. He hasn't addressed the media outside of introductory news conferences in about two years. The memories of five playoff teams in his first seven years as owner, capable teams led by Mike Scioscia and powered by Vladimir Guerrero, Jered Weaver, John Lackey and Mike Napoli, lost their meaning when down seasons became the norm. </p><p></p>",
