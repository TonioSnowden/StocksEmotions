  "title": "Disney Shares Rally as Former CEO Robert Iger Returns; Investors cheer leadership change as entertainment company contends with streaming challenges",
  "text": "<p>Disney's board of directors on Sunday night ousted CEO Bob Chapek and named Mr. Iger, the company's former chairman and CEO, as his successor. The surprise switch to Mr. Iger, who left the company at the end of last year, came as Burbank, Calif.-based Disney faces numerous challenges, including weaker-than-expected financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter centered on its streaming shortfalls.</p><p>Disney shares opened 9% higher at $100.12 before retreating somewhat. In midday trading on Monday, the shares were up 5.8% at $97.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 Index were down 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.</p><p>Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson upgraded Disney shares after the executive change, recommending the stock for the first time since May 2020. Mr. Nathanson had been down on the shares for a number of reasons, including Mr. Chapek's commitment to what the analyst considered an unrealistic streaming strategy.</p><p>Mr. Nathanson said the returning Disney boss built the company into the global powerhouse it is today and should hopefully repeat that success as the entertainment company navigatesa tumultuous media landscape. He added that Disney and investors are likely to appreciate Mr. Iger's demeanor, which Mr. Nathanson said provides \"a constant ballast in the roughest of media waters.\"</p><p>\"We believe investors will value the transparency and return Disney some of its long-lost magic with a stronger narrative driving the stock higher again,\" Mr. Nathanson said. He now rates Disney shares as \"outperform,\" up from a \"market perform\" rating.</p><p>Needham &amp; Co. analyst Laura Martin said Mr. Iger's return brings back a \"calming, patient, diplomatic\" style of handling internal conflicts along with a deft hand for dealing with public-relations dust-ups, such as the controversy around the \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation passed in Florida earlier this year.</p><p>Before he stepped down as Disney's chief executive in February 2020 and shifted his role to executive chairman, Mr. Iger's 15-year tenure marked record profitability for the company. Disney's share price rose more than fivefold and its annual net income more than quadrupled during that time.</p><p>The company's shares have faced more challenges since Mr. Chapek took over as chief executive, falling sharply at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic before recovering alongside the broader market through early 2021, only to incur a string of declines since. Even with Monday's early gains, the company's shares are down 37% this year.</p><p>Mr. Chapek previously said he expected the streaming business to be profitable by September 2024, although its loss totaled nearly $1.5 billion for the most recent quarter. Disney's results have been buoyed by record performance and price increases for its theme parks and other divisions.</p><p>Ms. Martin said investors will expect Mr. Iger to right the streaming ship and moderate the division's losses more quickly than Mr. Chapek could.</p><p>Mr. Iger rejoins as CEO on a two-year contract, during which he is expected to develop a strategy to reignite growth at the company and develop a successor.</p><p>Wells Fargo analysts said they were less surprised with the ousting of Mr. Chapek than with the return of Mr. Iger. Still, they said they were pleased with the move, because reinstalling the former CEO \"puts perhaps the best leader in media at the helm with a mandate to shake things up.\"</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Shares Rally as Former CEO Robert Iger Returns</p>",
