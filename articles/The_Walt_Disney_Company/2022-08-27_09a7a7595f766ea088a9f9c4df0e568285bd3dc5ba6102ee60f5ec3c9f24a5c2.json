  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Disney's Pricing Magic: A Guide to Spending Your Money at Walt Disney World",
  "text": "<p>Here's a guide to navigating Walt Disney World on a budget -- and a primer for those looking to go all out. (Many of these tips translate to a Disneyland vacation as well, though the two resorts do vary in terms of offerings and pricing.)</p><p>Finding bargains</p><p>-- Hotel: When planning a Disney vacation on a shoestring budget, one easy way to save money can be to stay off-site -- meaning at a non-Disney-owned hotel. Look for deals on sites like Expedia or Priceline for Disney's \"Good Neighbor\" hotels, which are located close to Disney's theme parks. These hotels are AAA-approved and vetted to meet Disney standards. Some advertise rates that are competitive with Disney's \"value\" resorts, which start at around $100 per night.</p><p>Guests staying at certain non-Disney-owned hotels are eligible for one major perk offered to families staying at Disney-owned resorts: early theme-park entry. Wherever you end up staying, be sure to factor in the cost of transportation. Not all off-site hotels offer complimentary shuttles to the parks, whereas Walt Disney World offers free transportation between its hotels and parks via boats, buses, monorails and gondolas.</p><p>-- Tickets: The starting price for a one-day theme park ticket hasn't increased since 2018, a Walt Disney World spokeswoman said. The prices of tickets vary based on demand. If cost is an issue, consider going to the parks for fewer days. Single-park tickets are cheaper than the Park Hopper tickets that allow people to visit multiple theme parks in one day. Purchase tickets through an authorized third-party seller, such as Undercover Tourist or Get Away Today, to get a discount.</p><p>Don't buy tickets from street vendors or eBay, since these can be scams. Authorized third-party ticket sellers will display a Disney-permitted emblem. And remember: Tickets don't guarantee admission. Confirm that reservations in Disney's Park Pass system are available before purchasing your tickets and then link them to your profile in the My Disney Experience app to make your reservations immediately.</p><p>-- Food: Have breakfast in your room before heading to the parks, and pack food for lunches or snacks throughout the day. At counter-service restaurants, opt for free ice water instead of soda, and skip the sides on entrees. Pro tip: Buy Disney-themed treats like fruit gummies from a grocery store via Instacart and have them delivered to your hotel.</p><p>-- Extras: Buy Disney toys, autograph books or the coveted mouse ears online in advance to surprise the kids during the trip. Disney photographers stationed throughout the parks can also take photos of you and your family with your smartphone, subject to Covid safety policies, at no cost.</p><p>For Disney fun on non-park days, visit the Disney Springs shopping complex or check out the resorts located around Walt Disney World. Free activities throughout the resorts include campfire singalongs with Disney's chipmunk characters Chip and Dale and outdoor movie screenings at night.</p><p>Going deluxe</p><p>-- Hotel: If cost isn't a concern, stay at a deluxe Disney resort, such as the Contemporary or Polynesian Resorts near the Magic Kingdom. Nightly rates for these hotels start at $390, but can go as high as more than $4,000 for a two-bedroom suite with club level access during popular times. Staying at a deluxe resort doesn't have to come with a deluxe price tag. One way to score a deal is by renting a unit through the Disney Vacation Club timeshare program. Sites like DVC Rental Store and David's Vacation Club Rentals rent out DVC members' unused points to book units.</p><p>If you would prefer a break from Disney when you head back to your hotel, another option is staying at the Four Seasons Resort. The AAA Five Diamond Resort is located within Golden Oak, a luxury home community on Walt Disney World property.</p><p>-- Tickets: Splurge on the Park Hopper Plus add-on, which is priced between $85 and $105 depending on the number of days. These tickets enable travelers to visit multiple theme parks each day, in addition to granting them admission to visit Walt Disney World's two water parks, the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex and Walt Disney World's golf and miniature golf courses.</p><p>-- Food: Forget about the burgers and fries. There are many fine-dining establishments, including Victoria &amp; Albert's. The prix-fixe menu starts at $295 per guest. (Restaurants can book up in advance.)</p><p>-- Extras: Book a private VIP tour for the most seamless theme-park experience. Disney's VIP tours cost between $425 and $850 an hour, depending on the season, for a group of up to 10 people, with a minimum length of seven continuous hours. The tour will offer visitors front-of-line access to attractions and transportation between theme parks if you visit more than one.</p><p>Want the highest-quality photos of your trip? Book a private session with a Disney photographer through the Capture Your Moment service, which costs $79 for a 20-minute session with up to eight people.</p><p>To avoid the crowds during the fireworks shows, reserve a private fireworks cruise, which starts at $399 plus tax, not including gratuities. The cruises take place on a 25-foot boat, fitting up to 10 guests. Banners, balloons and assorted snacks and soft drinks are included.</p>",
