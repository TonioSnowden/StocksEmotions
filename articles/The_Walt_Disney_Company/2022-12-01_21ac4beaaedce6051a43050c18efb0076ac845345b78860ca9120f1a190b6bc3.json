  "text": "<p>He said the company would notify \"a limited number of individuals, largely some of our paid contributors, as part of a recalibrated reporting strategy.\" He added that he would notify affected employees on Thursday and follow up with more details.</p><p>A CNN spokeswoman didn't comment beyond the memo.</p><p>The cable-news network's cutbacks follow some at other entertainment companies. AMC Networks Inc. this week said it would lay off about 200 U.S.-based employees after struggling to make enough money from streaming services to offset losses from a continued decline in cable television.</p><p>Walt Disney Co. said in November that it would initiate layoffs after posting a disappointing earnings report. Its flagship Disney+ service has incurred losses of more than $8 billion over the past three years. About a week later, in a surprise, it brought backRobert Iger as chief executive.</p><p>Paramount Global also suggested that it would soon make substantial cost cuts during an earnings call in November after it reported a decline in third-quarter profit because of higher costs.</p><p>The CNN layoffs are the latest signs of a shaky start to the April merger of Discovery Inc. with AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia. Over the summer, Warner Bros. Discovery, which also owns HBO, TNT and the Food Network, cut its outlook for this year and next in part because of a slowdown in advertising.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery has laid off about 1,000 employees since April as it cuts costs and grapples with high debt. Those cuts included staffers at HBO, the Warner Bros. movie and television production units and previous reductions at CNN.</p><p>In the spring, CNN pulled the plug on its streaming service CNN+ about a month after it launched amid an underwhelming reception. It had invested $300 million in the streaming service but didn't get many subscribers. Mr. Licht announced the service was shutting down less than two weeks after CNN ownership shifted from AT&amp;T to Warner Bros. Discovery.</p><p>Mr. Licht has also begun overhauling CNN's lineup. In August, the network canceled its Sunday morning show \"Reliable Sources\" as part of a broader shake-up of the news channel's Sunday morning lineup. Brian Stelter, the host of \"Reliable Sources\" and the network's chief media correspondent, left CNN after the show was canceled.</p><p>Mr. Licht has indicated he wants CNN to change the perception that its political coverage is too partisan. That includes having more news shows and fewer opinion shows. David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, has also said he wants to differentiate CNN from \"advocacy networks.\"</p><p>CNN created a morning news show with Don Lemon, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins as part of its lineup overhaul. Mr. Lemon left his prime-time program \"Don Lemon Tonight\" to join the new morning show.</p><p>In his memo to staff, Mr. Licht said laid off employees who are bonus eligible will still receive their 2022 bonuses.</p>",
