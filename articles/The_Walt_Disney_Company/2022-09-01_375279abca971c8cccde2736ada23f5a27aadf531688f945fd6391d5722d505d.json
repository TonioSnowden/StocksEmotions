  "title": "Mike, Disney Plus review — Trevante Rhodes shines in fast-paced show about the life of Mike Tyson",
  "text": "<p>It is 1974 and eight-year-old Mike Tyson has just endured his umpteenth beating from the kids on his block. His sister, Denise, stares at his bloody nose in disgust. “You fight or you die, so what you gonna do about it?” she barks.</p> <p>This is the kind of writing we're dealing with in <em>Mike</em>, an eight-part biopic of the heavyweight boxer and convicted sex offender nicknamed Iron Mike. Like the man himself, <em>Mike</em> can be boorish and histrionic; it certainly doesn't know the meaning of subtlety.</p> <p>One of the biggest clunkers comes as Tyson's mother-in-law imparts some advice over dinner: “Donald Trump has offered his consulting services. Now that's a businessman you can trust.”</p> <p>But if you can forgive the script's lapses into silliness, you are left with a fast-paced and mostly watchable series in which Trevante Rhodes (<em>Moonlight</em>) shines in the title role, capturing Tyson's imposing physicality and his soft, lisping voice. We follow his early years in Brownsville, New York, during which he witnesses violent exchanges between his parents and is proclaimed “retarded” by a doctor. His early adolescence is spent fighting and robbing houses. His petty criminality eventually lands him in a juvenile detention centre where he meets a trainer who will set him on the path to sporting greatness.</p> <p>That this is a collaboration between screenwriter Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie, the duo behind the Tonya Harding biopic <em>I, Tonya</em>, is evident in the stylistic tics that include copious freeze-frames, fourth-wall-breaking asides and slow-motion fight scenes in which skin ripples and blood flies, overlaid with excitable commentary (“Even Tyson's punches sound different”). There are surface similarities, too, in the contradictory natures of their chosen protagonists: like Harding, Tyson wants to feel valued and loved, though his method of achieving it is to style himself as a monster in the ring.</p> <p>We know, of course, that Tyson could be monstrous out of the ring too, never more so than in his treatment of women. His 1992 rape conviction, which saw him imprisoned for less than three years, brings a dramatic shift in the fifth episode, with events told through the eyes of his victim, the 18-year-old beauty pageant contestant Desiree Washington. The change in perspective is necessary, though it also serves to expose the overly playful tone elsewhere. For all its attempts at introspection, <em>Mike</em> is too enamoured with its subject to get to grips fully with his flaws.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Disney Plus from September 8 in the UK; available now on Hulu in the US</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2022 'Mike, Disney Plus review — Trevante Rhodes shines in fast-paced show about the life of Mike Tyson' FT.com 1 September.
