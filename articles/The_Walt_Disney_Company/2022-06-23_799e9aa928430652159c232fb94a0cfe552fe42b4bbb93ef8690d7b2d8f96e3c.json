  "text": "<p>   Even paper bags for takeout orders -- which many rich countries typically import -- are local. At an automated bag factory that a local company, Print Lab Pte., began operating in Singapore last month, cartons of paper go into a school-bus-sized machine that cuts, folds, and handles it, producing completed bags. </p><p>   A push for high-tech production helped persuade Silicon Valley-based HP Inc. to open a new manufacturing facility in 2017 in Singapore for print heads, which dispense ink from cartridges to paper. Four years earlier, it had relocated the labor-intensive process of manufacturing lower-complexity print heads from Singapore to cheaper Malaysia. But it stuck with Singapore to make industrial print heads used in commercial printers for products such as books and posters. At the facility's grand opening, robots poured guests glasses of wine. </p><p>   Technological advances mean robotic arms that once could move in only one or two directions can now make nearly the same rotations as the human hand, equipping them for a much wider range of tasks. That dexterity is on display on HP's production lines: A robot arm clutches a tab of adhesive liner and another peels from it, placing the sticky side on a cartridge to prevent ink from leaking. </p><p>   \"Imagine doing that job eight hours a day,\" said Steve Connor, HP's global head of inkjet supply operations. HP said the two robotic manufacturing lines in Singapore decreased manufacturing costs by 20%, compared with previous production methods. </p><p>   The robots work 24 hours a day and are precise, leading to higher yield and fewer errors, said Mr. Connor. Small automated vehicles bearing trays collect batches of completed cartridges and deposit them while blaring Star Wars theme music, to make sure humans don't trip over them -- not that the music seems necessary. \"I walk in here and go 'Where are all the people?' \" said Mr. Connor. </p><p>   The company has retrained staff to work with the machines, tapping into government grants that subsidize training by lecturers from the city's technical-training institutes. Operators who once loaded materials are taught to troubleshoot and fix basic mechanical problems. Some staff that once used microscopes to inspect cartridges for defects now train robots to do that. The humans verify that cartridges rejected by the robots actually have problems, helping to hone robotic judgment. </p><p>   At another Singapore factory, 3-D printers print out some of their own parts, said Ng Tian Chong, HP's managing director for greater Asia: \"Our 3-D printer actually gives birth to itself.\" </p><p></p>",
