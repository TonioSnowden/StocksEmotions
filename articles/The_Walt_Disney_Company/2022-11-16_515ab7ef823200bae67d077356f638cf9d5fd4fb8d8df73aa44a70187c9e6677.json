  "text": "<p>   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Some Republican governors and their donors said former President Donald Trump's role as a leader of their party is diminished as they convened for an annual event the week after the GOP's subpar midterm election performance. </p><p>   The Republican Governors Association meeting, which began on Monday at a resort near Disney World, is the first major gathering of GOP officeholders following elections that left the party in the Senate minority and with likely a slim House majority once all the votes are counted. </p><p>   The GOP has seen its share of governorships decline, including in this year's election, during Mr. Trump's time as a top Republican Party figure. On Monday night, Democrat Katie Hobbs was declared the winner of the closely watched Arizona governor race, defeating Kari Lake, a prominent Trump ally. </p><p>   Around the lobby bar and hallway corridors of the hotel hosting the gathering, there have been frequent discussions about how much his midterm involvement hurt the party's electoral performance. </p><p>   \"I have tremendous respect for President Trump and the effectiveness of some of his policies and initiatives, but I think it's time for a change for our party and country,\" said Ricky Caplin, a top RGA donor and technology entrepreneur from Jacksonville, Fla. </p><p>   Mr. Caplin, who said he has supported Mr. Trump in the past, is intrigued by potential 2024 GOP presidential campaigns that could be put forward by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </p><p>   Less than 200 miles to the south of the RGA's meeting, Mr. Trump announced a 2024 presidential bid Tuesday evening at his resort in Palm Beach. Earlier, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who easily won re-election last week, called that bad politics. </p><p>   \"Announcing you are running for president the week after a general election is just a terrible idea,\" he said on the meeting's sidelines. \"It's just not smart and can only be self-serving.\" </p><p>   Mr. Sununu, who is sometimes mentioned as a possible 2024 presidential candidate, said Mr. Trump shouldn't be considered the GOP's figurehead. \"He will never not be in the conversation, but his impact on the global voice of the Republican Party, I think, it's more minimal by the day,\" he said. \"It's not negligible, but it's decreasing.\" </p><p>   Mr. Sununu added: \"I think the argument could definitely be made that Ron DeSantis is the front-runner to be president right now.\" </p><p>   A spokesman for Mr. Trump didn't respond to an email seeking comment. The former president has suggested that Messrs. DeSantis and Youngkin owed their gubernatorial victories to him, and that his endorsed candidates overall had performed better than conveyed by the media. </p><p>   Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, an ally of Mr. Trump, on Monday let members know she was interested in running for re-election to her post. </p><p>   Mr. Sununu said he would be open to someone else serving in the top RNC role. \"If you stick with the exact same team, you are likely to get the exact same results,\" he said. \"I don't think anybody thinks the results this past election were outstanding by any means.\" </p><p>   South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem expressed skepticism about Ms. McDaniel remaining in her post. \"Who loses this much and gets to keep their job?\" she said in an interview. </p><p>   Emma Vaughn, a spokeswoman for Ms. McDaniel's re-election bid, defended the chairwoman's tenure. \"Under Chairwoman McDaniel's leadership the Republican National Committee delivered historic wins,\" she said. \"Republicans took back the House, elected more diverse candidates than ever before, and defended every single incumbent Republican senator and governor.\" </p><p>   Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a past RGA chairman, said candidates who ran in the model of Mr. Trump were almost always unsuccessful this year. \"The candidates who lost were Trump candidates,\" he said. </p><p>   Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican who won re-election last week, was less direct in his criticism of Mr. Trump, when asked about his responsibility for the GOP's poor showing. </p><p>   \"It matters who candidates are,\" he said. \"It just matters who goes into that general election. You cannot win with a narrow base.\" </p><p></p>",
