  "title": "Lego: old bricks are better than gold bricks",
  "text": "<p>Lego proliferates in many family homes. It clogs vacuum cleaners. It accumulates in drifts in dusty corners. It causes excruciating pain to unwary adults who step on it barefoot. </p> <p>Take heart, weary parent, as you shell out £130 for a Hogwarts Chamber of Secrets set for your kid. Those little plastic bricks could also be a valuable asset. </p> <p>Lego toys are <a href=\"https://www.hse.ru/en/news/research/536477053.html\">a better investment </a>than gold, according to researchers from Moscow's Higher School of Economics. The yellow metal and the stock market suffer from price volatility. “Retired” Lego sets may be more stable and can appreciate faster. Their value rose by an annual average of 11 per cent over 28 years, apparently. </p> <p>There is a massive caveat. You cannot sell a bucket of loose bricks for a fat cheque. Equally, while that Temple of Doom set may be complete, those chew marks on Indiana Jones's hat imply depreciation. The study analysed the prices of 2,322 <em>unopened</em> Lego sets.</p> <p>The most expensive sets on the second-hand market are mint, boxed editions of the original Millennium Falcon from Star Wars for about $1,500, or a vintage Taj Mahal for up to $2,000. The latter, ounce-for-ounce, is indeed worth more than gold.</p> <p>Adult collectors buy these sets. For a festive season purchase to have a chance of appreciating in value, you would have to persuade the recipient to “lay it down” unopened, rather like a bottle of fine wine.</p> <p>The same frenzy that has pushed up real estate and stock prices has also spilled over to collectibles such as sneakers, trading cards, vintage video games and handbags. It is also driving demand for digital artwork in the form of non-fungible tokens.</p> <p>But unlike NFTs, no one is paying millions for a Lego set. In contrast, a vintage <em>Super Mario Bros</em> video game sold for $2m and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4\">Nyan Cat NFT</a> fetched nearly $600,000. </p> <p>Lego collectors are also exposed to price drops when the company reissues popular sets.</p> <p>The real wonder of Lego is not that fancy playsets have resale values running into thousands of dollars. It is that parents happily shell out $100 for plastic construction toys available — albeit in basic forms — as cheap Chinese knock-offs.</p> <p>The investment value of Lego reflects the greater triumph of a family-owned manufacturer from Denmark. Through shrewd licensing, smart marketing and strict quality control, Lego Group sets benchmark prices for small, foot-unfriendly bricks all over the world.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
