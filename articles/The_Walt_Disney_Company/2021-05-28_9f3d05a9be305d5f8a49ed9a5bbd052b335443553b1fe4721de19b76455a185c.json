  "text": "<p>Since bringing together the players for his newly formed Sinfonia of London in 2018, conductor John Wilson has certainly been giving them a good workout. After a disc of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c65bcaa4-6ca5-42ef-a917-e4cdc9964999\">music for strings</a>, here is a chance to put the wind section in the spotlight.</p> <p>This disc of early works by the fastidious French composer Henri Dutilleux succeeds beyond expectation. At its best, it is magical in an entirely Gallic way, as befits a nation that has given us so much music of enchantment by composers such as Ravel and Dukas (think of the Mickey Mouse episode in Disney's <em>Fantasia</em>).</p> <p>Each of those comes to mind in the ballet score to <em>Le Loup</em>. Written in 1953 to a scenario by Jean Anouilh and Georges Neveux, it reverses the fairytale of beauty and the beast, so that a gypsy girl finds she has actually fallen in love with a wolf. As well as strong echoes of Ravel and Dukas, Dutilleux's music has the quickness of imagination and discriminating use of the orchestra that were becoming his trademarks.</p> <p>The other works are competition pieces for wind soloists and piano, written for end-of-year exams at the Paris Conservatoire in the 1940s. If that sounds dull, think again, as arranger Kenneth Hesketh has clothed them in the most captivating orchestrations. </p> <p>Best is the <em>Sonatine</em> for flute, a minor miracle of sonic beauty. The Sinfonia of London's flautist, Adam Walker, is more than up to the task, but then so are all the performances, bewitchingly played and imaginatively directed by Wilson.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>‘</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0932BG2XD?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B0932BG2XD\"><em>Dutilleux: Le Loup</em></a><em>' is released by Chandos</em></p><p>Source: Richard Fairman 2021 'Sinfonia of London's Dutilleux: Le Loup — bewitchingly played ' FT.com 28 May.
