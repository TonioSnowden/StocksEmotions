  "text": "<p>Ms. Heard countersued Mr. Depp and has said the op-ed was accurate and her ex-husband emotionally and physically abused her throughout their relationship and marriage. The former couple was married for 15 months.</p><p>A seven-person jury in Fairfax County Circuit Court is considering the cases in a weekslong trial. Here's what to know about the cases.</p><p>Why is Johnny Depp suing Amber Heard?</p><p>Mr. Depp is accusing Ms. Heard of defamation for alleging he was a domestic abuser. In a complaint filed in Fairfax County Circuit Court in 2019, Mr. Depp's attorneys call the allegations \"demonstrably false\" and \"defamatory.\"</p><p>Mr. Depp argued the accusations of abuse weren't true and they damaged his career and reputation. Days after Ms. Heard's op-ed was published in December 2018, the complaint said, Disney removed Mr. Depp from his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film franchise. A representative for Walt Disney Co. didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The lawsuit also alleges that Ms. Heard abused Mr. Depp. The complaint details one incident in which Ms. Heard allegedly threw a glass vodka bottle at Mr. Depp, leaving his middle finger injured and requiring surgical reattachment.</p><p>Ms. Heard said her op-ed was accurate and true, and has accused Mr. Depp of defamation for claiming she fabricated injuries related to alleged abuse. She denied his allegations that she abused him.</p><p>Mr. Depp's attorneys, in their complaint, said the actor hopes the lawsuit will \"clear his name,\" \"restore his reputation\" and \"establish Ms. Heard's legal liability for continuing her campaign to push a false narrative that he committed domestic violence against her.\"</p><p>Why is Amber Heard suing Johnny Depp?</p><p>Ms. Heard sought to dismiss Mr. Depp's lawsuit, alleging Mr. Depp regularly abused her throughout their relationship and often when he was drunk or high. The motion from Ms. Heard's attorneys describes several incidents of alleged abuse starting in late 2012 or early 2013.</p><p>In August 2020, Ms. Heard filed a $100 million counterclaim against Mr. Depp. Ms. Heard also accused Mr. Depp of defamation and orchestrating efforts to destroy her career. Mr. Depp's lawsuit, Ms. Heard's counterclaim reads, \"is the lynchpin in the scheme to destroy Ms. Heard's career.\"</p><p>Ms. Heard alleges Mr. Depp \"threatened to kill her and otherwise harm her in private messages to friends.\" She has pointed to 2013 text messages between Mr. Depp and actor Paul Bettany, in which Mr. Depp wrote, \"Let's burn Amber.\"</p><p>Ms. Heard is also accusing Mr. Depp of defamation over a November 2018 interview in GQ magazine. Ms. Heard alleges Mr. Depp falsely claimed she fabricated his abuse.</p><p>Mr. Depp said he has never abused Ms. Heard, and that allegations of abuse were \"part of an elaborate hoax\" to benefit her career. Mr. Depp also denied her claims that he made defamatory statements and intended to \"destroy her career.\"</p><p>What did Ms. Heard write in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed?</p><p>Without naming individuals involved, Ms. Heard described a history of domestic abuse, harassment and sexual assault in her December 2018 Washington Post piece.</p><p>The op-ed, which came in the wake of the #MeToo movement, detailed what she described as harassment she faced starting in 2016. That year, Ms. Heard publicly accused Mr. Depp of abuse and filed a domestic violence restraining order against him in California state court. At the time, photos of Ms. Heard entering a state court with visible bruises on her face made headlines.</p><p>\"I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,\" Ms. Heard wrote.</p><p>She said she was told she would be blacklisted as an actress, adding that a movie role she was slated to play was recast. She wrote that powerful men facing abuse accusations were protected by institutions.</p><p>Mr. Depp's attorneys said in their complaint that the actor never abused Ms. Heard. Her false implication, they said, \"prejudiced Mr. Depp in his career as a film actor and incalculably (and immediately) damaged his reputation as a public figure.\"</p><p>What happened in the U.K. trial?</p><p>In 2020, Mr. Depp lost a libel case against a British tabloid newspaper that called him a \"wife beater\" over his treatment of Ms. Heard.</p><p>In an article about Mr. Depp's role in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise, the Sun alleged the actor was a \"wife beater.\" That lawsuit targeted News Group Newspapers Ltd., which owns the Sun and is part of News Corp. The Wall Street Journal is also owned by News Corp.</p><p>The English judge found that, out of 14 incidents of alleged domestic violence he reviewed between the two actors, two didn't occur. The majority of those incidents, Judge Andrew Nicol said, \"have been proved to the civil standard.\"</p><p>The civil standard in English courts has a lower bar than the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement for criminal cases in the U.S.</p><p>Who are Johnny Depp's and Amber Heard's witnesses?</p><p>Both Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard provided the court with lists of possible witnesses that included other actors and celebrities. Mr. Depp's list includes Mr. Bettany, and Ms. Heard's includes actor James Franco and Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>The Trial of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: What to Know So Far</p>",
