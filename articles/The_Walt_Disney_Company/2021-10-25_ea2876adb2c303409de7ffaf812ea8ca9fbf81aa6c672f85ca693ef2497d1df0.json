  "title": "Encore (A Special Report) --- New Treatments for Those With 'Exercise Intolerance': With real-time tests, doctors can now better diagnose the condition",
  "text": "<p>Exercise can trigger asthma in people who don't ordinarily have it, and diseases and complications from infections increasingly are also seen as having a role in exercise intolerance. New research shows, for example, that some Covid patients who have recovered from acute infection after having only mild symptoms continue to have problems exerting themselves.</p><p>When looking for underlying causes of exercise intolerance, doctors can administer various real-time diagnostic tests while the patient is attempting to exercise on a stationary bike or treadmill. Such tests can involve invasive methods such as intravenous catheters to measure blood flow through the heart's chambers, or miniature cameras to observe possible airflow obstruction</p><p>\"With exercise problems it can be challenging to medically evaluate complaints, so it's important to get a comprehensive evaluation,\" says J. Tod Olin, director of the Exercise and Performance Breathing Center at Denver's National Jewish Health hospital.</p><p>Dr. Olin diagnoses and treats patients with a condition known as EILO -- for exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction -- in which the upper airway inappropriately narrows during intense exercise, frequently causing loud, gasping breathing and the appearance of respiratory distress. Previously known as vocal-cord dysfunction, it is often misdiagnosed as asthma, according to Dr. Olin, although patients can have both conditions.</p><p>While Dr. Olin sees this problem often in young elite athletes, it can also happen to middle-aged exercise buffs. Angela Minnefield, an avid runner, started having breathing problems while running at age 50. The Indianapolis pharmaceutical company quality engineer sought help from allergists, sports-medicine doctors and an ear-nose-and-throat specialist. She was diagnosed with vocal-cord dysfunction, and was advised to try yoga and to breathe differently. But the techniques she was shown did not help. She felt frustrated and unsure where to turn next.</p><p>With the help of Dr. Olin's program, she was able to see her own vocal cords on a screen to better understand what was happening, and she practiced a breathing technique Dr. Olin developed -- nicknamed the \"Darth Vader technique,\" because it can make the patient sound like the ominous character behind the helmet in \"Star Wars.\"</p><p>Ms. Minnefield, now 58, recently got her running time down to just over an 8-minute mile, the fastest she has run in years. \"It has been a journey, but I finally started to enjoy running again,\" she says.</p><p>In another type of test, Darlene Kim, a cardiologist at National Jewish Health, looks for the causes of exercise intolerance in her patients by placing a heart catheter through a vein in the patient's neck. The catheter passes through the right side of the heart and follows the path of blood flow into the pulmonary artery in the lungs, enabling clinicians to take measurements as the patient exercises on a stationary bicycle. The resulting data can reveal early signs of heart failure, dangerous elevations of blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, and other conditions.</p><p>With the right diagnosis she can prescribe the appropriate treatment, such as medication, salt and fluid adjustments in the diet, or cardiac monitors.</p><p>\"We always want people to be able to exercise, as long as it is safe,\" Dr. Kim says.</p><p>The increased use of so-called invasive cardiopulmonary exercise tests in recent years has increased doctor's abilities to intervene before conditions become life-threatening.</p><p>Aaron Waxman, director of the pulmonary vascular disease program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, says that exercise testing is especially important for early detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the type of high blood pressure that progressively affects the arteries in the lung and over time leads to a form of heart failure and early death.</p><p>\"If we can intervene at early stages of disease, therapies can be even more helpful,\" Dr. Waxman says.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Landro, a former Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor, is the author of \"Survivor: Taking Control of Your Fight Against Cancer.\" She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p>",
