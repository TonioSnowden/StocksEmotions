  "title": "'Let's Go Brandon' and Other Codes  ----  By Peter Funt",
  "text": "<p>   Staff at Disney World refer to a troublemaker as a \"treasured guest.\" A \"Code Winnie\" alert means someone urinated in the pool. </p><p>   Speaking in code is nothing new, although it got unexpected attention on Christmas Eve when a father of four from Oregon called a \"Santa Tracker\" phone line staffed by Joe Biden and got the president to assent to the seemingly innocuous statement \"Let's go, Brandon.\" </p><p>   The phrase grew out of an interview following an October Nascar race in Alabama, when the crowd shouted an obscenity followed by Mr. Biden's name. A reporter told the winning driver, Brandon Brown, that fans were chanting \"Let's go Brandon.\" It stuck, at least in some circles, and the phrase has appeared on protest signs, in Republican congressional speeches and on merchandise sold by Donald Trump. </p><p>   Mr. Biden seemed unaware of the taunt's meaning, telling the caller, \"I agree.\" Jill Biden, however, rolled her eyes in apparent disgust. </p><p>   In my high-school French class, we would tell our teacher, \"Quelle belle journee,\" which we had all agreed would mean \"This class stinks.\" If nothing else, it brought laughs that Mlle. Donzella could never figure out. </p><p>   Lawmakers know that a reference to \"my friend\" means \"that jerk across the aisle.\" Merchants are fond of using \"convenience fee\" as code for charges that are unfair and inconvenient. </p><p>   In the \"The Money Pit\" (1986), Tom Hanks learns that when contractors say a job will take \"about two weeks,\" it means at least two months. In hospitals, a page for \"Dr. Firestone\" means there's a fire in the building. At sea, \"Code Oscar\" indicates a person overboard. In the air, \"Operation Rising Star\" signals that a passenger has died. </p><p>   In our office I could never understand why my assistant was so frequently asked about the weather. Seems her answers -- cloudy, sunny, etc. -- were code to describe my mood. </p><p>   When my sister, Patricia, begins a sentence, \"No offense, but,\" we know she's about to say something offensive. Some verbal coding is as simple as adding a single letter. If my wife calls out \"Pete,\" I'm fine, but when I hear \"Peter,\" I know I'm in trouble. </p><p>   At a joke-tellers club, everyone already knew all the jokes. Members saved time by calling out jokes by number. When a member hollered, say, \"14,\" everyone laughed. \"Twenty-two\" brought even bigger laughs. Then a new member tried \"22,\" and there was silence. \"What happened?\" he asked. A veteran explained: \"You didn't tell it right.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Mr. Funt is author of \"Self-Amused: A Tell-Some Memoir.\" </p><p></p>",
