  "text": "<p>Chambers's simple, poetic translation contrasts well with the horrors that came after. His translation in no way transformed \"Bambi\" into \"a story for children\": Disney did that. We read his translation as teens: beauty could not hide horror, though Disney cut or trivialized it. Here is something only our family knows: Chambers felt sickened by the story's \"Disneyfication.\"</p><p>Mr. Zipes criticizes Chambers for \"textual infidelity.\" Is the new translation more accurate? Perhaps. Chambers, then 27, was translating a first of 16 books from German and French. But more accurate does not mean better. Translations need artistry and Chambers was also a poet. He understood that simple, beautiful language in \"Bambi\" helped portray the innocence of animals, making human horrors all the starker. I have looked at a few of Mr. Zipes's passages and found them similar -- except where Chambers chose more poetic language.</p><p>David Chambers</p><p>Reston, Va.</p>",
