  "text": "<p>Farewell HelloFresh, goodbye shave club and toodle pip Disney+. Only the coffee subscription remains. Well, that and Netflix obviously. And Spotify, but that's pretty much an essential these days. Oh, and my wife's Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+ and the Deliveroo membership, though now I'm working from home less it is getting harder to justify.</p> <p>We might still have a BritBox sub, come to think of it, though I can't remember why I got it in the first place. It must have been to watch some 1970s drama for which I retained a lingering affection, but obviously not lingering enough for me to now recall what it was. There was briefly a literature club that sent unexpected novels, presumably the ones publishers could not shift, but that seems to have stopped.</p> <p>I have a nagging suspicion there are others out there, hiding in the dark crevices of my current account. There's an Audible subscription I've just remembered. And now you mention it, I might have signed up for extra storage on iCloud. Then again, I might not have.</p> <p>I think that's the lot, aside from all the news organisations and Substack newsletters. Some have expired, though I'm never sure which because I've forgotten all the passwords. The result of this is that I am still a member on some devices but not on others where I failed to save the login details. So if I want to read The Spectator I have to go downstairs to my personal laptop, which is fine when I'm working from home but a bit of a hike when I'm in the office. I know I could resolve most of these issues, but the point is I haven't.</p> <p>The upshot is that significant sums of money are passing out of my account for online services I either no longer need, can't use or do not realise I am still paying for. (Yes, yes, I'm way ahead of you on FT subscription gags but there are some things you can't afford to be without!)</p> <p>Of course, my incompetence or self-indulgence (or both) is a function of affluence. Were I forced to watch every penny I would have tackled this much sooner. The spawn are more efficient, routinely signing up for things and setting reminders to cancel before the free trial period ends. Sadly, I conform to the core demographic these sites are seeking: interested enough to sign up but too stupid to cancel. Now, however, inflation and reports of subscription services like Netflix suffering a drop in demand have prompted an audit.</p>  <p><strong>There are, by the way</strong>, some stonking subscription services. There's one that sends you cuts of zebra and other alternative meats. Another offers underpants by post and one dispatches the ingredients for a grilled cheese sandwich (cheese, bread . . . what am I missing here?). Thank heavens I spotted them only when I was cutting back.</p> <p>The shave club went when the boxes of new razor blades took up an entire shelf of our bathroom cupboard and even signing up to the most infrequent resupply made little dent in the stockpile. During the pandemic people hoarded all kinds of useful things. I hoarded razor blades. But at least whenever I find myself looking at some ridiculous new business and wondering what kind of fool would pay for such a thing, I need only open the bathroom cabinet to find out.</p> <p>The mistake the shave club made was being too visible. Each delivery was a reminder it was time to cancel. The same was true of others I tried on a whim, often in the tedium of lockdown. But the streaming services and subscriptions I don't not use are unobtrusive. Often it is only when I suddenly want to use a service, perhaps with the release of a new television show, that I remember I meant to cancel it. If it weren't for replacement bank cards there would be even more.</p> <p>There's not much to cheer about the cost of living crisis. But if it makes a few more of us question the nonsense we keep buying through inertia and stupidity it will at least have one upside. Then again, perhaps there's a gap for a service where incompetents pay someone to manage their subscriptions. Anyone know a good one? </p> <p><em>Follow Robert on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertshrimsley\"><em>@robertshrimsley</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=robert.shrimsley@ft.com\"><em>robert.shrimsley@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Robert Shrimsley 2022 'Time to change my subscription model' FT.com 1 July.
