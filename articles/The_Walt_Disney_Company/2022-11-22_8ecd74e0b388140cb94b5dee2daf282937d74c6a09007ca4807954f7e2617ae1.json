  "title": "The Thanksgiving Movie Your Family Will Actually Agree On; NASA gave the Mars rover nicknamed Oppy 90 days to survive. It lasted 15 years. A robot's tale of perseverance, in a new documentary called 'Good Night Oppy.'",
  "text": "<p>\"Good Night Oppy\" follows the scientists and engineers who shepherded the rover project from design phase to a tearful send off after Opportunity finally went dark forever. Angela Bassett narrates from Opportunity's \"diary,\" a log of the rover's progress. Because there were no cameras on Mars filming the rover's journey, visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic re-created the environment and a survival saga that involved dust storms, sand traps and frigid Martian winters.</p><p>The film combines sentimentality and science in a way that gives it the potential to connect with a broad audience. Producers include Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. The Amazon Prime Video release recently cleaned up at the Critics Choice Documentary Awards, winning best documentary feature and four other awards. Following a limited run in theaters, the film lands on the Prime Video streaming service Nov. 23 ahead of Thanksgiving, when families go looking for something they can watch together.</p><p>Filmmakers found ways to anthropomorphize Opportunity without getting cartoonish or straying from the scientific core of the story. Director and co-writer Ryan White, whose past projects include documentaries about Dr. Ruth and Serena Williams, said he followed the lead of the rovers' handlers, who, like devoted parents, used the pronouns she and her to describe the robots' challenges and achievements.</p><p>\"We tend to think of scientists and engineers as very rational and practical-thinking people,\" the director said. \"Time and time again, we found them [in interviews] to be very emotional in their connection to these robots.\"</p><p>Spirit and Opportunity explored different areas of Mars but had identical designs. Each rover had a mechanical arm to investigate rocks, and a swiveling head with binocular cameras set at the eye level of a person, allowing the bot to scan the distance.</p><p>\"We designed them that way because they were exploring on our behalf,\" said Jennifer Trosper of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Lifelike qualities also came from the robots' programming, said Ms. Trosper, a JPL project system engineer and mission manager who is featured in \"Good Night Oppy.\" The rovers responded to \"behaviors\" encoded into their computer systems, such as the directive to call home to Earth with daily status reports. The robots acted autonomously to keep themselves safe, like by preserving battery power for the heaters that warmed the rovers.</p><p>\"That led to us letting the ropes go on our teenagers and letting them make their own decisions, which is always a little scary,\" Ms. Trosper said.</p><p>Filmmakers had access to a thousand hours of behind-the-scenes footage shot by NASA film crews. Mr. White and producer Jessica Hargrave mined these archives for exciting and relatable moments, such as the \"wake-up songs\" the rover team played to start the workday and set the mood in the mission control room. In one scene, they crank ABBA's \"SOS\" while working to revive an unresponsive bot.</p><p>At Industrial Light &amp; Magic, about 25 visual effects artists took on an unusual job for a company known for \"Star Wars\" and other big-budget fantasies. Instead of fabricating an imaginary world, they made a computer-generated Mars landscape that appeared photorealistic. They used high-resolution imagery from satellite orbiters to re-create the rovers' surroundings, and referenced NASA data to depict the light conditions and dust levels that existed on days shown in the film.</p><p>In bringing the rovers themselves to life on screen, the mission was to accurately render every physical detail \"down to the screw,\" Mr. White said, \"despite how much fun it would be to put eyebrows on the robot.\"</p><p>Certain rover parts did help make the bots seem expressive. ILM's effects artists created the impression a rover was blinking by moving lens filters inside its eye-like cameras. The range of motion on a rover's head implied a sad nod or perky glance when the scene called for it (with emphasis from music composer Blake Neely and sound designer Mark Mangini).</p><p>\"There was enough to work with there in imbuing them with lots of character,\" said ILM's Jonathan Privett, executive visual effects supervisor on \"Good Night Oppy.\"</p><p>NASA personnel like to point out that their rovers predated \"WALL-E.\" The animated movie about a spunky rolling robot with a telescoping head came out in 2008. But the Pixar creation did have some influence on \"Good Night Oppy.\"</p><p>\"Because people had done 'WALL-E,' we knew a nonspeaking part could work and still be lovable,\" Mr. Privett said.</p><p>Aside from splashy moments like the rovers' landing on Mars, the filmmakers had to build action scenes around machines that crept along the surface at a typical speed of .02 miles an hour.</p><p>\"Nothing the robot does is actually that exciting or adventurous. The riskiest thing it does is slowly climb down into a crater, or climb back up,\" Mr. White said.</p><p>In one cliffhanger sequence, Opportunity bogs down with its wheels spinning in powdery Martian sand, while anxious NASA engineers in Pasadena, Calif., try to help it break free.</p><p>The story's drama comes from \"the people who were living through it with the robot every day,\" Mr. White said, \"and the connection these humans on Earth had to this thing millions of miles away.\"</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at John.Jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>The Thanksgiving Movie Your Family Will Actually Agree On</p>",
