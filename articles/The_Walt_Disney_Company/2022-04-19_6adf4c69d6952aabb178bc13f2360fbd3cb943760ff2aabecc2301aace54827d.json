  "title": "Netflix Hits Its Ceiling; Paid-subscriber decline brings renewed focus on password-sharing as streaming leader seeks to boost revenue",
  "text": "<p>All told, Netflix expects to end the first half of this year with about 7.8 million fewer subscribers than what Wall Street was expecting. And that was taken badly by investors who were braced for slowing growth—not declines. Netflix shares plunged more than 25% in after-hours trading following the results. If the losses still hold by morning, it would equate to the streaming leader shedding more than two-thirds of its market value just since the first of the year.</p><p>Netflix acknowledged the effect of growing competition on its latest results. But the notion of the market leader peaking actually didn't bode well for the long-term growth ambitions of media giants that have flooded into the streaming market. Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery saw their share prices fall between 4% and 5% following Netflix's results. Disney has maintained that its Disney+ service will hit at least 230 million subscribers by the end of its 2024 fiscal year.</p><p>Theoretically, Netflix hasn't topped out. About 56% of respondents to a recent survey by MoffettNathanson and market research firm HarrisX of U.S. broadband households report using the service. But as the market leader which largely pioneered the concept, Netflix faces the natural challenge of winning over those who have likely already heard of it but have so far declined to sign on. It's also now competing in a much more crowded field—with media giants that own libraries of better-known film and TV content. In its shareholder letter Tuesday, Netflix named competition as one of \"four main inter-related factors\" affecting its growth.</p><p>Hence, Netflix is going to focus on wringing more out of its base. The company acknowledged Tuesday that password sharing is a huge problem, with more than 100 million other households using accounts owned by the nearly 222 million existing subscribers. Netflix is already testing programs to convert some of these viewers to paid viewers, and it said Tuesday this represents \"a large short- to mid-term opportunity.\" But converting freeloaders is less attractive when there are fewer subscribers left to mooch from.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Hits Its Ceiling</p>",
