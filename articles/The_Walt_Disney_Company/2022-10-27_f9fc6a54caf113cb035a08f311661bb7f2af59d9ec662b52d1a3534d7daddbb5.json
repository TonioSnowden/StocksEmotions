  "text": "<p>   ESPN has sold its controlling interest in the X Games, the extreme-sports competition franchise, to private-equity firm MSP Sports Capital. </p><p>   MSP Sports will hold a majority stake in the X Games and handle day-to-day operations of the competition, the companies said. ESPN will retain a minority stake and continue to broadcast the X Games under a multiyear agreement. Walt Disney Co. owns ESPN. </p><p>   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed. </p><p>   Founded in the 1990s, the X Games introduced extreme sports to mainstream audiences, with events including competitive skateboarding, snowboarding and freestyle BMX. </p><p>   \"We're proud of what we've created with our employees and the athletes over nearly 30 years of world-class X Games events and content,\" Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN and sports content, said in a statement. </p><p>   MSP has previously made investments in four European soccer teams as well as McLaren Racing Ltd., the British motor-racing team. </p><p>   Jahm Najafi, chairman of MSP, said the firm will use its sports expertise to bring new energy to the X Games brand. </p><p>   The acquisition highlights the growing trend of investment firms seeking to capitalize on sports. Several firms have formed in recent years specializing in sports-related deals. </p><p>   MSP also said it named Steven Flisler as chief executive of the X Games. Mr. Flisler recently served as vice president of original content at Twitch, the streaming platform owned by Amazon.com Inc. </p><p>   Skateboarding legend Tony Hawk, who has 10 gold medals from the X Games, was named a brand steward for the competition. Mr. Hawk made history at the 1999 X Games when he executed a 900-degree, 2 1/2-turn twist, after attempting it for 12 years. </p><p>   \"Being part of the advisory board for X Games is an extension of my decades of competing and much more forgiving to the body,\" Mr. Hawk said. </p><p>   The next X Games will take place in Aspen, Colo., in January. </p><p></p>",
