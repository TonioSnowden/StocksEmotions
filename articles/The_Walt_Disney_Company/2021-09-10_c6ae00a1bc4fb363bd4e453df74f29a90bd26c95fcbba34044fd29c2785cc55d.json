  "title": "Biden Defends Vaccine Mandates as GOP Criticizes New Rules for Businesses, Workers; Some Republicans threaten to sue over administration's latest plan; president calls them 'cavalier' in regard to public health",
  "text": "<p>On Thursday, Mr. Biden unveiled a sweeping new approach to Covid-19, requiring vaccinations for employees of many private-sector businesses, healthcare personnel and federal contractors, with a goal of covering about 100 million workers, or two-thirds of all workers in the U.S. His six-part plan, which also includes efforts to improve access to testing and make Covid-19 treatments more widely available, comes amid a surge in infections and increase in hospitalizations and deaths.</p><p>The White House had previously shied away from vaccine mandates, but is now framing the push as necessary to boost vaccinations given the continuing resistance from some of the population.</p><p>Jeff Zients, Mr. Biden's Covid-19 coordinator, said the highly transmissible Delta variant had changed the landscape and that the administration believed the new requirements would offer a pathway out of the pandemic while also helping schools and the U.S. economy stay open.</p><p>\"We know that vaccination requirements work,\" Mr. Zients told reporters at a Friday briefing. \"Vaccination requirements are the current standard employed by so many corporations. The president's actions will accelerate that number.\"</p><p>The effort drew swift condemnation from Republicans, with governors in a number of GOP-led states vowing to take legal action.</p><p>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted Thursday: \"Rest assured, we will fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted: \"I will pursue every legal option available to the state of Georgia to stop this blatantly unlawful overreach by the Biden administration.\" The Republican National Committee also said it would sue to stop the vaccine mandate on employers.</p><p>On court challenges, Mr. Biden said Friday: \"Have at it.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden took an aggressive stance against resistant governors Thursday, saying he was taking on \"elected officials and states that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions.\" He pledged that \"if these governors won't help us beat the pandemic, I'll use my power as president to get them out of the way.\"</p><p>The plan also drew criticism from some unions. American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley said in a statement: \"We have said that changes like this should be negotiated with our bargaining units where appropriate. Put simply, workers deserve a voice in their working conditions.\"</p><p>Under Mr. Biden's plan, all employers with 100 or more employees would have to require that their workers be vaccinated or undergo at least weekly Covid-19 testing, covering about 80 million workers. The administration also plans to require vaccinations for workers in most healthcare settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as federal employees in the executive branch and government contractors.</p><p>Some business groups have expressed support for the plan. In a statement, Business Roundtable President Joshua Bolten said the group \"welcomes the Biden administration's continued vigilance in the fight against COVID.\"</p><p>Other business organizations said they were still looking to understand the new requirements. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement: \"The Chamber will carefully review the details of the executive orders and associated regulations and will work to ensure that employers have the resources, guidance, and flexibility necessary to ensure the safety of their employees and customers and comply with public health requirements.\"</p><p>Companies including United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc. are requiring all employees to be vaccinated. Others, such as Walmart Inc., McDonald's Corp. and Walt Disney Co., have said certain groups, such as managers or white-collar workers, need to take the shot. Many hospital groups and colleges and universities have also moved to require vaccinations.</p><p>To impose the mandates, the Biden administration is relying on its powers under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Emergency Temporary Standards code, which allows it to immediately enact a rule if \"workers are in grave danger due to exposure to toxic substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or to new hazards.\"</p><p>That regulation is enacted for six months until a final rule that goes through usual rule-making procedures can be approved. In the past, the agency has faced litigation over some of its emergency temporary standards.</p><p>Cases and hospitalizations have been rising in many states, data show, and public-health experts said the return of unvaccinated schoolchildren to classrooms and other factors could give the virus new opportunities to spread. About half of the nation is fully vaccinated.</p><p>The plan also includes measures for schools, where outbreaks in some places already have led buildings to shut down or children to be quarantined.</p><p>All of the almost 300,000 educators who work in Head Start, a federal program providing early childhood education and other services, will have to be vaccinated under Mr. Biden's plan. The Department of Education will make additional funding available to schools if they have funding jeopardized or pulled by state leaders who have prohibited Covid-19 measures such as testing and masks. And Mr. Biden on Thursday urged governors to call for vaccinations of all schoolteachers and staff.</p><p>At the middle school on Friday, Mr. Biden urged parents of kids over 12 to get them vaccinated and made a promise to the students, saying: \"Once you all get vaccinated you're invited to a special visit to the White House.\"</p><p>Write to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com and Sabrina Siddiqui at Sabrina.Siddiqui@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Defends Vaccine Mandates as GOP Criticizes New Rules for Businesses, Workers</p>",
