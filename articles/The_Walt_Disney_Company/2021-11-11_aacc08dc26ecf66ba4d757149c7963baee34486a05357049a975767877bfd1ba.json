  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, in contrast, lost nearly 160 points, or 0.4%, pulled down, in part, by Walt Disney's worst daily performance in more than a year.</p><p>Investors for months have been digesting signs of mounting inflation, but on Wednesday new data presented the most staggering figures yet. The Labor Department said the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—increased 6.2% in October year-over-year. That marked the quickest 12-month pace since 1990 and the fifth consecutive month of inflation above 5%.</p><p>It was the biggest challenge so far to the idea that rising prices will be temporary and concentrated. Wednesday's data showed that price increases were broad-based. Stocks fell, with technology companies in particular taking losses. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note posted its largest rise in a year. Yields rise when bond prices decline.</p><p>On Thursday, however, there were signs that investors were once again taking the inflation reading in stride. Growth and technology stocks, which tend to perform poorly in an inflationary environment, rebounded. Netflix gained 2.5%, while Advanced Micro Devices jumped 4.1%.</p><p>Financial companies, which tend to benefit from higher interest rates, rallied. Energy and materials stocks also posted strong performances. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks rose 0.9%.</p><p>Wednesday's slide was a \"well-deserved pullback\" after an autumn stock-market rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 to a stretch of repeated records, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. \"Economic growth is still quite solid, and that's going to drive longer-term stock-market gains. We think the underlying fundamentals that got us here are still in place, and that's what investors need to keep in mind.\"</p><p>Even as pricing pressures remain top of mind for strategists and investors, many say they have a bullish outlook for the rest of the year. Stocks are coming out of a strong earnings season, during which about 81% of reporting S&amp;P 500 companies beat earnings expectations, according to FactSet data through Thursday morning. Investors say commentary in recent earnings calls gave them confidence that many companies can navigate inflationary pressures.</p><p>Meanwhile, the market is also entering a seasonally strong period around the holidays. Some investors also believe that current price pressures will abate.</p><p>\"I still think there's a significant cohort of investors who believe that if this [CPI] number is not the peak, it's likely going to peak out soon,\" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for North Carolina-based Cornerstone Wealth.</p><p>In the meantime, some investors are rotating into cyclical stocks that can benefit from economic growth and rising inflation. Many money managers still see the U.S. stock market as one of the best places for sizable and steady returns.</p><p>In corporate news, Rivian Automotive rallied 18% Thursday, adding to its 29% jump when the electric-vehicle company started trading Wednesday.</p><p>Tesla pulled back 0.4%. Regulatory filings showed Elon Musk sold $5 billion of shares in the auto maker earlier in the week. Twitter users directed the chief executive to sell 10% of his stake in the company, valued at $21 billion, in an online poll last weekend.</p><p>Walt Disney fell 6.9% after it reported a slowdown in subscriber growth as lockdowns eased Wednesday. Plant-based meat company Beyond Meat lost 14% after it posted a disappointing revenue forecast, citing pandemic-related uncertainty on demand.</p><p>The U.S. bond market was closed Thursday for the Veterans Day holiday.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.3% to finish with a new record close.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index added 1.2%, while the Hang Seng Index climbed 1%. Shares of Chinese developers rallied on indications that Beijing might moderate its tough property-sector rules. China Evergrande Group made another set of last-minute bond payments, averting default.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Finish Higher After Inflation Readout</p>",
