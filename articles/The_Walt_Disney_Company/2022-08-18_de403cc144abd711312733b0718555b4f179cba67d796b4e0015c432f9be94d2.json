  "text": "<p>Watching <em>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, </em>you might start wondering where the Marvel Cinematic Universe could go next. Hawkeye: Tennis Umpire? Spider-Man: Web Designer? A franchise based on a hero called Ombudsman?</p> <p>This new nine-part Disney Plus series seeks to bring Marvel's cosmic shenanigans back down to earth with its tale of Jen Walters (Tatiana Maslany) — a thirtysomething who is not only a high-powered lawyer but also a super-powered, green-skinned creature. Billed as a “legal comedy”, the show seems to be making a play for entry-level viewers searching for an offbeat sitcom as well as catering to fans of the studio's lighter offerings. </p> <p>The series begins by showcasing what a Hulk does best: smashing things. First, the patriarchy — as Jen dismisses a chauvinistic colleague who suggests that he carries more sway with juries — then the fourth wall. By having her address the audience directly, the show remains true to the self-aware tone of the original comic books, while also aligning itself with the cool, sardonic humour of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/443bcecc-35c9-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812\"><em>Fleabag</em></a> (a key influence, according to the writers).</p> <p>Not that Jen is quite as destructive as Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, despite being an actual outsized monster. In fact, unlike her more famous cousin Bruce Banner (also known as <em>the </em>Hulk), she has a natural instinct for controlling her rage. In a flashback-oriented first episode in which we learn how Jen was transformed, we see Bruce (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1b23b228-12a5-34b7-996b-1f11aa254c40\">Mark Ruffalo</a>) trying to coach her in how to regulate her emotions through “dialectical behavioural therapy”. She points out that, as a woman, she's already had a lifetime of practice keeping her feelings in check to avoid “getting called difficult or getting murdered”.</p> <p>Much of the opener focuses on the rest of Bruce's mentorship programme, which includes physical conditioning, gentle banter and several stern lectures about responsibility. So far, so uninspiring. And Jen, it seems, would agree. Arguing that she's still at her most formidable in the courtroom, and that vigilantism is for “billionaires, narcissists and adult orphans”, she chooses to fight injustice at a firm that has hired her to lead the “superhuman law division”.</p> <p>Watching a superhero mired in everyday life — going to work, going on dates, carrying out chores — provides some mild, breezy amusement, and there's a certain punchiness in how the show skewers the treatment of powerful women in the workplace and the media. But the series also seems comfortable coasting on its goofy premise. For all of She-Hulk's strength, it's a shame that predictable gags and tiresome meta-humour do most of the heavy lifting.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Disney Plus now; new episodes air weekly</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'She-Hulk: Attorney at Law review — Marvel superhero series coasts on its goofy premise' FT.com 18 August.
