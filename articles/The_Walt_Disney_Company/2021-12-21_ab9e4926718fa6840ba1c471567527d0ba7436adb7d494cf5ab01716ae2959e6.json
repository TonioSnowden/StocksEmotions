  "text": "<p>My brother, Jonathan, is three years younger and was the much-longed-for boy. He was gorgeous, and my mother adored him. We all adored him. So Mom focused on him and dealing with Juliet.</p><p>This double distraction left me lots of space to be in my own world, riding my pony, Annabelle, and spending time being me. I quickly wound up with a vivid imagination, and my games went on all day undisturbed.</p><p>My father was stage and film actor Sir John Mills, who won an Oscar and was revered in Britain and America. My mother, Mary, was a writer with a marvelous imagination who was pragmatic and grounded.</p><p>Our first house was just outside London in a village called Denham. I don't remember it much except for falling down the stairs and practically biting my tongue off.</p><p>Then we lived in a house in London's Chelsea, where my brother was born. That was a very traditional old-fashioned English setting with nannies and prams and a nursery.</p><p>The next house I remember well. Our small Georgian mansion with a terraced garden was on top of London's Richmond Hill. We could see the River Thames snaking through the landscape off in the distance.</p><p>We lived there for about seven years. Then my father bought a flat in London's Mayfair. He also bought a farm in Sussex. I was 10. The farm had 400 acres, Guernsey cows, a duck pond and a Dutch barn. We lived in the 14th-century farmhouse with no central heating.</p><p>In Sussex, Dad became the farmer, and loved walking the land in his Wellington boots. We were all given sheathed knives, which we hung on our belts, and whittled wood like mad.</p><p>Moving so often didn't interfere with my social life. From the time each of us turned 10, we were sent to boarding school, where friendships bloomed.</p><p>Visiting my father on play and movie sets was wonderful. Acting had such an excitement and magic to it. Everything smelled like wood shavings from newly built sets.</p><p>I read a great deal as a child. When home at the farm, I climbed the chestnut tree in front of our house with my books and comics. It was my hiding place.</p><p>We also watched TV, which was quite new in British households in 1958. When ads came on, I memorized the lines and jingles and performed them for the cows, the dog and anyone who was around.</p><p>One day, when I was 12, director J. Lee Thompson came up to the farm to talk to my father about \"Tiger Bay,\" a film he was planning that Dad was going to star in. They talked about the need to cast a boy. When my father advised J. Lee to find him fast, J. Lee said he already had. He pointed at me. He had been watching me do silly ad impressions. They reworked the script so the character was a girl.</p><p>Shifting into acting wasn't a stretch for me. Though I was a clumsy child, I was very energetic and madly enthusiastic about everything. I was very much in my own little dreamworld.</p><p>In America, Walt Disney's senior producer, Bill Anderson, saw \"Tiger Bay\" and loved my performance. He cast me as the lead in \"Pollyanna.\" I was just happy to be in warm Hollywood. Mommy and Daddy were with me, and so was my brother.</p><p>When Walt offered me the role in \"The Parent Trap,\" I thought playing two kids with a split screen would be fun. The roles didn't frighten me. I felt, \"If they think I can do it, then I can.\"</p><p>My father was still the star of our family. My mother wanted to be with him and he wanted her with him. When I started working, that became an obstacle because she was torn between the two of us. My parents were aware that too much attention can cause you to expect it all the time. They kept an eye on that with me.</p><p>Read More House Call Columns</p><p>* 'And Just Like Thatâ€¦' Actress Kristin Davis Went From Wallflower to Hippie Theater Kid</p><p>* 'The Office' Star Brian Baumgartner Had an Un-Kevin Way of Making Career Plans</p><p>* Wikipedia Co-Founder Jimmy Wales Was Educated in a One-Room Schoolhouse</p><p>Today, I live in an Edwardian house in a village in southwest London. I love that I can see the river from the kitchen.</p><p>Children who see the original \"Parent Trap\" and \"Whistle Down the Wind,\" based on my mother's novel, still write me, and so do adults. It's one of my life's great gifts, that people were deeply touched by those films. They tell me I'm part of their childhood, that the films I made still help through tough times.</p><p>I'm amazed that people remember my movies and that they have survived. I suppose the good things do survive, don't they?</p><p>Hayley's Comet</p><p>Where were you when you won an Oscar for \"Pollyanna\"? Fast asleep in a cold room at boarding school.</p><p>Disappointed you missed it? I didn't know what a big deal the Academy was until later.</p><p>When did it hit you? In 2003, when I was invited to participate in the Academy Awards' 75th Past Oscar Winner Reunion.</p><p>What happened? The curtain went up, and 59 of us were sitting there. I thought, \"My God, I'm here with all the stars.\"</p><p>Hayley Mills Avoided Her Own 'Parent Trap' by Reading in Trees</p>",
