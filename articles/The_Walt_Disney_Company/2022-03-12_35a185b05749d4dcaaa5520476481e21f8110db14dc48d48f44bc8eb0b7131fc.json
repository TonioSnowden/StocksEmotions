  "title": "REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial):  Does the 'Don't Say Gay' Bill Say That?",
  "text": "<p>   Opponents call it Florida's \"don't say gay\" bill, and the political branding seems to have worked, given how the mainstream press laundered that charged phrase into a national rallying cry. The legislation passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday, and it now awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis's signature. </p><p>   What does the seven-page bill actually do? One section says schools generally \"may not discourage or prohibit parental notification of and involvement in critical decisions affecting a student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being.\" Parents also can't be blocked from \"education and health records created, maintained, or used by the school.\" </p><p>   Another section says: \"Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate.\" Parents who think the law isn't being followed could ask for the appointment of a magistrate to review the dispute. Or they could sue to get a declaratory judgment and attorney fees. </p><p>   To millions of parents, this no doubt sounds noncontroversial. Their children's mental health and school records are eminently their business. Kindergartners are supposed to be learning how to read and peaceably resolve turf wars over Tonka trucks. To their tiny ears, \"sexual orientation\" is a string of silly nonsense syllables. The bill says older children could be taught \"age-appropriate\" material. </p><p>   Moreover, the curriculum rule would appear to have no immediate effect. \"In practice,\" the Tampa Bay Times reports, \"it is unclear exactly how things will change in the classroom because sexual orientation and gender identity is not something that is being taught in grades K-3 at the moment.\" If that's the case, then why is everybody so riled up? </p><p>   Earlier versions of the bill said that primary schools could not \"encourage classroom discussion\" about sexual orientation. Critics said this was vague. What if a teacher asked students to draw and describe their families, and one had two moms? Last month the House revised its bill to target \"classroom instruction,\" a narrower phrase. \"The idea that we would ban a specific conversation a child is having about their parent is impossible,\" the legislative sponsor said. </p><p>   Yet the narrative train was speeding down the track already. Some reporters this week are still blithely quoting the wrong version of the bill. A Democratic lawmaker invokes \"1984\" and claims: \"Not only might teachers be punished for allowing classroom discussion about a student's own family structure, but children with LGBTQ+ family members will be ostracized and shamed.\" </p><p>   White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed that maybe the bill's sponsors want to hurt children. \"Why are Florida leaders deciding they need to discriminate against kids who are members of the LGBTQI community?\" she said. \"Is it meanness? Is it wanting to make kids have more difficult times in school?\" Disney's CEO was buffaloed into taking a public stance against the legislation, which satisfied no one. </p><p>   None of this criticism is true. The legislation is a response to public-school educators who think parents should stay out of school decisions. But parents have a right to ensure that the curriculum is age appropriate, and that it is focused on learning instead of promoting someone's cultural agenda. The bill lets them vindicate parental authority. </p><p>   The bigger lesson is that even modest conservative pushback on cultural issues will be met by a firestorm. The overwrought reaction shows why the bill passed. </p><p></p>",
