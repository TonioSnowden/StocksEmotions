  "title": "Business News:  Disney CEO's Pay More Than Doubled  ----  By Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co. paid CEO Bob Chapek $32.5 million in total compensation for 2021, his first full calendar year at the helm of the entertainment and media conglomerate. </p><p>   Nearly half of Mr. Chapek's pay came in the form of a $14.3 million cash bonus, according to a company filing Wednesday. The award shows Disney has revived giving out non-equity bonuses after suspending them in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the company's revenue. Mr. Chapek's total compensation last year more than doubled the $14.2 million he earned in 2020. </p><p>   Shortly after taking the reins as chief executive in February 2020 from longtime chief Robert Iger, Mr. Chapek took a steep pay cut. In March 2020 as the pandemic forced theme parks to close and kept moviegoers at home, Disney's share price fell to $85.76, its lowest level in nearly six years. It has since recovered, closing at $147.62 Thursday, due in part to the rise of the Disney+ streaming service and the reopening of the company's theme parks last year. </p><p>   In addition to the cash bonus, Mr. Chapek received a base salary of $2.5 million, stock and option awards valued at nearly $14 million and other compensation, including a change in the value of his pension, worth $1.7 million, according to the filing. </p><p>   Disney has historically offered some of the highest executive pay packages in the U.S. In 1993, then-CEO Michael Eisner earned $203.1 million in total compensation, at the time the highest pay package ever for the chief executive of a public company. In 2019, his final full year as Disney's chief, Mr. Iger earned $47.5 million, making him the highest-paid executive at a U.S. media company. </p><p>   After stepping down as chief executive, Mr. Iger still out-earned Mr. Chapek in 2021. Disney paid Mr. Iger, who served as executive chairman through the end of last year, $45.9 million in total compensation, including a $3 million base salary, a $22.9 million cash bonus and stock and options awards worth $18.8 million. </p><p>   The two top executives at Netflix Inc., Disney's largest competitor in streaming entertainment, co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings, earned $39.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively, in total compensation for 2020, the most recent year for which pay data is available. In a December regulatory filing, Netflix said it would pay Mr. Hastings more than $34 million and Mr. Sarandos $40 million in 2022. </p><p></p>",
