  "title": "Brian Robbins Expected to Take Over Leadership of Paramount Movie Studio; Mr. Robbins, head of Nickelodeon, will replace Jim Gianopulos, as ViacomCBS aims to beef up original content on Paramount+",
  "text": "<p>An announcement could come as soon as next week, people briefed on the matter said.</p><p>The promotion of Mr. Robbins, 57, continues a meteoric rise for the former actor turned producer and executive at the company. He was tapped to head Nickelodeon less than three years ago. Before that he headed Paramount Players, a production arm that produced content for ViacomCBS's array of cable networks including MTV and BET.</p><p>The move also comes as ViacomCBS's Ms. Redstone takes a greater role in the day-to-day operations of the media giant. Ms. Redstone was instrumental in this latest elevation, people familiar with the situation said. Ms. Redstone is said to be impressed with Mr. Robbins' producing chops and his ability to tap into younger audiences, which will be key for ViacomCBS's streaming ambitions, people close to the pair said.</p><p>Driving the decision to add the movie studio to Mr. Robbins's growing fiefdom is a desire to beef up original content on Paramount+, the ViacomCBS streaming service, which is competing against much bigger rivals in Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and AT&amp;T Inc.'s HBOMax.</p><p>A well-regarded Hollywood veteran, Mr. Gianopulos previously ran the 20th Century Fox studio. At Paramount he is credited with the horror franchise \"A Quiet Place,\" which has spawned two hit movies. He also signed lucrative licensing deals to sell Paramount movies to outside platforms including \"Coming 2 America\" and \"The Tomorrow War\" to Amazon Prime. Revenue grew 3% at Paramount in the second quarter.</p><p>After getting his start in international distribution, Mr. Gianopulos rose to become a Hollywood fixture, known for charming directors like James Cameron and stars like Tom Cruise. His house has been the location of see-and-be-seen parties around the Academy Awards.</p><p>Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com</p><p>Brian Robbins Expected to Take Over Leadership of Paramount Movie Studio</p>",
