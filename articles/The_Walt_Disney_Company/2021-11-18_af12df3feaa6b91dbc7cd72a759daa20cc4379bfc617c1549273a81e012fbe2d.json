  "title": "'The Great' Season 2 Review: The Winter Palace Heats Up; The Hulu series, very loosely based on the life of Catherine the Great, returns",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Hulu</p><p>What hangs over the second-season debut of the series—an \"occasionally true story\" about Catherine the Great (Elle Fanning)—is whether the show could maintain its often delicious balance of the elegant and the vulgar, the decorous and the disgusting, the carnal and the carnivorous. Based on the Australian writer Tony McNamara's play and scripted largely by him, the inaugural \"Great\" maintained an edge despite hinging largely on one joke, or maybe one surprise: that the lushly costumed people of 18th-century St. Petersburg—inhabiting the Winter Palace as well as a tumultuous era in feudal history—might talk like they were in a David Mamet play and act like rutting beasts. It was like \"Bridgerton\" on the Volga.</p><p>Amusing, yes, and it continues to be. Mr. McNamara's dialogue relies on keeping his viewer off-balance, the regal playing off the ridiculous, or the barbaric. He has said in interviews that he wanted a long-form outlet for the ideas in his play, which he felt were too contained, historically speaking. And while season 2 does feel a bit static—a successful formula inevitably becomes formulaic—he does have many fertile places to go: It's a very pregnant Catherine we meet as the show resumes. (\"If God really loved women,\" she says, \"we'd lay eggs.\")</p><p>Her coup against her \"idiot\" husband (the real Catherine's description of Peter III, played by Nicholas Hoult) has stalled because she couldn't bring herself to kill him in season 1 and was betrayed by her maid, the once and future member of the nobility Marial (a terrific Phoebe Fox). Marial had been desperate to be noble again and wanted to protect the Rasputin-like archbishop, nicknamed Archie (Adam Godley), who is a scheming wretch. How do she and Catherine make out?</p><p>We have been forewarned: \"The Great\" is based on actual history the way \"Star Wars,\" for instance, is based on actual science. There was a Catherine, of course, considered the greatest Russian empress as well as the last. Peter the Not-So-Great, whom Mr. Hoult plays as delightfully depraved, debauched and of woefully diminished intellect, was perhaps treated unfairly by history, though much of that history was written by his wife. As a comedic character, Peter III is singular: His appetites rule him, his self-esteem is inexplicably unimpaired despite being forced toward abdication by his far smarter and strategically gifted spouse—she knows he'll fold if he can't get a decent meal and prepares whole roast pig outside his hideout, the aroma of apples, marjoram and cognac demolishing his royal resolve.</p><p>Mr. Hoult is playing an appalling character and making him a delight. Peter has decided he really does love Catherine, the former Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg of Prussia, who became Catherine II and who, as played by Ms. Fanning, is sweetly peach-cheeked and tough as a reindeer steak. Peter relates to her a dream he had, in which they die in each other's arms (the details are far more graphic, but that's the gist). \"I had a dream,\" she responds, \"where I dropped you down a well. I thought it was full of boiling water, but it turned out to be full of angry, starving bears.\" The future looks far brighter for Russia than it does for Peter.</p><p>'The Great' Season 2 Review: The Winter Palace Heats Up</p>",
