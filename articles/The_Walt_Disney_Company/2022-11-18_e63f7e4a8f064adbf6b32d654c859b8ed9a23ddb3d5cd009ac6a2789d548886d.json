  "text": "<p><strong>How can we decorate our new chalet in a cosy way without resorting to clichés?</strong></p> <p>Earlier this year I spent a few days in the picturesque Austrian town of Lech, which sits about two and a half hours east of Zurich. I was there for work, visiting a hotel, but I did manage to squeeze in a couple of hours on the slopes.</p> <p>One bright, freezing morning, my husband Duncan jumped merrily into a cable car and waved me off before ascending to the highest local peak (turns out he's a very good snowboarder), as I slowly waddled (feeling peaky in very much the other sense) in the direction of the baby slopes, an instructor 10 paces in front.</p> <p>Once I could move in a semi-forward direction without falling I enjoyed myself, I have to admit, but I enjoyed even more basking in the town's magnificence: the surrounding mountains, of course, but also the architecture. There's a reason the US photographer Slim Aarons snapped Lech in the 1960s, looking as it does like the ultimate snowy fantasy.</p> <p>The historic Gasthof Post hotel, a fixture of the town, was bought in 1937 by Erich and Irma Moosbrugger. In 1972 it went through an extensive makeover and acquired its pale pink facade. (Alas, I can never resist a pink hotel.) Originally a farmhouse, the Post is a cosy mix of much wood, painted furniture and exquisite antiques.</p> <p>Sitting at the hotel's bar one evening, drink in hand, I was beguiled, and soon got to thinking about how my own mountain home might look.</p> <p>Now, I know you don't wish to “resort” to clichés, but here's the thing: a cliché is a cliché for a reason, and while you may not want to go down the Disney fairytale route (and I'm not sure that I would want to either), I really do believe that your best solution would be to not ignore stereotypes altogether but to embrace a few. Crucially, then, it's going to be about how you work with those stereotypes, and what else you decide to include in your scheme.</p> <p>An example: I stayed at the Fife Arms hotel in Scotland's Braemar in August, and while there were lashings of tartan and several stuffed salmon peering at me open-mouthed in the bar, there were also Picassos on the walls and various contemporary art installations going on in corridors, above staircases and across entire rooms. The mix was fun, and besides, why wouldn't one want to see tartan carpets in the Highlands?</p> <p>When decorative elements, furniture and art help us to feel more grounded in a place, truly there and ensconced, I'm all for them. This is precisely why I dislike bland international hotel design. When I'm in a fabulous place, I want my interior surroundings to reflect the reasons that make it fabulous. I want to really feel everything on some deep, delicious level: obviously I want tartan carpets, I want all the bells and whistles!</p> <p>So, where to look for inspiration for your new chalet? The interior design company <a href=\"https://mhzlondon.com/project_category/chalets/\">Mlinaric, Henry and Zervudachi</a> have worked on many chalets, some more traditional than others but all utterly sublime. One ski home that the company decorated would be very interesting for you to look at I think. Inside there are several classic chalet tricks: gorgeously patterned knotted pine on the walls and ceilings; snowy sheepskins thrown over dining chairs; an insanely beautiful fireplace made from stones plucked from a local riverbed. So far, so romantic.</p> <p>The furniture, however, is decidedly modern, the colour palette restrained. A peek at the kitchen reveals a sea of stainless steel. No frilly checked tablecloths here. My favourite feature of all might just be the sitting room's electric grass green rug, which, as Tino Zervudachi explained to House &amp; Garden magazine, is “like the green of the mountains in summer”.</p> <p>To me, this is a really excellent example of what I'm getting at: take a huge dose of inspiration from your surroundings, research and respect your building's history, local materials and design tropes, but don't feel enslaved.</p> <p>Personally, I love the idea of lots of wood (come on, surely this is one stereotype that would be absolutely impossible to ignore), and a mix of furniture and accessories from different periods. I'm thinking . . . shaggy rugs, a few bits of charming Tyrolean painted furniture, acres of heavy corduroy, check fabrics in shocking colours. I see a mash-up of 1960s Bavaria and 18th-century Austria, perhaps? A dash of 1970s Colorado? Rustic-decadent?</p> <p>Certainly a ski chalet is at the top of my list of ultimate buildings to decorate. (Yes, this is a real list.) I suppose I ought to book in that second lesson . . . I'm hoping next time I'll be able to catch up with the kindergarten class.</p> <p><em>If you have a question for Luke about design and stylish living, email him at </em><a href=\"mailto:lukeedward.hall@ft.com\"><em>lukeedward.hall@ft.com</em></a><em>.
