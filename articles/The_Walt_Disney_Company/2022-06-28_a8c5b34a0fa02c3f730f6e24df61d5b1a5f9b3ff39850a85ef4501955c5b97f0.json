  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- Shanghai is emerging from a monthslong Covid-induced lockdown, but for many companies across China, it still isn't business as usual because of concerns about future lockdowns. </p><p>   Economists and business executives say the recent cycle of pandemic restrictions will paralyze future decisions and consumer activity as leader Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his commitment to crushing outbreaks with strict regulations. </p><p>   Shanghai Disneyland was shut on March 21 as municipal authorities tried to contain the then-fast-spreading outbreak, and the park hasn't reopened following the lifting of some citywide restrictions, which began June 1. Some executives fear a single infection among park guests could mean a shutdown, according to people familiar with the matter. In October, Shanghai Disneyland was forced to suspend operations, locking 30,000 visitors inside the park, after a guest tested positive. </p><p>   A Shanghai Disney Resort spokeswoman declined to comment on when the park would reopen. The Shanghai government didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   In Shanghai and across China, thousands more businesses are wrestling with similar Covid-related challenges. Less investment means fewer jobs created, which in turn hits spending and investment. </p><p>   That spiral risks undermining Beijing's efforts to salvage the economy from a bruising two-month lockdown in Shanghai, a continuing property slump and global supply-chain shudders from the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine. </p><p>   \"The longer the strict pandemic policy lasts, the weaker business sentiment will turn,\" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at investment bank Nomura, who recently lowered his Chinese growth forecast this year to 3.3% from 3.9% -- below China's official target of roughly 5.5% expansion. </p><p>   The government's aggressive testing plan raises the possibility of further lockdowns, even after Shanghai's top official, Communist Party chief Li Qiang, declared Saturday that the city had \"won the battle\" against the latest outbreak. </p><p>   Shanghai health authorities have ordered the city's 25 million people to undergo mass Covid testing each weekend until the end of July amid rising caseloads. Some residential compounds have been sealed off again for weeks, just days after they were reopened from months of lockdown. </p><p>   For analysts like Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, a concern is whether the recurring Covid lockdowns lead to \"permanent scarring,\" with prolonged periods of elevated joblessness among service-sector workers. </p><p>   Another risk is that foreign businesses will reassess their commitment to the country. </p><p></p>",
