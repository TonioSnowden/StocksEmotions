  "text": "<p>In October, the city that never sleeps will greet a new dawn for the arts. After a major redevelopment during the pandemic, David Geffen Hall, home of the New York Philharmonic, is due to reopen at Lincoln Center. The photos released in advance look impressive and there is understandable pride that the project has been completed on budget and two years ahead of schedule (work was accelerated during the pandemic).</p> <p>After being hit so hard by Covid, the city is turning its eyes to the future. Not only is there a largely new hall, but the New York Philharmonic is also launching an imaginative programme for the opening season, arguably the most eye-catching of any major international orchestra.</p> <p>The season will focus on issues at the top of the current affairs agenda. There will be four themes: “Earth” will look at the climate crisis through premieres by Julia Wolfe and pioneering American nature composer John Luther Adams; “Spirit” will appeal to the spiritual in humanity and nature, focusing on music by Bach and Messiaen; “Liberation” explores the national dialogue on racial equality prompted by the murder of George Floyd, with composers Courtney Bryan and, in a big multimedia evening, Adolphus Hailstork; and “Home” will look back at the pandemic and what homes came to mean to us during the lockdown.</p> <p>A key player behind all this activity is Deborah Borda, president and chief executive of the New York Philharmonic, and it may be no coincidence that, only weeks after the unveiling of the completed David Geffen Hall, the news broke that she will leave her post at the end of June 2023. Borda, a living legend among American arts administrators, will become executive adviser to the orchestra's president and board of directors.</p> <p>“This is New York's orchestra,” she says. “That is our message. The people who gave us the money for the new hall were not necessarily music-lovers, but they were great citizens of New York. We put forward the argument that this is a critical moment for the city to demonstrate its resilience and spirit. I believe the future for the arts in the US lies in individual philanthropy, because the quest for return on investment at corporations these days makes it really tough going. What individual donors want to see is a vibrant organisation of the moment.”</p> <p>With so much on offer, the NY Phil needs the new David Geffen Hall to draw in audiences, and two central aims of the $550mn redevelopment should help. Opened in 1962, originally as Philharmonic Hall, later renamed Avery Fisher Hall, this is a venue that was never loved for its acoustics. Reducing the capacity from 2,700 seats to 2,200 is said to have found a “sweet spot” and there is much anticipation for the quality of sound when the hall reopens.</p> <p>The second objective, which Borda is energetic in promoting, is making the hall more welcoming. There is now a wider range of possibilities, including amplified music, staged performances and film screenings. A new studio space looks directly out on to the corner of 65th Street and Broadway and a 50-foot screen in the lobby will enable visitors to watch concerts for free.</p> <p>“It is very important to our partners at Lincoln Center and to our philosophy that we invite people in,” she says. “We are not an Acropolis on the hill that people are afraid to approach. During the pandemic, when we could not give concerts inside, our bandwagon took music out to the people. We drove our truck around the five boroughs of New York and gave over 80 concerts. That made us a lot of community connections, like National Black Theatre and Mother AME Zion Church.”</p> <p>Borda herself spent the pandemic in New York, living near Mount Sinai Hospital (“There were sirens day and night and Central Park was turned into a hospital, just as Walt Whitman described during the civil war”). She is a New Yorker by birth, but made her name in Los Angeles, helping to lift the LA Philharmonic into the first division. “We don't have the big five [US orchestras] any more,” she says, “but the big seven.”</p> <p>Initially, she went to LA to open Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Frank Gehry-designed venue that has proved such an icon for the city, but ended up staying 17 years, bringing in the young, livewire Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel as music director, an inspired choice.</p> <p>The difference, she says, is that New York is a truly international city. “There is such easy access from Europe, and only a few hours over the pole from Asia, so there is a larger community of people within reach, and the impact is profound. The New York Philharmonic is a very old orchestra, founded by German firemen who sat around playing Haydn symphonies, and you can always revive a tradition.”</p> <p>Borda will be leaving the New York Philharmonic at a crucial time. The post of music director is due to fall vacant when Jaap van Zweden steps down at the end of the 2023-24 season. Filling vacancies like this from an ever-decreasing pool of prestigious conductors is becoming very tricky. When will the announcement of a successor be made? “Probably not this year” is the cagey reply.</p> <p>As everywhere, there is also the ongoing struggle to attract a young and diverse audience to classical music. Access initiatives are all very well, but is there any barometer to measure whether they actually do any good?</p> <p>“We are beginning to think about that,” says Borda, “because in the past we have quantified success simply through revenue and bodies on seats. One of our big crossover audiences is when the Philharmonic plays [live] for films, and they often turn into Phil attendees later on. If you want to make friends, you don't invite them once. You have to work at it.”</p> <p>As she prepares to step down, Borda is optimistic about the future for music, as long as people have the courage to keep moving ahead. “You have to be allowed to fail,” she says. “If institutions don't fail, it means they haven't been courageous enough. We have been scared enough by what happened [during the pandemic] that a fire has been lit. Through the world's problems — climate change, Ukraine, global hunger — music can be a beacon, if it keeps daring us to try different endeavours, to be who we don't think we are.”</p> <p><em>The New York Philharmonic's 2022-23 season opens at the new David Geffen Hall on October 12, </em><a href=\"https://www.lincolncenter.org/venue/david-geffen-hall\"><em>lincolncenter.org</em></a></p><p>Source: Richard Fairman 2022 'New York Philharmonic's Deborah Borda steps down on a high note' FT.com 12 September.
