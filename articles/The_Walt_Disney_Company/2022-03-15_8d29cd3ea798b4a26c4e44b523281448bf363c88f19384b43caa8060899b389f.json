  "title": "A Year Later, Women's NCAA Tournament Has More Teams, More Sponsors and 'March Madness'; A firestorm spurred by inequities last year spurred a review and an ongoing overhaul of the NCAA's second-largest event",
  "text": "<p>The report by law firm Kaplan Hecker &amp; Fink LLC, released last August, found that the NCAA's \"broadcast agreements, corporate sponsorship contracts, distribution of revenue, organizational structure, and culture all prioritize Division I men's basketball over everything else.\" The findings were significant because the NCAA, a nonprofit organization, is obligated to pursue its stated values such as gender equity in ways professional sports are not.</p><p>A year later, the women's tournament that tips off on Wednesday will be upgraded in a number of ways—many of which were among the Kaplan report's more than two dozen recommendations.</p><p>The field has been expanded by four teams to mirror the men's 68-team bracket. The number of people working on the women's tournament has been increased so that each event now has a staff of 10. Signage for the women's tournament will be boosted, especially in the early rounds, and gifts and other perks for male and female players will be aligned.</p><p>Most visibly, the women's tournament that tips off Wednesday will for the first time feature the popular \"March Madness\" branding that was long used exclusively by the men's tournament. The NCAA earlier had refused to let the women use the slogan even though it owned the right to use it for both tournaments, as The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest organizational change: For the first time in the 40-year history of the women's tournament, men's and women's basketball are working together.</p><p>\"Going back to before Lynn and I got here to the NCAA, the two committees have operated basically independently—supportive of each other, certainly, but not in a collaborative way that it has happened this year,\" said Dan Gavitt, NCAA senior vice president of basketball, in a phone interview with Lynn Holzman, VP for NCAA women's basketball, and The Wall Street Journal. Gavitt added that the men's and women's basketball committees are \"very much connected at the hip now and I think will be in perpetuity.\"</p><p>Going forward, bigger changes are also under consideration—namely, the possibility that the NCAA will sell stand-alone broadcast rights to the women's basketball tournament, which is now bundled with 28 other NCAA championships in a package for which ESPN pays $34 million a year. The NCAA men's basketball broadcast deal with CBS/Turner most recently was extended by eight years for $8.8 billion, and now runs through 2032.</p><p>The NCAA women's basketball tournament has never been put up for competitive bid, and it alone could be worth about $100 million a year after the ESPN deal expires in 2024, a former longtime NBA executive projected in the Kaplan report.</p><p>The number of brands advertising on the 2022 women's tournament broadcast jumped to 15 this year from four last year, said Sean Hanrahan, SVP, Sports Brand Solutions — Disney Advertising.</p><p>ESPN will use virtual \"March Madness\" logos on its broadcasts of first- and second-round women's tournament games, since those on-campus venues won't have the logos on their courts.</p><p>A few of the Kaplan report's biggest recommendations haven't been enacted.</p><p>The NCAA hasn't elevated the VP of women's basketball so the position is equivalent in seniority to the head of men's basketball, as the Kaplan report recommended. Holzman still reports to Gavitt, who oversees all of NCAA basketball.</p><p>Also, the NCAA corporate sponsorship program that the Kaplan report found hindered sports outside men's basketball from cultivating sponsors, is unchanged.</p><p>Under that program, CBS/Turner controls the right to sell sponsorships in all 90 NCAA sports championships. It keeps that revenue, which amounted to more than $200 million last year, according to an estimate by IEG Sponsorship Intelligence Database. Then CBS/Turner pays the NCAA a fixed sum for the sponsorship rights and broadcast rights for the men's basketball tournament. Last year, that fee was $850 million.</p><p>CBS/Turner's pricing for NCAA sponsorships—which runs as high as $35 million a year, according to analysts—and its required ad purchases for men's basketball \"makes it practically impossible\" for a company only interested in women's basketball or another sport to become an official NCAA sponsor, according to the Kaplan report. It recommended allowing the sale of non-conflicting sponsor categories for sports outside men's basketball.</p><p>Representatives of CBS/Turner declined to comment. An NCAA spokeswoman said revenue from the CBS/Turner deal helps support all NCAA sports. She added that re-examination of that contract was among the \"longer-term recommendations\" in the report and that \"we are not speculating on any potential changes at this time.\"</p><p>UCLA women's basketball coach Cori Close called the NCAA's changes to the women's tournament \"really good, needed steps, and they need to be appreciated and acknowledged and celebrated.\"</p><p>But, she added, the NCAA's deals are holding back the potential of the women's tournament, whose TV ratings rose across all rounds last year, capped by the championship audience of 4.1 million, the largest since 2014.</p><p>\"We're not asking to be a charity. We're not asking to be a cause,\" Close said. \"We're asking to treat us as the product we've earned, the asset we've earned credibility in.\"</p><p>Another big idea recommended in the Kaplan report, combining the men's and women's Final Fours on one weekend in the same city, was meant to create one giant event where schools' and NCAA staff, media and sponsors all could gather—rather than splitting up in two different cities, as they do now.</p><p>The NCAA men's and women's basketball committees voted not to pursue a combined Final Four at least through 2031, the round of host-city selections beginning now, Gavitt said. They want to see where the women's tournament's current momentum and the NCAA's recent changes can take it, he said. The women's Final Four has sold out in seven of the past eight years.</p><p>Women's tournament organizers are, however, considering alternative plans such as holding the two Final Fours on different weekends, Holzman said.</p><p>\"They are looking at the totality of what's best for the championship and the health of the championship and where are the areas of growth actually needed,\" she said.</p><p>One thing that won't take center stage this year: weight rooms. Last year's tournaments had unusual setups because they were held entirely in single cities to mitigate Covid spread—Indianapolis for the men, San Antonio for the women—rather than in many different locations, as in a typical year. NCAA championships don't usually have weight rooms.</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>A Year Later, Women's NCAA Tournament Has More Teams, More Sponsors and 'March Madness'</p>",
