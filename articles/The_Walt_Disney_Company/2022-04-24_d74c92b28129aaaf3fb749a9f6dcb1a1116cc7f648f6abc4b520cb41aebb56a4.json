  "title": "Gavin Newsom's Disney Double Talk; The California Governor isn't credible as a critic of Florida policies.",
  "text": "<p>So why are so many companies—Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle, Palantir, Charles Schwab, Toyota, to name a few—moving their headquarters and jobs out of California? And why is California still short 296,000 jobs from pre-pandemic levels while Florida has added 156,000? And why did California lose 261,902 people between 2020 and 2021 while Florida gained 211,196?</p><p>Disney noted a couple reasons last year in announcing the job relocation: Florida's lack of a state income tax and much lower cost-of-living thanks to less heavy-handed government. Consider Mr. Newsom's arbitrary, extended Covid-19 lockdowns. Florida let Disney World reopen in July 2020. Mr. Newsom didn't allow Disneyland do so until late April 2021.</p><p>Former Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned from Mr. Newsom's Potemkin Covid economic task force amid tensions between the state and company over the shutdown. California Democrats are only friendly to businesses they like—e.g., renewable energy and plaintiff law firms.</p><p>Mr. Newsom accuses Florida Republicans of retaliating against Disney after CEO Bob Chapek criticized their bill that limits K-third grade instruction in gender identity or sexual orientation in a manner that is not age-appropriate. No doubt Republicans didn't like Mr. Chapek's public attack on the bill as a \"challenge to basic human rights.\" But as a matter of free-market principles, it's hard to justify Florida's regulatory favoritism for Disney World, as Gov. Ron DeSantis noted.</p><p>As for free speech, Florida isn't saying Disney can't lobby all it wants. And Mr. Newsom is one to talk. The Supreme Court last year struck down a California requirement that private charities fundraising in the state disclose their donors, crediting claims by nonprofits that it could lead to political harassment and reprisal. Recall how progressives targeted donors to the state's 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage.</p><p>One reason CEOs rarely criticize progressive governance is they don't want to become targets of the left. Jennifer Sey has said she was forced to resign as Levi Strauss president after she criticized school closures. The fact that executives feel freer to criticize Republicans than Democrats speaks volumes about who is friendlier to business and free speech.</p><p>Gavin Newsom's Disney Double Talk</p>",
