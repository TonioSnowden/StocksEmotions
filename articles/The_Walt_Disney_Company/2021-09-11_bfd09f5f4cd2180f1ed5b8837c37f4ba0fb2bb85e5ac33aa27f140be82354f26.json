  "text": "<p>   Cruise lines can exert a high degree of control aboard ship, but passengers face a lot of variables in port and on land. Ecuador, for example, requires masks to be worn at all times while visiting the blue-footed boobies on their uninhabited rocks in the Pacific. MSC Cruises sells what the company calls \"Social Bubble Shore Excursions\" to isolate its passengers and protect local environments. (On MSC's first Covid-era cruise in August 2020, a family left the group in Capri and were not allowed back onboard. Other guests cheered.) Before the pandemic, several companies including Disney, MSC and Holland America began buying up private islands in the Caribbean to use for their exclusive shore excursions, which in the Covid age let the lines extend the bubble they can create on board. Otherwise, it's important to know where you're going. \"When going from a largely vaccinated vessel to a general public area,\" said Dr. Wilson, \"there are widely variant virus levels and controls. You're getting off, the crew is getting off, exposure is elevated. Covid-19 has showed us it is a moving target.\" </p><p></p>",
