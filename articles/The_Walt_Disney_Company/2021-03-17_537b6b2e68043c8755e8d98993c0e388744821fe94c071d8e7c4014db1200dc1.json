  "text": "<p>One of the main problems with the Oscars has always been the grinding predictability of the annual awards race, but this season has brought a refreshing change. In an ordinary year, there tends to be an accepted narrative that trundles along, gathering momentum as it goes and dictating which films are award-worthy. With it, the possibility of genuine surprises falls away. But it hardly needs stating that this has been no ordinary year and, as a result, the usual awards narrative has been derailed to some degree.</p> <p>The most obvious beneficiaries have been female directors. Chloé Zhao's nomination for Best Director hardly comes as a surprise, given that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1267f3be-14ee-4dbe-8ae9-30d1f996c901\"><em>Nomadland</em></a>, her gorgeous, elegiac, portrait of life off the grid and on the periphery of US society, has been a deserved frontrunner since it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccb0060e-67fa-465a-917f-4145eede0d1f\">won the Golden Lion</a> at the Venice Film Festival last year. But Emerald Fennell's nomination for Best Director is more unexpected. <em>Promising Young Woman</em> is her feature debut and it's a bracingly divisive picture: prickly and provocative, with a barbed wire and bubblegum aesthetic. It's unlikely to win, but it's exactly the kind of invigorating presence that the stultifyingly conservative Academy Awards needs in order to stay relevant (and, crucially, commercially viable).</p> <p>Perhaps the real surprise should be that it has taken the entire 93-year history of the awards for two women to be nominated for Best Director in the same year. But, given that there have been only five in total previously (Lina Wertmüller, Jane Campion, Sofia Coppola, Kathryn Bigelow and Greta Gerwig), and only one female winner (Bigelow in 2009 for <em>The Hurt Locker</em>), the painfully slow inch towards gender parity is not quite as shocking as it might be.</p> <p>But a look at the list of Best Picture nominees gives other reasons to feel cautiously positive. With <em>Nomadland</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, two female-directed films make the list (joining only 10 others in this category to date). But Fennell is not the only first-time feature director to score a Best Picture nod: Florian Zeller with <em>The Father</em> and Darius Marder with <em>Sound of Metal</em> also make the cut, suggesting a revitalising infusion of new blood.</p> <p>Zeller, already a celebrated playwright and author, is exactly the kind of debut director the Academy would congratulate itself for discovering in the past: Sam Mendes, for example, came from a similar background to win Best Director and Best Picture for his first feature, <em>American Beauty</em>. But Marder's film is a more interesting inclusion. When <em>Sound Of Metal</em>, which stars Riz Ahmed as a heavy metal drummer who suddenly loses his hearing, premiered in Toronto in 2019, this bold, abrasive exploration of disability was widely praised but didn't immediately assert itself in the awards conversation. That it quietly grew into a serious contender is particularly heartening, suggesting a rise powered more by quality than by buzz. It's also worth noting that Ahmed, a deserving contender for Best Actor, is the first Muslim nominee in that category. </p> <p>This year's Oscars selection, described as the “most diverse” to date, builds on the momentum of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d5476b8-4bc0-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\">last year's triumph for Bong Joon Ho's <em>Parasite</em></a>, the first foreign language film to win Best Picture. All of this may be the result of a push by the Academy to promote diversity and inclusion following the shame of activist April Reign's #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2015. A membership drive has doubled the number of active women Academy members and tripled its active members from “under-represented ethnic/racial communities” between 2015 and 2020. They still, however, only account for 33 per cent and 19 per cent of the membership respectively.</p> <p>It's a laudable initiative, but it is not without a degree of self interest. The Academy Awards are entertainment, after all, and like everything else in the increasingly overcrowded entertainment ecosystem, they have to adapt to survive. And any show that has haemorrhaged viewers as emphatically as the Oscars (2020 was a record low of 23.6m, a full 20m fewer than the figure for 2014) needs to stem the tide urgently.</p> <p>The reasons may be complex, but there is no doubt there has been a subtle shift in the idea of what an awards film looks like, particularly compared with the bad old days of Miramax's notoriously aggressive awards campaigns. The sheer criminal awfulness of Harvey Weinstein when it came to his dealings with women has been so well documented that one tends to forget other areas of toxicity, specifically his pernicious influence on the Oscars. Weinstein approached awards season like a WWF wrestler — all muscle, bluster, noise and big, showy gestures. The move to include more female voices might not be a direct attempt by the Academy to distance itself from the worst excesses of the Weinstein era but, then again, it's unlikely to be entirely a coincidence.</p> <p>The typical awards film in those years was a glossy, moneyed prizefighter of a picture that wore its box office returns ostentatiously. But one interesting aspect of the Oscars in the era of Covid-19 is the fact that it has more or less taken the box office out of the equation. In many cases, it has taken the entire audience out of the equation. UK audiences will have to wait until April 30 to see <em>Nomadland</em> (on Disney Plus), and even later for <em>Another Round</em>, from Best Director contender Thomas Vinterberg, and <em>The Father</em>. And without the handy, if distracting, barometer of box office figures, the voters will make their choices based on merit, and merit alone. May the best film win. And this year, like last, it actually might.</p> <p><em>The Academy Awards take place on April 25, </em><a href=\"https://oscars.org/\"><em>oscars.org</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Wendy Ide 2021 'And the winner is . . . a less predictable Oscars night' FT.com 17 March.
