  "text": "<p>Mr. Zaslav's latest leadership shake-up underscores his aggressive approach to restructuring and slimming down the businesses after his Discovery Inc. combined with WarnerMedia, which had been a unit of AT&amp;T Inc., in a merger that was completed in April. His changes have also been aimed at cutting costs across the company including its cable television networks, including CNN, TNT and TBS.</p><p>Mr. Zaslav said in a statement that Mr. De Luca and Ms. Abdy \"are supremely talented creative leaders\" that can \"take this nearly century-old iconic studio to even greater heights of excellence in film.\"</p><p>In a memo to staff Wednesday Mr. Zaslav praised Mr. Emmerich and said he is \"thrilled that he has chosen to remain a part of our Warner Bros. Discovery family through this new production venture.\" Mr. Emmerich will remain in his current role through the summer, Mr. Zaslav said.</p><p>Mr. De Luca and Ms. Abdy -- who most recently ran MGM Motion Picture Group -- will have a smaller role than Mr. Emmerich has had. Mr. Emmerich also oversaw DC Films, the movie arm of Warner Bros.' DC Comics unit.</p><p>Warner Bros. plans to follow a similar strategy as Walt Disney Co., which breaks out its Marvel Studios superhero franchise into a separate business unit with its own creative executives, rather than having it report to another studio head.</p><p>Mr. DeLuca made a splash as a young film executive who championed directors including Paul Thomas Anderson and David Fincher. Mr. DeLuca has played a key role in numerous hit films including \"Boogie Nights\" and \"The Social Network.\" Ms. Abdy has had her fingerprints on successful movies including Mr. Fincher's \"Gone Girl.\"</p>",
