  "text": "<p>\"I was like, OK, we've got to work on this,\" she says.</p><p>Her solution: She found that TV seemed to relax T'Challa. She now flips on court television, such as \"Judge Judy\" or \"The People's Court,\" to babysit her dog when she leaves.</p><p>As pet owners get back at their offices, schools, gyms and social gatherings, they are coming up with creative ways to help their pandemic pups cope. Some have tried pet antianxiety medication. Others are turning to spa treatments or canine \"beer.\"</p><p>PetMeds, an online pet pharmacy, says prescriptions it filled for anxiety medications for pets increased 26% between 2019 and 2021. Mike Petty, a veterinarian in Canton, Mich., says he has prescribed more antianxiety medication in the past year than in the entire past decade.</p><p>Board-certified veterinary behaviorist Lisa Radosta recalls a client who bought a human-size dummy, dressed it in her clothes and sat it on the couch for her dog when she was out of the house.</p><p>\"It was the craziest [solution] that actually worked,\" Dr. Radosta says. \"She sent pictures of the dog lying with its head on the human doll's lap.\"</p><p>At the height of the pandemic, many pets enjoyed almost constant coddling, play time and petting because their owners spent so much time at home. That has come back to bite us, says Dr. Radosta.</p><p>\"Our pets were not getting one nanosecond away from us,\" she says. When their owners began leaving them alone again, she says, \"a lot of anxious animals became way more anxious.\"</p><p>For Togo, a young cavapoo—a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and poodle mix—in Manhattan, the salve was a robotic vacuum. When Togo's owner, Allan Maman, 22, first returned to in-person work meetings, he watched helplessly via a remote security camera as his puppy gazed for hours at the front door.</p><p>He occasionally called Togo's name through the two-way audio function, but the dog just glanced in the camera's direction.</p><p>\"I realized it probably made more sense if there was something moving with him,\" says Mr. Maman. He ordered the Roomba vacuum and watched on the security camera as Togo studied its movements and circled it cautiously.</p><p>\"It's not very practical for actual cleaning,\" says Mr. Maman. \"But for keeping him occupied for 30 minutes to an hour, I would say it's perfect.\"</p><p>In Brazil, which has one of the highest rates of dog ownership in the world, a German Spitz named Pippo went on a hunger strike when his owner, 28-year-old Kelvin Monheit, returned to in-person architecture classes earlier this year. Pippo refused to eat until Mr. Monheit came home at night, started losing his hair and hid under the bed, says Mr. Monheit, who lives in São Paulo.</p><p>Mr. Monheit says he now takes Pippo everywhere he can to cheer him up, including to the shopping mall, restaurants and his favorite cocktail bar, and treats him to dog-friendly chocolate mint cookies.</p><p>Ricardo Chen, 41, the owner of a Brazilian bakery chain for dogs, Padaria Pet, says sales of pet treats have surged as owners try to ease their dogs' loneliness—and their own guilt. Top sellers include biscuits laced with passion fruit essence, which he says is a natural sedative to relieve anxiety. The canine day spa at the company's bakery in downtown São Paulo offers massages and clay masks.</p><p>Veterinarians say true separation anxiety is a condition that should be diagnosed and treated by a professional. For pets displaying less severe anxious behavior, however, creative tactics can be beneficial, they say. Dr. Petty, the veterinarian in Michigan, recalls that during a recent family vacation, he paid a teenage neighbor to watch TV with his own dogs in the evenings.</p><p>For Charlie, a 10-year-old Australian Cattle Dog in Los Angeles who dug trash out of wastebaskets and scratched up closed doors when her owners left the apartment, the solution was a Disney+ subscription. Sabrina Paradas, Charlie's owner, recently started putting out a long-lasting chew treat and turning on \"Frozen\" before leaving the house. The singing by the film's lead animated characters, Anna and Elsa, drowns out any outdoor noises for Charlie to worry about, Ms. Paradas says.</p><p>\"Once she hears that twinkling beginning of 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?',\" Charlie's ears perk up and she jumps onto the couch, says Ms. Paradas. \"She doesn't even look at us as we're leaving anymore.\"</p><p>Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas, who researches how animals interact with technology, developed a device that allowed her Labrador, Zack, to control their communication when she is away from her home in Glasgow.</p><p>The device, which she calls \"DogPhone,\" is a ball programmed to initiate a video call when moved. On a recent night, Dr. Hirskyj-Douglas recalls, Zack called her several times after work.</p><p>\"My phone kept ringing, and I would pick up and say, 'I'll be home later and we'll go on a walk,' and then hang up,\" she says. \"He kept ringing back to the point where I just left the video on, and it was just me watching the dog and the dog watching me.\"</p><p>Write to Alex Janin at Alex.Janin@wsj.com and Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.com</p><p>Return to Office Triggers Anxiety Attacks—for the Dogs Left Alone at Home</p>",
