  "title": "Summer of Soul — the film of 2021 so far, 52 years in the making",
  "text": "<p>You recall that iconic moment in 1969 when a teenage Stevie Wonder, dressed in a ruffled gold shirt, played a thunderous drum solo to 50,000 people on a sunny day in Harlem? No? How about Nina Simone at the same event, slamming her piano keys to begin a smoking “Backlash Blues”? Still nothing? Blanks drawn? The reason why becomes clear in the glorious documentary <em>Summer of Soul</em>. Both these goosebump-inducing scenes feature amid countless more from a catalogue of black music legends. But the movie has a telling subtitle: <em>Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised</em>.</p> <p>The subject is the Harlem Cultural Festival — six weekends of entertainment staged outdoors in New York the same summer that Woodstock unfolded 100 miles north. The film of the latter would be released by 1970, become a box office smash and win an Oscar. Footage from Harlem — shot by the late director Hal Tulchin for a proposed documentary — ended up in his basement. For half a century, the movie never happened. “No interest”, was the industry verdict.</p> <p>Now those dusty tapes have at last been rescued by musician Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson. A full cast list would eat up this whole review. Wonder and Simone are joined by performers including BB King, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Hugh Masekela and Sly and the Family Stone. None is on less than jaw-dropping form. Three further points should be quickly made. One, how much raw sizzle there is to Tulchin's original footage. Two, first-time director Thompson sculpts it like a born film-maker. Three, how gracefully he also nails the heart of the project. We boggle at how this could stay lost so long — with all that implies about cultural priorities. And we keep on dancing as we do. </p> <p>Do you need to love soul to love <em>Summer of Soul</em>? The question may have to be reframed. The music is so irresistible, you might not get a choice. Highlights include a gospel duet between Mavis Staples and Mahalia Jackson, Sly Stone show-stealing with a rasping, electric “Everyday People”. But if the film is a concert movie first and last, that is still only half the story. Expert as onstage curator, Thompson is also skilled at widening the angle.</p> <p>So to the context in full — the killings of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr, Vietnam, the New York trial of the “Panther 21”. On the weekend Stevie Wonder played, Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Harlem vox pops suggest an America busy conquering space might also address the local heroin epidemic. But sheer joy stays in the picture too. Black Power demanded to know what time it was. There was a political answer to that. And yet in a string of sweet modern interviews, festival-goers say this was also when they came of age. They told their parents they were going shopping, then met friends to have their minds blown in a Harlem that for all its troubles was home, and treasured as such.</p> <p><em>Summer of Soul</em> is both historical record and crowd-pleaser. That much is only fitting, given how central the audience are to the kaleidoscopic vibe of the film, a mass counterpoint of dashikis, sombreros and — when necessary — funky rainwear. Between them, the musicians, Tulchin and Thompson, the movie has the rush of a freshly cracked time capsule — one advantage of going 52 years unseen. It is the film of 2021 so far.</p> <p>★★★★★</p> <p><em>In UK cinemas from July 16 and on Star on Disney Plus on from July 30</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Summer of Soul — the film of 2021 so far, 52 years in the making' FT.com 14 July.
