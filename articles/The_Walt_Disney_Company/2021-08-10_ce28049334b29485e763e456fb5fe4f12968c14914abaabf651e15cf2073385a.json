  "text": "<p>For all their drama and pyrotechnics, Hollywood movies rarely boast complex plots. It is the same with cinema chain AMC Entertainment. Some fancy stunts adorn a simple narrative.</p> <p>Chief executive Adam Aron leans hard into the company's status as the ultimate “meme stock”. He is active on Twitter, inviting retail investors to jamborees and promising customers they will soon be able to pay with bitcoin. </p> <p>The theatre chain's future remains dependent on box office receipts. The number itself will not improve much from pre-pandemic levels despite a leap in AMC's market capitalisation to more than $17bn.</p> <p>AMC late on Monday reported second-quarter results. Ticket revenue was about 29 per cent of 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, at the peak of pandemic shutdowns, it was effectively zero. So far in the third quarter, the figure had already jumped more than 40 per cent. </p> <p>AMC's free cash flow deficit in the quarter was $250m. Aron suggested that could flip to positive as soon as the fourth quarter. The inflection would likely require a 2021 domestic box office total of $5bn. In 2019, the domestic box office exceeded $11bn, a figure out of reach for perhaps two or three years.</p> <p>AMC's stock price at the end of 2019 was about $7. Now it is more than $30, even with a share count five times higher. The cinema business is also in a much more precarious spot. Studios such as Disney and Warner Brothers are increasingly content to release movies directly to their streaming services, spurning the traditional “window” for theatrical viewings. </p> <p>This existential threat has barely mattered much to the Robinhood meme stock crowd. They have sent AMC shares as high as $62 this year. </p> <p>Aron smartly used the mania to sell more than $1bn of equity in the quarter. But AMC also has a towering debt and lease load exceeding $10bn. Popcorn and soda sales remain strong and AMC is grabbing market share. But the simple maths of a mature to declining market remains immutable.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'AMC: cinematic plot holes imperil the meme dream' FT.com 10 August.
