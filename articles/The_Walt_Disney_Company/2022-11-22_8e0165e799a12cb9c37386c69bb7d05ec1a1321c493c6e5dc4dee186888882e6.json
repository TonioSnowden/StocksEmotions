  "text": "<p>Senior Walt Disney executives <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9277a18-18f6-42ea-a1fb-7e762120846a\">led a rebellion against chief executive Bob Chapek</a> in recent weeks, which resulted in his ousting and replacement with predecessor Bob Iger, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The covert campaign to overthrow Chapek, which began in the summer, came after the outgoing chief executive lost the confidence of some members of his top team during a tumultuous 33 months at the helm of the media empire.</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“A lot of people were approaching the board, Iger loyalists who felt marginalised” — One person with knowledge of the talks</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Shares in Walt Disney rallied 6.3 per cent yesterday as investors wagered that Iger, one of America's most celebrated media executives, could lift morale and boost returns at the company's costly streaming unit. By yesterday afternoon, Iger had dismissed Kareem Daniel, a trusted Chapek ally who ran the group's streaming strategy.</p> <p>Disney executives began approaching the board, which is chaired by Susan Arnold, a few months ago to express concerns about Chapek's leadership. Christine McCarthy, chief financial officer, was among the executives who complained, three of the people said. Disney declined to comment.</p> <p>The final straw was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c82e33b-6b33-45ea-8bfd-9387dedb8736\">Disney's earnings release</a> on November 8, during which Chapek reported the company's streaming business had lost $1.5bn during the most recent quarter. Three days later, Chapek announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03c67fd5-5d31-45fb-8863-a33ff77d2bb8\">job cuts</a>.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. OECD says world economy ‘reeling</strong>' <strong>from energy shock</strong> New OECD forecasts showed growth in almost every major economy was set to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6b84faf-f556-4fdd-ac27-65c2d514aa2f\">weaker next year</a> than it thought in June, as persistently high inflation slashes people's spending power. The UK will be the worst performing G20 economy after Russia.</p> <p><strong>2. FTX management tracks down $1.24bn in cash holdings </strong>FTX's new management team has located more cash belonging to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecafba91-abb7-4445-836c-b3be910e85bd\">bankrupt crypto conglomerate</a>, bringing the tally to $1.24bn, as consultants rush to identify the company's assets ahead of a US court hearing later on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>3. China lockdowns reach record level</strong> Covid-19 cases in China are spiralling towards record highs, forcing officials to again lock down large swaths of the country. There were nearly 28,000 new cases on Tuesday, with outbreaks in the Chinese capital, the southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou and the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing continuing to grow.</p> <p><strong>4. Carmakers try to frustrate US push to cut China from EV supply chain</strong> <br>The world's largest carmakers are trying to water down a Biden administration effort to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bcb1c6b-61aa-4ec7-80ac-2c455fbc8099\">replace Chinese components</a> with US ones in electric vehicle manufacturing, as the industry grapples with dependence on battery materials processed overseas.</p> <p><strong>5. World Cup gets under way </strong>Team USA's first match in Qatar ended in a 1-1 draw against Wales. A bid by the Netherlands, England and Wales to promote inclusion <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fcfb720-c503-4dd5-ab52-88411edf6910\">collapsed</a> after threats from Fifa. The teams had planned to wear rainbow-coloured armbands to oppose discrimination as homosexuality is illegal in Qatar.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>More football news:</strong> England began their campaign with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab9351d3-65d2-4d46-8a01-94abe590d85e\">thumping 6-2 victory</a> over Iran, while the Netherlands beat Senegal 2-0. Argentina and France enter the fray today. Read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d143da13-72fc-4865-93de-43e27a3ad809\">our daily debrief here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Trump lawsuit </strong>State prosecutors and former US president Donald Trump's legal team gather for a preliminary conference in New York attorney-general Letitia James's $250mn lawsuit against Trump and his children for fraud. The case pertains to alleged inflation of the value of the Trump Organisation's assets. </p> <p><strong>Earnings </strong>Reports from electronics chain Best Buy, personal computer maker HP, discount store Dollar Tree, athletic retailer Dick's Sporting Goods and department store Nordstrom will give some insight into consumer spending patterns and the outlook for the holiday season ahead of Black Friday. </p> <p><strong>Fedspeak </strong>Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester will give opening remarks at her branch's Conversations on Central Banking series, which today will focus on wages and inflation.</p> <p><strong>Canadian retail sales: </strong>Retail sales in Canada are anticipated to have declined by half a percentage point from August to September, with an extra 0.1 per cent decline once automobiles are stripped out.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Growing list of books targeted in US culture wars </strong>The US looks set to withdraw a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d9ce954-ed2e-4c15-81d8-91a5b2a88905\">record number of books</a> from schools and libraries this year as America's culture wars place growing pressure on children, educators and publishers. Fresh estimates from the American Library Association and PEN America, which campaigns for literary freedom, show a surge in efforts by parents, advocacy groups and politicians to withdraw publications they claim are inappropriate for younger readers.</p> <p><strong>There's a deepening mental health recession </strong>Employee assistance programmes face a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5dc1d64-1f7b-4776-89fa-cad55e4f87d2\">swelling wave of complex mental health problems</a> brought to them by people with nowhere else to turn. What's behind the increase? Sarah O'Connor explores.</p> <p><strong>Latin America's leaders face daunting odds </strong>Lula's election in Brazil marked the 15th victory in a row by an opposition party in the region, but Latin America editor Michael Stott says this is more to do with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8361b0ed-e754-4fe6-b519-0527faf1417f\">frustration over sitting governments</a> rather than positive endorsements or a “pink tide” of leftwing support.</p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia's green agenda </strong>The world's top crude exporter has for decades happily burnt billions of barrels of oil to fuel power plants, desalination units and industries at heavily subsidised rates. Now, investment in solar and wind might <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fba03c9-9326-4d7c-bd0c-74fdf2b2ebf8\">help the kingdom meet emissions targets</a> — and pump more crude to sell.</p> <p><strong>US vice-president visits Philippine island off contested South China Sea </strong><br>Kamala Harris visited the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5c3d97e-b9f4-4ce2-ab7c-5a11b10b9f94\">Philippine island of Palawan</a> on the edge of the disputed South China Sea today, in a bold demonstration of how Washington and Manila are reinvigorating their security alliance as they guard against an increasingly assertive Beijing.</p> <h1>Food and drink</h1> <p>Why tequila is finally being taken seriously, bigging up the Christmas buffet and putting on the perfect party: It's the FT festive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30e61984-e01a-4c8c-9a08-769f4153d611\">food and drink special</a>.</p><p>Source: Jennifer Creery, Emily Goldberg and Yasemin Craggs Mersinoglu 2022 'FirstFT: Bob Chapek's rocky final days at Disney' FT.com 22 November.
