  "text": "<p>Should the 2021 Oscars go where they are expected, it will be declared a happy ending. A Best Picture and Director double for frontier drama <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1267f3be-14ee-4dbe-8ae9-30d1f996c901\"><em>Nomadland</em></a> and its creator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb3921e-6335-4a50-bcd2-4bbf5ad6e091\">Chloé Zhao</a> — a result on which you can now only get miserly odds — will make Zhao the first non-western woman director to win either prize. For the Academy Awards, so often a social media piñata, that much will be a cause of relief. Glitter and progress: such is the Oscars' feel-good story.</p> <p>But feel-good stories can be complex up close. If Zhao does triumph this Sunday, Disney executives will also have cause to celebrate. Because <em>Nomadland</em> — strange as it seems given its art house tang — is a Disney film, acquired as part of the company's 2019 takeover of 21st Century Fox. The studio, too, has evolved rapidly in recent times. But to its board and shareholders, victory this weekend will not mark a new start as much as an old habit restored.</p> <p>Oscar trivia may tell you that Disney has never won Best Picture. In fact, it did so four times from 1997 on, all achieved through Miramax, its wholly owned “indie” subsidiary, led by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7ad92af-d0ca-447b-a84a-d076984138f1\">Harvey Weinstein</a>. The final Miramax Best Picture winner was <em>No Country For Old Men</em> in 2008 — the last Oscars before the financial crash. By then Weinstein had already left the company. After a long downsizing, Miramax was sold to a Qatari/US investment group in 2010.</p> <p>In the years since the crash, change has dizzied both the industry and the awards: the rollback of studio power, the rise of streaming, the jailing of Weinstein, the centrality of diversity. History may record milestones in the latter as a smooth and simple timeline. In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director with <em>The Hurt Locker</em>; three years later, Steve McQueen the first black film-maker to direct a Best Picture (<em>12 Years a Slave</em>); Barry Jenkins the first to do so with an all-black cast in 2017 (<em>Moonlight</em>); in 2020, the first Best Picture not made in the English language (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d5476b8-4bc0-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\"><em>Parasite</em></a>). The reality has been spikes of controversy between each landmark.</p> <p>The Academy would like to claim the striking diversity of this year's nominees as a watershed. Perhaps. It may also be that the 2021 Oscars mostly exists as a stark reminder of the limits of progress — the gulf between award shows and the wider world.</p> <p>For the Oscars, the pandemic has posed questions of logistics. Beyond, there have been harder, sadder challenges. This year's breakthrough by Zhao as the Chinese maker of a much-admired American movie will come as ordinary Asian-Americans deal with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55160d62-5e2b-4eee-9851-c894dc660eae\">wave of abuse and violence</a>, assumed to be the product of rhetoric around Covid-19. Fourteen months ago, <em>Parasite</em> was hailed as a triumph for art over nationalism. Now its South Korean director, Bong Joon-ho, has been moved to call the rise in US anti-Asian hate crime “fearful”. Similarly, the night four years ago that <em>Moonlight</em> won Best Picture feels a long time ago in the week former Minneapolis police officer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e54b78d-6988-4937-9c93-b9ecfe735a50\">Derek Chauvin was convicted</a> of murdering George Floyd.</p> <p>Still, change at the Oscars has at least retuned the film industry. Young talents who saw McQueen or Bigelow prevail and glimpsed a place for themselves in the movies will now be building careers. The business in which they are finding space now has an expanded sense of who can create a successful movie. This much is not small print.</p> <p>But if the people making films have changed, what of those who make the profits? Parallel to the story of the directors who win Best Picture is that of the companies backing them — a narrative with an arc of its own.</p> <p>The dominance of old Hollywood was giving way even before 2008. Columbia, still the studio with the most historic Best Picture wins to its name, was acquired by Sony in 1989. It never won again. Paramount, in second place, last had a Best Picture in 1998. But the crash transformed the landscape still further, traditional studios now seeing the kind of films aimed at the Oscars — prone to failure, reliant on critics — as a risk and distraction. They were still greenlit; just not often.</p> <p>Among those to change tack most dramatically was Disney. In 2009, the company prepared to sell Miramax. The same year it paid $4bn to buy Marvel Entertainment, the comic book empire that would supply <em>The Avengers</em>, among other giant franchises.</p> <p>With the studios engaged elsewhere, upstarts gatecrashed the Oscars. Not coincidentally, they brought new voices with them. In 2010, when Bigelow was garlanded for <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, the film had been released by the independent Summit Entertainment. In the decade to come, major studios were only the most sporadic Best Picture winners. Only Fox Searchlight — the boutique division set up by its parent company in 1994 — kept pace with quick feet from outside the studio system. Three of the past five awards have gone to independents: Open Road (<em>Spotlight</em>), A24 (<em>Moonlight</em>) and Neon (<em>Parasite</em>).</p> <p>Financially, the modest box office bump that even a Best Picture generated made it easy for the studios to stop worrying about Oscars. And yet movies are irrational. Prestige alone can be an enduring currency.</p> <p>Little illustrates that better than the now annual efforts of Netflix to win Best Picture. This year, it has funded lavish award campaigns for two nominees, Aaron Sorkin's <em>The Trial of the Chicago 7</em> and David Fincher's <em>Mank</em>. Nothing in the limited data released by Netflix suggests either has rivalled <em>Money Heist</em> for viewers — or that an Oscar win would inspire a subscriber boom, the service having just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52705cd6-eb44-4845-9337-1126219f102c\">reported a notable slowdown</a> in those. But, seen in a particular light, a Best Picture win is that most precious of status symbols — the one with no apparent price tag.</p> <p>That also appeared to be the logic of the one studio operation to remain a regular frontrunner in Oscar races after 2008. Fox Searchlight had been established to compete with Disney's Miramax. It had to wait a long time for success. In 2009 — the first year after Miramax left the stage — the company finally won Best Picture with <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>. In Oscar terms, it began a wildly successful era. Between 2009 and 2019, the company would release 13 Best Picture nominees. Among them were four winners. (After <em>Slumdog</em> came <em>12 Years a Slave</em>, <em>Birdman</em> and <em>The Shape of Water</em>.)</p> <p>The fifth could well have been <em>Nomadland</em>. Zhao's film was bought by Fox Searchlight in February 2019. A month later, the headline sale to Disney found her low-budget movie swept up in a vast agglomeration of Fox content: the <em>X-Men</em> franchise, <em>Titanic</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, 50 per cent of TV company Endemol Shine — makers of <em>Big Brother</em> — and much, much else. Disney had put the finishing touches to a future mapped while Fox was winning Oscars: reinvention as a one-stop shop of screen entertainment, the streaming service Disney Plus built to conquer the new age.</p> <p>As such, what is unknown beyond the company's Burbank headquarters is how much the Disney of 2021 even cares about an Oscar. Did the company only end up back in the awards business by accident, this year's Best Picture a mere footnote in the creation of a content library? Wait and see for the answer to that. Searchlight (de-Foxed) is now a Disney subdivision. Time will tell how many films it releases and what support it gets.</p> <p>For now, an old truth has reasserted itself. All manner of things have changed for the Oscars and the film industry since 2008. Yet they have also circled back to exactly where they were — to the biggest prizes in movies going to Disney. And Chloé Zhao? She was en route to Burbank anyway. Her next film will be <em>Eternals</em> — a $200m Marvel blockbuster designed to launch a whole new superhero franchise. An Oscar for <em>Nomadland</em> would be nice for its makers, you suspect. To Zhao and Disney alike, the real business has always been down the road.</p> <p><em>The 93rd Academy Awards take place on April 25, </em><a href=\"https://www.oscars.org/\"><em>oscars.org</em></a></p> <p><em>Data visualisation by </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/chris-campbell\"><em>Chris Campbell</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Nomadland, Disney and the drive for Oscars dominance in 2021' FT.com 23 April.
