  "text": "<p>\n  TARGET CORP. </p><p>\n  TGT +0.5% </p><p>\n  Black Friday is starting well before Black Friday. Retail giants Target and Walmart Inc. are kicking off their Black Friday sales this month in a bid to draw customers and compete with Amazon.com Inc., as they did in 2021. Unlike last year, retailers are overwhelmed with excess inventory as shoppers' spending habits shift. Target in June said with consumer spending slowing, it would need to offer discounts to get rid of unwanted goods. The moves come as Amazon offered another Prime Day-like event on Oct. 11 and 12. Target shares increased 0.5% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WALT DISNEY CO. </p><p>\n  DIS -2.2% </p><p>\n  Skipping the lines at Disney just got more expensive. The entertainment giant raised the pricing for its Genie+ service, which allows visitors to Disney World and Disneyland to bypass popular rides' lengthy standby waits. Now, the service's cost will vary day to day, based on how crowded the parks are. At Walt Disney World, Genie+ will cost between $15 and $22, depending on the popularity of a given day, during the month of October. That pricing is subject to change beyond this month and could be higher at peak times like winter holidays. Disney shares lost 2.2% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO. </p><p>\n  JPM +1.7% </p><p>\n  Wall Street is building up defenses for a potential recession. JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter earnings dropped 17% as it set aside an additional $808 million for potential loan losses. The results follow Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's warning Monday that a U.S. recession is likely in the next six to nine months. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. added $385 million to reserves, and Citigroup Inc. set aside $370 million. JPMorgan shares climbed 1.7% Friday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  META PLATFORMS INC. </p><p>\n  META -3.9% </p><p>\n  Meta, the parent of Facebook, is taking aim at the PC business. The company stated its ambition to go after the professional computing market on Tuesday with the announcement of its Quest Pro advanced virtual reality headset. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the new device, which costs around $1,500, could be a way for workers to supplement or replace their use of PCs. Meta also announced partnerships with Microsoft Corp. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. that are expected to make the VR headsets more useful in hybrid-work scenarios. Meta shares fell 3.9% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE INC. </p><p>\n  WBA +5.4% </p><p>\n  Walgreens' pharmacy business is under the weather. The nation's second-biggest drugstore chain posted a drop in quarterly revenue as it filled fewer prescriptions and gave fewer Covid shots. Sales were hampered by a shortage of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, as hundreds of stores operate with reduced hours because they lack enough workers. Walgreens said it's counting on its healthcare business to fuel growth; its new healthcare unit includes the primary-care provider VillageMD and home-health benefits manager CareCentrix. Walgreens shares rose 5.4% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  DOMINO'S PIZZA INC. </p><p>\n  DPZ +10% </p><p>\n  A stronger dollar and staff shortages haven't knocked down Domino's. The pizza chain reported higher income as U.S. sales were boosted by price increases, offsetting a decline from international outlets due to weakening foreign currencies against the dollar. Domino's has changed its longtime promotion that offered two value items for $5.99 to now include an extra dollar per item if the order is delivered rather than picked up at stores. The company struggled with staffing shortages this year -- particularly among delivery drivers. Domino's shares gained 10% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  ALBERTSONS COS. </p><p>\n  ACI -8.3% </p><p>\n  Kroger Co. is ready at the checkout line with a new purchase: Albertsons. The two supermarket chains said Friday that Kroger will acquire its smaller rival in a $24.6 billion deal -- one of the biggest in the history of the U.S. grocery industry. The tie-up would create a new supermarket powerhouse with thousands of stores and give the companies greater scale to compete against Walmart Inc. and other big retailers. The deal is likely to face regulatory scrutiny at a time when food prices for shoppers have soared. Albertsons shares declined 8.3% Friday. </p><p></p>",
