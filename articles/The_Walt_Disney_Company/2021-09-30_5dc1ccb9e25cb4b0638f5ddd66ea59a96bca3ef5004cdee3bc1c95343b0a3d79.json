  "title": "Osinachi to offer first African artist's NFT at Christie's Europe",
  "text": "<p>Osinachi — a Nigerian digital artist who has also created his own cryptocurrency called Osina — will be the first African artist to auction non-fungible tokens through Christie's Europe and in collaboration with the 1-54 African art fair. Five of Osinachi's works, which reimagine a 1972 swimming pool painting by David Hockney, are estimated between £40,000 and £60,000 each in an online-only sale (October 5-19). </p> <p>The works — which can also be bought with ether or bitcoin — primarily address work-life imbalances but also have a black protagonist, something that is “very significant to his highly personal work”, says Isabel Millar, a Christie's specialist.</p> <p>The 29-year-old Osinachi, whose full name is Prince Jacon Osinachi Igwe, creates detailed digital works using Microsoft Office, an unusually basic application in a high-tech field. Earlier this year, he sold three NFTs for the equivalent of $75,000 in just 10 days. “NFTs have given him a great platform and such visibility,” Millar says. Christie's will show the works on screens at this year's <a href=\"https://www.1-54.com/london/\">1-54</a> London fair (October 14-17). </p>  <p><strong>Specialists at the rare book dealer</strong> Peter Harrington have pulled together an in-depth collection for <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/fairs/frieze-masters\">Frieze Masters</a> that shows how climate change is not just a contemporary concern. The 800-plus items span a 1485 printed book on weather forecasting to the Nasa-stamped, first colour photograph of Earth taken during the Apollo 8 lunar orbit (“Earthrise”, 1968). </p> <p>Also included is the first article to apply the “greenhouse” metaphor to global warming — published in 1899 by Swedish scientist Nils Gustaf Ekholm — and an engraved 1848 portrait of Alexander von Humboldt, an early observer of human impact on the environment. A 2002 print by Banksy, showing characters from Disney's <em>The Jungle Book</em> in a razed forest and made for Greenpeace, is also in the collection — this is on view in the London gallery as it was made after the Frieze Masters cut-off date. </p> <p>The collection is priced at £1.65m, with 10 per cent of proceeds going to the World Land Trust charity, confirms gallery owner Pom Harrington. “It is a very visual, comprehensive and high-quality history of climate change. It could go straight into any museum,” he says. <a href=\"https://www.onehundredsecondstomidnight.co.uk/\"><em>onehundredsecondstomidnight.co.uk</em></a></p> <p>At the coinciding <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/fairs/frieze-london\">Frieze London</a> fair, organisers have given a booth to the Gallery Climate Coalition, an organisation launched in October 2020 that now boasts 556 members. As well as being on hand to answer exhibitor and visitor questions, the GCC has a single-edition photo donated by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18398928-86c2-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> and his gallerist Maureen Paley. “Lignin duress (d)” (2014) is priced at $95,000 and offered at the fair to support the GCC.</p>  <p><strong>Mark Fehrs Haukohl, a Houston-based</strong> investment banker and art collector, has given 200 photographs by 90 European female artists jointly to New York's Brooklyn Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Contemporary artists in the collection include Yto Barrada, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d07a0994-6e35-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\">Hannah Starkey</a> and Sarah Pickering. The institutions are not putting a value on Haukohl's gift but note it also includes a research and travel grant for a curator to visit art fairs and biennials in Europe to expand their respective collections in the area. This opportunity is “even more exciting” than the works, says Michael Govan, director of Lacma.</p> <p>It is the first time the two institutions have joined forces on an acquisition of this size. Anne Pasternak, director of the Brooklyn Museum, says it is a sign of new models to come following the “stark financial realities exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic”. </p> <p>The first show from the collection will focus on work made since 2000 and opens at Lacma on November 14. <em>In the Now: Gender and Nation in Europe</em> then travels to the Brooklyn Museum in 2023.</p>  <p><strong>Stalwart Los Angeles gallerist</strong> David Kordansky has confirmed rumours that he is expanding his operation for the first time to New York. In April 2022, he is due to open a ground-floor space on Chelsea's West 20th Street, where neighbours include Jack Shainman Gallery and David Zwirner. “There is a profound electricity to New York,” Kordansky says. The gallery has hired Anna Fisher, previously director of sales at Victoria Miro gallery, who starts as Kordansky's New York director next week. </p> <p>Kordansky says the move was prompted partly by his artists, whom he feels deserve a showing in the world's biggest art market centre — he cites the institutionally acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad43ee34-a1d4-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2\">Andrea Büttner</a> — and by his clients in and around the Big Apple. “They have been asking us for years when we are going to move to the next phase. It's time,” Kordansky says. </p> <p>He will bring a bit of LA to NY from the outset — the opening show is of Lauren Halsey, whom he describes as “one of the most important LA artists in her generation”.</p>  <p><strong>There is a renewed enthusiasm</strong> for England's liberally minded Bloomsbury Group artists, including Roger Fry, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. London dealership Philip Mould recently opened a show dedicated to the magnetism of Charleston, a farmhouse in Sussex to where Bell, Grant and their various loved ones decamped during the first world war (<a href=\"https://philipmould.com/exhibitions/28-charleston-the-bloomsbury-muse/\"><em>Charleston: The Bloomsbury Muse</em></a>, until November 10). A coinciding exhibition in <a href=\"https://www.charleston.org.uk/exhibition/duncan-grant-1920/\">Charleston</a> itself shows Grant's avant-garde works, many of which appeared at the artist's first London show in 1920 (until March 13, 2022). </p> <p>“Their unusual love triangles and philosophies have helped ensure that an almost mythical intrigue surrounds the Bloomsbury Group and there have been a number of new collectors over the past 12 to 18 months,” says Brett Tryner, director of the Cambridge auction house Cheffins. </p> <p>He notes recent records for Fry, whose portrait of the writer EM Forster (c1911-20), estimated between £30,000 and £50,000, sold for £325,062 last year (Bonhams), and for Bell, whose “Autumn Bouquet” (1912) sold for £256,250 in March (est £25,000-£35,000, Christie's). </p> <p>On October 28, Cheffins offers Fry's “Mountains in Venice” painting (1926, est £6,000-£8,000) and two nude studies by Grant (est £600-£800, framed together). The latter once belonged to Angelica Garnett, Bell and Grant's illegitimate daughter, who was born in Charleston in 1918 and died in 2012.</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Melanie Gerlis 2021 'Osinachi to offer first African artist's NFT at Christie's Europe' FT.com 30 September.
