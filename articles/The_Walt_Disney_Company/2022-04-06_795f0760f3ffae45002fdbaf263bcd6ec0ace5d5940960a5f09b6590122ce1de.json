WDW News Today, a repository of all manner of stories about Disney, reports that Mandalorian hand sanitizer, which has a picture of Baby Yoda from the hit show, wasn't safe for human little ones.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration says the now-removed product contained benzene. That chemical, which can be absorbed through the skin, could cause life-threatening cancers and blood disorders, the FDA said.</p><p>The same outside manufacturer, Best Brands Consumer Products Inc., made Mickey Mouse brand hand sanitizer. It was recalled by the FDA because it contained methanol, which the agency noted can cause nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, blindness or damage to the central nervous system.</p><p>And all that can happen before riding \"It's a Small World.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
