The index is down around 13% from its record close in November, meeting the definition of a market correction.</p><p>Much discussion around the recent bout of weakness in equities has been centered on the rise in yields and the prospect for higher benchmark rates. Markets have been dogged by a bond market selloff and fears of Federal Reserve tightening to combat surging inflation, and that has particularly hit rate-sensitive technology stocks.</p><p>Both Wednesday and Thursday saw indexes log gains early in the day only to surrender them later, rattling investors.</p><p>However, a bumpy start to earnings season also has dented investor confidence, with a string of downbeat bank results, and gloom about Netflix NFLX, after the streaming service reported far weaker than expected subscriber growth numbers.</p><p>“Thus far in January, upward earnings revisions tumbled to 58.6% from 71.8% in December and 70.7% in November, versus a peak of 82.3% in August,” analysts at Citigroup wrote.</p><p>“Peaking of revision momentum could be a catalyst for market weakness,” the Citi analysts wrote.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;Netflix admits that it is time to grow up, but Wall Street isn't happy about it</p><p>And:‘We see few catalysts.'
