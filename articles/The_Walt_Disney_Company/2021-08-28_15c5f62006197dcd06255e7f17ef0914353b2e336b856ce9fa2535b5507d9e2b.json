  "text": "<p>When Arts &amp; Entertainment had its debut as a cable television service in 1984, it wasn't obvious that large numbers of people would pay for a steady diet of ballet, symphonies and recycled BBC programs.</p><p>Nickolas Davatzes, A&amp;E's first chief executive officer, who died Aug. 21 at the age of 79, was so unsure of the channel's survival prospects that he didn't bother at first to decorate his office with the usual family photos. \"After 60 days here, I told my wife I didn't think this thing had a 20% chance,\" Mr. Davatzes told the New York Times later.</p><p>Yet Mr. Davatzes succeeded in creating durable brands for what started out as a hodgepodge. Programs in the 1980s included a biography of Herbert Hoover, a performance by the stand-up comic Buzz Belmondo and a salute to the 200th anniversary of Australia's birth.</p><p>The network discovered that military topics drew more male viewers and that documentariesabout history and famous people were popular. Those led to offshoots, including the History Channel, which originally offered black-and-white footage of World War II sea battles or early jazz musicians before branching into racier fare, such as a series on the history of sex.</p><p>In November 2003, a History Channel program, \"The Guilty Men,\" alleged that Lyndon Baines Johnson was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Johnson family and others protested furiously. Several months later, the History Channel apologized to the Johnson family and agreed to air a follow-up program challenging the assertions made in the original show.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes sometimes bounced a basketball as he made the rounds of the head office. It was his way of breaking the ice for casual chats with his staff.</p><p>The company, now known as A+E Networks, is a joint venture of Hearst Communications Inc. and Walt Disney Co. A+E Networks says its programs reach more than 335 million households globally in 41 languages.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes, who retired in 2005, got his start in the early days of cable television and stayed in the field long enough to see it transformed by digital technology and the internet. \"It's like rolling the dice right now,\" he said about changes in the industry in 1998. \"I said to myself, 'I'm not sure where this ship is going, but I'm getting on it.' I don't want to be in a position of finding out they discovered America and I'm not there because I'm still in Greece tending my sheep.\"</p><p>That may have been an oblique reference to his father, George Davatzes, who was born in Greece, emigrated to the U.S. as a young man and was co-owner of a shop in Manhattan making fur coats. His mother, Alexandra Kordes Davatzes, also of Greek descent, helped out at the fur shop.</p><p>The older of two children, Nick Davatzes was born March 14, 1942. As a teenager, he learned to nail animal skins to coat patterns at his father's shop.</p><p>At St. John's University in Queens, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's in sociology. He volunteered to serve in the Marines and was stationed in the U.S. In 1968, he married Dorothea Hayes, a schoolteacher whom he had met at St. John's.</p><p>He found a job selling copiers for Xerox Corp. \"I had a great reason for going to Xerox,\" he said. \"I was tired of being poor.\" He later became an executive in Xerox's Learning Systems business, which offered training programs. After a brief spell at another company that provided information services and educational materials, he joined Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc., where he was a personnel executive and later managed cable operating companies.</p><p>When Warner tried to transfer him to Houston, Mr. Davatzes resisted. \"My wife and I had decided early on that we were not going to move our children around, no matter what that meant for my career,\" he said. Instead, he stayed in the New York area and joined A&amp;E -- created from the merger of two struggling channels -- as chief executive in December 1983 to prepare for its launch.</p><p>Mr. Davatzes died at his home in Wilton, Conn. He had been under treatment for Parkinson's disease. He is survived by his wife, Dorothea Hayes Davatzes, two sons, four grandchildren and a sister. Another son, Christopher, died of leukemia in 1974.</p><p>President George W. Bush presented Mr. Davatzes with the National Humanities Medal in 2006.</p>",
