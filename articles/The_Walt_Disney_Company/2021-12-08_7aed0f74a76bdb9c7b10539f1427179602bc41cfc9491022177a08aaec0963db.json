  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Adapted by Disney, Rococo Was Not for Kids",
  "text": "<p>   The art of the Rococo was not merely supposed to be fun (\"Icons: Disney Knows Rococo,\" Review, Nov. 27); it is frequently suggestive, intended for the private delectation of adult viewers. Jean-Honore Fragonard's painting \"The Swing,\" illustrated in the article as inspiration for scenes in Disney movies, was commissioned by a patron who requested the artist to depict him looking up his mistress's frothy pink dress, as she was pushed on the swing by an elderly bishop. </p><p>   Fragonard was happy to oblige: He shows the patron reclining in the corner, his arm outstretched toward the object of his affection. Above him a grisaille putto holds his fingers to his lips, indicating the secret nature of the encounter. The young woman kicks off her silken mule slipper, a motif for sexual freedom. </p><p>   My students are always surprised to learn the true meaning of the painting, as they recognize it from versions that appear in the Disney films \"Frozen\" and \"Tangled\" (minus the ogling patron, of course). It is fascinating to see the original work's theme of love and desire transformed into one expressing the carefree innocence of childhood. </p><p>    Asst.
