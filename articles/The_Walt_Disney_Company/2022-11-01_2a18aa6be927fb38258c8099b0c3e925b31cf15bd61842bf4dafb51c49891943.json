  "title": "Fox Logs Higher Revenue as Political Ads Rolled In; Media company reports 8% growth in advertising revenue in latest quarter",
  "text": "<p>On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.21 a share, topping analyst expectations of $1.14 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue was $3.19 billion for the quarter, up from $3.05 billion last year and above Wall Street analyst expectations of $3.17 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>The top-line growth was driven by an 8% jump in advertising revenue thanks to higher political advertising sales at Fox's television studio and higher prices across its news and sports brands, along continued growth at its ad-supported streaming service Tubi. The gain was partially offset by lower ratings at Fox Network, the company said.</p><p>Fox Corp. and News Corp, the parent of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, share common ownership.</p><p>The earnings report comes as Fox owner Rupert Murdoch considers a recombination of the company with News Corp, the two pillars of his media empire that were split nearly a decade ago. The version of Fox that split off from News Corp in 2013 is slimmer than the company as it stands today following the sale of its major entertainment properties to Walt Disney Co. in 2019.</p><p>Fox has formed a special committee to examine the transaction. The company added Tuesday that it hasn't made any decision yet and that there is no guarantee that it will engage in such a transaction.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Fox Logs Higher Revenue as Political Ads Rolled In</p>",
