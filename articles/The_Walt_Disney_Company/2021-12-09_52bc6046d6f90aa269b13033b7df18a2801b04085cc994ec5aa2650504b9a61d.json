  "title": "'Red Rocket' Review: A Manchild's Adult Entertainment; Sean Baker's latest tells the story of a washed-up porn star with tawdry dreams of glory",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Baker's films stand apart from everyone else's, and hooray for them: I still remember with pleasure the flow of gleeful kids—poor kids living in shabby motels within sight of Walt Disney World—through his previous feature, \"The Florida Project.\" He makes smart, funny, unsentimental and nonjudgmental movies about all manner of poor people on the margins of society, and gives them so much eccentric verve that we sit in nonjudgment too.</p><p>The plot of \"Red Rocket,\" which he wrote with Chris Bergoch, serves as a fragile container for a force of unnature who may be diminished but is ultimately uncontainable. Mikey shows up uninvited and out of nowhere at the scruffy Gulf Coast house where his estranged wife and occasional hooker, Lexi (Bree Elrod), lives with her slatternly mother, Lil (Brenda Deiss). He seems to be an innocent, and self-styled victim, at the end of his rope. Not for long, though. Soon he's bopping between Lexi and an underage counter clerk at a local doughnut shop—more about her in a moment—and enlisting other seeming innocents in his resurgent dreams of fame and wealth.</p><p>Since Mikey is woefully damaged goods, and approximately as wise as Lexi's sad-eyed, flop-eared pooch, it's fair to wonder why we should care about him. Because, first and foremost, he's a wonderfully energetic example of a state of mind—and of body—that isn't confined to delusional losers trying to pass themselves off as Hollywood stars. (He also tells anyone who will listen that he has made 2,000 films.) A total stranger to himself, he lives in the moment—another trait he shares with Lexi's pooch—creating new and fleeting selfs for whatever each moment requires. That means he can be affable, supportive or predatory. It's not that no one's home behind his darting eyes. Everyone and everything he needs to be is home, waiting for the call.</p><p>Another reason to care about him is the actor who plays him. Mr. Rex has had a career of no great distinction—it includes a few ventures into the world of adult films when he was starting out. Yet his portrayal of Mikey is a memorable spectacle, an engine of huge urgency for a jalopy with a slipping clutch and no steering gear. And Mikey is matched, in his lust for a life that's beyond him, by the girl in the doughnut shop, who calls herself Strawberry because of her red hair. Suzanna Son plays the quick-serve nymphet with slow-burn seductiveness that locates her somewhere between Lolita and Tuesday Weld's cheerleader in \"Pretty Poison.\" Mikey sees Strawberry as star material. Mr. Baker must have seen Ms. Son in the same light. Both of them are right.</p><p>Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</p><p>'Red Rocket' Review: A Manchild's Adult Entertainment</p>",
