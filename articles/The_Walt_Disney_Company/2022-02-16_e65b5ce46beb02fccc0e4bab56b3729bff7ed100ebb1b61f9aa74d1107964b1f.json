  "title": "Disney to Develop Residential Communities With Condos, Houses; First project to be a community in California's Coachella Valley surrounding a 24-acre lagoon",
  "text": "<p>Disney has found success beyond its theme-park business in other segments, including its cruise line, and aims to build on that by developing residential communities, Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said in a promotional video.</p><p>\"While we're known most for our theme-park experiences, we've built an incredible legacy of going beyond the parks,\" he said.</p><p>Disney said the Rancho Mirage community is being developed in collaboration with Scottsdale, Ariz.-based DMB Development.</p><p>Disney didn't provide details about the projected cost of the project or the properties within Cotino, or when it would open the development for reservations.</p><p>Cotino will include at least one section expressly for residents 55-years-old and above, the company said. Home buyers will be able to choose from estates, single-family homes and condominiums.</p><p>Per the site approval, the community is expected to surround a roughly 24-acre lagoon built sustainably with low water consumption and minimal energy usage, Disney said.</p><p>Residents will be able to get a membership that provides access to a waterfront clubhouse, a club-only beach area and recreational water activities, as well as Disney programming, entertainment and activities throughout the year.</p><p>The development also has plan approval for a mixed-use district that can host shopping, dining and entertainment venues as well as a beachfront hotel and a beach park with recreational activities that can be accessed by a day pass.</p><p>Other locations across the U.S. are under consideration for future development, Disney said.</p><p>At each location, Disney cast members will operate the community association, the company said.</p><p>Disney, for years already, has sold luxury vacation homes through its 980-acre gated Golden Oak community in Florida.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Disney to Develop Residential Communities With Condos, Houses</p>",
