  "title": "Where Journal Readers Went When Travel Opened Back Up—and What It Was Like; Readers say they felt new appreciation for the freedom to be out in the country and world, and to reconnect with friends and family",
  "text": "<p>Our family of four adapted quite easily to Covid-19, despite 14 months of lockdown. Without the social distractions of school, our two teenage daughters thrived with remote Zoom learning, taking a heavy workload of college and high-school classes. But Covid-19 spanned two \"grueling\" Minnesota winters. By the end of a Minnesota winter, every resident's thoughts dwell on fleeing the state.</p><p>In May, we joined a stampede out of Minnesota, following a thunderous herd of friends to Las Vegas and Zion National Park. We rewarded our daughters for their hard work and impressive grades with their own penthouse-like room at the Four Seasons hotel. Every teenage girl wants to be spoiled. Las Vegas and the Four Seasons pampered them to ruin. Like a spring thaw, the scenic drive to Zion dispelled every thought of harsh winter, leaving just joy. It turned into fairyland magic as we crossed into southern Utah, through meandering strata of rust-colored sandstone formations of the eroded Colorado Plateau. The park seemed surreal even by Disney/Universal Studio standards. We returned home, happy and willing to endure Covid-19 and another Minnesota winter.</p><p>Thomas Fix, Stillwater, Minn.</p><p>I had been fully vaccinated since March and my mom was about to get her second Covid-19 shot in late April, so we decided to visit Holland, Mich., for the Tulip Time Festival in early May. We'd thought about visiting for years, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to take advantage of our recent vaccinations while also keeping some control by driving. We hit traffic in Illinois, which felt hilarious. Newly vaccinated, we felt like we were the first humans venturing out into the world again. Clearly, we were not.</p><p>We did feel a sense of freedom being able to route our trip as we pleased, stopping at Warren Dunes State Park, grabbing hot dogs and ice cream at a shop outside the entrance before heading in. We had reviewed hotels and Airbnbs and opted for a Holiday Inn Express outside of downtown. The hotel asked guests to wear masks in common areas, the pool required reserved times, and the breakfast buffet was served to you from behind a counter. We had done a bit of homework on how the hotel amenities were functioning in the age of Covid, so this all felt extremely normal. It was well-run, we never felt inconvenienced, and always felt very safe.</p><p>That feeling of normalcy shifted when we first reached downtown Holland for Tulip Time. As we took in the vast outdoor gardens, unmasked, among a throng of fellow tourists, I felt an overwhelming strangeness. A very typical occurrence just a year before was now an oddity. However, that strangeness found itself paired with an overwhelming joy. We had made it. We were on the other side. We were safe, we were together, and now the only concern we had was should we eat a normal lunch or dine on ice cream and mochas like delinquents? I think everyone in the crowd felt the same simple contentedness that comes from being out with your community.</p><p>In the following days, we visited other parks along Lake Michigan's eastern shore and moseyed home exactly when we felt like it. Shortly after we began driving, we spotted a roadside sign for a Big Boy restaurant, a chain I knew about, but had never been to. We quickly steered to the off-ramp, our appetite for adventure still in peak form. At just 10:30 in the morning, we couldn't help but to order milkshakes in celebration of our discovery. They tasted like hope.</p><p>Samantha Longshore, Milwaukee</p><p>We traveled from San Francisco to New York. I wanted to see friends in New York City, and I was traveling with people who were going to New York for the first time. But the primary reason was seeing my dad's sister who is in her 90s and lives upstate.</p><p>I arrived too late for my flight to be worried about the airport, but I worried about Covid on the plane, especially when I had to take off my mask to eat or drink.</p><p>Once I arrived, it was really thrilling to walk the High Line and explore New York City since this was the first real vacation I had since going to Catalina Island with my girlfriend in March 2020 right before the pandemic. It was a combination of worry and excitement almost the whole trip—the Statue of Liberty and Times Square were great, but both those areas were also very crowded.</p><p>One of the highlights of the whole trip was kayaking in Lake George near Silver Bay. It was beautiful and serene and I was far enough away from my cousins in their separate boats that I was able to enjoy it without worrying about the coronavirus. I was content and relaxed.</p><p>It was quite a whirlwind trip, but it was great because of the adventures with my girlfriend and her boys and reconnecting with friends and relatives. I do, however, think it was a little risky because of the Delta variant.</p><p>John Robinson, Pinole, Calif.</p><p>I traveled to an organic mountain farm in Costa Rica near the beach town of Sámara and lived there for a month. I chose it because it was remote (still being safety-minded) and, after 16 months of fear and stress inside the four walls of my apartment, it felt like such a luxury to take joy in the magnificence of nature and fresh air.</p><p>The trip exceeded my expectations—apart from the sheer beauty, it was wonderful to be meeting people from around the world again. My Airbnb hosts were so delightful and taught me so much about the region, and the eponymous owner of the bakery food truck in town, Sweeties by Celia, makes the best chocolate truffle cake! Not to mention I could have awakened to that view and the sounds of howler monkeys every day for the rest of my life.</p><p>Emma Baker, Chicago</p><p>In late June my youngest son and I took our first trip to Nashville to visit my oldest son and his wife. We flew from LaGuardia Airport. It was jumping and the security line was chaotic, but we navigated the chaos and boarded the plane, which was booked solid and left on time.</p><p>The passengers were excited, and you could feel the buzz on the plane. As Nashville now seems to be a party destination city, I could sense that most passengers were ready to \"go.\" The majority seemed to be in their 20s and 30s and on their way to long-delayed reunions and of course—what Nashville is known for—bachelorette parties.</p><p>The city was clearly open for business, and coming from New York after a very long year, I got the impression that Covid was either officially over or it just never occurred in Nashville. We attended two music venues and enjoyed the shows, which appeared to be sold out. On Sunday morning I attended Catholic Mass and I was impressed with the number of people in the congregation, not to mention the music, which was knockout! After all it was Nashville!</p><p>On our way back, the crowd on the plane was subdued, no doubt a result of the busiest weekend most passengers had experienced in a long time. A young man seated to my left called his dad right before takeoff. I couldn't help but overhear his conversation. He thanked his dad for a fabulous weekend, he told him how much he enjoyed his company, how much he had missed him and, most important, how much he loved him. He also told him how wonderful it was to see him again and how he couldn't wait to get back together, possibly in New York City. I had those same exact feelings for my son and his wife whom we had just visited.</p><p>I sat in my seat and realized how disconnected we had all become over the past year and a half. Disconnected from loved ones, family, friends, colleagues, church, even sports teams. In today's world we have the most advanced technology at our fingertips: FaceTime, direct messages, instant photos, you name it. I asked myself, is there anything better than having the ability to board a plane, travel a thousand miles in 2½ hours and to be able to hug someone you haven't seen in a year and a half or maybe longer? The answer was obvious to me—nope! It was fabulous to \"hit the road\" again, I knew it would be. Next stop?</p><p>Jerry Dolan, Brooklyn, N.Y.</p><p>We are just completing a 60-day Western states road trip including Joshua Tree, the Olympic Peninsula, Montana, Colorado and New Mexico. It's all been outdoor activities, mainly hiking. Our trip has been fantastic. We skirted the heat and the fires. Bless Mother Nature! It made us feel joyful following our Covid quarantine.</p><p>The biggest surprise of getting out on the open road again was simply the potential of the unexpected. Most days something delightful popped up, totally unplanned. From a parade down Main Street in the tiny town of Afton, Wyo., to the almost frightening geologic rock formations at Dinosaur National Monument, we were uplifted by the people and the beauty of our great nation. Every day thrilled us.</p><p>In the Covid era, you are chained to the news cycle. Your big plan each day is simply going out to do basic things. You worry about the smallest stuff.</p><p>Once we were traveling, the days were defined differently. Mornings are sunrises, fresh air, excitement about what will happen, suspense over whether we will find the trailhead, anticipation of the vista just over the next rise.</p><p>To experience this emotional range and physical hard work is to be unchained. In juxtaposition to the uncertainty and fear we felt from Covid, travel has freed us both mentally and physically.</p><p>Jim Hahn and Randy Stone, Scottsdale, Ariz.</p><p>We went to Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas in March. It was an amazing trip with my husband and two teenagers. As a physician, I was looking for a warm destination with low Covid numbers as I had been vaccinated but my family had not. A beach and some private excursions were all we needed. The beaches were like none we had ever been to before—the sand was almost silky and the water was the clearest turquoise.</p><p>There isn't much on the island, no fancy restaurants, but the local food on the beaches was delightful. We ate conch fritters daily. The grocery store had a limited selection of fruits and vegetables so you have to be creative. We took a 15-minute water-taxi ride to Stocking Island to have lunch at Chat 'N' Chill. The ceviche conch salad was delicious as were their frozen drinks. We rented a car to explore the island.</p><p>The Tropic of Cancer runs through Little Exuma. It is off the beaten path so there was literally no one on the beach. There is a little bar at the entrance with a line marking the Tropic, and it's a cool photo op. The water was simply pristine and as clear as a swimming pool.</p><p>And of course, a visit to the Exumas wouldn't be complete without swimming with the pigs. It was totally worth it!</p><p>Amanda Messina, Rye, N.Y.</p><p>Our family just came back from a week in Brazil, where we took our kids to visit their grandparents. Having not seen them in two years, and with one of their grandfathers turning 100 in a few months, we figured now was the best time. We postponed this trip as much as we could, given the high number of cases in Brazil. But we knew if we did not travel now, then we'd most likely have to wait another year before everyone's schedules aligned again.</p><p>It was a bit daunting, both the prospect of the trip and getting tested 72 hours before each flight. Covid testing in the U.S. went well, with results from a local pharmacy coming in on time, but in Brazil we used a self-administered test which required someone guiding us via video call. We were in locations with poor internet and at times the wait to join a call was over an hour and a half. Luckily, we realized the option for a video call in Spanish was much faster, and we were quickly able to complete our individual tests.</p><p>It also surprised us that in Brazil people seemed to be taking the pandemic much more seriously than in the U.S. Everyone was masked, even outdoors while walking the dog. It seemed a bit excessive, but at least cases seemed to be declining while vaccinations were ramping up.</p><p>During the pandemic we could only talk to my dad on the phone. As he is hard of hearing, these conversations don't last long and are never satisfying. It was just a great feeling to be able to be with him for a few days, to be able to hug, to touch him, and to better communicate without constraints. It is one thing to tell him that the kids are growing, and another for him to see them personally. It was also fun for the whole family to play dominoes with him. He is very competitive and still has a very sharp mind for the game!</p><p>I am hoping the pandemic situation gets better and that we can go back to see him during spring break next year, when he turns 100.</p><p>Augusto Morais, College Station, Texas</p><p>Given the crowds at the airport and on planes, higher costs, and the uncertainties of arriving where and when scheduled, I opted for a 12-hour drive.</p><p>My destination was only special because I visited my husband in Iowa, and we hadn't seen each other since October 2019. We've lived in two different states for years and, until Covid, have always been able to visit several times a year.</p><p>It was freeing to travel again, especially by car as it turned out. Leaving on my own schedule (4:30 a.m.), listening to whatever I wanted to (first two Harry Potter books read by Jim Dale), eating what I'd prepared at home, and taking whatever I wanted with me (including a TV set).</p><p>In a car you can see where you're going and you have reserved seating, lots of leg room, and no chance of being bumped from the plane.</p><p>Sights along the interstate highways were educational and entertaining. It was fun to speculate that California cars were moving out of the state; that cars from more Eastern or Southern states were moving west. There were RVs of all sizes—from single-person sleepers to house-size motor homes towing cars, motorcycles, bikes, ATVs. Trucks carrying all kinds of freight, like cattle, mail, food, siding, mysterious loads and my favorites—those shining white blades for industrial windmills that are over 100 feet long.</p><p>My car will now be my preferred method of travel, unless I'm going overseas.</p><p>Laura Andrews, Littleton, Colo.</p><p>We just returned from a week in Rome, traveling with my family and some friends, a group of eight, from age 19 to 52, all of us vaccinated. We found the city fully open with very light crowds. We wore masks while shopping indoors. Other than that, there was not much talk about the virus. Delta did not seem to be impacting Rome. Locals were ecstatic about seeing an American family enjoying the Eternal City. Travel was easy. I have been telling all my friends—right now is a great time to visit Italy.</p><p>The trip was originally planned for March of last year as a spring break trip for my son James and two friends. It was their senior year in high school. We kept the dream alive and rescheduled as soon as Italy opened up to visitors from the States. The pandemic affected our trip in a way we didn't anticipate: We felt a stronger sense of common humanity. Traveling to Rome was an opportunity to see the pandemic as a shared experience around the world.</p><p>Patrick Cox, Branson, Mo.</p><p>My husband and I went to Maine in June. I chose it because Maine had high vaccination rates, and we could do most activities outdoors. It was a great trip! We felt safe with the rules enforced there. Places we visited had a good energy but weren't too crowded. It felt so good to be back around people and the energy of a busy restaurant, for example, without being scared that they could make me or someone I love sick.</p><p>I understood the risks and didn't feel so much pressure to have everything planned out. I found I could actually enjoy discovery and adventure again without fear.</p><p>The trip was exactly what we needed to \"forget\" about the pandemic and all the anxiety that goes with it. Now we're back to it, though, with the concern about Delta breakthrough infections.</p><p>Carmen Pippenger, Indianapolis</p><p>I hadn't seen my parents in almost two years because of the pandemic. My constant fear had been that I would be the one to transmit the disease to them. \"I feel fine, but what if I am asymptomatic?\" I would constantly think. So I waited for the promised vaccine, and waited some more until I finally felt safe enough to see them.</p><p>The trip was long, from the deserts of Nevada to the woods of Virginia. Here I was, finally fully immune, or so I thought. I should have felt confident, free to embrace them. But each new headline seemed to chirp about a new variant, each worse than the last, and how even the vaccinated could still spread the virus.</p><p>So here I was, on a trip where I thought I could finally feel safe and less paranoid, but it was not so. Instead of boarding the return flight with a sense of gratification, I left with fear, thinking I might have exposed them to the virus.</p><p>Matthew Horne, Mesquite, Nev.</p><p>In June, I took a beach getaway to Maine with my college friend. Our goal was sun, lobster and relaxation. We stayed in a beautiful cottage right on the water, and ate lobster every day! It was not too crowded as it was early in the season. The beach was perfect, and I woke every morning to capture the sunrise. Everyone we met went out of their way to make us welcome.</p><p>The trip brought so much pure joy. To be able to celebrate our (well-earned) retirements, finally, and at a favorite location of mine, reuniting and sharing till the wee hours of the morning. It made me feel young again. The freedom of travel—to get in a car and go somewhere beautiful—is something that I will not take for granted ever again. I am so grateful to be vaccinated and healthy, and to be an American.</p><p>The only bad part of my trip was having to come home!</p><p>Lorraine Ziek, South Kortright, N.Y.</p><p>We took a family road trip during the third week of July 2021. We traveled to St Augustine, Fla., and spent the week visiting indoor and outdoor attractions as well as spending time on the beach. Being fully vaccinated, we felt no stress over the crowds and enjoyed dining indoors at several establishments. The biggest disappointment was the continued lack of staffing in restaurants leading to long waits and often subpar service.</p><p>The trip was special because our son, David, 23, had recently graduated from Tennessee Tech University and our daughter, Hannah, 20, was able to join us as well while on summer break. She attends TTU also. As parents of adult kids, my wife, Karen, and I know that opportunities for the four of us to travel as a family will be harder to come by in the future. So, we made it an old-fashioned road trip. We enjoyed local eateries like the Donut Experiment where you select the filling, topping and glaze for each doughnut. My daughter studies housing and design and enjoyed the architecture of St. Augustine, especially Flagler College's rotunda and Tiffany stained-glass windows. My son, who majored in marketing, is the beach bum of the family, and we enjoyed several afternoons on St. Augustine beach and watching sailboats on the Matanzas River. In addition to eating a lot of great seafood, we also enjoyed a bunch of lighthearted tourist diversions like miniature golf, a visit to the St. Augustine Alligator Farm, museums from serious to pirate-themed, and just hanging out in our rental cottage.</p><p>We were blessed to have the time to take a summer road trip this year. But we didn't view it as a \"break out from the pandemic.\" We have worked in an office, traveled, shopped, worshiped, attended classes in person and online, and hosted family celebrations of birthdays, holidays and graduations throughout the pandemic. We followed reasonable precautions including masks where required, hand sanitizer and staying out of strangers' personal space, but otherwise we tried to continue with life. Like everyone else, we have lost friends to the pandemic. Maybe the pandemic made the days a little longer and the year a little shorter, but there was still plenty of opportunity for joy and family fun.</p><p>This trip was taken a couple of weeks before the Delta variant surge began. So, emotionally, the trip felt like a return to normal. We hoped it was the start of a time when we no longer worried about who we would offend by wearing a mask or not wearing a mask or any number of other triggers that pandemic stress has created. As it turns out, we weren't out of the woods yet. While that doesn't change our perspective on the fun we had on our trip, it reminds us that we will need to continue to extend an extra measure of patience and grace as we work through the balance of the pandemic. Traveling reminded us that some things don't change: Twizzlers and Mountain Dew are the preferred road-trip vices, driving through Atlanta is still awful, and family time is the best time.</p><p>Adam Bernhardt, Cookeville, Tenn.</p><p>I was afraid of bringing Covid right to my mom's door. We mutually decided it was worth the risk. I went alone and spent five days with her. Honestly, it was difficult. She struggles with COPD and emphysema.</p><p>I was really scared because the airlines were filling flights to capacity. Enforced masking in airports and for the entire flight was crucial to my decision to go. While waiting to disembark I noticed the man who sat in front of me was wearing his mask below his nose. I said something, loudly (but politely!), and he fixed it. A woman in a gorgeous burqa sitting across the aisle looked at me and said, \"Good job!</p><p>That made my day! Between Covid fear and worrying about my mom, some things were made clear to me about the rest of my life and how I want it to go.</p><p>Meredith Phillips, East Hartford, Conn.</p><p>My group of eight college friends decided to rent an Airbnb for the entire month of December 2020. We decided on Charleston, S.C., because it was not a popular holiday destination and it had warm beaches.</p><p>We found a large house to rent to work from home during the first half of the month, visiting local attractions and coffee shops. Most of us took days off during the second half and went on mini-trips from Charleston and relaxed together.</p><p>It ended up being one of the best vacations. Covid made me realize that this type of extended, lazy trip is much more fun than the usually hurried vacations where you try to cram in as much as possible in the limited days off you have.</p><p>If there's one thing I'd like to keep post-pandemic, it would be the option to work from home for an extended time during the holiday season and spend quality time with loved ones.</p><p>Aravind Anantha, Raleigh, N.C.</p><p>Where Journal Readers Went When Travel Opened Back Up—and What It Was Like</p>",
