  "text": "<p>NBC made the bumbling football coach Ted Lasso a star attraction to promote US broadcasts of Premier League games. The campaign made his character — now an Apple TV comedy series — and European football a big success with viewers. Good thing. Comcast-owned NBC has just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c055f461-b3f4-44c0-b3d8-8254e17d4e87\">renewed</a> its US six-season television rights on EPL games for $2.7bn (£2bn), nearly triple what it paid in 2015. That will come as welcome news to the EPL and club owners.</p> <p>Media rights have provided the mainstay of Premier League clubs' income for the past three decades. In the 2019/20 season, broadcast rights made up just over half of the €5.1bn (£4.3bn) of league revenues, says Deloitte. Much of that has come from the UK rights, mostly held by another Comcast-owned group, Sky. But with this leap in value for the US package, the dependence on the home country has begun to diminish. </p> <p>This year, the Premier League agreed a deal to roll over its existing £5bn three-year broadcasting contract with Sky, BT and Amazon. That is about a tenth below the peak from the 2016-18 package. Meanwhile, this year's US and Scandinavian (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) rights agreements add up to £667m per season, against £1.5bn per season for the UK. Tack on updated contracts with other country markets, still being negotiated, and international rights could soon surpass that of the UK.</p> <p>NBC may well see this as a relatively cheap deal. Consider that it gets the sole rights to all Premier League games in the US. In contrast, to televise American football four broadcasters have recently paid $10bn to the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edee5842-7102-4786-9c02-20cfc536c559\">National Football League </a>to share broadcasts. No wonder it happily paid up to fight off competition from ViacomCBS and Disney's ESPN. </p> <p>Americans are no longer puzzled by the beautiful game. The country boasts some top players such as Christian Pulisic and US investors control top clubs such as Liverpool and Manchester United. Expect more to turn up as the popularity of the game there grows.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Premier League/NBC: US broadcaster pays up to renew rights ' FT.com 19 November.
