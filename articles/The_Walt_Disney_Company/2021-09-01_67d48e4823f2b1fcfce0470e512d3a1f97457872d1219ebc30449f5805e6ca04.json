  "text": "<p>If you plan to hit the road or take to the skies over the holiday weekend, travel agents say you should plan ahead and keep an eye on changing vaccine and mask-wearing regulations at your destination.</p><p>Here are some common questions travel agents receive and their advice for preparing for Labor Day travel.</p><p>How do I show proof of vaccination?</p><p>Before you travel, you should make sure you have digital proof of Covid-19 vaccination on your phone, whether through an app or digital record, travel agents say. You can scan the physical Centers for Disease Control and Prevention card on either an iOS or Android device to ensure the proof is readily available when needed.</p><p>\"You can put it on your phone in a notes folder or Dropbox,\" says Teri Goins, president of Campbell Travel, which is based in Dallas. \"Any of those file apps that you have on your smartphone is a great place to keep it.\"</p><p>You can also try downloading a third-party app, but use caution, because personal information is associated with vaccine records.</p><p>Do I have to be vaccinated to eat indoors?</p><p>Some cities require proof of vaccination for indoor dining, but individual restaurants can also choose to mandate vaccination for patrons.</p><p>New York City is one of the most popular destinations for Labor Day travel, according to the travel search company Kayak. The city requires proof of at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccination for many indoor settings, including restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, concert venues and museums.</p><p>San Francisco requires proof of full vaccination for indoor dining as well as bars, gyms and large indoor events.</p><p>Las Vegas is another top choice for the Labor Day weekend. The state of Nevada requires face coverings to be worn indoors in public in counties with \"substantial or high community transmission rates.\" This includes inside casinos in Clark County, home to Las Vegas.</p><p>Restaurants in other cities across the country are choosing to require proof of vaccination for their patrons. Apps such as Yelp allow businesses to list vaccine policies on their pages.</p><p>Do outdoor destinations require a mask?</p><p>In August, the National Park Service said it would require visitors, employees and contractors to wear a mask inside all Park Service buildings and in crowded outdoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status or community transmission levels.</p><p>In Los Angeles County, people who attend outdoor events with crowds greater than 10,000 people are required to wear a mask except when actively eating or drinking. This mandate affects people attending baseball games at Dodger Stadium as well as concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.</p><p>A small but growing list of teams are requiring proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a negative test to attend sporting events.</p><p>Has anything changed for cruise passengers?</p><p>With the rise of the Delta variant, many cruise lines require even fully vaccinated passengers to submit a negative coronavirus test within three days of departure and wear masks in some indoor spaces.</p><p>Starting Sept. 3, cruise passengers traveling to the Bahamas need to show proof of vaccination. Disney Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, MSC Cruises and Carnival updated their policies to require passengers 12 and up to be fully vaccinated for such trips.</p><p>What do I need to know about Labor Day music festivals?</p><p>Many indoor concert venues now require proof of vaccination or a negative test to attend shows, but outdoor events have updated their policies as well.</p><p>Electric Zoo, an electronic music festival in New York City, accepts proof of one vaccine dose or a negative test.</p><p>Some events have been called off entirely or rescheduled. Pepsi Gulf Coast Jam, a large country music festival scheduled for Labor Day weekend in Panama City Beach, Fla., was postponed until June because of rising Covid-19 cases. And Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival said it was canceling its Labor Day weekend event in Manchester, Tenn., because of the flooding caused by Ida.</p><p>What should I know about international travel?</p><p>Guidelines change often at international destinations. Campbell Travel's Ms. Goins recommends checking for information about vaccination and negative-test requirements before you go.</p><p>Not every country requires a negative Covid-19 test to enter, but Margi Arnold, owner of Creative Travel Adventures LLC in Denver, recommends taking one anyway. \"You don't want to get stuck,\" she says. \"You want to at least know before you leave: Do you have it or not?\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What proof of vaccination are you being asked to supply as you travel? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The European Union recommended on Monday a halt to nonessential travel from the U.S. because of the rise of Covid-19 cases stateside. The announcement suggested that vaccinated travelers would still be permitted into member states, though individual countries can set their own restrictions. Many European countries appear to be in no hurry to close the door to American tourists.</p><p>U.S. citizens who are driving to Canada must provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test, regardless of vaccination status. In addition, you can't have any symptoms of the illness when arriving at the border.</p><p>If you are returning to the U.S. from an international destination, you need a negative Covid-19 test to re-enter the country, even if fully vaccinated. This test must be taken no more than three days before the scheduled departure flight. Ms. Arnold recommends scheduling the test in advance if possible, or soon after you arrive at your vacation destination.</p><p>Write to Allison Pohle at Allison.Pohle@wsj.com</p><p>For Labor Day Travel, Keep Up With the Covid-19 Mandates</p>",
