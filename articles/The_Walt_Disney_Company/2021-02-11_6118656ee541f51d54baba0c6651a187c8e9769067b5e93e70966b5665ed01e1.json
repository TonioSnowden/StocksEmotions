  "text": "<p>Disney said the pandemic knocked $2.6bn from its operating income in the most recent quarter, as its once-mighty theme parks were shuttered or operating at limited capacity.&#xa0;</p> <p>And the world's largest entertainment company warned the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-economic-impact\">pandemic</a> would increase its costs by about $1bn in the current fiscal year, because it has to spend more on safety measures to combat the spread of the virus.&#xa0;</p> <p>It revealed, however, that it had lured nearly 95m subscribers to its flagship Disney Plus streaming service, the big bet that has cemented the legacy media group as a serious rival to Netflix.&#xa0;Disney shares climbed more than 3 per cent in after-hours trade.</p> <p>The stock has jumped by more than a third in the past year as investors focused on the promise of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/48cfb3f7-987a-4c22-85cb-a380301cbcfd\">streaming</a> instead of the billions of dollars lost to the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Subscribers to Disney Plus grew from 87m on December 2 to 95m a month later, the company said, helped by the Christmas Day premiere of <em>Soul</em>, a critically acclaimed Pixar film.</p> <p>Streaming is a costly business, as entertainment companies lavish funding on fresh shows and films to lure subscribers. Disney plans to double its annual content investment to about $15bn by 2024, at which point its streaming business would turn a profit, the company has predicted.</p> <p>Its direct to consumer business unit — which includes Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN — posted an operating loss of $466m on $3.5bn in sales during the quarter ending on January 2.&#xa0;</p> <p>Overall, Disney's operating income shrunk 67 per cent to $1.3bn in the quarter and would have been $2.6bn higher without the effects of the pandemic, it said. Net income of $29m compared with $2.1bn in the same quarter the year before, on total revenues that were down 22 per cent to $16.2bn. </p> <p>On an adjusted basis, Disney posted earnings of 32 cents a share, down nearly 80 per cent from a year ago, but eclipsing Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Source: Anna Nicolaou in New York 2021 'Disney Plus added 8m subscribers over Christmas ' FT.com 11 February.
