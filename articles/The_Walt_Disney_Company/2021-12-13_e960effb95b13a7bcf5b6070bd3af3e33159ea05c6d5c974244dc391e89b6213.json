  "text": "<p>When China and India had a military skirmish in the Himalayas in June 2020, it brought an unexpected consequence for the entertainment industry. After the conflict, in which 20 Indian soldiers died, the Indian government banned 59 Chinese-made apps, including TikTok. This left a space for short-form streaming entertainment — and Amazon stepped in.</p> <p>Gaurav Gandhi, the 45-year-old country head of Amazon Prime Video India (APVI), says it's been wise for the company to invest in this area: “The entire spectrum of video, whether it's ad-supported or premium content, still has very large room to grow . . . It's early days, but very, very exciting.” (The company does not reveal subscription figures for individual countries.)</p> <p>In May this year, Amazon launched miniTV, a free, advertiser-funded streaming service. miniTV, which sits within the Amazon shopping app, offers snappy lifestyle and drama serials and stand-up routines, some as short as TikTok videos, and is meant to draw in users who may then also choose to subscribe to the paid service.</p> <p>The potential market is huge. The global streaming market is estimated to be worth $71bn this year and there are now more than 740m mobile internet users in India, according to Statista, a figure forecast to grow to 1.5bn by 2038. The average Indian smartphone user spends <a href=\"https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/mobile/india-3rd-on-smartphone-usage-globally-users-spend-about-4-dot-6-hours-day-on-device-report.html\">4.6 hours</a> a day on their device, making the country an ideal testing-ground for Amazon Prime's most pioneering ideas. In January, its Indian division launched a mobile-only video plan — a worldwide first for Amazon. Partnered with the telecoms company Bharti Airtel, the company offers monthly plans that, after a 30-day free trial, begin at 89 rupees (£0.89) a month.</p> <p>“Mobile broadband is where most of the internet connectivity lies,” explains Gandhi over Zoom from APVI's offices in Mumbai's futuristic Bandra Kurla Complex. “India has the most affordable data in the world. It only makes sense to offer a mobile-only plan.”</p> <p>Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar offer similar mobile options. These innovations are democratising consumption: “People think of streaming in India being only available in the bigger cities and to more affluent customers,” he says. “But the reality with Prime Video is that we have a viewership in 99 per cent of the country's [postcodes] and in over 4,500 cities and towns, which means it goes super-deep. And it continues to grow rapidly.”</p> <p>Indians live largely in shared spaces with little privacy, which means that “95 per cent of homes in India which have a television have only one TV”. Traditionally shows catered to the widest possible audience — from grandparents through to teenagers and toddlers — making Indian entertainment a mishmash of genres. Gandhi likens the effect of mobile phones to the revolution in cinema that occurred with the arrival of multiplex theatres in the 1990s.</p> <p>“Single-screen theatres had a thousand seats and those films had to be everything rolled into one. Action, comedy, drama, all in one. When you had a 150-seat multiplex, you could create a segmented cinema. And streaming is doing exactly that to TV.”</p> <p>APVI's original content — 30 shows screened, more than 70 in development — demonstrates this range: gritty police procedural <em>Paatal Lok</em> (Underworld); upscale relationship saga <em>Made in Heaven</em>; <em>Panchayat</em> (Village Council), a gentle rural comedy. A quirky combination of international espionage and everyday domestic drama, <em>The Family Man</em> is Amazon's most watched Indian original at home and abroad. And there are standup series <em>Comicstaan</em> and reality dating show <em>Hear Me Love Me</em>. “We should have something for grandma and for the grandson,” says Gandhi, “and experiences to watch together.”</p> <p>It is showing Hindi and local-language films too. <em>Shershaah</em> (King of Lions), the biopic of a hero of the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan, was the platform's “standout hit . . . it went deep across the board”. <em>Jai Bhim</em> (Victory to Bhim), a Tamil-language legal drama, is an example of how “the language barrier is completely broken” by video streaming. APVI produces content in nine local languages, with dubbing and subtitles across all, as well as user interfaces in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. </p> <p>“People are getting more and more comfortable watching content that is not in their native language,” says Gandhi. “For many of our [local-language] films, over 50 per cent of the audience is outside their home state . . . The whole country is watching Malayalam cinema, Telugu cinema and Kannada cinema.”</p> <p>Amazon's internationalism also has its impact. “Indian films were generally only screened in 15 or 20 countries. Now, in the opening weeks, you're seeing these movies in 180 countries . . . Twenty per cent of the audience watching our original content is outside India.”</p> <p>Foreign content, too, is avidly watched by Indians, which offers new competition for Indian content-makers: a viewer can swap to something else the moment their interest wanes. “You have to focus on the highest quality,” says Gandhi. “It's not just about the stars, it's about great stories. The script is the hero.</p> <p>“The bar has continued to go up. In a few years time, Indian shows will catch the imagination of people around the world even more than we're doing right now.”</p> <p><em>This piece has been corrected to say that miniTV does not allow users to upload content like TikTok and to clarify that it sits within the Amazon retail app</em></p><p>Source: Nirpal Dhaliwal 2021 'Amazon Prime Video India country head: streaming is driving a TV revolution' FT.com 13 December.
