  "title": "Disney heir denounces Florida's ‘Don't Say Gay' bill after publicly coming out as transgender",
  "text": "<p>The bill, which critics have dubbed the “Don't Say Gay” bill,&#xa0;forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity&#xa0;in kindergarten through third grade or in a way “that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate,” and allows parents to sue school districts over perceived violations. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed the bill into law in March.</p><p>The policy has drawn intense scrutiny from people across the U.S. who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ+ people, and from Florida teachers and parents who believe the law is vaguely worded and could impact how families are discussed and history lessons are taught.</p><p>Charlee Disney, a 30-year-old high school science teacher who uses they/them pronouns, told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published this past weekend that they hadn't done enough to lobby against the bill.</p><p>“I feel like I don't do very much to help,” they said. “I don't call senators or take action. I felt like I could be doing more.”</p><p>Charlee Disney said they came out as trans four years ago. Charlee's great-grandfather was Roy O. Disney, the older brother of Walt Disney; the two co-founded the company together.</p><p>“I had very few openly gay role models,” Charlee Disney said. “And I certainly didn't have any trans or nonbinary role models. I didn't see myself reflected in anyone, and that made me feel like there was something wrong with me.”</p><p>The Disney family announced it would donate up to $500,000 to the Human Rights Campaign, one of the country's biggest LGBTQ advocacy groups, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>See also: Walt Disney World's latest attraction may appeal to its own workers: Affordable housing</p><p>Many people, including Disney employees, criticized Disney CEO Bob Chapek for not making a statement condemning the bill prior to its passing. “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,” Chapek said as part of a statement in March.</p><p>Disney employs 70,000 people in Florida and is an active political donor. The company&#xa0;donated $4.8 million to Florida candidates in the 2020 elections.</p><p>The Disney company released a statement denouncing the bill after it passed, prompting DeSantis to say that the company had “crossed a line.”</p>",
