  "text": "<p>   In \"Slavery, Anti-Semitism and Harvard's Missing Moral Compass\" (op-ed, May 14), Ruth Wisse writes that Harvard's \"indulgent self-blame is an escape from moral responsibility.\" More and more U.S. institutions, Disney notable among them, are indulging in such self-blame and trumpeting their righteous adoption of the woke agenda. Perhaps leaders of these institutions should read the Bible: \"Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven\" (Matthew 6:1). </p><p>   Henry Scott </p><p>   Potomac, Md. </p><p></p>",
