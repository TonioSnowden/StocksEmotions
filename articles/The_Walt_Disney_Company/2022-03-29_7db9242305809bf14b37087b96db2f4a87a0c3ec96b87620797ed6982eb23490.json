Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill restricting teaching about sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools that has triggered divisive national debate. </p><p>\n  Supporters of the legislation, passed earlier this month by the GOP-led legislature, say it is aimed at asserting more parental control over children's education and prohibiting inappropriate classroom instruction. Opponents, including Democrats and civil-rights groups who call the measure the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, say it will censor discussion about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and isolate LGBT children who are vulnerable to bullying. </p><p>\n  The measure, which takes effect July 1, sparked demonstrations by opponents in the state capital of Tallahassee and elsewhere. It created challenges for Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Chapek, who initially sought to avoid publicly wading into the political debate but wound up in a spat with Mr. DeSantis. </p><p>\n  \"You've seen a lot of sloganeering and fake narratives by leftist politicians, by activists, by corporate media,\" Mr. DeSantis said at a bill-signing event in Spring Hill, Fla. \"We will continue to recognize that in the state of Florida, parents have a fundamental role in the education, healthcare and well-being of their children.\" </p><p>\n  The bill forbids instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade and bans it in later grades if not \"age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\" And it allows parents to sue school districts over alleged violations of the measure. </p><p>\n  -- Arian Campo-Flores </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  WASHINGTON, D.C. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Healthcare Spending </p><p>\n  Moderated Last Year </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  U.S. healthcare spending is expected to have slowed last year after reaching a nearly two-decade high driven by the pandemic, according to a new report by federal regulators. </p><p>\n  National health spending is projected to have grown 4.2% to $4.3 trillion in 2021, compared with a growth surge of 9.7% in 2020, according to the report from actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The slowdown came from a decline in the use of healthcare services and federal financial stimulus as Covid-19 cases fell amid a pandemic that has led to nearly 975,000 deaths and almost 80 million cases in the U.S. </p><p>\n  Spending associated with health, including immunizations and vaccinations, disease prevention programs, and epidemiological surveillance, is projected to have slipped 5.2% in 2021 to $212.1 billion after more than doubling in 2020. </p><p>\n  Looking ahead, national health spending is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 4.9% from 2022 through 2024, according to the report. Health spending is projected to reach $6.8 trillion by 2030. </p><p>\n  -- Stephanie Armour </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NEW YORK STATE </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Trump Firm Ordered </p><p>\n  To Provide Materials </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A New York judge ruled Monday that the Trump Organization must soon hand over outstanding materials that state Attorney General Letitia James subpoenaed for her civil-fraud investigation of the company and former President Donald Trump. </p><p>\n  New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordered the company to substantially comply with the subpoenas by April 15 and fully comply two weeks later. </p><p>\n  The office of Ms. James, a Democrat, has been investigating the business affairs of Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization since 2019, when former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen testified before Congress that the former president inflated some assets and deflated others for financial gain. Mr. Trump has said the investigation is politically motivated and denied the allegations. </p><p>\n  At issue are subpoenas from early in the investigation, which sought materials that included information held on Trump Organization employees' devices. </p><p>\n  \"We are in a truly unusual place with these subpoenas that have been outstanding for two years and three months,\" Austin Thompson, a lawyer for the attorney general's office, told the judge. </p><p>\n  Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told the judge that the company was turning over the required materials. The attorney general's office had made additional requests for information, Mr. Rosen said. \"Their investigation just continues to grow and expand,\" he said. </p><p>\n  The subpoenas discussed Monday are separate from those issued by the state that seek documents from Mr. Trump and depositions of the former president and two of his adult children. </p><p>\n  -- Corinne Ramey </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BUFFALO </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Public Money to Help </p><p>\n  Build Bills Stadium </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New York officials said Monday that they would direct $850 million of public money to build a $1.4 billion stadium that will keep the National Football League's Buffalo Bills in the state for the next 30 years. </p><p>\n  The new facility will have space for at least 60,000 fans and will be adjacent to the team's current stadium in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park, officials said. The state will own the facility, which could also be used for concerts or soccer matches. </p><p>\n  The Bills will direct at least $550 million toward the construction of the stadium, including a $200 million contribution by the NFL that was approved at a Monday meeting of league owners, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said. The new stadium is scheduled to open in time for the 2026 season, he said. </p><p>\n  -- Jimmy Vielkind </p><p></p>",
