  "title": "AMC Entertainment Refinances Pricey Pandemic Debt; The theater company received investor commitments for a money-saving bond deal, despite a selloff that has called into question the longevity of its meme-stock status",
  "text": "<p>The new bond will carry an interest rate in the range of 7.5%, compared with the 10.5% AMC has been paying, and extends the maturity by four years, to 2029, they said. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that AMC was in advanced talks to refinance some of its debt.</p><p>Wednesday's deal is expected to be the first in a series of refinancing transactions designed to reduce AMC's interest burden. The company's debt load stands at roughly $5.5 billion, and includes a number of other expensive loans and bonds taken on during the pandemic.</p><p>In early 2021, AMC became a favorite of individual investors, many of whom refer to themselves as \"apes,\" who helped push the stock price to eye-popping heights while posting on social-media memes of their love for AMC and commitment to \"hodling\" on to their shares.</p><p>The ape movement took on a life of its own, and AMC even acknowledged in a June 2021 stock offering that it believed the price at that time reflected \"market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals.\"</p><p>But AMC's stock has tanked over the past several months, as the Delta and Omicron variants of Covid-19 put a damper on theater attendance and the ape movement lost some of its momentum. The stock was trading around $16 on Wednesday, down 78% from its all-time high in June, and almost 40% year-to-date.</p><p>On Monday, the shares rallied back slightly after the company posted preliminary fourth-quarter results that showed revenue topping analyst expectations. In part buoyed by hit film \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" AMC said it expects to post revenues of $1.17 billion for the quarter, up substantially from 2020, but still shy of the $1.46 billion it generated in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>Some analysts have issued bearish calls on AMC, noting the company still lost almost $150 million in 2019, the last year before the pandemic hit. AMC will be hard-pressed to surpass its 2019 performance even if Covid-19 subsides, they say, particularly due to growing competition from streaming services like Netflix and Disney Plus.</p><p>AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron has argued the company is transforming itself into something different. AMC is now also in the popcorn business and has touted plans to start accepting cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu for ticket sales. The company has also rolled out a program to offer nonfungible tokens to its shareholders. Last year, AMC began screening some UFC mixed-martial arts fights at its theaters.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p>",
