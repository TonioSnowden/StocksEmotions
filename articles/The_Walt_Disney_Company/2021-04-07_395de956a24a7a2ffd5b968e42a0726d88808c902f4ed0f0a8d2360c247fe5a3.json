  "title": "SPAC Sees Digital Trophy in Topps",
  "text": "<p>Topps, known for its Bazooka gum along with trading cards, said it posted sales of $567 million in 2020, up 23% from the prior year. Founded in 1938, the company has licensing partnerships with Disney, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League, among others, and it provides gift-card offerings for companies including Airbnb Inc., DoorDash Inc. and Netflix Inc.</p><p>Topps first marketed its sports and entertainment digital collectibles apps in 2012. It recently expanded into nonfungible tokens, digital assets also known as NFTs that use technology behind cryptocurrencies to create unique tokens, each with its own identification that isn't replicable. These tokens serve as a digital deed for original editions of online art, music and even memes.</p><p>The SPAC sees Topps as \"well situated with a universally recognized brand to capitalize on the fast emerging market for collectible NFTs,\" said Jason Mudrick, founder and investment chief of Mudrick Capital Management LP, whose affiliate is the SPAC's sponsor.</p><p>The SPAC's interest in Topps' NFT expansion comes as the tokens have recently taken off in popularity following the sale of digital art for millions of dollars. Mike Winkelmann, a graphic designer professionally known as Beeple, last month sold his digital image online at Christie's for $69.3 million.</p><p>Topps and Mudrick said they expect the transaction to generate gross proceeds of up to roughly $571 million in cash. The additional capital will go toward purchasing shares from existing Topps shareholder Madison Dearborn Partners, which intends to sell a majority of its stake, and to fund transaction-related expenses, the companies said.</p><p>Mr. Eisner's firm, Tornante Co. LLC, will roll all its equity into the new public entity, the companies said. The transaction includes a private placement of $250 million led by Mudrick and institutional investors including Gamco Investors and Wells Capital Management, the companies added.</p><p>Topps will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker TOPP, the companies said.</p><p>Also joining the combined entity's board are Jill Ellis, the coach of the U.S. Women's 2013 and 2019 FIFA World Cup champions, and Marc Lasry, the co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, the companies added.</p><p>Topps is the latest company to go public through a SPAC, bypassing the traditional initial-public-offering process. Also known as blank-check companies, SPACs raise money in an IPO and then look for a business to combine with, in a deal that gives the target an alternative route to the public markets.</p><p>SPACs so far this year have raised more than the amount raised in all of 2020, according to Dealogic.</p><p>Topps and the SPAC said they expect the deal to close in the second or third quarter.</p>",
