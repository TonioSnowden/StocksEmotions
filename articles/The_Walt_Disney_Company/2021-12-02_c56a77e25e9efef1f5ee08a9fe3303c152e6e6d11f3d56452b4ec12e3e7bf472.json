  "title": "Disney Elects Iger  Successor as Chairman  ----  By Erich Schwartzel",
  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co.'s board of directors has elected Susan Arnold its new chairman, replacing Robert Iger, the longtime chief executive set to depart this month. </p><p>   Ms. Arnold, whose career in business has included positions at the Carlyle Group Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., has been a Disney board member since 2007 and is to become chairman on Dec. 31. She most recently served as its lead independent director. </p><p>   Her appointment is another indication of the changing of the guard happening at Disney when Mr. Iger leaves at the end of the year. As Disney's CEO from 2005 to 2020, Mr. Iger enjoyed board support as he oversaw a transformation of the world's largest entertainment company, mostly through a series of acquisitions that put brands like Pixar Animation, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm Ltd. under one roof. His departure closes a chapter for Disney as several other high-ranking lieutenants are following him out the door, an exodus that will cement Mr. Iger's successor, Bob Chapek, as the executive in charge. </p><p>   Mr. Iger was named chairman in 2012 and has served as the company's executive chairman since ceding the CEO role in 2020. Mr. Chapek joined the board in April 2020 shortly after he was named CEO. </p><p>   Under Mr. Iger's tenure, he had support from the board when it came to sticking around as CEO. The board approved a postponement to his retirement several times before he announced last year he was stepping down for good. </p><p>   In naming Ms. Arnold as its chairman, Disney's board is turning to an executive with extensive experience on boards and with consumer goods. </p><p></p>",
