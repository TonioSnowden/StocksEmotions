  "title": "REVIEW  ---  Moving Targets:  When Did  Hollywood  Get So  Gloomy?  ----  By Joe Queenan",
  "text": "<p>   2020 was a bleak year for everybody, but lots of people in the sports and entertainment world pitched in to lift the nation's spirits. Beyonce, The Weeknd and Taylor Swift certainly tried to keep America's chin up, as did LeBron James and Tom Brady. And reliably amusing politicians like Ted Cruz, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Marjorie Taylor Greene did their level best to keep the rest of us in stitches. </p><p>   Spoiler alert: Hollywood took a different route. A look at this year's most honored pictures shows that Tinseltown's philosophy was: If you felt bad before the movie started, just wait till it's over. </p><p>   Ready to see a personable young barista being smothered with pillows? You got it (\"Promising Young Woman\"). Hapless seniors being scammed out of their life's savings (\"I Care a Lot\") or succumbing to dementia (\"The Father\")? We got you covered. Jazz musicians fish-gutting one other? Check (\"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\"). </p><p>   How about a disastrous immigrant experience involving underachieving chicken sexers in Reagan-era America? Oh, yeah, that's \"Minari.\" Or an entire town shut down by a plant closing, being stripped of its ZIP Code, forcing depressed, penniless residents to flee to hideously downscale trailer parks? Yup, we're on it with \"Nomadland.\" </p><p>   In a year when tens of millions lost their jobs, some forever, Hollywood really outdid itself by churning out a series of movies in which people either had no jobs at all or had really bad ones. The aforementioned itinerant Korean chicken sexers try to make a go of it as farmers in \"Minari,\" but they are in way over their heads. Carey Mulligan's character drops out of medical school to make coffee drinks in \"Promising Young Woman.\" A down-at-the-heels repairman moonlights as a serial killer in \"The Little Things.\" And in \"Nomadland,\" Frances McDormand spends the movie crisscrossing the country in a disintegrating RV, going from one crummy job to another. This is what they mean by being \"laterally mobile.\" </p><p>   Musicians had a really rough time of it in 2020. Riz Ahmed's character goes deaf in \"Sound of Metal,\" ending his career as a heavy-metal percussionist. Chadwick Boseman, who died in 2020, played a troubled cornet player who kills off a fellow sideman in his last film, \"Ma Rainey.\" Meanwhile, in \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday,\" Andra Day sings the blues as the target of a vicious FBI campaign. </p><p>   During the Great Depression, Hollywood gave us cheerful, uplifting musicals like \"Shall We Dance\" and \"Top Hat.\" During the economically stagnant 1970s, we were treated to inspiring films like \"Star Wars\" and \"Rocky.\" This time around, when the last thing the public needed was another completely incomprehensible Christopher Nolan film, it got movies about con artists, rapists, botched pregnancies, dipsomaniacal screenwriters, corrupt judiciaries, inept or crooked cops, serial killers and those underachieving chicken sexers. Plus another completely incomprehensible Christopher Nolan movie. </p><p>   It is widely known that Hollywood makes its money off blockbusters like \"Wonder Woman,\" that the Oscar nominees tend to be serious films that the critics loved and the public either ignored or hated. These films allow people in the movie industry to pretend for one night that they are not in the \"Ant-Man 6\" line of trade. </p><p>   A lot of the films nominated this year were seen by the public only because they were streaming free on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. Not one was as good as \"The Queen's Gambit\" or the NBA All-Star Game. Indeed, I can honestly say that the only Oscar nominee that didn't want to make me slit my wrists was \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.\" </p><p>   Did \"Borat\" get nominated for best picture? Don't make me laugh. </p><p></p>",
