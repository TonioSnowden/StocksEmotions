  "text": "<p>   \"But, what I have always admired most about him -- and what truly defines him as a leader and drives his success -- is his humanity,\" Mr. Iger wrote, \"the fundamental decency at the core of his character.\" </p><p>   At the start of 2022, Mr. Chapek's lieutenants were describing him as a big-idea executive whose imprint on the company would soon be clear. Mr. Chapekordered division chiefs from Disney's movie studios, parks and other segments to brainstorm about how metaverse technology could boost business. </p><p>   In February, Disney hired a theme-park executive to head a new metaverse-focused division, and the company hinted at new projects involving fantasy sports and theme-park innovations. </p><p>   Then the real world intervened. Many Disney employees, fans and activists called on the company to oppose a Florida state bill that would prohibit classroom instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation for children through grade three and sets limits for older students. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek declined to take a position on what opponents had labeled the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill. \"As we have seen time and again, corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds,\" he said in a company message. His lieutenants rushed to calm workers in emails, noting the company's support of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender causes. </p><p>   Disney films had featured LGBT characters and story lines in such productions as \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\" and Marvel Studios' \"The Eternals.\" Theme parks held \"Gay Days.\" </p><p>   Mr. Iger, who had embraced Disney's progressive politics, tweeted what many in the company had wanted to hear from Mr. Chapek. \"If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy,\" he wrote. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek quickly reversed course. \"You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,\" he said in a companywide letter. Angry employees staged walkouts. </p><p>   Ron DeSantis, Florida's Republican governor, was displeased. \"You're a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you're going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state?\" he said at a public event. </p><p>   The governor later pushed Florida's legislature to pass a bill eliminating a special tax district that allowed Disney to essentially self-govern the land where the theme parks are located. </p><p>   The conflict alienated progressives, who had wanted Disney to take a strong stand against the bill, but also conservative fans, who complained that Mr. Chapek's response indicated the company's capitulation to left-wing activists. Ironically, while Mr. Iger embraced liberal causes, Mr. Chapek has a more conservative view. He hired former members of President George W. Bush's administration to staff his government-relations office. </p><p>   In late March, while the controversy was still raging, Mr. Iger told TV interviewer Chris Wallace that \"one of the things that CEOs accept as a responsibility is that they're going to have to weigh in on issues, even if voicing an opinion on those issues potentially puts some of your business in danger.\" </p><p>   Some company directors began talking informally among themselves about whether Mr. Chapek was still capable of steering the ship. </p><p>   One option they considered was replacing Mr. Chapek with board member Mark Parker, a former longtime head of Nike Inc., as an interim CEO while the board hunted for a successor. </p><p>   In June, Disney's board instead renewed Mr. Chapek's contract through 2024 in a unanimous vote. Two directors, Mr. Parker and Mary Barra, General Motors Co. CEO, had been reluctant to go along. Others persuaded them that support of the full board would boost his confidence and shore up his performance. </p><p>   The sniping continued. Soon after the contract announcement, Mr. Iger told a friend he believed Mr. Chapek was a failure in the most important measures of success for a CEO: internal satisfaction, investor relations and consumer support. </p><p>   An internal survey of Disney employees had found low morale. And, according to a survey of consumer confidence by the Harris Poll, which Mr. Iger followed closely, fans were falling out of love with the Disney brand. </p><p>   Despite the troubles, the contract renewal seemed to embolden Mr. Chapek. He held court at Disney's D23 convention in September, showing off a new beard. He visited backstage with stars who were there to entertain some of Disney's biggest fans. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek drew a few boos, a sign of how some of the Disney faithful had turned on the CEO. Some customers were upset by a theme-park reservation system that Mr. Chapek had championed. Park visitors could pay a surcharge to skip long lines at popular attractions -- on top of rising admission prices -- which seemed to turn the quintessential American middle-class vacation into a pastime for the affluent. </p><p>   Even casual Disney theme-park fans blamed Mr. Chapek for changes they disliked. Park visitors posted videos on TikTok and Instagram, saying rides closed for repair were \"Chapek'd.\" \"Bob Cheapek\" became a meme on fan sites and message boards, referring to the CEO's reputation for cost-cutting and higher prices. </p><p>   Inside Disney, creative leaders stewed over what they saw as dilution of their authority. Tension with Disney's TV and film executives had started in his first year, when Mr. Chapek reorganized the company to empower business-side executives to decide content budgets and determine whether a movie or TV show premiered on a network, streaming platform or in theaters. Kareem Daniel, who had served as Mr. Chapek's deputy in Disney's parks division, took charge of the new group making distribution decisions. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek defended the changes in a Wall Street Journal interview this year, saying that leadership required \"the courage to do the right things, given all the forces that want legacy.\" </p><p>   Between the end of 2021 and the summer, funds managed by Fidelity Investments had cut their Disney holdings by 30%, and the Sequoia Fund Inc., a $5 billion mutual fund with about 46% of its assets in tech and media stocks, had sold its entire 2.8 million-share position in Disney. </p><p>   Sequoia said in a letter to investors that proceeds from the Disney stock sale went to boost its position in Netflix Inc., Disney's biggest streaming rival. </p><p>   Disney shares were down about 40% for the year when the company's board met at the end of September. The meeting quickly became a referendum on Mr. Chapek's leadership. </p><p>   Ms. McCarthy told directors Disney would likely miss analyst expectations for revenue and profit in the coming quarter by a wide margin, catching Mr. Chapek off guard. Streaming losses were growing, she reported, and theme-park margins were shrinking. </p><p>   Board members Safra Catz, Amy Chang, Calvin McDonald and Derica Rice grilled Mr. Chapek over the company's poor performance. Ms. McCarthy addressed most of the questions, later telling associates that her boss had fumbled his answers. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek complained to colleagues that Ms. McCarthy gave numbers that they hadn't previously discussed, making him look bad. The board and executives had been given briefing materials, including the results Ms. McCarthy presented, before the meeting. </p><p>   Ms. McCarthy, 67, is known as a Disney devotee who during a battle with cancer often returned to the office straight from chemotherapy sessions. </p><p>   In an interview with the alumni magazine of Smith College, Ms. McCarthy described overcoming life's obstacles, including anorexia in her youth and sexism in the workplace. \"What I learned at Smith was I had the confidence to speak up,\" she said. </p><p>   Some of Mr. Chapek's recent moves weighed on her, including a programming strategy that also served as a way to shield losses in Disney's streaming division. \"Cute,\" she said disparagingly of the move during a conference call with colleagues. </p><p>   By October, relations between Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Chapek were so frayed that he didn't include her in a board meeting. He also told executives that she had lost focus, distracted by her husband's ailing health, and had become unstable, comments repeated to some Disney directors. Ms. McCarthy learned about it from colleagues. </p><p>   People who know Mr. Chapek said such language would be out of character for him. </p><p>   As the environment inside Disney's C-suite worsened, more executives voiced concerns in phone calls to Mr. Iger. Some worried Alan Bergman, the studio chief, and Josh D'Amaro, head of the parks division, might quit. In June, Mr. Chapek had abruptly fired Peter Rice, Disney's highest-ranking TV content executive, a move that remained on the minds of many creative leaders at the company. </p><p>   Cracks showed in the parks business, which for the past year had been Disney's most reliable moneymaker. Profit margins shrank in the fourth quarter. Bloggers and social-media influencers amplified visitor complaints about rising ticket prices. Market research by Disney found white visitors 55 and older souring on the parks because they viewed the company as \"too woke.\" </p><p>   At the end of October, Mr. Chapek traveled to New York for meetings with investors. He gave the bankers a rosy report. With his top deputies, Mr. Chapek was also optimistic about the coming quarterly report. Some of his executives described Mr. Chapek's demeanor as out of touch -- as though Disney was killing it, one said. </p><p>   On Nov. 8, Mr. Chapek gave a presentation in a fourth-quarter earnings call. </p><p>   Disney+ had added 12.1 million net new accounts, beating analysts' predictions and bringing its global total to 164.2 million subscribers. Yet its losses were 38% more than what Wall Street expected, approaching $1.5 billion. </p><p>   Analysts from MoffettNathanson zeroed in on Disney's projections for future profits. They had expected the company to forecast 34% growth in one significant income measure. Instead, Disney projected it would be in the high single digits. \"Rarely have we ever been so incorrect in our forecasting of Disney profits,\" the analysts said. </p><p></p>",
