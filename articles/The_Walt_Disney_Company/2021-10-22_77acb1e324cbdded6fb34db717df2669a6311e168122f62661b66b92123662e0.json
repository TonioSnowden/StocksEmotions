  "title": "Why Am I So Tired After Working Out? It Could Be 'Exercise Intolerance.'; New tests can diagnose the condition, and more treatment options are available",
  "text": "<p>Exercise can trigger asthma in people who don't ordinarily have it, and diseases and complications from infections increasingly are also seen as having a role in exercise intolerance. New research shows, for example, that some Covid patients who have recovered from acute infection after having only mild symptoms continue to have problems exerting themselves. And when post-Covid complications like myocarditis—an inflammation of the heart due to a viral infection—are present, it can make vigorous activity more difficult and sometimes deadly.</p><p>When looking for underlying causes of exercise intolerance, doctors can administer various real-time diagnostic tests while the patient is attempting to exercise on a stationary bike or treadmill. Such tests can involve invasive methods such as intravenous catheters to measure blood flow through the heart's chambers, or miniature cameras to observe possible airflow obstruction.</p><p>Challenging problem</p><p>\"With exercise problems it can be challenging to medically evaluate complaints, so it's important to get a comprehensive evaluation,\" says J. Tod Olin, director of the Exercise and Performance Breathing Center at Denver's National Jewish Health hospital.</p><p>Dr. Olin diagnoses and treats patients with a condition known as EILO—for exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction—in which the upper airway inappropriately narrows during intense exercise, frequently causing loud, gasping breathing and the appearance of respiratory distress. Previously known as vocal-cord dysfunction, it is often misdiagnosed as asthma, according to Dr. Olin, although patients can have both conditions.</p><p>To examine a patient, he applies a medicine that numbs and opens the nasal passages. He then inserts a small flexible tube with a camera that passes through the nose to the back of the throat. The scope is secured to a helmet the patient wears while exercising on a treadmill until symptoms develop. On a monitor next to the treadmill, Dr. Olin and his team can see whether the airway is narrowing at the level of the vocal cords.</p><p>While Dr. Olin sees this problem often in young elite athletes, it can also happen to middle-aged exercise buffs. Angela Minnefield, an avid runner, started having breathing problems while running at age 50. The Indianapolis pharmaceutical company quality engineer sought help from allergists, sports-medicine doctors and an ear-nose-and-throat specialist. She was diagnosed with vocal-cord dysfunction, and was advised to try yoga and to breathe differently. But the techniques she was shown did not help. She felt frustrated and unsure where to turn next.</p><p>Ms. Minnefield learned about Dr. Olin's program in a web search, and took off a week from her job in 2020 to work with him and other therapists at National Jewish Health's exercise-performance center. With the help of Dr. Olin's program, she was able to see her own vocal cords on a screen to better understand what was happening, and she practiced a breathing technique Dr. Olin developed—nicknamed the \"Darth Vader technique,\" because it can make the patient sound like the ominous character behind the helmet in \"Star Wars.\"</p><p>While exercising she learned to intentionally block some inhaled air for a split second by gently and partially sealing her bottom lip against her top teeth. In the same inhalation, she learned to break the seal and allow air to rush in. Done correctly, the maneuver opens the upper airway. And used in combination with stress-management and sports-specific approaches, the technique helps patients breathe more easily during exercise, according to Dr. Olin.</p><p>Ms. Minnefield, now 58, says at first she was in tears because she couldn't do the maneuver while running. But with practice she got the hang of it, and says it has all clicked into place. She recently got her running time down to just over an 8-minute mile, the fastest she has run in years. \"It has been a journey, but I finally started to enjoy running again,\" she says.</p><p>In another type of test, Darlene Kim, a cardiologist at National Jewish Health, looks for the causes of exercise intolerance in her patients by placing a heart catheter through a vein in the patient's neck. The catheter passes through the right side of the heart and follows the path of blood flow into the pulmonary artery in the lungs, enabling clinicians to take measurements as the patient exercises on a stationary bicycle. The resulting data can reveal early signs of heart failure, dangerous elevations of blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, and other conditions.</p><p>Right diagnosis</p><p>With the right diagnosis she can prescribe the appropriate treatment, such as medication, salt and fluid adjustments in the diet, or cardiac monitors.</p><p>\"We always want people to be able to exercise, as long as it is safe,\" Dr. Kim says.</p><p>The increased use of so-called invasive cardiopulmonary exercise tests in recent years has increased doctor's abilities to intervene before conditions become life-threatening.</p><p>Aaron Waxman, director of the pulmonary vascular disease program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, says that exercise testing is especially important for early detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the type of high blood pressure that progressively affects the arteries in the lung and over time leads to a form of heart failure and early death.</p><p>\"If we can intervene at early stages of disease, therapies can be even more helpful,\" Dr. Waxman says.</p><p>While shortness of breath is often linked to heart and lung issues, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that viruses play a role, too. Dr. Waxman was senior investigator on a study published in the medical journal Chest in August which found that patients who have recovered from Covid but had no heart or lung disease had markedly reduced aerobic capacity during invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing, compared with controls. The problem was associated with impaired regulation of blood flow and an inability to use oxygen efficiently, causing patients to feel fatigue, shortness of breath and lightheadedness, and to hyperventilate during exercise.</p><p>Dr. Waxman says the researchers believe that the Covid-19 virus triggers an autoimmune response that causes damage to the small nerve fibers that regulate blood vessels. These fibers also regulate other functions in the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems.</p><p>The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is also focusing on such issues in its post-Covid recovery clinic.</p><p>\"We are seeing a lot of patients who used to be able to exercise at a high rate—running marathons or riding a bike—and now they can't do it at all or can't do it as much as they used to,\" says Michael Risbano, co-director of the clinic and director of the advanced cardiopulmonary exercise testing program at UPMC.</p><p>Dr. Risbano says some of these recovering Covid patients are afraid to exercise. But, as part of treatment, the team encourages them \"to exercise within their own limitations, even if it is in small bouts.\"</p><p>Ms. Landro, a former Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor, is the author of \"Survivor: Taking Control of Your Fight Against Cancer.\" She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.</p><p>Why Am I So Tired After Working Out?
