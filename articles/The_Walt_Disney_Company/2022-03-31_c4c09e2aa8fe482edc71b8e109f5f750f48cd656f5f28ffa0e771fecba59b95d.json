  "title": "Lawsuit Challenges Florida Law Restricting Teaching About Sexual Orientation; Opponents call the measure the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, and suit argues it is unconstitutional",
  "text": "<p>\"This law harkens back, sadly, to some of the worst laws that have been passed in our country,\" including those that led to segregation, said Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for the plaintiffs. \"It's inconsistent with and hostile to our constitutional principles.\"</p><p>Ms. Kaplan argued a case before the Supreme Court that resulted in a 2013 decision invalidating a section of the Defense of Marriage Act, which allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. Two years later, the court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.</p><p>The Florida law, which Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Monday, has drawn national attention and triggered acrimonious debate. Supporters say it is aimed at asserting more parental control over children's education. Opponents say it is designed to censor discussion about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p><p>The law, which is scheduled to take effect on July 1, prohibits instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade and bans it in later grades if not \"age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\" It allows parents to sue school districts over alleged violations of the measure.</p><p>Walt Disney Co., a large employer in Florida, became ensnared in the fight over the law, coming under fire first for failing to take a public stance on the measure and then for opposing it only after it had passed. The company said on Monday that it would support efforts to get the law repealed or struck down.</p><p>The complaint argues that the law seeks to discourage discussion of LGBT identities in schools, while permitting discussion of heterosexuality. It says the measure's wording is so vague that it prevents people from understanding what exactly is forbidden. And, because the law provides parents the ability to sue, the result is a chilling effect on speech, the filing says.</p><p>The law creates \"a scheme in which parents can use the threat of litigation over vague statutory terms to menace school boards and intimidate teachers into offering a skewed, discriminatory curriculum,\" the complaint says.</p><p>Although the law has yet to take effect, the plaintiffs argue that it already has caused harm. They say some teachers and school administrators in Florida have said they would remove LGBT references from curricula and restrict discussions that touch on LGBT issues. One of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old sophomore, faces uncertainty over whether he can continue writing essays about issues related to his sexual identity, the complaint says. Another plaintiff, a teacher, worries about how she can teach without fear of losing her job, according to the complaint.</p><p>Bryan Griffin, a spokesman for Mr. DeSantis, said that he couldn't comment on the specifics of the lawsuit but that the newly signed law was designed to protect parents' right to direct conversations about gender and sexuality with their children and to protect young children from inappropriate content.</p><p>\"This law does not single out any particular group, orientation or identity. It does not prohibit student-prompted discussion,\" Mr. Griffin said. \"We are confident it is legal to protect young children and parental rights.\"</p><p>At a bill-signing event on Monday, Mr. DeSantis criticized what he called \"sloganeering and fake narratives\" by opponents of the law. \"We will continue to recognize that in the state of Florida, parents have a fundamental role in the education, healthcare and well-being of their childrenâ€¦We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.\"</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Lawsuit Challenges Florida Law Restricting Teaching About Sexual Orientation</p>",
