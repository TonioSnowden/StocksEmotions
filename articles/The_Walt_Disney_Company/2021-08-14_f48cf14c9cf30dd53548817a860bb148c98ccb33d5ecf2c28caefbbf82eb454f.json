  "text": "<p>\n  COMCAST CORP. </p><p>\n  CMCSA -0.7% </p><p>\n  This year's Olympics audience wasn't gold medal-worthy for NBCUniversal. The Tokyo Summer Games drew an average of 15.5 million prime-time TV viewers over their 17-day run, the Comcast-owned media conglomerate said. That is the lowest audience for the Summer Games since NBC started broadcasting them in 1988 and a 42% decline from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016. The company expected a drop in viewership due to this year's Covid-related challenges, with some athletes unable to participate and no spectators allowed in the stands. Comcast shares declined 0.7% Monday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS INC. </p><p>\n  AMC -6.1% </p><p>\n  Soon, you'll be able to pay for your AMC movie ticket with bitcoin. The theater chain and popular meme stock said Monday that its U.S. locations would start accepting the cryptocurrency by the end of the year. It's a move aimed at appealing to the Reddit investors that rescued the company from the brink of bankruptcy. During an earnings call, Chief Executive Adam Aron also said revenue tripled in the second quarter, and AMC was opening new locations thanks to the support of its new shareholder base. AMC shares fell 6.1% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  CONOCOPHILLIPS </p><p>\n  COP -1.9% </p><p>\n  The Delta variant could spell trouble for energy producers. Crude oil prices on Monday neared their lowest levels since May, as traders worry that travel restrictions and delayed office reopenings will limit fuel consumption. Governments and businesses have been imposing new limitations in an attempt to slow the spread of the variant. ConocoPhillips shares lost 1.9% Monday, while Valero Energy Corp. fell 0.8%. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. </p><p>\n  LUV +1.4% </p><p>\n  Southwest sees stormy skies ahead. The airline said Wednesday that the recent surge in Covid-19 cases is causing bookings to slow and cancellations to rise. Southwest's announcement reverses airline executives' recent optimism, as rising Delta-variant infections prompt cancellations of festivals and trade events. Slowing travel demand isn't the only challenge airlines face. Carriers are also contending with shortages of staff and aircraft spare parts, alongside bad weather, that have caused cancellations and delays. Southwest shares added 1.4% Wednesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  DOORDASH INC. </p><p>\n  DASH +3.5% </p><p>\n  People still have an appetite for delivery. DoorDash on Thursday said revenue rose 83% in its second quarter, as restaurants reopened across the U.S. and people began moving around again. The food-delivery company expects expanded offerings and delivery partnerships to spur growth amid uncertainty from the spread of the Delta variant. While the variant could boost the company's near-term fortunes if it discourages people from going out again, executives said it doesn't ensure growth at the same breakneck pace they saw in 2020. DoorDash shares rose 3.5% Friday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  MODERNA INC. </p><p>\n  MRNA -0.4% </p><p>\n  People with weakened immune systems can now get a Covid-19 booster shot. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday authorized giving a third dose of the vaccine from Moderna, or Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, to certain people who are immunocompromised. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said other people who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and don't need an additional vaccine dose at this time. The agency is reviewing whether an additional dose may be needed in the future. Moderna shares ended 0.4% lower Friday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WALT DISNEY CO. </p><p>\n  DIS +1% </p><p>\n  \"The Happiest Place on Earth\" is getting a little more crowded. Disney's theme parks saw a strong rebound in visitors in its third quarter. Key resorts stayed open throughout the period, and Disney executives said future reservations for the parks have already surpassed attendance in the recent quarter. However, Disney acknowledged uncertainty ahead. Last month the company reinstated an indoor mask mandate at its theme parks in the U.S. regardless of vaccination status, amid rising Covid-19 cases. Disney shares gained 1% Friday. </p><p></p>",
