  "title": "In 'Hawkeye,' a Marvel Avenger With Dad Energy; Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton tackles his branding issue in the latest Marvel series to hit Disney+",
  "text": "<p>For more than a decade, Marvel has seemed impervious to any superhero fatigue. Now, it is pushing a wave of untested crusaders with mixed results. \"Eternals,\" a recent movie that introduced names such as Ikaris, Kingo and Sprite, took more hits from critics than typical Marvel releases.</p><p>The challenge for \"Hawkeye\" is that it has to both make a lesser Avenger the main attraction and launch his successor into the Marvel pantheon. Adding to the stakes for the streaming TV series is the fact that subscriber growth for Disney+ slowed in recent months.</p><p>\"Hawkeye\" tackles the character's profile in its own way. As Clint's new protégé, played by Hailee Steinfeld, says to him, \"Your whole thing is that you're low-key. It's a very hard brand to sell.\"</p><p>Mr. Renner first appeared 10 years ago as one of the original six heroes who helped the Marvel Cinematic Universe achieve liftoff. And yet, \"he has kind of been the fifth Beatle of the Avengers,\" says \"Hawkeye\" director and executive producer Rhys Thomas, a former director on \"Saturday Night Live.\" When Mr. Renner hosted that show in 2012, the actor poked fun at his own character in a sketch where Hawkeye's quiver goes empty mid-battle. \"My arrow thing only holds 11,\" the archer explains to his exasperated teammates.</p><p>Clint's workmanlike presence is part of what makes a six-episode streaming series more suitable for him than the stand-alone movie Marvel originally planned, says Trinh Tran, a production and development executive at Marvel Studios.</p><p>\"He is skilled and worked hard to get where he is to be able to stand next to those Avengers. There's that human element, \" Ms. Tran says, adding that this is the first Marvel series she has steered herself as an executive producer. \"There's a reason I chose Hawkeye. He is like me and you.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think of Marvel's foray into television series? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Hawkeye\" is Marvel's fourth live-action television series on Disney+. The new show is part buddy comedy: Clint grudgingly becomes a mentor to young archer Kate Bishop (Ms. Steinfield). Repercussions from his stint as a ninja-like vigilante named Ronin set off the show's many action scenes. And the holiday setting provides a familiar TV backdrop that also sets it apart among other Marvel movies and shows.</p><p>\"Coming into this series, I didn't know that Clint Barton is a fanatic for Christmas. Learn something new!\" Mr. Renner says.</p><p>The story line and tone of \"Hawkeye\" was inspired by a series of comics by writer Matt Fraction and artist David Aja that spanned 22 books starting in 2012.</p><p>In that series Clint tangles with a criminal gang wearing tracksuits, befriends a one-eyed dog and sleeps with a woman he just met. The Tracksuit Mafia and Lucky the Pizza Dog are part of the TV series. But instead of hooking up, Clint is trying to get home for Christmas with his wife and children, who he reunited with after a mass-vanishing in the \"Avengers\" movies.</p><p>Self-awareness is a trademark of the Marvel universe, where superheroes enjoy a global level of fame, which in turn blurs with the celebrity of the actors who play them. In \"Hawkeye,\" Clint watches a character based on himself singing and dancing in a musical about the Avengers. In the bathroom, a fan asks the world-saving hero for a photo.</p><p>Mr. Renner says he is the reason for that scene. \"People ask for my picture at the urinal. All the time,\" he says. \"Selfie for your son? This is not the appropriate time.\"</p><p>More meta moments come through Ms. Steinfeld's character. \"To have Kate in a sincere and earnest way idolize Hawkeye requires that we also acknowledge in a serious way that Hawkeye is not the favorite Avenger of most people,\" says head writer and executive producer Jonathan Igla. The former \"Mad Men\" and \"Bridgerton\" writer says the Hawkeye character was one reason he took up archery about four years ago—a hobby that in turn helped Mr. Igla make his pitch at Marvel for the \"Hawkeye\" job.</p><p>In the show, Clint responds to Kate's assessment of his image by saying, \"What am I selling then? It's certainly not Halloween costumes or toys off the shelf.\"</p><p>That standing seems to be reflected in Disney's online store, where a recent search turned up seven Hawkeye products (including a toy bow-and-arrow set) compared with nearly 100 items for Captain America. Ms. Tran says the merchandising of Hawkeye gets a nod in the series, and that in real life, more merch is on the way.</p><p>Mr. Renner says it isn't part of his job to evaluate the branding around his character, though he is especially proud to be on the pajamas worn by his 8-year-old daughter.</p><p>\"Make fun of Clint for just having a stick and a string\" the actor says. But \"before they can crack the joke, we crack the joke on ourselves. What does that do? It makes you relatable.\"</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>In 'Hawkeye,' a Marvel Avenger With Dad Energy</p>",
