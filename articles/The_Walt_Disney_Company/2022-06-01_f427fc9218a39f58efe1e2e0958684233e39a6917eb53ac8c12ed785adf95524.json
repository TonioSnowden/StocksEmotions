  "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery Names Two Movie Studio Heads; CEO David Zaslav replaces Warner Bros. Pictures Group's Toby Emmerich with former MGM studio heads Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Zaslav's latest leadership shake-up underscores his aggressive approach to restructuring and slimming down the businesses after his Discovery Inc. combined with WarnerMedia, which had been a unit of AT&amp;T Inc., in a merger that was finalized in April. His changes have also been aimed at cutting costs across the company, including at cable television networks CNN, TNT and TBS.</p><p>Mr. Emmerich will remain in his current role through the summer, Mr. Zaslav said.</p><p>Mr. De Luca and Ms. Abdy—Hollywood veterans who most recently ran MGM Motion Picture Group—will have a smaller role than Mr. Emmerich has had. Mr. Emmerich also oversaw DC Films, the movie arm of Warner Bros.' DC Comics unit.</p><p>Warner Bros. plans to follow a similar strategy as Walt Disney Co., which breaks out its Marvel Studios superhero franchise into a separate business unit with its own creative executives, rather than having it report to another studio head. Mr. Zaslav may also seek to bring in a new chief of the DC Comics Studios division, according to people familiar with his thinking.</p><p>Mr. De Luca made a splash as a young film executive who championed directors such as Paul Thomas Anderson and David Fincher. Over the course of his career, Mr. De Luca has played a key role in numerous hit films including \"Boogie Nights\" and \"The Social Network.\"</p><p>Ms. Abdy has had her fingerprints on many successful movies, like Mr. Fincher's \"Gone Girl\" and \"The Big Short.\"</p><p>The duo oversaw movies together at MGM including \"House of Gucci\" and \"Licorice Pizza,\" both of which came out in 2021.</p><p>Mr. Emmerich presided over some of Warner Bros.' biggest and most critically acclaimed films, such as \"A Star Is Born\" and \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" Other hits made on his watch include \"Aquaman,\" \"Joker,\" the Harry Potter franchise title \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" as well as this year's \"The Batman.\"</p><p>Mr. Zaslav has promised to cut at least $3 billion in costs. Since early April, when Discovery assumed full control of WarnerMedia, he has begun a broad effort to streamline its management structure. In a surprise move, Mr. Zaslav in April abruptly axed the news-streaming service CNN+ after less than a month of operations.</p><p>Numerous top executives from WarnerMedia have left or been pushed out, including CEO Jason Kilar and Ann Sarnoff, the company's head of studios and networks. Also gone from the company are Brett Weitz, general manager of the TNT, TBS and TruTV cable channels, and Tom Ascheim, who oversaw children's programming.</p><p>Significant cuts are also expected in the months ahead, when Discovery and Warner combine various operations and eliminate duplication, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>News of the hiring of Mr. De Luca and Ms. Abdy was earlier reported by the Hollywood Reporter. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported that Mr. Zaslav had held discussions with Mr. De Luca and Ms. Abdy about possible roles at the studio.</p><p>Mr. Zaslav has spent much of his time in his new role immersing himself in the film industry and meeting with top agents and executives, people close to him said. Soon after taking over the combined company, he held meetings with the studio's leadership in which he grilled executives about recent flops including the Clint Eastwood movie \"Cry Macho,\" the Journal previously reported.</p><p>He also has said he wants the studio to prioritize making more theatrical movies and not focus on making expensive original films for HBO Max, the company's direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com and Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@WSJ.com</p><p>Warner Bros.
