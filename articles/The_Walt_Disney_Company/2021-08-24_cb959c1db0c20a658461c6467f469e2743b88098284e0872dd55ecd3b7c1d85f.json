  "text": "<p>The deal between Disney DIS and the Services Trades Council Union will require around 40,000 workers to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 22, according to the agreement, with exemptions considered for medical or religious reasons.</p><p>Unions so far have generally accepted initial efforts by</p><p>U.S. employers to require vaccinations, labor officials said, while pushing for input into medical exemptions and timing of policies that many workers haven't encountered before. Disney has said that vaccines are the right step for the safety of its employees.</p><p>Don't miss: McDonald's, NBCUniversal tell employees to get vaccinated before returning to work.</p><p>In the first weekend after Disney announced the mandate, the union received fewer than 10 calls from people concerned about it, he said. With those numbers, the union has focused on the details of how the requirement is implemented versus fighting it, he said, even if a portion of members oppose it.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>Most popular at WSJ.com:</p><p>Who are the Taliban and how did they conquer Afghanistan?</p><p>FDA approves Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people 16 and older.</p>",
