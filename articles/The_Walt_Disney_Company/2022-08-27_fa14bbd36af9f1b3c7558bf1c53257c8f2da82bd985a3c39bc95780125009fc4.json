  "text": "<p>\n  \"I know it sounds hokey, but every time I go, I feel like he's there with me,\" Mr. Arone said of his friend. Most visits, he doesn't ride any attractions at all. Instead, he just walks around for a few hours, eats ice cream and watches fireworks and reminisces about visiting the park with his late friend. </p><p>\n  But he chafes at recent changes. Previously, he could stop by Disneyland for a few hours after work any day he wanted. Now he can't go on the growing number of blackout days for annual passholders. </p><p>\n  The company said annual passholders like Mr. Arone \"are amongst our most special guests.\" </p><p>\n  Renea Warren has made the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World nearly every year since 2001. </p><p>\n  On a nine-day family trip to Florida in late July with her mother and daughter, Ms. Warren tried to save money by spending just two days at Disney theme parks, instead of the usual four. Park passes set them back more than $800; food was about $200; and they dropped $300 on souvenirs. </p><p>\n  Since Ms. Warren, who lives in Benton Harbor, Mich., owns a timeshare about 20 minutes' drive from Walt Disney World, her family will likely return to central Florida next year, but they'll consider rival attractions at Universal Studios Florida and SeaWorld, she said. Returning to Disney every year is no longer an option. </p><p>\n  \"Because of the astronomical expenses, I definitely think the magic is being taken away,\" she said. </p><p>\n  The Genie+ app feature replaced a system known as FastPass that used to come free with any ticket sold at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The new service -- along with a free version, known as Genie -- does more than make Disney money: It also helps the parks' operators direct traffic and spread people around the parks more evenly, to reduce waiting times overall, and upsell visitors by offering them promotions on food, merchandise and ride-reservation fees. </p><p>\n  Each park has an operation center with a \"heat map\" that tracks where Genie+ users are in the parks using GPS technology. Park operators can direct traffic using the app by notifying visitors where the shortest lines are and offering food and merchandise promotions to cajole them to other areas. </p><p>\n  In an analysis for The Wall Street Journal, Touring Plans analyzed room prices, including taxes, at three popular Walt Disney World hotels over the past decade, and found increases that far outpaced inflation, which in July hit a record high of 9.1%. </p><p>\n  Prices for tickets and certain food items have also climbed faster than inflation over the past decade, the Touring Plans analysis found. Disney fan blogs have noted that classic purchases at Disney parks, including the pineapple Dole Whip frozen treat ($5.99 last year, $6.99 this year at some locations) and studded Mickey Mouse-ears headbands ($29.99 last summer, now $39.99) are quickly getting costlier. </p><p>\n  Mariana Epperson, a 29-year-old mom from Kentucky who works as an account manager for a credit-ratings firm, spent part of her honeymoon at Disneyland, and Walt Disney World is the site of some of her final happy memories with her father, who died a few weeks after she took a trip there with her family in May. </p><p>\n  \"A lot of people will say, 'Oh, I can go to Europe for cheaper,'\" she said. \"But Disney now holds the last really good memories of my dad, so for me it's so important. I can always make more money.\" </p><p>\n  Even so, this summer, her husband told her he needed a break from the theme parks. They've visited Disney resorts six times since 2017, and the parks are getting way too expensive, she said. For their family vacation next year, they are thinking about a Disney cruise. Packages for three-night cruises from San Diego or Miami start at just over $1,000. An ocean-view cabin costs more. So do between-meal snacks and excursions ashore. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  More of Disney's </p><p>\n  Rising Park Costs </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Miss Piggy backpack: $80 last year; $95 today </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Mickey Mouse studded headband: $29.99 last year; now $39.99 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Trader Sam's Tiki Terrace margarita: Was $15; now $17 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- Magical Express: free airport shuttle for guests at Disney-owned hotels in Orlando.
