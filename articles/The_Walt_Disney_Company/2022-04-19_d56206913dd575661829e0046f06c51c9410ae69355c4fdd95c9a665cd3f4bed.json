  "title": "After its own Oscars slap and Wall Street smackdown, Netflix searches for a rebound; Earnings preview: Netflix stock had its worst quarter in more than a decade and Apple beat the streaming pioneer to the first Best Picture win for a streaming service, while price increase is unlikely to help with declining user growth",
  "text": "<p>On Tuesday, April 19, the company will report fiscal-first quarter earnings, after its forecast sent shares into a spiral in January. The stock plummeted 22% after its last earnings report, lopping off $49.1 billion in market capitalization and making it the worst quarter for the stock in nearly a decade.</p><p>A bigger loss may have occurred March 27, when Netflix's candidate for best picture, \"The Power of the Dog,\" lost to Apple Inc.'s AAPL \"Coda,\" allowing upstart Apple TV+ — which entered the streaming-service industry a decade after Netflix — to be the first streaming service to nab a best-picture win.</p><p>Netflix's loss, on a night when Will Smith infamously smacked Chris Rock with a roundhouse slap, was a creative blow for an operation that spent about $17 billion on content in 2021 and is expected to spend another $19 billion in 2022, according to Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson. Netflix appears to be reining in that spending — executives have twice warned employees in recent weeks to be mindful of spending and hiring, according to a reportin The Information.</p><p>Read more: A tortoise-and-hare story: How Apple beat Netflix to a best-picture Oscar despite its later streaming start</p><p>Netflix could make moves to diversify and find some new growth, like its foray into videogames last year. Needham analyst Laura Martin is adamant Netflix adopt an ad-supported service to carry news and sports, as its competitors have. In the process, Netflix would add 27% to 67% to total revenue with such an approach, she said.</p><p>\"Amazon and Apple are buying exclusive sports rights, implying live sports are the next competitive battlefield,\" Martin wrote in a note March 16 that rates Netflix stock as underperform. \"NFLX will lose to Discovery+/HBO Max/Warner, Paramount+, Comcast/Peacock, Apple+ or others, we believe, unless it adds live sports and news to its content line up, and returns to U.S. subscriber growth by adding an ad-lite SVOD tier like EVERY other streaming competitor.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, with price hikes rolling out to subscribers, some members could drop Netflix for its growing cohort of competitors. New net subscriber additions are expected to wane — analysts on average predict 2.81 million in the first quarter, and 2.64 million in the second quarter, according to FactSet. That would lead to a first-half total of 5.45 million new subscribers, slightly down from 5.52 million in the first half last year.</p><p>Netflix is trying to change the conversation, though, looking to highlight subscriber retention and the potential to continue growing over the long term. Netflix continues to command viewer loyalty worldwide — 70% of its desktop visitors watched it exclusively — despite a crowded competitive landscape that includes Apple, Walt Disney Co. DIS, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN andits new additionsfrom the MGM acquisition, AT&amp;T Inc. T, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Paramount Global PARAA and others, based on figures from data intelligence platform Similarweb in December 2021. Similarweb noted that fewer consumers are canceling Netflix, based on a decline in cancellation rate.</p><p>By the end of 2025, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth predicts Netflix can \"reach [more than] 300 million global subscribers based on 31% penetration of the 953 million global broadband subscribers, 42% penetration of the 720 million global Pay TV subscribers, &amp; 38% penetration of the 778 million maximum global Pay TV subscribers.\" In his March 30 note, Anmuth rated the company's stock overweight with a $605 price target.</p><p>What to expect</p><p>Earnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect, on average, Netflix to report first-quarter earnings of $2.90 a share, down from $1.57 a share a year ago.</p><p>Contributors to Estimize — a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others — are projecting earnings of $2.95 a share on average.</p><p>Revenue: Analysts on average expect Netflix to report $7.93 billion in first-quarter revenue, up from $5.77 billion a year ago. Estimize contributors predict $7.96 billion on average.</p><p>Stock movement: As of morning trading Tuesday, Netflix's stock has nosedived 41% so far this year — among the worst Nasdaq 100 NDX performers — while the S&amp;P 500 index  SPX has declined 6%. Shares of Netflix are down 34% since the company last announced quarterly results.</p><p>What analysts are saying</p><p>Analysts like Cowen's John Blackledge are concerned about Netflix's slackening subscription growth. In reducing his price target on Netflix shares to $590 from $600, Blackledge forecast paid net adds of 1.45 million, well below FactSet's estimate of 2.81 million, owing much to the suspension of 1 million subscriptions in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Citing uncertain macroeconomic conditions, Stifel analyst Scott Devitt last week lowered his price target to $460 from $500 while maintaining a buy rating.</p><p>\"Looking past 1Q, we are tempering our estimates for 2022 and beyond as we take a more conservative approach to subscriber and ARPPU [average revenue per paying user] growth given worsening macro conditions and continued uncertainty around when/if acquisition growth will return to pre-pandemic levels,\" Devitt said in an April 6 note.</p><p>It isn't all bad news of late for Netflix. \"If Content is King, Netflix Wears the Crown,\" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a March 16 note that rates Netflix shares as in line with a price target of $525.</p><p>\"This is why we believe Netflix remains a Top choice in any household's Streaming Bundle. Among the power Streamers that watch Netflix, Disney+ AND Amazon Prime Video, Netflix continues to lead in content quality, with increasing ratings for the 4th quarter in a row, while Disney+ has declined for the 4th quarter in a row,\" he wrote.</p><p>Mahaney came to this conclusion based on results of a recent survey of 1,500 people in the U.S. In it, 69% of respondents said they used Netflix, up 2% from the previous quarter, followed by Amazon (66%), Hulu (54%), Disney (53%) and HBO (40%).</p><p>Still, there are worrisome signs. More than half (52%) said they were \"extremely/very satisfied\" with Netflix, down from 61% the previous quarter — the largest sequential decline in years — because of increased competition and negative reaction to a recent price increase.</p><p>After its own Oscars slap and Wall Street smackdown, Netflix searches for a rebound</p>",
