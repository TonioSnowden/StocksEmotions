  "text": "<p>Abba were back on stage in London for the first time since 1979. A red carpet led into the newly built Abba Arena in the east of the city. Celebrities were pursued by roving television news teams asking for Abb-ecdotes. Inside, a group of men mystifyingly dressed in formal naval uniform turned out to be the real deal. They accompanied King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden as the royal couple took their seats in row C, directly behind the ladies and gentlemen of the press.</p> <p>For curtain-up, the four members of the band rose into view from beneath the stage. Björn Ulvaeus held a guitar. Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad stood frozen in the centre behind two microphone stands. Benny Andersson was poised over a set of keyboards. Cheers and applause greeted them, although the Swedish legends appeared deaf to the acclaim. Time had been kind to them. In fact, they looked unchanged from their final tour 42 years ago, back when a Canadian reviewer wrote that “for cool professionalism, assembly-line precision and computer-perfect programming, the show functions like a machine from start to finish”.</p> <p>The same is even truer of their return in 2022. Abba Voyage, opening for an initial seven-month residency at a specially constructed 3,000-capacity venue, is a technological marvel. The four figures on stage were computer-generated doppelgängers of Abba as they looked in 1979. Nicknamed “Abbatars”, they have been painstakingly created by George Lucas's special effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), now owned by Disney, with the assistance of the real-life members of Abba, who are in their seventies.</p> <p>ILM's first work was for <em>Star Wars </em>in 1977. As that film did to cinema, so Abba Voyage does to virtual concerts. It is a blockbuster spectacle that takes showbiz illusionism to new heights. The Abbatars are remarkably lifelike. Agnetha and Anna-Frid twirled around in bejewelled ponchos and velvety jumpsuits. Benny and Björn jiggled about as they played their instruments. They looked solid, even casting shadows. &#xa0;</p> <p>Their artificial nature was clearer on the big screens that projected magnified views of the computerised mannequins. Agnetha tried to look pained while singing lead vocal on divorce anthem “The Winner Takes It All”, but her smoothly pixelated features struggled to compass the inefficient human emotion of sadness. Observing the spirit of tech-utopianism, the Abbatars looked more convincing in close-up when they smiled, which they did a lot. And why not? Their show was a blast.</p> <p>A live eight-piece band and three backing singers performed with the beaming Abbatars. Disco classics such as “Voulez-Vous” were given a clubby, big-room revamp with a heightened snare beat, although not to the extent of suffocating their exuberant feel. Vocals were fluently concocted from previous recordings.</p> <p>The Abbatars were not just programmed to deliver the hits. “The Visitors”, title track of Abba's final album from 1981, was never performed live by the flesh-and-blood band, but turned up here as the opener. Its sci-fi synths suited the Abbatars. So did an electronically charged version of <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/life-of-a-song/gimme-gimme-gimme.html\">“Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man after Midnight)”</a>, during which a pumped-up Anna-Frid performed karate kicks in a clingy vinyl catsuit like a character from <em>The Matrix</em>.</p> <p>Songs from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2bcfda8-083a-49c2-8e66-ad94e4234618\"><em>Voyage</em></a>, the real band's so-so comeback album from last year, were limited to genial disco pastiche “Don't Shut Me Down” and orchestral power ballad “I Still Have Faith in You”, which benefited from being rearranged for a rock band. Digital Agnetha clasped hands with digital Anna-Frid as they sang it, looking into each other's eyes with a simulacrum of fondness. Grace notes of reality added to the hall of mirrors effect, such as TV footage of the actual band singing “Waterloo” at Eurovision in 1974. </p> <p>When the ageless Abbatars addressed the audience in pre-recorded remarks, they did so in the septuagenarian voices of the actual Abba members. The real foursome made a curtain call at the end, marking their first time on stage together for five years. They too were beaming, with good reason. The baton had been handed over to their digitally rejuvenated selves. Abba Voyage fleshes out the previously sketchy format of the virtual gig.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><a href=\"https://abbavoyage.com/\"><em>abbavoyage.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Ludovic Hunter-Tilney 2022 'Abba Voyage review — Swedish legends take a chance on technology and come up trumps' FT.com 27 May.
