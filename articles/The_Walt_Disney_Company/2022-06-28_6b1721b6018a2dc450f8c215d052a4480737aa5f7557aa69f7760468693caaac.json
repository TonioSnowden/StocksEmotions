  "title": "Disney Board Votes to Renew CEO Bob Chapek's Contract; Disney CEO will lead world's largest entertainment company for three more years",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Chapek's renewal was closely watched and speculated-on in Hollywood, especially after a high-profile dust-up earlier this year with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Disney, which employs more than 70,000 in the state, took a public stand against the Parental Rights in Education bill, a piece of legislation that curbed classroom instruction on sexual identity and gender in elementary schools.</p><p>Disney initially sought to stay out of the debate over the bill—now a law—but was pressured by employees and activists to oppose it. Mr. DeSantis spent weeks railing against Disney as a \"woke corporation\" that is out of touch with the values of Florida parents and supported a successful effort to strip Walt Disney World of its self-governing status in Orlando.</p><p>In addition, Disney's share price has fallen by nearly 40% this year as Wall Street's enthusiasm for streaming video businesses has cooled. Mr. Chapek has set a lofty goal for Disney+ to gain between 230 million and 260 million subscribers and achieve profitability for the direct-to-consumer streaming business by September 2024. It has markedly increased spending on content, including a push into sports broadcasting rights, to attract more subscribers.</p><p>The share price is up slightly in after-hours market trading Tuesday.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Board Votes to Renew CEO Bob Chapek's Contract</p>",
