  "text": "<p>Companies face pressure from shareholders, employees and local governments to take a stance on access to abortion as the Supreme Court considers overturning Roe v. Wade.</p><p>In the nearly five decades since the landmark 1973 ruling protecting a woman's right to have an abortion, the discourse about corporate responsibility has shifted. Access to reproductive health became a workplace issue as more women entered the workforce. Social media and greater shareholder activism also offer public avenues to call out companies for what they are doing, or not doing.</p><p>\"Corporates are in the crosshairs here; it's very difficult and they have to navigate this very carefully,\" said Nell Minow, vice chair at ValueEdge Advisors, which advises institutional investors on corporate-governance issues.</p><p>A leaked Supreme Court draft opinion published late Monday by Politico indicates the court might be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed in a statement Tuesday that the draft was authentic, but he said it wasn't necessarily the final resolution in the case.</p><p>It is essential for companies that value talent and see gender equity as a core principle to support women's reproductive health, said Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer of Trillium Asset Management LLC, a firm focused on socially responsible investing.</p><p>Boston-based Trillium submitted a shareholder proposal this year to TJX Cos., asking the retailer for a report on the risks it faces from laws restricting abortion access.</p><p>Trillium said that 40% of TJX stores, including the T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls chains, are located in states that could immediately prohibit abortions if Roe is overturned. Trillium will present its proposal at TJX's annual meeting in June.</p><p>Mr. Kron said Trillium would talk to other businesses in its portfolio over the next six months and ask them about how a patchwork of reproductive-rights laws would affect their businesses. The firm will likely submit additional shareholder proposals on this topic, he said.</p><p>\"We're so far past that, that companies can't try to be neutral,\" he said. \"They need to decide what they stand for and stand by that.\"</p><p>Even before the Supreme Court draft opinion was leaked, several companies had announced that they would cover travel expenses for their employees seeking abortions. Amazon.com Inc. told employees it would reimburse up to $4,000 annually for travel expenses for medical treatments, including abortions. Yelp Inc., Citigroup Inc., Bumble Inc., Match Group Inc., Apple Inc. and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. also have said they would expand care for reproductive health for their employees, including abortions, as more states move to enact increasingly restrictive abortion laws.</p><p>Companies that want to provide such benefits are on safe legal grounds, at least for now, according to lawyers.</p><p>A Texas law passed last year that barred abortions in the state after about six weeks of pregnancy extended liability not just to abortion clinics and doctors, but to those who aid and abet an abortion, such as transportation providers or insurance companies.</p><p>A Supreme Court ruling in line with the draft leaked Monday could open the door to similar legislation in other states, including laws that prohibit residents of one state from traveling to another for an abortion. But such laws might not withstand legal challenges, said Rachel Rebouché, interim dean of the Beasley School of Law at Temple University and an expert on reproductive-health law.</p><p>\"It's not clear where future lines will be drawn for these laws that could have further reach,\" Ms. Rebouché said. \"There are a lot of reasons to think they are unconstitutional on other grounds.\"</p><p>Despite moves to restrict access to abortion in many states, a recent Wall Street Journal poll found that 55% of voters surveyed said they wanted abortion to remain legal in all or most cases.</p><p>Ms. Minow said if companies oppose local policies limiting a woman's right to have an abortion, they could see retaliatory actions from state legislators, whose assistance might be needed for other business purposes. At the same time, companies face pressure from the other side, as more shareholders ask them to explain why they contribute to legislators backing antiabortion laws, she said.</p><p>The fallout from the recent political clash between Walt Disney Co. and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over the state's Parental Rights in Education bill has alarmed corporate leaders and heightened the challenges for chief executives navigating charged topics.</p><p>Charles Elson, the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, urged companies to stay out of political discussions and allow for diverse opinions among its workers, suppliers and customers.</p><p>\"Companies aren't equipped to do this; they don't have the same protective mechanism [as government entities] to do it,\" Mr. Elson said. \"It's a lousy place to resolve social issues overall.\"</p><p>Dylan Tokar contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p><p>Abortion Debate Puts Corporate Initiatives in the Spotlight</p>",
