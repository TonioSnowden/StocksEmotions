  "text": "<p>\"I'm not the kind that loves to seek the spotlight, but I guess looking back now, I'm glad it happened,\" said Mr. Baize, a 34-year-old accountant and business consultant. \"It was a sincere, honest moment. If it brought peace and hope to many, that's a blessing.\"</p><p>Whitney Brown, 32, was sifting through soaked clothes in Mr. Baize's bedroom closet when she heard the song, \"There's Something About That Name.\" Surprised, she decided to preserve the moment on her phone. \"It was so profound to me,\" she said.</p><p>Three days earlier, the siblings had returned to Kentucky from a trip to Walt Disney World in Florida with their parents and families, including Mr. Baize's 9-year-old son, Max, and 5-year-old daughter, Annie Grace.</p><p>On Friday night, Mr. Baize said he grew increasingly concerned about tornado warnings, inviting his ex-wife and her husband to his home because they don't have a basement. After an especially pointed alert, the three adults took Max and Annie Grace to the basement, moments before a tornado thundered onto Mr. Baize's 13-acre property. When the group re-emerged, the house was in ruins.</p><p>The next day, family members helped Mr. Baize salvage what they could. The tornado took off the roof and collapsed a wall. And the piano sat in the corner as always, so Mr. Baize gave it a go.</p><p>The song \"There's Something About That Name\" includes the lines, \"Kings and kingdoms will all pass away, but there's something about that name,\" referring to Jesus.To Mr. Baize, it was apt: \"My little 13-acre kingdom had been destroyed. But still at the center of it all, Christ is steady and constant.\"</p>",
