  "text": "<p>Venture capital raised by startups in Los Angeles stayed flat in 2021's fourth quarter at $5.7 billion after two consecutive quarters of decline from $6.5 billion in the year's first quarter. The area logged a large share of early-stage deals as a proportion of overall deals for the full year.</p><p>Atlanta saw venture funding drop three consecutive quarters last year—from roughly $1.6 billion in the first quarter to $514 million in the fourth. However, the area notched a record 74 deals in the final quarter, up from 54 in the first.</p><p>Denver broke its previous quarterly funding record last year after startups based there netted roughly $2.3 billion in capital in the fourth quarter, a 64% increase from its previous record set in the second quarter.</p><p>And now on to the news ...</p><p>Top News</p><p>AI interview. Databricks Ventures, launched in December by Databricks Inc., aims to invest in young companies developing data and artificial-intelligence systems that work with its parent's Databricks Lakehouse data repository and analytics platform.</p><p>Andrew Ferguson, head of the new venture arm, is leading the strategic investment effort. Early this month, Databricks Ventures made its first investment, joining in a $110 million Series D funding round of Labelbox Inc., a training data platform for enterprise machine-learning applications.</p><p>Mr. Ferguson talked with WSJ Pro about the Lakehouse Fund, the unit's first, and the effort to identify startups that can contribute to Databricks' \"lakehouse\" ecosystem. In the past, more common data repositories required companies to make copies of their data so that it could be structured and analyzed in a separate environment. A lakehouse allows users to analyze data in the repository itself, according to Databricks, a startup valued at $38 billion.</p><p>Click here to read edited excerpts from the interview.</p><p>8.1%</p><p>China's GDP growth in 2021, though momentum slowed in the fourth quarter.

The deal is expected to close in early February, the people said. Warburg acquired the Downers Grove, Ill.-based Duravant in 2017 and agreed to sell a portion of its majority stake to Carlyle in October last year. It didn't disclose the terms of the deal, but the transaction valued Duravant, which provides engineered equipment and automated solutions to various industries including food processing, at about $5.5 billion, a source familiar with the transaction said.</p><p>Meet the Investor Who Spots Opportunities for Jeffrey Katzenberg</p><p>When he was growing up in Los Angeles, Anthony Saleh said he found entrepreneurial inspiration in the VHS cassettes of Walt Disney Co. classics such as \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Aladdin.\" After receiving the tapes for his birthday, he would rent them out to friends for 25 cents a night. At the time, Mr. Saleh gave no thought to the company behind those movies, or the executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg, then largely responsible for their production throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Yet more than 25 years later, it is Mr. Saleh whom Mr. Katzenberg is turning to for help plotting a course out of the rubble formed when his first post-Hollywood venture, Quibi, imploded, The Wall Street Journal's Erich Schwartzel reports. Mr. Saleh, 35 years old, has been Mr. Katzenberg's point of entry to the early-stage technology companies the mogul is evaluating far outside the Hollywood bubble, both men said.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Human Capital is raising $500 million for its fifth fund, according to a regulatory filing.
