  "title": "AT&T to Slice Dividend After Spinoff of WarnerMedia; Shareholders will get 0.24 shares in new media company and reduced annual dividend of $1.11 a share",
  "text": "<p>After the spinoff, AT&amp;T said it expects to pay an annual per-share dividend of about $1.11, down from its most recent $2.08 level. The new payout would cost the company just under $8 billion a year, down from the roughly $15 billion it paid out in 2021.</p><p>AT&amp;T is one of the most widely held U.S. stocks, and the company has historically offered one of the largest regular dividend payouts on the market. Based on Monday's closing price, it had an 8.16% dividend yield. By comparison, rival Verizon Communications Inc. had a dividend yield of 4.81% based on Monday's prices.</p><p>Shares of AT&amp;T fell roughly 6% in early trading Tuesday to around $24. The stock has lost about a third of its value since AT&amp;T agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. in October 2016, while the S&amp;P 500 index has doubled in the same period.</p><p>AT&amp;T said the change accounts for the media-asset distribution and supports the telecom company's plans to boost investment in 5G wireless and fiber-optic service. Reducing the size of the dividend will also allow the business to more quickly whittle down debt.</p><p>AT&amp;T executives had said they would cut the dividend to reflect the company's smaller size once the media business is carved out into a separate company. The stand-alone telecom company stands to get about $43 billion in cash from the transaction, subject to certain adjustments.</p><p>AT&amp;T in May agreed to shed its media business after struggling to convince investors that a telecom-and-media giant would be worth more than the sum of its parts. After an antitrust fight, the Dallas company completed its purchase of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studios in 2018.</p><p>Company leaders have since said that hiving off the media unit and merging it with smaller rival Discovery will give the stand-alone entertainment company even more heft to battle Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co. and big tech companies racing to capture the streaming video market. WarnerMedia's HBO unit reported 73.8 million world-wide streaming subscribers at the end of 2021.</p><p>AT&amp;T has spent the past year reassuring shareholders that the remaining business will keep growing while paying a smaller dividend that reflects its diminished size. Existing shareholders are in line to get a roughly 71% stake in the entertainment company, which will be called Warner Bros. Discovery.</p><p>The company said Tuesday that the new media business will trade under the stock ticker \"WBD.\" Executives have said that the spinoff will focus on growth and won't pay a regular dividend.</p><p>AT&amp;T Chief Executive John Stankey last week said that the company was debating the best way to separate the two businesses. He said during a conference call with analysts that splitting the shareholder base through an exchange offer would help lower the number of AT&amp;T shares circulating—boosting its stock price—though such a complex move would be unprecedented for a company of its size.</p><p>The telecom chief said the company wanted to keep in mind its large base of individual shareholders who might not \"go as deep on the puts and takes and ins and outs of things as the institutional base does.\" The company's investor base has a large share of retirees and other individuals with small holdings, a legacy of its roots as a blue-chip company descended from the original nationwide Bell monopoly.</p><p>\"We need to make sure it's transparent and clean for everybody involved in this,\" Mr. Stankey said last week.</p><p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com</p><p>AT&amp;T to Slice Dividend After Spinoff of WarnerMedia</p>",
