  "title": "Does FTX's New CEO Have the Worst Job in Corporate America? John J. Ray III was known for his work on Enron's bankruptcy. Then he took over the mess at FTX. 'I am drawn to crisis,' he says.",
  "text": "<p>The same person who became CEO of Enron under similar circumstances of chaos and panic is now a central figure in another generational business scandal because of the market for his talents: Mr. Ray is in high demand when something, somewhere has gone horribly wrong.</p><p>His work depends on colossal failure in which unfathomable amounts of money have gone missing. His success will be measured by how much he can find and how quickly he can find it.</p><p>more science of success</p><p>* A Psychologist Spent Five Years Studying World Cup Penalty Shootouts</p><p>* Bob Iger Is Back at Disney to Fix His One Big Failure</p><p>* 85,000 Ukrainians Fled to the U.S., and Twice as Many Americans Offered to Help</p><p>* The Risky Business of Sam Bankman-Fried</p><p>Anyone drawn to crisis would have felt the gravitational pull of FTX's catastrophic implosion from another galaxy. The cryptocurrency exchange is bankrupt and owes billions of dollars to what could be millions of creditors. Only someone like Mr. Ray could have been so eager for the job. \"I love jumping into the breach,\" he said.</p><p>Others start companies. He salvages whatever is left of them. That is the difference between Mr. Ray and the people he tends to replace. They promise disruption. He restores order. It's a role that goes overlooked even in situations when people can't look away.</p><p>That was especially true during the latest drama in the FTX saga. Sam Bankman-Fried, the company's disgraced former CEO, was arrested in the Bahamas this week and charged by U.S. criminal prosecutors for stealing customer money in what they called \"one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.\" He was also sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, denied bail and remanded to jail on the same day.</p><p>But as Mr. Bankman-Fried was in Bahamian custody, Mr. Ray was testifying before Congress in Washington. The previously inconspicuous CEO presented himself as the opposite of his ubiquitous predecessor. In his first public appearance, he was brief, direct and under oath.</p><p>He also wore pants. He seemed to believe in haircuts. He looked like the adult in the room.</p><p>He's not in the habit of blabbing about FTX, but it turned out Mr. Ray had a lot to say when legally required. His first-day bankruptcy declaration weeks earlier made the Declaration of Independence sound ambivalent.</p><p>\"I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience,\" he said. \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.\"</p><p>Mr. Ray says that \"the art of making complex things simple\" is a key part of his work. This scathing portrayal of a dysfunctional company that duped the world happened to be a perfect example.</p><p>It framed the calamity in terms anyone could understand: The guy who took over Enron was saying the FTX disaster was worse than Enron.</p><p>\"This situation,\" he said, \"is unprecedented.\"</p><p>He would know. Mr. Ray has overseen the unwinding of the knottiest bankruptcies in business history, most notably the five years he spent picking through the wreckage of Enron and finding more than $20 billion. The original expectation was that he might recover around 17 cents on the dollar for creditors. Mr. Ray has said the final number was roughly 52 cents. That accomplishment is both encouraging and demoralizing for people who lost money to FTX.</p><p>\"He'll at least minimize the pain,\" said Nancy Rapoport, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor who has studied the Enron case. \"But there will still be pain.\"</p><p>When I asked people around Mr. Ray why he is good at his job, they offered two reasons that explain a lot of professional success: He's been doing it for a long time, and he actually likes doing it.</p><p>The son of a plumber, Mr. Ray was once a lawyer at Waste Management, and he built a career on cleaning up spectacular messes.</p><p>He found his niche almost by accident. After growing up in Pittsfield, Mass., and going to Drake University in Iowa for law school, he worked for a Chicago firm and became general counsel at Fruit of the Loom in the 1990s, unexpectedly steering the company through his first major bankruptcy. It was excellent preparation for a career plumbing the depths of management rot. He started his own specialized bankruptcy firm in 2002, which he called Avidity Partners, and the back of his business cards included a definition for \"avidity,\" according to the Chicago Tribune. Mr. Ray wanted clients to know that it meant \"characterized by enthusiasm and vigorous pursuit.\"</p><p>Few people were as qualified to handle the FTX debacle. The 63-year-old bankruptcy guru was not a crypto guy, and yet Mr. Ray wasn't an underwear guy at Fruit of the Loom, just as he wasn't an energy guy before Enron or a telecom guy before Nortel Networks. He didn't have to be. His experience with dozens of large bankruptcy cases bred his expertise.</p><p>\"Once you've gone through a few of these, you really begin to understand how they work,\" said Jim Bromley, a Sullivan &amp; Cromwell partner on the legal team representing FTX.</p><p>Anyone who has been around corporate bankruptcy knows it's odd for someone to be genuinely absorbed by corporate bankruptcy. But obsession is an edge in every business. The less others care about the job, the more it's a competitive advantage.</p><p>Mr. Ray fishes, golfs, hunts birds and smokes a tasty brisket. But his work maximizing value and mitigating damage \"is why he gets up in the morning,\" said Jared Ellias, a Harvard Law School professor.</p><p>Mr. Ray, who is billing $1,300 an hour, was hired by FTX's legal advisers soon after the collapse for the greatest challenge of his career. A crypto bankruptcy case was always going to be difficult because of the global nature of the unregulated business. But appalled by the company's lack of records and documentation, Mr. Ray said this was a \"paperless bankruptcy,\" neatly summarizing the fiasco as \"plain old embezzlement.\" He has also described his predecessor not as a visionary, savior or the modern John Pierpont Morgan but \"inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised.\"</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried was equally critical of his successor in his prepared congressional testimony. \"I am not optimistic,\" he wrote. \"I have not myself witnessed any progress by Mr. Ray's team towards raising substantial funds or restarting the exchange.\" He was arrested before he could appear at the hearing.</p><p>The new CEO of FTX has been traveling around Texas, Delaware and Washington, not the Bahamas, and Mr. Ray's team consists of lawyers, accountants, consultants, investigators and crypto analysts. They meet at 9:30 a.m. and 6 p.m., initially seven days a week and now five with a weekend update, as they track down assets and try to figure out what happened. Mr. Ray's staff is implementing the governance structures and basic oversight systems that were foreign concepts under Mr. Bankman-Fried. The unglamorous process will almost certainly take years.</p><p>The only part he appreciates more than the uncertain beginning of a bankruptcy is the end.</p><p>\"Nothing feels more satisfying than coming out the other side of the storm united with those who fought by your side,\" Mr. Ray said. \"It is the ultimate human bonding experience.\"</p><p>Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com</p><p>Does FTX's New CEO Have the Worst Job in Corporate America?</p>",
