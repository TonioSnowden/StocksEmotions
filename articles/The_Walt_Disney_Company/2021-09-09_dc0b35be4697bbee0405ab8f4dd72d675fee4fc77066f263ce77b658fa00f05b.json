  "text": "<p>The employers will also have to give workers paid time off to get vaccinated or to recover from any side effects of getting vaccinated.</p><p>The new requirement, set to be announced by Mr. Biden in a speech Thursday, is part of a six-point initiative to boost vaccinations, improve access to testing and make Covid-19 treatments more widely available. The heightened push to combat the pandemic comes amid a surge in infections and increase in hospitalizations and deaths.</p><p>The president will also say the administration plans to require vaccinations for workers in most healthcare settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. The mandate applies to about 50,000 health providers, officials said.</p><p>The president will also require federal employees in the executive branch and government contractors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, stepping up the requirements for these workers after Mr. Biden earlier said federal workers and contractors who work on-site must be vaccinated or face regular testing and other measures.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How should the administration combat the Delta variant? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The new mandates will cover about 100 million workers, or two-thirds of all workers in the U.S., officials said.</p><p>Some Republicans have criticized vaccine mandates. Labor unions' views on vaccination requirements have been mixed. Some have said requirements should be part of contract negotiations, like other work rules. Tyson Foods Inc. reached a deal with its largest labor union. Other unions, such as the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and American Federation of Teachers, have been more supportive and are encouraging members to get vaccinated.</p><p>Companies including United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Tyson are requiring all employees to be vaccinated. Others, such as Walmart Inc., McDonald's Corp. and Walt Disney Co. , have said certain groups, such as managers or white-collar workers, need to take the shot. Many hospital groups and colleges and universities have also moved to require vaccinations.</p><p>Eric Morath contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Sabrina Siddiqui at Sabrina.Siddiqui@wsj.com</p><p>Biden to Tell Large Employers to Mandate Vaccines or Require Weekly Testing in New Plan to Combat Covid-19 Pandemic</p>",
