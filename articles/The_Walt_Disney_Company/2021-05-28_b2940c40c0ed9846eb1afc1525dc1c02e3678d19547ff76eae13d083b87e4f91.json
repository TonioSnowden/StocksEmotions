  "title": "Cynthia Erivo and Suzan-Lori Parks on the alchemy of Aretha Franklin",
  "text": "<p>Cynthia Erivo, star of <em>Genius: Aretha</em>, a new eight-part biographical series on the American singer Aretha Franklin, clearly recalls the first time she heard The Voice. “I was nine or 10 years old, in the car with my mother who was taking me to school, and “Think” [Franklin's barnstorming 1968 single] came on. I said, ‘Who is this?', and she said ‘It's Aretha Franklin', and I thought, ‘My God, she is amazing!'”</p> <p>Childhood wonderment on the streets of south London soon grew into a “complete obsession” for Erivo, whose own vocal prowess would help earn her a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Another song on the car radio, Franklin's 1985 duet with Annie Lennox, “Sisters Are Doin' it for Themselves”, prompted another epiphany. “My mind was blown. I couldn't compute how this one person was able to do these two types of music, and both of them could connect with me so vividly.”</p> <p>Those inspirational moments have served Erivo well: at 34 she already has a Grammy, a Tony, and an Emmy to her name, as well as two Oscar nominations (Best Actress and Best Original Song) for 2019's <em>Harriet</em>, a biopic about the abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Further acclaim is certain to follow for her latest, finely nuanced, interpretation of a woman who was forced to surmount a turbulent upbringing to become a giant of American popular culture.</p> <p>Franklin's childhood was dominated by her father C L Franklin, a Baptist minister and celebrity preacher, who took her on the road with him on his “gospel caravan” tours when she was 12. By the age of 15, she had already released an album of gospel songs, and had borne two children. The series, punctuated by unflinching flashbacks, shows the lasting effects of those early years, but also Franklin's defiance and determination to shape her own art.</p> <p>Erivo's Aretha is headstrong, certain of her own talent, yet also occasionally brittle. “There is a vulnerability there, but she wasn't an insecure person,” she tells me during a Zoom call from Los Angeles. “A little bit of hesitation, and slightly lost sometimes.</p> <p>“I felt there was something very subtle, a kind of mystique, about her. I do think it took her some time to find her own space in music. She had one of those voices that really could do everything. But it wasn't until she found what she could connect to in her heart that anything started to land.”</p> <p>Not the least of Erivo's challenges was recreating The Voice, crisply described by one of the characters as simultaneously “funky and celestial”. “I had a lot of beautiful support from my vocal coach,” says Erivo. “Each of our sessions would last for one or two hours, listening to a couple of songs, working through them one by one, learning about the details she would put into [them].”</p> <p>She gives me an impromptu demonstration, a 10-second extract from Elton John's “Border Song”, which appeared on Franklin's 1972 album <em>Young, Gifted and Black, </em>and which nearly blasts the laptop off my desk. “There are throwaway notes in it, dips in it, volume — she is her own phraser,” Erivo explains, as if describing the aftertaste of a fine wine. “We have different instruments, but it was about trying to find the technical tricks she would use, to get as close to the song that we all know and love.”</p> <p>The series opens in the mid-1960s, when the 24-year-old Franklin moves to Muscle Shoals in Alabama, under the guidance of Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler (played by David Cross). It was in these sessions that she brought together her gospel roots, and the soul sound that was beginning to achieve chart success.</p> <p>The series' showrunner, Suzan-Lori Parks, says the move was crucial in developing Franklin's sound. “Just think, in 1967, a black woman decides to go to Alabama to make a record. That is so daring, and brave. It felt like her last chance to make a hit.”</p> <p>“There was a very racist vibe down there, but she made great soul music with these white musicians she didn't even know before she met them,” adds Parks. “She knew she wanted to make a significant impact on the culture. [Before the move] her sound wasn't a sound that could make [that] impact, she could feel that. But she kept working until she found it.”</p> <p>Parks, who won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2002 for her play <em>Topdog/Underdog</em>, says Franklin's relationship with Martin Luther King Jr (played by Ethan Henry) marked another change of direction for her music. Their scenes together have an almost flirtatious quality to them, I say.</p> <p>“No, no. They were just admiring each other. Here you have these two passionate, black geniuses, icons of American culture, who have struggled, found their calling and answered their call. They are having a moment, enjoying each other's company. Franklin was historically a great supporter of Dr King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She donated her time and supported them financially.”</p> <p>The episodes covering the civil rights years were “in the can before last summer's [Black Lives Matter] uprisings”, Parks says. “Not because I wanted people to go away and say, ‘Gee, nothing has changed.' A lot has changed. In America, and in the world. And still, we need to go forward, to look at and examine our actions every day.”</p> <p>With the impending arrival in the coming months of a new movie biopic, <em>Respect</em>, starring Jennifer Hudson, it seems the US is having an Aretha moment, following the singer's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8d3aa0e-9ee3-11e8-b196-da9d6c239ca8\">death in 2018</a>. Could Parks have imagined the series being made 10 years ago? “Well, it <em>could</em> have,” she says sceptically, and then answers the question more elliptically. “Years ago, they were making <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcd24f16-2622-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025\"><em>Genius: Einstein</em></a> and <em>Genius: Picasso</em>, [the first two series in the cycle]. They weren't making <em>Genius: Aretha</em>.” (The subject of the fourth series will be Martin Luther King Jr.)</p> <p>Franklin had been in touch with Parks during her final years. “She wanted me to write a stage musical of her life. She was thinking about her biography, and how her life would be shown.”</p> <p>With the prominence of religion and the civil rights movement in her life, and her troublesome family relations, Franklin seemed to represent a kind of melting pot for American life, I say. “She alchemised her difficulties into solid gold. She took all the difficulties of her life, and the culture, and created this songbook from which, even now, after she has passed, we can turn on a song and feel strength from it, and feel solace from it. And also the complexity of American life.</p> <p>“Maybe that is why she is the Queen of Soul.”</p> <p><em>‘Genius: Aretha' will be available on Disney Plus in the UK from June 4 and is on National Geographic in the US now</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Peter Aspden 2021 'Cynthia Erivo and Suzan-Lori Parks on the alchemy of Aretha Franklin' FT.com 28 May.
