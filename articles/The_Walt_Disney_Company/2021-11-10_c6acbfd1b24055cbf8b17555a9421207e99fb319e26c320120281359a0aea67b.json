  "text": "<p>( Apple TV+)</p><p>Will Ferrell says that the only sad part about making \"The Shrink Next Door\" with Paul Rudd was the realization that it took them so long to find something new to partner on.</p><p>\"Man,\" says Mr. Rudd, who has starred with Mr. Ferrell in films like \"Anchorman,\" and \"Anchorman 2.\" \"I feel the exact same way.\"</p><p>\"The Shrink Next Door\" stars Mr. Rudd as a Dr. Ike Herschkopf, a psychiatrist who manipulated one of his patients (Mr. Ferrell's Marty Markowitz) for decades, gaining access to his money, property and ultimately isolating him from his family. The series, which debuts Friday on Apple TV+, is based on the hit true-crime podcast of the same name hosted by Joe Nocera.</p><p>Across a pair of joint interviews, the stars said there was never a big conversation to hash out who was going to play whom. Mr. Rudd said he could tell Mr. Ferrell was going to be able to inhabit both the sweetness and woundedness of Mr. Markowitz.</p><p>\"We'd be in a therapy session saying our lines,\" he says, \"but I would look into his face and he would break my heart.\"</p><p>Mr. Ferrell said he thought Mr. Rudd was perfect for Dr. Ike, as his character calls him, because he had the acting chops to be \"charismatic enough to reel me in\" and \"nuanced enough to change gears and get me to do the things he wanted me to do without me knowing it.\"</p><p>\"That is such a nice answer,\" Mr. Rudd responded, \"and totally different than what I thought you were going to say.\"</p><p>Asked what he thought Mr. Ferrell was going to say, Mr. Rudd laughed and said: \"Uh, the clothes fit too well.\"</p><p>Trending: 'The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill'</p><p>(Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.)</p><p>Facing accusations of bullying and domineering behavior, Mark Driscoll abruptly resigned from Seattle's Mars Hill Church in 2014, setting off a quick implosion of the megachurch that he was the very-public face of. Christianity Today uses the church's history as a jumping off point to tell a broader story about the evangelical community in a narrative podcast called \"The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill,\" which has been a hit, reaching the top 10 on the Apple Podcasts Charts.</p><p>The podcast connects Mars Hill Church to what host Mike Cosper says is a national trend over the past 30 years: churches run by \"charismatic figures whose character doesn't align with their gifts\" and who foster a toxic culture that has papered over by their success.</p><p>\"Where it's a break from a lot of celebrity pastor scandals in the past is that the issues weren't addiction, an affair or money,\" Mr. Cosper said in an interview. \"It was simply bullying, domineering–mismanagement, even, in some ways.\"</p><p>The podcast also explores Mr. Driscoll's teachings. It includes audio of Mr. Driscoll preaching about sex, for example, and says he pushed ideas that encouraged women to be submissive and engage in certain sexual acts that their husbands might desire, such as stripping, but which they might not.</p><p>An assistant to Mr. Driscoll said in a statement that he and his wife, Grace Driscoll, called that interpretation of the pastor's messages about sex to be \"flatly untrue\" and said they \"believe, live, and teach the opposite of these lies.\" They declined to comment on Mr. Cosper's characterizations of his behavior.</p><p>Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor at Calvin University, a Christian university, and the author of the 2020 book \"Jesus and John Wayne,\" says \"Mars Hill\" arrives as many evangelicals have been reconsidering long-held beliefs and teachings—including those popularized by pastors such as Mr. Driscoll. \"It just connects with their own personal experiences,\" says Ms. Du Mez, who was interviewed for the podcast, \"at a time when they are ready to reassess their religious and cultural formation.\"</p><p>New Release: 'Mayor of Kingstown'</p><p>(Paramount +)</p><p>\"Mayor of Kingstown,\" a new drama that premieres Sunday on the Paramount+ streaming service, is about a pair of power-broker brothers in Kingstown, Mich., where the major industry is private prisons—and the drugs, smuggling and gangland commerce that bleeds between their walls. Mike McLusky (Jeremy Renner) and Mitch McLusky (Kyle Chandler) pull strings and arrange deals with inmates, gang members and other interests that influence Kingstown life on both sides of the prison walls.</p><p>Dianne Wiest plays the mother of the power brokers and a third brother, a police officer. Ms. Wiest, who won Academy Awards for her performances in the Woody Allen films \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"Bullets Over Broadway,\" says she has actually been trying to avoid motherhood roles in recent years.</p><p>\"I don't want to do domestic mothering stuff anymore,\" she says. \"Somehow, for whatever reason—I'm still uncertain why—I became the mother and nothing else. And, wow, is that not interesting.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The role of Mariam McLusky, she says, is different. She's a mother only in the sense that women of her age often are mothers. But here, she's a hardened teacher in Kingstown women's prison with no interest in or patience for the way her power-broking sons run their lives and business.</p><p>\"The less I have to do with this family,\" she says of her character, \"the better off I am.\"</p><p>Streaming Notes:</p><p>• \"Home Sweet Home Alone,\" a reboot of the beloved Christmas franchise features a new family and a new abandoned child. But, yes, there is at least one McCallister sighting in the film. The film begins streaming Friday on Disney+.</p><p>• \"Yellowjackets,\" Showtime's new drama is about the survivors of a high school soccer team whose plane crashed in the wilderness, the women the players become 25 years later, and what really happened in the woods before they were rescued. The series premieres Sunday on Showtime and the Showtime app.</p><p>• \"Red Notice,\" an action caper that begins streaming Friday on Netflix, stars Dwayne Johnson as an FBI agent who teams up with an art thief played by Ryan Reynolds, to catch \"The Bishop,\" an even more wanted art thief played by Gal Gadot.</p><p>What to Watch: Six Shows and Movies to Stream</p>",
