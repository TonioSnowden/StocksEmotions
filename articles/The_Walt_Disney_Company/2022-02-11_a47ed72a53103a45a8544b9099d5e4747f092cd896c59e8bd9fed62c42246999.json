  "title": "Arts in Review -- Film Review:  'Nile': Low-Flow Hercule Poirot  ---  The latest version of Agatha Christie's thriller about a fateful Egyptian cruise founders on the shoals of seriousness  ----  By Joe Morgenstern",
  "text": "<p>   The best to be said about \"Death on the Nile,\" playing in theaters and set mostly aboard an Egyptian paddle-wheel vacation steamer shortly before World War II, is that it passes time painlessly -- for us, not for the vacationers, most of whom become murder suspects with ample motives. Yet pleasure eludes the production's grasp. Disney's take on Agatha Christie's 1937 novel, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, has pizazz and period style in the same way today's big-brand toothpastes have flavor -- artificial ingredients give them a taste that's discernible, but too generic to name. </p><p>   The best-known screen version of the story, made in 1978, played the book for grins, and occasionally wholehearted laughs: Peter Ustinov's Hercule Poirot, Christie's Belgian detective, was delightfully fatuous in his enchantment with his own intellect. But Mr. Branagh makes Poirot terribly serious, as he did in the same role in the 2017 remake of \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" (He directed both films from screenplays by Michael Green.) \"He's a bloodhound,\" someone says of Poirot. \"Let him sniff.\" Bloodhounds may look funny -- this one certainly does, with his four-twirler mustache plus soul patch -- but they don't behave in funny ways, and that's a deficit in a drama that needs all the leavening of humor it can get. </p><p>   Poirot's mustache is the subject of an elaborate black-and-white preface that explains why he wears it. The sequence is emphatically unfunny -- set in the trenches of World War I, it looks like the preface to a remake of \"Paths of Glory\" -- and eerily out of scale; its only purpose is shining a sympathetic light on the detective before he turns downright maudlin in the course of subsequent events. And speaking of light, this \"Death on the Nile\" was shot by an excellent cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukos -- he did the beautiful black-and-white photography in Mr. Branagh's \"Belfast\" -- but the color palette here skews so sharply toward the sunburned nostalgia of yellows and reds that it has the bizarre effect of making every member of the already diverse cast look like a person of color. </p><p>   The 1978 version could hardly be called a triumph -- John Guillermin's direction was no more than workmanlike, and Lois Chiles seemed to go about in a trance state as a rich heiress at the center of the action. But the movie was released at a time when audiences still turned out to see a collection of stars and familiar character actors do their stuff, however silly it might have been. And they were amply rewarded -- not only by Ustinov, who was the movie's animating spirit, but by Angela Lansbury's hilarious portrayal of a boozy romance novelist named Salome Otterbourne; by Maggie Smith as a spinster nurse-companion; and by a supporting cast that included Bette Davis, David Niven, Mia Farrow and George Kennedy. </p><p>   No such rewards are bestowed this time. Set pieces are staged and shot for superficial impact -- myriad white balloons at a shipboard gala; drums whomping sententiously during a spasmodic chase. Even the ship's anchor plunging to the riverbed warrants a close-up and a stentorian thump. (At one point a Nile crocodile pops up out of the water in a corner of the screen and gulps down several shore birds. It's actually pretty funny.) Salome has become a blues singer. That's a good thing, for Sophie Okonedo brings verve and irony to the role, and everything comes briefly to life whenever Salome belts out another song. The cast includes Gal Gadot, Tom Bateman, Annette Bening, Russell Brand and Letitia Wright. Nothing particularly good or bad flows from their efforts, but that's less than one can say about Armie Hammer, who is actively, almost mysteriously dreadful in the role of the rich heiress's new husband. Like Poirot's mustache, the movie as a whole is a waxworks. </p><p></p>",
