  "text": "<p>“Surprise!” A bruised, middle-aged face beams on a doorstep to begin <em>Red Rocket</em>, a dervish new comedy-drama about washed-up porn stardom. The venue is Texas City, a US oil town of less grandeur than the name implies. The smile belongs to Mikey Davies (Simon Rex), back where he grew up after years in Los Angeles and the adult film industry. Later, to save time explaining, he advises people simply to google his working name: Mikey Saber. Their search histories are not his problem. </p> <p>The weed-ridden bungalow which he pleads to be let into is rented by his estranged wife, Lexi (Bree Elrod), and her lightly fried mother, Lil (Brenda Deiss). Many bad times have clearly passed between the former couple. Mikey turns hopefully to Lexi's bulldog. “He's a good man,” he ventriloquises. “I can tell by his nice energy.”</p> <p>There are other, better words for Mikey's energy. Some seem indivisible from those of lead actor Rex, a fast-talking performer, now 47, with his own chequered history on the margins of American culture. (His career to date involves spells on MTV and in the <em>Scary Movie</em> franchise as well as his own brief stint in adult video.) Here, he is magnetically frantic, giving Mikey just enough charm that Lexi and Lil crack and offer him the couch. A new leaf is promised; a regular job sought. Consider this the morning after the boogie nights before.</p> <p>The sitcomy first act promises a sweet satire of domestic redemption. Don't bank on it. The mood remains scratchy. The film takes place in 2016; snippets of Trump and Clinton drift by. And material bleakness is all around. For director Sean Baker, the movie is the latest of a number set in an America that has fallen through the cracks. (His last, 2017's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40013d92-c491-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675\"><em>The Florida Project</em></a>, was a glorious snapshot of the ragged motels around Walt Disney World.) Now, in this scuffed corner of Texas City, few ways of getting by are legal and fewer still are dignified. Baker is empathetic, but Mikey eyes the exit again, and whatever or whoever he has to do to get there.</p> <p>The story flips in the space of a scene. In a local doughnut shop, a sparky young woman by the name of Strawberry stands bored behind the counter. We get another close-up of Mikey's reptilian face. His expression might register as lust — dubious enough, given the character is 17. The truth is queasier still. Mikey doesn't just spy a conquest, he sees a future porn star, and his ticket back to LA. Yet the film takes pains to nuance the seduction ahead. Strawberry (played by Suzanna Son, another gifted Baker discovery, actually in her twenties) is savvy and insightful, nobody's fool. She is <em>also</em> still a teenager being groomed by a vampiric older man who we learn would sell his soul and yours for an adult movie “AVN” award. “Like the Academy Awards for what I do,” he gushes.</p> <p>There is a small irony that <em>Red Rocket</em>'s distributor A24 evidently saw it as an Oscar hopeful — the AVNs for what they do. The task the film sets itself is difficult and delicate, giving the audience a frank, multi-sided account of sex work, male predation and female agency, all from within a movie whose slapstick can call to mind <em>Mr Bean</em>. Baker makes it work not always but mostly. (For what it's worth, his creative team includes several female producers.) </p> <p>Any film that trusts you with your own moral compass is welcome. And, Lord knows, the light it shines on Mikey's inner ugly is bright indeed. Can we call that a catch-22? The use of the 2016 election is subtle. Baker might be gesturing to Donald Trump with Rex's manic narcissist, but if he is, he does so gracefully. Still, Trump did always argue that the press used him to sell papers even while reviling him. He had a point. The dynamic finds an echo in <em>Red Rocket</em>, a kinetic, funny film that owes it all to the snake it makes you wish you had never set eyes on.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>In UK cinemas from March 11</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'Red Rocket — ageing porn star story is funny but a queasy watch' FT.com 10 March.
