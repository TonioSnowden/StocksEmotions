  "text": "<p>Thirty feet above the forest floor, on a deck surrounded by the branches of a 200-year-old oak, I soak in a giant enamelled bath. Down below, a pheasant bustles through the undergrowth; beside me, the sauna quietly ticks, warming my bathrobe. I am in a tree and, as a blue tit lands on a nearby branch and eyes me dispassionately, and moths putter by, unperturbed by my presence, I feel I am of the tree, too. I seem to be having a spiritual experience in a hot tub.</p> <p>If the Woodsman's Treehouse were a ship — and there is something nautical about the building, sailing through the forest, using the same sturdy materials that once carried British seamen to every corner of the globe — then this upper deck, reached by a spiral staircase, would be the eagle's nest. Below is the main heart of this dazzling, playful building, which has been garlanded with architectural awards since it opened in a patch of Dorset woodland five years ago.</p> <p>A circular room lined in elegant arrangements of cedar and Douglas fir gives on to a neat, well-equipped kitchen and calm, minimalist bedroom; in another niche, a copper bath is framed by a huge picture window that looks out on to a tangle of birch, alder and willow trees. It offers a <em>Swiss Family Robinson</em> promise of self-sufficient living and a Heath Robinson sense of fun: there are pulleys and portholes and you can enter and exit the treehouse via a slide. And above all, it is a hymn to the beauty of wood, from stacks of sweet chestnut logs to hand-hewn oak shingles and laths. It feels almost alive, creaking and stretching in the morning as the sun heats it up.</p> <p>Its creator, Guy Mallinson, might be the only person on Earth not to find it a relaxing place to stay. “All I see is jobs that need to be done,” says the 57-year-old, a gentle, jovial figure whose mastery of woodworking has been acquired over four decades. And yet the peculiar magic of the treehouse has gripped him enough that, just before Covid-19 struck, he set to work on building two more. As it turns out, his timing is immaculate: he will open these self-contained, luxurious sanctuaries just in time to benefit from a boom in domestic tourism, as a frazzled population seeks refuge in nature. “It's not a marketing strategy I'd ever planned,” he says. “But everyone's searching for a treehouse and a hot tub.”</p> <p>A note to the purists: these treehouses may not, technically, be treehouses. “The whole definition of a treehouse is a difficult thing, because if you imagine a childhood picture of one, it's a building, supported by a tree, up in the tree,” says Mallinson. “It's not something you can do on this scale. Each tree has grown in response to its environment to be as efficient as it can, and to suddenly stick 40 tonnes of building on it is a no-no, as far as I'm concerned. Similarly, roots are a big issue. If you damage the roots of a big tree, it's very bad news.”</p> <p>These treehouses are supported by steel poles driven deep into the ground, neatly avoiding the tree roots, and then attached to hefty wooden stilts that hold up the floors: the engineering was figured out by Keith Brownlie, Mallinson's co-conspirator and the architect behind the winking Gateshead Millennium Bridge. But by dint of some clever positioning amid the trunks and branches, a fundamentally treehouse-like quality remains in all three: a sense of freedom and faunish fellow-feeling with the forest itself.</p> <p>“You feel like you're up a tree, but you're not actually stressing the tree in any way,” says Mallinson. “There's an amazing ecosystem around these oak trees, with little bugs and things going up and down the trunks, and if you start interrupting that, it completely changes the whole thing. We're absolutely confident that we've trod as lightly as we can in this sort of environment, because it would be a shame not to.”</p> <p>The first of the new treehouses to open will be <a href=\"https://mallinson.co.uk/dazzle/\">Dazzle</a>, named for the geometric camouflage used to disguise battleships during the first world war, a version of which adorns the treehouse's external walls. The interior is fitted out in oak, birch ply, Douglas fir, with dizzyingly precise craftsmanship on display in every room.</p> <p>On the deck is the much googled-for hot tub, as well as a pizza oven and barbecue (which feature in all three treehouses). There's no slide here, but you can recline on a latticed cargo net built into the floor of the deck, “made by the people who make fall arrest systems for building sites”, Mallinson explains reassuringly. At <a href=\"https://mallinson.co.uk/Pinwheel/\">Pinwheel</a>, which was still under construction during my visit, and is scheduled to open at the end of August, there's a swing on the deck — “you've got to get your inner child thing somewhere,” says Mallinson.</p> <p>Treehouses do carry a little charge of danger, a memory of skinned knees and dubious parental DIY. Mallinson's trio are of a different order, built to the same building regulations as a domestic dwelling, but there are still fire extinguishers within hand's reach almost everywhere, in case the alfresco cooking gets out of hand. “We design on the basis that someone is stupid, pissed, and stoned,” says Mallinson. “That seems to work.” Children, meanwhile, are banned. “We got to a stage where the safety officer was saying we had to put cages around the fires and fencing around the ditches and the pond, and we thought — this isn't practical. Also, I love kids, but we discovered that if you've got a honeymooning couple and a crying baby next door, neither is happy.”</p> <p>Mallinson began his career as a maker at the age of eight, commandeering the garage at his family home in London. After stints at the School for Craftsmen in Wood (established by British furniture designer John Makepeace) and the Royal College of Art, Mallinson set up a workshop in Fulham “designing and making weird and wonderful things that no one else would touch”: a 200m handrail for the Trinity Laban dance conservatoire in Deptford, a refit of Disney's UK headquarters that involved piecing together a marquetry recreation of Disney's castle. The treehouses have that same mad ambition — Dazzle is filled with meticulous geometry, the bathroom in particular a masterpiece of trompe l'oeil marquetry — but you can feel the reassuring presence of the human hand and eye in all of them.</p> <p>Even as the turnover got greater and the commissions grander (including working for Qatar's ruling al-Thani family) the business was precarious. “Every now and again, a job would go wrong and you'd lose everything from the year. Either you'd misquote or a contractor would go bust, or something like that. So we were working ourselves stupid and doing quite well, but we never made any money out of it.”</p> <p>With three sons “bouncing off the walls” in London, Mallinson and his wife made the decision to move to this spot among the rolling Dorset hedgerows, about 25 minutes north of the ammonite-strewn beaches of Lyme Regis. The first incarnation of the site was as “Crafty Camping”: Mallinson taught green woodworking — using unseasoned wood to make spoons, bowls, chairs, “a very nice, earthy sort of craft” — and offered glamping in yurts, a tepee, a shepherd's hut and a bell tent.</p> <p>These are still standing and offer a more rustic (and cheaper) counterpoint to the treehouses. They used to have shared facilities, but Mallinson has phased those out during the pandemic. “That's actually something I wanted to do anyway and people prefer it. Because not everyone — myself included — wants to chat to a whole bunch of strangers when they're making a cup of tea first thing in the morning.”</p> <p>For three days, then, my wife and I enjoy the magnificent seclusion. Once we have entered the wood, it feels as if a door has shut behind us. We venture out to the excellent nearby farmer's markets and pubs to pick up supplies, but soon retreat back. At night, the skylight above our bed frames the elegant branches of the oak, like a living woodblock print. Watched over by this mighty tree we feel, for the first time in anxious months, utterly at ease.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Horatia Harrod 2021 'Why treehouses aren't just for kids  ' FT.com 22 May.
