  "text": "<p>   CNN said it would review newly released records that show anchor Chris Cuomo coaching his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on possible responses to allegations of sexual harassment. </p><p>   The records, which were released Monday by the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James from an investigation conducted into allegations of sexual harassment against Andrew Cuomo, include text messages sent by Chris Cuomo to one of his brother's top aides and a transcript of an interview with Chris Cuomo conducted by investigators working for Ms. James. </p><p>   The records show that Chris Cuomo gave detailed feedback on his brother's statements to the press and gathered information about coming stories involving his brother's accusers. </p><p>   CNN, a unit of AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia, said that \"thousands of pages of additional transcripts and exhibits\" released by Ms. James's office \"deserve a thorough review and consideration.\" </p><p>   \"We will be having conversations and seeking additional clarity about their significance as they relate to CNN over the next several days,\" CNN said. </p><p>   Andrew Cuomo stepped down as governor of New York this year after Ms. James's office released its report, though he said that some of the allegations had no factual basis. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for Chris Cuomo referred to CNN's Monday statement. A spokesman for Andrew Cuomo said aspects of Ms. James's investigation into the former governor were politically motivated. </p><p>   \"Today's manipulated release of hand picked witness testimony with selective redactions is typical,\" the statement said. </p><p>   CNN President Jeff Zucker said in an employee meeting in May that Chris Cuomo had \"made a mistake\" by participating in strategy sessions with his brother but said he didn't see a point in suspending Chris Cuomo, adding that taking him off the air would amount to \"punishment for the sake of punishing.\" </p><p>   In September, Chris Cuomo was accused of groping a veteran TV journalist at a party in 2005 when they were co-workers at Walt Disney Co.'s ABC News. Chris Cuomo responded by saying he regretted the incident, which he said wasn't sexual in nature. CNN had no additional comment at the time. </p><p>   Andrew Cuomo has been accused by several women, including some that worked for him, of sexual misconduct that included inappropriate touching and lewd remarks. </p><p>   Ms. James's report, which was released over the summer, said Andrew Cuomo grabbed the breast of an executive assistant; caressed the neck, back and belly of a state trooper; squeezed the rear end of another employee; inappropriately touched two other women, and over the years, made a habit of hugging and kissing staff members to their discomfort. Andrew Cuomo has said he never touched anybody inappropriately. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
