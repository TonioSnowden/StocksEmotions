  "text": "<p>Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit has successfully launched a rocket in space, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of its “air launch” strategy for space transportation.</p> <p>Following the test, in which it sent small satellites into low orbit, the company said it would now “transition into commercial service for its next mission”. </p> <p>Eight months after a previous test <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d787fdc-4500-4557-97b0-c869a46b54f8\">ended in failure</a>, the company's LauncherOne rocket was on Sunday dropped from a Boeing 747 — nicknamed Cosmic Girl — off the coast of southern California at 11.39am Pacific time. </p> <p>The rocket ignited moments later and headed towards space.</p> <p>“According to telemetry, LauncherOne has reached orbit!” the company posted on Twitter 10 minutes later, confirming a successful first phase. “Everyone on the team who is not in mission control right now is going absolutely bonkers.”</p> <p>The rocket was carrying a payload of 10 satellites that will be used as part of Nasa educational missions. Virgin Orbit confirmed at 2.28pm that the payload had been deployed into low orbit. </p> <p>“We are so, so proud to say that LauncherOne has now completed its first mission to space,” the team wrote. </p> <p>Virgin Orbit's system of airborne rocket launches, which take place at 35,000 feet, stands apart from its competitors in that it removes the need for specialist ground-based launch sites. </p> <p>Virgin Orbit said its method opened up the potential to send payloads into orbit from airstrips all over the world and lessened the risk of weather-related disruption to flight plans.</p> <p>For Sunday's test, Cosmic Girl took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in southern California.</p> <p>Virgin Orbit, which was spun out as a separate company three years ago, is looking to catch up with competitors in the increasingly competitive commercial market for space transportation. </p> <p>Long Beach-based Rocket Lab has to date launched 96 satellites, according to its website. Its next mission — codenamed “Another One Leaves The Crust” — is set for launch when conditions allow from a site in New Zealand. </p> <p>Sunday's mission will give Virgin Orbit confidence in its strategy following a failed test of the system carrying a dummy payload in May, in which the rocket failed to fully ignite after being dropped from the carrier plane. Virgin Orbit chief executive Dan Hart later said that a breach in a propellent feed line had caused the rocket to prematurely shut down.</p> <p>In a statement following Sunday's test, Richard Branson said: “Virgin Orbit has achieved something many thought impossible”.</p> <p>Virgin Orbit is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d706e6a1-08bf-4755-a75b-510f8fd4b2ac\">separate effort to Virgin Galactic</a>, a company that intends to offer space tourism beginning later this year. </p> <p>Galactic will compete with Jeff Bezos's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52a1258c-4c9a-4a6f-adb9-d3c22cac1539\">Blue Origin</a>, which carried out a successful full-scale test of its New Shepard capsule last week, bringing a dummy — named Mannequin Skywalker, a play on the Star Wars character — safely back to earth after a trip to the edge of space.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/aa8d6547-ccd5-4c83-a6b7-979be44336fb.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Dave Lee in San Francisco 2021 'Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit launches rocket into space' FT.com 18 January.
