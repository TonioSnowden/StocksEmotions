  "title": "Scarlett Johansson, Disney settle pay lawsuit over ‘Black Widow'",
  "text": "<p>“I am happy to have resolved our differences with Disney,” Johansson said Thursday in a statement. “I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done together over the years and have greatly enjoyed my creative relationship with the team. I look forward to continuing our collaboration in years to come.”</p><p>The news was reported nearly simultaneously by The Hollywood Reporter, Deadline and Variety.</p><p>Financial details of the settlement were not released.</p><p>Johansson sued in July, claiming Disney cheated her out of money, since her salary for the Marvel movie was based largely on how it performed at the box office. The movie was made immediately available to Disney+ streaming subscribers for an additional $30 fee, a move Disney made due to the pandemic's effects on theaters.</p><p>“Disney intentionally induced Marvel's breach of the agreement, without justification, in order to prevent Ms. Johansson from realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel,” the suit said, suggesting a bitter legal battle that could have had long-lasting effects on Hollywood.</p><p>Disney disclosed at the time that Johansson was paid $20 million for the movie.</p><p>But Thursday, the chairman of Disney Studios seemed to put the dispute in the past, and said the studio will continue to work with her. “I'm very pleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement with Scarlett Johansson regarding&#xa0;‘Black Widow,'” Alan Bergman said in a statement. “We appreciate her contributions to the&#xa0;Marvel&#xa0;Cinematic Universe and look forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney's&#xa0;‘Tower of Terror.'”</p><p>“Black Widow” made about $184 million at the North American box office, and at least $125 million through Disney+. It will become available for Disney+ subscribers for no additional fee Oct. 6.</p><p>Disney shares DIS are down 6.6% year to date, compared to the S&amp;P 500's SPX 15% gain.</p>",
