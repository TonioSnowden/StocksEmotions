  "text": "<p>   I share many of Barton Swaim's views on modern classical music, but he is wrong to lump Igor Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" in with music he says no one wants (\"Songs Without Listeners,\" Bookshelf, July 17). </p><p>   The \"Rite\" has been wildly popular since its scandalous debut in 1914 and is one of the most recorded of all 20th-century works. It was also included in the classic Disney film \"Fantasia.\" </p><p>   Thomas Moers Mayer </p><p>   Shelter Island, N.Y. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Many new classical-music works sound like soundtracks for serial-killer or monster movies. The music may be technically challenging for the performers, but it is excruciating for listeners. </p><p>   Our local symphony recently did an Eagles concert. Rock music on violins, what a tragedy. </p><p>   Brian Zimmerman </p><p>   Hollins, Va. </p><p></p>",
