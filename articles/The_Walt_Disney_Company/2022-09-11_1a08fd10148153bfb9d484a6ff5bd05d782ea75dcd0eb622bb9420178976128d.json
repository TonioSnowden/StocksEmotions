  "title": "Cruises' Covid-19 Rules Are All Over the Place; As more travelers sign up for vacations at sea, vaccination and testing policies vary from company to company",
  "text": "<p>Travel advisers say the policies are moving closer to prepandemic norms, and some voyagers are pouncing on the opportunity to once again set sail. Yet, the rules still vary widely depending on the cruise line and destination. Before passengers embark, they need to wade through the fine print to book the trip that best fits their comfort levels and appetite for predeparture hurdles.</p><p>\"Everyone is handling it differently,\" says Christine Hardenberger, owner of Modern Travel Professionals, a travel agency based in Fredericksburg, Va.</p><p>The biggest change is that more cruise lines are allowing greater numbers of unvaccinated travelers. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Group are among those that permit unvaccinated travelers to board. In the past, some lines required these travelers to apply for exemptions. In many cases, vaccinated travelers on these lines no longer need to take a predeparture Covid-19 testâ€”but unvaccinated travelers do.</p><p>As soon as Kasey Harris heard the news, she booked a Carnival cruise set to depart the week after the rule change went into effect. She isn't vaccinated and hasn't been on a cruise since the summer of 2019.</p><p>\"As much as I love cruising, I wasn't going to do that to go on a cruise,\" the 38-year-old Ms. Harris says of getting vaccinated.</p><p>Ms. Harris and her husband, who live outside of Knoxville, Tenn., will travel to New Orleans this week for a short cruise to Cozumel, Mexico, for their anniversary. She says she will be more aware of avoiding crowded areas on board because not all travelers have to take Covid-19 tests before departure. Unvaccinated travelers must test within three days before departure.</p><p>\"I do think that they should enforce everyone to have to be tested before they get on the ship,\" she says.</p><p>Carnival says it made changes around testing and vaccination requirements after consulting with public-health experts, government officials in the destinations to which it travels, and the revised CDC public-health guidance issued in August.</p><p>Norwegian and Royal Caribbean also allow vaccinated travelers to board without a predeparture Covid-19 test for most destinations. A Norwegian spokesman declined to provide additional insight into how the decision was made. Royal Caribbean says that after the CDC's cruise program ended, it adjusted its protocols to align with others in the travel and hospitality sector while still keeping guests and communities safe.</p><p>Disney Cruise Line will allow vaccinated guests to board without a Covid-19 test result on many sailings beginning Sept. 23, and it loosened its requirements about who must be vaccinated. The cruise line recently began allowing unvaccinated children under 12 to sail on cruises departing the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Previously, Disney required all travelers ages 5 and older to be vaccinated.</p><p>Some cruise lines, including Viking, require all travelers to be fully vaccinated, meaning the full primary series dose or doses. (It encourages but doesn't require boosters.) Viking makes no exemptions for unvaccinated guests.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do the changes to Covid-19 protocols affect your plans to take a cruise? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Some travel advisers and cruise lines say the relaxed rules led to a rush of bookings during the typically slow end of summer. Since the announcements were made, there has been a double-digit increase in bookings compared with the same period in 2019, says David Crooks, senior vice president of product and operations at World Travel Holdings, a Wakefield, Mass.-based travel agency.</p><p>The group has seen more bookings by families and more people willing to book further out, including next summer, says Mr. Crooks, whose company operates many cruise-booking sites, including Dream Vacations, CruisesOnly and Cruises.com.</p><p>Other travel advisers say they didn't see an avalanche of bookings once requirements were relaxed. This could be because rules still vary by cruise line and because, as demand increases, prices are climbing, Ms. Hardenberger of Modern Travel Professionals says.</p><p>\"There are still good deals to be had, but definitely prices are starting to get back to what they were before,\" she says.</p><p>While some cruise lines allow travelers to present at-home tests before boarding, others, such as MSC Cruises, require lab-administered tests or those supervised by telehealth professionals.</p><p>The testing rules change completely if you are cruising through Bermuda or Canada. Most guests need to submit a Covid-19 test result before boarding, even if they are vaccinated, and unsupervised at-home tests aren't permitted.</p><p>Jeff Stanley, 52, and his family took a Norwegian cruise earlier this summer when both vaccination and predeparture testing were required. Now, as some of these health policies are scaled back, he says he would feel less comfortable going on a cruise.</p><p>\"Without the level of vaccination and testing that we had with our cruise, we certainly wouldn't be able to relax as much,\" says Mr. Stanley, who lives in the Atlanta area.</p><p>He has no cruises planned right now, but says in the future, he will look into lines with more stringent health requirements.</p><p>Other travelers say they are glad that some of the policies are changing. Sima Bensasson, a 67-year-old from the Palm Beach, Fla., area, has been on three cruises in the past nine months. The rules have varied each of those times, she says.</p><p>Most recently, she took an August Carnival cruise with her husband and grandson to the Bahamas. The rules changed in the days before departure. \"It was like being like a yo-yo,\" she says. They took off work to get tested, only to find out testing wasn't required on their short cruise because they are vaccinated.</p><p>Ms. Bensasson says she found testing inconvenient and is glad for less of a hassle ahead of her December cruise, where her daughter will be married at sea. She doesn't mind that Carnival requires unvaccinated travelers to take a test, but says she knows there is always a risk of getting Covid-19 on a cruise.</p><p>Write to Allison Pohle at allison.pohle@wsj.com</p><p>Cruises' Covid-19 Rules Are All Over the Place</p>",
