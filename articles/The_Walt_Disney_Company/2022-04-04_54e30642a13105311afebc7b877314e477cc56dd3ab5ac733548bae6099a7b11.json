  "text": "<p>David Kirton of Reuters reports that \"the city is straining under the demands of the country's 'dynamic clearance' strategy, with some residents complaining of crowded and unsanitary central quarantine centres, as well as difficulties in securing food and medical help.\" He adds:</p><p>Some have begun to question the policies, asking why COVID-positive children are separated from their parents.</p><p>Agence France-Presse reports:</p><p>Shanghai health officials on Monday defended separating babies and young children from their parents if they test positive for Covid-19, as frustration at the city's tough virus controls builds...</p><p>Under China's unbending virus controls, anyone found positive -- even if they are asymptomatic or have a mild infection -- must be isolated from non-infected people.</p><p>That includes children who test positive but whose family members do not... Parents and guardians voiced their anger at the policy on social media.</p><p>\"Parents need to meet 'conditions' to accompany their children? That's absurd... it should be their most basic right,\" one unnamed commenter wrote on social media platform Weibo.</p><p>Yes it should. But even parents who've been able to keep their kids at home haven't necessarily found it easy to feed them. On Sunday Alice Yan wrote in the South China Morning Post:</p><p>Over the past week a rap titled Scrambling for Vegetables became an online hit with Shanghai residents for whom the race to buy fresh food has become a part of everyday life under lockdown.</p><p>Many locals are now having to get up at 6am in the hope of being able to order vegetables and meat online before stocks run out, meaning the song's lyrics – \"Scramble for vegetables. We scramble for vegetables together. After scrambling for vegetables, we do the nucleic acid test together\" – have struck a chord with many in the city...</p><p>There are around a dozen apps that residents can use to order daily necessities, but many crash due to high demand and fresh food often sells out quickly with the whole city of 25 million effectively locked down.</p><p>***</p><p>In Other News</p><p>A Disney World of Political Trouble for Wokesters?</p><p>There seems to be a bipartisan consensus emerging that voters of all backgrounds have had enough of radical social experimentation. Matt Dixon writes in Politico about Democrats' effort to win back Hispanic voters in Florida but recent political lessons appear to apply beyond the Sunshine State:</p><p>Florida Democratic Party Chair Manny Diaz, a Cuban American former mayor of Miami, said that part of fixing Democrats' relationship with Latinos is focusing on broader \"pocketbook issues\" like the economy and health care.</p><p>\"The party overall, there is a lot of attention on Hispanics, but if you look at the numbers across the country, the party in and of itself has lost ground with working class voters in America,\" Diaz said in an interview. \"Those are Hispanics and Blacks and whites, and we are no different. For me, reversing the trend we saw with Hispanic voters in 2020 is reversing the brand that has caused us to suffer setbacks with working class voters.\"</p><p>\"The economy, education, health care — those are things that the Democratic Party has focused on in the past year,\" he added. \"We don't need to focus on these useless culture wars.\"</p><p>In fact they are often much less than useless. The Politico report has more:</p><p>Giancarlo Sopo, a Miami native who led Trump's 2020 Hispanic advertising operation, also said Democrats will be hurt by their framing of the contentious \"Parental Rights in Education\" bill, dubbed \"Don't Say Gay\" by opponents. The legislation, HB 1557, bans teachers from leading classroom lessons on gender identity or sexual orientation for students in kindergarten through third grade.</p><p>\"The Democrats have picked the losing side of each of these arguments,\" Sopo said. \"They maligned Gov. DeSantis' Covid policies, waged a dishonest culture... war with HB 1557 that was never going to resonate with Latinos and are perceived as weak on socialism.\"</p><p>***</p><p>'Dating Disasters' Kara Miller writes in the Boston Globe about a striking demographic trend:</p><p>Author and journalist Jon Birger started to sense that there was something horribly wrong with dating when he was a senior writer at Fortune Magazine in the early 2000s. Normally, he covered markets: oil, agriculture, stocks. But at his workplace, Birger says, \"I couldn't help but notice that all the guys were either married like myself, or in long-term relationships. Whereas the women at Fortune — who I think I can safely say had more going for them than we guys did — they were disproportionately single.\"</p><p>At first, he wondered if there was something strange about his workplace. But his wife, a lawyer, found her experience mirrored his. \"Particularly if you live in a city like Boston or New York, you just know all these fabulous single women in their 30s and 40s who can't seem to meet a half-decent guy,\" he said.</p><p>So Birger, who knew a strange market when he saw one, went hunting for data. At first, he thought this was a big-city problem. But, as it turned out, this wasn't about jobs or about big cities. It was about college... women now outnumber men on college campuses. And not by a little. About 60 percent of US college students are now women; only 40 percent are men. The last time there was parity, Birger says, was back in the 1980s.</p><p>And the reality is that people who have college degrees tend to date other people with college degrees. But that tendency leads to a numerical mismatch, which, for both white-collar women and blue-collar men, can have profound consequences.</p><p>***</p><p>And How Exactly Will Her Job Change? \"Jen Psaki to Exit as White House Spokesperson for MSNBC Gig Next Month,\" The Wrap, April 1</p><p>What Would We Do Without Experts?
