  "title": "With Christmas Plans in Doubt From Winter Storm, Travelers Battle Delays, Cancellations; Scrapped and postponed flights have forced thousands of air passengers to get creative to reunite with loved ones by the weekend",
  "text": "<p>As flight delays and cancellations have piled up, getting rebooked has proved challenging given that most aircraft are already full so close to Christmas. Alternative travel methods aren't a safe bet either. Rail and bus lines have had to cancel scores of itineraries because of the winter storm. Other travelers are finding limited options for rental cars, and icy conditions on the roads making driving dangerous.</p><p>Keagon Beatty is hoping that the fourth flight he has been booked to travel on since Wednesday is the one that gets him home to Michigan. He said he has been stranded in Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport since Wednesday, and has no hope of getting back home until Christmas Eve at the earliest.</p><p>\"I'm trying to keep my hopes up, but I don't think I will get out of here before Christmas,\" Mr. Beatty, 24, said as the song \"Sleigh Ride\" could be heard playing over the airport loudspeakers.</p><p>Mr. Beatty's travel ordeal began after he flew to Minneapolis from his home in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., on Tuesday for a job interview to be a mechanical engineer. Spirit Airlines canceled his return flight on Wednesday night, after three hours on the frozen tarmac. On Thursday, he spent another three hours on the tarmac in another Spirit flight before it, too, got canceled. On Friday, the firm he interviewed with paid to have him rebooked on a Delta Air Lines flight, but it got canceled. Now he is booked on a Delta flight Saturday morning.</p><p>Through all of this, Mr. Beatty said he has been stuck with his luggage, constantly in search of a quiet place to sleep with Christmas music playing in an unending loop.</p><p>\"The hardest part is the lack of privacy,\" said Mr. Beatty, who hopes to join his parents and other family in time for Christmas. \"When you wake up, there are people. When you go to sleep, there are people.\" His prospective employer is booking him into a hotel for Friday night.</p><p>In Seattle, Brie Duncan was waiting anxiously Friday as her husband, James, tried to complete a 300-mile drive over snow-covered highways and a mountain pass. He was carpooling with two strangers after they all ended up stranded at the airport in Spokane, Wash. His other option was flying on Christmas.</p><p>The odyssey began after midnight early Friday morning, when Mr. Duncan, 39, of Plano, Texas, departed Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport two hours late to join his wife and other relatives for a family reunion in Seattle. His flight got diverted to Spokane by icy weather, she said.</p><p>\"Once on the ground at 3 a.m., they were told there was no crew there and would need to wait until around 4 a.m. on the plane until there was a crew to assist with the jetways,\" said Ms. Duncan, 38, who had booked a room in a hotel near the Seattle-Tacoma airport. She had flown to Seattle earlier this month with their two boys, ages 4 and 8. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Duncan arrived safely at his destination.</p><p>Laur√©n Morgan, a 29-year-old from Des Moines, Iowa, wanted to celebrate getting her paramedic license. She and her wife booked a six-night late December getaway to Walt Disney World. It would mark her first time visiting the destination near Orlando, Fla., and she was eagerly anticipating going on the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park.</p><p>Now, Mrs. Morgan isn't sure whether she'll get to go on the ride at all. The couple endured three different flight cancellations in the span of 24 hours. They were supposed to fly to Florida on Friday, but now are booked for a flight that is leaving on Christmas Eve.</p><p>Mrs. Morgan said she and her wife debated postponing their trip until January, but were worried about additional costs they might incur by doing so. They are pushing forward with an abridged trip, but changing their plans at the last minute has presented extra complications.</p><p>Theme-park visitors can't simply show up to a Disney park and hope to get in. Since Disney's parks reopened after Covid-19-related closures, travelers are required to make park reservations. Mrs. Morgan said that by the time the couple had confirmed their new plans, no reservations were left for Hollywood Studios. Visitors can enter an additional park they didn't reserve if they have the Park Hopper upgrade, which Mrs. Morgan and her wife ended up purchasing, but admission with those tickets is limited based on capacity.</p><p>\"I just wanted to be in the warmth, relax and be with my wife and have no worries,\" Mrs. Morgan said.</p><p>Kristin Patterson was looking forward to visiting family for the holidays for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Instead, it will be another Christmas at home for the 33-year-old Toronto resident.</p><p>Ms. Patterson, who works as a visual-effects executive producer and uses they as a pronoun, has been anxiously watching weather forecasts all week. They were originally supposed to fly with their partner from Toronto to San Francisco through Chicago, but earlier this week the couple chose to rebook to fly through Newark, N.J.</p><p>The change didn't help. The flight from Toronto Pearson International Airport to Newark was canceled. They tried to get a flight out of another Toronto city airport instead, but planes out of the area have been grounded due to the weather. The earliest flights Ms. Patterson could get through United are for Dec. 27 or 28.</p><p>\"These were really expensive flights that we booked because we wanted to get there for the holidays,\" they said. \"I don't know if it makes sense for us to keep the trip if we're only going to be there for a couple days.\"</p><p>Lauren Torvi Prochazka drove six hours from her home in Rapid City, S.D., on Thursday to extricate three family members stuck at Denver's airport. Both her parents, flying to Rapid City from Rhode Island, and sister, returning home from an Atlanta business trip, had the same connecting flight to South Dakota canceled Wednesday in Dallas.</p><p>They rebooked into Denver in hopes of catching a commuter plane into an alternate airport in Nebraska, but it too got canceled. The trio tried to rent a car, but they were all sold out. With temperatures of minus-11, Ms. Prochazka decided there was only one option: Jump in her SUV.</p><p>\"The wind was blowing snow across the road, and at times it was hard to see the pavement,\" she said.</p><p>Twelve hours later, the travelers arrived safely. \"We are just happy to get everyone home,\" Ms. Prochazka said.</p><p>Write to Jim Carlton at Jim.Carlton@wsj.com and Jacob Passy at jacob.passy@wsj.com</p><p>With Christmas Plans in Doubt From Winter Storm, Travelers Battle Delays, Cancellations</p>",
