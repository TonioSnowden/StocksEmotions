  "title": "Steven Spielberg Made 'West Side Story' Without Subtitles, Says Translating Spanish Would Be 'Disrespectful'; The director chose not to translate the Spanish dialogue into English in his update of the classic musical",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Spielberg said the choice was intentional. Using subtitles would be \"very disrespectful\" to Spanish-speakers, he said, because it would have signaled that they weren't the intended audience. Lines in Spanish are loosely dispersed, and designed to be \"understood emotionally for those who don't understand a single word of Spanish,\" the director said during a panel discussion this week. If that forces non-Spanish speakers to listen closer to keep up, or even miss a few jokes, that's part of the point.</p><p>\"West Side Story\" is a high-profile example of filmmakers' efforts to speak directly to the people their stories are about. Songs in Disney's animated musical \"Encanto\" unfold in Spanish without translation. The FX series \"Reservation Dogs\" drops in Native American slang and cultural references without explanation.</p><p>It would have been unheard of a decade ago for a major release to forgo translations, for fear of alienating potential ticket buyers. \"West Side Story\" shows a shift in Hollywood's thinking about audiences, especially as viewers gravitate to more non-English options. Recent foreign-language hits, from South Korea's \"Parasite\" and \"Squid Game\" to France's \"Lupin,\" show that entertainment doesn't need to originate in English to have broad appeal.</p><p>The smash-hit 1961 film \"West Side Story\" didn't use subtitles either, but the Spanish words were sporadic, including typical Hollywood seasonings such as \"muchachos\" and \"v√°monos.\"</p><p>The new movie's more-expansive Spanish lines up with box-office demographics. Hispanic people have long had a higher per capita attendance rate at U.S. movie theaters than other ethnicities, according to the Motion Picture Association. In 2020, Hispanics represented about 19% of the U.S. population, but accounted for 29% of movie tickets sold. Whites bought 49% of movie tickets, down from 54% in 2019.</p><p>\"If 'West Side Story' is trying to market to the population that purchases more than 25% of all film tickets, then they made a good decision,\" says Brenda Castillo, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition. \"By not using subtitles, the movie incorporates what this country is really like. It's bilingual and sometimes multilingual.\"</p><p>The film will remain in its current format when it later moves to streaming and other platforms, 20th Century Studios said.</p><p>The cultural choices made by Mr. Spielberg, writer Tony Kushner and their team carry added weight because of the musical's huge influence and its mixed legacy on race.</p><p>The original 1957 Broadway show (by director and choreographer Jerome Robbins, composer Leonard Bernstein, lyricist Stephen Sondheim and playwright Arthur Laurents) broke ground by putting Latino characters at the center of a reinterpretation of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" But the 1961 movie has been criticized for casting white actors wearing brown makeup to play Puerto Ricans.</p><p>Even Rita Moreno was made up to look darker for the role of Anita, which earned her one of the film's 10 Oscars. Ms. Moreno is an executive producer of Mr. Spielberg's remake. She also plays a new character, Valentina, who watches over Tony (Ansel Elgort) and translates phrases into Spanish for him to court Maria.</p><p>Mr. Kushner, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer behind Mr. Spielberg's \"Lincoln\" and \"Munich,\" has said he initially converted portions of his screenplay into Spanish by feeding lines into Google's translation software. He recruited a friend from the theater world, Julio Monge, to collaborate on the translation.</p><p>Mr. Monge is a dancer and actor who left Puerto Rico for New York in 1986 at age 19. He has worked with the Jerome Robbins estate to set up productions of \"West Side Story\" around the world, and first came to Mr. Spielberg's project to check new choreography by Justin Peck for the estate. Soon, he was helping Mr. Kushner parse the way Puerto Ricans of New York spoke in the 1950s.</p><p>He compiled curse words for the Sharks gang, tracking the different meanings those epithets had back then. He questioned older friends about the cultural juxtapositions of the era, noting that new New Yorkers like Maria would have already been schooled in English in Puerto Rico. He worked to match the cadences of Mr. Kushner's writing in the translations, and debated nuances with the movie's dialect coaches and cast members.</p><p>The aim was to create a realistic flow to the bilingual dialogue, not the token Spanglish heard in some movies and TV shows. \"As an actor I've played many parts where I've had to speak that awful mix,\" Mr. Monge says, \"and I find it pushes away a great deal of the audience.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do reimagined classics make you think differently about the original creation? Join the conversation below.</p><p>He describes the filmmakers' decision to forgo subtitles as a pleasant surprise, one that challenged the team to choose authentic phrases that could still be universally deciphered. For example, when Bernardo (David Alvarez) uses \"bien linda\" to remark how beautiful Maria looks in her white dress for a dance.</p><p>In the scenes where Spanish stands on its own, Mr. Monge says, \"It shouldn't feel foreign. It should feel logical.\"</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>Steven Spielberg Made 'West Side Story' Without Subtitles, Says Translating Spanish Would Be 'Disrespectful'</p>",
