  "title": "YouTube TV Loses Disney Channels Including ESPN in Standoff; Blackout deprives more than four million subscribers of programming as companies battle over distribution fees",
  "text": "<p>The companies are fighting over distribution fees for the Disney channels. A sticking point is YouTube TV's request for a clause that would guarantee it pays the same rate as distributors of a similar size, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Although YouTube TV doesn't disclose the number of subscribers, a person close to the company said it is more than four million. Its subscriber count tops the traditional pay-TV providers Altice USA Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., according to data from MoffettNathanson.</p><p>YouTube TV carries more than a dozen Disney channels, plus local broadcast channels. The loss removes a sizable chunk of YouTube TV's offering. YouTube TV said it would drop its monthly subscription price to $49.99 from $64.99 as long as the channels are unavailable.</p><p>The impasse between the programmer and distributor spilled out into the public earlier this week when YouTube began to notify subscribers that they could soon lose access to Disney's programming. YouTube TV also took the unusual step of encouraging subscribers to purchase a subscription to Disney's streaming services such as Disney+ and ESPN+ to regain access to some of the content they would lose.</p><p>Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com and Patience Haggin at patience.haggin@wsj.com</p><p>YouTube TV Loses Disney Channels Including ESPN in Standoff</p>",
