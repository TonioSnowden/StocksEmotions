  "title": "What I Learned Growing Up With the Gritty Movies of the '70s; When the culture is pitched over your head as a child, you learn how to make inferences, wait for clarity and keep your cool even when lost",
  "text": "<p>That absence of intelligibility supplied many of us with an ethos: It is OK to see and not comprehend, to gather from context, to laugh when you're not exactly sure what's funny. If you don't get it now, just wait. All things will be clear in the end. Or clear enough.</p><p>The vast preteen movie market had only just begun to emerge in 1977, the year of \"Star Wars.\" Even many of the movies made for kids in the 1970s were marked by the same raunchy complexity that characterized the work of Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader. \"The Bad News Bears\" lost at the end, as did Rocky (both in 1976). The boxer in the 1979 version of \"The Champ,\" a movie that traumatized me, wins the fight, then dies in the dressing room.</p><p>Coping with failure by necessity, plumbing the mystery of loss: These are themes my kids have seldom encountered at the movies, because the culture has been directed at them from birth. Between 1970 and 1974, according to IMDB, the top five American movies were \"Love Story,\" \"Diamonds Are Forever,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"The Exorcist\" and \"Blazing Saddles.\" Between 2010 and 2014, the top five American movies were \"Toy Story 3,\" \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" \"The Avengers,\" \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" What's more, the movies that are made for adults have become less complicated—more like kid movies—while the kid movies have been stuffed with inside jokes and irony, sops to the grown-ups forced to sit with their charges in the dark.</p><p>I have a 19-year-old and a 7-year-old, which means that for more than a decade, I've been sitting in the theater thinking: We got screwed. When I was 10, they took me to see \"Annie Hall.\" At 53, I took them to see \"Clifford: The Big Red Dog.\" That is life for those born between 1964 and 1980, caught between huge demographic swells.</p><p>But here's what I tell myself: We're better off! It is the coming generations, for whom pop art is defined by clarity—the crooked is made straight, the fog never lingers—who lose out. Not understanding and finding humility and even pleasure in knowing you don't understand—that is what we got from growing up in the raucous '70s cineplex dark. If you understand everything, you learn nothing. If you know nothing, and accept it, you are open to everything. Intelligibility is overrated.</p><p>What I Learned Growing Up With the Gritty Movies of the '70s</p>",
