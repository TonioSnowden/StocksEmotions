  "title": "Russia launches fierce rocket attack on Ukrainian city of Kharkiv",
  "text": "<p>Russian forces have launched a heavy bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, an assault that overshadowed the first direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials since President Vladimir Putin began his invasion six days ago.</p> <p>Residents of the city said they had come under intense artillery and rocket fire from Russian positions on Monday. Video footage shared on social media showed high-rise apartment blocks in Kharkiv being hit by heavy shelling that shrouded the sky with plumes of dark smoke.</p> <p>“Dozens of civilians are dying,” said regional governor Oleh Sinegubov. “It's happening during the day when people go to pharmacies, for food, for drinking water. This is a crime.”</p> <p>Russia's military operation has failed to unseat Ukraine's government or capture any major cities, but has uprooted hundreds of thousands of civilians who have fled to neighbouring countries in search of safety. </p> <p>Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on Monday showed that a Russian convoy heading towards Kyiv from the north had grown in length to several dozen kilometres.</p> <p>The war has cranked east-west tensions to new heights, with Putin putting the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bf149f7-6f70-4d8b-bc69-13a6c1f56e33\">nuclear deterrent on high alert</a> and the west imposing swingeing sanctions on Moscow that sent the rouble into a tailspin and prompted Russia's central bank to impose capital controls. A defiant Putin denounced the west as an “empire of lies”. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/20f4f829-4ba6-4f25-9e51-8c19a2a8825b.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>On Tuesday, Australia became the latest US ally to commit military aid, promising $50mn for weapons and $25mn of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as it dubbed Russia a “pariah state” over its invasion of the country.&#xa0;</p> <p>Scott Morrison, prime minister, said most of the military aid would be for equipment including missiles and ammunition. Morrison also reiterated his criticism of China for not participating in the sanctions programmes. “No one should have anything to do with them,” he said of Russia. </p> <p>The sanctions continued to impact companies around the world, with Mastercard blocking multiple financial institutions from its payment network. Walt Disney said it would pause the release of its films in Russian cinemas while WarnerMedia's <em>The Batman</em> will not open in the country this week as planned.</p> <p>Western officials have warned that the number of civilian deaths from Russia's invasion is likely to increase as a result of Moscow's decision to deploy heavy artillery attacks on the cities of Kharkiv and Kyiv. </p> <p>“I am very concerned at what we are seeing today in the increased use of artillery, both rocket and tube artillery in Kyiv, in Kharkiv . . . that increase in artillery risks being far more indiscriminate,” said a western official on Monday. “As a consequence we are going to see an increase in civilian casualties.”</p> <p>Ukraine's US ambassador told reporters on Monday that Russia had used a thermobaric bomb, which draws in oxygen to create an especially intense explosion — although this could not be independently verified. The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said he hoped to open an investigation “as rapidly as possible” into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine.</p> <p>As Russia faced increasing international isolation&#xa0;over its invasion, Emmanuel Macron, president of France, phoned Putin to demand he end the offensive, Macron's office said.</p> <p>He urged the Russian leader to stop all strikes against civilians, preserve civilian infrastructure and provide safe access to key roads, especially south of Kyiv, Macron's office added. The Elysée said Putin “confirmed his willingness to pursue these three points”.</p> <p>According to the Kremlin, Putin told Macron that a settlement was possible “only if Russia's legitimate security interests are unconditionally taken into account”. That included recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, the peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and “demilitarising” and “de-Nazifying” the Ukrainian state. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8828976.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held talks on Monday near the Belarus border, but they failed to yield a breakthrough. </p> <p>Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who took part in the negotiations, said the delegations would return to their respective capitals for consultations. “The talks are difficult . . . The Russians unfortunately still have an extremely biased view of the destructive processes they have unleashed,” he said.</p> <p>Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia's delegation, said: “The most important thing is that we agreed to continue negotiating.”</p> <p>While Russia has made some military gains in southern Ukraine, the pace of its advance has slowed and it is yet to take any big Ukrainian population centres, with the capital, Kyiv, still under government control.</p> <p>A senior US defence official said 75 per cent of the Russian combat forces that had amassed on the border had moved into Ukraine. Russian soldiers had advanced roughly 5km towards Kyiv since Sunday and were now within 25km of the centre of the capital, the official added. </p> <p>“We expect that they're going to want to continue to move forward and try and circle the city in coming days,” the official said.</p> <p>John Kirby, Pentagon spokesperson, said on Monday that the Pentagon was aware of the convoy of forces and equipment moving towards Kyiv but did not have a sense of its timeline.</p> <p>“Clearly, we continue to see Russian forces . . . try to move closer so they can move on Kyiv from the ground,” Kirby said.</p> <p>Kirby also said that while Russia had suffered setbacks that it had not envisioned, it was “too soon for us to have some sort of sweeping conclusions” about the strength of Russian forces.</p> <p>In southern Ukraine, Russian attempts to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea appeared to be having more success. Its forces have captured the towns of Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov, and Enerhodar, according to a Russian defence ministry statement.</p> <p>Reports suggested that the port of Mariupol, the last big stronghold of Ukrainian resistance that has stopped Russia from connecting the eastern border region of Donbas to Crimea, was surrounded.</p> <p>Russian and Ukrainian military claims cannot be independently verified.</p> <p>But the bombardment of Kharkiv appeared to be particularly intense. Sinegubov, the regional governor, said Russia had used “weapons prohibited by all international conventions — in particular, cluster bombs” and targeted residential areas. “There was no military infrastructure here,” he said. “There is no excuse for this crime.”</p> <p>One doctor working at a Kharkiv hospital said it had admitted at least 17 people injured by shelling, and that a 17-year-old girl had been killed after being hit in the chest.</p> <p>“This is a Russian-speaking region of Ukraine,” the doctor said. “All this situation feels like an illusion. It feels like we are dreaming.”</p> <p>Russia's armed forces denied claims that they had encircled the capital and said civilians could safely leave on the highway to the town of Vasylkiv, the scene of heavy weekend fighting.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/344e888f-ca06-44aa-9c21-454153b07e70.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Guy Chazan in Lviv, John Reed in Kyiv, Max Seddon in Moscow, Henry Foy in Brussels, John Paul Rathbone in London and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington 2022 'Russia launches fierce rocket attack on Ukrainian city of Kharkiv' FT.com 1 March.
