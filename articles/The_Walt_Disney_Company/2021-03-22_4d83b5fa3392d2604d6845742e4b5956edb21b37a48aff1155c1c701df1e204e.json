  "text": "<p>The theater, a historic treasure that opened in 1926, is on one of Los Angeles' busiest thoroughfares, Hollywood Boulevard. At it, and other theaters in the city, masks are required, spaces have been sanitized, concession vendors sell everything prepackaged from behind plexiglass and capacity is limited to 25% or 100 people, whichever is less.</p><p>For months, executives at Hollywood's biggest studios and theater chains said that when big-city markets like Los Angeles and New York reopened, combined with a successful rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine, it would help revive the theater business.</p><p>Now, after theaters in New York opened two weeks ago and those in Los Angeles this weekend, the industry will get a look at how desperate moviegoers might be to return. Pre-pandemic, Los Angeles accounted for about 8% of domestic moviegoing -- America's largest metropolitan theatrical market -- according to media measurement company Comscore.</p><p>\"It's kind of an emotional day,\" Mr. Ruiz said, eyes watering after his first movie-theater visit since March 2020.</p><p>Movie theaters hold a special place in L.A.'s history and economy. So when many theaters there threw open their doors Friday for the first time in a year, people showed up, in some cases filling every seat available.</p><p>With restricted audience size, El Capitan felt more like an 11 a.m. Tuesday matinee. Still, General Manager James Wood posed for photographs with local news crews, ecstatic to see movie fans again in the halls where he's worked for two decades. \"My whole focus was on this moment,\" Mr. Wood said, pleased that two of the day's four screenings had sold out at limited capacity.</p><p>With no more than a hundred people in the approximately 1,000-seat El Capitan, people weren't shy about putting feet up on chairs in front of them or pulling down their masks to munch on snacks.</p><p>Data collected by National Research Group, which has tracked moviegoer sentiment for 40 years, says 57% of those polled before the weekend expressed comfort with the prospect of returning to theaters, up from a low of 19% in April 2020. Though theaters around the U.S. have been slowly reopening in recent months, attendance has been sluggish as Hollywood studios shelved would-be big-screen spectacles.</p><p>\"Seeing all the movies keep getting pushed back and back and back kept breaking my heart,\" said Allison Sharpley, who on Friday ventured out on her lonesome to her favorite local theater, AMC's Century City 15, so she could see Universal Pictures' Oscar-nominated \"Promising Young Woman.\"</p><p>Like \"Raya and the Last Dragon,\" \"Promising Young Woman\" can be streamed.</p><p>The 45-year-old healthcare professional said she tried drive-ins during the pandemic. But sitting in a car or watching from home doesn't compare, she said. \"I didn't want to see 'Wonder Woman' for the first time on my dinky 32-inch TV,\" she said.</p><p>During the pandemic, Hollywood studios released more new movies online, a move that put many theater owners on their heels. Before, movie theaters' coveted exclusivity window -- when movies are available only in theaters -- was the bedrock of their business.</p><p>With Los Angeles open again, the country's largest theater chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., says 98% of its theaters are now operational. But the nation's second-largest chain, Cineworld Group PLC's Regal Entertainment Group, has yet to reopen in America. Third-largest chain Cinemark Holdings Inc. now has about 90% of its theaters open.</p><p>Netflix Inc. chose to project its black-and-white film \"Mank\" in some Los Angeles-area theaters ahead of this year's Oscars on April 25. Some moviegoers on Friday headed to the theater to see it on the big screen.</p><p>\"Mank,\" which nabbed more Academy Award nominations than any other movie in this year's Oscar field, goes behind the scenes into the making of what many critics call the greatest film of all time, director Orson Welles's \"Citizen Kane.\" Nearly 80 years ago, Mr. Welles held the movie's Hollywood premiere at El Capitan in May 1941.</p><p>\"This is my favorite theater,\" said Shahbaaz Shah, a 38-year-old animation director at Disney who hauled his two teenage sons -- one of whom wants to get into filmmaking -- from the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale to the El Capitan to see \"Raya and the Last Dragon.\"</p><p>When the lights came up, the scattered audience filled the auditorium with applause.</p>",
