  "title": "Investors  Flock Into  Market  For Munis  ----  By Sebastian Pellejero",
  "text": "<p>   Investors in search of higher returns and lower taxes are scooping up debt sold by state and local governments, pushing borrowing costs to near-record lows and boosting coffers from California to Connecticut. </p><p>   A net $39 billion has poured into municipal-bond mutual funds this year through Thursday, according to data compiled by Municipal Market Analytics, the most over the same period since 2008. Returns on the debt, which local governments use to fund public works such as sewers or bridges, have beaten those of corporate bonds and Treasurys. </p><p>   Demand is so intense that Illinois, the only state to tap the Federal Reserve's pandemic emergency-lending program, recently sold three-year bonds at yields near 1%. The Biden administration's proposed tax changes also could potentially make municipal debt more attractive to investors. </p><p>   Considered almost as safe as Treasurys because they are backed by taxes or payments on essential services like water, municipal bonds typically offer interest payments that are tax-free. </p><p>   The furor marks a reversal from the pandemic's lows. In the spring of 2020, cash-hungry investors dumped even safe munis at steep discounts. Many predicted tax collections would plunge and mounting financial distress would spur a wave of defaults. City and state borrowing froze. Defaults did climb, but investors started to return after actions by the Federal Reserve that April -- including cutting interest rates and buying billions of dollars of bonds -- buoyed the municipal-debt market and the economy. Tax collections exceeded expectations, state and local governments lifted revenue forecasts for this year and stimulus money from the federal government began flooding in. </p><p>   Bank of America analysts in a recent note said the municipal market is entering \"a new golden decade of strong growth and strengthening credit quality.\" Moody's Investors Service raised its outlook for state and local governments to stable from negative after the passage of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill in March, saying the funds would stabilize state finances and help avoid funding cuts for local governments. </p><p>   Investors will get a fresh look at the strength of the economy's reopening this week after Friday's disappointing jobs report, parsing earnings from Walt Disney Co. and delivery service DoorDash Inc., along with new data on consumer prices and retail sales. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Friday at a record. </p><p>   Municipal bonds held up better than other fixed-income assets during the broader bond-market decline earlier this year. Munis returned 0.59% to investors this year through May 6, counting price changes and interest payments, beating a minus-3.22% total return on Treasurys and minus 3.1% on corporate bonds, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. Riskier high-yield munis have returned 3.87% over the same period, ahead of the 2.15% return on junk bonds from U.S. companies. </p><p>   \"We made it through a tough year with very minor problems,\" said Dan Solender, director of tax-free fixed-income investments at Lord Abbett &amp; Co. </p><p>   One factor driving recent gains, some analysts say: State and local governments can't sell bonds fast enough for investors. Bond sales have increased so far this year compared with the same period in 2020, when state and local governments sold the most bonds in a decade in an effort to manage pandemic costs. </p><p>   Borrowers have sold $124 billion in new bonds this year as of Friday, according to Municipal Market Analytics. Meanwhile, refinancings and money paid back to investors totaled around $131 billion. That has led to a $7 billion mismatch, increasing demand for new bonds. </p><p>   \"We have money raining out of the sky,\" said Ben Watkins, director of bond finance for the state of Florida, referring to the favorable market conditions and stimulus aid. \"We're in a much better position now than if Covid hadn't hit at all.\" </p><p>   Both state and local governments selling debt in recent months received favorable terms. Illinois saved millions of dollars in mid-March when it borrowed $1.26 billion. That included bonds due in 2024 sold at a 1.09% yield, below the 3.42% that the state is paying on similar-dated debt held by the Fed after it tapped the central bank's pandemic backstop program. </p><p>   A $34 million Illinois bond rated triple-B minus -- at the bottom of investment-grade -- and due in 10 years recently traded for around 128 cents on the dollar, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access. It yielded 1.86%, down from 2.22% when issued in March. </p><p>   \"There are just far more lenders than there are borrowers,\" said Matt Fabian, head of research at Municipal Market Analytics. \"That keeps municipal-bond yields pinned as low as you can go.\" </p><p>   The average yield on 10-year triple-A-rated munis was 0.82% at Friday's close, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That is less than 0.2 percentage point above the record low yield of 0.68% from February, in data going back to 1993. Yields fall when bond prices rise. </p><p>   While proposed federal infrastructure spending could ease the jam by putting local policy makers in better position to issue more muni bonds for other projects, many expect new demand for munis from wealthy households if the Biden administration's plan to raise capital-gains taxes advances in Congress. In a report to clients last week, analysts at UBS recommended they consider buying munis over corporate bonds as one way to reduce taxable income. Changes to the tax code, such as caps on state and local deductions,  have cut down on other popular ways to limit taxable income. </p><p>   Yields on 10-year triple-A-rated munis are currently around half of those on 10-year Treasury rates. Munis typically yield less than federal debt because of the tax advantage they provide. The current discount exceeds historical levels, a sign of investors' hearty appetite for the debt. </p><p></p>",
