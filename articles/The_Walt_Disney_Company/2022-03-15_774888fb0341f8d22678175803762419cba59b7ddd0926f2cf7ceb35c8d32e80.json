  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\"><strong>Wirecard</strong></a>'s former chief executive <strong>Markus Braun</strong> has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0bcaaab-546a-4e37-861e-2a29f28e1998\">formally charged</a> by Munich public prosecutors with fraud, breach of trust and accounting manipulation after a 21-month criminal investigation into the collapse of the German payments group.</p> <h2>The Tudor mansion fit for a king, and possibly a Russian oligarch</h2> <p>How do you seize a house if you can't prove who owns it? </p> <p>That's the question facing the UK government which, having talked tough about sanctioning oligarchs, could now be hamstrung by the country's knotty property ownership structures. </p> <p>The scale of the challenge facing ministers is brought to life by the curious case of Sutton Place, a sprawling, Grade I-listed manor house built in Surrey for a courtier of<strong> Henry VIII</strong>. </p> <p>Almost 20 years after the home last changed hands, the identity of its ultimate buyer remains a mystery. </p> <p>The government claims the house now belongs to<strong> Alisher Usmanov</strong>, the Uzbekistan-born Russian multi-billionaire who once tried to buy <strong>Arsenal football club</strong> and was recently slapped with sanctions. But Usmanov's people have cast doubt on that assertion. </p> <p>The ownership of the estate can be traced back as far as 1521 when it was entrusted by Henry VIII to the diplomat <strong>Sir Richard Weston</strong>.</p> <p>Fast forward to more recent times and the manor was bought in the late 1950s by the American oil baron<strong> John Paul Getty</strong>, who sold it to the art collector <strong>Stanley J. Seeger</strong> until it was purchased by the late industrial scion <strong>Frederick R. Koch</strong> (not to be confused with his Republican mega-donor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fda23812-d724-4112-a5ec-78b836a89894\">younger brothers</a>). But since the eldest Koch <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/1999/07/01/sutton-place-the-surrey-estate-owned-by-a-succession-of-america-art-collectors-has-appeared-on-the-market\">put the place up for sale</a> in 1999, the trail became harder to follow.</p> <p>George Hammond, the FT's property correspondent, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69bfee5f-277b-4e81-b1f7-b5031d112169\">tried to find an answer</a> by pulling at a thread that runs from the 16th-century house, through an office in Nicosia, Cyprus, and has tangential links to a battered industrial estate in Bounds Green, north London. </p> <p>It was there where opposite a nursery and a shop selling bathroom tiles he found the registered offices of one company named “<strong>Arsenal Minerals</strong>” and another directed by a Russian who built his fortune in vodka and real estate and who once was a business partner of Usmanov.</p> <p>But among the clues, there was no definitive answer to the vexed question of the Tudor manor's ownership.</p> <p>Instead, the hunt for an owner shines a light on the opaque, convoluted ownership structures that have helped make UK property a preferred destination for the global wealthy to park their millions (or billions) discreetly. </p> <p>The government is looking to rein in the system by introducing a register of ownership long called for by transparency campaigners. </p> <p>The measures used by the super-rich to disguise ownership date back to the Middle Ages, when noblemen fighting wars overseas placed their land in trusts, while retaining rights to use the land and benefiting if it was sold. </p> <p>“That's how landed estates remained intact in England,” explained one property lawyer. “But no one was using offshore companies in Antigua during the Crusades.”</p> <h2>The dealmaker driving Apollo's education gambit</h2> <p><strong>Apollo Global</strong> began investing in the education sector nearly 25 years ago when two of its Beverly Hills-based dealmakers, <strong>Tony Ressler </strong>and <strong>Larry Berg</strong>, led its investment in language tutoring service <strong>Berlitz</strong>.</p> <p>For Ressler, it was one of his last deals before leaving Apollo and creating <strong>Ares Management</strong>, the investment giant with more than $300bn in assets that has made him a billionaire.</p> <p>Berg, like Ressler, cut his teeth at junk bond financier <strong>Michael Milken</strong>'s <strong>Drexel Burnham Lambert </strong>and was at Apollo in the early 1990s. He stayed with the firm, becoming a prominent investor in the education sector. </p> <p>After flipping Berlitz to a Japanese buyer, Berg led a string of education deals including the 2004 acquisition of <strong>Connections Academy</strong>, which Apollo sold to <strong>Pearson </strong>in 2011. Now, he's trying to buy Pearson outright.</p> <p>On Friday, Pearson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b71a591f-e773-41df-ba90-221fd23cc53c#comments-anchor\">rejected</a> a £7bn takeover bid from Apollo saying it “significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects”. Berg is leading the deal to take private the London-based education group, which sold the FT to Japan's <strong>Nikkei</strong> in 2015, alongside a team of Apollo dealmakers, DD hears.</p> <p>The takeover attempt comes just months after Apollo sold textbook publisher <strong>McGraw Hill </strong>to private equity firm <strong>Platinum Equity</strong>, which is operated by another Beverly Hills financier, billionaire dealmaker <strong>Tom Gores</strong>.</p> <p>Under its ownership, Apollo shifted McGraw Hill's sales away from printed textbooks to digital subscriptions. At a sale price of $4.5bn, the deal made Apollo about four times its money, according to a source. </p> <p>Apollo wants to apply the McGraw Hill playbook to Pearson, a perennial underperformer whose share price is barely half the level it reached in 2015. </p> <p>Pearson has largely squandered the proceeds of recent asset sales, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbeed09d-6785-4ea2-b007-24bb40ec1e48\">Lex writes</a>. <strong>Andy Bird</strong>, the former <strong>Disney</strong> executive who has run the publisher since late 2020, has made some headway boosting online subscription services. But digital sales haven't offset the sharp decline in the higher education business.</p> <p>Some deal watchers question how Apollo would pull together the debt financing for a UK transaction of this scale, despite Pearson's low leverage. </p> <p>The last time bankers underwrote such a deal was when <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>Bank of America</strong>, <strong>BNP Paribas </strong>and <strong>Mizuho Bank </strong>agreed to provide £6.6bn of bridge loans to back <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong>'s take-private of the supermarket chain <strong>Wm Morrison</strong> last year. </p> <p>The banks are still sitting on those bridge loans, having twice called off plans to syndicate the debt — though they did privately sell a chunk of the riskiest debt to the <strong>Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board</strong>. </p> <p>But Apollo might try to avoid UK debt markets entirely given two-thirds of Pearson's revenue is US-based. It could also bring in the help of private credit firms such as Ressler's <strong>Ares</strong>. The private lender sits on billions of undrawn capital and doesn't have banking assets to worry about.</p> <p>Berg himself maintains close ties to Ares as a co-owner of the<strong> Los Angeles Football Club</strong> of the MLS, alongside Ares CEO <strong>Michael Arougheti </strong>and <strong>Bennett Rosenthal</strong>, one of the firm's top dealmakers.</p> <h2>Powerpoints and paella: a junior analyst's paradise</h2> <p>Málaga: home of <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong>, golden sand beaches, and — eventually — 30 <strong>Citigroup </strong>employees.</p> <p>The infamous “working conditions survey” compiled by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">burnt-out</a> Goldman Sachs junior analysts led banks to raise salaries in an attempt to retain talent and ride out the dealmaking boom. </p> <p>But the US bank run by <strong>Jane Fraser</strong> has struggled to keep up with the industry's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83fea40d-eae7-4386-be34-013ed963589e\">costly talent war</a> for young staffers. While Citi's embrace of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf430bc8-569f-4e0e-8ae8-97f4ce497ef3\">hybrid working</a> made it more appealing to some than its rivals, the bank doled out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bdef7a6-69f1-4f42-b27d-74dd34db4804\">smaller bonuses</a> than its peers. </p> <p>The solution? A new hub in Málaga which Citi hopes will boost morale in a more cost-effective way.</p> <p>The US bank is luring a new class of so-called “junior banking analysts” to the Spanish city with promises of cheaper living, eight-hour workdays and protected weekends.</p> <p>But there's a catch: the enforced work/life balance means Málaga staff will be paid about half the starting salaries allotted to first-year analysts in London or New York.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has promoted<strong> Ihsan Essaid</strong> to co-head of global M&amp;A alongside<strong> Gary Posternack</strong>, based in New York. Essaid joined the UK investment bank last year from <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>BNP Paribas </strong>has hired <strong>Apoorva Shah,</strong> <strong>Nomura's</strong> former head of Asian M&amp;A, to lead its UK business.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbe47108-a23b-4d1c-b2b6-4f6365ce0246\">has started the search</a> for a new chief risk officer to replace <strong>Mark Smith</strong>, and has also begun preparing for the eventual departure of its chief financial officer <strong>Andy Halford</strong>, who is considering retiring.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>has promoted <strong>Virginie de Grivel Nigam</strong>, currently head of its equity-linked business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, to head of equity capital markets for the UK and Ireland. She succeeds <strong>Barry Meyers</strong>, who is leaving for a job outside banking. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Benny Zachariah</strong> is joining JPMorgan as head of loan syndications for central and eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa, based in London. He joins from <strong>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Coup on the course</strong> Before the controversial Super League, there was a Saudi golf incursion courting the sport's top players and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/players-championship-phil-mickelson-saudi-super-golf-league-pga-tour-11647185229\">stirring up geopolitical drama</a> on the green, the Wall Street Journal reports.</p> <p><strong>Midtown makeover </strong>New York City is <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/manhattan/2022/3/7/22966532/midtown-office-apartment-conversion-hochul-adams\">looking to clear the tumbleweeds</a> from its largest business district and build residential spaces to adapt to the work-from-home shift.
