  "title": "Third Point Buys Stake In Disney, Seeks Spinoff",
  "text": "<p>Third Point's new stake consists of less than 1% of Disney's shares outstanding, valued today at around $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mr. Loeb praised growth in Disney's streaming-subscriber base, but wanted Disney to more aggressively cut costs and consider a number of steps to shake up its portfolio.</p><p>\"We welcome the views of all our investors,\" Disney said in response to Third Point's letter. It said its board has been continuously refreshed, \"with an average tenure of four years.\"</p><p>The investor's calls come at an inflection point for Disney and the streaming industry at large, which enjoyed explosive growth during Covid-19 but now face headwinds that include financial losses, domestic-subscriber saturation and churn as well as inflation pressures on consumers.</p><p>News of the new investment comes days after Disney reported strong earnings for its fiscal third quarter. It added 14.4 million subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service and flexed its pricing power by unveiling increases for several streaming offerings.</p><p>Mr. Loeb thinks Disney's streaming business -- and market conditions for companies in the space -- is in better shape than it was six months ago, and the company's goal of making Disney+ profitable by the end of fiscal 2024 is reasonable, according to a person familiar with Third Point's strategy.</p><p>The letter represents a fresh challenge for Mr. Chapek, who assumed the CEO job in February 2020, one month before Covid-19 shut down the company's theme parks and the nation's movie theaters.</p><p>Mr. Chapek's contract was renewed through the end of 2024 this summer, and recent subscriber growth in Disney's flagship service, Disney+, has shown the company is advancing on the streaming industry's dominant player, Netflix Inc. A spinoff of ESPN -- itself a source of paying subscribers through its ESPN+ offering -- would alter Disney's presence in the streaming ecosystem.</p><p>With Disney's new customer additions, the total at all of its streaming services reached 221.1 million subscribers, putting it narrowly ahead of Netflix, which last month reported it had 220.67 million subscribers. Disney's stock price rose 2.2% Monday to $124.26.</p><p>Mr. Loeb's letter urges Disney to rethink the makeup of its board and to consider a list of potential new members that Third Point compiled. It advocates for a cost-cutting program and the continuation of Disney's pandemic-era suspension of cash dividend payments. Third Point would like to see more Disney directors with expertise in the digital advertising and consumer data spaces because that sort of expertise isn't represented on the board, according to a person familiar with the hedge fund's strategy.</p><p>Mr. Loeb's fund is pushing Disney to \"make every attempt\" to buy Comcast Corp.'s minority stake in the streaming service Hulu before a window opens in early 2024 to acquire the stake. Under a 2019 agreement, Comcast can require Disney to purchase its NBCUniversal subsidiary's one-third stake in Hulu for at least $9 billion, assuming the streaming service has an equity value greater than $27.5 billion.</p><p>Third Point thinks the Hulu deal is of urgent importance and that it has been made more feasible by the recent decline in the share prices of streaming-video businesses like Netflix, according to a person familiar with the fund's strategy. In addition, Mr. Chapek has shown some willingness to proceed with a deal to buy out Comcast's stake and is seen as having a cordial relationship with Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts, this person said. Disney didn't respond to a request to comment on Mr. Chapek's willingness to do a deal for the remaining stake in Hulu or his relationship with Mr. Roberts.</p><p>\"We believe that it would even be prudent for Disney to pay a modest premium to accelerate the integration but are cognizant that the seller may have an unreasonable price expectation at this time,\" Mr. Loeb's letter says.</p><p>Disney and Comcast have been in a dispute over the value of Hulu, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. When Disney took majority control of Hulu in 2019, the service was valued at a minimum of $27.5 billion. Comcast in the past argued the value of Hulu is closer to $70 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. It isn't clear how much Comcast values Hulu now.</p><p>The two companies started to unwind some aspects of their partnership. Comcast's NBCUniversal this year exercised an option to exit its content-sharing agreement with Disney. Content from NBCUniversal that would have gone to Hulu after airing on NBC and NBC-owned cable channels will now go to Peacock, NBCU's streaming service.</p><p>Mr. Loeb's letter states there is a \"strong case to be made\" that Disney should spin off its ESPN business to shareholders to alleviate leverage at the parent, despite ESPN's centrality to the company's streaming offerings and the significant free cash flow it generates. Mr. Loeb suggests synergies between Disney and ESPN could be replicated through contractual arrangements. A spinoff would drive better long-term value for Disney shareholders and result in a business \"no longer haunted by the specter of cord-cutting,\" the letter says.</p><p>---</p><p>Dean Seal and Joe Flint contributed to this article.</p>",
