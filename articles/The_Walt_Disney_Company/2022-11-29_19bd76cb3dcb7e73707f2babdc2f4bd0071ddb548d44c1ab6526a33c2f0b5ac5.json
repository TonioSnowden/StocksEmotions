  "title": "AMC Networks to Lay Off 20% of U.S. Workers as CEO Christina Spade Exits; Company has been under pressure from cord-cutting as Americans turn to streaming services",
  "text": "<p>The planned job cuts come as AMC, which for the past 15 years has been home to many popular TV shows including \"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad,\" is struggling to generate enough money from its streaming services to make up for the continued decline of cable television, as Americans cancel their pay-TV packages in droves.</p><p>\"It was our belief that cord cutting losses would be offset by gains in streaming,\" AMC Chairman James Dolan said in an earlier memo to employees, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"This has not been the case.\"</p><p>Mr. Dolan said the board instructed AMC's executive leadership to undergo significant cutbacks in operations.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, AMC said CEO Christina Spade had stepped down. Ms. Spade, who the company said wasn't terminated for cause, didn't respond to a request for comment. The company said its board is finishing work to name a successor.</p><p>AMC Networks, whose brands include its namesake channel, as well as IFC, WE tv and Sundance TV, was among the many media companies that rode a wave of growth as cable TV was in its last lap of dominance in the media ecosystem. Its high-end, dark dramas—about zombies, ad executives in the 1960s, a high-school teacher turned meth kingpin—helped usher in an era of \"prestige\" TV.</p><p>But as a relative minnow surrounded by much larger media companies, AMC hasn't been in a strong position to compete against streaming giants such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Even big players such as Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Paramount Global, which have marshaled considerable resources to enter the streaming wars, have struggled to find a profitable path.</p><p>\"The mechanisms for the monetization of content are in disarray,\" Mr. Dolan said in his memo.</p><p>AMC isn't related to the theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Shares of AMC were down 3.7% in midday trading Tuesday. The stock has dropped by more than 40% so far this year.</p><p>Write to Jessica Toonkel at jessica.toonkel@wsj.com and Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>AMC Networks to Lay Off 20% of U.S. Workers as CEO Christina Spade Exits</p>",
