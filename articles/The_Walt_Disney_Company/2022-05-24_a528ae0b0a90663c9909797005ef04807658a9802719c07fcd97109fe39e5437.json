  "title": "'We Feed People' Review: Dinner With Friends; Ron Howard's film is a laudatory portrait of celebrity chef José Andrés and his World Central Kitchen, a program that brings food to those in crisis.",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Disney+</p><p>The director and the chef are apparently friends, and \"We Feed People,\" while not exactly a mash note, is a friend's take on one of the world's best-known food celebrities. Just to balance the dish he's serving up, Mr. Howard captures Mr. Andrés in a few awkward moments: The big-wheeled truck he's boasted about moments into the film, while churning through the floodwaters of Wilmington, N.C., gets stuck, and the rescue workers have to be rescued themselves. During what might be considered the second course of the movie, a frazzled Mr. Andrés bawls out a volunteer in the Hurricane Dorian-ravaged Bahamas and has to apologize—not just to the worker but to an indignant woman whom the worker has just fed. And, at the end of the film, he literally runs out of gas. The man able to implement emergency philanthropy at the drop of a hat—the day after the Russian invasion, WCK was reportedly feeding Ukrainians—simply forgot to fill the tank.</p><p>He would be the first to admit he isn't perfect, but there is something irreproachable, too, about Mr. Andrés, the consummate celebrity chef, who as a 21-year-old immigrated from Spain to New York, helped popularize small-plate dining in the U.S., became a renowned restaurateur in Washington, wrote \"Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America\" and made his way into the American pop-cultural mainstream though such shows as \"Iron Chef America,\" \"Top Chef\" and \"The Taste.\" Today, as he explains to Mr. Howard's camera, most of his time is devoted to WCK. \"We don't just feed people,\" he says early in the show, \"we create systems.\" The idea, he says, is to organize something \"that moves forward on its own.\" Inspired and modeled after the work of Robert Egger and his D.C. Central Kitchen, WCK is about practicalities, real-world stomachs and real-world effort. \"We give too much [money, in order] to feel good about ourselves,\" he says.</p><p>Inevitably, those with enough political power to alleviate the need for what Mr. Andrés is doing (a shot of Donald Trump throwing paper towels to a crowd in Puerto Rico is perhaps too on the nose) are going to balk. At one point during the film, Mr. Andrés is told that FEMA has accused him of using the Puerto Rico disaster to make millions, something echoed in the press and at a San Juan press conference. Mr. Andrés asks the Red Cross for financial help and is told (in a recorded phone conversation), \"We're not fundraising off this\"—meaning that the Puerto Rican hurricane disaster isn't attracting donations, so Mr. Andrés won't be getting any money. \"Chefs operate in chaos,\" says WCK's CEO Nate Mook (who sounds distractingly like Anderson Cooper), his point being that Mr. Andrés is a perfect fit for the job he's chosen. Mr. Howard's point is that no good deed goes uncriticized.</p><p>'We Feed People' Review: Dinner With Friends</p>",
