Who can forget the letter to Sotheby's comparing the auction house to “an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”?</p> <p>Just before the new year, Loeb disclosed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afa50509-afbc-4e7c-b57d-ac74ccbc6e6f\">a near-$1bn stake</a> in the US chipmaker <strong>Intel</strong>. He listed various reasons as to why the company had fallen behind its competitors in East Asia and aimed at its leadership.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Wednesday Intel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6e30aca-e72b-4c49-8e8a-1bb25918c5c4\">announced the departure</a> of its chief executive <strong>Bob Swan</strong>. Loeb had some kind parting words:</p> <p>The trickle of campaigns — Third Point at Intel and <strong>Disney </strong>and <strong>Trian Partners</strong> at<strong> Comcast</strong>, <strong>Invesco</strong> and <strong>Janus Henderson</strong> — is expected to turn into a flood by many activism defence advisers.&#xa0;</p> <p>Activists may have remained quiet for much of 2020 but they were busy loading up on shares. <strong>Paul Singer</strong>'s <strong>Elliott Management </strong>was by far the busiest among them last year with 16 new campaigns and $8.9bn put to work, according to a report by <strong>Lazard</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>As well as the old guard, companies have new activists to worry about. <strong>Engine No 1 </strong>had been around for just 10 days when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0639fb0-d81f-4ee9-8d58-d8e8da05c454\">launched a campaign</a> at <strong>ExxonMobil </strong>in December with the backing of large institutional investors. According to Lazard, newcomers launched almost one-third of campaigns last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are two lessons here: even small activists can shake things up at large companies with the right backing and environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, issues are becoming more important.</p> <p>But good old activism is still alive and well. Trian built its stakes in Invesco and Janus Henderson using money from a dedicated long-term fund aimed at spurring consolidation in the asset management industry. The Lazard report shows that mergers and acquisition is still the most common objective and advisers told DD it will take on more importance next year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Companies across the Atlantic should be on high alert, too.</p> <p>Businesses in the UK are among those most vulnerable to an activist attack. DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Peggy Hollinger and Laurence Fletcher reported earlier this month that funds are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86ab653e-380b-462e-8dbc-4e2bfb516504\">eyeing opportunities</a> in Britain's relatively weak stock market and pandemic-ravaged economy.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, Elliott is up to its old tricks in Germany.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has built a roughly 20 per cent stake in <strong>Rocket Internet</strong>, complicating matters for the German start-up factory which should never have been a public company and which its founders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54209904-c37d-4090-90c1-5133cb298515\">had been planning to delist</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's an evergreen theme for activists, and DD will be watching the scene closely.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Private equity's borrowing bender</h2> <p>It'll come as no surprise to DD regulars that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1caa7059-2e4e-4b9e-b365-8944478509a4\">M&amp;A activity surged</a> in the second half of last year despite the “slight” hiccup of a global pandemic.</p> <p>Part of that was thanks to private equity, which gained unprecedented access to cheap debt to fund new deals following the Federal Reserve's historic decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9a28bc0-66fb-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">cut US interest rates</a> to zero as part of sweeping measures to reboot the economy.</p> <p>Buyout firms played the coronavirus-induced low rate environment to their advantage, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1f44fe1-c784-46bc-9e55-e30921a4a8e5\">stacking business terms</a> in their favour and pilling on leverage to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9ff463b-01d7-4892-82dc-2dbb74941a16\"> pay themselves</a> dividends.</p> <p>And while some of the Fed's emergency facilities expired at the end of 2020, debt markets remain red-hot, spiralling private equity's borrowing binge even further.</p> <p><strong>BC Partners</strong> has borrowed $480m to fund its buyout of the healthcare provider <strong>Women's Care Florida</strong>, placing its debt at over nine times its ebitda margin.</p> <p><strong>Odyssey Investment Partners </strong>is employing a similar strategy, taking out loans totalling almost $600m to fund its purchase of personal protective equipment supplier <strong>Protective Industrial Products</strong>, which will leave the company over seven times leveraged.</p> <p>The enthusiasm for all of this debt has been disconcerting to some heavyweights in the investment world. Markets have catapulted “far ahead of the economic fundamentals”, as optimism over a vaccine-led rebound drove US stocks to record highs earlier this month, <strong>Oaktree Capital </strong>founder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8290cfe4-58bc-32c2-bff8-f71fbf98fb6b\">Howard Marks</a> told DD's Eric Platt in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5585b123-7b9d-40fe-8f63-95f7491e8193\">interview</a>.</p> <h2>A former Disney exec and a Murdoch take on India</h2> <p>With hindsight, Walt Disney executives may somewhat rue paying a hefty $71bn for most of <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong>'s <strong>21st Century Fox</strong> empire in 2019.</p> <p>But one part of that business that has proved its worth is Disney's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99438da6-9156-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0\">subsidiary in India</a>, <strong>Star</strong>, which has been an invaluable platform in helping the <strong>Disney Plus Hotstar</strong> streaming service amass tens of millions of subscribers.</p> <p><strong>Uday Shankar</strong>, one of the masterminds behind Star's turnround during the Murdoch years, left his Disney job last month, where he was overseeing its business in Asia-Pacific. His first move as a free agent has been to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b65a81b5-6491-4357-b584-d77b7304d015\">team up</a> with <strong>James Murdoch</strong>, his old boss at Star, and <strong>Lupa Systems</strong>, the holding company borne out of Murdoch's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4aa76d46-d18f-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\">$2bn windfall</a> from the Fox sale.</p> <p>The younger Murdoch says their new unnamed venture will not “try to replicate” what he and Shankar achieved at Star, which went from being a sleepy, struggling television channel to the country's pre-eminent media group and sports broadcaster.</p> <p>Much of the detail has still to be fleshed out and will be defined in part by the acquisition opportunities that arise. But the ambitions are notable: to establish a “large scale” operation in the areas of digital media, education and healthcare provision. It will be centred on India, but pursuing opportunities across the region.</p> <p>“We are doing something that has a broad scope . . . in the context of just extraordinary mobile connectivity,” Murdoch said. “It's a great moment to start something with a blank sheet of paper.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Renaissance Technologies</strong> founder <strong>Jim Simons </strong>has named the hedge fund's chief executive <strong>Peter Brown</strong> as sole chairman.
