  "text": "<p>Cassidy Hutchinson, a 25-year-old junior former White House aide, yesterday<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e729df8-cd60-409a-8d72-b49c23b712ba\"> delivered the most methodical inside account</a> yet of Donald Trump's mood, actions and intentions in the run-up to last year's attack on the US Capitol.</p> <p>In her testimony Hutchinson showed how Trump not only fuelled the mob and the attempted insurrection, but wanted to join it, disregarding the risk of violence.</p> <p>In one of the most disturbing passages of testimony, Hutchison gave details of an altercation between the former president and a Secret Service agent named Robert Engel inside the presidential vehicle that was relayed to her by Tony Ornato, the deputy chief of staff and the liaison with the Secret Service. </p> <p>Hutchinson testified that Trump had wanted to join the rioters as they moved to storm the halls of Congress and overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p> <p>However, he was stopped by the Secret Service, according to Hutchinson, leading to an altercation inside the presidential vehicle in which Trump tried to grab the steering wheel.</p> <p>“Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel,” the agent told the president as he tried to take control of the armoured black presidential SUV.</p> <p>Trump was subsequently taken to the White House by security staff as the riot unfolded and was forced to watch the events on television.</p> <p>Yesterday's hearing was abruptly called by the committee investigating the January 6 riots. Hutchinson was an aide to Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff. She had previously testified to the committee in private and parts of her deposition were aired during a hearing last week. </p> <p>In a sign of his nervousness about Hutchinson's testimony, Trump went on the attack on his Truth Social platform yesterday afternoon, accusing her of telling a “fake story” about the steering wheel and claiming she was known for being a “phoney” and a “leaker”.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
