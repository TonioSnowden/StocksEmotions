  "text": "<p>\n  Streaming gets another dose of nostalgia this week as an '80s-era cartoon gets a remake targeted at parents and their kids, and an amusement-park ride becomes a movie. There's also a love story. Here's where to find it all: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New Release: </p><p>\n  'The Pursuit of Love' </p><p>\n  (Amazon Prime Video) </p><p>\n   This three-part British miniseries based on Nancy Mitford's 1945 novel is the directorial debut for actress Emily Mortimer, who also wrote the screenplay. Ms. Mortimer says that reading the book as a teenager, she was swept up in the love stories that populate the lives of its English heroines: the free-spirited Linda Radlett (Lily James) and her more traditional cousin and best friend Fanny Logan (Emily Beecham). Reading the book as a middle-aged woman and mother, however, she says she found Mitford's treatment of taboo subjects like bad parenting radical and relatable. </p><p>\n  \"I felt very spoken to reading it both as a teenager and again as a middle-aged woman,\" she says. \"I wanted to find ways of it feeling like it wasn't just about girls that lived in another era, but it was about girls that live in any era.\" </p><p>\n  Though the story of \"The Pursuit of Love,\" takes place in the 1930s and '40s, Ms. Mortimer infused the series with a rock 'n' roll soundtrack -- New Order, the Who, Sleater-Kinney -- and other flourishes to give it the timeless tone she feels in the book's pages. Though she sometimes wondered if she was pushing things too far, Ms. Mortimer says her moments of doubt were silenced when her instincts were confirmed. When she reached out to Marianne Faithfull to ask if she could use her song \"Give My Love to London,\" she got a note back from Ms. Faithfull saying \"The Pursuit of Love\" was her favorite book. </p><p>\n  \"I thought, OK, well, I'm not wrong,\" Ms. Mortimer says. \"If it's Marianne Faithfull's favorite novel, then maybe it does have a bit of a punk-rock soul.\" </p><p>\n  The series premieres Friday on Amazon Prime Video. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New Release: 'Masters of the Universe: Revelation' </p><p>\n  (Netflix) </p><p>\n  Kevin Smith is the showrunner for \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation,\" now streaming on Netflix, a reboot of the 1980s animated series populated with heroes and villains like He-Man and Skeletor. Here, he explains the marching orders he gave his writers. Edited from an interview: </p><p>\n  \"After I put together the writers' room for 'Masters of the Universe: Revelation,' the first thing I did was tell the story of going to see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' with my father, the day that it came out back in 1981. </p><p>\n  My father was beside himself watching the movie, constantly turning to me, excitedly saying something like, 'This is the kind of movie that I used to see when I was a kid. They called them cliffhangers! This is incredible!' I got to see the boy at the heart of the man. </p><p>\n  I told the writers: We're going to have a bunch of parents sitting down with their kids going: 'This is what I watched when I was little, watch it with me.' I said: Let's just make this whole series, like, Hey, your toys are exactly where you left them and they're ready to be played with again, except now you're just a little bit more grown up.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  New Release: 'Jungle Cruise' </p><p>\n  (Disney+) </p><p>\n  Jesse Plemons co-stars in \"Jungle Cruise,\" an adventure film out Friday on Disney+ (for an added fee). The story follows Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt), who is on the Amazon searching for a tree with healing powers and enlists skipper (Dwayne Johnson) to help her find it. </p><p>\n  Mr. Plemons, best known for making decidedly not family-friendly fare, such as Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman,\" says one of the reasons he took the job was because it was so different than anything else he'd made. Another was that he was about to become a dad. </p><p>\n  \"It felt like nice timing to do something that [my son] could potentially watch sooner than a lot of the other stuff that I had done,\" he says. </p><p></p>",
