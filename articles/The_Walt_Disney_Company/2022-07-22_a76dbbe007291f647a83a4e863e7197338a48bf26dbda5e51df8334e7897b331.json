  "title": "Here's everything new coming to HBO Max in August 2022; The 'Game of Thrones' prequel 'House of the Dragon' and a new season of 'Industry' are the month's highlights",
  "text": "<p>With a sprawling cast that includes Matt Smith, Emma D'Arcy, Paddy Considine, Olivia Cooke and Milly Alcock, the new series takes place 200 years before the events of \"Game of Thrones,\" and details a war of succession that tears apart the Targaryen dynasty. It's based on George R.R. Martin's book \"Fire &amp; Blood,\" and has a production cost higher than the original series (dragons don't come cheap, you know). It's the first of many planned \"Game of Thrones\" spinoffs by HBO, so get ready for much more to come.</p><p>Also see: What's coming in August to Netflix | Hulu | Disney+</p><p>Warner Bros.
