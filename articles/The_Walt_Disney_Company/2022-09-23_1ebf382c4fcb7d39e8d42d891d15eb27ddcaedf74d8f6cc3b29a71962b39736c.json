  "title": "Aaron Judge looks to break American League home-run record — and then get the Yankees to break the bank; Judge hit his 60th home run of the season Tuesday, tying Babe Ruth's home-run total from 1927. Roger Maris, like Ruth and Judge a New York Yankee, hit 61 in 1961.",

But despite Judge's stellar career and standout 2022 season — he's led the Yankees to the second best record in the league and baseball's sixth best and has a very realistic shot at winning baseball's first triple crown since Miguel Cabrera's in 2012 (which, in turn, was the first since those of Carl Yastrzemski and Frank Robinson in the mid-1960s) — he has not yet truly cashed in.</p><p>In his seven seasons as a big leaguer, Judge has racked up just $36 million in contract earnings, according to Spotrac, for a career average annual salary of $5.14 million, not appreciably higher than the game's current average of $4.4 million. One reason is that Judge debuted with the Yankees in 2017 at a more advanced age, 25, than the typical rookie, pushing back the age at which Judge would first qualify for free agency. Judge is the 57th highest paid player this season at $19 million.</p><p>Judge, with his career .284 batting average and 218 career home runs (an average of 49 per 162 games), is set to capitalize on his accomplishments after this season, when he will be an unrestricted free agent and able to sign with any team for any amount of money that he and his agent can negotiate. Judge turned down a seven-year, $213.5 million extension before this season, according to Yankees President Brian Cashman, in hopes of earning more in free agency.</p><p>See also: MLB agent Scott Boras will make more money than almost every professional baseball player</p><p>Judge should be poised to earn hundreds of millions of dollars on a new contract, whether it's from the Yankees or another team, in the offseason.</p><p>But if Judge arguably has been underpaid, he did have the largest number of endorsements in baseball last season, according to sports and entertainment data platform SponsorUnited. Judge has endorsement deals with T-Mobile TMUS, Disney's DIS Hulu, Pepsi PEP, Adidas XE:ADS ADDYY, Oakley and JBL.</p><p>See also: Serena Williams lost at the U.S. Open — but here's why she's not done winning</p><p>The Yankees next play on Friday night against the Boston Red Sox, and the game can only be viewed on the Apple TV+ subscription service.</p><p>Read on: The Mets, owned by hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, now have the highest payroll in baseball: $273.9 million</p><p>Aaron Judge looks to break American League home-run record — and then get the Yankees to break the bank</p>",
