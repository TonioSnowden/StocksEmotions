  "text": "<p>   A firm led by two former Walt Disney Co. executives has agreed to buy a stake in Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith's media company, people familiar with the matter said, the latest in a series of high-profile acquisitions for the Blackstone Inc.-backed entertainment venture. </p><p>   The Blackstone-backed firm, which has yet to announce a name for itself and is run by former Disney executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, is paying about $60 million to acquire more than 10% of Westbrook Inc., the people said. </p><p>   Founded in 2019, Westbrook's projects include \"King Richard,\" a biopic that chronicles the life of Richard Williams, the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. Other projects from Westbrook include the \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" reunion on HBO Max, \"Red Table Talk,\" a show on Facebook Watch featuring Ms. Pinkett Smith, her daughter Willow Smith and her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris. </p><p>   The Westbrook deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions in recent months for Messrs. Mayer and Staggs's venture. </p><p>   In November, the firm said it was buying Moonbug Entertainment Ltd., the company behind hit children's shows \"CoComelon\" and \"Blippi,\" for about $3 billion. In August, it said it was spending $900 million to acquire Hello Sunshine, the media company founded by Reese Witherspoon. </p><p>   Mr. Mayer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in August that he and Mr. Staggs were creating a new entertainment company for Hollywood's streaming era. Some media companies are reluctant to license shows and movies to rivals, Mr. Mayer said, creating an opportunity for a new independent player. </p><p></p>",
