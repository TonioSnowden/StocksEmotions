  "title": "Disney's Earnings Report to Give Insight on Disney+'s Push to Profitability; Company sees streaming becoming profitable by September 2024; analysts see Disney+ service adding 8.8 million members in fourth quarter",
  "text": "<p>Since then, Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek has indicated that Disney+, the company's flagship streaming service, is entering a new phase that focuses less on subscriber growth and more on profitability. Since Disney+ launched three years ago, Disney's streaming segment has lost more than $7 billion. The company has said it foresees Disney+ turning a profit by September 2024.</p><p>Wall Street observers, however, predict that Tuesday's results will reflect that the company is still transitioning to that focus on profit.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet estimate that Disney+ added 8.8 million net new subscribers in the most recent quarter, to bring its total to 161 million, but that average monthly revenue per user of the service fell by a dime to $4.30.</p><p>Disney's overall revenue for the quarter is expected to be $21.3 billion, slightly lower than the previous quarter and up from $18.5 billion in the year-earlier quarter, according to FactSet estimates.</p><p>Analysts expect Disney's overall operating income to fall 36% from the prior quarter to $2.3 billion. Most of this decline is expected to come from the division that includes the direct-to-consumer streaming business, which analysts polled by FactSet predict will lose more than $1 billion.</p><p>Sales from Disney's parks division for the full 2022 fiscal year, which ended in September, are expected to total $22.9 billion, or more than twice the full year total from the previous year. Compared with the previous quarter, analysts expect sales to decline by about 7% in the division.</p><p>As the streaming industry matures, most companies are raising prices, including Disney, which will introduce price increases on certain subscription packages in December. The company is also launching an ad-supported tier of Disney+, which will compete with a similar product launched by rival Netflix Inc. this month.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Disney? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Streaming is a critical mass business. Scale is really, really important in order to be able to thrive,\" Mr. Chapek said last month at The Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. In the future, consolidation will lead to fewer streaming services and force companies like Disney to offer more services through their streaming platforms, he added.</p><p>This month, Disney launched a test program that placed links inside the Disney+ app allowing users to buy exclusive merchandise related to Star Wars, Marvel Studios and other popular franchises the company owns.</p><p>Some Disney-watchers say the company faces a difficult balancing act between spending enough money on popular shows and movies to attract new subscribers, finding the right pricing point for dozens of different markets and reining in costs so streaming can break even.</p><p>Since the spring, shares of media companies that rely on streaming have tumbled across the board, as investors have grown more pessimistic about the prospects of near-term profitability for streaming. Disney's shares are down 35% since the start of the year.</p><p>\"The halcyon days of total growth and number of subscribers, those days are over,\" said Chris Legg, senior managing director at investment bank Progress Partners, which advises companies in the media and advertising technology space.</p><p>\"Disney is still in the mind-set of go-and-grab more subscribers, whether it's locally or internationally. They probably have a few quarters to keep playing that game, but Wall Street is definitely getting less patient with this spend-for-subs model,\" said Mr. Legg.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney's Earnings Report to Give Insight on Disney+'s Push to Profitability</p>",
