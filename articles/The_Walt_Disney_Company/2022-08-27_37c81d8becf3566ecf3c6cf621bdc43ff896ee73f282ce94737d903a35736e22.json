  "text": "<p>Simon &amp; Schuster, 300 pages, $28.99</p><p>Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt rarely spoke ill of his close rivals. Not that he had all that many of them. By the early 1870s he was the richest American, owner of the mighty New York Central and a bundle of other railroad lines.</p><p>But in 1872 a reporter, who had heard that Vanderbilt was not fond of one of his fellow financiers, asked if this was true. Vanderbilt temporized: \"I have had but one business transaction with him in my life. In July, 1868, I sold him some stock for which he paid me promptly.\"</p><p>The reporter pressed on. \"Why then do you distrust him?\" One evasion was enough for the Commodore. \"His face, sir. No man could have such a countenance and still be honest.\"</p><p>\"But surely Mr. Vanderbilt, you must have some other reason . . .\"</p><p>\"I tell you, God Almighty has stamped every man's character upon his face. I read Mr. Gould like an open book the first time I saw him. You have my authority for stating that I consider Mr. Jay Gould a damned villain.\"</p><p>That the Commodore had once said the same villain was \"the smartest man in America\" did not sweeten his opinion. Nor have the succeeding decades been much kinder to Gould.</p><p>A century ago, when the industrialists often called the Robber Barons were still a controversial presence in the national mind, rather than a mere fixture in the dim pageant of a vanished era, Jay Gould was seen as the most malevolent of them all. Probably his looks did have something to do with this: Gould was a sallow wisp of a man who stood just over 5 feet tall, dressed like an undertaker and usually kept his mouth shut.</p><p>But this little \"spider,\" to choose one of the hundred epithets spat at him in his day (that particular swipe is from Henry Adams), could, at his whim, devastate vast commercial empires and bring continentwide railroad systems to ruin.</p><p>Now we can judge him for ourselves, thanks to Greg Steinmetz's lively, succinct, altogether admirable biography, \"American Rascal,\" whose fair-mindedness never dims the pleasure of a speedy narrative. Mr. Steinmetz, a former editor at the Journal, reveals something surprising or shocking on nearly every page. Mark Twain wrote: \"The gospel left behind by Jay Gould is doing giant work. Its message is get money. Get it quickly. Get it in abundance. Get it in prodigious amounts. Get it dishonestly if you can, honestly if you must.\"</p><p>Gould would not have disagreed. When he was 17 he told a friend: \"I'm going to be rich. I've seen enough to realize what can be accomplished by means of riches, and I tell you I'm going to be rich.\" Rich he certainly became. But Twain was right about the \"giant work\" too.</p><p>Gould was tireless, and, from the beginning, the work he chose had nothing to do with such menial tasks as shop-sweeping or fence-mending. He taught himself to be a surveyor and carried his equipment through chest-high snow to plot out his neighbors' properties. \"He was made of steel and rubber,\" a friend later said.</p><p>He was born, following a squadron of six sisters, in 1836 to a Roxbury, N.Y., farming family. His mother died when he was 4; all he remembered of her was the chill of her lips when he kissed her corpse. She is said to have had a fine head for figures, which she passed to her boy, and a love of flowers, especially roses and hyacinths. Years later her son owned an estate with the largest glass-enclosed conservatory in the nation and filled it with roses and hyacinths. This seems to be the only sentimental gesture ever ascribed to him.</p><p>By his early 20s he was the owner of a profitable leather tannery, and very much a hands-on operator. It was disagreeable work -- tanneries emitted an eye-watering stench in every kind of weather -- and could be violent. He once had to solve an ownership dispute by raising a group of armed volunteers and retaking his tannery under gunfire. At about that time he said: \"I want to gain a grasp of the bartering [because] I've come to realize that it is the merchants who command the true power. The brokers take what seems the smallest share but is in fact the largest. Theirs is nearly pure profit made on the backs of the shippers and tanners, never their hands dirtied.\"</p><p>Mr. Steinmetz shows how he found his instrument to do this: the railroads. He pried his way into ownership of the Rutland &amp; Washington in 1863, and became manager of the Rensselaer &amp; Saratoga the same year (he was 2 inches shy of the Union Army's height requirement, so war service was never an inconvenience).</p><p>By 1868 Gould was ready to take on Vanderbilt. The Commodore owned the Central; Gould went after its rival, the Erie, in partnership with James Fisk Jr. \"Jubilee Jim\" was the anti-Gould: loud, flashy and always thirsting for attention.</p><p>\"Thus began the Erie War,\" Mr. Steinmetz writes, \"a gigantic struggle that revealed Wall Street at its worst, rattled faith in unfettered capitalism, and triggered the country's first calls for progressive reform.\" It introduced Gould to the national public even as it tarnished his reputation.</p><p>Gould had already mastered the bear raid -- sell a company's stock short, put out a spate of rumors about its imminent bankruptcy, and, after the stock crashes, pick up the majority at fire-sale rates. When that ploy proved insufficient to maintain control over the Erie, Gould and Fisk set up shop in a Jersey City hotel beyond the reach of Vanderbilt's bought New York state legislators, mounted a couple of field guns on the roof, and began printing fresh Erie shares beneath it. Meanwhile, Gould quietly circulated through the Albany statehouse encouraging congressmen to help themselves from the fat satchel of cash he was carrying.</p><p>When it was over, Gould had not only won, but had taken $9 million from the Erie treasury.</p><p>A few years later Fisk died, shot on a Manhattan hotel staircase by a lover of his mistress. How many of Gould's subsequent collaborators would fare can be seen in the ruin of his partner Henry Smith, who went bankrupt over the Chicago &amp; Northwestern. After Gould came out millions of dollars ahead in the same deal, Smith accosted him: \"I will live to see the day, sir, when you have to earn a living by going around this street with a hand organ and a monkey!\" Gould responded: \"Maybe you will, Henry, maybe you will. And when I want a monkey, Henry, I'll send for you.\"</p><p>Gould went on from victory to victory. By 1881, 115,000 miles of railroad track had been spiked down in the U.S. One mile of every six belonged to Jay Gould.</p><p>He was the most reclusive of plutocrats, shading himself from the glare of publicity. In 1863 he married 23-year-old Ellen Miller, the daughter of a leading Manhattan merchant. He came home to her every evening. \"I have the disadvantage of not being sociable,\" he said in a rare moment of speaking about himself. \"Every man has natural inclinations of his own. Mine are domestic. They are not calculated to make me particularly popular on Wall Street, and I cannot help that.\"</p><p>In the end, his slight body could not sustain the voracious spirit that inhabited it. He died of tuberculosis, at the age of 56, in 1892, leaving a fortune of $77 million -- $79 billion in today's dollars. At his wish, his mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery has no name on it.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Snow is the author, most recently, of \"Disney's Land: Walt Disney and the Invention of the Amusement Park That Changed the World.\"</p>",
