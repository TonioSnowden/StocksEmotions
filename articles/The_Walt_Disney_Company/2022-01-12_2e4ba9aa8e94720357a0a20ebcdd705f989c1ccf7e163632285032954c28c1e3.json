According to the NFL, the Cowboys were featured in five of the 10 most-watched games this season, including a Thanksgiving matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders on CBS that averaged nearly 41 million viewers and was the biggest game of the season in terms of ratings.</p><p>Ratings were also lifted by several close, competitive games and the parity among teams, with many in contention for postseason play late into the season. A record 34 games were decided on the final play, according to the league. Overall, 64% of all games were competitive in the fourth quarter, the league said.</p><p>Among the TV rights holders, NBC's regular-season package of mostly Sunday night games averaged 19.3 million viewers across all platforms, up 11% from the previous season.</p><p>Fox Corp.'s Sunday afternoon NFL national and regional coverage averaged 18.6 million viewers, a 2% increase from last season.
