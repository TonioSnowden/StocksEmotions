  "text": "<p>What would Reed Hastings do if he ran a news publication instead of Netflix?</p> <p>The website technology would almost certainly be better. There might be no advertising; much like the Netflix streaming service, the Daily Hastings would be a subscription-funded enterprise.&#xa0;</p> <p>Facing a massive commercial challenge to its core business, Hastings would probably resist the urge to invest in adjacent sectors, such as events or ecommerce. More money would go into the newsroom instead.</p> <p>But Hastings' most distinctive mark might be over something more prosaic: price. News executives say that when they talk with Hastings, he points out the subscriptions they are selling are just too expensive. Coming from a man who has built a digital media company with more than 200m subscribers, this might be advice worth reflecting on.&#xa0;</p> <p>News executives see subscriptions as a path to redemption after years of trauma over declining print and advertising revenue. But the high prices are also a reminder of the distance this industry still needs to travel in the search for a sustainable, and genuinely scalable, digital business model.</p> <p>About $27 in the US, for example, buys monthly digital access to Netflix, Disney Plus, and Spotify's library of <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/spotify-now-hosts-70-million-songs-but-it-cant-keep-that-up-forever-1094234/\">70m recorded songs</a>. For that sum, it is possible to subscribe to one of these news sites: the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times or The Times of London. But not more than one. </p> <p>There are of course differences of approach. Some titles — such as Le Monde and the Washington Post — are trying subscriptions for roughly $10. Others like the New York Times heavily discount introductory rates. More specialist publications, such as the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and Bloomberg, charge high prices with confidence in their use for business. </p> <p>But whatever the approach, there is no doubt the value comparison with other types of media — for example on content investment per dollar of subscription — is still a humbling one for publishers. </p> <p>Netflix is projected <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-2020-content-spending-17-billion-1203469237/\">to spend $17bn on content</a> this year. That alone is easily enough to pay for every newsroom in America, possibly twice over (<a href=\"https://mediaoutlook.pwc.com\">PwC estimated</a> news publishers will generate $22bn in revenue this year, and a fraction of that is spent on journalism). </p> <p>Subscription revenue has been a godsend in coping with the decline of print and advertising. But some publishers have largely relied on super fans and loyalists who feel an affinity with the brand and want to support its mission, even at a high price point. Donald Trump helped drive a lot of news philanthropy. </p> <p>The Guardian is a case in point: it began asking for voluntary contributions in 2016 and now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2020/dec/17/guardian-sees-digital-reader-support-grow-by-43-in-a-year\">more than 900,000 “supporters”</a> and app subscribers, mostly contributing at least £5 a month.</p> <p>As an investment proposition, news content is clearly different from shows on Netflix or songs on Spotify. It often does not travel beyond a local audience, and is highly perishable. That has fed a defensive mindset in the industry. The priority for most publishers has been cost control, and generating digital revenue from a base of loyal readers.</p> <p>More than a decade since the first paywalls were erected, just a handful of publishers have attracted more than 1m paying readers. And most subscribers only pay for one publication.</p> <p>Hastings' playbook for digital subscription businesses such as Netflix was totally different: ploughing money into technology and the quality of content, while adopting aggressive pricing to build a mass audience around the world. </p> <p>The New York Times (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/business/media/new-york-times-earnings.html\">5m digital news subscriptions</a>) and Washington Post (<a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/washington-post-plans-to-grow-newsroom-to-record-size-1000-journalists-in-2021-after-hitting-digital-ad-and-subscription-peaks/\">almost 3m</a>) are leading a more ambitious phase of expansion. Both newsrooms are more than a third bigger than their print heyday, and the New York Times thinks it can eventually take the big share of a potential audience of 100m readers.</p> <p>For that kind of scale, still more investment may be needed. Smaller, reader-funded general news titles also face hard choices on what kind of newsroom and mission they need to serve their desired digital audience. </p> <p>Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of Oxford university's Reuters Institute, described them as fighting for survival “in the most competitive battle for attention we've seen in human history”. While the journalism business likes to cast itself as full of hard-boiled realists, he doubted publishers “have really grasped the enormity of that challenge”.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:alex.barker@ft.com\"><em>alex.barker@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Alex Barker in London 2021 'What news publishers can learn from Netflix' FT.com 18 March.
