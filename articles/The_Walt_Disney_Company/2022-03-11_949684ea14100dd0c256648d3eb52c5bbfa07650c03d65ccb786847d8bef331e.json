Ron DeSantis he was concerned about the bill's potential consequences for LGBTQ children.</p><p>In his note Friday, Chapek said Disney was increasing its support for advocacy groups to fight similar legislation in other states and that it would create a new structure for political giving “that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/WaltDisneyCo/status/1502377943267381249More on Disney: Disney suspends all business in Russia</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>Top stories at WSJ.com</p><p>Endurance, Ernest Shackleton's Lost Ship, Found in Antarctica After 107 Years</p><p>Behold, the New Starting Salary for Some Graduates Is $100,000</p>",
