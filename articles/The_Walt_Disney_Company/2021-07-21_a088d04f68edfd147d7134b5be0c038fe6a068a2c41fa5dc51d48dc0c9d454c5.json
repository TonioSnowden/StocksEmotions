  "text": "<p>In Oklahoma, Martin Scorsese is filming the drama \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" California's program attracted Netflix's psychological thriller series \"You,\" along with HBO's \"Westworld.\"</p><p>\"With the demand for content, it's the perfect time to be where we are,\" said Tava Maloy-Sofsky, director of the Oklahoma Film and Music Bureau.</p><p>While the pandemic shut down a lot of film production, rising vaccination rates and lowering Covid-19 case counts means movie making is back. Also, a multitude of streaming services that became popular during the pandemic are working to make as many new shows as possible.</p><p>Some production teams decamped to states that were less restrictive about gathering during the pandemic, and those municipal leaders want to keep the economic boost flowing. Others are reupping prior programs and seeing the opportunity in the streaming boom's demand for space to film.</p><p>In Oklahoma, lawmakers in May more than tripled the cash rebates offered to productions such as the coming Matt Damon film \"Stillwater.\"</p><p>California lawmakers, meanwhile, voted Thursday to approve a bill that would offer studios state tax credits for constructing soundstages as well as efforts to boost film and TV diversity.</p><p>In March 2021, the Kentucky Legislature revived its tax-credit program after closing it to new applicants in 2018 during a budget crunch. In May, the Montana governor signed an amendment to raise the film tax-credit cap by an additional $2 million. And in Oregon, a new bill increased the cap on one of the state's credit programs from $14 million to $20 million in total.</p><p>Many of the states expanding their film programs are hoping to replicate the success of Georgia, which has experienced a surge in production since offering a tax credit of as much as 30%. Today, Walt Disney Co. spectacles, such as \"Avengers: Endgame,\" regularly film there and have contributed to a deep bench of local crew workers and soundstage inventory that shows little sign of slowing.</p><p>But newer state entrants have a long way to go.</p><p>In Oklahoma, 33 film and TV productions have qualified for the state's cash rebate this fiscal year. A Kentucky Film Office report found that the program gave an average of about $8.9 million annually in tax credits from 2015 to 2018. Both state programs remain relatively small compared with California or Georgia, where dozens of movies and TV shows were filmed in 2019 alone.</p><p>\"This business is risky,\" said Vans Stevenson, the senior vice president of state government affairs at the Motion Picture Association. \"There's a ton of competition. Nobody knows if a movie, television or streaming series is going to find an audience or not. Production finance is crucial, and being able to save as much money or reduce your production costs is a huge factor.\"</p><p>Montana Studios Chief Executive Steve Grover, who has lobbied in support of the state's program since 2017, said Montana needed to develop the infrastructure to support its film industry if a tax-credit program was going to be successful. Mr. Grover added that constructing additional soundstages -- soundproof buildings that film crews use for shooting -- is a key step in doing so.</p><p>In January 2020, local studio Shadowcast Partners bought a vacant complex to convert into a $19.1 million film complex that was to include three 20,000-square-foot soundstages, offices, interior filming rooms and apartments and condos for employees. But after Montana legislators passed a lower-than-expected increase to the film tax-credit cap, county commissioners stepped back from the plans.</p><p>---</p><p>Erich Schwartzel contributed to this article.</p>",
