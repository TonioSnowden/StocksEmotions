  "text": "<p>But 2022 grosses are still off by roughly one-third compared with 2019, the last prepandemic year, when the total North American box office totaled $11 billion. The main issue, according to studio executives and industry observers, is lack of supply—fewer big movies means fewer tickets sold. Another factor is consumers' appetite for moviegoing given the growth of streaming and persistent Covid-19 concerns.</p><p>Production hangovers from the pandemic, which prolonged shooting schedules and overtaxed contractors who provide many of the visual effects and other services for big studios, led to major delays and limited how much time distributors had to promote finished movies to audiences. \"We're still coming out of the Covid haze,\" said Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures, whose \"Top Gun: Maverick\" proved the biggest hit of the year, taking in $719 million domestically and $1.49 billion worldwide. \"There are a couple of films that we barely got to the finish line.\" One of those was \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2,\" Mr. Robbins said. The combination live-action and animated family movie, released in the U.S. in April, went on to gross $191 million in North America, the highest-ever domestic box office total for a movie based on a videogame, and $403 million overall.</p><p>Paramount also pushed back the release date of \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,\" a sequel in its successful sci-fi action franchise based on the popular children's toys, from 2022 to 2023 because of supply-chain issues, he said. </p><p>Some 71 movies were given wide release in North America in 2022, compared with 110 in 2019.

Total domestic box office gross from Friday to Sunday was $86 million, Comscore said, down 69% from last year's holiday weekend haul, when Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios' \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" the highest-grossing film of the pandemic, was in its second weekend. \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" from Walt Disney Co.'s 20th Century Studios, represented $56 million of the weekend total. Some 71 movies were given wide release in North America in 2022, Comscore said, with an average domestic box office gross of $102 million. That is compared with 2019, when 110 wide-release films earned an average of $99 million apiece in ticket sales. \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" the Tom Cruise-led fighter-pilot drama and sequel to the patriotic 1986 action blockbuster, was the highest-grossing movie of 2022.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What was your favorite movie to see in theaters this year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Disney-owned studios had four of the top-ten movies of the year through Christmas, measured by domestic box office gross, with Marvel Studios' \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" ($427 million),\" \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" ($411 million), \"Thor: Love and Thunder\" ($343 million) and 20th Century Studios' \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" ($254 million). Disney—including its 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures subsidiaries—took the top spot among distributors with $1.84 billion domestically through Christmas, according to Comscore, although two big Disney titles, the \"Avatar\" and \"Black Panther\" sequels, remain in theaters through the holidays and are expected to add to their box office totals over the next week.</p><p>Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures took the No. 2 spot and was the most prolific studio of 2022 to date. Universal gave wide release to 36 movies that earned $1.6 billion domestically, led by \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" ($376 million) and \"Minions: The Rise of Gru\" ($369 million).</p><p>Universal was followed by Paramount ($1.3 billion), Warner Bros. Pictures ($934 million), and Sony ($854 million). Warner Bros.' total, which came from just nine wide-release titles, was driven largely by two movies in the domestic top 10, the superhero epics \"The Batman\" ($369 million) and \"Black Adam\" ($168 million).</p><p>Movies based on established franchises like the dinosaurs of \"Jurassic Park\" or the chattering yellow minions of \"Despicable Me,\" are still proving the most reliable moneymakers, but genre films like romantic comedies and horror movies are still performing well, especially if they star A-list talent, said Jim Orr, president of domestic theatrical distribution at Universal. He points to Universal's \"Ticket to Paradise,\" a Julia Roberts and George Clooney-led wedding comedy that came out in September and grossed $68 million domestically and $167 million globally. \"That's a demo that people think is harder to get to the theaters, but people will still show up to see two fantastic movie stars with a really fun concept,\" he said.</p><p>Big movie studios are still adjusting to the rise of streaming video, which grew meteorically during the pandemic while theaters were closed and audiences were spending more of their leisure time at home on their couches.</p><p>Some production companies, including Disney's Pixar Animation Studios and Hulu, sent titles that might have generated strong sales at the box office straight to streaming without theatrical release, including Pixar's \"Turning Red\" and Hulu's \"Prey,\" part of the \"Predator\" sci-fi franchise.</p><p>Netflix Inc., the leading streaming platform in terms of subscriber numbers, kept some of its biggest movies, like \"The Grey Man\" and \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,\" out of theaters altogether or gave them only a minimal theatrical release.</p><p>And Warner Bros. scrapped \"Batgirl,\" and its latest Scooby-Doo movie altogether, citing budget concerns and poor testing with audiences.</p><p>\"A lighter overall slate of films combined with a lack of uniformity of movie releases along the timeline of the calendar year made it tough for the marketplace to build up a consistent head of steam in 2022,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"The outlook for 2023 is much brighter, with a solid lineup of films spaced evenly month after month, reflecting a much more normalized release slate,\" he said. \"That's good news for theater owners around the globe.\"</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Hits Like 'Top Gun: Maverick' Buoyed 2022 Movie Box Office, to a Point</p>",
