  "text": "<p>And lingering worries about Covid-19 exposure and disruptions add to the stress, psychologists say.</p><p>how to destress this summer</p><p>* One Simple Thing You Can Do to Relax</p><p>Some 27% of travelers reported \"more than moderate\" anxiety about the virus on a recent trip, according to a May survey from market-research firm Destination Analysts, up from 19% of travelers surveyed the month prior, a shift that loosely tracks the rise of the BA.5 virus variant.</p><p>The heightened anxiety can in some cases cancel out the benefits of vacations. Here are some strategies that psychologists recommend to get the most out of your next trip.</p><p>Pick the right kind of trip</p><p>The ideal stress-reducing trip breaks our everyday routine but isn't so far outside our comfort zone that it feels scary, says Lynn Bufka, a psychologist who focuses on anxiety and stress.</p><p>Giving your brain a change from its normal routine will allow you to derive longer-lasting psychological benefits, says Dr. Bufka, who works at the American Psychological Association. For most of us, that means doing something memorable. We probably won't remember watching Netflix in a hotel room, but memories of a satisfying hike or a thrilling trip to the top of the Eiffel Tower can help carry us through stressful times in our day-to-day lives back home.</p><p>\"What we take from vacations are memories and experiences that give us a little escape when we're overwhelmed,\" she says. \"It's less about, 'I bought this,' and more about, 'I saw the world differently.' \"</p><p>Ignore expectations</p><p>Avoid deferring to what you think you should be doing and plan a vacation that works for you.</p><p>Trust your gut and gravitate toward experiences that seem most enjoyable when you imagine them, says Dr. Bufka. For one person, a long day on the beach reading is best, while another comes alive thinking about exploring local culture. Those who are uncomfortable in large crowds, for example, might want to avoid a jam-packed flea market, but might benefit from visiting a local coffee shop, says Dr. Bufka.</p><p>\"A lot of stress comes when we're not meeting our own or others' expectations,\" she says.</p><p>Set boundaries around work</p><p>A good vacation begins with a solid out-of-office plan. Let bosses, clients and employees know you are unavailable during time off—and who will cover for you.</p><p>If going completely off the grid is more stressful for you than doing contained, small amounts of work throughout the trip, then schedule a short chunk of time for those tasks each day. For instance, you may want to check email at certain preset times.</p><p>Craig Montz, a father of three and manager at a construction firm in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says he tried a new tactic on a family trip to Disney World last fall. He left his work phone at the hotel during the day but gave a few employees his personal cellphone number just in case.</p><p>\"The fact that they weren't calling my personal phone also helped reduce the stress, because, hey, it's not a big enough emergency if they didn't call me personally,\" says Mr. Montz.</p><p>Identify a timeout space</p><p>Stressful moments are bound to arise on vacation no matter your plans.</p><p>Many travelers have gotten rusty at navigating conflicts and problems that pop up on trips, whether it's a canceled flight or tension with family or friends, says clinical psychologist JoAnne Pedro-Carroll.</p><p>One stress-reducing tactic she advises: Go outside or sit near a window with a view of nature. Just 10 minutes of sitting or walking in nature can decrease a person's heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol levels, as well as self-reported stress levels, according to Don Rakow and Gen Meredith, co-lead authors of a 2020 study about the connection between mental health and nature. If you're in a busy area or can't get outside, find a private indoor space where you can zone out from the stress for a moment.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are your best tips for de-stressing on vacation? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Emma Ehrenzeller, a hypnotist and life coach in Raleigh, N.C., recently embarked on her first family trip since before the pandemic. Her group—six people, three dogs—packed into a three-bedroom house.</p><p>She took short trips to the bathroom to practice deep breathing when she felt overwhelmed and meditated each morning. There is often pressure for a vacation to feel like sunshine and rainbows, she says, but it can be stressful.</p><p>\"The first thing I do for myself is acknowledge that stress can come at this time, and that's OK.\"</p><p>Write to Alex Janin at alex.janin@wsj.com</p><p>Don't Try to Have a Perfect Vacation.
