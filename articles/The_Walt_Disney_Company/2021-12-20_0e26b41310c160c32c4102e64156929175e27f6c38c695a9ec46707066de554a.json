  "text": "<p>The biggest splash is “How I Met Your Father” (Jan. 18), the long-awaited, not-quite-sequel to the long-running sitcom “How I Met Your Mother.” Hilary Duff stars this time around as a single young woman in New York City, with an older version of herself (played by Kim Cattrall) narrating the story of how she met her true love — and all the romantic misadventures that preceded that. Two episodes will drop on its premiere date, with new eps every following week.</p><p>There's also the original movie “Sex Appeal” (Jan. 14), a teen coming-of-age sex comedy starring Mika Abdalla, and featuring Margaret Cho and Fortune Feimster.</p><p>Also: What's coming in January to Netflix | Amazon Prime Video</p><p>But while light on originals, the Disney DIS-owned streaming service has a loaded roster of network shows streaming a day after they air, including ABC's new civil-rights drama series “Women of the Movement” (Jan. 7); a new season of “The Bachelor” (Jan. 4); the new grade-school sitcom “Abbott Elementary” (Jan. 4); and season premieres of NBC's “This Is Us” (Jan. 5) and ABC's “Black-ish” (Jan. 6).</p><p>Hulu will also bolster its movie offerings, with “Devil in a Blue Dress,” “Last of the Mohicans,” “Midnight in Paris,” “Three Days of the Condor” and six “Star Trek” movies.</p><p>Here's the full list of what's coming and going, as of Dec. 19 (release dates are subject to change):</p><p>What's coming in January 2022</p><p>Jan. 1Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve Anniversary SpecialDick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan SeacrestFox's New Year's Eve Live 2022, Part 1Fox's New Year's Eve Live 2022, Part 2Black Ink Crew: Complete Season 4The Challenge: Complete Season 33Dark Side of the 90s: Complete Season 1RuPaul's Drag Race: Complete Season 8Vice Versa: Chyna: Complete Season 1Vice Versa: College $ports Inc.: Complete Season 110,000 BC (2008)(500) Days Of Summer (2009)A Night at the Roxbury (1998)A Soldier's Story (1984)Alfie (2004)All the Right Moves (1983)Amistad (1997)An Officer and a Gentleman (1982)Astro Boy (2009)Beautiful Creatures (2013)Beerfest (2006)Big Top Pee-Wee (1988)Black Rain (1989)Black Sunday (1977)Case 39 (2010)Charlie's Angels (2000)The Collection (2012)Commando (1985)Coneheads (1993)Courage Under Fire (1996)Coyote Ugly (2000)Crime Story (2021)Date Night (2010)Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2010)Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003)Dolphin Tale 2 (2014)The Duchess (2008)Dunston Checks In (1996)Escape from Alcatraz (1979)Falling for Figaro (2021)Fire in the Sky (1993)The Foot Fist Way (2006)Forces of Nature (1999)Fred Claus (2007)Furry Vengeance (2010)G.I.
