  "text": "<p>Xiaomi made headlines this month with the news it overtook Apple in the second quarter to become the<a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021\"> world's second-largest smartphone vendor</a> for the first time, but did you know the Chinese company is number one when it comes to e-scooters or was the first company to develop a smart rice cooker?</p> <p>I visited its one and only UK store last week, which had a grand reopening on Saturday after being shut down for more than a year. I was to be shown “new product”, but rather than smartphones, the line-up comprised an e-scooter (see Tech Tools below), Wi-Fi router, gaming monitor and earbuds. The store's shelves were full of security cameras, smart lighting, watches, fitness bands, and a transparent TV was on display.</p> <p>All this suggests Xiaomi has aspirations as a general consumer electronics brand, yet its focus is still on challenging Samsung in handsets and the common factor in its products ecosystem is that they can all be controlled by a smartphone app.</p> <p>The company has made remarkable progress, having only been founded in 2010. It started with just operating system software that was free, before beginning direct online sales of a phone. It now has 1,000 physical Mi stores globally, including 100 in Western Europe, and a target of 10,000 stores opening in China alone by the end of the year. </p> <p>Smartphone sales rose 83 per cent in the second quarter and the next objective is to compete in the premium category with Apple and Samsung. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5116466-b525-4400-98c7-be2fc0e64f41\">Xiaomi has profited </a>from Huawei sanctions but it has other Chinese rivals. “It will be a tough battle, with Oppo and Vivo sharing the same objective,” say analysts at the Canalys research firm.&#xa0;“And both willing to spend big on above-the-line marketing to build their brands in a way that Xiaomi is not.” </p> <p>The battle is being extended geographically with Xiaomi looking to open more stores and grow share in markets like the UK. It also has a number of sub-brands such as Redmi and sees itself <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/04/how-xiaomi-became-an-internet-of-things-powerhouse\">building an advantage in “AI IoT” </a>— intelligent Internet of Things smart home products. This is boosting sales and the brand as customers buy add-ons as products increasingly talk to one another or understand what you are saying to them. Its new air fryer will cook chips if you tell it to, just as well as its Wi-Fi rice cooker softened grains when<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CJB-28971\"> it was introduced</a> back in 2016.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Bezos offers Nasa a discount</strong><br>Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51f95019-407d-4c55-a6de-0a0586ca85d5\">offered to cover $2bn </a>in costs in exchange for being awarded a Nasa contract to help land astronauts on the moon. In April, Nasa&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/291693b1-52a3-4867-97f4-8047d5c39a4e\">selected Elon Musk's SpaceX</a>&#xa0;for the programme, citing budgetary constraints.</p> <p><strong>2. SoftBank's Didi bet is $4bn in red&#xa0;<br></strong>The Vision Fund's 20.1 per cent stake in the taxi app Didi Chuxing, for which it paid $11.8bn in 2019, is&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66afff06-cee0-4e83-ba86-be674baee2c7\">now worth $7.8bn</a>&#xa0;after Chinese regulatory pressure hit Didi's business prospects, cutting its market value almost in half.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>3. Oh Man: Crypto ‘has no inherent worth'</strong><br>The chief executive of Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9275baf4-0422-43a1-b8c9-9317882ca874\">cryptocurrencies have “no inherent worth” </a>but are creating trading opportunities for his company because of their wild price swings. Luke Ellis was talking to the FT's Gary Silverman, who comments that US regulators are&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e196014a-c5bc-4b2e-8455-5b5b8d878209\">failing to reel in cryptocurrency</a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>4. IPO plans for water buffalo delivery company</strong><br>Ninja Van, a logistics group that has used motorcycles, boats and even water buffaloes to deliver 1.7m parcels every day across south-east Asia, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0370ed26-4427-428d-bf1c-ece33c59630f\">considering an initial public offering </a>as early as next year after being valued at $1bn.</p> <p><strong>5. Why Netflix is moving into gaming</strong><br>The online media company is not taking advantage of its streaming technology to go into competition with Google's Stadia or Microsoft's xCloud,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d84dfa0-c88a-4380-85a0-9e9db46124f5\"> explains Tim Bradshaw</a>. Netflix's strategy more closely resembles earlier efforts by Hollywood studios such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros to develop games based on franchises such as Batman, Lord of the Rings and Spider-Man.</p> <h2>Tech week ahead</h2> <p><em><strong>Monday:</strong></em> After the closing bell, <strong>Tesla</strong> is expected to report a record quarterly profit. </p> <p><em><strong>Tuesday:</strong></em> A big day for Big Tech earnings. <strong>Apple</strong>&#xa0;is expected to post a 26 per cent rise in third-quarter revenue as demand remained strong for its 5G iPhones. However, the company has warned the global chip shortage will dent iPad and Mac sales in the quarter. Google parent<strong>&#xa0;Alphabet </strong>is also expected to post a rise in second-quarter revenue as it continues to benefit from a recovery in ad spend, that was earlier battered by the pandemic.&#xa0;<strong>Microsoft</strong> reports its fourth-quarter earnings and chipmaker <strong>AMD</strong> also has results. The Senate Judiciary committee will<a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/america-under-cyber-siege-preventing-and-responding-to-ransomware-attacks\"> hold a hearing</a> on <strong>ransomware attacks</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Wednesday:</strong></em> After the market close, <strong>Facebook</strong>&#xa0;is expected to report a surge in second-quarter revenues, powered by demand for ads on its social media platforms as the pandemic drove consumers to shop, and spend more time online. <strong>Qualcomm, PayPal</strong> and <strong>Spotify</strong> also report.</p> <p><em><strong>Thursday:</strong></em> Ecommerce giant <strong>Amazon </strong>is expected to see a jump in second-quarter revenue boosted by demand for cloud services and its annual Prime Day sales event in June. Trading app <strong>Robinhood</strong> goes public. UK telecoms group <strong>BT</strong> has interim results. <strong>Samsung </strong>is due to give details on how it managed to post a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://url4336.noreturn.nikkei.info/ls/click?upn=Zg38KYKGFx2oOxNFPUW6Vh4RNl33JgW3NheG4JLnkiRoELC8v-2BerXSGVLHmyULsa6ijNmxpEN8bybfQlkvBnYeJCFYqbmpM8e3GrlAwGoj9E1OwmtJ56C2wkGvF11Adto1CwiZRz2Bgc23MJX86ruj5fuLEOQHQjsf4PK6LS0h9A3qGHa27ib4EZjWuSf1ITdr-2BCVpeG-2BV-2B5EpdBy-2BiRH8-2FfPEoTh0tXTrqZlt9ux0lvlfGhf-2BKYKGS-2BmU7GjUflpFkotDLEmJSAQjEEhmvBZoqk0lqaaNa3vjoU-2BXK9Hms-3DIzah_YMJdYxCsbA3IVx986czIdQON5rTWAaKRBkrddEXzIDxNUJixbJSVf6xYp-2BSMDy6Vypuc-2B87KZVaHDNayPKltSUBbU7eCVB-2BEjDWHg-2BUiC3vVsCXS-2BKe5jTW-2FbhVYITWNON4vfo2WzVCLquViWzY7FSZEQp8YR4Pj2bywo-2FMCgRe0s6F-2FgAt-2FHddy9TvHrELCb6nvK-2FVj1FToH1slZ2Oj17TSndN5KjroxyI5MIlUMK1CyZeCiMRdPySYElo5brAlStCQF04PepPCUliJtgGGZ9H50XbEqYYpx0Tq3NflYAC5OkTGjbwmH8skUNY7XpcLxqOnDZ-2B84s-2BPBiRScBtQ69Pwg6udAaG7V6MPTTYiWwa-2FYfs3CdXY2JytF6rtO-2FUOmoyjb-2BOIFBAK5dTHMVv-2Bp6Q-2FZdY4u8C08-2FktXOXwy7SzEXnquOUOv4awuYQYG7yMDFTQQsXHDzbotRKDJJZfjrt4Y1QhsJtPYryLYx0BUo7mcHF4pfxZ64CEerHJimoUvTXWCdIDI55x28OHdyz5w649SwGASpJbOMuNBZ-2FYbFQ-3D\">53 per cent jump in operating profit</a>&#xa0;in the second quarter from a year before. Analysts see strong demand for memory chips as the likely explanation, with gains there offsetting declining sales and production delays in India and Vietnam for its smartphone business. <strong>Huawei </strong>launches the long-awaited next generation of its flagship P series smartphone</p> <p><em><strong>Friday:</strong></em> In the UK, industrial software company <strong>Aveva</strong> has a trading update.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Mi Electric Scooter 3</h2> <p>Personal e-scooters are still illegal on the UK's roads, so this may limit the appeal of market leader <a href=\"https://www.mi.com/global/mi-electric-scooter-3/overview/\">Xiaomi's latest model. The 3 </a>has a battery range of up to 30km, a maximum speed of 25km/h, an ”aerospace grade” aluminium body, pneumatic tires and a new rear dual-pad disc brake. I was impressed by the mechanism that snaps back the handlebars and clips them to the rear wheel for easy carrying. It weighs 13kg, the battery charges in just over 8 hours and there is a headlight and LCD display. Availability in the UK will be some time this quarter and the price has yet to be announced. </p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Xiaomi shouts out smartphones and more in show-me stores' FT.com 26 July.
