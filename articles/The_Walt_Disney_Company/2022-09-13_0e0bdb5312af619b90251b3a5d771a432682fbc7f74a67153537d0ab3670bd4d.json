  "title": "Trendy Parents Blaze Wagon Trail",
  "text": "<p>\"It's very much an off-the-mountain kind of thing,\" said Ms. Marrs, who runs the lifestyle blog Magnolia Stripes. \"It's very rugged-looking.\"</p><p>On TikTok, parents have taken to posting tips for accessorizing wagons with cupholders, snack trays, all-terrain wheels and canopies. In addition to the Veer, which starts at $699, there are models from WonderFold ($899 for the W4 Luxe Stroller Wagon), Evenflo ($400), Keenz ($850 for the luxury comfort stroller wagon that holds four passengers) and the more-affordable MacSports (roughly $100-$160, but seatless), among others.</p><p>With the canopy up and snack tray in, parents can look like they are pushing a hot-dog cart full of children. And like status strollers before them, status wagons crib the language of automotive sales to shill luxury features: The $750 Keenz two-passenger model, geared at ages 6 months and up, comes \"fully loaded\" with all-terrain wheels, spring suspension and cushioned reclining seats.</p><p>Online registry Babylist said the number of people adding stroller wagons to their baby registries increased about 40% from 2020 to 2021, and grew 55% from 2021 to 2022. According to the market research firm Fact.MR, stroller-wagon sales in the U.S. are poised to reach $1.5 billion by the end of 2022.</p><p>But where there is pull, there is also pushback. In 2019, Disney updated its park rules to ban stroller wagons, as well as oversize strollers (larger than 31\" x 52\"), to \"provide a more enjoyable experience for our guests by easing guest flow and reducing congestion,\" a spokesperson said.</p><p>Online, fans of the park cracked jokes about parents making the \"walk of shame\" back to their hotels with their oversize carriages. Wagon stalwarts petitioned Disney to reverse the ban; their efforts have so far been futile.</p><p>Elsewhere, parents like Lauren Wellbank, a writer and mother in Allentown, Pa., continue to pack their kids into the wagons. \"If one of them gets in, all three have to get in,\" Ms. Wellbank said of her MacSports folding utility wagon.</p>",
