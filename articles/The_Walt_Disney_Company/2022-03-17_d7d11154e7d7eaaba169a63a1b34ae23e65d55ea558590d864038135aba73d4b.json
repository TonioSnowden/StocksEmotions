  "text": "<p>A spoiler warning should probably be thrown over the whole of none-more-black comedy <em>Fresh</em>, a feminist midnight movie with a shock up the sleeve. “Things don't turn out the way we thought,” goes one telling line. So it proves in a film whose splashy audacity extends to the titles, arriving after 33 minutes, an upper-case Before and After. Until then, we learn, director Mimi Cave has been lulling us, passing her film off as wry reportage on modern dating, the heroine Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) exhausted by swiping and sketchy dudes. Salvation seems to enter with Steve (Sebastian Stan), slick but not oppressively so, met-cute in the supermarket. Romantics, quit now.</p> <p>Steve's career in plastic surgery might raise a red flag. It says a lot about Cave's canny (mis)direction and life today that alarm bells ring louder at his lack of social media. Either way, Noa is eventually plunged through the looking glass, lost in the horror of the story's next two acts. To say more would only blow the surprise. (Really, feel free to come back after watching.) For everyone still reading, let's say only that Noa becomes party to Steve's niche taste in gastronomy, which has also inspired a thriving small business.</p> <p>Part of the warped charm of the movie is Cave's matchmaking. Even after the nightmare reveal, her leads have chemistry. While Steve can feel like an <em>American Psycho</em> tribute act, Stan plays him like an original. And Edgar-Jones's Noa is a terrific, self-taught iron fist: Steve deserves her. The humour can be stomach-turning. (You may never eat pâté again.) Then again, the subtexts of gender and luxury economics — lightly worn — are often grisly too. </p> <p>But the whirr of subplots also resembles an over-extended tasting menu. Too many dishes fly by; the evening starts to feel like a long night. For all the brazen satire, meanwhile, no gag is juicier than the fact that, in 2022, <em>Fresh</em> is a Disney movie. &#xa0;</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On Disney Plus in the UK from March 18 and Hulu in the US now</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2022 'Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan pair up for black comedy Fresh' FT.com 17 March.
