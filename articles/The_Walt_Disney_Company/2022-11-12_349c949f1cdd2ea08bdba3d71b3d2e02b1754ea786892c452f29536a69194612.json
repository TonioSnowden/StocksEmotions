  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Elon Musk could succeed in making Twitter both bigger and smaller. His new rivals certainly wouldn't mind the latter. </p><p>\n  The voluble billionaire's first two weeks running the social platform he spent $44 billion to buy have been predictably messy. Half the workforce has been canned, several top-level executives have either quit or been fired, new subscription plans and verification changes have seen hasty and problem-riddled rollouts, and policies around key topics like content moderation have seemingly been made by tweet and discarded the same way. </p><p>\n  The result has been a drama that may be drawing eyeballs, but is predictably frightening to those Mr. Musk needs most -- advertisers. Mr. Musk tweeted on Friday morning that Twitter \"hit all-time high of active users today.\" Given Twitter no longer publicly reports such data, the world will just have to take his word for that. </p><p>\n  The Wall Street Journal reported late last week that large brand owners such as General Mills, Mondelez International, Pfizer and Volkswagen have \"temporarily paused\" spending on Twitter on worries about the changes Mr. Musk is making. </p><p>\n  Mr. Musk tweeted late last week that Twitter has seen \"a massive drop in revenue,\" and in an all-hands meeting with employees on Thursday, he continued to paint the situation as dire -- noting the company is burning cash at an unsustainable rate and that bankruptcy is \"not out of the question,\" according to multiple accounts of the meeting. </p><p>\n  Twitter is now a private company, with its last reported financial figures reflecting business only to the end of June -- four months before Mr. Musk formally took control. And Mr. Musk's proclamations could have a self-serving aspect, enabling him to justify radical moves he's long wanted to see on his favorite platform while also slashing the costs of a business he substantially overpaid for. But some trends have been apparent for a while, suggesting some of his claims might well have merit. </p><p>\n  The entire online advertising market has been weakening all year -- with declines picking up speed in the third quarter. Facebook parent Meta Platforms saw ad revenue fall 5% year-over-year in that period, and the company just slashed 11,000 workers from its own rolls, suggesting a turnaround isn't imminent. </p><p>\n  Twitter generated $4.7 billion in advertising revenue for the trailing 12-month period ended in June. Mr. Musk's volatile management of the platform means he may have just thrown that up for grabs for his newest competitors -- at a time when each of them could really use it. </p><p>\n  Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI said Facebook and Google's parent companies would be likely beneficiaries, the latter especially with its YouTube segment. He also noted that both Netflix and Walt Disney could pick up some of that spend, as both are launching ad-supported tiers of their streaming services. </p><p>\n  In this economy, there is also the distinct possibility that advertisers will simply pocket what they were spending on Twitter instead of reallocating it. This is a reminder that Twitter has long had a problem in this regard -- it is simply not big enough. Twitter's last publicly reported daily user count was more than 100 million less than Snapchat's and about 12% the size of Facebook's. </p><p>\n  Either way, the biggest risk to Twitter now is that the advertisers who have pulled back discover they aren't missing much. It is a lousy time for a subscale platform to learn it is, itself, nonessential spend. </p><p></p>",
