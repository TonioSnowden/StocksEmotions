  "title": "Disney CEO Says Strategy Is  All About Making It Personal  ----  By Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>   The Walt Disney Co. is focused on telling stories in \"a more customized, more personalized way\" and \"bringing together the physicality plus the media element of Disney,\" chief executive Bob Chapek said Wednesday. </p><p>   Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference, Mr. Chapek said the entertainment company is working on ways to unite its two main business lines -- its parks, experiences and products division and its media, content and streaming division -- using the Disney+ app. The idea, he said, is to steer content to customers based on what theme park rides a visitor prefers, for example, rather than trying to predict what a customer will like based on past viewing or personal information. </p><p>   Recommendations based on customers' demographic characteristics often \"are a complete record scratch because it is nothing like what you watch,\" Mr. Chapek said. Once the company unites data collection capabilities between its various divisions, \"we can give you a better experience in the park, because we know what your preferences are in terms of viewing and a better experience on Disney+ because we know what your affinities are,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek said he believes that in the future there will be fewer streaming services than there are today, but spoke as well about the challenge of setting the right pace for adding new content to Disney's streaming platforms, which include not only Disney+ but also Hulu and ESPN+. He said the right cadence of offerings satisfies viewers but doesn't overwhelm them. </p><p>   The Covid-19 pandemic delayed many productions and led to a buildup of content in Disney's pipeline, Mr. Chapek said, but \"finally the dam broke and now all that content is rushing out.\" This gives the company the opportunity to more thoughtfully plan out how to distribute movies and TV series across its various platforms without worrying about not having enough to show, he said. </p><p>   Over the last three years, Disney has moved to expand its menu of general entertainment offerings, including more adult-oriented shows such as \"The Kardashians\" on Hulu, which Mr. Chapek said help provide options for fans of all ages. </p><p>   He said that after more than 30 years at the company, he is still surprised by how much \"elasticity\" the Disney brand has, and said concerns about what's appropriate to show on a Disney-owned streaming service are overstated. </p><p>   \"I want to respect what this brand is. But at the same time, I know that we may be even more precious about what is 'Disney' than the consumer base is,\" Mr. Chapek said. \"If the consumer base has more elasticity, we probably ought to listen to our audience, which means we have more degrees of freedom than we probably thought.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chapek highlighted Disney's investments in what he called \"centers of creative excellence\" around the globe that develop local-language content in countries such as India. </p><p>   ESPN continues to be a crucial part of Disney's business, Mr. Chapek said. Whether the ESPN brand incorporates sports betting in the future will be up to the consumer, according to Mr. Chapek. </p><p>   Disney's parks division has recently made a fresh round of price increases, which, on top of changes at the theme parks since the pandemic meant to generate more income from fewer visitors, have led to tension with longtime Disney fans. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek said the changes, including higher prices, pricey add-ons to the parks app and an online reservation system that limits crowd size at the parks, are necessary to guarantee a good experience in a world where the company can't control demand and doesn't want to turn away visitors. </p><p>   \"We can have pricing be a reflection of how many people we can actually let in,\" he said. \"For some of our fans, that is heresy. But it's not only good business practice in terms of maximizing shareholder value, but it protects the guest experience.\" </p><p></p>",
