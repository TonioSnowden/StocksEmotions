  "title": "With Biden Mandate Blocked, Many Companies Won't Impose Covid-19 Vaccine Rules; Some corporate leaders applauded the Supreme Court's rejection of the mandate",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Williams said he worried his organization could lose some employees if they didn't want to comply. He also said he didn't understand why the mandate applied only to companies with more than 100 employees.</p><p>\"We're still going to say get it,\" he said of the vaccine, \"but it's not going to be mandatory.\"</p><p>Many prominent U.S. companies have some sort of vaccine requirements but have stopped short of mandating them for all staff. U.S. airlines and a few high-profile companies, including Walt Disney Co. and Tyson Foods Inc., have adopted vaccine mandates for their workers. Others such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. required them for employees returning to their offices.</p><p>But many other corporate leaders held off in implementing vaccine or testing policies, waiting to see if the Biden administration's rules would withstand legal challenges. In a November survey commissioned by a human-resources trade group, 75% of employers surveyed said they would likely not put vaccine or testing rules in place if the administration's mandates were permanently struck down. The group, the Society for Human Resource Management, said 1,000 of its members responded to the survey.</p><p>The original mandate divided corporate leaders. Some executives said they welcomed the directive because it gave them some cover to put vaccination requirements in place even if some employees objected. The federal order required employers to ensure their workers were vaccinated or tested weekly for Covid-19.</p><p>Deloitte U.S. has required vaccinations for U.S. employees to access the professional services firm's offices and its Deloitte University training campus. CEO Joe Ucuzoglu said that he didn't expect the Supreme Court's decision to change the company's policies.</p><p>\"We've set a policy that makes sense for our organization and that has served us incredibly well, and we have no intention of altering it,\" he said.</p><p>United Airlines Holdings Inc., the first major airline to implement a vaccine requirement, said that no vaccinated staffer has died from the disease over the past eight weeks. The airline said it was reporting about one death a week before the mandate's implementation.</p><p>\"I know that some people still disagree with our policy,\" Chief Executive Scott Kirby wrote in a letter to employees Tuesday. \"United is proving that requiring the vaccine is the right thing to do because it saves lives.\"</p><p>A number of companies put their plans to mandate vaccines on pause after the Biden administration's requirements for private employers, federal contractors and healthcare workers were challenged. General Electric Co. and Union Pacific Corp. were among those that suspended vaccine requirements for workers.</p><p>Others, including Southwest Airlines Co. and Raytheon Technologies Corp., said at the time that they would keep plans to mandate vaccines in place. New York City implemented a mandate for private employers that went into effect in late December. Earlier this month, Starbucks Corp. said it would mandate vaccines or testing for its U.S. employees next month to comply with the federal rules.</p><p>The National Retail Federation, which had argued against the legality of the mandate, called Thursday's decision a \"significant victory for employers,\" while noting that it still supports vaccines in helping to overcome the pandemic. The Business Roundtable, another trade group, said it respected the court's decision and added that while companies may take different approaches, \"efforts to promote vaccination will not abate.\"</p><p>U.S. trucking executives and industry groups that had previously warned the vaccine mandate could deepen upheaval in domestic supply chains welcomed the ruling.</p><p>\"It's a relief,\" said Eric Fuller, chief executive of U.S. Xpress Enterprises Inc., a large trucking carrier based in Chattanooga, Tenn. \"As much as I wish everyone would get vaccinated, this mandate was going to create a lot of headaches for a lot of companies.\"</p><p>The ruling came a day after OSHA issued new guidance on the mandate's application to truck drivers, saying that it didn't apply to drivers who are the sole occupants of their vehicles or to individuals who spend only brief periods indoors with others.</p><p>Some executives said the Supreme Court's decision removed at least some uncertainty that had hung over their operations in recent months, even as they planned to continue to advocate for their employees to get vaccinated. The high court let stand a vaccine mandate for workers at healthcare companies that accept Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>The American Medical Association, in a statement, said it was pleased that the court allowed the Biden administration to mandate vaccines for healthcare workers, but expressed disappointment that it had struck down the requirements for private employers.</p><p>The \"Supreme Court today halted one of the most effective tools in the fight against further transmission and death from this aggressive virus,\" said Dr. Gerald E. Harmon, president of the American Medical Association. \"Workplace transmission has been a major factor in the spread of Covid-19.\"</p><p>At Jetco Delivery, a Houston trucking and logistics company, executives sent an email to employees within minutes of the Supreme Court's decision, letting them know that employees could disregard previous instructions on how to comply with the vaccine or testing requirements.</p><p>\"We kind of breathed a sigh of relief, and we told our team not to worry about it,\" said Brian Fielkow, chief executive of Jetco.</p><p>Mr. Fielkow said he is personally passionate about the Covid-19 vaccines, and urges employees to get them, but that he also believes the federal government had put companies in a difficult position.</p><p>\"It really comes down to, 'At what point does my role as an employer end?'\" Mr. Fielkow said. \"I really do agree with the court's rationale that this was an overreach.\"</p><p>He also worried that it would have been operationally difficult to put the rules into place, particularly for unvaccinated workers in need of regular tests.</p><p>\"The weekly testing really would have been a burden,\" he said, especially given recent challenges in accessing tests nationwide. \"We don't have to be concerned about that; we can focus on running our business.\"</p><p>Jennifer Smith contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Chip Cutter at chip.cutter@wsj.com</p><p>With Biden Mandate Blocked, Many Companies Won't Impose Covid-19 Vaccine Rules</p>",
