  "text": "<p>Netflix, the maker of the Attenborough climate documentary, plans to banish dirty diesel generators from film sets and use more virtual production techniques, after a review found that more than half of the company's carbon emissions came from film production.</p> <p>Although the US group serves more than 200m online video subscribers worldwide, the study of its emissions showed they came mainly from intensive productions rather than from the data centres behind its streaming service.</p> <p>Netflix will also adopt a carbon price in its budgeting process as a key internal change, as it sets a target for net zero emissions by 2022. </p> <p>Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told the Financial Times that the group was taking responsibility for the carbon footprint of all its branded shows, not just those it makes itself.</p> <p>“The majority of our footprint is producing shows like <em>The Crown</em>,” he said. “Our imprint is actually creating our content, building sets, moving people around to be able to produce a series or film. The thing that you think of — like the office or [Amazon Web Services] — is pretty darn small.” </p> <p>The US company aims to cut its direct emissions, from fuel and electricity, by 45 per cent by 2030 against its level in 2019. </p> <p>To reach its net zero goal by 2022, it will compensate for existing emissions by purchasing offsets and funding conservation projects such as grassland restoration.</p> <p>Cleaner approaches to film production will include the use of electric batteries and transport, hiring local crews, reducing air travel and introducing more LED lights. Virtual production techniques, such as those used in Disney's <em>The</em> <em>Mandalorian</em> series, also cut emissions by filming actors in front of LED screens showing the digital landscape. </p> <p>Emma Stewart, Netflix's sustainability officer, said: “We are essentially assembling a small city [each time we build a set] and then dismantling it, it comes with a lot of energy.” </p> <p>Hastings said Netflix would develop a system similar to an “internal carbon tax” in accounting, which would give those with budget responsibility in the company an incentive to cut emissions so they were not charged for carbon use. </p> <p>While big tech groups such as Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft have in recent years set some of the world's most ambitious climate targets, the entertainment industry has been slower to transform.</p> <p>Hastings said “the fair comparison” for Netflix was the film and television sector, where he hoped groups such as Walt Disney, ViacomCBS and the BBC “would follow our lead about green productions”. </p> <p>“In tech it has been popular, but in entertainment, we're the first as far as we know to go down that path,” he said. Walt Disney and the BBC have set net zero targets for 2030 and are among many big entertainment groups trying to introduce a cleaner and more sustainable approach to production.</p> <p>Netflix said the company emitted 1.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, including direct and indirect emissions — about as much as 125,000 US households emit in a year.</p> <p>However, it excluded from the calculations the emissions from the transmission of its shows to customer devices as well as the electricity used by a particular television or computer.</p> <p>A 2020 report commissioned by the British Film Institute estimated that an average “tent-pole” movie production would generate 2,840 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to driving a car more than 11m kilometres.</p> <p>Almost half the emissions in making a film were accounted for by transport, a third from electricity and gas use and a sixth by diesel generators. The consumption needs of a set included the use of enough plywood to fill two and a half cargo planes. </p> <p>Hastings said: “Left Bank makes <em>The Crown</em> for us. So nominally we could lay that off on Left Bank's ledgers. But we say if it is branded — that is what the consumer expects.”</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ftclimate/\"><em>@ftclimate</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Alex Barker and Leslie Hook in London 2021 'Netflix plans to clean up film sets to cut carbon footprint' FT.com 30 March.
