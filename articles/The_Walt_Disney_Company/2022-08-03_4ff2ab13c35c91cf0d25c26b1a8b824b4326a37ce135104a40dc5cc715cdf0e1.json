  "text": "<p>A parallel reality where idols became flesh popped up in south London's Southwark Park last weekend. Billed as “the biggest Europe outdoor K-pop festival ever”, Made in Korea brought out heavyweights of a genre defined more by global earning power than national identity. Entertainment businesses listed in Seoul raised a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/606ae403-2425-4329-bd8a-e8eb6f20237c\">record $3.8bn last year</a> as acts — or rather corporate management — criss-crossed borders to cash in on obsessive fandom.</p> <p>With its ruthlessly curated selection of functional bangers, from teenybopper kitsch to “poppin' soju bottles” in the strip club, Made in Korea opened a portal to a globalised utopia: a post-racial Y2K fever dream where cash can suspend reality. For the thousands who shelled out up to £168 to stand in a parched field with shambolic catering and a site-wide alcohol ban, the otherworldly talent onstage was worth every penny.</p> <p>Notions of a “K-pop” Saturday and “hip-hop” Sunday proved as broad as the festival's title: it turned out that acts had been categorised not by genre but by their target consumers. Saturday felt like seven hours of Disney Channel programming; Sunday's headliner was kicked out of a boy band after writing <a href=\"https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1006489678\">“Korea is gay”</a> on MySpace in 2005. </p> <p>K-pop's cutesy, innocent image — and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7d4dcac-9354-4fb0-9d97-8bce29371e9c\">undercurrent of exploitation</a> — echo the American model that gave rise to Britney Spears and NSYNC in the 1990s. Made in Korea's family-friendly Saturday offered relentless positivity and unattainable perfection: a top-notch primary-school disco soundtrack with Korean lyrics and fiendishly difficult dance routines.</p> <p>Ten-man group Golden Child appeared in uniform, epaulettes bouncing fetchingly to the tropical house beat of “Burn It”; girl group Cherry Bullet cavorted to the syrupy synth-pop of “Love in Space” with hair and make-up impervious to the oppressive heat. A clear hint of the forces marshalling these tween hormones came when Suho, formerly of megaband EXO, introduced the Coldplay-esque ballad “Grey Suit” as “a metaphor for my military service”.</p> <p>Tightly scripted fan service began to jar around the third hour: acts hailed their “first time” in London as “very lovely”, made ultra-PG double entendres and extracted a vow of brand loyalty from the hysterical crowd. The ingénue mask slipped a little with Chungha, a ferociously charismatic solo act with the vocal chops and anime-inflected fashion sense of <a href=\"https://www.capitalxtra.com/artists/ariana-grande/news/accused-asian-fishing-new-photoshoot/\">Ariana Grande</a>; the twinge of sarcasm in her Dallas accent was welcome after her battle with the faulty sound system. But the post-American dream returned in force with headliners Red Velvet going for the Noughties jugular in denim and rhinestones to the delight of a crowd ranging from children to a thirtysomething woman who had travelled solo from Iowa.</p> <p>By Sunday the last clusters of ponytailed white men in the audience had dispersed; in their place came rave shades, Prada bum bags and bucket-hatted lads staggering towards the welfare tent. Made in Korea's programming replicated both the mainstream and the subculture of westernised Korean music, and “hip-hop” turned out to denote performers targeting actual diaspora Asian people. Opener Jessi set the tone, living up to a memorable if baffling sign at the front of the audience hailing her as the “sexist mommy” of “NY boss rap”. Sporting fuzzy cowboy hat, hoops and K-hip-hop's ubiquitous “blaccent”, the New Jersey native electrified the crowd with swaggering bilingual bangers. </p> <p>Elder statesmen Epik High took the crowd back to their 2003 debut with riotous oldskool emceeing, but a young, diverse crowd, in which hijabs mingled with Balenciaga and bondage gear, was stoked to a frenzy by the last three acts. Gray and Loco revelled in their virtuosic flows and rap-god swagger; their breakbeats, beanies and hometown shoutouts felt like authentic nods to hip-hop culture, with Gray joking to the crowd that “man's not hot”.</p> <p>Picking bras off the stage as they worked through lascivious RnB tracks — aided by female soloist Lee Hi, bringing more than a hint of Aaliyah — the two had worked the audience into a sweaty, shrieking mess by the time Jay Park and his dancers finally appeared. Decisively purging Saturday's atmosphere of well-behaved repression, K-hip-hop progenitor and professional bad boy Park closed the festival with bass-shaking, trap-tinged twerk anthems. “Pulling up in K-town, yeah I'm feeling like the President/ You an outsider, why you acting like a resident” he snarled, whipping off his shirt to reveal an expanse of carefully waxed and tattooed muscle.</p> <p>It seemed that Made in Korea really had brought “K-music” to London: the thrill of fandom and fantasy, with a reminder of the underlying financial interests. Fans who had camped out since noon faced long queues for a £5 cup of water or bowl of instant ramen. Having screamed themselves hoarse in the raucous, drill-laced finale, the crowd drifted off to the broken portable loos without complaint.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mikfestival.com/\"><em>mikfestival.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Áine Kim Kennedy 2022 'Made in Korea music festival sets the tills ringing with K-pop extravaganza' FT.com 3 August.
