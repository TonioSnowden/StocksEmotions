  "title": "Trumpism According to Trump",
  "text": "<p>It occurred during what I thought were the most intriguing passages in the speech, when the former president offered his definition of \"Trumpism.\"</p><p>\"Many people have asked what is Trumpism,\" Mr. Trump said, noting in a spurt of modesty that it is a term \"I didn't come up with.\"</p><p>It's true that \"Trumpism\" has largely been a made-up notion, expandable into whatever one's politics require.</p><p>Space limitations prevent a full description of what Democrats and the media think Trumpism is. Basically, it's the evil empire, a mortal threat to democracy, truth and justice.</p><p>On the right, Trumpism is usually seen as some version of a populism associated with myriad grievances -- the establishment, the swamp, immigration, globalism -- basically opposition to another evil empire. Let us not ignore that both left and right use Trumpism as imagined by their followers to extract millions in online donations.</p><p>But American politics isn't \"Star Wars\" yet. Eventually any serious politics must translate into discrete public policies, which is why it was useful to hear Mr. Trump explicitly associate Trumpism at CPAC with a set of identifiable ideas. In his words, this is what Donald Trump says Trumpism means:</p><p>\"What it means is great trade deals.\"</p><p>\"It means low taxes and eliminating job killing regulations, Trumpism.\"</p><p>\"It means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit.\"</p><p>\"It means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement.\"</p><p>\"It means very strong protection for the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms.\"</p><p>\"It means support for the forgotten men and women who have been taken advantage of for so many years.\"</p><p>\"It means a strong military and taking care of our vets.\"</p><p>\"We believe in patriotic education and strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America's youth.\"</p><p>\"We affirm that the Constitution means exactly what it says, as written.\"</p><p>\"We believe in standing up to China, shutting down outsourcing, bringing back our factories and supply chains, and ensuring that America not China dominates the future of the world.\"</p><p>These, he said, \"are the convictions that define our movement today and must define the Republican Party in the years ahead.\"</p><p>There were other elements, such as breaking up Big Tech and election reforms, but this was the core of it. Taken at face value, the items on this list should be the building blocks of a debate about the future of the Republican Party and its candidates. Most of it -- low taxes, regulatory relief, a robust military, constitutional originalism, the Second Amendment -- is identifiable with Ronald Reagan.</p><p>Reagan was more open to the world than Mr. Trump, and tariffs, borders and neo-autarky are issues that deserve debate. Phil Gramm and Pat Toomey made a cogent argument in these pages Wednesday that Mr. Trump's tariffs in fact retarded growth.</p><p>Mr. Trump was right to say Trumpism \"is simple.\" But something else isn't so simple, and likely never will be. There's the little matter of the GOP Sun King.</p><p>Mr. Trump's first term ended in chaos -- the election challenges, an invasion of the Capitol, a second impeachment and Republicans carving each other up over intraparty recriminations. All of which raises a pertinent question: Is Trumpism separable from Donald Trump? Or does Mr. Trump believe, like Louis XIV, \"Trumpism -- c'est moi\"?</p><p>In one of his off-script ruminations, Mr. Trump said something resembling self-awareness. He suggested that whatever policy he favored -- specifically building the border wall -- his opposition would reflexively oppose it. I think this can be regarded as a general theory of Trump politics. And unfortunately for his 2020 election result, too many voters who liked 75% of Trumpism concluded that their political beliefs could be separated, for one election, from Mr. Trump himself.</p><p>A possibility to consider is that Mr. Trump's insistence that he is the personification of Trumpism may be an impediment to achieving Trumpism's goals. Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Tom Cotton, Kristi Noem and Marco Rubio are all in their 40s. Tim Scott and Mike Pompeo are 50-something. Knocking 20 years off the age of presidential candidates wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen to America's politics.</p><p>Write henninger@wsj.com.</p>",
