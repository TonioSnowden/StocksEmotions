  "text": "<p>Hollywood studios' experiments with releasing new films on streaming services at the same time as their cinematic debuts have been a hit with investors and locked-down movie fanatics. </p> <p>But there has been a downside too. Known as “simultaneous release”, the strategy has led to near-instant availability of pristine pirated copies of films such as Disney's <em>Black Widow</em> and Warner Bros' <em>Godzilla vs Kong</em>, costing the studios millions per week in lost revenue. </p> <p>Copying a movie from streaming platforms can take “a couple of minutes or an hour at the most”, said the founder of piracy tracker TorrentFreak. Going by the pseudonym of <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/author/ernesto/\">Ernesto van der Sar</a>, he declined to be named, owing to the nature of his work. “That's the problem with these simultaneous release strategies.” </p> <p>Piracy tends to be higher for streaming, the studios acknowledge, since most use “4K” high definition standards — meaning the quality is extremely good. </p> <p>For struggling cinema owners, the studios' streaming piracy problems have been a blessing, however. Rampant piracy has helped them press their argument for keeping an exclusive theatrical “window”, which the simultaneous release strategy had threatened to close. </p> <p>Mark Zoradi, chief executive of Cinemark Holdings, the third largest cinema chain in the US, said piracy fears had recently persuaded studios to pull back on simultaneous release — at least for now. </p> <p>The National Association of Theater Owners, the US cinema owners' lobby group, has criticised what it regards as the studios' aggressive promotion of their proprietary streaming services — which include Warner Bros' HBO Max, Disney+ and ViacomCBS's Paramount+ — at the expense of the box office. But investors have cheered when studios report strong subscription numbers, even if the streaming services are not yet profitable. &#xa0;</p> <p>Two of Disney's Marvel movies appear to have helped make the case for preserving the theatrical window. After <em>Black Widow</em> was pirated from Disney+ on its opening in July, the family entertainment group tried a more traditional release for&#xa0;its latest Marvel movie, <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>, this month. </p> <p>The film had a strong showing at the box office, and while it has been pirated the quality of the illegal copies — shot by hand with camcorders —&#xa0; is relatively poor. &#xa0;</p> <p>Following <em>Shang-Chi's</em> successful release — it has pulled in $196.5m at the US box office and been the top movie in North America for four weeks — Disney announced that the rest of its 2021 film releases would&#xa0;have exclusive runs in cinemas before moving to streaming. </p> <p>Other studios, including Warner Bros, have made similar commitments into 2022. Disney has not revealed plans for next year. </p> <p>Zoradi argued that the strong performance by <em>Shang-Chi</em> — and a reduced instance of piracy with that release —&#xa0; had influenced studios' decisions to allow an exclusive run in the cinemas. </p> <p>“When you see movies that didn't go to simultaneous release, they tend to be less high on the pirated list than those that did,” he said at a media conference held by Goldman Sachs last week. “That was a really important factor in all the studios' decisions.”</p> <p>Disney did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Zoradi, who worked in&#xa0;studio distribution at Disney for almost three decades, said he had a “hope and expectation” that Disney would commit to exclusive theatrical runs next year. “I can't put words in Disney's mouth, but it was a very positive sign that [Disney chief executive] Bob Chapek decided to take all of the rest of 2021 and put exclusive windows on it.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The group has taken the hardest-charging approach to streaming among the Hollywood studios, as evidenced by a bitter legal dispute with <em>Black Widow</em> star <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1550ed57-047f-46dd-a9a0-121406199076\">Scarlett Johansson</a>. </p> <p>The A-lister alleges the group's simultaneous release of <em>Black Widow</em> breached her original contract, juicing Disney's stock price at her expense as her bonus was tied to box office sales. Disney said there was “no merit whatsoever” to the filing. </p> <p>But Disney+ has grown quickly during the pandemic, reaching more than 115m subscribers globally. </p> <p>Chapek said at the conference last week that Disney would be flexible with release windows in the future, with some as short as 30 days — a far cry from the 90 days cinema operators have traditionally enjoyed. </p> <p>Narrowing the exclusive cinematic window has been a goal of the studios for years. Preserving it will not end digital piracy of movies, but it will probably delay the length of time for high-quality copies to become available, argued Van der Sar. </p> <p>In the past, high-quality pirated copies of films did not begin to circulate until Blu-ray discs were released or they became available on demand. “It's not clear there's more piracy, it's just that the piracy happens sooner than it used to,” he added. </p> <p>Cinema owners, which have been struggling to regain audiences this year amid the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19, are celebrating the near-term commitments to preserving their theatrical windows. But they probably have not seen off simultaneous release strategies either, analysts said. </p> <p>Studios are expected to make some films exclusively for their streaming services, with Warner Bros planning some movies that will go straight to HBO Max. </p> <p>Chapek stressed “flexibility” in how Disney films will be released in the future, suggesting further experimentation ahead as it promotes its platform. </p> <p>“We love theatrical exhibition — we've seen the power of that over decades — but at the same time we know our service [Disney+] is strategically the most important thing that we are doing,”&#xa0;he said. </p><p>Source: Christopher Grimes in Los Angeles  2021 'Streaming piracy helps cinemas make case for exclusive theatrical ‘window'' FT.com 29 September.
