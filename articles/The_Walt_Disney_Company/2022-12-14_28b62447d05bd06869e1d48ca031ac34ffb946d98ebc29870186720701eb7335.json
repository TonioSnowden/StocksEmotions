  "text": "<h2>Newsies</h2> <h4>Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre, London</h4> <p>With sharp irony, <em>Newsies</em> — the 2011 US musical about newspaper boys on strike — makes its London debut amid rolling news headlines about major nationwide strikes in the UK. And, while it's set in New York in 1899, its depiction of what is essentially an exploitative gig economy feels uncomfortably familiar. Add to that a stirring story, a string of resonant themes and the sort of sizzling choreography and irrepressible performances that could burn through snow and you have the ingredients for a headline-grabbing hit. But as the newsies themselves would tell you, the headline isn't the whole story. </p> <p>The musical (inspired by the 1992 Disney film) pitches us into Lower Manhattan on the verge of a new century. Child labour is rife, nowhere more visibly than in the newspaper hawkers who risk life and limb to make a sale because taking back unsold copies will leave them out of pocket and out of food. It's bad enough that they have to pay 50 cents for their papers upfront.</p> <p>But when Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the New York World, decides to hike that upfront cost to 60 cents, the newsies take a stand. Led by 17-year-old Jack Kelly, they form an impromptu union and withdraw their labour, despatching delegates to urge other districts to do likewise. A sparky young female journalist makes them front-page news and all looks set fair. Until Pulitzer starts playing dirty. </p> <p>Cracking story, then, and some of the arguments could be ripped from today's pages. But for all its galvanising spirit, the piece (music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Jack Feldman, book by Harvey Fierstein) falls short dramatically. Some of the characters are — pardon the pun — paper-thin: Pulitzer practically invites pantomime boos, despite a performance of sleek menace from Cameron Blakely, and few of the newsies have much definition.</p> <p>The exceptions are Jack, who in Michael Ahomka-Lindsay's excellent performance is an impetuous, charismatic individual, combining sharp negotiating tactics with an artistic streak (he designs backdrops for a burlesque theatre — another storyline scarcely developed); Matthew Duckett's injured Crutchie; and thoughtful Davey (Ryan Kopel), who is a rarity among the boys in having parents and a younger brother.</p> <p>Bronté Barbé as sassy journalist Katherine has a witty number about writing a story and there's a love ballad between her and Jack. For the most part, however, what holds the show back is a lack of emotional depth and detail. The boys are orphans, poor, hungry, neglected — granted this is not the place for gritty naturalism, but we still need to feel the weight of that in more detail. And it all feels a bit relentless: more variation of tone would deepen it.</p> <p>It's lifted, however, by the restless, punchy choreography from director Matt Cole and the performances from the terrific young ensemble. Cole fills every corner of the vast Troubadour space and Morgan Large's industrial, grid-like set with action and the rebellious energy of youth. The dancers pour down the stairs, clamber over the railings, tap-dance on tables, soar across the space and swing from the light fittings. In the end, the show, rightly, belongs to them and they turn the mass energy of a young dance ensemble at full throttle into an uplifting metaphor for collective action.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>To April 16, </em><a href=\"https://newsiesthemusical.co.uk/home/\"><em>newsiesthemusical.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Mandela</h2> <h4>Young Vic, London</h4> <p>The potent force of dance as a symbolic expression of protest also powers through <em>Mandela</em>, the new musical from Laiona Michelle (book) and brothers Greg Dean Borowsky and Shaun Borowsky (music and lyrics), made in partnership with the Mandela family. This is a long-awaited project and a significant one, focusing on one of the most important and inspirational political figures of the 20th century. Again it's a musical with huge political import and resonance for the present day — it could be one of the events of the year.</p> <p>That it misses that mark is largely down to a curious detachment from its main subject. You depart from this show with little sense of having got close to Mandela the man, to his thinking or to what went on in his heart and mind during those 27 years of imprisonment. Neither do you get any detail about his African National Congress colleagues. There's a brief tussle of priorities when, after the brutal horror of the Sharpeville massacre, the protest movement switches to sabotage. There's a quick outline of the humiliation and torment endured at the notorious Robben Island prison. But in general this is too much of a broad-brush sweep through events.</p> <p>The focus is more on Mandela's family and the toll on them, with his daughters Zeni (Nomfusi Ngonyama) and Zindzi (Leanne Robinson) dreaming about meeting him and with his wife, Winnie, taking on the protest mantle. (The more troubling aspects of her role, such as the violence with which she was later associated, are touched upon but not explored in proper depth.) There is a lovely, lilting use of gently rippling chords — first introduced in a lullaby — to suggest love and loss.</p> <p>One moment that stands out is when Mandela's son, Thembi (played with touching, eager grace by Posi Morakinyo), dies in a car crash and Mandela is refused permission to attend the funeral. The letter that he writes, sung by the cast, is quietly moving. It's in scenes like this that you feel something of the cost to Mandela of his great struggle for freedom. </p> <p>Where the show does soar is in suggesting the spread of the protest movement, both in South Africa and wider afield, and the galvanising effect of Mandela's dignified example. Schele Williams's fluid direction creates expressive tableaux on Hannah Beachler's open set, which tells its own story: a glowing sky framed by barbed wire. And despite limited characterisation, Michael Luwoye brings immense gravitas to Mandela and Danielle Fiamanya a sense of inner turmoil to Winnie.</p> <p>Gregory Maqoma's choreography is exhilarating, responding to rousing protest anthems with blazing choral work, filling the stage with swirling song and motion. Prudence Jezile's Praise Singer often leads these moments, the cast following her in an outpouring of pain, defiance and hope. At moments like this, the show excels, becoming a stirring plea for humanity and justice. It's just a shame that that is not matched by the sort of narrative depth and intricacy that could make this a great musical.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>To February 4; online viewing January 19-23, </em><a href=\"https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/mandela#close\"><em>youngvic.org</em></a></p><p>Source: Sarah Hemming 2022 'Paperboy walkout makes for a striking musical in Newsies — theatre review' FT.com 14 December.
