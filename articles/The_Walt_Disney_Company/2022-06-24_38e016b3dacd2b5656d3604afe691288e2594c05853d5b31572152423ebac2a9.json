  "title": "Ruth Asawa, Modern Art Oxford review — a revelatory retrospective ",
  "text": "<p>From a distance, they look like things you'd find hanging in the dank of a jungle: bulbous, pendulous structures that might disgorge something terrifying. Walk closer and you're caught by the fluent intricacy of their construction — thousands of tiny wire links knitted together like chainmail, to create worlds within worlds, voids within voids. They seem somehow both soft and hard; as you move around them, they half-disappear, flickering in their own shadows. Are they mobiles? Sculptures? Organic forms, or abstract ones? Line drawings in space? In outer space?</p> <p>The Japanese-American artist Ruth Asawa made hundreds of these tied-wire sculptures over nearly 70 years, from the late 1940s to close to her death in 2013. Yet they, and she, are rarely seen beyond the US: this is the first time Asawa has been granted a museum retrospective outside North America.</p> <p>The scale and fragility of these pieces are no doubt something to do with it — the largest are several metres high — but it's hard not to think that there are more depressing reasons too: Asawa was a woman, she wasn't white, her art was tricky to categorise, she devoted most of her energies to education and activism in her native California rather than pursuing a New York gallery career. “She carved her own path,” says co-curator Emma Ridgway. “It's time we brought both her and what she did into the light.”</p> <p>This spacious and handsomely curated show at Modern Art Oxford, which will travel to Norway later in the year, makes it abundantly clear that Asawa deserves to be part of the tapestry of 20th-century American art, not least because she was connected with so much of it. Her early pieces show her straddling art, craft, design, scientific and architectural forms in ways that link Bauhaus principles with space-age minimalism. Among her teachers were the Bauhaus refugees Josef and Anni Albers, and she was so close to architect Buckminster Fuller that he designed her wedding ring.</p> <p>Her public art projects of the 1960s and 1970s, documented here, were light years ahead of their time in their generosity of community spirit. In an era of hulking Stellas and Serras, she built a fountain in San Francisco based on dough moulds created by schoolkids, and an unashamedly playful — and unfashionably figurative — one elsewhere in the city featuring frolicking mermaids and turtles. (“People probably thought she was crazy,” one of her daughters recalled.) </p> <p>In the 1950s, her wire sculptures were shown at New York's well-regarded Peridot Gallery; they also graced the pages of Vogue, alongside models in cloche hats and debonair greatcoats. They manage to look at home in both places. “From early in her career, she was questioning the boundaries of art, craft, design,” says Ridgway. “That opens things up. But it also makes it more difficult for people who prefer things in silos, as many critics did.”&#xa0;</p> <p>That Asawa became an artist at all is another paradox. Born in southern California to parents who emigrated from Japan and worked as farm labourers, after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 she and thousands of other Japanese-Americans were thrown into camps by the US government and remained in captivity until 1943. Despite the desperation of their plight, the teenage Asawa remembered this as a happy time: several Disney animators, who taught her to draw from nature and fired her love of art, were also interned. “I would not be who I am today had it not been for the internment, and I like who I am,” Asawa later said.</p> <p>Only much later, in the 1990s, did she confront her wartime experiences publicly, producing a sober bronze bas-relief in San Jose as a memorial for Japanese internees. Although realist, it's dominated by the latticed structure of a watchtower; maybe her fascination with criss-crossed forms wasn't so innocent.</p> <p>Forbidden from graduating in the fiercely anti-Japanese years postwar, she was encouraged to apply to Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where she flourished in the radically multidisciplinary environment: dance with Merce Cunningham, music with John Cage, architecture with “Bucky”, visual art with Willem de Kooning. Yet her most lasting mentor was Josef Albers, who pushed her to experiment with colour, block stamps and drawing. It was on a trip to Mexico with Albers that Asawa encountered traditional artists crocheting wire; the technique inspired her for the remainder of her life.</p> <p>It was also at Black Mountain that she met the man who'd become her husband, the architect Albert Lanier; in a moving letter to him on display here that gives the show its subtitle, she proclaims her artistic ambitions and determination to rise above conventional expectations of her gender and the racism that surrounded her on all sides. “I no longer want to nurse such wounds,” she wrote. “I now want to wrap fingers cut by aluminium shavings, and hands scratched by wire.” She would become a “citizen of the universe”, she added.</p> <p>The show includes a spread of work covering most of Asawa's career, from delicately shaded early drawings and riotous blockprints — heavily influenced by both Alberses, with a dash of de Kooning — through pieces that feel more particularly her own. In the 1960s she discovered electroplating and used it to enliven studies of desert plants she created from plaited wire; in the gallery, they have a sharp, sinister presence, <em>nature morte</em> for the atomic age. There are also structures based on origami, including an ingenious study for a fountain made out of folded paper, as well as images of a similar piece being used by dancers in San Francisco as a kind of costume.</p> <p>Asawa's teachers encouraged her away from natural forms and towards abstraction, and though she resisted you feel they were probably right: it's in the wire sculptures that her art seems most weird and most alive. One piece dominates the gallery, a five-lobed, 1.4-metre high “form within a form” from 1990 in which squat spheres of oxidised copper wire nestle within each other like pullulating amoebas. Another you have to squint at to appreciate: a dainty, gold-wire globe-within-a-globe tiny enough to sit in your palm (“Continuous”, 1981-82). Although beautiful, these pieces are never merely decorative. And never mind scratched hands; how Asawa's own fingers were precise enough to craft something like this is hard to conceive.</p> <p>“She embraces the physical pain of creating these things from wire,” says Ridgway. “It's very demanding manual labour; that makes their scale really fascinating.”</p> <p>Craft is, of course, the question mark that hangs over her. Like Anni Albers, a textile artist who was enormously successful in her own time and then neglected for decades, Asawa has only recently begun to achieve deserved art-world attention. Yet Asawa doesn't seem to have been especially concerned about how people labelled what she was doing: as in her sculptures, everything was braided together, interconnected. Making was enough. “Doing is living,” she once said. “That is all that matters.”</p> <p><em>To August 21, </em><a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/whats-on/ruth-asawa-citizen-of-the-universe\"><em>modernartoxford.org.uk</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Andrew Dickson 2022 'Ruth Asawa, Modern Art Oxford review — a revelatory retrospective ' FT.com 24 June.
