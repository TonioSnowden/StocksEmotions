  "text": "<p>Ms. Lovato, now 28, has lived the kind of life that's difficult for those not raised in the spotlight to understand. She was performing in beauty pageants in elementary school and was acting in television by her early teens. She became a star on the Disney Channel series \"Camp Rock\" and her debut album, the bubble-gum rock outing \"Don't Forget,\" appeared when she was 16. From the outset, the sheer force of her voice was remarkable, and it grew richer. By the time she was 18, she left a tour supporting the Jonas Brothers and entered rehab. In 2018, Ms. Lovato overdosed on opioids laced with fentanyl and nearly died, and the subsequent damage to her health was profound. And all of this horror occurred while Ms. Lovato was a famous pop star already in the tabloids, so fans and paparazzi alike scrutinized every detail of her trauma and recovery.</p><p>Ms. Lovato's previous album, 2017's \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" found her embracing R&amp;B and club-ready electronic pop, but \"Dancing With the Devil\" is much more subdued. It's a ballad-heavy set with many songs that feature vocals and pared-back arrangements, sometimes just a piano or acoustic guitar. The first three songs serve as a triptych as Ms. Lovato chronicles her descent to rock bottom. \"Anyone,\" which she performed at the Grammys in 2020, is a showcase for the force of her voice that also makes plain that music can't save her. \"I tried to talk to my piano,\" goes one line, and then later she admits \"I feel stupid when I sing,\" contrasting her internal misery with her crowd-pleasing role as an entertainer. In its honesty and expressive energy, it brings to mind Lady Gaga's epic \"Dope.\" The following \"Dancing With the Devil,\" an R&amp;B number built around a jazzy keyboard pattern, is about the slippery slope of alcohol and cocaine use, while \"ICU (Madison's Lullabye)\" describes Ms. Lovato's encounter with her younger sister in the hospital after the overdose.</p><p>A spoken snippet, \"Intro,\" takes the story from there, introducing what Ms. Lovato hopes is a new approach to life. The songs that follow are still filled with hard realities from Ms. Lovato's past, but now they're presented as something she can learn to live with. \"The Art of Starting Over\" begins this part of the record on a high note with a breezy and confident groove that brings to mind Fleetwood Mac. \"Lonely People\" is a pop-rock singalong with a killer chorus, and \"The Way You Don't Look at Me\" is a whispered ballad with a finger-picked acoustic guitar in which Ms. Lovato confronts issues with body image. She explores that theme further with the midtempo number \"Melon Cake,\" which describes the visual centerpiece of her childhood birthday parties, a watermelon with candles in it, a substitution for baked goods to keep her \"Barbie-sized.\"</p><p>\"Finally get to do things my way\" is how she sings her way out of \"Melon Cake,\" and the rest of the album finds Ms. Lovato trying new things to see how they fit into her life, including dating women -- see the folk-pop \"The Kind of Lover I Am\" and the grinding \"My Girlfriends Are My Boyfriends,\" which features a guest spot from rapper Saweetie -- dismissing a lover who isn't good for her (\"15 Minutes\") and, disconcertingly given the context of the album, experimenting with moderate marijuana use on \"California Sober.\"</p><p>\"It ain't black or white,\" she offers on the last of these, adding that \"history was always repeating, not anymore.\" One hopes so, for Ms. Lovato's sake. The second half of the record has too many songs, like the piano ballad \"Easy\" and the midtempo \"Butterfly,\" that fit the general theme but are unimpressive musically. It would have been a better album had it been a third shorter, but considering what's at stake for Ms. Lovato, that seems beside the point.</p><p>Given her dark past and her life as a celebrity, it's fair to ask who most benefits when she presents the trauma of her life as pop-culture entertainment. She's trying to heal by working through her struggles in public, and perhaps for someone who has lived her life in front of cameras that's the only way. But there are times on \"Dancing With the Devil\" where it feels as if we shouldn't be listening, and that by doing so we're joining the image-obsessed forces that led her to a place where she almost died. For some, that unease will hover over this project, even when the music is powerful.</p>",
