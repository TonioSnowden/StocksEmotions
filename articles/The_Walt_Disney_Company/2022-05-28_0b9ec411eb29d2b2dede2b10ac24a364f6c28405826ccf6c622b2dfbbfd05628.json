  "text": "<p>Thomas S. Murphy, a jovial Brooklyn native who liked to call people \"pal\" or \"kiddo,\" had a talent for making and keeping friends. One of them was Warren Buffett.</p><p>In his late 20s, after he graduated from Harvard Business School, Mr. Murphy's network of pals led him to a job managing a tiny, failing UHF television station in Albany, N.Y.</p><p>That business became Capital Cities Communications Inc. Led by Mr. Murphy, it bought TV stations around the country, diversified into newspapers and cable TV, and in 1985 agreed to acquire the much bigger American Broadcasting Cos. for $3.5 billion.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. -- headed by Mr. Buffett -- helped finance that deal by investing $517.5 million and acquiring an 18% stake in Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</p><p>A decade later, in 1995, Mr. Murphy agreed to sell Capital Cities/ABC to Walt Disney Co. for about $19 billion, then the second-largest acquisition in U.S. history.</p><p>Mr. Murphy died May 25 at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 96.</p><p>Those who bought stock in Capital Cities in 1957, Mr. Murphy calculated, would have reaped $2,000 in 1995 for every $1 originally invested.</p><p>He attributed his success to a knack for salesmanship and good judgment. \"One of the most uncommon things in life,\" he said in a 2000 interview at Harvard Business School, \"is common sense.\"</p>",
