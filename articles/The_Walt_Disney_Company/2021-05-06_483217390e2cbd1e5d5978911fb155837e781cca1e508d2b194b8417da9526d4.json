  "text": "<p>\n  Here are three new releases streaming this week: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Mythic Quest' </p><p>\n   (Apple TV+) </p><p>\n   Rob McElhenney runs an old show and a new show. The old one is \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" (Hulu), about a group of friends who run a bar and which is 14 seasons deep. Mr. McElhenney calls the dark comedy \"a show about people who never grow or learn anything or will ever change and evolve.\" </p><p>\n  The new one, \"Mythic Quest,\" is a workplace comedy that does almost the opposite: It's about a company that makes videogames where change, learning and being there for each other are central to the premise of the show. The second season, which takes place as the company returns to the office after working remotely during the pandemic, begins streaming Friday. </p><p>\n  \"Mythic Quest\"\" depicts the workplace as a loving, if rather dysfunctional family. In many ways, Mr. McElhenney says \"Mythic Quest\"\" is inspired by the real-life workplace of his other show \"Sunny,\" where cast and crew don't just get along, they love each other, vacation together, even marry and have children together (he and co-star Kaitlin Olson are married). </p><p>\n  \"I knew I wanted to make a show that navigated all of those things,\" Mr. McElhenney says. \"And then, of course, pushed it into other areas -- into the hyper dramatic, into the silly and more fun aspects that you need in a successful television show.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Star Wars: The Bad Batch' </p><p>\n  (Disney+) </p><p>\n  Although live-action movies and series like \"The Mandalorian\" have dominated the Star Wars narrative in recent years, there's long been a healthy franchise of animated shows that star or intersect with characters from the films. It started in 2008, with \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" (7 seasons, 133 episodes), and includes \"Star Wars Rebels\" (4 seasons, 75 episodes) and \"Star Wars Resistance\" (2 seasons, 40 episodes). </p><p>\n  The latest animated series, \"Star Wars: The Bad Batch,\" started streaming this week with a 70-minute premiere. It picks up at the end of the movie \"Revenge of the Sith,\" (the third film of the second trilogy) with the Emperor disbanding the Republic and creating an Empire. The series follows Clone Force 99, an A-Team-esque band of \"enhanced\" clones. The crew becomes skeptical of the emboldened regime they once killed for., particularly after an enlightening conversation with Saw Gerrera, a rebel fighter in the prequel movie, \"Rogue One.\" Head writer and executive producer Jennifer Corbett teased that Gerrera may not be the only film character that the crew will encounter in the season. </p><p>\n  \"The best thing about this time period is the Empire has a ways to go before they reach the galactic domination that you see in 'Rebels' and the original trilogy,\" she says. \"So, our group will definitely be interacting with many people along the way.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Girls5eva' </p><p>\n  (Peacock) </p><p>\n  \"Girls5eva,\" a new comedy out today, considers what would happen if a one-hit-wonder from the halcyon days of '90s era pop groups tried to give it another go. </p><p>\n  The show begins when the women of Girls5eva -- a group that once promised it was \"gonna be famous 5eva, 'cause 4eva's too short\" -- return to the zeitgeist two decades later after a rapper samples one of their songs. The four surviving members find themselves in the same room together for the first time in years and plot a comeback. The group features Renee Elise Goldsberry as Wickie, the one who went solo; Paula Pell as Gloria, who became a dentist; Busy Philipps as Summer, the one who doesn't do much singing; and Grammy-winner Sara Bareilles as Dawn, a married mother of one who had been planning on making it two before the reunion. </p><p>\n  \"As a woman in my forties, I thought it would be fun to write versions of myself,\" says creator Meredith Scardino, who came of age when Spice Girls ruled the Earth. Ms. Scardino says she was interested in writing about mistakes she and her friends made as they came up in the world and then seeing how \"these ladies find their voices when they try again to do something hard.\" </p><p></p>",
