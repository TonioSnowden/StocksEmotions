Here's why investors are still confident in the supply/demand setup for oil and energy stocks.</p><p>Looking at the worst-performing sectors, you might wonder why the consumer discretionary and communication services sectors fared worse than information-technology, the core tech sector. One reason is that S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices can surprise investors with its sector choices. The consumer discretionary sector includes Tesla Inc. TSLA and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, which has fallen nearly 50% this year. The communications sector includes Meta Platforms Inc. META, along with Match Group Inc. MTCH, which is down 69% for 2022, and Netflix Inc. NFLX, which is down 51% this year.</p><p>There were many reasons easy to cite for Big Tech's decline, such as a questionable change in strategy for Facebook's holding company, Meta, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has put so much of the company's resources into developing a new world that most people don't wish to enter, at least yet. Meta's shares were down 64% for 2022.</p><p>You might also blame the Twitter-related antics and sales of Tesla shares by CEO Elon Musk for the 65% decline in the electric-vehicle maker's stock during 2022. But Tesla had a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 120.3 at the end of 2021, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX traded for 21.4 times its weighted forward earnings estimate, according to FactSet. Those P/E ratios have now declined to 22.1 and 16.8, respectively. So Tesla no longer appears to be a very expensive stock, especially for a company that increased its vehicle deliveries by 42% in the third quarter from a year earlier.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet expect Tesla's stock to double during 2023. It nearly made this list of 20 EV stocks expected to rebound the most in 2023.</p><p>The worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks of 2022</p><p>Here are the 20 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that fell the most for 2022. </p><p> Company                               Ticker  2022 price change  Forward P/E  Forward P/E as of Dec. 31, 2021  Generac Holdings Inc.
