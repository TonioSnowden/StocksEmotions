  "title": "Grammys 2022: Silk Sonic's 'Leave the Door Open' Wins Song of the Year During Glitzy Las Vegas Show; Olivia Rodrigo wins best new artist at the Grammys, her first win in one of the four major categories",
  "text": "<p>Introducing the duo, Trevor Noah, of \"The Daily Show,\" who played host for the second year in a row, joked that Silk Sonic seemed to have brought back not just a '70s sound, but rampant inflation, too.</p><p>That wasn't the only news item Mr. Noah quickly nodded at. He and others at the ceremony made jokes about the now infamous \"Oscars slap\" which has been a kind of elephant-in-the-room during the evening.</p><p>\"It's going to be such a beautiful evening,\" Mr. Noah said, adding that \"we're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths.\" Celebrities Questlove and LeVar Burton, who hosted the pre-televised portion of the ceremony, where most of the night's 87 awards are handed out, also landed quips. Mr. Burton, for example, instructed the crowd to \"stay in your seats and keep your hands to yourself.\"</p><p>Mr. Noah also referenced the pandemic. \"People are doing shots,\" he said, comparing audience members drinking to getting Covid-19 vaccines. </p><p>Other early performances included Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, BTS and Lil Nas X, with Jack Harlow.</p><p>Ms. Rodrigo, wearing a white dress and combat boots, performed her chart-topping hit \"drivers license,\" beginning her moody performance in a car amid a suburban scene. </p><p>Ms. Rodrigo was considered a front-runner for many important awards, thanks to her breakout success last year. </p><p>Ms. Rodrigo won the best new artist award, her first win in one of the four major categories.\"This is my biggest dream come true,\" she said.</p><p>The Disney teen star had been up for seven awards, including the four most prestigious ones—album of the year, song of the year, record of the year and best new artist. She lost song of the year to Silk Sonic, however.</p><p>Jon Batiste, the jazz musician and bandleader of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" was among the show's big early winners, scoring four awards, including best music video and best American roots song. Mr. Batiste has the most nominations of any artist, at 11.</p><p>Sunday's ceremony marks several firsts for \"music's biggest night.\" This year, there are 10 nominees for the top four honors, up from eight last year and just five before 2019. It is a move designed to recognize a broader array of musicians and help repair the credibility of the televised show.</p><p>Also, for the first time in decades, the awards process has been entirely left to voters: Last April, the Recording Academy, which runs the Grammys, removed their controversial nominations-review committees, which for years have had final say over many nods. The undisclosed memberships of these committees had fueled concerns about voting improprieties.</p><p>Many people in the music business have applauded the move, but the risk is the Grammys will become more of a popularity contest and less distinguishable from other shows, Grammy watchers say. For example, seven of this year's 10 nominees for album of the year are among the most talked-about musicians of 2021: Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Lil Nas X, Doja Cat and Kanye West.</p><p>The Grammys have long been a lightning rod for complaints. Over the years, critics have assailed everything from the show's recognition of Black and hip-hop artists and female performers to its transparency on voting processes.</p><p>The Grammys, which were originally scheduled for Jan. 31 but delayed because of the pandemic, come at a period of transition for the broader music industry.</p><p>Revenues in the U.S. record business continue growing at a healthy clip, thanks to streaming, along with new sources such as TikTok, video games and fitness apps.</p><p>The concert industry, for its part, gradually re-opened last summer and fall and is now bracing for potentially record-breaking year in 2022. Yet Covid-19 remains a major concern for musicians and concert-executives alike.</p><p>Some performers are concerned about performing shows for maskless crowds, as safety rules ease. Others are canceling shows because of fresh Covid-19 infections in their touring parties. Meanwhile, the recent jump in gasoline prices, along with other costs, could hold some consumers back from spending on concert tickets just as the crucial summer season gets under way.</p><p>Other early winners on Sunday evening included Foo Fighters, which won three rock-related awards, in the wake of the death of their drummer, Taylor Hawkins.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What songs did you find most notable over the past year in pop music? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Kanye West, who recently changed his name to Ye, earned two awards, for best rap song and best melodic rap performance, giving him 24 career awards–and tying him with Jay-Z among hip-hop artists. Tyler, the Creator won best rap album for \"CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST,\" one of the most critically-acclaimed hip-hop albums of the past year. </p><p>Chris Stapleton picked up three country-related awards, and New York-based musician Arooj Aftab won for best global music performance. Joni Mitchell, in one of her recent rare public appearances, accepted an award for best historical album.</p><p>Write to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com</p><p>Grammys 2022: Silk Sonic's 'Leave the Door Open' Wins Song of the Year During Glitzy Las Vegas Show</p>",
