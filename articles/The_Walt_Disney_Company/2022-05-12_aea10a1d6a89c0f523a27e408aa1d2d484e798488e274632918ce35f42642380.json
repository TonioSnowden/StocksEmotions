  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 509 points, or 1.6%, to 31,330.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 61 points, or 1.7% at 3,873</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP shed 175 points, or 1.5%, to 11,195.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 327 points, or 1.02%, to 31834, the S&amp;P 500 declined 66 points, or 1.65%, to 3935, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 373 points, or 3.18%, to 11364.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has dropped around 18% from its record high set on Jan. 3. A close at or below 3,837.249 would put the large-cap benchmark into a bear market — defined as a drop of 20% from a recent peak.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks were lower in afternoon trade, following fresh economic data that showed slowing wholesale inflation in April, but still intense price pressures. Meeting forecasts, prices rose 0.5% in April, from a 1.6% jump in March. Price gains over the year slowed to 11% from 11.5%.</p><p>While inflation data released Wednesday may have shown a peak in price growth, the figures were hotter than forecast. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food and tends to be a better predictor of future inflation, surprisingly accelerated in April.</p><p>\"At least it's peaked, for now,\" said Eric Lynch, managing director at Scharf Investments, about the inflation readings. \"The question is do we go to 4% relatively quickly or 6%?\" he said by phone.</p><p>He also said it \"matters a lot where we land,\" particularly as higher grocery bills, elevated gas prices and soaring rents translate to stretched paychecks. \"It's probably safe to say we're not getting to 4% too quickly.\"</p><p>On the labor front, weekly jobless claims rose 1,000 to 203,000 in the week ended May 7, the Labor Department reported.</p><p>High inflation also means the Fed \"might have to tighten too much leading to a sharp economic slowdown, but it also means that the economic projection in tech and some other assets are now seen as far too optimistic,\" said Sebastian Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>\"Equity analysts adopting fixed income speech call it a long duration equity that is long on hope as forecasting past two years is very difficult when the wave of liquidity/narrative is no longer so supportive.\"</p><p>Lynch called current market pressures the \"other side of the slope,\" or a reversal of when Main Street was collapsing early in the pandemic but Wall Street was rising. \"I think there's a lot of concern about earnings and a recession as interest rates rise.\"</p><p>Related:An inventory crunch is making life impossible for home buyers.

Chief Executive Elon Musk's takeover of the social-media giant.</p><p>* Beyond Meat Inc. BYND shares were off 2% Thursday after the company said it got a revenue got a boost from the launch of Beyond Meat Jerky, through a collaboration with PepsiCo Inc., PEP, but making the product hurt margins for the quarter.</p><p>* GameStop Corp.GME shares were up 8.9% and those of AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC rose 3.6% as meme stocks enjoyed an upswing.</p><p>* AmerisourceBergen Corp.

COIN shares were 0.4% higher Thursday, but down more than 75% on the year, in the days after the company's CEO repeated that bankruptcy is not likelydespite the plunge in crypto assets from recent highs.</p><p>How are other assets doing?</p><p>* Oil futures flipped higher, with the U.S. benchmark CL up 0.3% at $105.99 a barrel.
