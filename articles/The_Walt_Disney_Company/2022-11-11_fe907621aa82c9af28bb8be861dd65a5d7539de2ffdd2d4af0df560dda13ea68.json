  "text": "<p>Monday, February 26 1973: a drizzly, dreary day. As darkness fell and London's commuters trudged towards their trains, the evening papers made for depressing reading. With world commodity prices soaring, inflation was heading towards double figures. Living standards had stagnated; the banking system was under severe strain; the nation's finances seemed increasingly imperilled.</p> <p>Worse, the Edward Heath government's latest effort to hold down pay increases had provoked fresh unrest from the trade unions. The very next day, half a million people, from civil servants and NHS workers to train drivers, firefighters and car workers, were due to walk out. Both the British Rail network and the London Underground were facing shutdowns and, with experts warning of chaos on the roads, thousands of workers were expected to stay at home.</p> <p>Today, almost 50 years later, all of this might sound bleakly familiar. But at least the downcast commuters of 1973 had something decent to watch. For in a grimly ironic twist, the highlight of that Monday night's television schedules was a BBC film celebrating London's first Underground line: the Metropolitan Railway, the original artery of the capital's commuter network.</p> <p>Written and presented by the poet Sir John Betjeman, <em>Metro-Land</em>&#xa0;follows the line from Baker Street to Buckinghamshire, tracing a path through the suburban mosaic of Modernist stations and manicured golf courses, mock-Tudor villas and Art Deco cinemas. In just under an hour, the places flash by — St John's Wood, Wembley and Pinner, Harrow, Rickmansworth and Chorleywood — their very names charged with gently romantic melancholy, as if mourning the lost promise of commuter bliss.</p> <p>“Child of the First War, forgotten by the Second, we called you Metro-land,” says Betjeman sadly. “We laid our schemes, lured by the lush brochure, down byways beckoned, to build at last the cottage of our dreams.” On cue, the picture shows a clipping from the 1920s, advertising a mock-Tudor semi in “Harrow Garden Village”, on an “ESTATE of OPEN SPACES and CHARMING COUNTRY HOUSES”.&#xa0;</p> <p>It sounds delightful, and I looked it up on Google Maps. “Open spaces?” Well, not quite. It's just off Rayners Lane, in a classic interwar maze of bay-windowed Tudorbethan semis. You could&#xa0;hardly find a more suburban scene: the front gardens tarmacked over to provide space for two family cars, the windows lined with white net curtains, the lonely trees spaced at regular intervals, a&#xa0;red-brick facade here, a splash of pebble-dash there. This is how millions of English families live. This is, or at least was, Daily Mail country.</p> <p>Popular culture in the 1970s was rarely kind to the capital's commuter belt. Intellectuals had long seen it as the embodiment of narrowness and materialism, middlebrow conformity and architectural banality. Yet after Betjeman's tribute to Wembley and Chesham, even suburbia's most virulent critics put their hatred aside. In The&#xa0;Observer, Clive James called the film an “instant classic”, and predicted that it would be repeated “until the millennium”. </p> <p>But the review Betjeman liked best came in affectionate verse from his friend, the&#xa0;Evening Standard's Simon Jenkins: “For an hour he held enraptured/ Pinner, Moor Park, Chorley Wood./ ‘Well I'm blowed,' they said. ‘He likes us./ Knew one day that someone should.' ”</p> <p>What&#xa0;<em>was&#xa0;</em>Metro-land? Betjeman's film calls it the child of the Great War, but that's only half right. Its roots went back to January 10 1863: the day the Metropolitan Railway, with its steam locomotives and dingy gas-lit carriages, became the world's first underground line, whisking passengers from Paddington to Farringdon. The line reached Hammersmith a year later, Richmond in 1877 and Harrow in 1880. On the face of it, then: just another Victorian railway boom.</p> <p>But there was a difference. Unlike other railways, which were legally obliged to get rid of land they no longer needed, the Metropolitan was allowed to hold on to land adjoining its new branches. With demand for housing growing, the commercial possibilities seemed limitless. As early as 1887, the railway company's directors established a Metropolitan Surplus Lands Committee to cash in, and by the early 1900s they were building their first housing estate in Pinner.</p> <p>In 1904 they published their first&#xa0;<em>Guide to the Extension Line</em>, encouraging Londoners to take weekend trips on the Metropolitan Railway, with lists of country walks, bicycle routes, Chiltern guesthouses and even local foxhunts. The Metropolitan Line was a chance to escape your daily hell and if you just happened to see a house you fancied on a brand-new railway-built estate — well, so much the better.</p> <p>In 1915 the brochure acquired a new name: no longer the unglamorous&#xa0;<em>Guide to the Extension Line</em> but the catchy, almost Modernist&#xa0;<em>Metro-land</em>. Although Britain was at war, the Metropolitan's directors were planning for peace. Neasden, Wembley Park, Rickmansworth, Rayners Lane: these, they thought, were the honeypots of the future.</p> <p>They were right. By 1929 the Metropolitan had begun work on 11 more estates, including a luxury apartment block at Chiltern Court, Baker Street, where Betjeman kicks off his televised odyssey. Other developers followed suit, tens of thousands of suburban semis spreading out into what had once been the sleepy fields of Middlesex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. And by the time Britain entered the Great Depression, Metro-land was no longer a marketing man's dream, but millions of commuters' daily reality.</p> <p>What did Metro-land&#xa0;<em>mean</em>? A simple way to understand it is to walk down a quiet residential street in Wembley Park, Pinner, Kenton or Chesham, taking in the Tudorbethan houses, the gently curving avenues, the pockets of greenery, the lingering traces of woodland alongside the shopping parades and golf courses. Another is to flick through one of the Metropolitan's brochures from their 1920s heyday, with the promise of bow-windowed, fake-timbered paradise amid the miraculously untouched fields and coppices.</p> <p>The obvious irony is that Metro-land was a product of urban modernity. It was London, with its chaos and clamour and crowds, that had made it possible. No Metropolitan Railway, no Metro-land. Yet the genius of the railway's campaign was to tap Londoners' deep nostalgia for what they thought they had lost: a kinder, gentler England of babbling brooks and sun-dappled woodlands.</p> <p>The humourist George R Sims called it “a land where the wild flowers grow/ Near, near at hand if by train you go”. Another popular lyricist, Boyle Lawrence, produced a ditty entitled “My Little Metro-land Home”. The cover of the sheet music shows a mock-Tudor cottage at the end of a rural lane, and this was what people thought they were buying: their own little place in the lost English countryside, complete with a golf course, a cinema and a reliably fast connection to the capital. </p> <p>None of the advertising brochures, however, acknowledged that other people might be moving there too. As the railway historian Christian Wolmar wryly remarks: “The world of Metroland is not cluttered with people: its suburban streets are empty [ . . .] There are, it seems, more farm animals than people.”</p> <p>Even at the time, critics found Metro-land laughably fake — a British equivalent of the Disney World residential communities that followed. As early as 1928, Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel&#xa0;<em>Decline and Fall</em>&#xa0;featured an intolerably stuffy politician who is ennobled as Viscount Metroland. Six years later, the composer Constant Lambert mocked “the hideous faux bonhomie of the hiker, noisily wading his way through the petrol pumps of Metroland, singing obsolete sea chanties with the aid of the Week-End Book, imbibing chemically flavoured synthetic beer under the impression that he is tossing off a tankard of ‘jolly good ale' ”.</p> <p>In fact, by this point Metro-land was already a bit of a joke. When the Metropolitan merged with the other Underground lines in 1933, its new bosses wasted little time in dropping the label. And by the aftermath of the second world war, with a Labour government committed to building a new Jerusalem of council houses for all, Metro-land had almost vanished from the national conversation.</p> <p>Yet today, 100 years after Metro-land's heyday, it's easy to see why it was so successful. The early decades of the last century were a golden age of housebuilding. For much of this period, interest rates rarely went above 5 per cent and for most of the 1930s, the Bank of England's base rate was fixed at a steady 2 per cent. </p> <p>In three decades, the population of Harrow Weald increased almost tenfold, while Pinner's population surged from 3,000 to almost 25,000. Today more than 3mn British households live in buildings constructed between 1919 and 1939, many of them in precisely the kind of mock-Tudor suburban cottages you find in Metro-land's advertisements.</p> <p>What was more, this suburban vision perfectly captured the mood of the age. Read the speeches of the outstanding politician of the interwar years, three-time Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin, and you find yourself in a kind of rhetorical Metro-land, almost instinctively blending nostalgia and modernity. </p> <p>Baldwin was an industrialist who spent most of his time in London and had mastered the new medium of the wireless; but he sold himself as a man of the shires with a tweed suit and an old-fashioned pipe.</p> <p>In his most famous speech, in 1924, he told his listeners that England meant “the tinkle of hammer on anvil in the country smithy, the corncrake on a dewy morning, the sound of the scythe against the whetstone, and the sight of a plough team coming over the brow of a hill”. </p> <p>This was pure Metro-land — and what made it pure Metro-land is that it was aimed at modern middle-class voters in Ruislip, Neasden, Chesham and Amersham, listening to their radios in their neat new sitting rooms and dutifully voting for the Conservative candidate on election day.</p> <p>By the time Betjeman made&#xa0;<em>Metro-Land</em>, all this belonged to the day before yesterday, that most unfashionable time of all. Indeed, his film's appeal depends largely on its elegiac tone: it opens in a deserted restaurant at Chiltern Court, and ends amid the fields and birdsong of the disused Metropolitan station at rural Verney Junction, Buckinghamshire, which had been closed to passengers since 1936. </p> <p>“The houses of Metro-land never got as far as Verney Junction,” Betjeman says thoughtfully. “Grass triumphs, and I must say I'm rather glad.”</p> <p>But I think it would be wrong to overdo the melancholy. Chiltern Court still stands, though it's changed a good deal from the days when literary celebrities such as HG Wells and Arnold Bennett lived there. The restaurant where Betjeman began his journey is now a Wetherspoons. But is that decline, or simply evolution?</p> <p>And what about Metro-land itself? Lined with fried chicken shops and Polish delicatessens, Wembley, Neasden and Harrow are less genteel than in their Great War heyday. But the further out you go, the more the planners' original vision endures. Reach the Chilterns — Chorleywood, Chesham, Amersham — and you find yourself in a familiar landscape of Tudorbethan shopping parades, half-timbered villas, golf courses and prep schools, a remarkably unchanging vision of Baldwin's England.</p> <p>It's the kind of landscape urban intellectuals have always mocked as twee and inauthentic. But when a place has existed for more than a century, it seems a bit dense to question its authenticity. And suburbs wouldn't exist unless ordinary people liked them. </p> <p>“The Ruislip Station Estate, on which these delightful houses are located, has everything in its favour,” says one advertisement from the 1920s, promising a “real worthwhile ‘quality' seven-room house for £695”. The estate, it continues, “can be reached from Town in less time than it takes to read your evening paper. On all sides are green fields and pleasant hedgerows. The climate is mild and equable; the air is healthy and invigorating whilst unlimited facilities for outdoor recreation obtain […] particularly liberal educational and shopping facilities.” Isn't that what most of us want, deep down?</p> <p>Above all, in one crucial respect, Betjeman was wrong. The implication of that scene at Verney Junction was that Metro-land had reached its terminus, and suburban sprawl had found its limits. But has it?</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, for example, estate agents talked of a&#xa0;“race for space”, as families deserted the inner cities for homes with&#xa0;larger gardens, more room for working from home and more green space nearby. In Leicester, for example, prices went up by 6.5 per cent; in nearby rural Rutland and Melton, they went up by 22 per cent. </p> <p>Even at the&#xa0;beginning of this year, according to Savills, regional prices were growing three times more quickly than London prices. For the young, cities will never go out of fashion. But with working from home more popular, Britain's future looks ever more suburban.</p> <p>Back, though, to that&#xa0;last scene at Verney Junction. Metro-land was a creation of the railway, but by the time Betjeman was filming his final piece to camera, it was the car, not the train, that was remaking life in Britain. Drive north from Verney Junction through the north Buckinghamshire countryside, and after half an hour you reach the centre of Milton Keynes. </p> <p>True, Britain's joint-newest city is a product of the 1960s, not the 1920s. But with its blend of innovation and nostalgia, its emphasis on privacy and domesticity, its combination of fast transport links, public amenities and affordable family housing, its ethos isn't so different from those first estates in Pinner and Wembley.</p> <p>So grass didn't win, after all. Metro-land won. And one way or another, I suspect, we'll all end up there eventually.</p> <p><em>Dominic Sandbrook is a British writer and historian</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftproperty\"><em>@FTProperty</em></a><em> on Twitter or </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ft_houseandhome/?hl=en\"><em>@ft_houseandhome</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p> <p><strong>Letters in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a67c961-42e9-4b67-8598-64a694e9daf4\"><em>Betjeman's disdain for ‘first modern house in England' / From Michael Tremblay, University of Kent, UK</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af41170f-24f3-4489-b5b0-390775ed3af1\"><em>Milton Keynes pioneered ideas of urban liveability</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af41170f-24f3-4489-b5b0-390775ed3af1\"><em>From Steve Osgood, Bath, Somerset, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Dominic Sandbrook 2022 'Revisiting Metro-land: is the future suburban?'
