  "title": "The Mom-and-Pop Operation That Sent Ireland's 'Flying Doctor' to Beijing; Before getting to Beijing, Elsa Desmond had to first set up Ireland's luge federation and finish medical school",
  "text": "<p>Desmond, sometimes called \"The Flying Doctor,\" is also afraid of heights and flying on planes. Yet she competes in one of the Winter Games' most teeth-rattling sports. In luge, athletes thunder down the track at more than 80 mph lying on their back, feet first, on a small sled. The sport is often called Formula One on ice.</p><p>Olympians from unlikely backgrounds—the Jamaican bobsled team in 1988, a Nepalese bricklayer in cross-country skiing in 2014 and a Saudi skier at these games—are a Winter Games tradition. Like them, Desmond isn't among the top favorites in Beijing.</p><p>But the fact that she made it here is victory enough for the 24-year old. Born in England, she got into luge when she saw the sport on television in the 2006 Winter Olympics. As a teenager at a British Army camp, Desmond saw an ad for winter-sports training and signed up. She first competed for Great Britain as a junior but later wanted to represent Ireland, with her paternal grandmother hailing from the Irish town of Ballyjamesduff.</p><p>Ireland, though, isn't a powerhouse in winter sports. It has never won a medal at the Winter Olympics. It didn't even have a luge federation.</p><p>So the Desmond clan set up one, with Elsa as the sole athlete and development program manager, her father as the chairman and her mother the treasurer. That wasn't an easy feat as the Desmonds had to learn about funding, administration and logistics of a sports federation on the go.</p><p>\"It's been a lot more work than I had realized it was going to be,\" she said in a video by the Olympic Federation of Ireland. Most of the day-to-day operation of the federation falls on her.</p><p>The Desmond-led luge federation has been looking for new recruits since then, advertising to recruit \"high adrenaline activities like roller coasters and waterslides.\"</p><p>Changing countries meant that she could band together and pool resources with other smaller countries like Bulgaria, Bosnia and Moldova, who all travel and train together, with some support from the International Luge Federation.</p><p>But there was another catch. Desmond had to finish medical school first.</p><p>\"I was always revising, sometimes writing essays in the car between tracks,\" she said.</p><p>She took her final medical exams online during luge competitions in Latvia and Germany in 2021, hanging a \"Do Not disturb\" sign in six languages on her hotel door.</p><p>Desmond had planned to take two years off from her medical studies to concentrate on the Beijing Games, but as the pandemic was raging, more doctors were needed to help out.</p><p>Medical internships in the U.K. usually take two years, but her hospital, in Essex, England, extended her trial by a year to allow her to compete in China.</p><p>She was going in on weekends and outside the normal hours to make up for the hours that she was missing. Her career goal, besides luge, is to become an anesthetist.</p><p>\"Combining her busy National Health Service work during the pandemic with the demands of being an elite athlete is an immense achievement and I am delighted that she has managed to succeed in both,\" said David Walker, the chief medical officer at the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust.</p><p>In Beijing, Desmond, whose Instagram profile is @elsas_no_princess, a play on the eponymous character from Disney's hit animated film \"Frozen,\" is competing in the women's singles race starting Monday. Her main aim in China is to gain experience ahead of her next big goal: the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games.</p><p>\"The world has given me every excuse to give up along the way,\" she said. \"The fact that I didn't is the thing I'm most proud of.\"</p><p>Desmond, who was Ireland's flag bearer at the Opening Ceremony on Friday, won't stay for the closing event, however. Her first shift back at the hospital is on February 11.</p><p>Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com</p><p>The Mom-and-Pop Operation That Sent Ireland's 'Flying Doctor' to Beijing</p>",
