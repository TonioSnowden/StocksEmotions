  "text": "<p>Skellig Michael, eight miles off the southwestern coast of Ireland, is now best known as a location in the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. Luke Skywalker, however, was not the first to seek refuge on the remote, craggy island. In the seventh century, a small group of monks founded a monastery there, before 13th-century climate change forced the order to relocate to the mainland.</p> <p>Their story forms the backdrop to Emma Donoghue's new novel, <em>Haven</em>. Its setting proves to be as stark and claustrophobic as that of her celebrated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/735be0a2-abe9-11df-bfa7-00144feabdc0\"><em>Room</em></a> (2010). But whereas the Skellig monastery is believed to have been founded by 12 St Fionan's monks, Donoghue restricts her complement to a mere three. Unlike their originals, who raised livestock and traded with local communities, her monks survive on the birds and fish they can catch and the vegetables they can harvest, as they turn their backs on the secular world.</p> <p>Their leader is Artt, a celebrated scholar and “one of the band of solitaries who've been carrying the light of the Gospel from Ireland across a pagan-gripped continent”. He envies the Desert Fathers of early Christianity in their harsh hermitages and, with no deserts to be found in Ireland, he seeks to live on an uninhabited island, one “less tainted by the world's breath”.</p> <p>Artt, who inspires a mixture of awe and unease among the brethren of the mainland monastery in which he is staying, persuades the abbot to let him take two monks, the elderly Cormac and youthful Trian, on his mission to the island. While at sea, Cormac feels that “their journey is a fable”. For the reader, it is one that neatly illustrates Diderot's axiom that “from fanaticism to barbarism is only one step”.</p> <p>Unlike Artt, who was “fostered out to a holy man at the age of seven”, neither Cormac nor Trian has a strong sense of vocation. Cormac, whose wife and children died of the plague, took vows after being injured in a skirmish with a rival clan and saved by the healing skill of a monk. Trian, a dreamer, is not yet 20. His parents placed him in the monastery at the age of 13 for his own protection. Bored by his everyday life, he regards his involvement in Artt's mission as an adventure, “like a heroic deed out of a song”. </p> <p>Artt's fanaticism drives the novel like Captain Ahab's in <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Although Trian and Cormac are loath to challenge him, Donoghue subtly ensures that the reader, under no such vow of obedience, comes to question his motives, which, for all his professions of humility, seem dangerously close to arrogance. Artt's faith in divine providence, admirable when they sail into uncharted waters and he asserts that “God is our pilot now, and we'll go wherever his breath blows us”, grows ever more unhinged. </p> <p>After landing on Skellig, he declares, “This place was set aside for us when the earth was made.” Later, as they engage in a mass slaughter of birds for food, fuel and candle grease, he claims, “This whole island's like one great banquet table that God's spread for us.” This is definitely not a book for vegans.</p> <p>The bulk of the narrative describes the day-to-day hardships the men endure as they battle against the very nature that Artt maintains God has fashioned for their benefit. Artt, who views suffering as a good in itself (“Pain's a privilege, a gift, a grace”), forces the bitterly cold and badly malnourished Trian to spend days in semi-darkness, copying out the Psalter, even when he suspects that he may simply be compounding the previous copyist's errors. When Trian runs out of vermilion, Artt tells him to use his own blood. “‘Don't cut your fingers,' the Prior warns him, ‘or you could smear the copy.'” Instead, he orders him to make a slit under his tongue.</p> <p>Like Jill Dawson in the recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d1694f5-fe07-4b87-9742-976916ec167b\"><em>The Bewitching</em></a>, Donoghue excels in creating not just a world but a worldview that is far removed from our own. On the one hand, this can be seen in Cormac's stories of the legendary feats of Celtic saints such as “holy Breandán”, “blessed Comgall” and “holy Brigit”, which leaven the narrative, and in statements such as Artt's that “a woman is a botched man, created only for childbearing”. On the other, it is manifest in the two monks' compliance with their prior's most crazed commands. This is a world in which doubts are viewed not as a necessary adjunct of faith but as “the foul whisperings of demons”.</p> <p>The one false note in the book is the eleventh-hour revelation of Trian's androgyny, which serves little purpose and seems sensational. Otherwise, this is a bold, thoughtful novel, whose austerity matches its setting.
