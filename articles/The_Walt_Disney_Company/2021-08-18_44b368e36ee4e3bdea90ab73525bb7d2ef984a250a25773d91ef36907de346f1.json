  "text": "<p>In 1805, an American named Lodowick Post was hunting a fox across a beach, unowned land at the time. Finally, after exhausting what a court would later call the “wild and noxious beast”, an opportunistic hunter named Pierson swooped in and killed the fox, taking its pelt as his prize. Post was furious and sued Pierson for the pelt, believing he had been robbed of his rightful trophy.</p> <p>The judges disagreed and by siding with Pierson established in US law “the rule of capture”. Ownership would not go to those who had created the circumstances for getting hold of something — whether a pharmaceutical patent, drilling an oil well or catching king crabs off the coast of Alaska — but those who actually did. Michael Heller and James Salzman, authors of <em>Mine!</em>, argue this represents the principle of “first come, first served”. It is one, the two American law professors write, of only six stories we use to justify ownership, including “possession is nine-tenths of the law”, “you reap what you sow”, “my home is my castle”, “our bodies, our selves” and “the meek shall inherit the earth.”</p> <p>Their book's strength is showing how often these stories come into conflict and how supposedly fundamental principles of fairness fail to provide a solid foundation for property rights. Take “possession is nine-tenths of the law” which the authors examine via a US legal principle known as “adverse possession”. This allows those who physically have and use an object to establish their rights over it, say a path through someone else's land. If the legal owner does not put up a fence and exclude the walkers, then, through continuous use, ownership will eventually transfer to those who actually make use of it.</p> <p>Fair enough, perhaps, when it comes to establishing a public right of way. But under this same principle would the rightful owner of looted African treasures be the western museums that have continuously possessed and used them for centuries?</p> <p>A riposte to that might be “you reap what you sow” or the notion that something belongs to its creators, or at least to their descendants, ownership can be established through labour and inheritance rather than possession. The Benin bronzes in the British Museum were created by the people of west Africa and therefore they are the rightful owners. A strong argument, but one you might not be so happy to advance when it comes to copyright, where, as the authors point out there is little case for the US congress to keep extending these legally sanctioned monopolies. Thousands of books, they estimate, from the 1920s and 1930s are now “orphan works”, out of print because it is far too expensive for publishers to track down heirs of heirs. Such rules benefit the few, helping Disney still profit from Mickey Mouse, while depriving the rest of us.</p> <p>Heller and Salzman show that these stories are often a cloak to disguise that decisions on ownership are nothing more than picking a winner and a loser. A common thread is that we should think less about who “deserves” to own something than the kind of society it incentivises. The “rule of capture” may be good if you want more fishing but is less useful for the environment — Alaska no longer uses the rule to decide who gets the king crabs, partly for sustainability but also because it encouraged dangerous fishing practices.</p> <p>The authors similarly argue ownership is not a binary “on/off switch” but has gradations more like a “dimmer switch”. Judges who ruled that cancer patients had no long-term rights over self-replicating strains of cells taken from them without their knowledge by doctors, as it would dissuade medical research, should have said instead that, in concert with the “our bodies, our selves” story of self-ownership that the original donor had some residual rights, perhaps royalties or an ability to rule out certain uses.</p> <p>If all that sounds like hard work, it should not. The book is a work of “pop law”, similar to “pop economics” such as <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman. <em>Mine!</em> is enjoyable, well-written and with a deftness of touch that belies the radical re-examination of property rights at its heart. It is hard to come away without reconsidering how you feel about problems as everyday as putting towels on sun loungers or foraging for berries, but also bigger questions of bodily autonomy and land ownership. This is one book you will not feel sorry to capture for yourself or, perhaps more appropriately, borrow from a library.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786497786?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1786497786\"><strong>Mine!</strong></a><strong> How the Hidden Rules of Ownership Control Our Lives</strong> by Michael Heller &amp; James Salzman, <em>Atlantic £16.99/Doubleday $28.95, 324 pages</em></p> <p><em>Gavin Jackson is an FT leader writer</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Gavin Jackson 2021 'Mine! — degrees of possession' FT.com 18 August.
