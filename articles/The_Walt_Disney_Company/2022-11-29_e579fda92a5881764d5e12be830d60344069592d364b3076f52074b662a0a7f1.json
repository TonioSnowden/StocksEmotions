A lawyer for Black, Susan Estrich, said the latest allegations against her client “are categorically false and part of a scheme to . . . destroy his reputation”.</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter:</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>H2O: bye-bye Bruno?</p></li>  <li><p>The activist fight that has Wall Street's attention</p></li>  <li><p>Paris Saint-Germain seeks market's approval</p></li> </ul> <h1>Crastes finds himself under the financial guillotine&#xa0;</h1> <p>Back when he was still riding high,<strong> Bruno Crastes</strong> was happy to hit out at regulation.</p> <p>When the tanned and silver-haired chief executive of <strong>H2O Asset Management</strong> picked up an award for his market-beating returns in 2018, the Frenchman used his acceptance speech to assert that his industry had become “corrupted by all this regulation and all this risk management”.</p> <p>Now, four years later, Crastes is facing the prospect of being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/041946c4-aac5-4d5a-bf0b-68f2596401dc\">banned from the investment industry</a> by his home country's financial regulator for a decade.</p> <p>On Friday, France's <strong>Autorité des Marchés Financiers</strong> recommended a record €75mn fine for H2O, alongside a €15mn fine on Crastes and a €3mn penalty for the firm's chief investment officer, <strong>Vincent Chailley</strong>. It's also seeking to ban Crastes from managing funds or an investment firm for a decade.</p> <p>What prompted the downfall of Crastes and H2O, which at its peak managed more than €30bn and was widely feted as one of the top- performing asset managers in Europe?</p> <p>It all started when the FT decided to carry out a little due diligence.</p> <p>Back in 2019, DD's Rob Smith and Cynthia O'Murchu from the FT's investigations desk pored over H2O's fund filings and made a startling discovery: the firm had well over €1bn invested in illiquid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51b425fc-94b6-3cc5-a4ea-47d72dca5e75\">bonds linked to <strong>Lars Windhorst</strong></a>, a German financier with a chequered past that included a criminal conviction.</p> <p>The reaction was immediate: investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86031b78-a237-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d\">yanked €8bn</a> from H2O's funds, while billions of euros were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9390e0e8-9357-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271\">wiped off the market value</a> of French bank Natixis, which first seeded the firm back in 2010.</p> <p>Yet, while H2O withstood the initial fallout — during which Crastes even publicly praised Windhorst as “extremely talented” — the French regulator on Friday laid bare a series of “grave” rule breaches at the firm. An official from the AMF argued at a public hearing in Paris that H2O wasn't even authorised to hold such illiquid bonds in retail funds in the first place.</p> <p>Despite continued revelations in the FT in the three years since its initial exposé, H2O still managed north of €12bn at the last count. Those loyal clients now face a decision.</p> <p>On Monday, H2O sought to reassure them that the regulator hadn't accused it of committing fraud, describing the alleged infractions as concerning “essentially technical matters” in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2aacd956-afaf-475c-a0a2-896f74fc41a0\">letter to clients</a>. We'll discover just how technical the matter was when the AMF finalises its penalties in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, the episode is another reminder of the importance of this newsletter's namesake: due diligence.</p> <p>During Friday's hearing, Crastes said that H2O didn't uncover any information about Windhorst's criminal conviction in research it carried out before first investing in bonds linked to the financier.</p> <p>DD would recommend that all of our readers incorporate a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=lars+windhorst+criminal+conviction\">simple Google search</a> into their due diligence process to avoid similar mishaps.</p> <h1>The ‘Trojan horse' debate captivating Wall Street</h1> <p>The high-finance version of “never get into a land war in Asia” might be “do not start a proxy fight in Orange County”, a top investment banker recently told DD. </p> <p>The posh OC has had its share of corporate battles over the years: <strong>Bill Ackman</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0ef215a-8a0b-11e4-9271-00144feabdc0\">2015 brawl</a> with Botox maker <strong>Allergan</strong>; a <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2013/11/15/emulex_caves_in/\">2013 boardroom scrap</a> between <strong>Emulux</strong> and <strong>Elliott Management</strong>; and <strong>Broadcom</strong>'s 2018 fight for<strong> Qualcomm</strong>. </p> <p>The latest Southern California brawl involves<strong> Masimo</strong>, a medical device maker with an $8bn enterprise value. Its antagonist, <strong>Politan Capital Management</strong>, a new hedge fund launched by veteran activist <strong>Quentin</strong> <strong>Koffey</strong> of Elliott and <strong>DE Shaw </strong>fame, is seeking a seat on its board.</p> <p>The fight has yet to even reach the proxy stage. Rather, as DD's Sujeet Indap writes, Masimo is challenging Politan to reveal details about itself — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428b3258-0b1b-4bc9-ba9c-a9df62af1f06\">including who exactly its financial backers are</a>. </p> <p>Koffey could be a “Trojan horse” representing “sovereign entities that do not respect — and have attempted to steal — intellectual property belonging to US companies”, Masimo has speculated in legal filings.</p> <p>These so-called “advance notice” provisions in corporate bylaws are being litigated in Delaware: companies say they should have the right to ask for detailed information about potential dissident investors. Activists say these rules simply stifle shareholder democracy.</p> <p>The fight has captivated the elite lawyers and bankers who advise on proxy fights. Semafor reported that the boardroom stalwart <strong>Wachtell Lipton </strong>decided against working with Masimo because it found the bylaw provisions to be too extreme for its tastes. Another top corporate defender, <strong>Sidley Austin</strong>, raised eyebrows by publishing a public memo speculating that Masimo <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/law-firm-sidley-warns-clients-about-rules-that-may-hinder-activists-2022-11-18/\">had flown too close to the sun</a>.</p> <p>Masimo is working with <strong>Paul Hastings</strong>, which recruited star M&amp;A lawyer<strong> Eduardo Gallardo</strong> from <strong>Gibson Dunn</strong> earlier this year along with litigators at<strong> Quinn Emanuel</strong>.</p> <p>The Masimo/Koffey quarrel comes during a particularly heated moment in corporate activism: a new so-called “universal proxy card” rolled out by the US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> has made it easier than ever for shareholders to run against company-backed directors.</p> <p>Masimo isn't the only company hopping on the defence. While these kinds of disputes often settle before court rulings, all eyes will be on the fight as investors and lawyers wonder whether corporate America has finally taken it too far.</p> <h1>PSG plays for Premier League-level cash</h1> <p>France is the undisputed minnow of Europe's “big five” football leagues, but<strong> Paris Saint-Germain</strong> isn't letting that get in the way of a chunky target valuation.</p> <p>The French champions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fc68e1a-769f-4b55-b6f7-ffceb31f23e9\">are in talks to sell up to 15 per cent</a> of the club at a valuation of more than €4bn, PSG president<strong> Nasser al-Khelaifi</strong> told the FT. That would be a big boost for <strong>Qatar Sports Investments</strong>, which bought PSG for about €70mn back in 2011. </p> <p><strong>Chelsea FC</strong>, you'll recall, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73bd5718-cbf5-407c-88d9-46c45577be24\">went for £2.5bn</a> this year in a takeover led by US billionaire <strong>Todd </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7257acdb-d96d-491c-8e68-82e11d8e424d\"><strong>Boehly</strong></a>. And that's a club in the <strong>English Premier League</strong>, Europe's richest by some way.</p> <p>A €4bn valuation would put PSG on seven times trailing revenues of €556mn, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/814a821e-5405-4166-8ac9-e4ab96dea8e4\">even more than Chelsea received</a>, as Lex notes. That'd be a nice chunk of change considering dealmaking has slowed just about everywhere else.</p> <p>Paying around €400mn or so for a tenth or so of a business is of course a far different proposition to shelling out for a full takeover. PSG's fortunes will be closely watched by <strong>Manchester United</strong> and <strong>Liverpool</strong>: England's two-best known clubs are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cabce4d0-2782-422a-8af7-fe6fb2ab86b5\">also considering their options</a>.</p> <p>But there's another reason why investors might be willing to bet on PSG. In the landscape of European football, al-Khelaifi has a better vantage point than most. </p> <p>He runs one of the region's top clubs and knows the French league, chairs the influential <strong>European Club Association </strong>and broadcaster<strong> beIN Sports</strong>, and sits on the executive committee of European football's governing body <strong>Uefa</strong>. </p> <p>The former professional tennis player, a crucial force in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\">repelling the breakaway</a> European Super League last year, has been central to building PSG into an attractive home for star players. Before the Qataris showed up, PSG hadn't won the domestic league title since 1994. These days<strong> Lionel Messi</strong>, <strong>Neymar</strong> and <strong>Kylian Mbappé</strong> play up front.</p> <p>Even so, investors must weigh up whether PSG can defy its role as a big fish in a small pond — or decide that France's <strong>Ligue 1</strong> has seen the bottom after a tough pandemic.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Marlboro cigarette maker <strong>Philip Morris International</strong> has made <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221125005286/en/Philip-Morris-International-Announces-New-Regional-Structure-and-Senior-Management-Changes-to-Accelerate-Growth-Toward-a-Smoke-Free-Future\">a number of changes</a> to its senior management ahead of a potential takeover of smokeless tobacco group <strong>Swedish Match</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>French satellite operator<strong> Eutelsat</strong> has appointed<strong> Christophe Caudrelier</strong>, previously an operating partner at <strong>Tikehau Ace Capital Partners</strong>, as chief financial officer.
