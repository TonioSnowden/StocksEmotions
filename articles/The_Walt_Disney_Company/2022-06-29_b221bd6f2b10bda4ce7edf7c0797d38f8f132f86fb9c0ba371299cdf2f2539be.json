  "title": "'Top Gun' Is Acing Its Theater Run; Paramount's goal to maximize theatrical returns should inspire other studios to be more flexible in streaming plans",
  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Should studios push movies to streaming services or maximize their time in theaters? Why? Join the conversation below.</p><p>As the first sequel to a 36-year-old Cold War hit, such a level of success for the latest \"Top Gun\" was by no means assured. But the movie seems to have done well at attracting masses beyond those already venturing back into theaters for the latest comic-book adaptations. Melissa Thomas, chief financial officer for the Cinemark theater chain, told an investor conference earlier this month that \"more than 25% of our customers that came to see 'Top Gun' had not visited a Cinemark theater in the past year, and more than 30% of those customers were over the age of 55.\"</p><p>Such a success is also a major score for Paramount Global, whose namesake studio hasn't had a $1 billion hit since 2014's \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" It should also serve as validation of the company's unique decision regarding the streaming future of its latest blockbuster. Paramount has been observing a 45-day window for keeping its movies in theaters before moving them to its Paramount+ streaming service. But the company maintained from the beginning that it planned to let \"Top Gun: Maverick'' stretch its wings for a longer theatrical run of an unspecified length.</p><p>That should give Paramount the best of both worlds: a highly profitable theatrical run and a movie that will still work as a high-profile addition to its streaming offering. Rivals should also take note. In a rush to capitalize on streaming hype, many Hollywood studios have shortened their theatrical windows to feed high-profile content to their streaming services. Disney reorganized its entire corporate structure in late 2020, citing its direct-to-consumer platforms that include the popular Disney+ service as the company's new \"primary focus.\"</p><p>But investors have soured on the economics of streaming lately, especially after Netflix seemingly hit a wall. And the intense focus on streaming by many studios may have trained viewers that they can easily wait out shortened theatrical windows. Disney's \"Lightyear\" was released earlier this month and is the first movie from the company's Pixar unit that it has launched into theaters since the pandemic began; the last three Pixar films went straight to Disney+. The movie also has been a relative disappointment, generating less than half the domestic box office in its first two weeks of release compared with the last two films in the \"Toy Story\" franchise, according to the industry-tracking site The Numbers.</p><p>One problem even Tom Cruise can't shoot down is the movie theater industry's growing reliance on a dwindling pool of blockbusters. Despite the massive success of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" this year's domestic box office so far is still 37% below the $5.7 billion averaged by this point in the three years before the pandemic, according to Box Office Mojo.</p><p>That is driving chains like Cinemark and AMC Entertainment to build up businesses showing alternative content such as concerts, plays and esports events. Cinemark said on its latest quarterly call in May that a livestreamed concert in March by K-pop phenomenon BTS generated $33 million in box-office sales in just two performancesâ€”more than the latest \"Top Gun\" made all of last weekend. Even Maverick has to face the music eventually.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>'Top Gun' Is Acing Its Theater Run</p>",
