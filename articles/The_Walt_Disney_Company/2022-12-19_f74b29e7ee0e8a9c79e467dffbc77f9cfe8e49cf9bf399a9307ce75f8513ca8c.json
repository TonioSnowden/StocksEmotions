  "title": "'Avatar' Leads but Misses Big Hopes",
  "text": "<p>The $134 million in domestic opening weekend ticket sales represent Mr. Cameron's best-ever box-office debut but fell short of tracking estimates based on advance ticket sales, which had projected the film would earn between $150 million and $175 million in North America.</p><p>The movie, which was shot in 3D and shown on more than 1,500 IMAX screens worldwide, earned $57.1 million in China, a result Disney described as disappointing, especially given the runaway success of the first movie in the franchise in China.</p><p>The \"Avatar\" sequel marks for Disney a crucial return to China, where government authorities haven't given Disney permission to release any of its Marvel superhero movies, the company's most reliably profitable theatrical titles, since 2019.</p><p>The new \"Avatar\" film tells the story of Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, a human who has assumed the body of a warrior leader of the Na'vi -- a race of giant, blue forest-dwellers from the fictional moon-world Pandora. He flees to the ocean to protect his family from rapacious earthlings who want to kill him and harvest Pandora's natural resources.</p><p>The original \"Avatar\" film, released in 2009, opened to $77 million domestically and went on to become the highest-grossing movie ever, with a cumulative global box office gross of nearly $2.9 billion. About $259 million of that total came from China, where audiences queued up for hours and some paid scalpers exorbitant ticket prices to get into the country's first-ever 3D IMAX movie.</p><p>This time around, audiences in China largely stayed home for fear of contracting Covid-19, Disney said. As of 10 days ago, only about 35% of cinemas in China were open, due to strict government lockdowns designed to bring the number of new Covid-19 cases to zero in the country, but about 80% were open for the movie's debut, said Tony Chambers, Disney's global head of theatrical distribution.</p><p>\"The problem is nobody wants to go to the cinema, because they've been told that Covid is extremely dangerous,\" Mr. Chambers said. \"Although cinemas are open, the appetite for going to them isn't really there.\"</p><p>Disney is hopeful the movie will benefit from a long period of high demand, as did the first \"Avatar\" movie, both at home and abroad. Mr. Chambers noted that it faces very little competition from big-ticket blockbuster movies for the next few weeks, which include the winter holidays and the lead-up to China's Lunar New Year celebrations, a period when movie theaters see an uptick in holiday traffic.</p><p>\"This isn't only about opening weekend,\" Mr. Chambers said. \"We have the screens, we have no competition and we have a clear run through the holidays.\"</p><p>At theaters in Shanghai, showings weren't at full capacity. Some fans who did show up said they thought carefully about potential exposure to the coronavirus.</p><p>\"I talked to my friends about the Covid situation we are facing now, but loosening is the current trend,\" said Tang Zhiwei, an 18-year-old student in Shanghai, who paid $37 for a ticket. \"We have to return to a normal life anyway.\"</p><p>Song Ningxin, a 27-year-old Beijing resident, said she went to see the movie because there are few other entertainment activities in the Chinese capital right now beyond dining out and going to the movies. She was one of just six people watching a screening on opening day, and the film left her a little disappointed.</p><p>Movie ticket sales in China suffered this year after Chinese authorities imposed extensive lockdowns and testing requirements that created a drag on the economy. The government announced this month it was dropping many of the restrictions, just as outbreaks were surging across the country.</p><p>\"Avatar will definitely be a highlight and a test of whether audiences will respond and the numbers bounce back again,\" said Kenny Ng, a film professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.</p><p>Both \"Avatar\" films proved crucial to the growth of IMAX Corp., a film exhibition technology company that allows movies to be shown on much larger screens.</p><p>When the first one came out, there were 14 IMAX theaters in China, compared with 800 today, with 200 more in some stage of development.</p><p>The sequel grossed $48.8 million at IMAX theaters worldwide, with $15.8 million coming from China, the company said Sunday. Despite the limitations from Covid-19, the China haul represented IMAX's largest portion to date of the overall Chinese box office for an opening weekend, 27%.</p><p>---</p><p>Zhao Yueling and Qianwei Zhang contributed to this article.</p><p>---</p><p>Estimated Box-Office Figures, Through Sunday </p><p>Sales, In Millions </p><p>Film                            Distributor           Weekend*   Cumulative    % Change    1.
