  "text": "<p>   Before the call, Ms. McCarthy suggested Mr. Chapek address the grim news head-on. He instead wrote a script that spent more time praising the return of in-person events, such as live attractions at theme parks. </p><p>   The next day, Disney stock had one of its largest drops ever. Over the course of 20 months, prices had fallen from $201.91 a share to $86.75. </p><p>   Activists pounced. Trian Fund Management LP bought more than $800 million worth of Disney stock in the days following the earnings report. Mr. Peltz, the fund's co-founder, called Mr. Chapek to say he was acquiring a stake. He wanted a seat on Disney's board, and to see the company cut costs. </p><p>   In a matter of days, Mr. Chapek found himself standing between a panicked workforce and an investor community sensing blood in the water. On Nov. 11, he issued a memo to senior executives banning all but essential work travel and freezing new hires. Layoffs were likely, he added. </p><p>   On Nov. 16, Ms. McCarthy took matters into her own hands. Without having confronted her boss or seeking board approval, she called Mr. Iger to gauge his interest in returning as CEO. She caught Mr. Iger at a low point -- he had been telling friends he was more concerned over the direction of the company than ever. </p><p>   He also told them he was frustrated with the idleness of his post-Disney life. In early October, Mr. Iger had taken a trip aboard the Aquarius, his 150-foot yacht, around the Fijian islands and complained to friends that his wife, Willow Bay -- too busy with her job as dean of the communications and journalism school at the University of Southern California -- couldn't join him. </p><p>   Mr. Iger had an offer to be an adviser at private-equity firm Redbird Capital. On Friday, Nov. 18, Ms. Arnold called with her offer. </p><p>   That day, Mr. Cramer, who is a close contact of Ms. McCarthy's, said on CNBC that he had heard Mr. Peltz had taken a position in Disney: \"Disney needs his help. This current crew just isn't cutting it.\" </p><p>   On Sunday, Nov. 20, Ms. Arnold called to tell Mr. Chapek his services were no longer needed. </p><p>   The news broke as a group of Disney executives gathered at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for Elton John's final U.S. concert, which was being streamed live on Disney+. Mr. Chapek, a big fan of the singer-songwriter, had planned to attend. He never made it. </p><p>   A week later, Mr. Iger held a town-hall meeting in the Burbank headquarters that was live-streamed to far-flung employees. He pledged that storytelling and creativity would be at the heart of Disney's mission. </p><p>   The returning CEO inherits a set of big problems: Empty rooms at theme-park hotels, the long closure of Shanghai Disney and movie theaters in China, and Wall Street demands to see profits in the streaming division. On top of that, Mr. Iger has told the board he has another focus -- finding a successor, again. </p><p>   Winning back disgruntled fans might be his easiest chore. </p><p>   On a Saturday afternoon in December, Mr. Iger walked Main Street in Southern California's Disneyland, flanked by executives, his wife and security guards wearing earpieces. </p><p>   \"I love you!\" passing fans yelled. Some stopped for selfies and autographs. </p><p>   Mr. Iger looked ecstatic, leaving associates to wonder if he ever plans to leave. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sarah Krouse, Suzanne Vranica and Lauren Thomas contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
