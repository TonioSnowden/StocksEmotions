  "title": "Disney heir comes out as transgender, denounces Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill; Charlee Disney wishes they could have done more to advocate against Florida's law, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in March",
  "text": "<p>The policy has drawn intense scrutiny from people across the U.S. who argue it marginalizes LGBTQ+ people, and from Florida teachers and parents who believe the law is vaguely worded and could impact how families are discussed and history lessons are taught.</p><p>Charlee Disney, a 30-year-old high school science teacher who uses they/them pronouns, told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published this past weekend that they hadn't done enough to lobby against the bill.</p><p>\"I feel like I don't do very much to help,\" they said. \"I don't call senators or take action. I felt like I could be doing more.\"</p><p>Charlee Disney said they came out as trans four years ago. Charlee's great-grandfather was Roy O. Disney, the older brother of Walt Disney; the two co-founded the company together.</p><p>\"I had very few openly gay role models,\" Charlee Disney said. \"And I certainly didn't have any trans or nonbinary role models. I didn't see myself reflected in anyone, and that made me feel like there was something wrong with me.\"</p><p>The Disney family announced it would donate up to $500,000 to the Human Rights Campaign, one of the country's biggest LGBTQ advocacy groups, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>See also: Walt Disney World's latest attraction may appeal to its own workers: Affordable housing</p><p>Many people, including Disney employees, criticized Disney CEO Bob Chapek for not making a statement condemning the bill prior to its passing. \"You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,\" Chapek said as part of a statement in March.</p><p>Disney employs 70,000 people in Florida and is an active political donor. The company donated $4.8 million to Florida candidates in the 2020 elections.</p><p>The Disney company released a statement denouncing the bill after it passed, prompting DeSantis to say that the company had \"crossed a line.\"</p><p>Disney heir comes out as transgender, denounces Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill</p>",
