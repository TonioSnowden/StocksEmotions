  "text": "<p>Ms. Cameron-Doe is set to succeed Craig Billings, who will follow Matt Maddox as chief executive, effective Feb. 1. Mr. Billings, also an Aristocrat alumnus, has served as Wynn's CFO since 2017.</p><p>Mr. Maddox last month told analysts that he was leaving because he had achieved his goals as CEO over the past four years, including stabilizing the business after company founder Steve Wynn resigned in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>Wynn said Ms. Cameron-Doe will join the company once she completes her notice period with Aristocrat, where she has held senior finance roles since 2013. Prior to Aristocrat, she worked at the Walt Disney Co., travel website Orbitz LLC and professional-services firm KPMG.</p><p>\"Julie is a proven leader and is a sitting public company CFO,\" Mr. Billings said, according to a press release. \"Coming from the gaming industry, she understands many aspects of our business and she has diverse international experience.\" The company declined to comment beyond its release.</p><p>Wynn last month reported its revenue grew to $994.6 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to $370.5 million the prior-year period, when casinos struggled with reduced travel to Las Vegas due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company booked a net loss of $166 million for the quarter, narrower than its loss of $758 million the prior-year period, in part due to higher operating expenses for the casino and entertainment businesses.</p><p>Aristocrat said it is seeking a successor for Ms. Cameron-Doe and expects to provide an update in due course.</p><p>Ms. Cameron-Doe could take on some responsibility for the digital-gambling business based on her experience at a mobile-gaming technology company, said Dan Wasiolek, a senior equity analyst at financial-services firm Morningstar Inc. \"Long term this is likely still an important area,\" Mr. Wasiolek said.</p><p>Nina Trentmann contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com and Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>Wynn Names Gambling-Industry Executive as CFO</p>",
