  "title": "Rupert Murdoch should sell Fox or take it private ",
  "text": "<p>Almost two years have passed since Rupert Murdoch completed the master stroke of his career: selling most of his 21st Century Fox business to Disney <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0df4a5c0-7484-11e8-b6ad-3823e4384287\">for $71bn</a> at the absolute peak of its value.</p> <p>Many media barons have excelled at hoarding assets. Murdoch is one of a handful who managed a greater feat. He relinquished some of his empire at a time when he could hook a buyer ready to overpay.</p> <p>So as he reflects on that deal anniversary, Murdoch should enjoy the glow of satisfaction — and then call his bankers about the remnants of Fox, which includes news and sports cable offerings, a broadcast network and about 30 television stations.</p> <p>For the moment may have come to sell parts of it, or to take the whole of Fox Corporation private. Even if that does not manage to defuse <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eab68e1-7afb-4282-95fa-3149bd091efa\">the looming battle between Murdoch's children</a> over his corporate legacy, it would unlock some value, and help re-engineer Fox for the future.&#xa0;</p> <p>Amid the cacophony of controversy around Fox News, it is easy to lose sight of what Fox Corporation has become: the grizzled rump of a company that throws off steady profits, but is a pale imitation of what Murdoch stood for as a mould-breaking media pioneer. &#xa0;</p> <p>On air, much has been made of how Fox News is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86f8878b-cee9-4935-ab7e-655f3a6bd613\">worried about its right flank</a>, seemingly hostage to the post-presidential afterlife of Trumpism. As John Ellis, a former Fox consultant, <a href=\"https://41jellis.medium.com/the-trump-channel-9d7f38bbcc97\">wrote last year</a>: “the audiences programme the network, not the other way around”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Viewed as a commercial enterprise, the contrast is more stark. The Fox group has lost the edgy, stuff-your-conventions mentality that made Murdoch the supreme challenger to established US networks starting in the 1980s, and indeed in every media market he has ever entered.&#xa0;</p> <p>Far from a change maker, the core of Fox today is a classic defensive incumbent, hoping sports and news will help the lucrative pay-TV model endure against the odds.&#xa0;</p> <p>Fox's strongest parts are reliant on a shrinking cable subscriber base, serving an audience heavy with retirees. It boasts of pricing power to maintain sky-high profit margins (in <a href=\"https://investor.foxcorporation.com/static-files/b094c856-0629-4bea-a101-a0747275dc43\">excess of 50 per cent</a> for Fox News). It prides itself on low capital investment. In short, it is principally in the business of managing decline.&#xa0;</p> <p>Murdoch's son Lachlan, Fox's chief executive, talks with enthusiasm about the company's bets on the future: sports gambling, and an advertising reliant video-streaming service called Tubi.&#xa0;These are distinct strategies that might work. But so far investors are unconvinced. </p> <p>Even though its performance regularly beats Wall Street estimates, Fox's share price has fallen badly behind rivals such as Discovery and ViacomCBS, which laid out streaming strategies late last year.&#xa0;They have each doubled since November, while Fox has risen 15 per cent.</p> <p>To change the conversation, the Murdochs have three main options. One is to follow the advice of analysts at <a href=\"https://www.moffettnathanson.com/research.aspx?GUID=bd35cb0f-f784-42b8-9e0b-662eda72ed0b\">Moffett Nathanson</a> and try to sell Fox's broadcasting assets:&#xa0;the Fox network and television stations.&#xa0;The proceeds could approach $5bn, or even more in a good auction, and prune what investors see as deadweight.</p> <p>The second bolder option would be to sell all of Fox's legacy TV and cable businesses, or its most valuable asset, Fox News. This would raise a tidy sum, perhaps near $20bn, and might lower the temperature of an unrelenting family power tussle over Murdoch's legacy.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Murdoch's younger son James has developed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eab68e1-7afb-4282-95fa-3149bd091efa\">trenchant and increasingly critical views</a> about the news channel. He is unlikely to let the matter lie when he and his siblings take over control of the family trust.&#xa0;</p> <p>Selling Fox News might quell some family strife when its value is high. But it raises a tricky question: what would that leave? Moffett Nathanson expects Fox News to account for more than 100 per cent of Fox's total operating profits by 2024.&#xa0;</p> <p>It might make more sense for Murdoch to take Fox private. Shareholders would have to back such a move — the Murdochs have outsized influence over the company but not full voting control. But it has clear advantages.&#xa0;Lachlan Murdoch could restructure with more gusto, incubate the sports-betting and Tubi businesses, and take advantage of the other assets — including a US tax shelter — that the company believes are underpriced by the market.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Such a deal may be a tall order for Murdoch in his 90th year. But he has a record of shrewd gambles, and rivals have mistakenly written him off before. Just recall that Robert Maxwell, the late newspaper tycoon, dismissed Murdoch as a “moth-eaten kangaroo” — in 1969.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:alex.barker@ft.com\"><em>alex.barker@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>This article has been amended to correct an estimate of the worth of Fox's broadcasting assets.
