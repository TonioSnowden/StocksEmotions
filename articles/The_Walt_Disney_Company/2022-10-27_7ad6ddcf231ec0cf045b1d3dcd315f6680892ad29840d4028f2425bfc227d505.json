  "text": "<p>British media and telecoms group Sky became the latest company to suffer from a contraction in consumer and advertising spending in the latest quarter, amid squeezed incomes and tougher economic conditions.</p> <p>The company, owned by US media conglomerate Comcast, reported a 15 per cent fall in revenues in the three months to September, to $4.3bn which was below analyst expectations of $4.4bn, though revenue was flat when taking into&#xa0;account currency fluctuations. </p> <p>Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 16 per cent to $701mn, though this came in above consensus&#xa0;estimates. The decrease was largely driven by a fall in its consumer telecoms and broadcasting division, as well as its advertising income.</p> <p>Philadelphia-based Comcast acquired <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Sky_PLC\">Sky</a> in 2018, as it sought to expand its international footprint, but the group went on to struggle with higher costs and disruptions to sports broadcasting because of the pandemic. </p> <p>It is now grappling with high levels of competition against a backdrop of climbing interest rates, weaker consumer spending and significantly higher costs.</p> <p>Underscoring the challenging environment in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/98cdeda9-6175-4556-854f-f1044968abda\">Comcast</a> itself reported higher than anticipated revenue and earnings, with a particularly strong performance in its media and entertainment business NBCUniversal.</p> <p>“At Sky, our team continues to prudently manage through a difficult and rapidly changing macroeconomic and geopolitical period in the UK and Europe,” said Brian Roberts, chair and chief executive of Comcast. </p> <p>The company reported revenues of $29.9bn, above consensus estimates of $29.6bn, and adjusted ebitda of $9.5bn, above the expected $9.2bn.</p> <p>Revenues in the company's studios and theme parks businesses increased by 31 and 42 per cent respectively, suggesting consumer discretionary spending has so far escaped a severe hit despite mounting fears about a global recession.</p> <p>TV and music streaming companies faced a reckoning earlier this year when <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/2fa688f8-97f0-4596-a705-822b4a5f9d6f\">Netflix</a> revealed that its subscriber growth had stalled for the first time in a decade. Comcast's Peacock streaming platform, which competes with Netflix and Disney, gained 2mn new subscribers, to reach 15mn in the latest quarter.</p> <p>The US group — one of the last fully fledged media and telecoms conglomerates, offering cable and broadband alongside entertainment including films and television — reported modest growth in its bread and butter cable business, amid a challenging environment for US cable companies this year as competition intensifies and demand cools following the pandemic internet boom. </p> <p>The company gained 14,000 broadband customers in the quarter, down from 300,000 in the previous three-month period, and lost 561,000 video customers. Its revenue in the sector nevertheless came in line with industry expectations, at $16.5bn.</p><p>Source: Anna Gross 2022 'Sky hit by ad and consumer spending crunch despite return of sport' FT.com 27 October.
