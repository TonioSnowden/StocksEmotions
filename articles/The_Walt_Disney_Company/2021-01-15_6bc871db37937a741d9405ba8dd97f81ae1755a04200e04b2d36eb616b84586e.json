Washing the car was the highest earning task, with parents paying an average of £2.94, and mowing the lawn came second at £2.69.</p> <p>Ten-year-olds were found to be the most entrepreneurial age group, raising the most money by selling old computer games and books. </p><p>Source: Claer Barrett 2021 'Video games top the pocket money spending charts' FT.com 15 January.
