  "title": "Stock Futures Waver After Inflation Data; Tech stocks seen ticking lower after Nasdaq jumps over 2%",
  "text": "<p>Bond yields, which are near their highest levels since mid-2019, ticked up after the data. . Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.983% from 1.928% Wednesday. The yield on two-year notes, which are particularly sensitive to interest rates, rose to 1.452% from 1.346%.</p><p>Ahead of the opening bell, Twitter shares rose 8.5% after the social-media company said it had largely dodged the effect of privacy changes hurting Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Walt Disney jumped 7.6% after it reported 11.8 million new subscribers for its Disney+ streaming service in the fourth quarter. Uber Technologies, meanwhile, gained 4.5% after the ride-hailing firm said quarterly revenue climbed 83%.</p><p>Investors are training their eyes on inflation data due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The S&amp;P 500 has risen for seven of the past nine trading days, steadying after a rocky start to the year. But money managers say rapid gains in consumer prices could inject more volatility into stock and bond markets, as the Federal Reserve looks to tame inflation with higher interest rates.</p><p>Thursday's data are expected to show consumer-price inflation picked up again in January, to an annual pace of 7.2%. That would mark an acceleration from the 7% rate recorded in December, and the fastest pace since 1982.</p><p>If the inflation data show a faster rise in consumer prices than investors are expecting, yields would likely rise further, said Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>\"The market will think the Fed will have to tighten faster or maybe do a bigger rate rise,\" Ms. Simmons said, though she added that a half-percentage-point increase to the Fed's target rate in March is unlikely. She expects markets to remain volatile in the short term, but thinks the S&amp;P 500 will rise over the next year.</p><p>Among other individual stocks, Twilio jumped 19% premarket after the software company said revenue and profits topped analysts' forecasts. Mattel also topped forecasts, sending shares of the toy maker 11% higher. PepsiCo added 1.1% after raising its dividend and setting a $10 billion stock buyback program.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 was flat as gains for real-estate stocks offset losses for shares of media and financial-service companies.</p><p>Siemens rose 6.1% after the German industrial company said rising orders goosed quarterly revenue and profits. Société Générale said profits climbed in the final quarter of 2021, lifting shares 4.7%. Delivery Hero plunged 22% after the German food-delivery firm said it lost money in 2021.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite ticked up 0.2%. In Hong Kong, China Evergrande shares rose 5.4% after reports that the embattled property company plans to restore construction and sales activity, while refraining from a fire sale of its assets.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Waver After Inflation Data</p>",
