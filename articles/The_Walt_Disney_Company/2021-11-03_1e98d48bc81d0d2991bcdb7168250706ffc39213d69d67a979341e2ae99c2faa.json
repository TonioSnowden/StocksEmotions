  "text": "<p>Fox's cable programming unit, which includes the Fox Business Network and Fox Sports 1 channel as well as Fox News, pulled in $1.42 billion in revenue, up nearly 7% from last year. The easing of Covid-19 restrictions allowed for more sports. Fox also got a boost from pay-per-view boxing.</p><p>In addition, Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer streaming platform operated by Fox News, generated higher subscription revenue over last year, the company said. Tubi, Fox's entertainment streaming platform, also had a strong quarter.</p><p>Revenue from Fox's TV stations was $1.58 billion, up from $1.35 billion a year ago due to growth at Tubi and higher advertising sales as local markets recovered from the pandemic-induced restrictions last year. The company also benefited from a full college football slate, the Major League Baseball All-Star game and more scripted entertainment programming at its Fox Network.</p><p>Fox News parent Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp share common ownership.</p><p>In September, Fox said it acquired celebrity news platform TMZ from AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia unit, a move that would expand its digital media and unscripted content.</p><p>TMZ owns a popular website and produces several TV shows. Fox local-television stations carry the shows \"TMZ\" and \"TMZ Live,\" and TMZ has produced specials for Fox's entertainment unit, including \"Harry &amp; Meghan: The Royals in Crisis\" and \"UFOs: The Pentagon Proof,\" and a sports gossip show that is carried by the Fox Sports 1 cable network.</p><p>Co-founder and managing editor Harvey Levin, who launched TMZ in 2005 and serves as host of its TV shows, will remain in charge of operations.</p><p>Profit attributable to stockholders decreased to $701 million, or $1.21 a share, for the fiscal first quarter, from $1.11 billion, or $1.83 a share, in the year-earlier period. The decline was attributed to the absence of a $462 million gain from Walt Disney Co. related to tax liabilities from its sale of 21st Century Fox assets.</p><p>Adjusted net income was $1.11 a share, ahead of analysts' consensus expectations of $1.01 a share, per a FactSet poll.</p><p>Joe Flint contributed to this article.</p><p>Fox's Revenue Rises as Ad Sales Improve</p>",
