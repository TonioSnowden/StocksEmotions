The Premier League still faces a TV rights crisis</h1> <p>When half a dozen of England's biggest football clubs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cbef20a-7599-4580-82aa-2af383bd0f5a\">said</a> this month they wanted to join a <strong>European Super League</strong>, they added a caveat.</p> <p>The so-called “Big Six”: <strong>Manchester United</strong>, <strong>Manchester City</strong>, <strong>Liverpool</strong>, <strong>Chelsea</strong>, <strong>Arsenal</strong> and <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> would be guaranteed places in the new continental competition and play midweek matches. But they would still field teams in their national competition, the <strong>Premier League</strong>, on weekends.</p> <p>So why were the other 14 English top tier clubs so furious about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\">the breakaway project</a>?&#xa0;</p> <p>A key reason why broadcasters from around the world paid a whopping £9.2bn to screen Premier League matches between 2018 and 2021 is the intense battle to finish in the top four places. That earns a spot in the <strong>Champions League</strong>, currently the continent's top club contest.&#xa0;</p> <p>By removing the drama of European qualification, the Premier League would be left with a less enticing TV spectacle. The value of its media contracts would fall. The Big Six would grab the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e80299a4-8012-447a-8512-c24e149304b1\">Super League's riches</a>, while leaving the other English clubs with a poorer product to sell.&#xa0;</p> <p>What's more, there are accusations the Super League clubs acted in bad faith by stalling another important decision for months. The Premier League wants to scrap its upcoming UK TV rights auction, in favour of rolling over its existing £5bn deal with <strong>Sky</strong>, <strong>BT </strong>and <strong>Amazon</strong>.</p> <p>This move, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21317445-0535-4f4a-a56e-b7ea470a2d08\">still needs UK government approval</a>, would provide financial stability to English clubs that are set to lose an estimated £2bn in revenues due to the pandemic and at a time other leagues in Germany and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd616305-d335-4799-9564-1b0c4be956d9\">Italy</a> have seen the value of their TV rights contracts drop.</p> <p>According to people familiar with the discussions, some top clubs asked for more time to consider the TV sales plan, only to announce they were joining the Super League.</p> <p>While the Super League <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3ab9f68-65b2-4839-96b3-ec4d2928053b\">collapsed quickly</a> in the face of vehement opposition from fans and politicians, the Premier League still faces financial pressures.</p> <p>The FT reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80c79e49-3f9b-4ca9-866c-9f39f38683c1\">this week</a> that telecoms group BT is seeking to sell its sports broadcasting arm. That would, in effect, remove one of the Premier League's biggest TV partners from bidding for matches in future auctions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Less competition between broadcasters means the value of the Premier League's media contracts may fall in future. After two decades of near continuous revenue growth, all 20 top tier English clubs appear to be facing more straightened times.</p> <p><em>Read the FT analysis on BT's departure from sports broadcasting </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6d30613-af0f-4720-b1bb-c8941bca10c0\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>UFC gives Ari Emanuel knockout win in $10bn Endeavor IPO</h1> <p>UFC, the ultra-violent mixed martials arts tournament, has resurrected <strong>Ari Emanuel</strong>'s legacy.&#xa0;</p> <p>Two years ago, the Hollywood super agent suffered the biggest failure of his career as his entertainment conglomerate, <strong>Endeavor</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aadd57c8-e081-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc\">botched</a> an ambitious IPO. Then the pandemic hit, forcing the company to secure a $260m loan to survive.</p> <p>Yet, this week, Endeavor was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85760a69-fa4f-42c6-a2ec-13feac70399c\">welcomed</a> on the public markets at a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d411a14-17c9-449e-a563-f7ffce6adf40\">$10bn valuation</a>, well above the $8bn Emanuel had failed to fetch in 2019.&#xa0;</p> <p>Asked by Scoreboard what was different this time, chair <strong>Patrick Whitesell</strong>, often described as the mild-mannered yin to Emanuel's foul-mouthed yang, answered unequivocally: UFC.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the revived IPO plan, Endeavor is set to buy the remaining stake of the combat sports franchise it did not already own.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The number one lesson we learned from 2019 was that the UFC and it being wholly owned was something investors coveted. That's the biggest change since then,” said Whitesell. “Not only did [the UFC] survive during Covid, it thrived”.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03ccce22-aebf-11e3-aaa6-00144feab7de\">UFC president</a> <strong>Dana White</strong>, a friend of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> who likened the coronavirus to the common cold, was determined to keep bouts going through the deadly pandemic.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Through Emanuel's close ties to Abu Dhabi's <strong>Mubadala</strong> sovereign wealth fund, UFC last summer began hosting fights on a private island in Abu Dhabi, providing entertainment to fans even as other sports had gone dark.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The sport benefited from that exposure and our ability to put on fights safely,” said Whitesell. “If you're in America, it might be tough to understand cricket. But the UFC is pretty relatable everywhere”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Emanuel is the hyper-ambitious power broker who worked his way up from the mailroom at the CAA talent agency in the 1980s to build one of the most powerful companies in Hollywood.&#xa0;</p> <p>As he sought to expand Endeavor's influence through a series of deals, such as buying rival <strong>WME</strong> for $2.4bn and <strong>UFC</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed0fc18-4760-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c\">$4bn</a>, Endeavor was left saddled with debt just as the pandemic would ravage its business, shelving movies and red carpets.&#xa0;</p> <p>UFC was mostly shielded from the wreckage through a long-term licensing deal with <strong>Disney</strong>, which pays the company more than $300m a year to air fights on <strong>ESPN'</strong>s cable channels and streaming service.</p> <p>“There's a boxing or UFC analogy: You gotta bite down on your mouthpiece and start fighting! You have to be willing to take the emotional damage,” Emanuel <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/ari-emanuel-takes-on-the-world\">told the New Yorker</a> last month. “People get exhausted from that beating. I don't know why I don't”.</p> <p><em>Read more on Endeavor's market debut </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85760a69-fa4f-42c6-a2ec-13feac70399c\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>The path opens to legalised sports betting in Japan</h1> <p>At<strong> Tokyo City Keiba</strong>, the Japanese capital's inner-city horseracing track, punters engage in frenetic betting, <em>writes Leo Lewis in Tokyo in a special dispatch for Scoreboard.</em></p> <p>That open enthusiasm for a flutter is a rarity in a nation where just four sports, including horseracing, are legalised for gambling.&#xa0;</p> <p>Betting on football, the second most popular spectator sport in Japan, was partially deregulated recently, but only then within the constraints of a pools-style lottery system that prevents betting on individual matches or specific moments in a game. Baseball, comfortably the most watched sport in Japan, remains off limits.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f650c035-4e87-406d-9b8a-7b298146450f\">FT revealed this week</a> that things may be about to change. In behind-the-scenes discussions, Japanese politicians are looking at allowing “pari-mutuel” betting on football and baseball by 2024. Other officials argued that overstates the likely speed of government action, but only by a couple of years.</p> <p>Japan's heavily conservative hand on gambling has long been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a273dd6-df41-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c\">something of a curiosity</a>. The practice generates about $55bn of turnover every year. The assumption was the size of the country's sports betting market would soar if people could wager on sports they actually cared about.</p> <p>Many of those observers point to the scale of the illicit betting market, in which people use foreign-issued credit cards to wager on sports betting sites that are hosted offshore but fully catered to Japanese customers.</p> <p>For many years, deregulation felt like a pipe dream. But a lot has changed.&#xa0;</p> <p>In 2016, the administration of then prime minister <strong>Shinzo Abe</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08ef281e-2382-11e8-add1-0e8958b189ea\">rammed through</a> the legislation that would allow Japan's first legal casinos to operate.&#xa0;</p> <p>None have even been built yet. But the law change allowed proponents of sports betting to argue that there is no reason to look favourably on casinos, while banning a flutter on baseball.</p> <p>The second big change has been Covid-19, which has mauled the economics of live sport in Japan and given its lobbyists just cause to plead hardship.&#xa0;</p> <p>The real interest here is in the technology companies — <strong>Rakuten</strong>, <strong>Mixi</strong> and <strong>Cyberagent</strong> being the most prominent — that have already developed mobile betting apps that allow wagering on Japan's legal sports and stand ready for a wider deregulation.&#xa0;</p> <p>The road will not be straightforward. There will be strong political opposition. The betting taboo remains deep seated. But the going is good.</p> <p><em>Read the FT scoop on the secret talks to legalising sports gambling in Japan </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f650c035-4e87-406d-9b8a-7b298146450f\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>Indian Premier League</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ed8ffa9-d384-410c-a96a-2a5f32fd4013\">provoked outrage</a> for playing through the country's brutal Covid-19 wave, drawing accusations of “crass” conduct and diverting vital resources from fighting the public health emergency.
