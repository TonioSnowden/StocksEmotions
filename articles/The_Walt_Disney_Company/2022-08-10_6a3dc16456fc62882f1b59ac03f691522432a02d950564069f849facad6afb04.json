  "title": "Disney Reports Earnings Surge, Adds 14.4 Million New Disney+ Users; Entertainment giant's theme parks division took in record revenue as its streaming business beat analysts' expectations",
  "text": "<p>Disney's strong showing in streaming subscriber growth contrasts with rival Netflix Inc., which last month said it lost nearly 1 million accounts in the second quarter, the company's first ever back-to-back quarterly loss of customers.</p><p>Overall for the third quarter, the world's largest entertainment company reported profits of $1.41 billion, or 77 cents a share, up from $918 million, or 50 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased to $21.5 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $20.99 billion on FactSet.</p><p>Sales at the parks, experiences and products division—which includes Disneyland, Walt Disney World and four resorts in Europe and Asia and has historically been Disney's most profitable segment—reached $7.4 billion for the quarter, a record and up 70% from a year earlier. The division posted profits of $2.2 billion for the quarter, up from $356 million a year ago.</p><p>Chief Executive Bob Chapek attributed the company's strong results to the performance at its domestic theme parks, big increases in live-sports viewership and the subscriber growth at its streaming services.</p><p>Of the 14.4 million subscribers added to the service, just 100,000 came from the U.S. and Canada, a sign that the streaming service may be reaching a saturation point in North America. Netflix lost 1.3 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada and only added net new customers in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Both companies' announcements highlight the challenges they face in attracting new customers domestically, where streaming options abound and many households use one or more services. Plus, in an increasingly difficult economic environment, some households are re-thinking spending on in-home entertainment, industry analysts have said.</p><p>Disney shares rose 5% in after-hours trading to $118.</p><p>Over the past year, Mr. Chapek and other top Disney executives have signaled an increased focus on international markets for growing its streaming business. Disney is spending heavily to produce hundreds of local-language television shows in countries such as India, and over the summer, Disney+ launched in 54 new countries and territories, mainly concentrated in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>Pricing for a Disney+ subscription in many of these new markets runs well below the $7.99 a month that American customers pay. Still, Disney+'s average monthly revenue per paid subscriber—a key metric in streaming businesses—stood at $6.27 in North America, compared with $6.29 internationally, excluding Asia's more inexpensive Disney+ Hotstar service.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Disney? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Disney+ Hotstar, the service used by Disney's 58.4 million subscribers in India, produces just $1.20 per month per user. In June, Disney was outbid for streaming rights to air Indian Premier League cricket matches, a major draw for the Hotstar service, which many analysts and former Disney executives predict will result in millions of canceled accounts over the next year.</p><p>Overall, Disney's direct-to-consumer segment, which includes video streaming, lost $1.1 billion in the third quarter, widening from a loss of $293 million a year earlier. Since Disney+ launched in late 2019, the segment has lost more than $7 billion.</p><p>Also Wednesday, Disney gave a launch date of Dec. 8 and outlined pricing information for its previously announced ad-supported tier of Disney+ in the U.S., a new product designed to expand the reach of the company's streaming business.</p><p>The price of the ad-free standalone Disney+ service will rise from its current level of $7.99 a month in the U.S. to $10.99 a month, or $109.99 a year. The new, basic Disney+ service with ads, will cost $7.99 a month.</p><p>The premium Disney streaming bundle, which includes ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu, as well as a version of sports-focused ESPN+ with ads, will remain at its current price of $19.99 a month in the U.S., while a bundle that includes all three services, only with ads on Hulu, will rise in price by $1 a month, to $14.99.</p><p>Sarah Krouse contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Reports Earnings Surge, Adds 14.4 Million New Disney+ Users</p>",
