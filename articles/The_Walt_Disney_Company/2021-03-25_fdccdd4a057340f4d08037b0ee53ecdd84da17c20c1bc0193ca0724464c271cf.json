  "text": "<p>Even asking the question about film lovers' appetite to get back to the movies is a luxury <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dee84d9-46bb-448e-83fd-1eb5dd440167\">Cineworld can barely afford</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ed56fe4-3d27-477f-8330-362eb08a6159\">November's emergency fundraising</a> was meant to keep the company going until the reopening of its theatres this year. It came up short.&#xa0;</p> <p>Before a $213m convertible bond agreed this week, the group was running sufficiently short of funds that even the slightest delay in reopening, or in receiving an already tardy $200m US tax refund, would have put it in breach of liquidity covenants.</p> <p>With cash burn down to $60m a month with cinemas closed, the bond buys the company three to four months. Investors, who must allow an increase in its debt ceiling, have little choice but to acquiesce to more expensive borrowing with a dilutive sting in the tail.</p> <p>In reality, that still leaves Cineworld awaiting its tax refund for the space to see how the recovery in our social lives plays out.</p> <p>It points to “pent-up demand for affordable out-of-home entertainment”. But trading one indoor screen for another may not be the top choice of a nation craving conversations with people outside their immediate family this summer.</p> <p>Cineworld's assumptions that admissions jump right back to 60 per cent of 2019 levels in May, rising to 90 per cent by year end, look a touch rosy even given the success of vaccine rollouts.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a similar story elsewhere: management hopes UK theatres might open earlier than the mooted date, despite government insistence that no dates will move forward; its planning assumes no lockdowns or restrictions to come next winter despite mutterings from the chief medical officer to the contrary.</p> <p>Cinemas don't have to close for case tallies, R numbers and variants to dent confidence among the cinema-going public and the studios that have been sitting on releases for a year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Disney this week pushed back the release of Marvel's Black Widow from May to July. It will be available on the company's streaming platform from the same date. And <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d0db11c-23ec-4acc-a8d7-5cf82ef62ea1\">Cineworld's deal with Warner Bros</a> cut the cinema exclusivity period before a release can go on pay-per-view in both the UK and the US, compared with before the pandemic, raising more questions about the pull of the movie theatre experience in the post-Covid age.</p> <p>In the longer term, if it gets there, Cineworld's management faces a credibility problem of its own making: can a team that has shown private-equity style tendencies in terms of roll-up deals, high leverage and egregious executive pay packets be trusted to bring down debt, especially given the investment still needed in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cadfe02-d995-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482\">ageing Regal theatres it acquired in 2017.</a></p> <p>In the near term, however, its prospects rest on guesswork around an impossible question: how would the nation most like to spend its Saturday night?</p> <p><strong>The telling tension in oil and gas pay</strong></p> <p>You know strategy is getting serious when it reaches the remuneration report.</p> <p>For the first time, Shell and BP do not have measures linked to production growth of hydrocarbons in their executive pay plans.</p> <p>Given the fanfare about energy transition, it is odd that it's taken this long.</p> <p>Shell in its <a href=\"https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/servicepages/downloads/files/shell-annual-report-2020.pdf\">latest annual report</a> said it had removed production volumes as a performance metric for management bonuses. Until now, the chief executive's bonus plan had been at odds with any touting of the company's green credentials (and arguably the target around energy transition in his long-term incentive plan, or LTIP).</p> <p>BP took volume growth out of the strategic targets for its LTIP plan last year. But reserves replacement — which came out of pay back in 2017 — had clung on in the company's key performance indicators. That too <a href=\"https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2020.pdf\">has now been axed</a>.</p> <p>Shareholders might also wonder why it's taken so long to align these measures with talk about “value over volume”.</p> <p>One conclusion is that executive pay plans are far too complicated, and setting precise targets in an industry facing structural changes and existential threats is a fool's game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, at least, the pay plans better reflect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78e20ca1-3f4b-4c1a-be2a-9b0b0a470904\">the strategic headache</a> facing the groups.&#xa0;</p> <p>Run oil and gas assets ever more efficiently to generate funds for the dividends and buy backs demanded by investors, while leaving space to buy yourself growth and relevance for the post-hydrocarbon age. Doesn't make it any easier to do though.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:helen.thomas@ft.com\">helen.thomas@ft.com</a><br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/helentbiz?lang=en\">@helentbiz</a></p><p>Source: Helen Thomas 2021 'Cineworld's struggles over the post-Covid social life' FT.com 25 March.
