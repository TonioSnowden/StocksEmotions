  "text": "<p>There's a cliché in open-world games that I call “the opening vista”. You begin the game in a narrow cave where you learn the basic controls. It's dark and there's not much to see, but once you've learned to jump, crawl and climb, the game leads you out on to a rocky outcrop of a high mountain. You emerge blinking into the light, your character framed by a vast landscape that begs to be explored. The contrast summons a sense of scale, wonder and freedom. </p> <p>I've seen this familiar technique employed from the apocalyptic wastelands of <em>Fallout</em> to the fantasy forests of <em>Skyrim</em>, but when I saw it in <em>Sable</em>, it somehow felt new. Not because the game's world is particularly novel — its setting of desert nomads living amid the ruins of technologically advanced ancestors is a dime-a-dozen in sci-fi — but rather because it is drawn in a thrillingly unique style.</p> <p>“Drawn” is really the word. Playing <em>Sable </em>is like living in a graphic novel by Jean “Moebius” Giraud, the artist who pioneered a surrealistic sci-fi style which bristles with arresting details. From the opening vista we see scrap metal villages and wind-sculpted mesas drawn in fine black lines, their flat textures and minimal shading drawing attention to a pastel colour palette — one of the most artful I've seen in a game — of tawny desert, powder-blue sky and distant mountains a muted lilac.</p> <p>Yet there is more to <em>Sable </em>than its graphics. The game is named after its main character, a girl embarking on a coming-of-age ritual in which she leaves her village to venture into the unknown. In this world, every character wears a mask that symbolises their position in society, be they cartographer, machinist or merchant. As Sable you complete quests to earn these masks and, while you can swap between them, in the end you must choose one in order to return home. It is not a game about discovering who you are, as if blowing the dust away from a future already written, but rather about experimenting, growing and deciding who you want to be.</p> <p>The fable-like qualities of the narrative are lent depth by Meg Jayanth, the writer behind the superb <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf9973e9-e8b2-42fe-8fdf-c6373ed49471\">interactive novel <em>80 Days</em></a>. Language here bears the plain-spoken profundity of myth. A machinist asking you to repair a malfunctioning wind tower says: “Go there, mend what is broken or soothe what is hurt, and I will give you what you seek . . . a direction.” This abstraction is undercut by precise character writing, particularly in Sable herself, who is far from a blank slate — she is anxious, spunky and entirely relatable. Conversations with other nomads offer spare but evocative fragments to explain the history of the world, allowing players to fill in the gaps themselves.</p> <p>The landscape is inspired by the arid planet Jakku in 2015's <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>, and it feels vast partly because of its emptiness, which Sable navigates either on her sentient hoverbike Simoon or by gliding peacefully across the desert, encased in a scarlet sphere of energy with a saffron sheen.</p> <p>There is much to love about <em>Sable</em>, but it is not without flaws. In a game that eschews combat or complex gameplay, reducing your actions to running, jumping and climbing, those few “verbs” should <em>feel </em>wonderful, and the reality is quite the opposite. Moving Sable around her beautiful world feels clumsy and unintuitive, as unresponsive controls and regular graphical glitches compromise immersion. I want to feel part of this landscape rather than juddering around or eerily floating above it.</p> <p>Furthermore, this is a game that ostensibly encourages players to explore for themselves by tracing landmarks across the horizon, so why are there so many monotonous fetch quests telling me to go over there and collect three beetle shells? It is impossible not to compare the game with the tighter narrative design of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91c60d90-2319-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\"><em>Outer Wilds</em></a> or the superior movement in <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, an obvious touchstone. For a game dreamt up by two guys in a shed in north London, <em>Sable</em> has impressive scope, but it's hard to argue that it feels finished in its current state.</p> <p>Yet I still found myself charmed. Just as Sable chooses her path deliberately, I admire this game for everything it chooses <em>not </em>to be: quiet not loud, exploratory not didactic, thoughtful not violent. Sable is not a hero, she is just a girl trying to find her place in the world — and what a welcoming world it is, a soothing landscape of great beauty where nothing can ever hurt you. I keep returning to get lost among its mountains and watch the sunrise. </p><p>Source: Tom Faber 2021 'The unfettered wonder of open-world games ' FT.com 12 October.
