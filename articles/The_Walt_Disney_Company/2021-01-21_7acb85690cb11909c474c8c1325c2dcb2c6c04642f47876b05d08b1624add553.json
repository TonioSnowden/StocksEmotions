  "title": "Entertainment: Country Gains in Music Streaming --- Morgan Wallen's chart topping album signals a shift for the genre",
  "text": "<p>\"Dangerous\" broke the record for the most streams by a country album in a week, powered by its 240 million U.S. streams in the week ended Jan. 14. That more than doubled the prior record, 102 million streams, achieved by Luke Combs last October. In its debut week, \"Dangerous\" also sold 74,000 U.S. copies as a full package, bringing its total to the equivalent of 265,000 in sales, according to MRC Data, formerly Nielsen Music.</p><p>\"Dangerous,\" which was released on Jan. 8 on Big Loud Records and Republic Records, is considered a bid for superstardom by Mr. Wallen, whose rapid rise has captured the attention of music-industry watchers. Billboard magazine, the music trade publication, put Mr. Wallen on its cover this month. The New Yorker magazine called him \"the most wanted man in country.\" Mr. Wallen also made headlines when \"Saturday Night Live\" dis-invited him as musical guest, after he broke Covid protocols, before inviting him back in December.</p><p>\"The guy seems capable of becoming Garth Brooks for a new generation,\" Chris DeVille, senior news editor at music website Stereogum, wrote this month.</p><p>Mr. Wallen's popularity is a big moment for country music, which historically has lagged behind hip-hop, rock and pop on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Increasingly, more country stars are succeeding thanks in part to streaming, with Sam Hunt, Luke Combs and Gabby Barrett joining streaming success stories like Florida Georgia Line.</p><p>The success of Mr. Wallen, 27, is fueled in part by a long-standing trend in country music: A sound that evokes classic arena and country rock from the 1970s -- like, say, the Eagles or Bruce Springsteen -- but with a Southern accent, and sometimes a hip-hop beat.</p><p>Mr. Wallen, who entered the spotlight via the TV singing contest \"The Voice\" in 2014, didn't initially consider himself a country artist. He embraced the genre because of his drawl and small-town background, according to his own accounts. It worked: Mr. Wallen's debut album, 2018's \"If I Know Me,\" had multiple country hits. The follow-up, \"Dangerous,\" is mainstream country, yet was produced by Joey Moi, who is known for his work with the radio-friendly rock band Nickelback.</p><p>A key reason for country music's recent streaming surge is the pandemic, which froze the live-music business. From the initial lockdown to early May, country audio streams in the U.S. surged more than 20%, making it -- along with children's music -- an early beneficiary, according to MRC Data. By the end of last year, country saw a roughly 15% spike in streams, compared with pre-pandemic levels, led by artists like Mr. Wallen. That dwarfs the 3% increase across genres overall. Country music remains a laggard -- it's still just 7.5% of all U.S. audio streams -- but that is up from 6.9% before Covid-19, a notable gain for the genre.</p><p>On \"Dangerous,\" Mr. Wallen covers familiar country territory with songs about drinking beer and whisky and small-town life. But he also adopts a hip-hop strategy: Issuing a barrage of content. Instead of the typical 10 to 14 songs, \"Dangerous\" has 30 tracks, which helps Mr. Wallen generate more streams and royalties -- though its perceived bloat has turned off many critics.</p><p>Mr. Wallen wasn't the only chart-busting phenomenon this week. Disney actress Olivia Rodrigo hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, making a splashy debut. The 17-year-old newcomer's single, \"Drivers License,\" broke various streaming-service records, thanks to factors including her celebrity, fans poring over her lyrics, popularity on TikTok, a sound indebted to pop star Lorde and a public sign of support from Taylor Swift. Last week, \"Drivers License\" was the most-streamed song in the U.S., with a hefty 76 million streams.</p>",
