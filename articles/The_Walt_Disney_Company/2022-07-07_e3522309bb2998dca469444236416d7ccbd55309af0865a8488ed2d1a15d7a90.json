  "title": "Sun Valley Reveals a New Billionaire Dress Code; Barry Diller in Day-Glo Dior? The Allen & Co. summit known for behind-the-scenes deals may have entered its look-at-me moment.",
  "text": "<p>Known as the \"summer camp for billionaires,\" the Sun Valley Conference is where tech titans and media muckety-mucks attend seminars, hammer out mergers and, if they can find the time between the deal-cutting, laze with their families in Idaho's Wood River Valley.</p><p>This year's attendees included Disney CEO Bob Chapek alongside the man he replaced, Bob Iger; National Amusements President Shari Redstone, Sen. Cory Booker and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. And (surprise!) almost no one wore a tie, let alone a suit.</p><p>Instead, ho-hum half-zip sweaters remained as common a sight as portfolio-clutching assistants. Outgoing Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg and her fiancé Tom Bernthal arrived in lookalike tapered jeans—his paired with what appeared to be a slender cashmere hoodie. Warner Bros.Discovery CEO David Zaslav held court with reporters on Tuesday afternoon in a blue button-down, mid-washed jeans and a pair of Loro Piana's $1,050 Open Walk shoes, the boring-looking style favored by billionaires everywhere.</p><p>Derek Schiller, president and CEO of the Atlanta Braves, looked very much the suburban dad in a tucked-in golf polo and On's springy sneakers. Those minimalist shoes were prevalent at the confab, as they continue to be the unofficial sneakers of the one percent.</p><p>Peppered in amongst this banal garb were splashes of very unboardroom-like panache, including Mr. Diller's designer button-up. (Mr. Diller is married to fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, so he perhaps has a leg up in the wardrobe department.)</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway billionaire Warren Buffett wore a lime-green lizard-printed shirt that he's been spotted in several times over the years. Outfit repeating may indeed be a secret to financial success. Jason Ballard, CEO of 3D-printed home start-up Icon Build, strolled between events in a lofty cowboy hat, distinguishing himself from the infinite array of corporate dad caps.</p><p>Indeed, not every attendee was dressed like they'd been called into the office from the golf course. A few notables tiptoed into what could only be called \"flexing.\" Mega-producer Brian Grazer wore gingerly ripped jeans with a striking yolk-yellow $650-ish zip-up jacket by Stone Island, the Italian outdoor brand beloved by soccer hooligans and rapper Drake. Venture capitalist Aviv \"Vivi\" Nevo, had on an intricately stitched, roughly $1,600 Moncler puffer jacket from the Italian label's collaboration with Paris-based designer Rick Owens.</p><p>In years past, a luxury logo would have been as rare a sighting as a coupon booklet in Sun Valley. Fleece vests stitched with company crests have long been seminar armor, but since Mark Zuckerberg slid into his first cashmere hoodie, logo-free \"stealth wealth\" athleisure has prevailed in the tech and media worlds.</p><p>Now it would seem that some tech titans and financial wonks are shifting toward clothes that more conspicuously cost a fortune. To be sure, this is a peculiar time to flaunt one's wealth. The conference occurred against a backdrop of rising inflation and a possible recession. On Tuesday, the event's opening day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened with a more than 500-point drop.</p><p>Some executives now, though, have embraced the idea that sharpening one's personal brand is as important as maintaining their company's stock price. (This is, after all, what Mr. Zuckerberg was doing with his hoodie—a look now ubiquitous to the point of banality.)</p><p>Elon Musk is practically his own news network, with fans hanging on his every tweet. And Jack Dorsey, who already stands out in Silicon Valley with his Gandalfian beard and drapey Rick Owens high-fashions, was seated in the front row of the Louis Vuitton show in Paris last month, rubbing elbows with Naomi Campbell.</p><p>In this time of C-Suite celebrity, Sun Valley, an event where deals happen behind the scenes, may have entered its look-at-me moment. After all, it was photos of wild-shirted Mr. Diller and not those of, say, the more chaste Jeffrey Katzenberg, that pinged around social media this week. As one journalist tweeted in reference to Mr. Buffett's comely lizard shirt, \"I truly love Sun Valley arrival fashion more than the Met Gala red carpet.\" Both have no shortage of photographers on hand capturing every outfit—but at Sun Valley, some attendees are better at exploiting their time in front of the camera than others.</p><p>Just don't expect Mr. Zuckerberg to wear Dior anytime soon.</p><p>Sun Valley Reveals a New Billionaire Dress Code</p>",
