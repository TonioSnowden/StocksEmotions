The late actor Stanley DeSantis, who appeared in 'The Aviator,' 'Entourage' and 'Alf,' also managed to operate a massive business producing memorabilia T-shirts, many of which are still coveted today",
  "text": "<p>A few weeks ago on eBay, a circa-1990s Stanley DeSantis-produced shirt for the cartoon \"Speed Racer\" sold for $260. A day later, one of his former company's \"Beavis and Butt-head\" tees fetched $200. Sticker prices can go even higher. Not long ago, Charlie Whitley, 38, co-owner of LNF Shop, a vintage store in Montreal, sold an \"Addams Family\" Stanley DeSantis shirt for $600 Canadian (around US$480). Ryan Haas, 27, a vintage dealer in Boston, recently came across a DeSantis-made \"The Simpsons\" shirt listed at $1,000 at a flea market in Philadelphia. Most famously, in August 2020, a Stanley DeSantis-produced shirt printed front and back with the smirking Genie from \"Aladdin\" fetched $6,000 during an Instagram Live auction where hundreds of viewers on the social media platform watched bidders battle it out for the tee.</p><p>For Mr. Whitley, the appeal is all in the graphics. The tees are \"art…they really are beautiful\" he said. No doubt, certain DeSantis creations are frame-worthy, such as a \"The Wizard of Oz\" tee with Dorothy's shimmering red slippers printed on an epic scale or a whimsical Warhol-inspired design showing primary-colored dinosaurs in rectangular boxes. (Steven Spielberg notably wore that one on the set of \"Jurassic Park\" in 1993.)</p><p>Jacob Foster, 21, a student and vintage dealer from Minneapolis, was introduced to DeSantis tees through his parents, who were a bit ahead of the curve when it came to appreciating Desantis's pop-art flair. DeSantis shirts \"appeal to people's emotions,\" said Mr. Foster. The shirts have a nostalgic appeal that slices across generations. Mr. Foster covets DeSantis shirts for properties like \"Aladdin\" and \"Toy Story\" which trigger his childhood memories, while his parents feel warm and fuzzy seeing a tee for cult '90s movies like \"The Mask.\"</p><p>In a move that turned out to be key to his shirts' collectability in the internet age, DeSantis attached his own name to them. It wasn't just a \"Simpsons\" shirt, it was a \"Simpsons by Stanley DeSantis.\" Today, collectors of movie and TV memorabilia (an ever-growing niche market) can plug \"Stanley DeSantis\" into eBay or Instagram and tees of his design pour forth.</p><p>According to his sisters Madeline Ronne and Loretta Kartch, who live in respectively Mishawaka, In. and Frankfort, Ill., these designs were always flowing out of DeSantis's head. Ms. Kartch recalled how after his death, she found a notebook next to his bed brimming with ideas for new shirts that would never come to fruition. The youngest of four, DeSantis was born in 1953 on Long Island, N.Y., and was raised outside Chicago. He took to acting in grade school, and attended New York University's drama school. But he also loved drawing, said Ms. Ronne. In the mid-1970s, he began shilling hand-drawn t-shirts on the city sidewalks between classes. (These tees appear to be lost to time.)</p><p>When he moved to California to pursue acting, he turned his T-shirt side hustle into a professional enterprise. Most budding actors who dream of seeing their name on the big-screen flame out; DeSantis's tees were his safety net—a reliable business that could generate income between infrequent acting gigs. As it turned out, DeSantis found success in both worlds.</p><p>The sisters stressed that, although acting was his true passion, the T-shirts are what brought him his fortune. In a Los Angeles Times article from 1994, Mr. DeSantis claimed that the company grossed $18 million the previous year. Ms. Kartch believed that at one point he employed as many as 40 people. A 1987 Chicago Tribune article noted that DeSantis's cotton T-shirts sold for $13, his sweatshirts for $25. In that pre-internet age, prospective customers had to call or write a letter to Stanley DeSantis Inc. in Los Angeles to place an order.</p><p>One of DeSantis's first mass-manufactured shirts read \"Surrender Dorothy,\" the phrase the Wicked Witch of the West draws in the sky in 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Other early tees relied on similar text-based gags. One that's particularly coveted today reads \"But what I really want to do is direct,\" an industry in-joke poking fun at actors who'd rather take charge behind the scenes. \"He had an unbelievable sense of humor,\" said Ms. Kartch. The tag of each shirt drolly specified: \"Machine wash and tumble dry low clean your room don't stay out past 11:00 without calling.\"</p><p>Though his early shirts trafficked in jokes that avoided copywritten material, as the business grew, DeSantis started to pick up lucrative licensing deals with studios like Disney, MGM and Warner Bros. He diligently stayed abreast of whatever was happening in pop culture. Once, Ms. Kartch recalled, when he was visiting the family in Chicago, he bought issues of 16 Magazine, a teen-girl favorite. \"I said 'what are you buying those for' and he said 'I have to look at them to see what's popular, what's trending.'\"</p><p>Both sisters remember how in the '90s, he called them to ask about the foul-mouthed heroes of the MTV cartoon \"Beavis &amp; Butt-Head\" and the steamy teen soap \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" as if taking the pulse of trusted advisers outside the Hollywood bubble. DeSantis ended up making shirts referencing both shows, which became hot sellers, particularly his take on \"Beavis &amp; Butt-Head.\" In a 1993 Los Angeles Times article, DeSantis projected that he would sell up to $12 million worth of \"Beavis &amp; Butt-Head\" tees during that year's holiday sales rush alone.</p><p>When contacted by the Journal, his sisters, who pay little attention to such things, were shocked to hear of their brother's shirts' recent desirability. When DeSantis died in 2005 and they went to clean up his house, they donated \"boxes and boxes\" of his shirts. Said Ms. Kartch, \"if we would've seen into the future, we would've held onto them.\"</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>MORE IN STYLE &amp; FASHION</p><p>* Banana Republic Tries to Become Cool Again—By Looking to Its Past Sept. 7, 2021</p><p>* How Tight Is Too Tight?
