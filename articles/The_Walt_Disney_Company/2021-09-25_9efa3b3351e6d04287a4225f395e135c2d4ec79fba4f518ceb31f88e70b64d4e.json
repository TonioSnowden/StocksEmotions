  "text": "<p>DNA reveals your identity and ancestry, along with unlocking predictions about what diseases you are likely to develop. Whether your DNA sample is stolen from a discarded water bottle or you give your sample to a direct-to-consumer genetic test, you're handing over a highly personal glimpse into your future health -- valuable intelligence that insurers and blackmailers would love to get their hands on.</p><p>This isn't a theoretical concern. In a legal case that's received plenty of media attention, Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter and his wife allege they had their DNA stolen and tested in a dispute with a neighbor in Palm Beach, Fla. According to the Perlmutters, their DNA was collected without their consent from water bottles and materials they'd touched during a deposition in a lawyer's office. You don't need to take sides in that case to understand the implications of allowing people to swipe medical secrets from potential legal adversaries. Personal genetic information is the next privacy frontier.</p><p>While the Perlmutters' case may be extreme, another scenario involves the genetic information that certain insurance providers can find and use. Federal law currently bars health insurers from accessing genetic testing results, other than what is included in a person's medical history, when assessing rates or coverage, but this law doesn't apply to life insurance, disability or long-term-care companies. That loophole is why in June 2020 Florida became the first state to enact a DNA privacy law that prohibits life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from asking for or obtaining your private genetic information. Floridians don't have to worry about rate hikes or cancellations because their insurers unfairly gained access to their DNA.</p><p>Florida took privacy protection for DNA a step further this year with the Protecting DNA Privacy Act, introduced by Rep. Josie Tomkow. The law, recently signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, creates new crimes prohibiting a person from willfully, and without express consent, collecting or retaining another person's DNA sample, submitting another person's DNA sample for analysis, or disclosing, selling or transferring another person's DNA analysis results to a third party.</p><p>As curiosity about ancestry and genetic makeup continues to grow, instances of insurers misusing a person's DNA will increase. And as much as having your DNA stolen for blackmail might sound like a scene out of your favorite thriller, it really could happen and could be costly to fight.</p><p>Strong DNA protections are needed across the nation now to safeguard people's information from being used against them. The knowledge gained from DNA analysis will undoubtedly unlock unimaginable wonders in the future; let's create the needed protections so that we can take full advantage of the benefits of this technology without the worry of theft, scandal and misuse.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Sprowls, a Republican, is the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.</p>",
