  "title": "Disney stock falls as Disney+ growth slows down even more than expected",
  "text": "<p>Disney&#xa0;DIS reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $159 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. After adjusting for restructuring costs, amortization and other effects, the company reported earnings of 37 cents a share, compared with an adjusted loss of 20 cents a share a year ago.</p><p>Revenue improved to $18.53 billion from $14.71 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 52 cents a share on revenue of $18.8 billion.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the results, analysts keyed on the growth of Disney's streaming efforts. Disney+ added only 2.1 million subscribers in the quarter, a 1.8% increase to 118.1 million after Chief Executive Bob Chapek warned in September of low single-digit growth. Analysts on average expected 125.3 million subscribers at the end of the quarter, according to FactSet.</p><p>Shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trading Wednesday following the release of the results, after declining 0.3% to $174.53 in the regular session.</p><p>“As we celebrate the two-year anniversary of Disney+, we're extremely pleased with the success of our streaming business, with 179 million total subscriptions across our DTC portfolio at the end of fiscal 2021 and 60% subscriber growth year-over-year for Disney+,” Chapek said in a statement announcing the results. “We continue to manage our DTC business for the long-term, and are confident that our high-quality entertainment and expansion into additional markets worldwide will enable us to further grow our streaming platforms globally.”</p><p>Disney breaks down its operations into two segments, “Media and Entertainment Distribution” and “Parks, Experiences and Products.” In the fourth quarter, the media business collected revenue of $13.08 billion in total, while analysts on average expected $13.4 billion.</p><p>The streaming segment, which also includes international products, hauled in $4.56 billion in revenue, roughly in line with analysts' forecasts of $4.58 billion on average. The company's television networks provided sales of $6.7 billion, trailing analysts' average estimate of $6.89 billion, while the film business reported revenue of $2.05 billion vs. expectations of $2.15 billion.</p><p>Disney's theme parks and product sales segment reported $5.45 billion in revenue as attractions slowly reopened in the U.S. and abroad, a spike from $2.7 billion a year ago. The average analyst estimate was $5.45 billion.</p><p>Disney stock has struggled so far this year, falling 3.9% as the S&amp;P 500 index SPX gained 26.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — which counts Disney as a component — has increased 18.7%.</p>",
