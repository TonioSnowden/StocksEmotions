  "text": "<p>Imagination Technologies has reignited its UK rivalry with Arm Holdings in the market for computing chips, with plans to exploit an alternative architecture making headway since Arm's planned sale to Nvidia<em><strong>. </strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>As Nic Fildes reports in this #techFT exclusive</strong></em>, the Hertfordshire-based chip designer has now completed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1797d33e-d3d2-4784-851b-a5df257e2415\">strategic review</a>, launched last year after the UK government intervened to stop Imagination's plan to install four directors linked to Chinese state-controlled fund China Reform Holdings.</p> <p>Simon Beresford-Wylie, the former Nokia executive who now leads the company, argues the semiconductor market has been shaken by Nvidia's move, which still needs regulatory approval, with Arm's neutrality as a supplier of designs to the industry seen as under threat.</p> <p>Arm launched Armv9, its first new architecture in a decade, in March and said it would underpin the next 300bn chips bearing its designs. But the Nvidia sale has also triggered more interest in the Risc-V open architecture. “The momentum is behind it. There is a strong customer pull for it because of the strong Arm position. They are desperate to have an alternative to Arm,” said Beresford-Wylie. </p> <p>Imagination expects to invest up to $150m over the next two years to target a fresh push into the processor design market. The now profitable company, based in the old Ovaltine factory in Kings Langley, had $60m in cash at the end of 2020, having grown its revenue over the year by 44 per cent to $125m. </p> <p>It attempted to crack the CPU market once before when it acquired US chip designer MIPS in 2013, but the move proved unsuccessful and the unit was sold in 2017 when US fund Canyon Bridge took control.</p> <p>The emergence of Risc-V has reopened the door for companies to compete in the CPU market. Imagination is aiming at the automotive and audiovisual markets this year, aiming to generate royalties over a five-to-ten year horizon. “I haven't seen growth potential like this since Nokia in the 1990s,” said Beresford-Wylie. </p> <h1>The Internet of (Five) Things</h1> <p><strong>1. WarnerMedia/Discovery streaming merger</strong> <br>AT&amp;T has agreed to spin off and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a424c8ae-c879-455c-8b57-fcf0605f03af\">combine WarnerMedia with its rival Discovery</a> to compete with Disney and Netflix in the global streaming race. The move will create the second largest media company in the world by revenue after Disney and will have an enterprise value of about $132bn, including $56bn in debt. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2409472e-6e3c-494d-aa7c-f7ee78f97a93\">Lex says</a> AT&amp;T's two big media acquisitions — Time Warner in 2018 for $109bn and DirecTV in 2014 for $67bn — have proved to be millstones for the telco.</p> <p><strong>2. Gojek and Tokopedia in $18bn combo</strong><br>Gojek and Tokopedia, Indonesia's two biggest start-ups, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce944c28-a6d1-42b9-9da2-12e90cb2ae19\">agreed to a merger </a>that will create an $18bn food delivery, ride-hailing and ecommerce group with reach across south-east Asia. The merged company, which will be renamed GoTo, will begin preparing for a dual listing in Indonesia and the US later this year. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48fe3566-f686-4a0e-9cb2-1ce287cad7ac\">Lex says</a> getting closer in size to competitors Grab and Sea is key to staying in the game.</p> <p><strong>3. Gates denies departure linked to probe</strong><br>Bill Gates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ce4b9ab-1918-49d5-85ea-f45cf7c7535e\">has denied</a> that Microsoft's investigation into an “intimate relationship” with an employee had any impact on his decision to leave the software company's board last year. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” a spokesperson for Gates said in a statement. “Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.”</p> <p><strong>4. Cyber attack insurer suffers ransomware hack</strong><br>Insurance group Axa said one of its Asian business units had been the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4443da60-6d90-4d27-b300-b0896425f99f\">victim of a “targeted ransomware attack”,</a> after a group of cyber criminals claimed to have seized troves of sensitive data from the company.
