  "title": "'Kate' and 'Two Jews, Talking' Reviews: A Comedienne and Two Old Guys Walk Into a Theater... Actor Kate Berlant's stage memoir showcases her shapeshifting abilities and contemporary comedic skills, while Ed. Weinberger's pair of new one-act sketches starring Hal Linden and Bernie Kopell is a pleasurable blast from the past.",
  "text": "<p>Like many comedians, Ms. Berlant can channel any number of different voices, delivering relatable everyperson's reflections in a conversational tone, or putting on a thickly humorous Irish brogue to impersonate her mother (non-Irish, but if you've got a good brogue, you've gotta use it, no?), or pouring on a sultry, husky, cigarettes-and-whiskey drawl when she's portraying a woman she met in a jazz bar.</p><p>But Ms. Berlant's gifts don't stop at her voice box. She can also shape-shift if needed, opening and closing the show as a shuffling fellow sliding a broom across the stage (perhaps a homage to Carol Burnett's famous charwoman?), and even breaking out into an ecstatic dance.</p><p>Kate</p><p>Connelly Theater, 220 E. 4th St., New York, $47-$175, 646-450-5453, closes Oct. 8</p><p>And I'm not sure I've ever seen a comic actor with such a manically malleable face. Ms. Berlant's show includes live black-and-white video that is projected on a large screen behind her, and in a particularly delightful passage we see her twisting her features into almost cartoon-like contortions when she's auditioning for a role.</p><p>To sum up, Ms. Berlant has a full panoply of gifts to draw on, but without good material, any comedian is at risk of stage death. Fortunately, \"Kate,\" written by Ms. Berlant and directed by Bo Burnham—also a noted comic, and the writer-director of the movie \"Eighth Grade\"—is a sharp, offbeat and occasionally even heart-stirring selection of scenes from Ms. Berlant's life and career.</p><p>We learn that she spent her youth far from the showbiz mecca she dreams of, Hollywood—in \"a small seaport town called Santa Monica.\" But proximity to the epicenter of movie and television production hardly guarantees success, and Ms. Berlant voyages to New York in her odyssey to establish a career—and escape negative thoughts of the dark secret she reveals. (Spoiler: not so dark.) The aforementioned audition scene is particularly funny, as Ms. Berlant desperately attempts to shed a tear on cue, her nagging inability to do so being a running gag with a moist payoff.</p><p>The show leans in to meta-theatrical conceits, as when Ms. Berlant stops it due to purported technical difficulties, and, toward the end of the roughly 75-minute evening, urges her tech team to shuffle through various bits, skipping toward the finale as time runs out. What does it all matter anyway? She fake foot-stomps when informed that \"Steve from Disney Plus\" is, unexpectedly, not in the audience.</p><p>That finale, by the way, illustrates another of Ms. Berlant's gifts, an ability to subtly blend real emotion with genial mockery. She pokes fun at the marginalization of the theater in today's culture. \"This feels like walking into a bookstore,\" she cracks, and later gripes, \"Sondheim is dead and we have Harry Potter on Broadway.\" But a few moments later she tacks in the opposite direction, returning to a theme invoked at the top of the show, acknowledging that in some ways the communal experience of live theater can be vital, and \"a night of theater can change your life.\" While \"Kate\" may not change anyone's life—except possibly by enhancing Ms. Berlant's already promising career—it certainly provides an evening of virtually unalloyed pleasure.</p><p>***</p><p>If \"Kate\" represents contemporary comedy at its most fresh and sophisticated, \"Two Jews, Talking,\" written by the veteran TV comedy writer Ed. Weinberger and performed by Hal Linden and Bernie Kopell, feels positively if mostly pleasurably antique.</p><p>Two Jews, Talking</p><p>Theatre at St. Clement's, 423 W. 46th St., New York, $79.50-$119, 212-239-6200</p><p>A slight pair of one-acts, the show opens with a sketch set in 1505 B.C., with Mr. Linden and Mr. Kopell playing a pair of weary Jews wandering in the desert after the flight from Egypt. Between the sore feet and the utter lack of any idea where they are, what's not to kvetch about? Mr. Linden's Lou does most of the moaning, cracking of Moses, \"Not once in 30 years has he stopped and asked for directions!,\" while Mr. Kopell's Bud looks on the moderately brighter side. Desert-wandering beats slavery, after all.</p><p>Fast-forward a few millenniums, and Mr. Linden is Marty, who meets Mr. Kopell's Phil when they share a bench in what turns out to be a cemetery. The talk meanders: Mr. Weinberger sometimes seems to be pulling out all the trunk jokes unused over his more than 50-year career. This is humor redolent of the Borscht Belt, with gags about ailments and bodily functions appearing regularly, a gloomy they'll-blame-the-Jews prediction of a Jewish dystopia (\"Then, one by one, they'll start closing the Chinese restaurants!\"), but matters biblical and theological echo themes from the first play.</p><p>\"Two Jews, Talking\" will not set the comedy world afire, but Mr. Weinberger supplies a reliable stream of well-crafted jokes, and Mr. Linden (best-known as the star of the sitcom \"Barney Miller\") and Mr. Kopell (Doc on \"The Love Boat\") make for a smoothly integrated comedy team under Dan Wackerman's attentive direction. As with Ms. Berlant's show, there is ample pleasure simply in watching comic actors displaying their talents, particularly impressive here given that the performers' combined age is roughly—well, not so young.</p><p>'Kate' and 'Two Jews, Talking' Reviews: A Comedienne and Two Old Guys Walk Into a Theater...</p>",
