  "text": "<p>A sombre orchestral version of Nirvana's “Smells Like Teen Spirit” scores the credits of <em>Black Widow</em>, the new Marvel blockbuster. “Here we are now/Entertain us” make fitting lyrics for a film long mothballed by Covid, whose release now speaks to a world of reopened cinemas. (Best not to dwell on the lines that follow: “I feel stupid/And contagious”.) Over the next two hours, the showcase for Scarlett Johansson as lone Avenger Natasha Romanoff works hard to provide just that entertainment. Action scenes have a <em>Bourne</em>-ish wham-bam. Comic asides land neatly. It also bumps into some of the complexities that arise when superhero movies try to join the real world.&#xa0;</p> <p>More of that later. For now we open in 1995 with a tale of two sisters in suburban Ohio. One is Romanoff, the other her younger sibling Yelena. The scene is an origin story, childhood suddenly over with the arrival of US law enforcement. The whole family proves to be a Russian sleeper cell — their parents (David Harbour and Rachel Weisz) mere Soviet handlers.&#xa0;</p> <p>For the record, all of this takes place four years after the dissolution of the USSR. But then part of the appeal of the Marvel movies has always been their own gleaming timeline, so much bigger and cleaner-edged than actual history. The rest of the film unfolds in 2016, a year defined here by the bust-ups of <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. Still, <em>Black Widow</em> is sparing enough with the small print that it might almost be its own movie, a defector from the franchise.</p> <p>With the Avengers asunder, Natasha lives quietly in Norway, rewatching old Bond films. She can quote <em>Moonraker</em> verbatim. The knowing wink is well delivered. Comedy in <em>Avengers</em> movies often has a rictus quality, every casual one-liner clearly the product of multiple writers working in shifts. Here the touch is lighter, defter.&#xa0;</p> <p>The spectacle feels different too. Soon the story relocates to Budapest, host to a blue-grey mood of espionage. Then comes a reunion with the adult Yelena, now played by Florence Pugh. Old grudges are aired. If the hallmark of Marvel is the pumped-up grandeur of software and greenscreens, director Cate Shortland stages an acrobatic but deeply human fight scene between Pugh, Johansson and their body doubles. The sequence is a brilliantly stylish bit of filmmaking that will also ring bells for anyone who has ever seen two primary-school-age siblings having at it on the kitchen floor.</p> <p>The pair will find a common foe. The movie proceeds as a vehicle for Johansson and Pugh's audition as future Marvel star. She passes, equal parts bone-cruncher and joker. Just as droll is Harbour, reappearing as a Marxist relic scorned by the Kremlin. Paunchy and bedraggled, he relives his past as Red Guardian, a forgotten Soviet superhero. The counterfactual is a blast. Washington won the cold war — the communists get the best gags.</p> <p>Other old faces are anything but clownish —&#xa0;monsters who have terrorised girls for generations. If the movie has giddy fun with geopolitics, its scrutiny of male power is admirable but precarious. The self-awareness of Marvel is one vexed question. (Johansson has publicly complained about her character's sexualisation by the company.) Another is what justice can be done to hideous realities like child trafficking in comic book universes. The tonal weirdness peaks with a joshing exchange about forced sterilisation. Even Pugh struggles to pull that off.&#xa0;</p> <p>By the end, normal service resumes. The last act is given over to the usual CGI malarkey. There are frictionless tributes to choice and family. <em>Black Widow</em> makes a refreshing change in all sorts of ways but stay for the closing credits and you even see the loose threads of the story prepped as a saga to come. As Red Guardian would say, in capitalist America there is always a sequel.&#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas from today and on Disney Plus from July 9</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh are superhero sisters in Black Widow' FT.com 7 July.
