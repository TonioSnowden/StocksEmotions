  "text": "<p>Also Saturday, a statement from John J. Ray, the company's new CEO, struck a slightly more optimistic tone about the possibility of recovering assets to repay those creditors. On Thursday, the veteran bankruptcy executive said he'd never seen anything as bad  as FTX in 40 years in the restructuring business.</p><p>\"We are pleased to learn that many regulated or licensed subsidiaries of FTX, within and outside of the United States, have solvent balance sheets, responsible management and valuable franchises,\" said Ray, who was hired to oversee the company during its bankruptcy process, on Saturday.</p><p>FTX's new management  hired an investment bank to help sell viable parts of its business and discovered there were more than 200 accounts containing positive cash balances. A separate filing in federal bankruptcy court identified 216 bank accounts with positive balances, offering the possibility that there was some value left in FTX's wreckage for creditors to recover. It verified account balances worth about $564 million, according to the filing. Much of that money, however, is either held in outside entities that directly filed for bankruptcy protection or is considered restricted cash, meaning others may lay claim to it.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com. </p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>The new office status symbol holds a lot of water â€” and has a wait list. </p><p>Disney parks' ride stoppages and wait times grow as ticket prices rise. </p><p>FTX owes $3.1 billion to its 50 largest creditors</p>",
