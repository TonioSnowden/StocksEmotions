  "text": "<p>As a result of the agreement, Frndly TV will offer 30 live TV channels, adding to its current bundle that already includes the Hallmark Channel and the Weather Channel. The company said it would raise the basic monthly subscription price to $6.99 from $5.99. Frndly TV's other subscription tiers will also increase.</p><p>Frndly TV launched, as many so-called skinny bundles -- TV-over-internet services designed to lure cord-cutters with smaller lineups of channels for a significantly lower price than cable TV -- kept increasing the range of their programming and price. At some point, there was hardly a difference between skinny bundles and a traditional pay-TV package.</p><p>\"The whole concept of affordability was starting to get lost,\" said Andy Karofsky, Frndly TV's chief operating officer and one of its co-founders. He said that they -- including Mike McClain, Bassil El-Khatib and Michael McKenna -- felt there were plenty of family-focused channels on cable that had a massive audience and could be packaged into a no-frills skinny bundle.</p><p>The two most popular internet-TV bundles in the U.S. -- Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube TV and Walt Disney Co.-controlled Hulu + Live TV -- have more than 75 channels and cost $65 a month. Philo, which like Frndly TV focuses on lifestyle and family-friendly content and eschews sports networks, offers over 60 channels for $25 a month.</p><p>The absence of sports, news and major entertainment networks, like WarnerMedia's TBS or NBCUniversal's USA Network, allows Frndly TV to keep its subscription price down, Mr. Karofsky said. \"What Frndly TV delivers is very focused -- it's not trying to be all things for all people,\" said Paul Erickson, a senior analyst at Parks Associates, a research firm.</p><p>Frndly TV said it had more than 500,000 subscribers as of October and reached profitability in the second year. Frndly TV's subscriber base is much smaller than that of YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, each with about 3.7 million subscribers as of the second quarter of 2021, according to MoffettNathanson, a research firm.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
