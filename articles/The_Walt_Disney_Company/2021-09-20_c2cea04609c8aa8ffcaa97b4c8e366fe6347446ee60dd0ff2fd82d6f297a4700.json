  "title": "SEC Is Investigating Activision Blizzard Over Workplace Practices, Disclosures; Company is also in talks to settle a probe conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission",
  "text": "<p>The agency is asking for documents including minutes from Activision board meetings since 2019, personnel files of six former employees, and separation agreements the company has reached this year with staffers, records show. The SEC is asking for Mr. Kotick's communications with other senior executives regarding complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination by Activision employees or contractors, the documents show.</p><p>An Activision spokeswoman, Helaine Klasky, on Monday confirmed that the SEC's investigation concerns \"the company's disclosures regarding employment matters and related issues,\" adding that the agency has subpoenaed several current and former employees. \"The company is cooperating with the SEC,\" the spokeswoman said.</p><p>An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>The probe by the SEC significantly ratchets up the regulatory pressure on Activision, the largest U.S. videogame publisher by market capitalization. The SEC is requesting information to discern whether Activision and its executives properly disclosed allegations of workplace harassment and gender-pay issues, and whether any of that information should have been shared earlier with investors and other parties, according to the documents and people familiar with the investigation.</p><p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Activision in late July, alleging the company paid women less than their male counterparts and provided them with fewer opportunities to advance. The agency also alleged that Activision ignored complaints by female employees of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation and maintained a \"frat-boy\" culture, primarily at its Blizzard Entertainment unit.</p><p>Activision has said it would fight the charges from the California agency. It initially slammed the lawsuit, saying it included distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of its past. Employees responded by planning walkouts, and Mr. Kotick said that Activision's initial response was \"tone deaf\" and that the company had hired a law firm to investigate the complaints.</p><p>Separately, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been examining allegations of gender-based harassment at Activision since at least May 2020, according to people familiar with the investigation and documents viewed by the Journal.</p><p>The company is in settlement talks with the agency and could pay millions of dollars to resolve the matter, according to those people. It's unclear if the federal agency will publicly release the details of its findings.</p><p>An EEOC spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Ms. Klasky of Activision said in a statement that Activision is deeply committed to making the company one of the best, most inclusive places to work.</p><p>\"We have made and are making a number of important changes to improve our policies and procedures to ensure that there is no place anywhere in our company for discrimination, harassment or unequal treatment of any kind,\" the statement said.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Communications Workers of America filed charges earlier this month with the National Labor Relations Board against Activision, alleging worker intimidation. The charges include allegations that company management used coercive tactics to prevent its employees from exercising their rights to organize under federal law.</p><p>In a statement Monday, Ms. Klasky of Activision said the company has \"made great efforts to respect the rights of all employees under the NLRB.\"</p><p>The same day that the union filed charges, Activision said it hired two senior executives to help it build a more inclusive workplace and grow its revenue. Julie Hodges, a Walt Disney Co. executive, was named chief people officer and Sandeep Dube, a Delta Air Lines Inc. executive, was named chief commercial officer. Ms. Hodges, who had oversight of compensation, benefits and talent acquisition at Disney, is filling the role of human resources chief being vacated by Claudine Naughton.</p><p>Based in Santa Monica, Calif., Activision had roughly 10,000 employees at the end of last year and posted $8 billion in revenue. Its console, computer and mobile games collectively boast nearly 400 million monthly players across 190 countries.</p><p>While the videogame industry has long been known for its male-dominated workplaces and culture, scrutiny from public authorities over the treatment of female employees has increased in recent years.</p><p>The California regulator last month, in an amended complaint, accused the company of withholding information from internal probes of discrimination and harassment complaints as well as gender pay equity. It also said Activision had sought to curtail employees' rights through \"repressive, if not punitive\" secret settlements.</p><p>An Activision spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the amended complaint.</p><p>Jim Oberman and Ben Fritz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Kirsten Grind at kirsten.grind@wsj.com and Sarah E.
