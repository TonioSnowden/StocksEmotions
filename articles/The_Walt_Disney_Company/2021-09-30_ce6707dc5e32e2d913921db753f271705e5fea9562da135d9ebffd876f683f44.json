  "text": "<p>(Disney+)</p><p>By his count, Bobby Moynihan voices at least five characters in the \"Star Wars\" universe, including a pig-ish creature in \"Star Wars Resistance\" and a five-eyed bartender in the virtual-reality experience, \"Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge.\" In \"Tatooine Rhapsody,\" Mr. Moynihan plays Geezer, who is a Hutt -- as in Jabba the Hutt. Geezer is a bass player in a rock band who is being hunted by villain Boba Fett.</p><p>\"I can't believe I am in a comedy/rock version of 'Star Wars' property and that I'm not terrified that it's going to be awful, because it sounds like a crazy bad idea,\" the former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member said in a phone interview. \"It's extremely hard to do comedy in 'Star Wars' because it's such a fantastical thing already.\"</p><p>\"Tatooine Rhapsody\" is an installment in 'Star Wars: Visions,' a new anthology made up of nine short films in the \"Star Wars\"\" universe created by seven anime studios. All of them are streaming now on Disney+. Other voices in the anthology include Alison Brie, Neil Patrick Harris and Karen Fukuhara.</p><p>Mr. Moynihan says that what he likes about \"Visions\" is that it gives different filmmakers who love \"Star Wars\" a chance to try their hand at it. \"You can't not enjoy watching someone play in a playground they've always wanted to play in,\" he says.</p><p>New Release: 'No One Goes Alone'</p><p>(Amazon, etc.)</p><p>Erik Larson's works of nonfiction are populated with dialogue and minutia that he has meticulously reported to bring characters, events and cities to life. In \"The Devil in the White City,\" for example, he reported that the planners of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago didn't merely smoke during dinner, their banquets had cigarettes and cigars on the menu alongside courses of oysters, asparagus and \"a glass or two of Montrachet.\"</p><p>\"I live for the mundane,\" he said in a phone interview. \"When I'm working on one of my nonfiction books and I come across something that I just know has to be in the book, I just get an almost malignant sense of joy in finding this thing that I'm pretty sure nobody else found, or if they did come across it, they did not feel it rose to the level of something worthy of Churchillian scholarship.\"</p><p>\"No One Goes Alone\" is Mr. Larson's first work of fiction and first audiobook exclusive. It is a ghost story about researchers who go exploring for the supernatural in a home on a remote British island in 1905. Inventing the story, he says, brought its own euphoric moments.</p><p>\"Maybe this is something that novelists have always experienced, and this is what makes it such a fascination for them, but what was really interesting for me was how things just did sort of come to me,\" he says. \"I would be writing and I'd say, this is what just happened. This just happened there. I don't know where this stuff comes from. And that's, frankly, thrilling.\"</p>",
