  "text": "<p>\n  FRANK SHANKWITZ </p><p>\n  1943-2021 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Chris Greicius was near death by the time he met Frank Shankwitz, a motorcycle officer of the Arizona Highway Patrol, in 1980. </p><p>\n  The 7-year-old leukemia patient -- inspired by the TV show \"CHiPs,\" about motorcycle cops -- wanted to be a highway patrolman. Mr. Shankwitz, who was asked to help grant that wish, plopped Chris on a motorcycle and let him switch on the siren. The patrol also thrilled Chris by giving him a badge and a certificate declaring him an honorary officer. Two seamstresses worked overnight to sew a uniform for him. </p><p>\n  Soon afterward, Chris died. After attending his funeral, Mr. Shankwitz joined Chris's mother, Linda Pauling, and several other people in founding what is now the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The charity has chapters world-wide and says it has granted wishes to more than 500,000 children with critical illnesses. </p><p>\n  Mr. Shankwitz died of esophageal cancer Jan. 22 in Prescott, Ariz. He was 77. </p><p>\n  \"Everyone can be a hero,\" he said in a 2019 interview with \"Inside Edition.\" \"You don't need to have money to be a hero. You can just give back -- give back your time.\" </p><p>\n  In his later years, he acknowledged a wish of his own: He wanted his story to be told so his children and grandchildren would know what he had done. His memoir, \"Wish Man,\" was published in 2018. </p><p>\n  Greg S. Reid, an author and motivational speaker who had been touched by Mr. Shankwitz's message, produced a movie version of his life, also called \"Wish Man\" and released in 2019. Mr. Shankwitz was thrilled with the tribute. \"Wish granted,\" said Mr. Reid. </p><p>\n  Frank Earle Shankwitz was born March 8, 1943, in Chicago. His father helped produce the Montgomery Ward catalog. His mother was a waitress. After his parents divorced, he was shuttled between homes in Chicago and Michigan. When he was around 10, his mother moved him to Arizona. </p><p>\n  Before settling down there, he said later, \"we lived in the back of our car, we lived in tents, we lived in flop houses.\" </p><p>\n  While living in a trailer in Seligman, Ariz., he attended junior high school and worked at the Snow Cap drive-in, whose owner, Juan Delgadillo, became his mentor. He attended high school in Prescott, Ariz., where he played football and worked at a Safeway store. </p><p>\n  Unable to afford college, he joined the Air Force in 1961 and was assigned to the security forces at bases in New Mexico, Montana and England. He earned extra money by pressing uniforms and shining boots for other servicemen. </p><p>\n  After completing his Air Force service in 1965, he moved to Phoenix and worked at Motorola Inc., where his jobs included analyzing the failure rate of parts. Bored by that work, he joined the Arizona Highway Patrol in 1972. </p><p>\n  While chasing a drunk driver at around 80 miles an hour in the late 1970s, he was knocked off his motorcycle and suffered a fractured skull. After months of rehabilitation, he taught bicycle safety in schools and volunteered to help organize Special Olympics events. </p><p>\n  His experience in working with children made him a natural choice when the highway patrol was asked to assign patrolmen to spend time with Chris Greicius. Their bond was instant. \"All of a sudden I was his hero,\" Mr. Shankwitz said later, \"and I had never been anybody's hero before.\" </p><p>\n  The second wish he and his colleagues granted involved a visit to Disneyland. Calling from Arizona, Mr. Shankwitz had trouble finding anyone at Disneyland to listen to his request for help. Finally, he called back and pretended he had a warrant for a Disney employee's arrest. That caught the attention of a senior person, who took the call. Mr. Shankwitz admitted he had lied about the warrant. Then he made his plea. Disneyland came through with full cooperation. </p><p>\n  \"Sometimes you have to cheat a little bit,\" Mr. Shankwitz said after telling that story in a speech several years ago. </p><p>\n  As a roving ambassador for volunteer work, Mr. Shankwitz mastered the art of public speaking. </p><p>\n  He is survived by his wife, Kitty Carlisle Shankwitz, along with two daughters, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. An earlier marriage ended in divorce. </p><p>\n  In recent years, Mr. Shankwitz focused on helping other nonprofits, including Broadway Hearts, which arranges entertainment for children in hospitals; Level Up Home, which provides housing and job opportunities for young people, and Wounded Blue, which helps wounded and disabled law-enforcement officers. </p><p>\n  He was a student of World War II history. His wife once granted him another wish by purchasing a ride for him on a vintage warplane. </p><p></p>",
