  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 82 points, or 0.2%, to 32,909.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 2 points, or 0.1%, at 3,809.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP ticked up 14 points, or 0.1%, to 10,579.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow rose 424 points, or 1.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.9%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks were striving to record a three-day winning streak. The S&amp;P 500's 2.3% gain over the previous couple of sessions was partly the result of buyers front-running a traditional \"buy signal\" event, the completion of the U.S. midterm elections, according to some analysts.</p><p>\"U.S. equities began the week bouncing back, with the S&amp;P 500 convincingly up ahead of the U.S. midterm elections on Tuesday, where a divided government in Washington is ostensibly bullish for equities,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>\"The rationale is pretty straightforward. Gridlock cross-checks each party's 'worst impulses', and less activist fiscal policy is conducive to lower market volatility,\" Innes added.</p><p>Crucial to determining that post-election scenario is the Federal Reserve's need to keep tightening monetary policy to combat inflation running near 40-year highs. Consequently, for many investors it is Thursday's consumer prices data and not politics that will determine the market's trajectory going into the end of the year.</p><p>The message from the bond market in that regard is not particularly supportive of stocks. The monetary policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y is holding above 4.7%, near its highest since 2007.</p><p>In addition, despite the S&amp;P 500 having bounced 6.4% from its 2022 closing low in mid October, the bear market downtrend remains intact, warn some analysts.</p><p>\"The [S&amp;P 500's] spike back above 3800 might have seemed positive to many investors after SPX successfully held 3700 last week, but technically last week's deterioration remains a larger technical concern heading into mid-term Elections and CPI data,\" wrote Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.</p><p>\"Downside risk levels are very well defined at 3700, and any break of this level turns the near-term quite bearish which could bring about a quick retest of October lows. Bottom line, market indices remain in a key window of volatility, and it's essential for the Bulls that Technology starts to stabilize quickly along with rates showing more weakness,\" Newton added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the third-quarter U.S. corporate earnings reporting season rumbles on, with Walt Disney Co. DIS the highlight on Tuesday, when it reports after the close of trade.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Lyft Inc. LYFT shares fell 17.4% after ride-hailing company postedmixed third-quarter results Monday afternoon that showed underwhelming customer numbers even as Lyft benefitted from pricing trends.</p><p>* Shares of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. TTWO dropped 15% after the videogame publisher cut its bookings outlook for the year by $400 million because of pipeline \"shifts,\" and weaker-than-expected mobile and in-game spending.</p><p>U.S. stocks attempt 3-day winning streak with midterm elections under way</p>",
