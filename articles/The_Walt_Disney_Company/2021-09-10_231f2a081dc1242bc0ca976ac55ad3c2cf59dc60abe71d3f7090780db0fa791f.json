  "text": "<p>Disney's animated film \"Encanto '' will get a 30-day exclusive theatrical release, starting Nov. 24, before moving onto the Disney+ platform.</p><p>Other releases include \"Eternals,\" \"The Last Duel,\" \"West Side Story,\" \"The King's Man,\" and \"Ron's Gone Wrong,\" and they are slated to run a minimum of 45 days exclusively in theaters.</p><p>\"As confidence in moviegoing continues to improve, we look forward to entertaining audiences in theaters,\" said Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution Chairman Kareem Daniel. The entertainment sector has been hard-hit by pandemic-related restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>Earlier this year, Disney released \"Black Widow\" simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+. During its July 9 opening weekend, the film took in $80 million at the domestic box office and $78 million overseas, and generated another $60 million from $30 at-home purchases on Disney+.</p><p>Weeks after the release, \"Black Widow\" star Scarlett Johansson sued the company, saying the simultaneous release was a breach of contract and had hurt her financially. Disney has disputed those claims.</p><p>Tensions have simmered between actors, producers and directors, and the entertainment industry's gatekeepers over compensation as the pandemic has disrupted the way entertainment is distributed and consumed.</p><p>Write to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Will Release Rest of 2021 Films Exclusively in Theaters</p>",
