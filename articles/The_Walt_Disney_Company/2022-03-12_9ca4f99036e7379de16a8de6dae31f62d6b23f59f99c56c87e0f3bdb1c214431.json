  "title": "U.S. News:  Florida Political Uproar Engulfs Disney  ----  By Erich Schwartzel",
  "text": "<p>   On Monday, Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Chapek said he didn't want to wade into politics. He finished the week pledging to crusade against anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country and in a public fight with the governor of the state that houses his company's most famous asset. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek on Friday took the most drastic step yet in trying to quell anger over Disney's response to a Florida bill known by opponents as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, saying the company was pausing all political giving in the state and boosting efforts to fight similar legislation in other parts of the country. </p><p>   The Florida bill, which prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in certain grade levels at schools, has become a national flashpoint as opponents across the country and Mr. Chapek's own employees called on Disney to speak out against it. The family-entertainment giant became critics' primary target in recent weeks, because it operates Walt Disney World near Orlando and is among the state's most high-profile employers. </p><p>   It was a week of damage control that ended with Mr. Chapek trying to assuage his staff and critics by announcing Disney was re-evaluating all of its political giving and begging his employees' forgiveness. </p><p>   \"You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,\" Mr. Chapek wrote in the Friday letter. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek has been CEO of Disney since February 2020, but he has been on his own as the company's top executive for less than three months, since his predecessor, Robert Iger, stepped down as executive chairman at the end of 2021. This past week offered the sharpest contrast yet between the two men. While Mr. Iger became a celebrity CEO comfortable with bringing progressive politics into the C-suite -- and even toyed with running for president -- Mr. Chapek has eschewed such public positions and rose through the ranks happy to let others have the spotlight, colleagues said. </p><p>   This past week, however, he met a workforce that, like many in the U.S., expects public stances from its leaders. The tension turned Disney into another high-profile example of how national politics have seeped into corporate America -- and a case study in how quickly the public perception of a company can change. </p><p>   On Monday, Mr. Chapek said corporate statements against such legislation were counterproductive, and that his company's inclusive programming was the best tool it had in combating discrimination. When that caused the chorus of critics to grow louder, he spent a significant portion of his annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday backtracking, saying Disney had been opposed to the bill from the start and that he was personally lobbying Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to consider how it might hurt children. </p><p>   Mr. DeSantis, speaking to supporters on Thursday, criticized Disney one day after Mr. Chapek said he had plans to meet with the governor and discuss the legislation. </p><p>   \"The chance that I am going to back down from my commitment to students and back down from my commitment to parents' rights simply because of fraudulent media narratives or pressure from woke corporations? The chances of that are zero,\" said Mr. DeSantis. </p><p>   He attacked Disney by name, saying it was hypocritical for the company to make money on family entertainment and then speak out against a bill designed to protect parents' rights. Mr. DeSantis even cited the company's work in China, arguing that Disney should answer for its business in a country with human-rights abuses. </p><p>   Mr. DeSantis's national profile has risen in part thanks to conservative legislation like the Parental Rights in Education bill, which LGBTQ activists have said will cause harm to children struggling with their sexual and gender identity by cutting off support from teachers and encouraging teachers to out gay students to their parents. The bill's sponsors have defended it as a way of letting families deal with children's issues rather than teachers. </p><p>   Disney's political giving in Florida has included donations to politicians who supported the controversial Parental Rights in Education bill, which passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday. Opponents of the bill cited Disney's political support for those legislators in their campaign against the company. </p><p>   Dana Terrace, the creator of the Disney show \"The Owl House\" said in a video posted on Twitter Monday that she was angry about Disney's backing of sponsors of the Florida bill, and said Mr. Chapek's memo was nothing more than \"flowery and compassionate words to shut you up.\" </p><p></p>",
