  "text": "<p>   More than 15 million people tuned in to watch ABC's coverage of the 94th annual Academy Awards, according to preliminary numbers from TV-ratings firm Nielsen. </p><p>   That is a significant increase from last year's record low of 10.4 million viewers of ABC's broadcast of the ceremony, which was much smaller in scale due to Covid-19 concerns. ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co. </p><p>   Whether Will Smith's slap of Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about Mr. Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, boosted ratings in the last hour of the show won't be known until Nielsen issues its final ratings later this week, which will include quarter-hour breakdowns of viewership. </p><p>   While the audience for Sunday's telecast was a vast improvement from 2021, it is still a big decline from the 23.6 million who tuned in to watch the 2020 Oscars and continues a trend of declining viewership for the award ceremony. </p><p></p>",
