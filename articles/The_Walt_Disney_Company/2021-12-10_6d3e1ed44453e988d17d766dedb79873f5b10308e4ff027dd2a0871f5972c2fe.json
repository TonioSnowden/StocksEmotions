They came to sit quietly in a pew and let themselves be overwhelmed by how much faith it must have taken to build this monument over hundreds of years. If they had wanted to see a Disney laser show, they would have gone to the Louvre Museum. </p><p>   Gerhard Popp </p><p>   Webster, N.Y. </p><p></p>",
