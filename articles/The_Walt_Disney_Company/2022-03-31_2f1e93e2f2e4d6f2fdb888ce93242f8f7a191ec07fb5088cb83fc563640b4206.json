  "text": "<p>(HBO Max)</p><p>It took about 3,000 eggs and 1,000 pounds of butter to whip up the first season of \"Julia,\" HBO Max's new series about Julia Child's transition from a chef and cookbook author to the host of \"The French Chef\" and a pioneering TV personality. Every time a dish was cooked on the series, Sarah Lancashire, who portrays Child and who did her own cooking, had to cook it over and over for each take.</p><p>Daniel Goldfarb, the show's creator, says the goal wasn't to get the recipes just right for the camera. In the first episode, when Child throws together an omelet on a hot plate during a TV appearance, the omelet turns out runny. Mr. Goldfarb said they left in the runny omelet because they wanted to evoke Child's message that entertaining wasn't about perfection, but experience.</p><p>\"Don't get me wrong, the food is gorgeous on the show,\" he says. \"But, we also wanted to make sure that that was part of the story, that we didn't just erase the imperfections from Julia. The imperfections are part of what makes her so beautiful.\"</p><p>The first three episodes of \"Julia\" are streaming now on HBO Max.</p><p>'Moon Knight'</p><p>(Disney+)</p><p>\"Moon Knight,\" the latest Marvel series on Disney+ stars Oscar Isaac as a man with dissociative identity disorder, whose personalities include a soft-spoken gift-shop clerk named Steven Grant and a mercenary named Marc Spector. He is also Moon Knight -- the human embodiment of the Egyptian god Khonshu. His primary adversary is a cult leader named Arthur Harrow, played by Ethan Hawke. Moon Knight stands between Harrow and his plans to heal the world through mass murder.</p><p>\"It's about a hero that kind of takes the shape of the moon,\" Mr. Hawke said in an interview. \"He keeps changing. He doesn't even know his own personality. He doesn't even know if he actually is a superhero, or if he's insane.\"</p><p>\"Moon Knight\"is streaming now on Disney+.</p><p>'The Outlaws'</p><p>(Prime Video)</p><p>\"The Outlaws\" starts as a comedy about a group of strangers who must complete court-mandated community service by sprucing up a dilapidated community center in Bristol, England. It becomes a thriller when one of them stashes a drug dealer's bag of cash in the building, and some of the others find it. Juggling both genres, \"The Outlaws\" explores social-media culture, criminal justice, found family and how a motley group of strangers has the perspectives, skills and life experiences to be there for each other. The ensemble cast includes Eleanor Tomlinson, Clare Perkins and Christopher Walken.</p><p>All six episodes of the first season of \"The Outlaws\" begin streaming Friday on Prime Video.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
