  "title": "'George Hearst' Review: A Head for Metals; At first nobody believed the ore Hearst brought back was worth anything. Turns out it was one of the earliest hauls from the Comstock Lode.",
  "text": "<p>At the summit Hearst found a vein of coal, hacked out a chunk, and set it on fire. The flame sputtered and died in seconds. He tossed the lump aside and went looking for another. He found a different vein, hacked out another piece and ignited it. This one burned steadily for 10 minutes, Clunie recalled, while Hearst watched it \"as a mother does her first-born.\" Hearst scrambled back down the hill and bought the vein. He was 69 years old.</p><p>Stomach cancer would claim Hearst barely a year later, but as Matthew Bernstein demonstrates in \"George Hearst: Silver King of the Gilded Age,\" the old miner went about his work right to the end with the same tenacity, demon energy and genius for finding what he was after that had made him one of the richest men in the American West.</p><p>Hearst was born in 1820 into modest yet comfortable circumstances in Missouri, where his father owned three small farms. Farming interested young George not at all, but when he was 15, lead was discovered near his home. The subsequent diggings fascinated him. \"I think I was naturally a mineralogist,\" he would write years later. \"The knowledge seems to me instinctive.\"</p><p>When gold was discovered in California, Hearst headed west with plenty of competition: There were perhaps 800 San Franciscans before the metal revealed itself at Sutter's Mill. By the time Hearst arrived, in the fall of 1850, the city's population had swelled to 25,000, with more than 100,000 hopefuls scouring the riverbeds.</p><p>Hearst joined them, and after some discouraging months seeking gold along the rivers—which were overcrowded and quickly exhausted—he turned to the mountains. By then he was looking for quartz, not because it was valuable, but because he had learned that during the volcanic birth of California's coastal mountains, streams of molten quartz carried gold along with them and imprisoned it as they cooled.The knowledgeable prospector could crack open a stone and see within its snowy depths a gleaming yellow filling. Hearst's friends gave him the name \"Quartz George.\"</p><p>Then came Washoe, part of Utah Territory at the time. Hearst had heard about silver deposits there, and bought a share of a mine. At first nobody believed that the ore he brought back to San Francisco was valuable, but finally the head of the San Francisco Mint agreed to give it a look—he offered Hearst and his associates $91,000 after costs, or about $3 million today, for what turned out to be one of the earliest extractions from the Comstock Lode. After that, the money never stopped.</p><p>Nor did Hearst. In the following decades he traveled throughout the West, sometimes coming up dry, more often not. Some 65 miles outside of Butte, Mont., in 1883, Hearst began digging at the Anaconda Mine, where \"they struck a bed of pure copper. Continuing to delve, they found that the bed was thirty to forty feet wide and descended more than a thousand feet. In other words,\" Mr. Bernstein writes, \"it was the greatest copper strike on the planet.\"</p><p>An account of all that roaming, all of it following roughly the same routine, could be wearying, but Mr. Bernstein, a professor of English at Los Angeles City College, keeps it sprightly and engaging. Hearst's tireless questing has a fascination to it, and his tale is enlivened by the tangy titles of the places where he made his fortune, names that inspired the poet Stephen Vincent Benét to write, \"I have fallen in love with American names, / The sharp names that never get fat, / The snakeskin-titles of mining-claims, / The plumed war-bonnet of Medicine Hat, / Tucson and Deadwood and Lost Mule Flat.\"</p><p>Hearst did occasionally interrupt his prospecting. On a visit home to Missouri, the 40-year-old prospector fell for an 18-year-old named Phoebe Apperson, and married her in 1862. It was a happy match—he certainly wasn't around enough to get on her nerves—and they produced one child, William Randolph Hearst, who would embed himself in the national memory even more deeply than his father.</p><p>Unlike some of his fellow Western financial titans—the fearsome Collis P. Huntington, for instance—the elder Hearst had a knack for making friends. One of them from the Gold Rush days said that his \"strong common sense inspired confidence and made him a leader of public opinion and of men. He also had a vein of humor which amused and fascinated the learned as well as the illiterate. He was at home in the company of men of all conditions.\"</p><p>Well, not all. He had a rival in Clarence King, a fellow appraiser of mines. Both the Southerner and the Westerner in Hearst disliked what Mr. Bernstein describes as King's \"high-minded northern sensibilities.\" King, for his part, remarked that \"Hearst was bitten on the privates by a scorpion; the latter fell dead.\"</p><p>Perhaps inevitably for a man of his wealth, Hearst went into politics, ending his days as a Democratic senator from California. This is surely the least appealing part of his career. Still, there is a warmth to the man that makes him good company throughout the book, and charm in his downright language, as when he said, \"When I was young I had very strong religious views, and was brought up to a thoroughly orthodox way; but after leaving home my ideas got broader, and on studying these things for myself, without any influence from parents, or ministers, I came to the conclusion that I knew just about as much about it as anybody, and I knew nothing.\"</p><p>Mr. Snow is the author, most recently, of \"Disney's Land: Walt Disney and the Invention of the Amusement Park That Changed the World.\"</p><p>'George Hearst' Review: A Head for Metals</p>",
