  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Style & Fashion -- 20 Odd Questions:  Mindy Kaling  ---  The writer and producer on sweatpants,  sweet treats and smelling like Rihanna  ----  By Marshall Heyman",
  "text": "<p>\n  The first 18 months of the pandemic were especially productive for Mindy Kaling. \"I was lucky I was pregnant for a big chunk of it,\" said the Los Angeles-based producer, actor, writer and mother of two. \"Having a baby makes everyone seem productive.\" </p><p>\n  Ms. Kaling, 42, was equally prolific when it came to Hollywood output. \"I'm a writer. I had no distractions. So, that's what I did.\" She produced a second season of her Netflix high-school hit \"Never Have I Ever,\" with a third on the way. Also in the pipeline are a comedy about the L.A. Lakers and a Scooby-Doo spinoff series following the sleuthy and scientific Hanna-Barbera character Velma. (She voices a character on the Disney+ animated series \"Monsters at Work\" and is slated to voice Velma, too.) </p><p>\n  Premiering this month is her HBO Max series, \"The Sex Lives of College Girls,\" which follows four female roommates navigating hookups and gender politics at an East Coast school. One of the main characters is a South Asian nerd (newcomer Amrit Kaur) who aspires to write comedy. Another is played by Pauline Chalamet, sister of Timothee. </p><p>\n  While Ms. Kaling, who wrote for the Jack-O-Lantern humor newspaper as an undergraduate at Dartmouth, admits that some of the subplots in \"College Girls\" come from her real-life experiences, \"definitely none of the sexier parts do.\" </p><p>\n  Like her character on \"The Mindy Project,\" Ms. Kaling is obsessed with fashion -- especially handbags. Here, she talks about splurging on a Birkin, the makeup skills she learned in lockdown and her love of Moscow Mules and sticky toffee pudding (though not necessarily at the same time). </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Some of the most expensive things I own are: my handbags, but I amortize them over so many uses. During Covid, I decided to be that kooky ancient socialite and get a bright pink Hermes Birkin. It was a present I got myself. I'd been eyeing it. I just thought, what an unnecessary flex to own a bright pink Birkin. If I hadn't bankrupted myself on that, I'd get one of those adorable, puffy Bottega Veneta Cassette Bags in neon green or some useless color. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I'll never get rid of: my gold James Banks Code Bracelet. You can pick stones and line them up. Mine has the birthstones of my daughter, son and mom: emerald, sapphire and diamond. I wear it every day. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My closet is: about to explode. It's organized by color and item type. There's a dress section, a coat section, a headband nook. I've only worn athleisure for the last year and a half. It's a huge waste of the armory of clothes I've accumulated. I'll walk right by a glittery Alexander McQueen gown to grab gray sweatpants. It's sad. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My go-to sweatpants are: by Tkees. They're not super fancy Rick Owens, but they fit great. They're slouchy, but not sloppy. I can drop my kids off at school in them and I feel no guilt about using them as napkins. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I finally learned how to: apply blush during the pandemic. I never knew where the \"apple of my cheek\" was, but now that I do, I like the cream blushes by Beautycounter. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  In 90 seconds: I can do my skin-care routine. I take off my makeup with Drunk Elephant Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser. Then I use Tatcha's Rice Polish: Classic Foaming Enzyme Powder and, for toning, La Mer Oil Absorbing Tonic. Then I do a Joanna Vargas Rejuvenating Serum, Creme de la Mer and go to bed. Occasionally, I'll sit in bed pushing my face up like Lily Bart with a gua sha. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  When I shot a movie with Rihanna: she smelled so good. I was too shy to ask her what fragrance she wore, so I looked it up myself and bought it. It's Love, Don't Be Shy by Kilian. It's decadent and has undertones of marshmallows. I wear it on special occasions. I'm not 100% sure that I can pull it off, and no one has said that I smell like marshmallows, but I do feel enhanced by the idea of Rihanna. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I'd like to visit: Copenhagen because of the Tivoli Gardens and because I love anything related to Hans Christian Andersen. I saw a Martin McDonagh play about how strange and quirky he was. His stories are so good and violent and not at all appropriate for children. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I love: the sculptor and performance artist Nick Cave and his gorgeous Soundsuits. I'd like one so I could display it in my house and sometimes wear it. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My favorite living actor is: Leonardo DiCaprio. Everyone says Timothee Chalamet is the next DiCaprio. I think they have a lot in common. The camera loves their faces. After seeing \"Dune,\" I re-watched \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" and \"Romeo + Juliet.\" Those really hold up. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I can't handle: a dirty martini. I like a sweet alcoholic drink that's close to Kool-Aid, so I get a Moscow Mule with vodka. They often put candied ginger in it, so it's kind of like dessert. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My favorite dessert is: sticky toffee pudding. The Abingdon in London has a very good one. It's nothing beautiful to look at. It has no production value -- it's just a black ball in brown goop, but it's warm and delicious and tastes great with cold vanilla ice cream and scotch. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  When 'The Mindy Project' ended: [former NBC executive] Bob Greenblatt gave me a grand piano. We were having breakfast at 30 Rock, talking about musicals. He's an accomplished pianist. I said I could only play well enough to do Christmas carols -- my rendition of \"White Christmas\" would bring you to tears -- but I didn't have a piano. Days later, there was a Steinway at my house. It was the most romantic non-romantic gift I've ever received. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A great show-offy app I like is: SkyView, which tracks the stars. It's useful with my daughter. She's interested in the stars, and it makes me seem like this genius scientist. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Young people who want to work in comedy should stop: asking to take people they admire out for coffee to pick their brain. It's better to say, \"I love what you do. How can I help you?\" It's so much more fun to come with me to set. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I wish I could have dinner with: the [late] director Mike Nichols. I don't know what his food restrictions were, but I'd probably serve Indian food. He had the most varied, interesting career. </p><p>\n  -- Edited from an interview by Marshall Heyman </p><p></p>",
