  "title": "MANSION --- The New HOTTER Malibu --- Decades after Larry Ellison started buying up Malibu real estate, a new group of billionaires is sending prices in the famed beach city even higher. Not everyone is happy about it.",
  "text": "<p>\"There's less of a sense of local community, because the people aren't here,\" said Mr. Stern, 69. Messrs. Zell and Riley didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Malibu, a beach city about 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, has changed drastically over the last few decades, morphing from a largely undeveloped surf mecca into a pricey playground for celebrities and the uber-wealthy. The change -- spurred in part by investment from tech titan Larry Ellison -- has sent Malibu real-estate values skyward.</p><p>Malibu home prices have climbed even higher since the pandemic hit. During the crisis, some of the country's wealthiest people fled to Malibu, lured by its uncrowded beaches, sunny weather and relaxed, surftown vibe. They vied to purchase the most sought-after properties, picking over the already small number of available homes for sale. Much like other high-end markets across the country with limited inventory, the Malibu market \"took off like a rocket ship,\" Mr. Stern said. And despite mounting evidence that wealthy buyers are pulling back from luxury markets across the county, Malibu activity shows little sign of letting up.</p><p>Malibu residents say they are accustomed to out-of-town celebrities and billionaires, but even they are shocked by the newest round of big-ticket home sales. The Bohemian character that lured wealthy buyers to Malibu in the first place, some locals said, is on the verge of being irrevocably lost.</p><p>Some of the prices being paid for homes in Malibu are \"out of control high,\" said lifelong Malibu resident Mikke Pierson, 62, a former mayor and planning commissioner who is now on the city council. He added: \"Malibu always had sort of a typical-small-town vibe, even though there were wealthy or famous people here as well. But it had much more of a blue-collar feeling and a lot of the residents had small horse ranches. Now, those are almost entirely gone.\"</p><p>Over the past year, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and his wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, have bought three separate Malibu homes for a combined $255.5 million. Since 2019, WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum has purchased two neighboring compounds in the Paradise Cove area for a total of $187 million. The sellers were entertainment executive Ron Meyer, who sold his house for $100 million, and entrepreneur and philanthropist Diana Jenkins, who sold her property for $87 million. In another major Malibu deal, rapper Kanye West paid $57.3 million for a house designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, according to people familiar with the deal.</p><p>Overall, the number of Malibu home sales of $5 million and up swelled to 81 last year, up from 39 in 2019, according to appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In the first quarter, the median price for a single-family home shot to $6.99 million, compared with $4.25 million during the same period of 2021.</p><p>Malibu's full-time population has fallen even as its home prices have soared. The city had an estimated population of 10,429 as of July 2021, a 17.5% drop from April 2010, according to U.S. census data. That decrease is partially due to housing being destroyed in the 2018 Woolsey fire, but another factor is that many homes are now owned by part-time residents, Mr. Stern said. The number of children in Malibu public schools this year was roughly 1,100, down from about 2,500 in the 2003-04 school year, according to a city report.</p><p>For many wealthy buyers, the allure of Malibu is its relaxed atmosphere, which allows them to disappear from public view.</p><p>\"People who you normally see on TV all dressed up, here they don't shave or comb their hair,\" Mr. Stern said.</p><p>That was the case for \"Undercover Billionaire\" star Grant Cardone, who bought a $40 million home on Carbon Beach this year. He said he was drawn to the laid-back vibe in Malibu. \"People can be themselves a little bit more here,\" he said.</p><p>Another reason for Malibu's popularity among the uber-wealthy is that its beaches are significantly less crowded than those in Santa Monica or Venice Beach.</p><p>And then there's Larry Ellison, the co-founder of tech giant Oracle. Starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Ellison started buying up numerous homes in Malibu. He now owns around 10 homes on Carbon Beach, and locals say they occasionally spot Mr. Ellison around town or on his yacht docked off Paradise Cove.</p><p>But Mr. Ellison didn't stop at buying homes. He also has ownership stakes in multiple buildings and commercial ventures that helped convert Malibu from a rustic and rundown surf city into an upscale destination, according to his real-estate agent, Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency. Mr. Ellison turned the PierView Restaurant and Cantina, a casual local eatery popular, into a high-end Asian restaurant before turning it over to the private club Soho House. The Windsail, another casual restaurant, was transformed into a Nobu, which has drawn celebrities such as the Kardashians and Justin Bieber. The Casa Malibu Inn, a low-key 1950s hotel, became the Japanese-inspired Nobu Ryokan Hotel, where rates start at $2,000 a night, according to the hotel website. Mr. Ellison didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Rappaport said many wealthy buyers are looking to emulate Mr. Ellison's approach, piecing together larger compounds. Today, however, \"it's next to impossible to assemble multiple lots on any prime beach in Malibu because it's already been done, and the people that own those properties don't need to sell at any price,\" Mr. Rappaport said.</p><p>Malibu's inventory crunch has been exacerbated by the complex planning approval process overseen by the city and California Coastal Commission, said Mr. Pierson. Meanwhile, the city was swamped with applications from homeowners applying to rebuild after the Woolsey fire, he said.</p><p>\"If you want something that's already done, you're going to pay for it,\" said Mr. Stern.</p><p>Mr. Cardone said his experience speaks to how limited the inventory is in the area. He wanted a house larger than 8,000 square feet, directly on the sand, that wasn't a teardown or in need of a major renovation. He found only about two properties on the market that fit that criteria.</p><p>The house he ultimately bought wasn't even for sale. He made an unsolicited offer for $36 million, then spent about 19 months haggling over the price with the seller, Vadim Shulman, a businessman with ties to Ukraine. Mr. Shulman couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>Mr. Cardone's new house sits on pilings driven into the sand. He said he knows the ocean's proximity will take a toll on the house and make it vulnerable to sea-level change, but he likes the salt residue on the windows in the morning and the sand piling up on his deck.</p><p>Living directly on the beach does have downsides, however. Mr. Cardone said that many of the neighboring homes aren't elevated enough to avoid prying eyes. \"You're walking on the beach and you're looking into their kitchens,\" he said.</p><p>The few Malibu homes on the market have eyebrow-raising pricetags. In May, self-storage billionaire Tammy Hughes Gustavson listed her late father's Paradise Cove home for $127.5 million. Former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner is asking $225 million for his Malibu compound on roughly 5 acres near Broad Beach. If the property fetches its asking price, it will set a record for California, according to Mr. Rappaport, the listing agent, who said there has been significant interest in the property.</p><p>After a divorce, juice-company owner Greg Alterman put his hillside Malibu home on the market earlier this month for $14.995 million, more than double the $6.494 million he paid for it in 2013, records show. Mr. Alterman said he knew Malibu values had skyrocketed, but he was still surprised when his realtor recommended that pricetag. He had done little significant work to the home, aside from revamping the garden and adding several golf holes on the hillside. In his view, the only downside of the market spike is that if he wants to stay in Malibu, he will have to stomach those prices on the buy side, too.</p><p>While many Malibu residents are pleased that their home values have grown, others lament the loss of the old Malibu.</p><p>Ruth Preven, 84, moved to Malibu from New York in the 1990s after her husband was offered a job directing a soap opera. Back then, she said, Malibu was \"funky.\" Now, she said, it's gotten too \"upscale\" and \"too Ralph Lauren.\"</p><p>Mr. Pierson said he recalls a community debate over whether to install a third streetlight on Trancas Canyon Road. \"Now on that same stretch of highway, I don't even know how many lights there are,\" he said.</p><p>Real-estate investor Richard Weintraub, who has lived in Malibu on and off for decades, said nowadays he feels like \"everyone is fighting all the time.\" Spats in recent years include a furor over whether to add permanent lighting to Malibu High School's football field, Mr. Weintraub said. Opponents worried that the lights would destroy the ambience of the area, while others said the lights were necessary to allow students to play night games. And for the past few decades, billionaires have battled over public access to beaches.</p><p>Still, longtime residents like Mr. Weintraub can sell their homes for exorbitant sums. In 2018, Mr. Weintraub relocated to L.A. with his family, selling his Malibu home for roughly $50 million. He later sold a second beach home to Mr. Andreessen for $44.5 million.</p><p>Mr. Cardone said he believes that deals like those made by Mr. Koum and the Andreessens will result in values rising across the board. \"My net worth thanks them,\" he said.</p>",
