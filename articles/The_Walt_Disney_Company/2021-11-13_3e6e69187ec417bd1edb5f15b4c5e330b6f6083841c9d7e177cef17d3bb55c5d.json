  "text": "<p>\n  TESLA INC. </p><p>\n  TSLA -4.8% </p><p>\n  Elon Musk has a new adviser: Twitter. The Tesla boss pledged to unload 10% of his stockholdings after polling users on the social-media platform. He proposed the idea Nov. 6 because \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance,\" and promised to abide by the poll results \"whichever way it goes.\" Roughly 58% of voters were in favor of a sale, and 42% were opposed after more than 3.5 million votes were cast. Since then, Mr. Musk has made a string of stock sales worth roughly $6.9 billion. Tesla shares declined 4.8% Monday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  HERSHEY CO. </p><p>\n  HSY +1.9% </p><p>\n  Hershey is trying to create a classic combination: salty and sweet. The candy maker plans to spend $1.2 billion to buy Dot's Homestyle Pretzels and Pretzels Inc. The goal is to expand Hershey's growing lineup of salty snacks, which includes SkinnyPop popcorn and Pirate's Booty cheese puffs. Chief Executive Michele Buck said the pretzel deals are the next step in Hershey's vision to become a snacking behemoth. The Hershey, Pa.-based company wants to diversify its business beyond candy and chocolate as shoppers lean toward healthier snacks. Hershey shares rose 1.9% Wednesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. </p><p>\n  GE +2.7% </p><p>\n  Is the industrial conglomerate coming to an end? General Electric and Toshiba are each splitting into three units, reviving the debate about the ideal structure for a manufacturing company. GE said Tuesday it would separate aviation, healthcare and energy, while Toshiba announced a similar path Friday. The decisions follow Siemens AG's strategy of spinning off major divisions in recent years. GE shares rose 2.7% on Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE INC. </p><p>\n  RIVN +29% </p><p>\n  Rivian made a supercharged market debut. The electric-vehicle startup raised $11.9 billion in its initial offering -- more than any other U.S. listing since 2014. Wednesday's closing price gave Rivian a valuation that was higher than Ford Motor Co. and about on par with that of General Motors Co., demonstrating optimism about a larger industrywide pivot to electric vehicles. The shift away from gasoline in recent years is due to stricter emissions regulations and some governments' plans to phase out gasoline-engine vehicles. Rivian shares jumped 29% Wednesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  WALT DISNEY CO. </p><p>\n  DIS -7.1% </p><p>\n  Can the Beatles and a new \"Home Alone\" bring more eyes to Disney+? Walt Disney on Wednesday posted a significant slowdown in the streaming service's subscriber growth as pandemic-related lockdowns eased. Covid-related production delays are still wreaking havoc on its release schedule, and the pace of new content isn't expected to rebound until the second half of 2022. The company is relying on a coming Beatles documentary, additional Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm Ltd. shows and a new \"Home Alone\" feature to generate excitement. Disney shares lost 7.1% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  BEYOND MEAT INC. </p><p>\n  BYND -13% </p><p>\n  Investors are losing their appetite for Beyond Meat. The plant-based meat company on Wednesday posted a disappointing revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, citing pandemic-related uncertainty. Beyond Meat didn't see the sustained recovery it expected during the summer as a coronavirus variant spread, and it couldn't fill some orders due to labor shortages, according to Chief Executive Ethan Brown. Severe weather in Pennsylvania and an explosion at one of the company's key suppliers were also factors. Beyond Meat shares plummeted 13% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON </p><p>\n  JNJ +1.2% </p><p>\n  Band-Aids and prescription drugs will no longer have the same home at Johnson &amp; Johnson. The 135-year-old company plans to break up into two public companies, splitting a division that sells bandages, Tylenol medicines and Johnson's Baby Powder from a less predictable prescription-drug and medical-device business. Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said the company decided to make the change because the businesses, their customers and markets have diverged so much in recent years, including during the pandemic. J&amp;J shares rose 1.2% Friday. </p><p></p>",
