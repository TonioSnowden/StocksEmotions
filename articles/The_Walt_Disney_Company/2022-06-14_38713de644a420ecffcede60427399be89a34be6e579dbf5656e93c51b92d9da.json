  "title": "Disney Wins TV Rights, Loses Streaming Rights for Indian Premier League Cricket; Viacom18 partnership between Paramount Global and Reliance Industries outbids Disney for digital rights and will stream popular sports league's matches",
  "text": "<p>The results of the auction—conducted digitally over the course of several days—make IPL cricket the world's second-most valuable sports league on a per-game basis after the National Football League, said Jay Shah, secretary of the BCCI. Competition for the rights became fierce in recent months, with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube unit, Amazon.com Inc., and Sony Pictures Networks India in the mix at various moments, along with Disney and Viacom18, according to the BCCI.</p><p>\"The important thing here was transparency,\" Mr. Shah said. \"That's what allowed the price to climb so high.\"</p><p>Disney said early Tuesday morning that it bowed out of the race for streaming rights because the price got too high. \"We chose not to proceed with the digital rights given the price required to secure that package,\" the company said.</p><p>Shares of Disney were down nearly 2% in late morning trading Tuesday in New York.</p><p>Losing streaming rights to IPL cricket presents a major challenge to Disney's aspirations to quickly grow its global streaming subscriber base, analysts have said.</p><p>Disney has set an ambitious goal of signing up between 230 million and 260 million global subscribers to its flagship Disney+ streaming service by the end of fiscal 2024. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Disney said that it had 50.1 million Indian Disney+ subscribers—around 36% of its total user base of 137.7 million—and that half of its quarterly subscriber growth came from India, where viewers signed up to watch the IPL's two-month long season.</p><p>Some analysts have said that without IPL matches on the platform, Disney+ could lose tens of millions of Indian subscribers, which could make it significantly harder for the company to reach its subscriptions target. Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek, however, said on a recent earnings call that the target was still achievable, even without IPL, and that cricket was \"not critical\" to reaching the goal.</p><p>\"IPL is an important component of our portfolio of television channels in India, providing an incredible opportunity for us to showcase the Walt Disney Company's powerful global brands and iconic story telling, as well as Disney Star's impressive collection of local original content, to millions of viewers in India,\" Disney said in Tuesday's statement. The company noted that it has more than 100 local language TV programs in India already and plans to launch about 80 more this fiscal year.</p><p>Disney+ subscribers in India produce just $0.76 per month on average in revenue, less than one-eighth the level of revenue that subscribers produce in North American markets. Disney has reported in financial filings that its Indian subscriptions are a drag on overall revenue for its streaming business. The company doesn't disclose TV revenue by country, but India, with more than 70 Star channels, is one of few markets where Disney's television business is expanding.</p><p>The value of sports broadcast and streaming rights has skyrocketed in recent years. Disney has said in recent earnings calls with investors that roughly one-third of its $32 billion in content spending this year will be to secure sports rights.</p><p>IPL cricket has benefited from both the pandemic—when many viewers in the world's most populous country were glued to their TV sets at home—and from the league's made-for-TV format, with shorter matches and more opportunities for commercial breaks. Two new team franchises that were sold last year fetched more than 10 times the price that teams sold for when the league launched 15 years ago.</p><p>The sport's growing popularity is also reflected in the rising price of broadcast rights. The last time IPL rights were auctioned was in 2017, when media conglomerate Star India, then majority-owned by 21st Century Fox, paid about $2.2 billion for both broadcast and streaming rights.</p><p>Disney acquired broadcast and streaming rights in 2019 as part of its $72 billion deal for certain 21st Century Fox entertainment assets, including Star.</p><p>Viacom18 announced in April that it was partnering with Bodhi Tree Systems, a joint venture between Uday Shankar, a former CEO of Star India who later served as Disney's head of Asia operations, and Lupa Systems, a holding company controlled by James Murdoch, former CEO of 21st Century Fox. Mr. Murdoch is son of Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal. Bodhi Tree is backed by a $1.5 billion investment from the Qatar Investment Authority.</p><p>Paramount Global plans to launch its Paramount+ service in India next year, the company has said. IPL cricket matches wouldn't be shown on the service, according to a person familiar with the matter. Instead, Viacom18 plans to stream cricket matches on a separate streaming platform bundled with Paramount+ to steer more viewers to Paramount's library of movies and TV shows.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Wins TV Rights, Loses Streaming Rights for Indian Premier League Cricket</p>",
