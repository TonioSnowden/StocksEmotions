  "text": "<p>La Liga is confident it will win backing for a €2.7bn tie-up with private equity company CVC Capital Partners, despite fierce opposition from FC Barcelona and the threat&#xa0;of legal&#xa0;action from Real Madrid to block the&#xa0;deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>Spain's top football league has sent clubs a report from its bankers at Rothschild &amp; Co that says the deal offers a fair price, after its biggest two teams said CVC was underpaying. The proposal requires the support of 32 of La Liga's 42 clubs, which are due to vote on the tie-up in a secret ballot on Thursday. </p> <p>“We are going to have a big majority,” José Guerra Álvarez, corporate managing director at La Liga, told the Financial Times. “We are confident that the clubs are going to be free to decide whatever they want.”</p> <p>The private equity deal has become the latest flashpoint in a long-running power struggle between La Liga, which runs Spain's top two football divisions, and two of its most important clubs, just as Barcelona suffers the blow of losing star player <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01ed1255-7012-4853-ba4c-29fbb4856ab6\">Lionel Messi</a> to France's Paris Saint-Germain. </p> <p>Despite La Liga's confidence, Real and Barca have made clear they intend to do what they can to derail the tie-up. Barca has warned that it is “inappropriate” to sign a deal that would sell a share of the league's broadcasting revenues for the next half-century. It has accused La Liga of failing to present alternatives to CVC, while Real has claimed the deal is illegal.</p> <p>Real Madrid, whose president Florentino Pérez was one of the principal proponents of the defunct breakaway European Super League, has said that even if teams approve the CVC tie-up, the club will “take any legal action it considers appropriate” to prevent it.</p> <p>Under the proposals, CVC would buy a minority stake in a company holding La Liga's broadcasting and sponsorship rights for about €100m, giving it an 11 per cent share of revenues for the next 50 years. It would also contribute €2.5bn to be distributed to clubs as interest-free loans.</p> <p>Italy's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c8fc484-fcf5-46c4-b705-1282a0742437\">Serie A</a> and Germany's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15a10f7e-d32c-4cc3-9cc8-e600e9b38941\">Bundesliga</a> this year abandoned plans to let private equity companies buy into their broadcast revenues after failing to secure the support of clubs.</p> <p>But Guerra Álvarez insisted that “without this agreement, without this investment, without this partner, we are going to have difficulties to keep growing our TV rights [in a] difficult market”. </p> <p>Guerra Álvarez said the strength of its brand meant La Liga could withstand Messi's departure, but highlighted how the “entertainment business is changing a lot”, forcing the league to compete against new rivals such as streaming services. </p> <p>Rothschild's valuation report, seen by the Financial Times, said the bank “is of the opinion that the consideration offered by CVC is fair from a financial point of view”. The deal values the league at just over €24.2bn. </p> <p>The report noted that a group of premium content companies, including Netflix and Disney, were valued at almost 22 times their 2021 earnings, higher than the 15.1 multiple&#xa0;at which the CVC deal values La Liga. </p> <p>Yet Guerra Álvarez said La Liga could not be expected to achieve the same valuation as companies such as Netflix because their business models were fundamentally different.</p> <p>Rothschild said the private equity company, which previously owned Formula One and MotoGP, and has invested in rugby and volleyball, could help La Liga develop its digital business and extend its international reach.</p> <p>Overall, revenues at Spain's top-flight clubs fell 8 per cent year on year to €3.1bn in the 2019/20 season disrupted by the pandemic, falling behind the German Bundesliga, where revenues slid 4 per cent to €3.2bn. The English Premier League, the market leader, generated €5.1bn, down 12 per cent.</p> <p>CVC declined to comment. It said on Tuesday, however, that Real Madrid's legal action was “totally disproportionate and unfounded” and that the deal would “benefit everyone”. </p><p>Source: Samuel Agini and Kaye Wiggins in London 2021 'La Liga confident of securing victory in €2.7bn tie-up with CVC' FT.com 11 August.
