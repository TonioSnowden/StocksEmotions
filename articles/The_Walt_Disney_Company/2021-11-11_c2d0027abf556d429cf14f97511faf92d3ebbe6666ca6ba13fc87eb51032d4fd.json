  "text": "<p>Signs that troubled China real estate group Evergrande has again avoided a default also were credited for improving sentiment on Wall Street.</p><p>How are stock-index futures trading?</p><p>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 rose 25 points, or 0.1%, to 36,017.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 were up 17 points, or 0.4%, at 4,659.</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 gained 129.75 points, or 0.8%, to 16,110.50.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 240 points, or 0.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP slumped 1.7%.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>Stocks tumbled Wednesday after October consumer prices surged 0.9%, well above forecast, and annual inflation climbed 6.2%, a more-than-three-decade high. The data sparked fears the Federal Reserve may have to act faster and more aggressively to rein in inflation, with investors fleeing into gold, the dollar and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Hardest hit was the Nasdaq Composite, which saw its worst session since Oct. 4—as its technology and growth-geared stocks are viewed as more sensitive to higher interest rates. Investors were also dealing with a poorly received 30-year government bond auction.</p><p>Bond markets are closed for the Veterans Day holiday, but Wednesday saw the 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD30Y yields surge. Gold prices continued to push higher, after the biggest gains since mid-June on Thursday, while the dollar also rose.</p><p>The rise in yields marked a bounce from a sharp two-week decline that wasn't based on fundaments and was, therefore, unlikely to last, said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note.</p><p>“During that period, tech rallied and led markets higher, and we're seeing both trades now unwind. And given techs large weighting, that will be a headwind on the S&amp;P 500,” he said.</p><p>“But unless the Fed starts strongly hinting at an accelerated taper or a much- sooner-than-expected rate hike, we do not see yesterday's hot CPI or rise in yields as a reason to get more defensive,” he said, arguing it was instead reminder of the dominant trends in the market: above-normal inflation and rising yields.</p><p>See:Hot inflation undercuts one of the main arguments against stocks, strategist says</p><p>One lift for sentiment appeared to come from China's property sector. “Chinese equities are up 2% today on the news that the battled real-estate developer Evergrande HK:3333 managed to pay overdue interest on three bonds worth $148 million,” said Saxo Bank's chief investment officer, Steen Jakobsen, who noted that was also aiding sentiment for U.S. equity futures.</p><p>A softer stance from officials there on the sector also helped rally those stocks, said Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, in a note to clients. “Beijing is apparently prepared to relax the rules around how much leverage property developers can take on, allowing distressed companies some breathing room,” he said.</p><p>Read:China's Evergrande once again sidesteps default, while sector rallies on signs of Beijing ease</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Tesla Inc.TSLA shares rose more than 3% in premarket trading. Securities and Exchange Commission fillings on Wednesday afternoon showed Musk selling more than 4.5 million shares for close to $5 billion.</p><p>Walt Disney Co.DIS stock was down more than 4% after the entertainment giant disappointed on theme park revenue and subscriber numbers for its Disney+ streaming service.</p><p>Beyond Meat Inc.BYND shares tumbled 18% after a weak quarter and poor outlook from the plant-based burger maker.</p><p>Lordstown Motors Corp. RIDE shares rallied 13% after the electric-vehicle maker announced a $230 million deal to sell its plant to Foxconn.</p><p>SoFi Technologies Inc.SOFI stock climbed 16% after the financial-technology company's better-than-expected earnings, strong member growth and product uptake numbers.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY,&#xa0;a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.2% after hitting a 15-month high on Wednesday.</p><p>The U.S. benchmark&#xa0;crude contract&#xa0;CL00CLZ21 fell 80 cents to $80.54 a barrel. Gold futures&#xa0;GC00 climbed 0.9%, to $1,864.90 an ounce.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600&#xa0;XX:SXXP rose 0.2%, while London's FTSE 100&#xa0;UK:UKX rose 0.3%.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 1% and China's CSI 300 Index XX:000300 rose 1.6%, while Japan's Nikkei 225&#xa0;JP:NIK gained 0.6%.</p>",
