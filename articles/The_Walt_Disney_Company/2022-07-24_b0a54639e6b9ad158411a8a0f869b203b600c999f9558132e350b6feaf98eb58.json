  "title": "Disney Shows First R-Rated Movies on Disney+; 'Deadpool,' 'Deadpool 2' and 'Logan' superhero films launched on the streaming service Friday",
  "text": "<p>\"Deadpool\" follows the adventure of a foul-mouthed mercenary who cracks jokes during assassinations, and features scenes with nudity and sexual themes. \"Logan,\" the story of X-Men superhero Wolverine, was rated R for language, brief nudity and \"brutal violence.\"</p><p>Disney is making a major push into adult-oriented general entertainmentcontent. In recent earnings calls, it highlighted increased spending on shows like \"The Dropout\" and \"The Kardashians,\" both streaming on Hulu, the Disney-owned service that has emerged as Disney's fastest-growing streaming platform. The company says that about half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without children.</p><p>In March, Disney added several shows to Disney+, including \"Luke Cage,\" \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Daredevil,\" that had story lines from Marvel comics and came with TV-MA ratings, the television equivalent of an R rating.</p><p>At the time, Disney's direct-to-consumer division required subscribers to opt into more-expansive parental controls to access those titles, and it mounted a public-relations campaign to spread the word about the required changes to the Disney+ app's settings.</p><p>The addition of those shows, plus Friday's addition of R-rated movies, prompted outrage from watchdog groups and some parents on social media, who said that R-rated movies don't belong in a family-friendly platform like Disney+.</p><p>\"Disney+ was supposed to be a safe space for kids,\" said Melissa Henson, director of programs for the Parents Television and Media Council, a nonpartisan, nonreligious organization that advocates for more family-friendly content on TV and streaming platforms. \"Disney used to be a brand that parents could trust implicitly, and I think that trust has been eroded.\"</p><p>The organization says that when Disney+ was launched in 2019, it committed to not having mature content on its platform. Ms. Henson commended Disney for requiring subscribers to proactively opt-in to content with TV-MA or R ratings but said it should have kept more-mature superhero titles on Hulu.</p><p>\"It feels like a bait and switch,\" Ms. Henson said. \"They pull the families in with family-friendly content and now, less than four years later, they're going back on their promise.\"</p><p>Disney has been moving toward more adult themes in its broader content offerings for some time in foreign markets.</p><p>In Europe, the Hulu series \"Pam &amp; Tommy,\" which details the release of a sex tape between actress Pamela Anderson and heavy metal drummer Tommy Lee, including extended scenes of the Tommy character conversing with his own animatronic sex organ, streams on Disney+ through its Star service, which is included on the platform.</p><p>More mature content is coming to Disney+. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige has said that a new Deadpool sequel produced by Disney will also be R-rated. The coming animated series \"Marvel Zombies\" will carry a TV-MA rating.</p><p>\"This will be a family-friendly show\" for families who \"love gore,\" joked Brad Winderbaum, head of streaming series for Disney-owned Marvel Studios, at an event Friday promoting the show at San Diego's Comic-Con.</p><p>Actor Ryan Reynolds, the star and title character of the Deadpool movies, mocked the outrage on Twitter on Friday, writing, \"We're supposed to announce Logan and Deadpool will soon be the first R-rated movies on Disney+. But we all know some Disney movies should already be rated R for irreversible trauma.\"</p><p>Hugh Jackman, who stars as Wolverine in \"Logan,\" thanked Disney for putting R-rated films on Disney+ but jokingly called the decision \"questionable\" in an Instagram post.</p><p>Disney says that \"Deadpool\" and \"Logan\" belong on Disney+ because the service is home to all Marvel titles, and the decision to add them was \"all driven by brand association.\" The company noted that it did a high level of outreach in March for the shows that were added.</p><p>Rob Liefeld, the veteran comic book author who created the Deadpool character, said that the R-rating on the movies is a natural evolution.</p><p>\"The 10-year-olds who powered 'Avengers' to zillions of dollars? They're 20-year-olds. Do you like at 20 what you liked at 10? No, you don't,\" Mr. Liefeld said at a panel Friday at Comic-Con.\"The way that the superhero movie is going to stay alive is by giving us more mature options.\"</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Shows First R-Rated Movies on Disney+</p>",
