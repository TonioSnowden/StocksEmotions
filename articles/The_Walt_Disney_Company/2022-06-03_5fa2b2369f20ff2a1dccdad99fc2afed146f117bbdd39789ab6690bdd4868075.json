  "title": "Disney Wrestles With High Price Tag of India Cricket Deal; The sport lures millions of Disney+ subscribers, but viewers pay low rates while broadcast and streaming rights are likely to be expensive",
  "text": "<p>If Disney is outbid, then analysts and investors expect the company's flagship streaming service, Disney+, to lose a significant portion of its India subscriber base. The loss would be a major setback to Disney as it tries to hit its target of signing up between 230 million and 260 million Disney+ accounts globally by September 2024.</p><p>The auction has grown increasingly competitive, with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube unit emerging as the latest likely bidder in a crowded field that already includes Disney, Amazon.com Inc., Sony Pictures Networks India and Viacom18, a joint venture between ViacomCBS and Reliance Industries Ltd., among others, according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the league's governing board that is conducting the auction.</p><p>The minimum bid price for all IPL rights—including television broadcasts, streaming and international rights outside of India—that will be considered by the BCCI is $4.4 billion, said Jay Shah, the board's secretary, or roughly twice the level of the reserve bid when the rights were last auctioned in 2017.</p><p>Mr. Shah said the higher price reflects the surge in popularity of the IPL, which last year drew about 600 million viewers, making it one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, along with English Premier League soccer and the National Football League. The league sold franchise rights to two new teams last year, each for more than $800 million, or about 10 times the average price for a franchise when the league began in 2008, Mr. Shah said.</p><p>\"During the pandemic, everyone was at home, and people got used to seeing IPL matches on at home, all the time,\" Mr. Shah said.</p><p>Given the starting point of $4.4 billion and the high level of interest, the rights will likely fetch $6 billion or more, according to people involved with the auction process.</p><p>The high price tag expected—potentially more than twice the $2.5 billion that the same rights package last sold for in 2017—creates a quandary for Disney, which currently owns the license to air IPL, both on its Disney+ Hotstar streaming service and on some of the roughly 70 television networks it owns in India.</p><p>India has become an important part of Disney's direct-to-consumer business, with the country's 50.1 million subscribers representing 36% of the total global subscribers to Disney+, the company's flagship streaming service, according to Disney's financial filings.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment. Sony confirmed that it plans to bid. ViacomCBS and Alphabet didn't respond to requests for comment. Disney declined to comment on the bidding.</p><p>In a February earnings call with analysts, Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said Disney+ in India is attractive to customers for more than just cricket matches, in part because the service includes Disney's library of animated, superhero and sci-fi films, as well as thousands of hours of local-language content.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is maintaining the rights to broadcast Indian Premier League cricket matches a must-win for Disney? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"While certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact\" for Disney if it isn't able to win the IPL auction, Mr. Chapek said. \"It's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it,\" he added.</p><p>Mr. Chapek said during the same call that while Disney planned to bid to retain the IPL rights, winning them was \"not critical\" to Disney achieving its goal of attracting as many as 260 million Disney+ subscribers by September 2024.</p><p>In its most recent financial report, Disney said that about half of its 7.9 million net new subscriptions in the quarter came from Indian customers, many of whom signed up just as this year's IPL cricket season began in late March.</p><p>Michael Morris, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said that whether or not Disney will retain the cricket rights is \"at the top of the list of questions\" he has gotten from Disney investors in recent months.</p><p>The trouble for Disney now, according to analysts and investors, is that Indian subscribers might be too costly to retain.</p><p>Disney earned just 76 cents in average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, from each of its 50.1 million Indian subscribers in the second quarter, according to the company's most recent quarterly earnings report. (ARPU is a crucial metric in judging the profitability of a streaming video platform.)</p><p>In North America, by contrast, Disney+ subscribers generated $6.32 in monthly revenue per user—more than eight times as much as those in India—in the most recent quarter. Subscribers in other countries, excluding India, generated an average of $6.35 in ARPU.</p><p>The highest average monthly revenue per user that Disney has disclosed for its India streaming business since it was launched in April 2020 was $1.03, in the first quarter of this year. The company has said in several quarterly and annual financial reports that revenue per user from India has been a drag on overall revenue for Disney+.</p><p>\"I would like nothing better than if they didn't get the IPL rights and walked back their subscriber number,\" said Michael Nathanson, a senior media analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. \"It would indicate a focus on financial discipline and return on capital.\"</p><p>If Disney were to win the June auction and pay $6 billion to secure IPL cricket rights, it would be paying $119.76 for each Disney+ subscriber in the country, implying that it would take more than 13 years at the current rate of revenue generation for Disney to recoup its investment. The IPL rights being auctioned in June only apply to the next five years.</p><p>\"The numbers, based on their direct-to-consumer revenue alone, make absolutely no sense,\" said Alex Morris, founder of TSOH Investment Research in Florida and a Disney shareholder.</p><p>Disney became owner of the cricket rights in 2019 when it acquired Star India as part of its $71 billion deal for some of 21st Century Fox's assets. Star paid $2.5 billion for the exclusive license to broadcast and stream IPL.</p><p>The biggest unknown factor in the deal, according to Mr. Morris, the investor, is how much revenue Disney generates each year from licensing deals and advertising on cable and broadcast TV stations in India and other countries. Revenue from its India TV business could help offset the high cost of IPL cricket rights, he said, but Disney doesn't disclose those figures publicly.</p><p>While in general, Disney has been moving away from the global linear TV business—the company shut down about 130 foreign TV stations in 2020 and 2021—it still maintains dozens of affiliate networks in India.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Wrestles With High Price Tag of India Cricket Deal</p>",
