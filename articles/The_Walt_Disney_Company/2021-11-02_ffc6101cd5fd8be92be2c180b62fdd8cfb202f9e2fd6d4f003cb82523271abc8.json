  "title": "China Pens 30,000 Visitors In Park After Covid-19 Case",
  "text": "<p>\"I never thought that the longest queue in Disneyland would be for a nucleic-acid test,\" one visitor said on social media.</p><p>Disney 's gargantuan mainland park turned into a giant testing site late into Sunday evening, with guests required to be tested before they were allowed to leave. The last one walked out at 10:30 p.m., a Walt Disney Co. spokesman said. Disney , which is a minority owner in the resort and has seen a spectrum of responses to Covid-19 at its parks, had to comply with China's local protocols, the spokesman said.</p><p>The shutdown illustrates the lack of control Disney and other Western firms have in China, especially as officials work to quell Covid-19 outbreaks. The world's largest entertainment company has yet to see park attendance return to pre-pandemic levels, and Sunday's shutdown highlights the difficulties of reopening the global tourism economy while the threat of outbreaks still looms. China recorded 54 domestic Covid-19 cases on Monday, a rate that is extremely low compared with other countries, and no one tested at Disney was positive, according to state reports. Nonetheless, the infections have prompted business closures and mass testing.</p><p>The testing requirements at Shanghai Disneyland were triggered after a woman who had visited the park Saturday was alerted by her hometown authorities that she was a close contact of a confirmed case. The woman was by then on her way home by train but was immediately transferred to a hospital at the next stop in Hangzhou because of the risk that she could have been exposed to the virus. She tested positive early Sunday, according to information released on government social-media accounts.</p><p>Sunday's Disneyland visitors were ordered to self-isolate for another 24 hours before a second test. The park and Disneytown, a shopping and dining complex, will be closed until at least Wednesday, Shanghai Disneyland said.</p><p>The mass testing proved a surreal scene: Videos shared by guests on social media showed swarms of people -- many in Halloween costumes -- lining up for tests. One showed the Disney evening fireworks erupting behind workers in hazmat suits.</p><p>Disney employees continued the display as planned so guests would have something to watch while they waited, a Disney spokesman said, and park workers helped manage crowd flow to avoid everyone trying to leave at once. They handed out power chargers so guests could charge their phones, and families with younger children were allowed to leave first.</p><p>In the last fiscal year before the pandemic shut park operations, the division that includes Disney 's theme parks accounted for more than a third of annual revenue, with $26 billion, and registered the fastest-growing operating income of any segment of the company. But the parks have struggled over the past 18 months after months of closures and reduced-capacity restrictions cost Disney billions of dollars in lost revenue. The closure of Disney parks and movie theaters around the world accelerated Chief Executive Bob Chapek 's plans to focus on streaming efforts like its Disney+ service, where success in subscriber growth has been cheered by Wall Street and kept its stock price afloat throughout the pandemic.</p><p>The theme park reopened in May 2020 as China sought to reboot parts of its pandemic-hit economy. Since reopening its parks, Disney executives have gradually lifted restrictions and increased capacity.</p><p>Disney 's Shanghai park first opened in 2016 after the company spent years wooing Communist Party officials, a $5.5 billion expansion for Disney 's biggest division in its most important foreign market. Since then, attendance figures have lagged behind Disney 's U.S. parks, but the location remains a beachhead with attractions based on Marvel superheroes and \"Toy Story.\"</p><p>Shanghai Disneyland was the first Disney park to close in January 2020, as the pandemic spread throughout China. Disney later closed all its parks, costing the company billions of dollars in revenue.</p><p>In the U.S. Disney has had to wait for state officials to adjust guidelines that allow reopenings -- Walt Disney World in Orlando has been open since summer 2020, whereas Disneyland in Southern California was closed until April. Both parks continue to implement some restrictions.</p><p>In China, consumers have adapted their habits to adjust to sporadic disruptions to daily life in the pandemic, economists have noted, though continued containment measures could weigh on already sluggish economic growth.</p><p>Shanghai Disneyland said it would refund tickets and notify guests as soon as there was a confirmed date for resumption of activities. Guests who visited the park over the weekend must isolate themselves for two days and be tested for Covid-19 several times over the next two weeks.</p><p>The park is 57%-owned by a state-backed consortium, Shanghai Shendi, and 43% by Disney . In the four years to 2017, its annual income rose 70%. In 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, the unit's operating income rose 11%.</p><p>---</p><p>Miho Inada and Zhao Yueling contributed to this article.</p>",
