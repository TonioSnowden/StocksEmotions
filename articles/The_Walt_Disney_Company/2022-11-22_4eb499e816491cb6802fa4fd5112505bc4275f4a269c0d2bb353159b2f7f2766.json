  "title": "Disney do-over: can Bob Iger pick up where he left off?",
  "text": "<p>As Bob Iger was honing his pitch to the Disney board of directors to select him as the replacement for then-chief executive Michael Eisner in 2005, he sought the advice of a trusted political consultant.</p> <p>The adviser, Scott Miller, told Iger he could only succeed if&#xa0;he focused on his plans for the future, rather than dwelling on Eisner's mistakes. Iger took the lesson to heart. “I can't do anything about the past,” he wrote in his memoir. “[W]e don't get any do-overs.”</p> <p>Now, as Iger assumes the top job at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/725b01e3-d084-43ce-8fde-e1569668ad2a\">Disney</a> for the second time, following the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9277a18-18f6-42ea-a1fb-7e762120846a\">ousting of his successor</a> Bob Chapek, it may be harder for him to avoid do-overs. Iger, who served as chief until 2020 and chair until January, will be revisiting strategies with which he is intimately familiar.</p> <p>Iger will have to take a hard look at Disney's lossmaking streaming business, which he introduced to great fanfare in December 2020. Wall Street is also demanding a plan to deal with the rapidly declining television business, a traditional cash cow&#xa0;in which Iger cut his professional teeth. And the board has tasked him, again, with helping to find his successor.</p> <p>“Iger's return is probably a net positive, as he's generally highly thought of among investors, content creators and consumers,” said one of the company's top-10 shareholders. “He was responsible for many of the strategic decisions and acquisitions over the past couple decades that made Disney into what it is today.”</p> <p>Under Chapek, Disney's theme parks division posted an impressive rebound from the depths of the coronavirus pandemic, in part through the kind of aggressive price increases that analysts believe Iger opposes. And its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69e1cc1e-9c64-4000-b47f-a7e448107a5b\">streaming business has grown rapidly</a>, reaching 235.7mn across Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus. </p> <p>But shareholders are no longer willing to fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/streaming-services\">streaming</a> growth at any cost, as they were in the early stages of Disney's foray into the business. Disney shares fell 13 per cent earlier this month after it reported that quarterly operating losses had risen by $800mn to $1.5bn because of exploding content spending and marketing expenses. Days later, Chapek announced a cost-cutting plan.</p> <p>Iger has wasted little time in tackling an issue at the heart of Disney's streaming business: a management&#xa0;structure that Chapek created to ensure that the services had a steady flow of original content. </p> <p>Under his plan for the Media and Entertainment Distribution division, Chapek stripped studio chiefs of much of their traditional authority to determine budgets and distribution strategy. Those decisions were placed under the authority of Kareem Daniel — a central Chapek lieutenant who was dismissed by Iger on Monday. &#xa0;</p> <p>Creative executives bristled at the lack of autonomy under Daniel, hurting morale to the point that some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9277a18-18f6-42ea-a1fb-7e762120846a\">complained to the board</a>. “We have been worried that the restructuring . . . has hurt the morale of the creative leadership and has created more bureaucracy, which has slowed decision-making,” analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote in a research note released after Iger's return.</p> <p>Iger, who prides himself on his close relationships with the creative community, sought to lift their spirits on Monday in a memo to the group, known internally as DMED. </p> <p>“It is my intention to restructure things in a way that honours and respects creativity as the heart and soul of who we are,” he wrote, pledging to&#xa0;create a “more efficient and cost-effective structure”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Iger's return is also expected to lead to renewed calls for Disney to address the acceleration of “cord-cutting”, which is hurting pay TV channels such as the ESPN sports channel. In September, Iger said linear TV “is marching to a distinct precipice, and it's going to be pushed off”, leading analysts to conclude that he will take an aggressive approach to reducing costs. </p> <p>Earlier this year, activist investor Dan Loeb urged Chapek to spin off ESPN to&#xa0;reduce Disney's debt load. Chapek rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying he had a plan to&#xa0;restore the network to growth. Analysts at MoffettNathanson said they now expect Iger to slash costs at ESPN, including by being more selective about spending on sports rights as they come up for bids.</p> <p>Loeb had also pushed Disney to buy out Comcast's stake to give it control over the Hulu streaming service, a perennial discussion that is expected to be revived now that Chapek is out of the company.</p> <p>While Disney faces challenges on several fronts, some investors say its shares, down 38 per cent this year, are good value given the collection of assets that Iger assembled during his first stint as chief, including Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox — some of the most valuable franchises in the entertainment business.</p> <p>The issue of who will eventually take the reins has been a vexing one in the past for Iger, 71, who delayed his retirement from the company four times before passing the baton to Chapek in February 2020. This time round, the Disney board&#xa0;has given him a two-year term and a mandate to set the company's “strategic direction for renewed growth”.</p> <p>However, the top-10 investor said: “This isn't a forever solution. We'll be addressing the succession plan again within the next 12 to 18 months.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Another shareholder, whose company has been cutting its position in Disney, said Iger's return raised larger concerns about its culture. “It says something at Disney that there's such a dearth of internal talent that there's no one else to fill the spot,” the shareholder said. “How does [Iger] find a replacement in such a short period of time?”</p><p>Source: Christopher Grimes in Los Angeles and Harriet Agnew in London  2022 'Disney do-over: can Bob Iger pick up where he left off?'
