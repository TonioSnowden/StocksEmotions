  "title": "Bonds: Reviving Your Rusty Conversation Skills --- What to say to the question, 'How are you?' -- and other tips on talking",
  "text": "<p>Zoom -- where many of us have been chatting during the pandemic -- isn't a natural way for humans to converse. Instead of fluid dialogues, we've been participating in a series of mini-monologues. We've jettisoned many of the nonverbal cues that are important in a conversation, things like body language, facial expressions and looking at our watch to signal it's time to wrap up. In their place, we've relied on \"raise hand\" buttons or, worse, clumsy new cues that don't facilitate real communication. (Ever considered how silly we look grinning and waving frantically as we log off?)</p><p>And on Zoom, we don't even have to pay attention; we can mute and multitask. I was reminded of this point yet again last week, when a woman I was in a meeting with fell asleep. She was still snoozing 15 minutes later, when we all signed off.</p><p>It's time to learn to converse again. \"Imagine you were a runner and you stopped for a year. It would naturally be difficult when you started running again and you would have to build the skill back up,\" says Sean Horan, professor and chair of the department of communication at Fairfield University in Connecticut. \"It's the same thing with communication.\"</p><p>I spoke with Dr. Horan and other communication experts to get advice.</p><p>-- Master small talk</p><p>Consider it social grease. Small talk gets the conversation going. \"And it's especially important now because we are reacquainting with people we haven't seen in more than a year,\" says Dr. Horan. \"These opening conversational routines are how we begin to reconnect.\"</p><p>To start, find common ground. The weather is perfect for this, says Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and author of 11 books on communication, including \"You Just Don't Understand.\"And it's got another plus going for it, she says: \"No one has control over it, so no one can get blamed or take credit.\"</p><p>Try commiserating. (Another benefit of the weather!) Sports teams, long lines, transportation delays and other people's noisy children are all fertile topics.</p><p>Keep the small talk going until you can establish a rapport. You can do this by digging down on a topic rather than jumping from one subject to another. Ask questions. Aim to learn something.</p><p>And don't shy away from the pandemic as a subject. Yes, it's a big and sometimes loaded topic. But we all have it in common and there are plenty of small-talk areas within it, Dr. Tannen says. \"Try some discussion that looks back and some that looks forward,\" she says. \"So you can ask questions about how the pandemic affected their life and how they got through it, such as: 'Did you work from home?' And then some that look forward: 'Are you going to eat indoors at restaurants now?'\"</p><p>-- Plan ahead</p><p>People are going to ask how you are. And nowadays the question is more than just a perfunctory greeting. Most folks want to know the answer.</p><p>It helps if you have it ready, says Courtney N. Wright, associate professor of communication studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She recommends deciding in advance what you want to share with other people. And think about how this may differ by relationship or day. \"What is your answer for friends, workplace colleagues, people in your faith community? What is your answer on days when you just don't have as much energy?\" she says.</p><p>Dr. Wright recommends giving your answer a time stamp. (\"Today has been a good day.\") This allows you to set some boundaries for yourself. She also suggests choosing your spin. (\"I'm glad to be here.\") \"This way, answering doesn't take you into the depths of the magnitude of the past year,\" she says.</p><p>It's also OK to say that you're not up for sharing at the moment. But remember to ask how the other person is -- and to listen to the answer. \"You want to be mindful of the transactional nature of the conversation,\" says Dr. Wright. \"And you want to be compassionate.\"</p><p>-- Ask questions</p><p>Everyone likes to talk about themselves. And they'll think you're a great conversationalist for directing the conversation to them.</p><p>Questions are also a great way to deflect the attention away from yourself -- especially helpful if you don't feel like sharing or the other person is prying, says Georgetown's Dr. Tannen. \"It can be anything you think they might like to talk about -- a hobby, their job, their kids,\" she says. And if you don't know them well enough to know what they like? There's always the weather again, she says.</p><p>-- Segue smoothly</p><p>This helps move the discussion along. It can also get you out of \"conversation jail\" -- when the other person is dominating the talk.</p><p>Listen closely for an opportunity to change the topic, says Candice Thomas-Maddox, professor of communication studies at Ohio University Lancaster. A smooth jump will be from one topic to another that is loosely related. Did the other person just mention that his workplace is going to require masks again now? You can use that to pivot to your vacation plans. \"Speaking of masks, do you know what Disney World's policy is? We're thinking of taking the kids.\"</p><p>Try to introduce some positive topics. Everyone's tired of talking about the pandemic and all the bad news. \"We all like to be around someone who is positive -- it makes it more fun and makes you more likeable,\" says Dr. Thomas-Maddox. \"And if you share something positive, the other person will have to follow. They'll seem like a jerk if they don't.\"</p><p>And if someone has shared something emotional, be sure to acknowledge their feelings before moving on, says Fairfield's Dr. Horan. \"You want to demonstrate that you've heard them,\" he says. \"You could say: 'I'm sorry that this happened to you; that sounds really stressful.'\"</p><p>-- Exit gracefully</p><p>Here's where those nonverbal cues come in handy, says Ohio's Dr. Thomas-Maddox. Take a step back to increase space. Wave at someone across the room. Go ahead and peek at your watch.</p><p>Show appreciation. \"It was great to see you. I'm glad we got to catch up.\" Dr. Thomas-Maddox says you'll also want to frame the conversation positively, even if it wasn't all upbeat. You can say something like: \"I'm glad to hear you've been hanging in there.\"</p><p>And if you'd like to see the person again, say so.</p><p>\"A positive exit will hopefully set the stage for future conversations,\" she says.</p>",
