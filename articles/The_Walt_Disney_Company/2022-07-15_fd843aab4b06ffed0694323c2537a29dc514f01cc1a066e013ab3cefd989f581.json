  "text": "<p>\"Since Wordle burst onto the scene, it's undoubtedly been a staple in social and pop culture vocabulary,\" Hasbro Gaming executive Adam Biehl said in a statement. \"We're beyond thrilled to work with New York Times Games to bring our gaming worlds together and extend Wordle in new ways.\"</p><p>Wordle was created last October and quickly exploded in popularity. Its simplicity is its strength: Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word of the day. Correctly guessed letters appear in yellow — or green, if it's in the exact place in that word. Players are encouraged to share their results, as anyone who's browsed their Twitter or Facebook news feeds in the past year can attest to.</p><p>Also see: 'If you consistently get Wordle in 3 or less, you are cheating': Players of the popular word game use shortcuts of all kinds</p><p>The New York Times bought the game from developer Josh Wardle in January. The Times said it now has millions of players daily.</p><p>In the board-game version, dubbed \"Wordle: The Party Game,\" one player is designated the host, and picks a five-letter word, while the other players have six chances to guess it. The fewer attempts a player needs to solve the word, the fewer points they get — but as in golf, the lowest score wins. It will offer four ways to play: classic play, fast, timed or teams.</p><p>Also read: Immortalize yourself as a Star Wars or Power Ranger action figure for $60</p><p>The hit online puzzle Wordle is being turned into a board game</p>",
