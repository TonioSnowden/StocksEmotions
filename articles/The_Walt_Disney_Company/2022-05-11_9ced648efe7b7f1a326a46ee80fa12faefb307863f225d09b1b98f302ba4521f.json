  "text": "<p>Elon Musk yesterday said he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bf4e8db-e35c-40fd-9fdc-bfff6745e90f\">reverse Donald Trump's ban from Twitter</a>, accusing the social media company of leftwing bias and aggravating political divisions in the US.</p> <p>“I think it was a morally bad decision, and foolish in the extreme,” Musk said of Trump's lifetime ban from Twitter. </p> <p>“I would reverse the permaban [on Trump],” added Musk, who has agreed to buy Twitter for about $44bn. </p> <p>The social media company banned Trump from its platform soon after a mob of the former president's supporters invaded the US Capitol building on January 6 last year. </p> <p>The comments, made at the FT's <a href=\"https://car.live.ft.com/home\">Future of the Car</a> conference, marked a sharp escalation of the Tesla chief executive's attacks on Twitter's attempts to weed out hate speech and misinformation. </p> <p>“Banning Trump from Twitter didn't end Trump's voice,” Musk said. “It will amplify it among the right. This is why it's morally wrong and flat-out stupid,” he said in his first interview since agreeing to buy Twitter two weeks ago. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Watch:</strong> Musk's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50d2861e-fdeb-487c-b052-f2021558e87d\">full interview</a> with the FT's Peter Campbell.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Tesla chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87e5eff2-ff1a-4d46-93e0-5b9f889d00df\">swatted away</a> questions about whether Twitter will weigh on his wider business interests, writes Richard Waters.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas. Here's the rest of the day's news — Gordon.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Lisa Cook becomes first black woman to serve on Federal Reserve board</strong> The professor of economics at Michigan State University is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5efe5b80-4dc0-4700-bcc7-9a9dc6a2c5f6\">the first black woman to serve on the central bank's board of governors</a> in its 109-year history. The Senate confirmed her appointment after vice-president Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Plus</strong> Treasury secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that overturning Roe vs Wade would have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a39475c6-5196-4c0f-b738-2bd8e8a84507\">“very damaging effects”</a> for the US economy.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Vladimir Putin preparing for ‘prolonged conflict' in Ukraine</strong> The US believes Russian president Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d95a2a5-3e6f-412b-9a90-02cae25f1b54\">has not changed his aims in Ukraine</a> and that his focus on the south-eastern Donbas region is a temporary shift “to regain the initiative” after failing to capture Kyiv, director of national intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers yesterday.</p> <p><strong>3. Philip Morris International strikes $16bn deal</strong> PMI, which is best known for selling Marlboro outside the US, has agreed to buy a Swedish tobacco company in its biggest bet yet on the alternative cigarette market. Swedish Match owns <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef5aa545-f017-4dc1-8955-76b6e1a5ee8b\">the largest maker of oral nicotine pouches</a> — or so-called snus — which have grown in popularity beyond their home market in recent years. </p> <p><strong>4. Global investment banks in China finally turn a profit</strong> All but one of the global investment banks in China <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daa35e03-a7c9-4bb1-aa02-27eafbdfe2e5\">finally managed to eke out a profit last year</a>, according to figures reported by the banks and seen by the Financial Times. A regulatory shift by Beijing in the past two years has allowed western banks to take full control of their operations and expand their influence in China's colossal financial sector.</p> <p><strong>5. Peloton losses widen </strong>Shares in the connected-fitness company closed down nearly 9 per cent yesterday after it reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2468133c-6374-4bec-a946-0441aefd788d\">higher losses than expected</a> and revealed it has borrowed $750mn from its banks to strengthen its balance sheet. The company has been left with excess inventory after consumers returned to gyms and fitness centres following the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> Inflation data out later is expected to show annual price rises fell slightly in April compared with March but remain near the highest levels for four decades. Joe Biden yesterday backed the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat surging inflation and said fighting rising prices was his administration's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c29e562-eb41-4fc0-b3b1-f6e3f4a9e9fb\">“top economic challenge”</a>. </p> <p><strong>Outlook for US markets</strong> The inflation data will be the main event for markets today. Ahead of the release, futures contracts are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a498e1e7-4426-42eb-8c70-ff6f09af8b3a\">pointing to a positive open</a> on Wall Street for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 after they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4ff5ea-f3cc-442d-acdf-6ae16f9126c3\">eked out a small gain</a> yesterday.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy </strong>Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta branch of the Federal Reserve, will discuss monetary policy and the economy at <a href=\"https://www.worldaffairscounciljax.org/calendar/sold-out-an-update-from-the-atlanta-fed-economic-outlook-and-monetary-policy/\">an event hosted</a> by the World Affairs Council of Jacksonville, Florida.</p> <p><strong>Company</strong> <strong>earnings</strong> Investors will be keeping a close eye on how many subscribers Walt Disney's streaming platform added in its most recent quarter, following Netflix's recent warning that subscriber numbers would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b63a57-0d46-41c7-8f6b-c61d388db039\">fall by 2mn this quarter</a>. Other companies reporting include doughnut maker Krispy Kreme, fast-food chain Wendy's, electric vehicle maker Rivian, dating app Bumble and Beyond Meat.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>A soft landing in the US is possible but unlikely</strong> If one believes inflation in the US will just fade away after a modest tightening, one must still think inflation is mostly “transitory”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b71d690-86a9-4315-ae67-57876acc6161\">argues Martin Wolf</a>. That is highly optimistic, he says, inflation does not usually just fade away in such a strong recovery as the US is experiencing.</p> <p><strong>Who will pay to put Ukraine back together again?</strong> Western nations are beginning to weigh the costs and planning needed for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/179501fa-2bae-481b-bff4-54933eb74459\">postwar reconstruction</a>, which will rival anything since the second world war. But, write Ben Hall and Sam Fleming, it will hinge on reducing corruption and forging a genuinely close relationship with the EU.</p> <p><strong>The race to mine lithium in America's backyard </strong>China dominates the supply chain for manufacturing lithium batteries, including mineral processing. But as the US attempts to surge ahead in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd6f2dd0-1dad-4747-8ca4-cb63b026a757\">global race to build green batteries</a>, Washington is encouraging mining projects — even amid criticism from environmentalists.</p> <p><strong>Clues but few answers in childhood hepatitis mystery</strong> Scientists are mystified by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58a97f95-074c-4528-8816-0a0bf2907a1b\">a new form of hepatitis</a>, which is thought to be afflicting more than 300 childrenacross the world and might be causing a wider, undetected wave of milder liver damage. Lockdowns, adenoviruses, Covid-19 and exposure to dogs have all been blamed. </p> <p><strong>FT business books: May edition</strong> Addressing social class at work and navigating politics to get things done as well as a guide to “superior management effectiveness” — our Work &amp; Careers team <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7381ea4b-86a9-4d3e-9c7e-4da1a102139a\">review</a> this month's top titles. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Working It podcast:</strong> As business travel returns Isabel Berwick asks whether we can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40940828-6d5d-4fb2-a903-5e2e8d868437\">justify those quick jaunts</a> in the post-pandemic age of climate crisis.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Things to do in Tokyo </h1> <p>Japan is home to eight winners of the Pritzker Prize, widely considered architecture's highest honour.
