  "title": "The World Ahead 2023; Companies are expected to take a stand on more social issues",
  "text": "<p>Large corporations are finding it difficult to remain neutral on political and social issues. They are feeling investor pressure from above, employee pressure from within and consumer pressure from all around to be more public in the way they express and defend their values. Alongside abortion, in 2023 companies will be judged on their approach to climate change and the energy transition, gay and transgender rights, racial diversity and ethical labour practices. Taking a political stand is not just about juicing sales or generating press coverage. It can also be a way to build and maintain a relationship with consumers based on trust and transparency, demonstrate a commitment to employee welfare and bake purpose into corporate strategy.</p><p>Activist consumers expect companies not just to speak out, but to be consistent as they do so. Such consumers are vocal about their disdain, and quick to express it on social media. Yet, contrary to popular belief, being more political does not necessarily require companies to be progressive. Chick-Fil-A, an American fast-food chain, has maintained a strong brand even as it has faced boycotts for supporting organisations whose “traditional” values some see as homophobic. Activist consumers, on either side, reward courageous consistency. Being political does not necessarily mean being progressive</p><p>Employees are also becoming more activist, and paying closer attention to the values espoused by employers. Covid-19 thrust conversations about employee welfare to centre stage; many firms responded to the Black Lives Matter movement by re-examining their approach to racial diversity. Internal pressure can be very influential in shaping a company's position. At Disney, an employee walkout in March 2022 pushed the company to issue a statement opposing Florida's “don't say gay” law, after the boss, Bob Chapek, had been slow to speak out against it. And over 100 American-based companies responded to the overturning of Roe v Wade by expanding reproductive health-care options for their employees. Firms now realise that responding to the needs of employees helps recruitment and retention.</p><p>Also involved in this shift are shareholders, who are aware that markets respond when companies take stances. A study by the Yale School of Management found, for example, that the shares of companies that pulled out of Russia soon after it invaded Ukraine outperformed those of companies that dawdled or chose to stay. For firms that failed to act swiftly, the risk of pushback from consumers in other markets, coupled with pressure from investors worried about falling share prices, was a potent combination.</p><p>But keeping all these constituents happy can be hard. Firms that take a stand against repression in China's Xinjiang region, for example, may win praise in the West but face retribution from Chinese consumers and officials. American firms based in Republican-leaning states were less likely to oppose the overturning of Roe v Wade. Moreover, consumers and employees can spot corporate window-dressing. A report from Brunswick, a PR company, says firms must back up their words with “substantive and tangible actions” to avoid coming across as bandwagon-jumpers. At the same time, a backlash has begun among bosses, investors and politicians who think “woke capitalism” has gone too far.</p><p>Corporate activism is not new. Some firms took positions against the Vietnam war in the 1960s and apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s. But as trust in politicians has declined, and companies have come to be recognised as powerful agents of social change, bosses are increasingly expected to speak out and take action. Some are happier than others to engage in such political action. But in 2023, they no longer have much choice.</p><p>■</p><p>Ore Ogunbiyi: Health-care and consumer correspondent, The Economist</p><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2023 under the headline “Time to take a stand”</p>",
