  "text": "<p>Plymouth, Mich.</p><p>Has anyone identified school districts in Florida or anywhere else where children under 8 are being taught about human sexuality? This is not a cultural issue. It is a fantasy. Yes, little children will ask questions about the composition of families, and teachers will struggle to answer these questions. But let's not catapult innocent discussion into a national debate.</p><p>Mark Ashton</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>It's weird that the left and its media allies are so upset about a law that prohibits teachers from discussing their views about sexual morality with young children when, at the same time, no teacher in any public-school classroom in our country can discuss his or her religious values with students. There may be no such thing as a \"Don't Say Gay\" law, but \"Don't Say God\" laws are everywhere.</p><p>Dennis Canfield</p><p>Chicago</p><p>Corporate Virtue in the Age of 'Don't Say Gay'</p>",
