  "text": "<p>That was below previous quarters and Wall Street expectations, putting Disney's streaming division on the defensive for the first time since its launch.</p><p>Disney shares closed down more than 7% Thursday following the report, reaching their lowest levels in nearly a year. The shares slid further on Friday.</p><p>The easing of stay-at-home orders and production delays for new programming contributed to the weaker sign-ups, the company said earlier this week.</p><p>Vulnerability in Disney's streaming division hits investors especially hard after they rewarded the service's pandemic success by sending shares to sky-high prices, helping the company weather many months of closed movie theaters and theme parks.</p><p>Disney is promoting its content and touting its expansion into new foreign markets to help reverse the slowdown, even as the company still has to wait months for some of its most anticipated new shows to premiere.</p><p>Production slowdowns tied to Covid-19 have caused a number of Disney's most anticipated titles to premiere in 2022 and beyond, and many of the shows and movies promoted as part of its \"Disney+ Day\" corporate holiday are still months away. On Wednesday, Disney executives said they expect their desired cadence of new titles on Disney+ to come in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p><p>Kareem Daniel, Disney's chairman of media and entertainment and a top lieutenant to Chief Executive Bob Chapek, said the Disney+ Day programming push \"keeps existing audiences engaged and brings new viewers in.\"</p><p>Now that lockdown orders have eased, Disney is incorporating its most important new initiative -- streaming -- into what has traditionally been its most reliable moneymaker: theme parks. Disney+ characters will be roaming the parks, and additional cost-saving perks will be available to subscribers who visit them, Mr. Daniel said.</p><p>The integration of companywide perks for subscribers is a relatively new development, one Disney hopes will draw in those fans who have yet to sign up. The company also announced a promotion that charges $1.99 for the first month of service, followed by its regular rate of $7.99.</p><p>Other streaming services such as Netflix Inc. have seen a pandemic-year surge in sign-ups slow as consumers venture outside the house. Netflix, however, recently rebounded a bit thanks to the viral hit \"Squid Game,\" illustrating how a must-see show can drive subscriptions.</p><p>Disney+'s next wave of programming shows that the company is relying on established brands and characters to bolster its menu of choices. Characters from years-old movies like \"Up\" and \"Ice Age\" are featured, as well as reboots or new installments of properties including \"Home Alone,\" \"Enchanted\" and \"Cheaper by the Dozen.\"</p><p>At each of Disney's divisions, executives are examining libraries for characters and storylines that can be revisited as a shorter film or new TV show.</p><p>For divisions Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm Ltd., the service is becoming more deeply integrated with the big-screen releases that still largely define the superhero and \"Star Wars\" franchises.</p><p>\"We wanted to have a place where we could bring and expand\" the superhero series, said Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige.</p><p>To that end, Marvel, which has already delivered the hit \"WandaVision\" to the service, has several new shows coming to Disney+, including \"Hawkeye,\" starring Jeremy Renner in the role he premiered in Marvel's theatrical films. Lesser-known characters such as \"She-Hulk\" are also getting a turn in the spotlight.</p><p>At Lucasfilm, Ewan McGregor, who first played Obi-Wan Kenobi in 1999, is returning to the role of the Jedi master in a new Disney+ show.</p><p>Disney also announced that several mid-budget feature films currently in production will premiere on the streaming service. Such titles include an updated take on \"Romeo and Juliet\" and a new installment in the \"Predator\" franchise.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
