Top Stories Today is an audio news digest that gets you up to speed on the day's headlines.</em></p> <p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes yesterday finished testifying after seven days of questions about her decision-making at the failed blood testing start-up, as one of Silicon Valley's most <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a5035c3-ff65-4721-9714-4dcfb3175006\">closely watched fraud trials</a> neared its conclusion.</p> <p>Holmes took questions about the company's revenue projections and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6960e721-1a18-4856-a487-4bd43c2db6b0\">media strategy</a> as prosecutors wrapped up their cross-examination. </p> <p>Holmes, who faces 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud — each carrying up to 20 years in prison, betrayed little emotion and appeared defiant battling suggestions that she misled investors about the capabilities of Theranos's devices. She has pleaded not guilty.</p> <p>Some of the most sensational testimony came on Tuesday when prosecutors questioned Holmes about revenue forecasts Theranos had produced for an investor, which differed from the company's own internal projections.</p> <p>Holmes' testimony included allegations of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c3977f0-7909-4da7-b5a6-295e06a81679\">abuse against her former boyfriend</a> and business partner Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. Lawyers for Balwani have denied the accusations.</p> <p>At its peak, Theranos was a widely heralded start-up whose aim was to lower the cost and discomfort of routine blood testing. Investors valued the company at $9bn. But in 2015, a Wall Street Journal article questioning Theranos's technology sent it into a tailspin, and it shut down three years later. </p> <p>Closing arguments in the case, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3be72070-bc6a-4181-8ae4-a729758511ce\">which got under way in September</a>, are scheduled for December 16 and could last as long as two days. </p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
