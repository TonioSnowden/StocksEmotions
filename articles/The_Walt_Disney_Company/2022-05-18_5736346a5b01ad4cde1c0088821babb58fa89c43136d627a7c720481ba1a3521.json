  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Mogul's SPACs Avoid U.S. Trading Freeze",
  "text": "<p>The trading suspensions hit several companies, including videogame developer Nexters Inc., which another of Mr. Tavrin's businesses took public last year. Analysts who track listings and a search of U.S.-listed companies show that Mr. Tavrin's SPACs appear to be among the only Russian-controlled companies currently trading in U.S. markets.</p><p>Mr. Tavrin isn't on sanctions lists. He is known as a previous business partner of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who has been sanctioned by the U.S. and other countries. Mr. Usmanov, a metals magnate, is one of Russia's wealthiest people and is viewed as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Messrs. Tavrin and Usmanov previously co-owned television assets including Disney Channel Russia. Mr. Tavrin was also CEO of Russian telecom company MegaFon PJSC -- which is majority owned by Mr. Usmanov -- from 2012 to 2016. Mr. Tavrin was photographed by the Kremlin receiving an award from Mr. Putin in 2015 after MegaFon and other companies installed telecom infrastructure as part of the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p><p>SPACs, known as blank-check companies, raise money and list on a stock exchange with the goal of merging with a private company to take it public. If Mr. Tavrin's SPACs find companies to take public and complete deals, he stands to make tens of millions of dollars on paper, depending on the share prices.</p><p>\"It seems potentially inconsistent,\" said New York University Law School professor Michael Ohlrogge, who studies SPACs.</p><p>A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment on the decision to let Mr. Tavrin's Kismet Acquisition Two Corp. and Kismet Acquisition Three Corp. continue trading while they pursue companies to take public. Mr. Tavrin declined to comment. The companies are named for Mr. Tavrin's family investment firm, Kismet Capital Group, which backed his SPACs.</p><p>Nexters and other suspended Russian companies, such as recruitment firm HeadHunter Group PLC, have said they aren't subject to sanctions. Exchanges typically suspend or delist companies if they don't meet regulations, could be in legal trouble or face other situations that might trigger major investor losses.</p><p>Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Tavrin's SPACs said in regulatory filings they were broadening their search for private companies to those with large footprints in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and would be less focused on Russia. Negative sentiment toward Russia could prevent the SPACs from doing a deal, they said in the filings.</p><p>The two SPACs have deadlines of February 2023 to find deals or else return the money they raised to investors and forfeit the several million dollars they paid to set up the blank-check vehicles.</p><p>Nexters, the Cyprus-based maker of \"Hero Wars\" and other videogames, has an office in Moscow but has said the U.S., Europe and Asia represent nearly 80% of its bookings and the majority of its critical personnel work outside Russia. Mr. Tavrin owns a roughly 6% stake in Nexters, valued at roughly $75 million early this year, according to FactSet.</p><p>Nasdaq suspended trading in the stock in late February.</p>",
