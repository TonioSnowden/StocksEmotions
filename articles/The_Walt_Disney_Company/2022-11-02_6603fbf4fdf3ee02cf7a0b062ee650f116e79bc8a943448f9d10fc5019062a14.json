  "text": "<p>To mark the anniversary and equip you with conversational fodder that will divert children (and children-at-heart), we've assembled some surprising facts and anecdotes from the brand's past and present lives. </p><p>Lego A/S celebrated its 90th anniversary in August. PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>1. Lego as Lifestyle</p><p>Die-hard adult fans of Lego (who call themselves \"AFOLs\") will tell you that collecting and building sets is a lifestyle in and of itself. But there are plenty of Lego home and \"lifestyle\" goods too. Target partnered with Lego last fall for a collection that included a range of gear, like a Lego-piece-shaped box with a handle, color-blocked fleeces and even dog leashes. See also: the \"Botanical Collection,\" which features buildable bonsai trees and bouquets, no green thumb required.</p><p>2. Backwards Compatibility</p><p>What do \"The Wire\" and Lego have in common? All the pieces matter. Every hard plastic Lego brick can connect to another, regardless of whether it was made 60 minutes ago or 60 years ago. It's what second-generation Lego owner Godtfred Kirk Christiansen called the \"Lego System in Play,\" after reorienting the company around its still relatively new stackable plastic bricks in the 1950s. This was a big shift. Earlier Lego releases were more conventional toys, like a handsome wooden duck.</p><p>3. Keep Rollin' Rollin'</p><p>In 2012, the Guinness World Records book identified Lego as the world's largest tire manufacturer. That year the company churned out roughly 381 million tires. Lego staff historian Signe Wise said the number in 2022 is much higher, clocking in around 700 million tires for the year. That's far more than rubber-burning rivals like Michelin and Bridgestone (who hold the second- and third-place titles as of 2021) produce.</p><p>4. The First Lady of Lego</p><p>It is no easy feat to become a Lego Master Builder, the people who build massive displays and run workshops for young visitors to Legoland parks. There are only 33 in the U.S. And until recently, none of them at Legoland New York, located in Goshen, were women. That changed last April, with the hiring of Danielle Ross. Her day-to-day responsibilities vary, but they typically involve both maintaining existing builds and creating new ones. Her broader focus is Lego's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts: She said she's trying to create Minilanders (oversize versions of Minifigs, the technical term for Lego characters) that depict many types of people, \"so that anyone can see themselves\" at the amusement park.</p><p>5. IP Everywhere</p><p>Marvel, DC Comics and \"Harry Potter\" do not just dominate pop culture, they also provide plenty of characters and environments for co-branded Lego sets. The first of these came in 1999, when Lego partnered with Lucasfilm in the lead up to \"Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace.\" Some older pieces might resemble iconic products—like some cars from the 1950s that look a lot like iconic Volkswagen vehicles—but these weren't official Lego \"branded products,\" according to Ms. Wise.</p><p>6. If You Can Dream It...</p><p>Many have tried re-creating the sets from their favorite TV show in Lego. But what if one could make money doing such things? Enter Lego Ideas: a Kickstarter-like program that lets people submit detailed photos of anything they've built for review by the Lego community. If 10,000 people choose to \"support\" the design (no monetary investment required), Lego will review it. If the design makes it to market, the original creator gets a cut of the profits.</p><p>7. They're Just Like Us</p><p>\"I grew up making Lego when I was eight, nine years old, and actually I continue it,\" superstar athlete David Beckham told Jimmy Fallon during a \"Tonight Show\" appearance in late February 2020. \"It calms me,\" he added. Mr. Beckham is one of many celebrities (see: Britney Spears, Daniel Radcliffe and Anna Kendrick) who tote their Lego bona fides in public. Yet their fandom pales in comparison to that of Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. Mr. Turner commissioned a 100,000-piece statue of himself as Darth Vader from Black Lego artist Ekow Nimako, who specializes in creating Lego art and sculptures through the lens of Afrofuturism.</p><p>8. Get Personal</p><p>This summer, Lego launched a digital replication of the in-store experience that lets you design a custom Lego character. (No, it doesn't need to have yellow skin.) The tool lets you customize your character's facial features, pick its outfit and select unique accessories for it to carry (say, a trident, even if you're more likely to lug a laptop in real life). Though the experience was taken offline recently for maintenance, Jay Ong, a Melbourne-based marketing professional who blogs about Lego in his spare time, said he and other Lego fans are excited about it: \"If [Lego can] crack the technology and allow it to scale, it's a really unique experience…. People see minifigures as extensions of themselves.\"</p><p>9. Massive Meetups</p><p>Lego has inspired fan events that rival TwitchCon or Comic-Con. Among the most notable is Skærbæk Fan Weekend, held near the Lego headquarters in Billund. Mr. Ong said these conventions provide a forum for \"die-hard, passionate, talented fans [to push] the envelope of what's possible with Lego.\" He's seen plenty of impressive builds, but one that stood out was a recreation of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields from \"The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King,\" which he said featured hundreds of minifigures. He estimates it cost thousands of dollars to build.</p><p>10. Clicks for Bricks</p><p>Why would you read a critical review of a Lego set? With the brand issuing special (and pricey) collector's sets, such as an expansive version of the Hogwarts Express from the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, it's worth knowing whether a set merits its price tag. Mr. Ong extensively covers Lego releases big and small on his blog, paying particular attention to the \"build experience.\" Is it challenging? Does the design incorporate an interesting shape? Is it relaxing? Mr. Ong recently reviewed the $350 \"Black Panther\" bust collector's set and, while praising the set as a fun build, critiqued Lego for its failure to include relatively cheap elements like a Black Panther minifigure and a stickered plaque instead of a printed plaque.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
