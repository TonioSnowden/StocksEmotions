  "text": "<p>Upon my return to the States, it's possible I am going to need to enlist in a new family, so if your family is taking applications for Thanksgiving 2023, let me know.</p><p>Of course, it's also possible a Thanksgiving without me will be my family's best Thanksgiving ever. My family won't miss me one bit—in fact, the whole experience will be twice as pleasant, and they'll collectively chip in to buy me a ticket out of town every year.</p><p>But just because I'm not around to ruin my family's holiday, doesn't mean I can't do my best to ruin yours.</p><p>Without further adieu, this year's Rules of Thanksgiving Family Touch Football, now in its 12th season:</p><p>* Important: This game isn't just the Thanksgiving Family Touch Football Game. This is also a tryout to quarterback the New York Jets on Sunday.</p><p>2. Of course, you could say that every year.</p><p>3. There are at least three people playing in your game who know that playing touch football is a terrible idea for their aging bodies, but it's too late to back out now.</p><p>4. My editor thinks I need a World Cup angle in this year's edition, and he's probably right. Soccer fever is upon us—at least as much soccer fever we can manage until there's a half-decent Thursday Night Football Game—and it's likely you'll have a relative who suggests playing Family Soccer instead of Thanksgiving Touch Football. Let me be clear: The only correct response is to politely ask this person to permanently leave your family.</p><p>5. There's also going to be a family member who will suggest replacing family football with a family pickleball tournament. I've thought long and hard about this, about the growing phenomenon of pickleball, how much I've personally enjoyed playing pickleball, and how many family members I know play it, and also, importantly, how pickleball, like touch football, can be played with a bourbon in one hand. After much consideration, I've reached the following conclusion about replacing football with Thanksgiving pickleball: No, absolutely not.</p><p>6. Of course, if you know pickleballers, they don't take no for an answer. This is why they are in a sweaty war with popped-collar tennis snobs. Pickleballers don't like being told where and when they can play pickleball, and pretty soon, you're going to hear that telltale donk-donk-donk that sounds like bears fighting with Tupperware, and you'll look out the kitchen window…and there will be a full-on pickleball game in the driveway.</p><p>7. Don't begin any on-field conversations with Twitter, FTX, My fantasy team or the Ohio State-Michigan game.</p><p>8. The game hasn't really started until a dog no one has ever seen before is running around the field and refuses to leave. This dog has one eye and answers to Roscoe. Roscoe also loves turkey and intends to stay for dinner.</p><p>9. Heads up: To begin the third quarter, Jim Irsay will replace your father with Jeff Saturday.</p><p>10. Also, by game's end, Bob Iger is coming back to replace you.</p><p>11. There may be little chatter at your Thanksgiving about the scramble to find Taylor Swift tickets—sad tales of rejected attempts and crashed computers. There will be one relative who will be extremely quiet during this discussion. This relative has 12 Taylor Swift tickets, and you should hold them hostage in the garage until they give you two.</p><p>12. I bet you have someone in your game who likes to use a lot of fancy football lingo (\"RPO,\" \"shell defense,\" \"jet sweeps\"). This person is almost always terrible at football, and quite possibly works for the Las Vegas Raiders.</p><p>13. Very specific rule: If your name is Jesse Gay, and you are 9 years old, you need to wear a collared shirt with nice pants to Thanksgiving dinner—that's that, buddy. And Jesse: Your Baltimore Ravens jersey isn't a collared shirt.</p><p>14. If your neighbor already has an inflatable Santa in his front yard, you may tackle this Santa. Ditto the Halloween pumpkin, if it's still out there.</p><p>15. Sure, Mom will let you try to play quarterback, but you're going to be on a very short leash. As always, Mom is ruthless and wants to win.</p><p>16. This year's halftime show is listening to your cousin try to pronounce \"Pulisic.\"</p><p>17. Be thankful for small things: You can drink beer at your Thanksgiving game. Here in Qatar, my Journal colleagues and I are going to play touch football, and then we're going to kick back and crush a 12-pack of Diet Mountain Dew.</p><p>18. If you catch yourself talking with a relative about your fantasy football teams, imagine instead that you're talking endlessly about turnip farming, because it's basically that.</p><p>19. As always, there's a Lions game on Thanksgiving, this one versus the Bills. The Lions have won three games in a row, and sit on the bubble of the NFC playoff picture. With all due respect to my Detroit friends, who have suffered too much, a Thanksgiving Lions game isn't supposed to have meaning. It's supposed to be background noise to the 90-minute nap you take before Dad starts passing around the cheese and crackers.</p><p>20. Ah, who are we kidding? Dad isn't passing around the cheese and crackers. He's eating the cheese and crackers by himself at the kitchen table.</p><p>21. When the game is over, please remove all dirty socks and clothing and leave them on the basement clothing rack, also known as the Peloton your parents bought last June.</p><p>22. Unlike soccer, Thanksgiving Family Touch Football cannot end in a tie. It may end in an ambulance, but never a tie.</p><p>From the Archives</p><p>* 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What rule would you suggest for this year's Thanksgiving Family Touch Football Game?</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>It's a Journal Tradition: 22 More Rules for Thanksgiving Family Touch Football</p>",
