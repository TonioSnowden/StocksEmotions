  "text": "<p>Like cuckoos in spring, the first political books of the next election season are appearing in France ahead of what might be a historic battle for the presidency in 2022.&#xa0;</p> <p>Such books are not rare: France is a fiercely literary nation and its presidents, ministers, members of parliament and bureaucrats rank among the world's most prolific political authors. They write a lot of fiction too.&#xa0;</p> <p>Edouard Philippe, President Emmanuel Macron's first prime minister and one of the country's most popular politicians, is the latest to join the fray with a quintessentially <a href=\"https://livre.fnac.com/a15669111/Edouard-Philippe-Impressions-et-lignes-claires\">French account</a> of his three years in office — discursive, elliptical and short of revelations about Macron but full of hints about how the country should be run by a centre-right leader such as himself.</p> <p>Michel Barnier, the EU's former Brexit negotiator and another possible presidential contender, will see <em>The Great Illusion</em>, on the four years that shook Europe, published next month. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire's 10th book, <em>The</em> <em>Angel and the Beast</em>, came out in January.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it is Philippe — half of whose beard went white with the stress of managing the <em>gilets jaunes</em> anti-government protests and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic — who is the focus of political gossip in Paris. He is thought to be loyal to Macron but has not ruled himself out as a candidate in 2022; some suspect he could “do a Macron”, emulating his 2017 trick of wresting the Elysée Palace from the hands of the man who had appointed him.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>In the past, French author-politicians have channelled the maritime musings of former footballer Eric Cantona (“When seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea,” he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbwV5XX6phU\">once intoned</a>). Former prime minister Dominique de Villepin wrote <em>The Shark and the Seagull</em> (“the perfect alliance of opposites celebrated by philosophers and poets”). Far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon examined the German economy in his book <em>Bismarck's Herring</em>.</p> <p>Although Philippe is mayor of the Channel port of Le Havre, he and his co-author, the MEP Gilles Boyer, have shunned the marine metaphors and chosen art and literature as the binding thread of <em>Impressions et lignes claires</em> (Impressions and clear directions). “If this book was a painting, it would claim to be Impressionist,” they write portentously, “with visible brush strokes, which taken separately can seem indistinct but seen together can sometimes portray a landscape, a person, an era.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Philippe and Boyer do disclose one ironic political secret: when advising presidential hopeful Alain Juppé four years ago, they suggested he choose Macron as prime minister and appoint Jean Castex to the post of secretary-general at the Elysée. Macron, of course, is now president, and Castex is the PM he named to replace Philippe.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rare personal anecdotes are more revealing. Philippe was so fearful of the responsibilities of prime minister that he lost <a href=\"https://www.purepeople.com/article/edouard-philippe-6kg-en-moins-avant-de-devenir-premier-ministre-j-ai-ete-pris-d-une-grosse-angoisse_a430985/1\">6kg in the 10 days</a> before he started. And he had “cold sweats” during the peak of the Covid-19 crisis last year when it seemed like France would run out of medicines and intensive care beds.&#xa0;</p> <p>On the whole, though, the tone of the book is unlike anything usually published in the UK or the US.&#xa0;There are no toe-curlingly frank anecdotes such as in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/574c78b5-1ef3-4cd5-a7b7-1996a51209e3\">Sasha Swire's <em>Diary </em></a><em>of an MP's Wife</em>, or even the pen-portraits of Barack Obama in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bd56745-3a89-4a38-83c6-9366b2ee5745\"><em>A Promised Land</em></a>, including his scathing description of then French president Nicolas Sarkozy with “his chest thrust out like a bantam cock's”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Instead, the reader of a French political book is expected to relish the author's literary pretensions and to be familiar with the cast of characters before reading the first sentence: Philippe does not refer to Macron by name until page 46.&#xa0;</p> <p>But maybe, just maybe, Philippe is the harbinger of a new, more populist style of French political writer.&#xa0;</p> <p>Along with the obligatory references to Churchill and de Gaulle and a series of French biographers and artists, he manages to pay tribute to Anglo-Saxon film and TV culture from <em>Game of Thrones</em> to <em>Star Wars</em>. Just visible in the cover photo of Philippe is a cufflink with the message: “May the force be with you.”&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:victor.mallet@ft.com\"><em>victor.mallet@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Victor Mallet in Paris  2021 'Of books and politics: is change coming to a French tradition?&#xa0;' FT.com 21 April.
