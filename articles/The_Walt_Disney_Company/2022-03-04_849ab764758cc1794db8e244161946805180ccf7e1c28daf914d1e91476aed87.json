  "text": "<p>Had Tonga erupted perhaps a year earlier, the event would have almost certainly been included in \"Super Volcanoes: What They Reveal About Earth and the Worlds Beyond,\" a fascinating book by the volcanologist-turned-science-journalist Robin George Andrews. Among its many enthralling encounters with volcanic exotica, we learn of an earlier Tongan eruption from some unnamed, unknown, underwater volcano that in August 2019 released \"gas-filled, head-sized blobs of lava\" into the South Pacific. Sailors in the area suddenly found themselves \"surrounded by a fleet of floating rocks a foot thick and covering an area of 40 square miles.\"</p><p>The central figures of \"Super Volcanoes\" are not to be confused with supervolcanoes, those big-gun eruptions like the one in Yellowstone some 2.1 million years ago, a \"Mephistophelian paroxysm\" that spewed \"588 cubic miles of shattered fire.\" Or the 1883 eruption in Krakatau that \"obliterated two-thirds of the entire island\" with the equivalent of 200 million tons of TNT and rang the Earth like a bell.</p><p>Mr. Andrews's superinteresting volcanoes are the ones that can only be described using superlatives such as biggest, highest, hottest, coldest, oldest, weirdest, fastest, farthest and so on. They occur throughout the solar system on all the planets, many of the moons and even on an oversize asteroid called Ceres.</p><p>13 Books We Read This Week</p><p>The shadowed vision of Charles Dickens, a quest to save America's urban scene and the explosive past and future of volcanoes. Plus: reading to make you feel at home.</p><p>Mr. Andrews begins with the dramatic story of the 2018 eruption of Kilauea on Hawaii, which added 900 new acres of land to the already Big Island. He takes us to Tanzania, where we encounter \"the world's strangest volcano,\" Ol Doinyo Lengai, \"a freak of nature\" that gushes carbon-rich lava as dark as motor oil but more fluid than water. Heading underwater, we learn about the intricate, glassy structures beneath Earth's oceans and the volcanoes that built them, divided by category according to the nature of their emissions: black smokers, white smokers and nonsmokers. These undersea volcanoes, we are told, \"are the true exhaust ports of the planet.\"</p><p>Eventually we find ourselves on Mars, in a 12 million-square-mile region known as Tharsis, where a period of prolific volcano-building on one side of the planet \"emerged so quickly, and became so massive,\" that it tipped the spin axis by 20 degrees and, we are told, broke the planet \"into pieces.\" On Venus, a planet \"ruled by volcanoes,\" we learn that the atmosphere is so heavy with carbon dioxide that the surface temperature was once recorded at 932 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's acidic skies may hold \"the most compelling evidence we have for alien life yet.\"</p><p>Every chapter straddles the psychological never-never land between myth and science. Japan's Mount Fuji \"feels less like a fact of science,\" Mr. Andrews writes, than a \"consequence of magic,\" becoming \"a perfect otherworldly pedestal to the cosmos.\" Volcanoes \"verge on the supernatural,\" being \"true and fantastical beyond our wildest imaginations.\" Our knowledge comes from \"scientifically explicable sorcery . . . the breathtaking theater of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.\" Every eruption delivers \"buried treasure.\"</p><p>The inspiration for the author's enthusiastic quasimagical style is made clear from his autobiographical snippets. Growing up in the U.K., Mr. Andrews tells us that he was an avid video gamer since the age of 4: \"Virtual domains had a strong influence on the way I saw the world.\" But it was Nintendo's \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" (1998) that \"blew my mind\" and gave a 10-year-old Mr. Andrews a \"desire to study Earth's volcanic splendor,\" eventually leading to a Ph.D. in volcanology, followed by a career as an award-winning science journalist. The book is laced with references to video games, as well as to \"Star Wars\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Dragon avatars emerge from their lairs, exhale fire and vanish. Volcanic \"wizardry\" abounds.</p><p>To maintain the tension between myth and science, Mr. Andrews sometimes must discount centuries of scrutiny and terabytes of data to create the impression that we still know precious little about volcanoes. \"The Moon really isn't what you think it is,\" he breathlessly tells us at one point. At another: \"We know surprisingly little\" about Venus. Also: \"Everything you think you know about Yellowstone is probably wrong.\" And so forth. In truth, we've come a long way since the days of attributing volcanic behavior to Hades, Vulcan or Pele, having developed well-calibrated models for nonexotic volcanoes.</p><p>Mr. Andrews also employs a tone that is perhaps a bit too colloquial. \"I want you to feel unbridled glee as these stories sink in and an indelible grin flashes across your face as you think: holy crap, that's crazy!\" When I first read that sentence, and many more like it, I winced at what sounded like exaggeration. But soon I was sucked in by his jaunty dramatic stories. The science writing is consistently exciting and illuminating and kept me reading into the wee hours.</p><p>Volcanism is the epoxy superglue that holds our ideas about the solar system together. Lava similar to that gushing from Kilauea covers the inner planets of Mercury, Venus and Mars. Lavas of water and methane ice occur in the asteroid belt and on the moons of the outer planets.</p><p>\"Earth may be normal to us,\" Mr. Andrews writes, \"but the universe has other ideas.\" Surveying the volcanic oddities of the solar system can help us visualize Earth's earlier incarnations and eons: the fiery-hot Hadean, the orange haze of the Archean, the ice crusts of the Cryogenian, the lush greenhouse of the Cretaceous and the polychrome geometric patterns of our Anthropocene cities and lands.</p><p>Spoiler alert. The metaphorical magma beneath \"Super Volcanoes\" is revealed only at the end. \"This book isn't about volcanoes—not really. It's about time travel.\" Using his storytelling skills, Mr. Andrews offers us a solar system resembling a \"boundless library, one full of books whose words are written in volcanic ink.\"</p><p>Mr. Thorson is a professor of geosciences at the University of Connecticut.</p><p>'Super Volcanoes' Review: The Cauldrons Beneath Us</p>",
