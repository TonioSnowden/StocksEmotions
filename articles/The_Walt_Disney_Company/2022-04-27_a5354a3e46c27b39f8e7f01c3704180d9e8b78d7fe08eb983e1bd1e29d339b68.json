  "text": "<p>One topic missing from Gillian Tett's article “Beware the rich persons' savings glut” is housing (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90404d0b-57aa-4163-b612-6e6ac594afe7\">Opinion</a>, April 22).</p> <p>Anyone with savings — you don't have to be super-rich — has been advised to invest in property ever since interest rates plummeted. </p> <p>From the amateur with one or two properties to the mega-investors amassing huge portfolios, landlords flashing cash and tax privileges disadvantage the first-time buyer and the renter, whose tenancy is all too often insecure, whose income goes disproportionately on rent, and who is unable to put down roots and plan for the future. </p> <p>Substandard housing or, worse, homelessness is surely one of the most damaging aspects of societal failure, impacting on both mental and physical health, on education, childcare, crime, on just about every aspect of life, while costing society more in the long run trying to patch up the damage done.</p> <p>UK housing need is clear from the Office for National Statistics table in the same paper. The great majority of what will be built will not help the poorest. </p> <p>The money provided by George Osborne, when chancellor, for Help to Buy went directly into developers' profits. It did not assist would-be private buyers starting out. It certainly didn't help those in need of secure social housing.</p> <p>Tett mentions philanthropy as one way for the ultra-rich to dispense with some of their cash. It might be safer to encourage a new generation of Peabodys or Guinnesses than to leave it to overblown housing associations or to pared-back local authorities who no longer have the expertise. Or just listen to Abigail Disney, and tax the billionaires.</p> <p>In the immediate term, I hope a handful of the über-rich do buy some fighter jets for Ukraine. It's the least they could do. </p> <p><strong>Judith Martin</strong> <br><em>Winchester, Hampshire, UK</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Perhaps taxing billionaires can end the housing crisis?'
