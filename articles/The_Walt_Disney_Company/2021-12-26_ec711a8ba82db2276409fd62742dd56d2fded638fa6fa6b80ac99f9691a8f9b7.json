  "title": "'Spider-Man' Keeps Saving the Day for Theaters Amid Weak Holiday Box Office Showings; 'Sing 2' hits the right note as 'The Matrix Resurrections' and several other new releases fall flat",
  "text": "<p>It's also left little for the other titles competing for attention in a vital week of moviegoing. The weekend gross of $81.5 million for \"Spider-Man\" was about $22 million more than the collective weekend grosses of the next nine highest-grossing films combined.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are you comfortable going to a movie theatre? If not, what would bring you back? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Of the new Christmas week releases, only the animated family film \"Sing 2\" registered a harmonious debut, with two other sequels—\"The King's Man\" and \"The Matrix Resurrections\"—falling flat and a handful of other new releases failing to catch on.</p><p>Hollywood faces a mixed bag heading into the final week of the year, which outside of the summer months, is the busiest time for moviegoing. School breaks and family reunions typically drive consumers to the theater every day of the week, but a combination this year of Covid-19 precaution and 18 months of sporadic moviegoing appear to have curtailed enthusiasm for the tradition.</p><p>While \"Spider-Man\" is doing his part keeping exhibitors afloat, the performances of other titles indicate a lagging ability for the industry to draw moviegoers out as they once did.</p><p>Major studios distributed half a dozen new films in wide release over the holiday weekend, yet only \"Sing 2\" is heading into the week with healthy returns. The movie, released by Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures, grossed $41 million since opening Wednesday, a strong showing in a year that has proved touch-and-go for family releases.</p><p>\"The Matrix Resurrections\" had the highest profile of the newcomers, since it was the first installment in 18 years for the franchise that introduced moviegoers to Neo, slow-motion bullets and the choice between the \"red pill\" and the \"blue pill.\"</p><p>However, WarnerMedia's effort to revive the \"Matrix\" appears to have short-circuited. The movie collected a weak $22.5 million since opening on Wednesday. Like other Warner movies released in 2021, it simultaneously streamed on the company's HBO Max platform. The studio didn't release specific information on how well the movie performed in homes.</p><p>News of the fast-spreading Covid-19 Omicron variant dented moviegoing this weekend to some degree, said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., which released \"The Matrix Resurrections.\"</p><p>That was especially true among older audiences, who gravitated toward the \"Matrix\" film.</p><p>\"Omicron definitely took some wind out of their sails,\" said Mr. Goldstein, turning the holiday box office into a story of \"two movies working and the rest of them not.\"</p><p>\"The King's Man,\" the third in a franchise acquired by Walt Disney Co. in its 2019 purchase of Twentieth Century Fox, is also failing to generate as much interest as its preceding two films did. It grossed $10 million over the weekend.</p><p>There is some holiday hope for the new films. Traditionally, each day between Christmas and New Year's Day fills auditoriums like a weekend evening at multiplexes, and movies that open poorly have been known to gain momentum in the days to come.</p><p>Two Christmas Day releases are going to need the help. \"Licorice Pizza,\" a drama about growing up in the San Fernando Valley directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, collected only $2.3 million since expanding on Saturday.</p><p>\"A Journal for Jordan,\" starring Michael B. Jordan in the true story of a soldier who leaves memories behind for his young son, joined other adult-skewing dramas in the box-office doldrums with $2.2 million.</p><p>Word-of-mouth can be critical during this time, which bodes well for \"American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story,\" an inspirational football movie from Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. It opened to a poor $6.2 million, but received an \"A+\" grade from audiences, according to the market research firm CinemaScore. \"Sing 2\" also got the highest mark.</p><p>Nonetheless, it appears \"Spider-Man\" will remain the hero who exhibitors needed, an outlier in this year's box office by nearly every metric.</p><p>The movie, released by Sony Pictures Entertainment, is the first film since the pandemic started to collect more than $1 billion at the global box office. Its domestic gross of $467 million in two weeks is double that of the amount the No. 2 movie of the year, \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" made in its entire run.</p><p>Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com</p><p>'Spider-Man' Keeps Saving the Day for Theaters Amid Weak Holiday Box Office Showings</p>",
