  "text": "<p>Federal Reserve officials discussed the possibility of moving the US central bank to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5639bf4a-43dd-4565-a0bd-fd71c732d4d3\">a “restrictive” policy stance</a> that would better fight inflation through more aggressive interest rate increases. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20220504.htm\">minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting</a> held in early May, most US monetary policymakers agreed on the need to keep increasing the Fed's main interest rate — set at a range of between 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent — by 50 basis points “at the next couple of meetings”.</p> <p>After the financial crisis the Fed pursued a highly accommodative monetary policy, reducing interest rates to record low levels and pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the US economy through a bond buyback programme to support business and households.</p> <p>It has been forced to adopt an aggressive approach towards tightening monetary policy this year to control inflation that is at a 40-year high. But there are concerns among economists and investors that this could undermine the strong recovery in the jobs market and lead to a recession.</p> <p>Investors, however, welcomed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0ca6b80-7040-418b-9ab4-2f769d5ba8c9\">the absence of a more hawkish monetary policy</a> from the central bank in yesterday's minutes. The S&amp;P 500 finished 0.9 per cent higher, rising shortly after the minutes were released, having been up 0.2 per cent beforehand. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent.</p> <p>Fed officials, including chair Jay Powell, are trying to engineer what they have described as a “soft” or “softish” landing for the US economy but have acknowledged it is a difficult balancing act.</p> <p>In public remarks, Powell has vowed to keep tightening monetary policy until the central bank sees “clear and convincing” signs that inflation is slowing and moving back to its 2 per cent target.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas and here's the rest of the day's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Beto O'Rourke interrupts press conference on Texas school massacre</strong> The Democratic candidate for Texas governor accused the incumbent Republican Greg Abbott of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a68b3c15-6c79-4d34-a4db-8cf054eb20e3\">“doing nothing”</a> to curb gun violence in the state at a press conference to give further information on the shooting of 19 young children and two teachers at an elementary school. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> The shooting at Robb Elementary School has reignited the gun control debate in America just as the National Rifle Association prepares to hold its annual meeting in Houston.
