  "text": "<p>The first novel in over 20 years from the much praised but inexplicably overlooked US author Joy Williams is a major event. Williams, long revered as one of the greats of American literature, and hailed by writers including Don DeLillo and Raymond Carver, has published four previous novels, four short fiction collections and in 2013 the micro-fiction <em>Ninety-Nine Stories of God</em>. Now aged 77, she has been a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award finalist, but her works are almost a well-kept secret. They should be much more widely read. Williams is a writer for our times: both visionary and caustic, knowing yet also full of wonder.</p> <p><em>Harrow</em>, Williams's fifth novel, a parable of the climate emergency with a distinctly apocalyptic theme, is, like much of her writing, preoccupied with death, it but also manages to be extremely funny: a prescient, yet abstract, and absurdist work. The novel is set in some future America, where the exhausted, tormented land has given up. Survival is a battle between humans and animals, a conflict that some win — cockroaches, for example, which have now evolved to the size of kittens — and some lose: “the owls lay fuddled and miserably starving in their hollows — their home, darkness had been taken away from them. The very earth had been pressed to chalk, to clay, as through a mangle.” Yet consumerism still thrives. “The amusement industry has heroically re-established itself. Disney World has rebooted and is going strong.”</p> <p>Khristen, whose mother had declared her “special” following her conviction that, as a baby, her daughter had for a few moments died and then come back to life, is a teenager adrift. Her parents divorced after her mother kept insisting that Khristen, whom she renamed “Lamb” was effectively a resurrection, and constantly tried to elicit from the child details of her assumed foray into non-life. Now her father is dead, and her mother has disappeared, after abandoning Khristen at a remote boarding school of gothic decrepitude, housed in “an old sanatorium surrounded by beetle-ravaged pines and staffed with nervous self-regard by arguably the cleverest minds in the country.” </p> <p>When the school is shut down in advance of impending catastrophe, Khristen at first tags along with a boisterous similar-aged group, The Fallout. This gang is “cheerful, ruthless, resourceful, self-absorbed and undespairing . . . The Fallout certainly weren't babies, nor would they be the resigned and ingravescent old. They doubted they'd last the year out. They didn't care.”</p> <p>Apathy rules in this landscape: only the old seem bothered. Khristen's forsaken state echoes that of the three nonconforming, motherless adolescent girls in an unnamed desert town who feature in Williams's last novel, <em>The Quick and the Dead</em>, from 2000, its title taken from the Book of Revelation.</p> <p>Khristen alights on the conference centre where her mother was last rumoured to be, called the “resort” by a group of misfits who permanently live in the macabre building. The group comprises elderly would-be eco terrorists, whose final earthly intentions are to annihilate particular companies and individuals they hold responsible for destroying the planet. Their targets are often irrational, and random: “Poets” is one scornful suggestion. Yet the “old delinquents”, as they are dubbed, are frail and either physically reluctant or incapable, even as their minds are on fire.</p> <p>Williams's generational interplay, constantly rumbling along in the background, comes to the fore in one indelible scene. The only other young person in the “resort” is Jeffrey, a savant who flings around jurisdictional aperçus like sweets. His mother Barbara, whose actions, such as sunbathing, seem deliberately counterintuitive to the current crisis, presents Jeffrey on his 10th birthday with a cake recreating Goya's most disturbing painting, “Saturn Devouring His Son”. It could be a metaphor for the entire book, the earth razed and exploited again and again — harrowed.</p> <p>Williams received the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction in 2021 for her body of work. Both in long and short form her writing reverberates with the moral gravity of Flannery O'Connor, and its bleak black comedy evokes more recent American writers, too, including the work of Nell Zink. <em>Harrow</em>'s short, dense pages unfold into a world of Kafkaesque distortion, its sharp wit and cruelty pierced with dreamlike language and imagery, and moments of almost unbearable poignancy. </p> <p>As the book draws to its dark conclusion, a hint of something miraculous, borne out from its opening chapter, flutters over the final paragraphs. In Williams's shattered world, destruction appears almost like the possibility of renewal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1800810016?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1800810016\"><strong>Harrow</strong></a> by Joy Williams, <em>Tuskar Rock Press £14.99/Knopf Doubleday $26, 224 pages</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Catherine Taylor 2022 'Harrow by Joy Williams — an absurd and poignant end of days parable ' FT.com 3 February.
