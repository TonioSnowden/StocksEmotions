  "text": "<p>with Leopoldo Villardi</p><p>Monacelli, 519 pages, $60</p><p>Robert A.M. Stern, who appreciates a good phrase, was tickled when Architecture magazine called him a \"suede-loafered sultan of suburban retrotecture, Disney party boy and notorious academic curmudgeon.\" He could hardly quibble. The fashionable suburban houses that made him famous in the 1970s -- classical abstractions with bow windows and gable roofs -- were indeed retro. He designed resort hotels for Disney at its theme parks across the world; created a model town in Celebration, Fla.; and drew up the plans that transformed New York's 42nd Street from civic gutter to tourist attraction. As for the suede loafers, Mr. Stern has never stopped wearing Guccis since he first put on a pair in 1965.</p><p>So he admits in \"Between Memory and Invention: My Journey in Architecture,\" Mr. Stern's disarmingly unpretentious look back at his six-decade career. Those have been riotous decades for architecture. They began with the authority of the modern movement in free fall, followed by a furious war of theory and ideas that came to rest in the exhausted standoff of today's \"starchitecture\" culture, in which celebrity takes the place of ideas. Through it all, Mr. Stern has shown a gift for being at the center of things. In the guise of a memoir, he has written what is in effect a capsule history of American architecture since 1960.</p><p>Mr. Stern was born in 1939 in Brooklyn, N.Y., something he insists on taking as a personal affront. \"Even now,\" he tells us, \"I can hardly bring myself to cross the bridge.\" He attended Columbia University, where he concentrated on American history and literature and discovered \"The Great Gatsby\" as a handbook to American culture. Given his early specialization in stylish Long Island summer houses, it is no surprise to learn that he rereads the novel regularly.</p><p>He entered Yale's school of architecture in 1960, at the very moment when Paul Rudolph, chairman of the department, was turning it into America's foremost incubator of architectural thought. Unlike Harvard, a veritable monastery of modernism, Yale was not dogmatic. It had a tradition of inviting critics with clashing views to visit, and it had no quarrel with history. Architecture students crammed Vincent Scully's spellbinding lectures on historic buildings, which he made seem urgently relevant to the present. This intellectual diversity and openness to history had its detractors -- \"no system, all freedom,\" the architect Louis Kahn complained -- but it meant that when modernism faltered, Yale could respond sure-footedly.</p><p>Mr. Stern, characteristically, became an intimate of both Scully and Rudolph, neither man easy to get along with. He served as Scully's teaching assistant and was soon addressing the formidable Rudolph as \"Paul,\" who in turn came to depend on Mr. Stern for student gossip. \"Things seem very dead without you in New Haven,\" Rudolph once wrote to his prize student. \"No one keeps me informed at all.\" Just how Mr. Stern achieved his easy intimacy with such prickly characters -- and there are a great many in this book -- he doesn't say, but one senses, with growing awe, a social dexterity at the level of genius. And some modicum of social skill is essential to a successful architect, who cannot begin to create until a client walks through the door. Without that, it doesn't matter how well one can draw -- and Mr. Stern readily admits that \"I am not blessed with great drawing skills.\" Nor engineering skills: He was permitted to pass his twice-failed course on structures only if he promised never to build anything larger than a house unless a structural engineer was involved. One of the pleasures of this book is Mr. Stern's ability to laugh at himself.</p><p>The truth is that at Yale he spent as much time writing as designing. He took a year off to focus on art history, beginning a study of the architect George Howe that would culminate in one of Mr. Stern's many pub-lished books. He then edited a special issue of Perspecta, Yale's student-run architectural journal, publishing prescient early essays by Robert Venturi and Charles Moore. Graduating with little professional experience, Mr. Stern took a position with New York's Architectural League, where he spent a year organizing exhibitions and lectures.</p><p>After working on the mayoral campaign of John Lindsay, the liberal Republican who was elected to lead New York in 1965, Mr. Stern joined the city's Housing and Development Administration. To this day, although a registered Democrat, he still considers himself a Rockefeller Republican -- \"perhaps the last one living,\" he writes.</p><p>All of this delayed his entry into professional practice. He was already a 32-year-old member of the faculty of Columbia before he finally took his licensing examination, during which the dean of Columbia's graduate school of architecture happened to walk by and said, \"Oh, Bob, I see you're not an architect.\"</p><p>Far from hindering Mr. Stern's subsequent career, these early detours gave it its distinctive texture. They placed him firmly in the world of history and ideas, even as they made him reliant on collaborators to execute his sketches. And if they made him conversant with historical forms -- a boon during the heyday of postmodernism -- they also freed him from the need to be self-consciously original. He cheerfully acknowledges every motif he appropriated from Venturi, Kahn and Rudolph, the ingredients of his early style before he learned to borrow from Stanford White and Edwin Lutyens. Such architectural name-dropping at last gave way to a highly abstract classicism, which has shown itself to be adaptable to every type of building, from his stately George W. Bush Presidential Library (2013) to 220 Central Park South (2018), Mr. Stern's thin-as-a-straw New York supertall.</p><p>It is bracing to read a book by someone with nothing to lose. The statute of limitations having expired, so to speak, Mr. Stern feels free to speak about former clients -- often with chagrin, especially when it comes to his celebrity clients, many of whom discovered him through \"Pride of Place,\" the eight-part PBS series he hosted in 1986. There is the long comedy of errors that delayed his house for Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley, who upon its completion promptly divorced and sold it to Jerry Seinfeld (who just as promptly tore it down). There is the day Mr. Stern put down the top of his convertible so that everyone could see him ferrying Barbra Streisand around East Hampton, N.Y. -- only to be stuck in traffic, giving her time to root around in his glove compartment. She found several tapes by Bette Midler and -- fatally for the commission -- none by Ms. Streisand.</p><p>Most characteristic is his encounter with Bruce Springsteen, who arrived at his New Jersey property with a friend, both on motorcycles and \"both fully togged in leather.\" Mr. Stern, who since 1970 has had his suits made by the same London tailor who outfitted Sean Connery as James Bond, was flustered by his sheer sartorial incompatibility with Mr. Springsteen. \"I said to myself: 'Bob, this is not for you.' I have to have a certain connection with my clients, and I just did not see it happening.\"</p><p>In countless vignettes like these, the book sparkles. But sequins alone do not make the dress, and for all its charming anecdotes, \"Between Memory and Invention\" suffers from its beginnings as an oral-history project, transcribed from tape-recorded interviews and fleshed out by Mr. Stern's writing partner, Leopoldo Villardi. The stories we tell an interlocutor, whom we cannot help wanting to impress, are different from the ones we tell ourselves; they present the public, not the private, self. Mr. Stern writes about himself much as he wrote about George Howe, with the historian's obsessive need to record every commission and project, every collaboration and partnership. Anyone who knows what a talented writer Mr. Stern is would gladly trade 50 pages of an exhaustive litany of projects for five pages of introspection.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Lewis teaches architectural history at Williams College and reviews architecture for the Journal.</p>",
