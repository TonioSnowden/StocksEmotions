  "title": "Business News:  'Wakanda Forever' Sets Mark  For November, Boosting Disney  ----  By Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>\n  The Black Panther has retaken the throne at the box office. </p><p>\n  \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" the long-awaited superhero sequel from Walt Disney Co.'s Marvel Studios, grossed $180 million in North America and $150 million in overseas markets in its opening weekend. It was the biggest-ever domestic haul for a November opening weekend, as well as the second-best theatrical debut of the year and 13th-highest opening weekend gross of all time. </p><p>\n  Based on the Marvel Comics stories set in the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda, the first \"Black Panther\" movie grossed $202 million domestically in its opening weekend in 2018 and went on to earn more than $1.3 billion at the global box office. </p><p>\n  The sequel's performance is a bright spot for Disney, which saw its share price fall 13% after the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth quarter financial results Tuesday, before recovering some ground later in the week. Losses have widened significantly at Disney's streaming business. </p><p>\n  Disney is hoping that its theatrical movie business will help it close out the year on a high note, Chief Executive Bob Chapek said last week. After \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" the next big-budget action movie expected is \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" from Disney-owned 20th Century Studios, a sequel to the highest-grossing movie of all time set for mid-December. </p><p>\n  Hollywood studios have been returning to theaters tentatively this year, testing the waters by releasing fewer movies, in part because of Covid-19-related production delays, but also in response to changing consumer habits. More viewers are watching movies at home on streaming video services, including Disney's Hulu and Disney+ platforms, forcing studios to produce exclusive content at a much faster pace. </p><p>\n  Marvel Studios, led by producer Kevin Feige, has established itself as one of the most dominant production houses in Hollywood since Disney acquired it in 2009. Six of the 20 highest-grossing movies of all time are Marvel productions or co-productions. The seven Marvel movies released in 2021 and 2022 have grossed a combined $2.3 billion, representing 21% of the total domestic box office for those years. </p><p>\n  Making the \"Black Panther\" sequel was complicated by challenges and tragedy. Chadwick Boseman, the star of the original movie, died in 2020 after privately battling colon cancer, forcing the movies' writer-director Ryan Coogler to overhaul the screenplay. </p><p>\n  So far in 2022, a dearth of widely released films has hobbled box office totals. Still, movies have earned nearly $6.5 billion in theaters this year, according to Comscore, a gain of 95% over 2021, when many cinemas were closed because of the pandemic. </p><p>\n  --- </p><pre>  Estimated Box-Office Figures, Through Sunday \n \n                                                                Sales, In Millions \n    Film                            Distributor           Weekend* Cumulative     % Change \n \n1.
