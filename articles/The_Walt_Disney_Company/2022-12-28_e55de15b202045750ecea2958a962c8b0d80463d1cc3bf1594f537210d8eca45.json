  "text": "<p>With Donald Glover's <em>Atlanta</em> having come to an end, another FX series, <em>Reservation Dogs</em>, is well-poised to take the mantle as TV's most original exploration of American minority identity — and its most intelligent comedy. </p> <p>The second season of Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi's coming-of-age tale about four indigenous teenagers brings us back to the rundown, rural Oklahoma town that our protagonists were so desperate to run away from in season one. And while Elora (Devery Jacobs), Bear (D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), Willie Jack (Paulina Alexis) and Cheese (Lane Factor) may still be finding their way in life, the show itself only seems to become more assured in its sophomore run as it delicately balances offbeat humour and raw emotion, spirituality and disaffection, ancient traditions and pop culture. &#xa0;</p> <p>The story picks up again days after the events of the last episode, when Elora skipped out on her friends to pursue her California dreams. Getting out of Oklahoma, however, proves to be something of a nightmare, as she escapes a kidnapping and a shooting before even reaching the state border. </p> <p>Back home, the others are more listless and disillusioned than ever, with Elora's betrayal only compounding the group's pain over the death of their friend Daniel. That these young lives have already been marked with so much disappointment and heartbreak — conveyed in mature, beautifully intuitive performances — is the undercurrent of tragedy that belies the whip-smart dialogue and surreal gags. &#xa0;</p> <p>While this season may seem a little more sombre than its predecessor, it still succeeds in packing several terrifically funny scenes into each episode. These usually involve Bear's meddlesome “spirit guide” (Dallas Goldtooth) or the oddball local elders, whose attempts to try imbue the younger generations with an appreciation of their heritage are often amusingly misguided. </p> <p>Though irreverent, <em>Reservation Dogs</em> clearly has nothing but affection for its characters, who in turn display such a wonderful familial warmth for one another. For all the deprivation it captures, the series never fails also to emphasise the richness of this tight-knit community. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>★★★★★</p> <p><em>On Disney Plus in the UK from January 4 and on Hulu in the US now</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Reservation Dogs season two review — peerless exploration of American minority identity' FT.com 28 December.
