He set a $325 price target on the stock, which implied about 33% upside from Monday's closing price.</p><p>Not only will the launch of a lower-priced ad-tier subscription plan attract some first-time subscribers, Helfstein believes there's a larger opportunity to re-engage those who have previously discontinued service.</p><p>\"Ad-tier launch should accelerate subscriber growth, drive ARPU [average revenue per user] and slow churn,\" Helfstein wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>He also believes Netflix will command high cost per thousand (CPM) from advertisers, given that it sill has the highest viewership in the industry, and as streaming continues to take share from TV.</p><p>Also read: Traditional TV 'is marching to a distinct precipice,' former Disney CEO Iger says.</p><p>\"[Netflix] attracts a significant audience for releases of marquee shows, comparable to awards shows and major sporting events, suggesting the company can sell ads at CPMs well above the normal TV average,\" Helfstein wrote. \"In addition, it could choose to release shows in conjunction with large advertisers' product launches.\"</p><p>He believes Netflix's move to crack down onpassword sharing, its partnership with Microsoft Corp.
