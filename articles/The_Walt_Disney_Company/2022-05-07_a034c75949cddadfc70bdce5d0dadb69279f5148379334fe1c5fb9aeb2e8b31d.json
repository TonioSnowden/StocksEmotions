  "title": "Maxi impact: the return of the long, luxurious skirt",
  "text": "<p>Finding fashion inspiration in a Disney cartoon isn't something I should readily admit to. But rewatching <em>Encanto</em> with my daughter for the nth time recently, I felt that the long A-line red-and-yellow skirt worn by Dolores, the cousin with superhuman hearing, was speaking to me. The film is awash with beautifully detailed long skirts inspired by traditional Colombian dress, with any number I'd love to have converted into three dimensions and added to my wardrobe this summer. </p> <p>The good news&#xa0;is that beyond Disney+ cosplay,&#xa0;long skirts have real-world cachet right now. For all the talk of the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a5a0cdc-5e8d-4542-8203-fc07b5f1ead0\">return of the Y2K-inspired mini</a>, its longer sister is as relevant. You only need look at the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef22557f-6dcb-425a-905f-0a9a27f80fac\">Oscars red carpet&#xa0;in March</a>&#xa0;to see it on elegant display: Uma Thurman in a pared-back white satin shirt and long black maxi skirt by Bottega Veneta, or Zendaya's more daring silver-sequinned floor-length skirt&#xa0;and cropped white shirt by Valentino Couture.</p> <p>For summer events, the long, luxurious skirt is infinitely useful. Not merely because it will cover&#xa0;pale or blotchily self-tanned legs, but because for all its glamour it can be a hard-working garment, made to look formal or informal depending how you style it. </p> <p>My ideal is less of a drippy-hippy to-the-floor number and more of a fabulous A-line or full, ankle-brushing style in a silky or swooshy fabric. Something that has romance, fun, colour and a sense of occasion. Maybe not even colour. In Luca Guadagnino's 2015 film <em>A Bigger Splash</em>, Tilda Swinton's Raf Simons-for-Dior swingy white silk skirt worn with a black draped bodysuit was surely the epitome of the look I'm dreaming of. </p> <p>Feeling similar long-skirt lust? Designers have you covered this season. Valentino's rainbow-coloured chevron-striped crêpe de chine skirt is a 1970s-inspired garment of joy to have in your wardrobe for ever (£1,800,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Valentino-Chevron-stripe-crepe-de-Chine-midi-skirt-1460557\">matchesfashion.com</a>), while Net-a-Porter has a good selection from New York label Khaite, including a ballet-pink long tutu style (£1,580, <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/khaite/clothing/maxi/samantha-pleated-tulle-midi-skirt/25185454455595436?\">net-a-porter.com</a>) that summons up images of Carrie Bradshaw but is inexplicably called the Samantha; a sleek, dark-gold satin <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/khaite/clothing/maxi/lise-satin-maxi-skirt/25185454455745232?\">slip skirt</a> (£540); and a pleated crêpe maxi in ivory that would look beautiful with a slouchy knit in the same colour (£860, <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/khaite/clothing/maxi/lowell-pleated-crepe-maxi-skirt/25185454455740280?cm_mmc=Google-ProductSearch-UK--c-_-NAP_INTL_EN_UK_London_PLA-_-NAP+-+INTL+-+London+-+GS+-+SSC+-+L4--INTL+-+London+-+L4_INTL&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwma6TBhDIARIsAOKuANxzHUHq-Xbe3OtBXf9VcTouB_8f36XcBKd8k4lAd3LgIDf0YjCGMr4aAjxCEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">net-a-porter.com</a>). </p> <p>Joseph's crinkly habotai silk maxi with elasticated waist returns each season in different colours. This summer's sky blue (£465,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.joseph-fashion.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Joseph-Site/en_GB/Product-Variation?pid=jf005836_0303&amp;dwvar_jf005836__0303_size=34&amp;dwvar_jf005836__0303_color=Sky+blue&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl34GiOSpq9BzkluOp917Fr0PiskU19aPC0sYMhSxVcl60u93StWIkkhoCE8kQAvD_BwE#fo_c=594&amp;fo_k=ac11d83da2f242b970c8373ab9992fee&amp;fo_s=gsuruk&amp;fo_oid=222\">joseph-fashion.com</a>) is a winner. For the popular “co-ord” look, wear it with the matching silk Briela top (£295, <a href=\"https://www.joseph-fashion.com/en-gb/habotai-briela-top-jf005837_0168.html\">joseph-fashion.com</a>) or the brand's cotton-silk knitted T-shirt in the same shade (£195, <a href=\"https://www.joseph-fashion.com/en-gb/cotton-silk-knit-top-jf005732_0745.html?dwvar_jf005732__0745_\">joseph-fashion.com</a>). You could wear this with tennis shoes or flat sandals — a Birkenstock or a thin or chunky strapped slider. (If you're concerned about fabric getting trapped between heel and sole, consider shortening the hem to the ankle.)</p> <p>I also love the graphic printed silk jacquard skirts by British label Lisou (£305, <a href=\"https://lisou.co.uk/collections/skirts\">lisou.co.uk</a>), which can be worn with another silk-print shirt for a maximalist clash or with a crisp white cotton shirt or knitted polo T-shirt tucked in. The slightly shorter A-line silhouette looks good with a low-heeled sandal or Bottega Veneta-style mules.</p> <p>If your tastes run to the more bohemian, head to La DoubleJ or Emporio Sirenuse. The latter's cotton Flaminia skirt (£565; <a href=\"https://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Emporio-Sirenuse-Flaminia-knife-pleated-printed-maxi-skirt-1471971\">matchesfashion.com</a>) is in a pink-and-red tropical toile de Jouy pattern and, for added intellectual satisfaction, has John Steinbeck's words “Positano bites deep” printed on the waistband.</p> <p>New British brand Hester Bly has a good range too, including the Jodhpur (£825, <a href=\"https://hesterbly.com/collections/tigers-of-india/products/jodphur-skirt\">hesterbly.com</a>), a full-skirted style in embroidered white cotton with gold disks on the hem, and a white broderie anglaise version (£695, <a href=\"https://hesterbly.com/collections/tigers-of-india/products/baagh-a-line-maxi-skirt-pockets\">hesterbly.com</a>) that can be worn in high summer with a matching bandeau top. </p> <p>But there's no need to buy new. As Georgina Coulter, head of buying at <a href=\"https://www.theoutnet.com/en-gb/\">The Outnet</a>, points out, these are classic styles that don't date. “The joy of building your wardrobe with these timeless pieces means that you can purchase past-season garments,” she says. A Marchesa Notte asymmetric devoré-chiffon maxi currently on sale (£184, <a href=\"https://www.theoutnet.com/en-gb/shop/product/marchesa-notte/skirts/maxi-skirts/asymmetric-floral-print-devore-chiffon-maxi-skirt/43769801098066564?gclid=Cj0KCQjwma6TBhDIARIsAOKuANwwBcAVcPLfxzEZA6r8cAfjBHPu_2c3dZ2Lb28ImVrVQgtTnX4pfeoaAjBDEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">theoutnet.com</a>) is a piece that can come out year after year — as is Ganni's classic bestselling leopard-print maxi (£70, <a href=\"https://www.theoutnet.com/en-gb/shop/product/ganni/skirts/maxi-skirts/leopard-print-plisse-georgette-maxi-skirt/42247633208713856?gclid=Cj0KCQjwma6TBhDIARIsAOKuANyXW0B3AQ6uzb-wHblOviOu-IRJU8J8yjofHmbFX6bvBxoWKGDqMW4aAunqEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">theoutnet.com</a>).</p> <p>And you can go back further. When my editor reminisced&#xa0;about a black-and-white striped 1960s Oscar de la Renta ball skirt that she used to wear to pool parties, it sent me into an online vortex of fabulous vintage skirts. On 1stdibs you can find old, rare De la Renta skirts for around £600, alongside an Emilio Pucci pink velvet handkerchief skirt (£776,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.1stdibs.com/fashion/clothing/skirts/vintage-emilio-pucci-pink-velvet-handkerchief-skirt-1970s/id-v_3532581/\">1stdibs.com</a>) and a 1990s Gianfranco Ferré coral silk ruffle maxi with a sexy split up the front (£562, <a href=\"https://www.1stdibs.com/fashion/clothing/skirts/1990s-gianfranco-ferre-coral-silk-crepe-asymmetrical-draped-ruffle-skirt/id-v_14127782/\">1stdibs.com</a>). Statement skirts with timeless allure sewn in?
