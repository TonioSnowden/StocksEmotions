  "text": "<p>Shares in Mattel jumped almost 10 per cent on Wednesday after the US toymaker behind Barbie won back the global licence to develop <em>Frozen</em> and Disney princess toys, seven years after losing it to arch-rival Hasbro. </p> <p>Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's chief executive, declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal but said it would be “accretive in and of itself”.&#xa0;The contract had been worth a reported $440m, or 7 per cent of Mattel's annual sales, before it lost the franchise in 2015. </p> <p>Sales from such franchises rise and fall with film release schedules. Jefferies analysts said that the princess business was now worth less than $250m, down from peak revenues of $565m. </p> <p>Hasbro would sustain a hit to profits of less than $20m, said Stephanie Wissink, a Jefferies analyst, but the net benefit to Mattel would be bigger given its larger presence in the dolls market.</p> <p>Kreiz said that winning back the contract had been “a key priority” since he became chief executive in 2018 after a period of declining sales and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26c3acec-440d-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd\">leadership turmoil</a> that followed the loss of one of the toy industry's most fought-over licences. </p> <p>“It's important in that it speaks to the strength and capabilities of the new Mattel,” he told the Financial Times. Mattel's work on Disney's <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Cars</em> franchises had given Disney's leadership confidence that it could “develop and grow evergreen properties”, he added.</p> <p>Kreiz, a former television executive, has overhauled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42ed82d8-f04d-4993-ae1f-588d20d50f6d\">brands such as Barbie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a09c8ce-b20b-11e8-8d14-6f049d06439c\">launched a film division</a> as Mattel seeks to revive sales and emulate the success of rivals that have repositioned themselves as entertainment groups. </p> <p>Disney will retain the entertainment rights to characters from films including <em>Frozen</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, <em>Mulan</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>, but Mattel's agreement extends from dolls to games, consumer products and publishing.</p> <p>Kreiz's restructuring of Mattel has included cutting $1bn from costs, exiting factories and slashing capital spending, but he said its supply chain was “absolutely ready” to absorb the additional volumes. </p> <p>The deal came as Hasbro announced a multiyear extension of its deal with Disney's Lucasfilm arm, under which it will continue to create <em>Star Wars</em> toys and launch a line tied to the upcoming revival of the <em>Indiana Jones</em> franchise. </p> <p>Brands from the biggest film properties were taking a growing share of the toy and consumer products industries, Kreiz noted. “In a world of unlimited supply, ubiquitous distribution and limited shelf space, big, trusted brands are more important than ever,” he said.</p> <p>Mattel shares were up 8.7 per cent in morning trading market at $21.32. Shares in Hasbro slid almost 2 per cent to $93.90.</p><p>Source: Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Mamta Badkar in New York 2022 'Mattel wins back rights to ‘Frozen' and Disney princess toys from rival Hasbro' FT.com 26 January.
