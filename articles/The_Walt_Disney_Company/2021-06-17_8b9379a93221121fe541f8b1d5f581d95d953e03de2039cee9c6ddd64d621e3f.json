  "text": "<p>A number of philosophical themes swirl around the opening couple of episodes of <em>Loki</em>, Disney Plus's new series devoted to the eponymous Norse god of mischief, as filtered through the phantasmagorical filter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, few of them are absent. There is the thorny paradox of determinism versus free will, the existential thicket concerning the nature of personal identity, the dangers of moral absolutism.</p> <p>There is even a sprinkling of that 21st-century touchstone of self-realisation, the importance of being the best possible version of yourself, although Tom Hiddleston's wryness of delivery makes clear these particular references are satirical. “Sheathe your smarm for a moment,” Loki tells another version of Loki (don't ask), his enunciation so sharp it could slice open an Infinity Stone all by itself.</p> <p>Keen viewers of the MCU will remember the Infinity Stones, a key element in the gnarled storyline of the <em>Avengers</em> movies. Well, forget about that. Here, they have been bathetically reduced in importance to acting as paperweights in the soulless offices of the Time Variance Authority, which has arrested the pesky protagonist for the understandably severe offence of crimes against the Sacred Timeline (aka changing the course of history).</p> <p>Loki spars with detective Mobius M Mobius (Owen Wilson) over a black Saarinen tulip table (lovely retro-futurism abounds), and the two of them hurtle through time and the history of moral philosophy. They bond, a little, and we are kept in a state of genuine tension: is the “mischievous scamp” malign or misunderstood?&#xa0;</p> <p>It's impossible not to admire the zest of these exchanges, nor the ambition of the MCU's startling evolution in recent years. <em>Loki </em>is the third part of phase four of the franchise's long-term unravelling of its tight-suited assets, and in many ways one of the boldest. Like its TV predecessors, <em>WandaVision</em> and (less so) <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, </em>it uses television's extended narrative arc to dig deeper into character and embrace ethical complexity.</p> <p>The opening episodes of <em>Loki</em>, directed by Britain's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/359f6390-00c3-11ea-be59-e49b2a136b8d\">Kate Herron</a>, are heavy on dialogue and exposition, however leavened by the jokes, and distinctly short on spectacular action sequences. The first movie in phase four, <em>Black Widow</em>, is released in July and will no doubt reverse those priorities. But Marvel has found a sweet spot here, using the TV series to circle, in ever more sophisticated fashion, around the themes presented in the movies, and even take on a life of their own. (It must be noted that DC Comics, which has generally struggled to match Marvel's flair with movie adaptations, has provided TV's finest comic book turn to date, namely Damon Lindelof's dazzling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14d7b77c-effa-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901\"><em>Watchmen</em></a>.)&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>In purely pragmatic terms,<em> Loki </em>looks like a safe bet for further excursions: its (anti?) hero is able to change form, skip across time, and indulge with equal intensity in crafty acts of space vandalism and bouts of earthly self-doubt. That is what you call dramatic potential. </p> <p>It is also good fun, thanks in large part to Hiddleston's larky ways with statements of the epic. “I'd like all files pertaining to the beginning of time, please,” he tells the dour librarian in the Time Variance Authority, who comes up with the most crushing line of the episode: “It's classified.” It would be.</p> <p>★★★★☆ </p> <p><em>New episodes every Wednesday on Disney Plus</em></p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Peter Aspden 2021 'Loki — Marvel's anti-hero melds mischief and moral philosophy' FT.com 17 June.
