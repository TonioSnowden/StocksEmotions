Sure, I'm keen to see if AJ can win and set up a superfight with the likes of <strong>Tyson Fury</strong> or <strong>Deontay Wilder</strong>. But my ulterior motive is to see if I can collar top executives from <strong>DAZN</strong>, the global sports streaming service, which is screening Saturday's bout in 170 countries (though not the UK) after signing a deal worth over $100m with boxing promoter, <strong>Matchroom</strong>.</p> <p>DAZN, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c0ffe51-3fee-4cd6-88ab-54401e62dada\">as reported</a> in the FT this week, are on the verge of a far bigger deal: acquiring British sports broadcaster <strong>BT Sport</strong>. How is that purchase affordable for the as-yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9052379a-78eb-4825-a0f6-f3dba6299940\">unprofitable</a> DAZN? Will a tie-up boost DAZN's plan for a future IPO? I'll be seeking answers. In the meantime, Scoreboard starts with a special dispatch on a deal that will shake up sports broadcasting. Do read on — <em>Murad Ahmed, Sports Editor</em></p> <h1>Why DAZN wants BT Sport — and why BT is abandoning sport</h1> <p><em>This dispatch is by Nic Fildes, the FT's telecoms correspondent</em></p> <p>One of the less enviable jobs of a football manager is to move on superstar players that cost a fortune that were bought by ambitious predecessors. Ideally, a rival club with deep pocketed owners emerges to get the player off the books.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>BT</strong>, the telecoms company that has spent almost a decade as Britain's high-spending challenger in the sports broadcasting market, has found itself in a similar position.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has amassed an enviable collection of sports rights — <strong>Premier League</strong>, <strong>Champions League</strong>, <strong>UFC </strong>— but it has proved more popular with fans than shareholders.&#xa0;</p> <p>The executive team that led the foray into sports are long gone. Their successors have worked hard to make the business work. BT Sport was costing the company around £400m a year. After raising prices and lowering costs it is now breaking even.</p> <p>BT is estimated to have racked up £2bn in operating losses on its aggressive sports foray but it is important to remember that it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0cc22bf-0c73-4c55-a35a-1459181833c1\">playing defence</a> as well. Rival <strong>Sky</strong>, now owned by US media giant <strong>Comcast</strong>, was offering free broadband to its sports subscribers a decade ago and eating into BT's market share.&#xa0;</p> <p>BT fought back on Sky's turf and arguably breathed life into its somewhat staid image in the process.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet broadcasting sport is a distraction for a telecoms company now focused on fibre and 5G upgrades. It kicked off a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6d30613-af0f-4720-b1bb-c8941bca10c0\">sale process</a> six months ago and DAZN, the ambitious streaming company backed by billionaire <strong>Sir Leonard Blavatnik</strong>, is now in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c0ffe51-3fee-4cd6-88ab-54401e62dada\">advanced talks</a> with the telecoms company to strike a deal.</p> <p>DAZN, chaired by former <strong>Disney</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c35fc9fb-6466-43f0-8ad6-ddf6c1cc7d79\"><strong>TikTok</strong></a> boss <strong>Kevin Mayer</strong>, has made no secret of its desire for Premier League rights nor its admiration of BT Sport.</p> <p>DAZN will need to cover the cost of running BT Sport, estimated at between £800m and £1bn a year, while growing the subscriber base beyond where BT could take it.</p> <p>BT could also cut a deal with DAZN to continue to offer its subscribers access to the sports channels to avoid an exodus. <strong>Vodafone Spain</strong> learnt to its cost that backing out of football can result in mass customer walkout. In 2018 it lost 100,000 users in the space of six months after it stopped showing La Liga.&#xa0;</p> <p>Like any good transfer saga, getting the deal over the line is complicated. Sky could still make a last-ditch tackle to stop DAZN in its tracks. Sky has a cross-licensing deal with BT and could potentially refuse to play ball. It's not a “done deal” yet.</p> <h1>Buyer beware: who profits from sports “NFTs”</h1> <p>Can the sale of virtual sports items make real-world gains? Some of the world's biggest technology investors certainly think so.</p> <p>This week, Japan's <strong>SoftBank</strong> led a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b247322-fc83-4e7b-bd03-c66eaf1dc762\">$680m investment</a> into French start up <strong>Sorare</strong> (pronounced “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3db2b2a9-1d19-4928-91e0-d2e48c635482\">So Rare</a>”). The three-year-old company runs a fantasy football game which also allows players to buy and trade digital football cards, known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p> <p>NFTs are secured on the blockchain, just like cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. That means each card is unique to the owner, giving players an incentive to collect and trade.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Julia</strong>, chief executive and co-founder of Sorare, told the Financial Times it has made digital card sales worth $150m this year alone. Those revenues have drawn the interest of many of the world's top technology investors.</p> <p>Sorare's latest fundraising was backed by <strong>Atomico</strong>, <strong>Bessemer Ventures</strong>, <strong>D1 Capital</strong>, <strong>Eurazeo</strong>, <strong>Hillhouse</strong>, <strong>IVP</strong> and <strong>LionTree. </strong>Star footballers like <strong>Gerard Piqué</strong>, <strong>Antoine Griezmann</strong>, <strong>Rio Ferdinand</strong> and <strong>César Azpilicueta</strong> also participated in the round. They joined existing investors <strong>Benchmark</strong>, <strong>Accel</strong> and <strong>Headline</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Their collective wager is that trading of Sorare's cards will continue well into the future, just like <strong>Topps </strong>baseball cards and <strong>Panini </strong>football stickers have been bought and sold for decades.</p> <p>But hold up. Are NFTs just a passing craze?&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ef91ab2-4a9d-4e67-a7a2-2136f174a8b7\">Take the experience</a> of the <strong>National Basketball Association </strong>and its offering called “<strong>Top Shot</strong>” ⁠ — 12-second highlights encrypted on the blockchain and then sold to fans as digital cards.</p> <p>During its <a href=\"https://cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot/sales/summary\">February peak</a>, more than 80,000 buyers spent $224m to acquire the basketball cards that month. In July, there were just 35 buyers generating sales worth $8.4m.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sorare cards achieved <a href=\"https://cryptoslam.io/sorare/sales/summary\">their peak</a> in March, when they were worth $281 on average compared to $168.92 this month. But the number of transactions has also steadily increased over the year, suggesting there is keener interest in Sorare cards than Top Shot's.</p> <p>Sorare's Julia insists his company will never market its NFT cards as an investment product, emphasising that the reason to join is to play its fantasy football game.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company's new deep-pocketed investors can absorb any losses if Sorare can't maintain interest buying its cards. That's the nature of venture capital. Most start ups fail. Investors hope to make a big return on one or two companies that survive and thrive.</p> <p>The fear is that sports fans buying up NFTs are not as clear-eyed on the risks of losing their money.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>Emma Raducanu</strong> bandwagon rolls on. The organisers of the <strong>Wimbledon</strong> tennis Championships <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8ed3170-95ec-400f-b63e-c45a6900b7fb\">announced the sale</a> of 1,250 debentures — guaranteed seats for wealthy fans — for No 1 Court at £46,000 each, up from £31,000 previously. One of the reasons they think there is plenty of demand for the pricey tickets is the emergence of Raducanu, the British 18-year-old who sensationally won the <strong>US Open</strong> earlier this month.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>DraftKings</strong>, the fantasy sports and betting company, has made an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/613a232a-5a77-4e58-a3b2-4a3af69af88f\">£18.4bn offer</a> for <strong>Entain</strong>, setting the stage for a battle with the UK gambling group's joint venture partner in the US, the casino giant <strong>MGM</strong>. The FT has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16bce172-3713-4771-ac3e-50e6600a6c5f\">profiled</a> DraftKings chief executive <strong>Jason Robins</strong>, the man attempting to pull off a huge deal in an effort to dominate the emerging American sports betting industry.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Uefa </strong>doubled down on its criticisms of moves to hold a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/268989a1-5299-473e-adc4-ed02d247cd3c\">biennial World Cup</a>. European football's governing body said moving away from the existing four-yearly cycle would lead to player burnout and swallow attention from women's football tournaments. The objections set the stage for a battle with <strong>Fifa</strong>, the global governing body, which wants to hold the game's premier national team competition more frequently.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>The Athletic</strong>, online sport journalism start up, has hired investment bank LionTree to <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-athletic-hires-liontree-to-find-buyer-at-price-of-more-than-750-million?utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_content=article-6298\">seek a buyer at a price</a> of more than $750m, according to <em>The Information</em>. That move comes after unsuccessful sale talks with both <strong>Axios</strong> and the <strong>New York Times</strong> in recent months.</p></li>  <li><p>The body that runs English cricket called off an upcoming tour of Pakistan due to issues around player welfare. <strong>Ramiz Raja</strong>, chair of the <strong>Pakistan Cricket Board</strong>, said the decision made his country feel “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/21/pakistan-feels-used-and-binned-by-englands-withdawal\">used and binned</a>”. England's move came after New Zealand abruptly cancelled a tour to the Asian country citing security concerns.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Derby County</strong>, the club that plays in the <strong>Championship</strong>, the second tier of English football, fell into administration. Owner <strong>Mel Morris</strong>, who had sought to spend on players to reach the Premier League, said he lost “in excess of £200m” over his time at the club. Administrators <strong>Quantuma</strong> are looking for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58665019\">short term funding</a> to secure Derby's immediate future.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <p>We can't get enough of <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong>, the <strong>Miami Heat</strong> basketball player whose gregarious yet competitive personality has made him a star. We enjoyed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/espnf1/status/1439257986556366849\">this clip</a> of Butler freaking out as a passenger of a race car driven at top speed by <strong>Formula One</strong>'s <strong>Lando Norris</strong>.
