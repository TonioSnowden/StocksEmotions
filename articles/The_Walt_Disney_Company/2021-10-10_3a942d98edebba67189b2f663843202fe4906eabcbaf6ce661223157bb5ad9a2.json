  "text": "<p>The capybaras living in Nordelta can reach 140 pounds. Picture a guinea pig the size of a St. Bernard with chompers like a beaver, an insatiable herbivore appetite and XXL-size droppings. They roam about in record numbers, munching on manicured lawns and scuffling with family pets. In August, a security camera caught a food-delivery worker getting knocked off his motorcycle after colliding with a capybara in a dark intersection.</p><p>The furry, water-loving creatures were there first—Nordelta was built on their wetland habitat—prompting awkward efforts at detente with the colossal rodents. Neighbors are split, viewing them as either vermin or victim.</p><p>\"I'm not anti-capybara; I want to scratch their cute little bellies as much as anyone else,\" said Gustavo Iglesias, a 62-year-old real-estate broker and longtime resident. \"The problem is that their population is out of control, and people are too scared to do anything. No one wants to look like they're opposed to nature.\"</p><p>Mr. Iglesias's lakeside garden gets a daily serving of jumbo scat dumped by the two dozen or so capybaras that lounge in his yard, he said. That was bad, but the last straw was when his dog Lucho limped home with a bloody pair of deep gashes that looked like the handiwork of rodent incisors. </p><p>Dog walkers pass grazing capybaras in the Nordelta community in Argentina.

Their appearance—broad snout, round body—and generally laid-back temperament make them a favorite of visitors to national parks. A capybara family is featured in \"Encanto,\" an animated Walt Disney Co. movie that takes place in Colombia and debuts next month. They also star as a grilled delicacy in rural parts of South America.</p><p>The big rodents, which typically live in family units of as many as 40 animals, go by different names in various countries: chigüire in Venezuela, ronsoco in Peru, poncho in Panama and carpincho in Argentina. Females can give birth to half a dozen offspring a year.</p><p>The capybaras seem to enjoy the good life in Nordelta. They sunbathe and graze at man-made lagoons, protected from such natural predators as jaguars and caimans, the South American alligator.</p><p>Residents who find the capybaras a nuisance aren't sure what they can do. Hunting the rodents requires approval from environmental regulators.</p><p>Dueling WhatsApp chat groups have formed in recent months—one pro-capybara, one against. </p><p>Capybaras, the world biggest rodent, have grown to record numbers in Argentina's exclusive gated community of Nordelta. PHOTO: Silvina Frydlewsky for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>In July, Anamá Ferreira, a Brazilian model living in Nordelta, posted a photo on Twitter of a bloodied capybara she said was hit with buckshot by a neighbor. Another resident posted photos of a capybara run over by a van.</p><p>Nordelta's man-versus-nature saga is drawing national attention. Environmentalists tied to Argentina's leftist government want the capybaras left undisturbed by the community's affluent members.</p><p>\"I was outraged by the Nordelta residents complaining,\" said Adrián Mazza, a 47-year-old tour guide at a national park. \"It's the humans that invaded the capybara's territory.\"</p><p>Others said the rodents should be relocated, citing traffic accidents and the damage from capybaras chewing up lawns and palm trees. \"We can't have a wild animal living here, running around main streets,\" said a 47-year-old teacher named Romina, who declined to give her last name.</p><p>Biologist and conservationist Talía Zamboni said she has seen few issues as polarizing: \"These things always get divided between right and left, the rich and the poor, and here we have these little animals caught in between.\"</p><p>Some environmentalists have cited the capybaras in Nordelta in urging lawmakers to advance long-delayed legislation barring development in Argentina's wetlands. </p><p>Capybaras had long inhabited wetlands where the gated community of Nordelta was built. PHOTO: Silvina Frydlewsky for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Nordelta was built on the outskirts of the Paraná River Delta, north of Buenos Aires, after breaking ground in 1999. It was marketed as a safe, American-style haven for moneyed Argentines, including full-time residents. A slogan on Nordelta's website promises \"the tranquility of nature and the comfort of the city.\"</p><p>The whopper rodents are testing how much nature residents really want. Mr. Iglesias said that after his dog was attacked two years ago, he spoke out about controlling the capybara population. His 36-year-old daughter, who also lives in Nordelta, opposed him.</p><p>\"She thought I wanted to kill the capybaras!\" he said. \"On the contrary. I love living with them, as long as there's a balance.\"</p><p>Nordelta developer Eduardo Costantini recently sought reassure Argentines in radio interviews that there were no plans to kill the animals. He also urged residents to find a way to live in harmony with the big rodents.</p><p>\"The capybaras are defenseless and lovely beings that need care and love from us all,\" Mr. Costantini wrote in a recent Instagram post. He declined to comment. </p><p>Marcelo Canton, who runs Nordelta's residents' association, explains how neighbors on lakeside properties have had to coexist with increasing numbers of capybaras. PHOTO: Silvina Frydlewsky for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The capybaras live mostly around premium waterfront properties, which make up about 15% of the 3,000 properties in Nordelta, according to residents. On a recent day, cyclists and runners swerved around capybaras blocking a park path while the animals chowed on grass.</p><p>Retired journalist Marcelo Canton, spokesman for a local neighbors association, said his group has proposed various plans to government regulators. One is to create a 500-acre reserve for capybaras in Nordelta. Another idea: Castrate males.</p><p>Getting heard by state wildlife officials has been impossible during the pandemic, Mr. Canton said. Meantime, the association put up road signs urging motorists and cyclists to watch for capybaras.</p><p>\"It was very painful to see people accuse us of mistreating the capybaras, because we have a great amount of respect for them here,\" Mr. Canton said, joined by a few of them as he spoke. \"We invest a lot of money into making sure they're safe.\"</p><p>Write to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com</p><p>Rodents the Size of St. Bernards Swarm an Exclusive Gated Community</p>",
