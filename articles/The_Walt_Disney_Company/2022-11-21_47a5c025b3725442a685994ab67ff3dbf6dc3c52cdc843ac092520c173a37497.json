  "text": "<p>\"We thank Bob Chapek for his service to Disney over his long career, including navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic,\" she added.</p><p>The change comes at a tumultuous time for Disney.</p><p>Last month, the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth quarter financial results, killing the momentum built up over a strong year that saw record revenue and profits in multiple divisions, especially the one that includes theme parks. Disney's theme park business has recovered strongly since the coronavirus pandemic shut down its venues across the world, but the division continues to subsidize widening losses in the streaming video business. </p><p>Bob Chapek in Laguna Beach, Calif., earlier this year. PHOTO: Nikki Ritcher for the Wall Street Journal</p><p>Mr. Chapek has said repeatedly that he expects the streaming business to be profitable by September 2024. In the most recent quarter, though, it lost $1.47 billion, more than twice the year-earlier loss. The company also cautioned that its profitability target would only be met if there wasn't a significant economic downturn.</p><p>In August, activist investor Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC said it had taken a stake in Disney stock after having liquidated its position earlier this year. Mr. Loeb sent a letter to Mr. Chapek asking for major changes to the business. He called for Disney to spin off ESPN, refresh its board and cut spending, though a month later he backed off on the demand to change control of the sports channel.</p><p>In response to Mr. Loeb's suggestions, the company appointed Carolyn Everson, a veteran digital advertising executive, to its board, and agreed to a standstill with Third Point.</p><p>In an email to employees Sunday night, Mr. Iger said he was returning to the company.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Walt Disney Names Robert Iger CEO, Replacing Bob Chapek</p>",
