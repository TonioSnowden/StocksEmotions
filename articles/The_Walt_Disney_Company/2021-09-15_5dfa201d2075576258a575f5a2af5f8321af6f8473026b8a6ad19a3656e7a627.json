  "title": "Most Americans say the public health benefits of COVID-19 restrictions ‘have been worth the costs'",
  "text": "<p>Still, Americans think those restrictions were worth it, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. It found that while a majority of Americans believe that coronavirus restrictions have hurt businesses and economic activity, they've been worth it in the end.</p><p>The survey, which polled more than 10,000 U.S. adults, found that 69% believe that COVID-19 restrictions on activity have hurt businesses and economic activity “a lot,” while 26% believe they've hurt businesses “some.” And 89% of Americans believe restrictions have “kept people from living their lives the way they want” either a lot or some.</p><p>But 73% of those polled said that the restrictions have helped prevent COVID-19-caused hospitalizations and deaths either a lot or some, and 72% said the restrictions helped to slow the spread of coronavirus.</p><p>Related: Gen Z students overwhelmingly support strict COVID-19 policies as they return to school</p><p>Overall, 62% of Americans said the public health benefits of COVID restrictions “have been worth the costs.”</p><p>As COVID-19 cases continue to surge across the country due to the delta variant, some local governments have reinstated different COVID-19 restrictions. Los Angeles County brought back its mask mandate in July, and New York City started&#xa0;requiring all patrons to prove vaccination&#xa0;in order to visit indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, public performances, museums and other venues.&#xa0;The U.S. is currently averaging 152,177 new cases a day, 99,275 hospitalizations and 1,888 deaths,&#xa0;according to a New York Times tracker.</p><p>As of Wednesday, 74% of the eligible U.S. population had received at least one shot of one of the three available coronavirus vaccines, according to a CDC tracker.</p><p>The survey — which was conducted from Aug. 23-Aug. 29, before President Joe Biden announced his vaccine mandate — also found that Americans often have conflicting views when it comes to vaccines.</p><p>Overall, 51% said the phrase “there's too much pressure on Americans to get a COVID-19 vaccine” describes their views somewhat or very well.</p><p>Before Biden announced his vaccine mandate — which will require businesses with 100 or more workers to ensure their employees are vaccinated, or show a negative test result weekly or more frequently — employers were already imposing vaccine mandates.</p><p>That includes some large businesses like Disney DIS,&#xa0;Facebook FB&#xa0;and Google GOOG. Delta Air Lines DAL also said its employees would face a $200 monthly health insurance surcharge if they remained unvaccinated.</p><p>Related: Biden meets with execs from Disney, Microsoft, Walgreens on vaccine mandates</p><p>At the same time, 73% of those surveyed said the statement “vaccines are the best way to protect Americans from COVID-19” describes their views somewhat or very well.</p><p>Still, roughly a quarter of the adult U.S. population has not received the vaccine at all. Experts are now predicting that 85% or 90% of the population will have to be immune to the virus in order to achieve herd immunity. And Dr. Anthony Fauci said the U.S. could see another 100,000 COVID-19 deaths before Dec. 1, mostly among people who continue to refuse vaccination.</p>",
