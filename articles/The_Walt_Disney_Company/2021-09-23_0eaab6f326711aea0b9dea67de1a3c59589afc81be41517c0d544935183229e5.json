  "text": "<p>If so, it was a bald exercise of power the old Hollywood moguls would have understood. Mr. Eyman's tale begins with the Fox Film Corp., which displayed the name of one man over the doors and the movies. William Fox, born Wilhelm Fuchs in Hungary in 1879, was brought to the U.S. as an infant, grew up on New York's Lower East Side, and founded the studio as his claim to the American dream. Fox dreamed of money and power, and not much else, yet for a time his was the most technically innovative and artistically daring studio in Hollywood. It was William Fox who invited the German director F.W. Murnau to California to make \"Sunrise,\" one of the greatest of all silent movies; and it was Fox who invested in the talent of John Ford, and gave creative freedom to gifted directors like Frank Borzage and Raoul Walsh.</p><p>When Fox's control crumbled with the advent of the Great Depression, the personality that eventually took the reins was as imperial and ambitious as his own—Darryl F. Zanuck, who dominates this book as he did his company. Zanuck shook off the dust of his native Wahoo, Neb., as fast as possible, landing in the late 1920s at Warner Bros., where his touch with their gangster pictures and gritty pre-Code output made his name. Mr. Eyman gives Zanuck much credit for the famed Warner musicals such as \"42nd Street\" and \"Gold Diggers of 1933,\" which melded \"the urban desperation of the Warner street films with the musical.\" Annoyed by his low salary, Zanuck left Warner to form 20th Century Pictures with Joseph Schenck, where in two short years he turned out multiple hits. In 1935 his studio bought out the now-bankrupt Fox, and 20th Century-Fox was born.</p><p>Mr. Eyman is particularly good at balancing the extremes of the Zanuck temperament. He was a brilliant storyteller with an ability to spot the precise page or even the line where a script dragged; \"a Geiger counter in his head,\" was how one colleague described it. Yet Zanuck was no writer himself: \"He could hardly spell cat,\" remarked one screenwriter. Notoriously short-tempered and coarse, the producer was also an inspirational leader. \"By the time Zanuck finished outlining a routine programmer, it sounded as if it was Ben-Hur,\" writes Mr. Eyman. Zanuck had no deep love for musicals, yet Fox was the home of Alice Faye and Betty Grable, and cranked out their Technicolor vehicles by the yard. Neither was Zanuck of an activist bent, yet his tenure at Fox included John Ford's magisterial \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and the anti-Semitism exposé \"Gentleman's Agreement.\" The menace of television saw Zanuck pushing for the introduction of CinemaScope—though William Fox's earlier widescreen effort \"The Big Trail\" had flopped.</p><p>Admired for his genius and loathed for his egotistical and at times vindictive style, Zanuck supplies no shortage of anecdotes. By far his most unsavory conduct was his treatment of young actresses, which went well beyond the so-called casting couch. In that era it was grudgingly treated as a fact of life, but that didn't mean the boss's behavior wasn't resented, or that the women who worked at Fox didn't find ways to help each other. (Actress Patricia Morison made a point of advising newcomers to tell Zanuck they were having their period.)</p><p>Ironically, this voracious sexual predator was himself brought low at least in part by his obsession with a series of mostly French mistresses, casting them in overpriced flops and giving his investors the jitters. He withdrew for a time to Europe, but the financial calamity of \"Cleopatra\" in 1963 caused Zanuck to come roaring back to the company he'd made. The Darryl Zanuck era came to an Oedipal close in 1971 after he moved to oust his famed producer son, Richard—and the long-suffering wife Darryl had never divorced used her shares to save her son and remove her husband.</p><p>The latter part of the studio's history is swiftly dealt with and isn't as interesting, though not due to the movies themselves—the Fox of the post-Darryl Zanuck era produced \"Star Wars,\" \"Die Hard\" and \"Titanic.\" Rather, it's because producers like Alan Ladd Jr. and even Richard Zanuck don't offer the rampaging drama of the old man. That may have made each less of an ordeal to work for, but none provided such narrative gifts to the historian.</p><p>All this is a lot to cover in under 300 pages—Vanda Krefft's 2017 biography of William Fox, who led the studio only until 1930, ran to nearly 1,000. Certain periods, like Fox's wonderful run of early talkies before Zanuck took over, get short shrift. But Mr. Eyman is aided immensely by his gift for pithy observation and his ability to draw a portrait with a few deft strokes. What made the 20th Century-Fox movies of the Golden Age special, he writes, was \"their dramatic clarity,\" and that \"derived entirely from the clear line of power\" generated by one Darryl F. Zanuck.</p><p>Ms. Nehme's writing appears in Film Comment, Sight &amp; Sound and elsewhere. She is the author of the novel \"Missing Reels.\"</p><p>'20th Century-Fox' Review: Big Screen, Bigger Ego</p>",
