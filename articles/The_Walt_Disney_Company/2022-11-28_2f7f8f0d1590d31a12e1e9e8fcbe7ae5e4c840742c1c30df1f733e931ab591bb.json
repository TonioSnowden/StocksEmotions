U.S. regulators and prosecutors also are investigating the firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, which was once valued at $32 billion but collapsed in days during the recent cryptocurrency market meltdown.</p><p>Echoing recent remarks by Prime Minister Philip Davis, Pinder said the company's implosion was caused by bad behavior involving more than 100 related entities all over the world, not lax oversight by local regulators where FTX was based. \"Any attempt to lay the entirety of this debacle at the feet of the Bahamas, because FTX is headquartered here, would be a gross oversimplification of reality,\" he said.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Employers rethink need for college degrees in tight labor market.</p><p>The Disney CFO who raised concerns about Bob Chapek has respect on the Street.</p><p>Attorney general of Bahamas deflects blame for FTX's collapse</p>",
