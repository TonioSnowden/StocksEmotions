  "title": "Stocks Move Higher After Federal Reserve Statement; Investors parse earnings from more big-name companies; Nasdaq, tech stocks rise",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have been whipsawed in recent days by expectations that the Fed will embark on a series of rate increases this year to temper heightened inflation. The prospect of a shrinking balance sheet and higher rates has prompted some to sell risky assets, including shares of technology companies that promise future returns, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Economists have expected the Fed to indicate in its statement that it is ready to start raising rates in March. Traders in interest-rate futures markets are betting that the Fed will increase rates four or five times this year, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"It's definitely a wild start to the year,\" said Josh Chastant, a senior investment analyst at GuideStone Capital Management. \"That's to be expected when you go from a stimulative Fed to less accommodative.\"</p><p>The advance in markets comes after a rough January. All three major indexes were down year-to-date as of Tuesday's close, with the Nasdaq declining 13%.</p><p>Tech stocks lifted markets Wednesday, with the S&amp;P's tech sector recently up 3%. Microsoft shares rose 4.8% after the software giant said its earnings continued to grow as its cloud-services business stayed strong. Semiconductors also advanced: Nvidia rose 5.7%, Micron Technology added 3.7% and AMD gained 3.6%.</p><p>Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said investors should consider stocks in economically sensitive sectors, rather than tech stocks, which can be less attractive during times of rising interest rates.</p><p>\"It's premature to say, 'OK, that flush was it, and now we just get back into the bull market steaming ahead,'\" Mr. Luschini said.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine that have drawn the focus of NATO allies. Geopolitical turbulence has buoyed oil in recent days, pushing it to the highest levels since 2014.</p><p>The VIX, a measure of expected volatility that is sometimes dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge, ticked down 2.72 points to 28.44. The gauge has climbed this week as stock markets fell.</p><p>Shares of Mattel gained 8.1% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it won the license to produce toys based on Walt Disney's princess lineup, and from the \"Frozen\" franchise.</p><p>Earnings season continues, with Tesla and Intel slated to report after markets close. Tesla shares added 4.1%.</p><p>In other stocks, shares of Texas Instruments gained 4.1% after the company reported higher revenue. AT&amp;T shares fell 7.8% after the company swung to a profit as it improved its wireless revenue and shed the burden of its customer-losing pay-TV business in 2021.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded at 1.781% Wednesday from 1.784% Tuesday. Yields move inversely to prices.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, added 2% to $88.96 a barrel. Supply questions have helped push prices higher.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.7%, with the biggest gains in the travel and leisure sector. Stock indexes in Asia closed mixed. China's Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi each declined 0.4%.</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value rose 3.1% from its 5 p.m. ET level Tuesday to $37,749. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value has recently sagged alongside broader markets, shedding nearly half its value from its November peak.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Move Higher After Federal Reserve Statement</p>",
