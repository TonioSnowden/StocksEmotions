  "title": "Local Sports Reporter Goes Viral for Grumpy Weather Report; Mark Woodley shoots to internet fame after several celebrities retweeted his snarky segments",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Woodley shot to internet fame after he posted a 91-second clip on Twitter of himself grumpily delivering the weather report in the wee hours of the morning. \"Can I go back to my regular job?\" he asked on air.</p><p>The video garnered more than 5 million views in a day. Several celebrities retweeted it, including comedian and filmmaker Judd Apatow. Mr. Woodley said his three children are finally giddy their dad is famous, even though he has been on TV their entire lives.</p><p>\"I thought maybe someday in my life I'd be known for something,\" said the 46-year-old, \"but crotchety old complaining weather reporter was never on the list.\"</p><p>Mr. Woodley, who works for NBC affiliate KWWL in Waterloo, found out Tuesday he had to cover Thursday's weather due to short staffing. He didn't know it was for the morning show until the day before.</p><p>He woke up at 2:45 a.m. Thursday, getting about three hours of sleep. \"I was incredibly tired,\" said Mr. Woodley, partly blaming his lack of shut-eye for his on-air crankiness.</p><p>\"I didn't even realize there was a 3:30 also in the morning until today,\" he said on the air.</p><p>Mr. Woodley shot his segments 30 feet outside the station's studio, keeping warm in the foyer when he wasn't filming. \"I'd go outside for six minutes, then I'd go inside for 10 and come back out for six,\" he said. \"That was my life for 3½ hours.\"</p><p>He was also his own cameraman. The wires froze by the end of his shift. It took a half-hour to thaw inside. Afterward, he edited the video of himself and posted it to his personal Facebook account. Friends and family convinced him to post it on Twitter.</p><p>The post quickly got attention.</p><p>\"Olaf from 'Frozen' is retweeting me,\" he said about a retweet from actor Josh Gad, who voiced the Disney animated snowman.</p><p>Mr. Apatow, who produced \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" didn't just retweet the video. He included one word: \"Legend.\" Mr. Woodley's response? \"It was so bizarre, so amazing and so surreal all at once.\"</p><p>He had to apologize to his sister for ignoring her call Friday morning—TMZ, the gossip site that normally covers celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, was on the phone asking for an interview.</p><p>Mr. Woodley wanted to make one thing clear: He doesn't think the storm is a joke. The edited clip only showed the grumpiest parts of his reports. Mr. Woodley said he was serious throughout most of his segments.</p><p>\"Basically what you saw was a movie trailer of a bad comedy, where they put all the funny stuff in the trailer,\" he said, \"and none of the rest of it was funny.\"</p><p>News executives at KWWL didn't respond to requests for comment Friday. The news station's website had a story on the rant, noting that \"no Woodley's were harmed in the making of the morning newscast.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think of the sports journalist's grumpy weather report? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Woodley acknowledges that Iowa isn't exactly known for its balmy weather. But he said the temperature that morning—around -5 degrees Fahrenheit, plus wind chills of -40 degrees—was bad even for the lifelong Iowan.</p><p>Storm coverage is boring, he said. \"I figure if I could bring a little personality to it maybe people will pay a little more attention,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Woodley hasn't been asked back to be a weatherman yet. But he's looking forward to his next assignment, a trip to Nashville, Tenn., to cover the Iowa Hawkeyes as they play in the TransPerfect Music City Bowl on New Year's Eve.</p><p>\"Somebody told me it's going to be almost 65 there,\" he said about the weather. \"I'm really excited about that.\"</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Local Sports Reporter Goes Viral for Grumpy Weather Report</p>",
