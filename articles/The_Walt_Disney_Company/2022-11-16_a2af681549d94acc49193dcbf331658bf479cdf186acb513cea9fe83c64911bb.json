  "title": "Disney World Announces Another Round of Price Increases; Entry to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood Studios in Florida will cost as much as $189 a day",
  "text": "<p>Prices will rise at the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood Studios. The most expensive one-day tickets on offer will cost $189 for a visit to the Magic Kingdom for the nine days around the Christmas and New Year's holidays, up from around $159 this year.</p><p>At Disney's Animal Kingdom park, the cost of one-day admission will stay the same, ranging from $109 to $159. The pricing of multiday tickets for Walt Disney World will also change on Dec. 8, though Disney didn't share details.</p><p>\"We continue to focus on providing guests with the best, most memorable Disney experience, and we're doing that by growing our theme parks with incredible new attractions and offerings,\" a Disney spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the company continues \"to provide a wide range of options to visit throughout the year, including our lowest-priced ticket of $109, which has not changed in more than four years.\"</p><p>Starting in December, the cost to add the Park Hopper option to one-day tickets will also begin varying by day. This add-on allows visitors to go to multiple parks in a single day. It currently costs an extra $65 per person. Disney hasn't disclosed the new pricing.</p><p>Disney announced the latest price hikes about a month after it raised the cost of its Genie+ service at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort. The Genie+ service allows visitors to Disney's parks to skip the often-long standby waits for popular attractions. Disney also increased the cost of some tickets at Disneyland in October.</p><p>These price hikes have buoyed the earnings from Disney's parks, experiences and products division, helping the company to reach record profits in recent years. The changes also come as Disney has added new attractions to its parks. In recent years, rides based on films like \"Star Wars,\" \"Ratatouille\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" have opened at Walt Disney World, and next year a new roller coaster based on the Tron franchise will make its debut at Walt Disney World.</p><p>Walt Disney World announced price increases ranging from $43 to $100 for multiple tiers of its annual pass program. The most expensive annual pass, called the Incredi-Pass, will cost $1,399 instead of $1,299. Disney halted new sales of most tiers of its annual passes last year and has yet to resume them, though existing passholders can renew their passes at a discount.</p><p>Disney has also released pricing for its discounted multiday tickets for U.S. military members and their families and friends. A five-day ticket package, including the Park Hopper option, will cost $369 plus tax per person for 2023, an increase of $20 from this year. The four-day ticket package with the Park Hopper option also rose in price by that amount, to $349 plus tax per person.</p><p>Next year, there will be additional blackout dates when discounted military tickets can't be used. These include popular spring break dates in April, plus the days around the Thanksgiving holiday. Next year, as with this year, military tickets won't be available for use around Christmas and New Year's.</p><p>These discounted tickets are available only to active or retired members of the U.S. military, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>In another change, Disney will automatically grant a park reservation to those who purchase single-day, single-park admission when the new changes go into effect. People who currently buy one-day tickets must separately make a park reservation to be granted entry.</p><p>Write to Jacob Passy at jacob.passy@wsj.com</p><p>Disney World Announces Another Round of Price Increases</p>",
