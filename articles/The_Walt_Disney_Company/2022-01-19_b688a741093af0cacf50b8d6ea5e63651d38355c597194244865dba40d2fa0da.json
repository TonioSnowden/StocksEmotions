  "title": "What to Watch: 'Billions' Returns and Five More Series to Stream This Week; Showtime's hit show is back without Damian Lewis, Stanley Tucci is a treasure hunter in 'La Fortuna,' and Hilary Duff stars in 'How I Met Your Father'",
  "text": "<p>(Showtime)</p><p>Season six is a turning point for Showtime's \"Billions,\" the hit series set in the world of high finance. The new season is the first that doesn't star Damian Lewis as hedge-fund manager Bobby Axelrod, the primary nemesis to Chuck Rhoades, attorney general of New York, played by Paul Giamatti. Rhoades's sparring partner in season six is Corey Stoll's Michael Prince, now at the helm of Axelrod's old firm.</p><p>There is still plenty to recognize in the show that mashes up finance with food, New York and rock 'n' roll. In true \"Billions\" fashion, the opening minutes of the new season's first episode include a large helping of classic rock (Buffalo Springfield's \"For What It's Worth\"), a cameo that nods to New York's food scene and an appearance from a beloved pop-cultural figure portraying an entitled billionaire: Michael McKean of \"This Is Spinal Tap\" fame, accompanied by Revolutionary War-era cannons.</p><p>Fans of the series have a tendency to see \"Billions\" outside the TV series. When Reddit's army of retail traders sent GameStop's stock price soaring, the Twitter accounts of \"Billions\" co-creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien were flooded with viewers wondering (and insisting) if the ordeal would inspire future episodes of the series.</p><p>Whether a GameStop-like plotline will make its way into the season, however, has yet to be seen. But Mr. Koppelman says they appreciate the thought.</p><p>\"It's rewarding that when people see things in the culture, they go, 'Oh, it's a 'Billions' episode come to life,' \" he says.</p><p>Season six of \"Billions\" premieres Sunday on Showtime and the Showtime app.</p><p>New Release: 'La Fortuna'</p><p>(AMC+)</p><p>In \"La Fortuna,\" a modern-day treasure hunter and his publicly traded expedition company find gold coins worth millions of dollars. The real questions are: Whose coins are they? Were they found on the bottom of the ocean in a place where the treasure hunter was permitted to look? Or, were they found among the remains of a legendary ship that was laid to rest on its way to Spain in the 19th century, which the country lays claim to? In other words: Is this finders keepers, or coins stolen from the wreckage of the ship, La Fortuna?</p><p>The series premieres Thursday on the AMC+ streaming service. It stars Stanley Tucci as fortune hunter Frank Wild. Álvaro Mel and Ana Polvorosa star as a diplomat and civil servant, respectively, who try to claim the treasure for Spain. Clarke Peters plays Jonas Pierce, an American lawyer—and Wild's onetime friend—on board to help them.</p><p>The show drops as Mr. Tucci, 61, finds his career on an upswing. He hosts an Emmy-winning series for CNN (\"Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy,\" streaming on HBO Max), has projects in the works for the BBC, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and recently worked on a forthcoming Whitney Houston biopic. Plus, his father keeps reminding him that his memoir, \"Taste,\" has been a bestseller for months. Mr. Tucci says playing Frank Wild on \"La Fortuna\" is the kind of role and project that he wouldn't have been able to make happen 15 or 20 years ago.</p><p>\"Having me attached to certain projects seems to help the project,\" he said in a recent interview. \"After 40 years in show business, that's nice.\"</p><p>'How I Met Your Father'</p><p>(Hulu)</p><p>When Hilary Duff was approached about taking the lead role of Sophie in the comedy \"How I Met Your Father,\" she felt it was the right kind of work for her, but the wrong situation for her family. The show is about a group of friends navigating Tinder and New York, and the creators wanted to shoot the show on location. But Ms. Duff, a mother of three based in L.A., said she wasn't interested in a cross-country commute.</p><p>\"They were, like: 'Great, great, great, we'll make it work in L.A.,' \" she said in a recent Zoom call. \"And I was, like, yes!\"</p><p>\"How I Met Your Father\" dropped its first two episodes this week on Hulu. The series is being marketed as a sequel to the immensely popular CBS series \"How I Met Your Mother\" (also streaming on Hulu). It is narrated by Kim Cattrall—Sophie in 2050—telling her son about, yes, how she met his father.</p><p>Ms. Duff, 34, came to fame as a teenager in the Disney Channel hit \"Lizzie McGuire.\" She says her ability to say yes to work that's right for both her and her family is something that she has become more confident about in recent years.</p><p>\"I know my worth and I know my power more than I ever have,\" she says. \"When you're looking at your kids, it's really easy to make decisions, like: Am I gonna be here or am I gonna miss this?\"</p><p>Streaming notes:</p><p>• Return to Fraggle Rock: The '80s classic \"Fraggle Rock\" has been rebooted by The Jim Henson Company. The new series, \"Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock,\" premieres Friday on Apple TV+, which is also home to the classic series and the \"Fraggle Rock: Rock On!\" shorts.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies have you been streaming lately?

Mr. Shyamalan says that early in his career, he didn't feel comfortable combining humor with his dark stories. \"Servant,\" he says, is an example of him feeling solidly comfortable giving audiences a chance to laugh and be terrified. \"I just keep reminding myself that they both can work,\" he says.
