  "title": "Sterling K. Brown on the One Thing He Can't Get Back; At home the actor is a creature of habit, but his roles are unpredictable, including his latest as a deluded megachurch pastor in \"Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul.\"",
  "text": "<p>Though Brown says he wants his career moves to be unpredictable (he's also had roles in Black Panther and American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson), he prefers a routine in his personal life. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, actress Ryan Michelle Bathe, and their sons, ages 11 and 6. \"I'm a huge creature of habit,\" he says. \"If you told me I could only eat one thing for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day for a month, you would actually make me one of the happiest men on earth.\"</p><p>What time do you get up in the morning, and what do you do first?</p><p>I will go to bed around midnight and wake up around 6:30. I brush my teeth and wash my face. I usually have to do that first because I don't know if there's going to be some East Coast Zoom that happens. Once that's done, I will meditate. I'll do the Headspace app on my phone, which I dig a lot, then I'll make myself something to eat. Breakfast as of late has been something very specific, something me and my fellas, my boys, eat: Bear Naked granola with apples, frozen wild blueberries and goat's-milk yogurt.</p><p>I just saw a photo of you with your sons, and you looked very pumped up. You must have an intense exercise routine.</p><p>Exercise for me before Covid and after has changed kind of dramatically because I loved going to the gym. I loved playing basketball. I played for about two, two-and-a-half hours every day, but since Covid I haven't been back in the gym the way I was before. I'm looking forward to a triumphant return, so make sure to check back with me in a year to see what's going on. But now I've got a little home gym action going on. Peloton is getting a lot of love; I've got a treadmill and a bicycle. I have some free weights that go from 3 pounds to 50 pounds.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins or supplements?</p><p>Amino acids are about the only things I do. I take them after the workout; they tend to help with building up muscle tone. When I do a protein powder, I do a vegan powder. But I don't do it that much. I find as I get older, being leaner and not bigger is my primary focus.</p><p>Let's talk about Honk for Jesus, which satirizes the pastor of a Southern Baptist megachurch. All your social media bios start with \"Child of God.\" What does that mean to you?</p><p>I got to tell you, it makes me really happy that you even said that. It means I believe in a higher power. I believe that my footsteps are ordered. It doesn't necessarily ascribe itself to one particular religion, just that there's a divine purpose for my life. I believe there's a divine purpose for all life, and that I get a chance to co-create the world in which I live with that spirit. That's about as simple as I can make it.</p><p>How do your beliefs fit in to Honk for Jesus?</p><p>I grew up Christian. My mother would call us charismatic Christians, which means we believe in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues [and] the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. So for me, Honk for Jesus has a lot to do with how I was raised coming into conflict with what I believe now. Lee-Curtis is a man who is a strict interpretationalist of God's word, who believes that desires for same-sex affection are a sin. He does not allow himself authentic expression of that, tries to sublimate it, and it winds up coming out in ways that are destructive to him and his marriage. One of the reasons I was so attracted to this film is that there are a lot of people who are in the church with a similar struggle. Picking this role is in support of [those] peopleâ€”saying that if you are in this particular situation, it's worthy of examining.</p><p>I read that one goal of Indian Meadows Productions, your company, is advancing diverse and marginalized voices.</p><p>It seems like there's a wonderful moment, or dare I say movement, within show business that has shown that diverse stories are of value not just culturally but financially. You've seen young kids of color running around looking like Superman, or any member of the Marvel Universe, and now we're seeing young white kids dressed as Black Panther. So while folks are open and receptive, I want to see if I can wedge the door open a little bit wider. I was just the other day watching Ms. Marvel on Disney+ and was delighted to see this young Pakistani girl kicking butt and taking names.</p><p>Have you ever gotten a life-changing piece of advice?</p><p>My acting teacher at NYU once told me to be careful what you do with your time; it's the one thing you can't get back.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>5 Monday Must-Haves</p><p>Bear Naked Granola, Cacao &amp; Cashew Butter</p><p>\"A little parfait action [with fruit and yogurt] wakes the taste buds.\"</p><p>Peloton Tread</p><p>\"The Peloton boot camps either on treadmill or bike are my go-to exercises.\"</p><p>Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer SPF 15</p><p>\"Honestly, if I had to do Survivor, my lip balm would be the one thing that I took with me.\"</p><p>Miir Water Bottle</p><p>\"The goal is to take down a gallon.\"</p><p>Headspace App</p><p>\"That app's pretty important. It focuses my meditation on a daily basis.\"</p><p>Sterling K. Brown on the One Thing He Can't Get Back</p>",
