  "title": "REVIEW --- Back When: How Patti Smith Found the Dark Side of 'You Light Up My Life'",
  "text": "<p>Debby Boone, a devout Christian, later said that though the song is about a one-night-stand -- that is the subject of the movie -- she sang it with God in her heart. That is, the you in \"You Light Up My Life,\" played by Michael Zaslow in the film, is played by the Almighty in the song.</p><p>In choosing it for her network TV appearance, Patti Smith was doing something akin to Andy Warhol and the Campbell soup cans. She was fishing a piece of detritus from the trash, cleaning it off and putting it on a pedestal, letting us see it for the achingly weird object it is.</p><p>Great art is a drug. It changes the font in your brain so you can read the world in a new way. As with other brilliant works of interpretation, Smith's performance has aged in ways that resonate, that touch depths that even she couldn't have anticipated.</p><p>Brooks, the song's composer, accompanied Smith on piano on the show, staring from the bench with great, big sensitive eyes. This might have been the best moment of his life, the apex of the Ferris wheel. There was only one direction from there, a descent made of failed sequels and duds, the money swimming away in great minnow-like schools. By the Aughts, the composer, who'd morphed from springy-haired 70s dude to skeletal ghoul, retained a single relic from the halcyon days: the Best Original Song Oscar he'd won for \"You Light Up My Life.\" But it was all he needed to lure wannabe starlets, via Craigslist, to his dank Manhattan office, where, as reported in the New York Times, he'd say, \"This could be you holding this Oscar. If you do what I say.\" At the time of his death by suicide in 2011, Brooks had been indicted on 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse and assault.</p><p>Unlike Debby Boone, Joseph Brooks had not been singing for God. In this one song, which defined 1977 as surely as Star Wars and Arthur Fonzarelli -- that was the year Fonzy jumped the shark -- you have both the good and the bad, the garden and the fire. Which is just what attracted Patti Smith, even if she didn't know it. (She probably did). Every rocker knows the biggest hits are touched by both God and the Devil.</p>",
