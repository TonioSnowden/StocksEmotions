  "text": "<p>Cloud companies — those at the forefront of the shift in computing power to distributed models over the internet — are expected to grow at a rapid clip over the next several years, and four of the five largest exchange traded funds covering the space are close to hitting record highs.</p><p>Below is a screen of stocks held by those ETFs, showing which are expected to increase their sales the most through 2023. In an industry with many players at relatively early stages, increases in sales, rather than in earnings, might be the best driver of stock prices.</p><p>To begin the screen, we looked at the five largest cloud ETFs:</p><p> ETF                                            Assets ($bil)  Expense ratio  Holdings  Strategy  First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN  $10.8          0.51%          42        Tracks a market cap-weighted index of largest U.S. internet companies.  First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY           $6.3           0.60%          65        Tracks an index of cloud companies, with holdings capped at 4.5%.  ARK Next Generation Internet ETF  ARKW          $5.8           0.79%          46        Actively managed, holding shares of “companies its managers have identified as benefiting from an infrastructure shift away from hardware and software toward cloud and mobile,” according to FactSet.  Global X Cloud Computing ETF  CLOU              $1.4           0.68%          36        Tracks a market cap-weighted global index of companies involved in cloud computing.  WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD           $1.3           0.45%          57        Tracks an equal-weighted index of U.S. companies primarily focused on cloud software and services.

For example, the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF ARKW is the only one that is actively managed. The others track an index. It is also the only one that holds shares of Tesla Inc . TSLA, which makes up 10.65% of the portfolio, according to information posted by ARK Invest on Aug. 5. Tesla is an electric-vehicle manufacturer, but it can also be considered a cloud company because it distributes software updates over the internet continually, and offers other cloud-based services.</p><p>Another holding unique to ARKW among the five cloud ETFs is Walt Disney Co. DIS, which is certainly an important cloud player through its Disney+ streaming service, even if the company doesn't say directly how much of its sales are derived from that rapidly growing segment.</p><p>As part of its description of ARKW, FactSet says the following:</p><p>“Broadly speaking, the ARKW's managers appear focused on big buzzwords such as Internet of Things, cloud computing, digital currencies and wearable technology. While the fund's focus may be appealing for investors with conviction in these new technologies, portfolio implementation is a more difficult task: Most of the companies developing these advancements are huge corporations for which nascent technologies are only a small fraction of total revenues. As such, it's very difficult to get pure-play access to ARKW's targeted technologies — so be sure to confirm that the fund's holdings — not just its thesis — align with your view of the space.”</p><p>Cloud-stock screen</p><p>Together, the five cloud ETFs listed above hold 147 stocks. To project sales growth through 2023, we used calendar 2020 sales estimates as a baseline and then looked at consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet for the subsequent three years, if available. (The 2020 numbers are estimates, because many companies' fiscal years don't match the calendar.)</p><p>To make sure we had a solid set of estimates, we confined the group to the 126 companies covered by at least five analysts polled by FactSet, for which consensus sales estimates for calendar 2020 through calendar 2023 are available.</p><p>Here are the 20 companies projected to have the highest compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for sales through calendar 2023:</p><p> Company                                 Country      Est. sales – 2020  Est. sales – 2021  Est. sales – 2022  Est. sales – 2023  Projected three-year sales CAGR  Held by  Coinbase Global Inc .
