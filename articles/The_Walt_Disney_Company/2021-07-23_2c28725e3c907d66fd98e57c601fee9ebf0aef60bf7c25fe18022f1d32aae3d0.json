  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Up, up, up it all goes. When will it stop? Nobody knows. Prices, executive pay, debt levels and coronavirus cases all continued their seemingly one-way trip this week. Jeff Bezos at least came back down to earth safely after blasting off on the first crewed flight of rocket ship New Shepard.</p> <p>Fellow master of the universe Jamie Dimon made headlines this week, thanks to the arm-twisting tactics of JPMorgan Chase's board. Wall Street's longest-serving chief executive is so necessary to the bank's success that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bf124bc-54bf-4eb1-84ed-948cc1080b00\">a special stock award</a> has been granted to keep him in place. The 1.5m share award, worth about $50m, is hardly a life-changing sum for the billionaire banker who regularly takes home about $30m a year. Lex thought it an odd choice, though, for one who regularly opines about the ills of inequality to accept.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the private equity industry has been doing its best to beat Wall Street at its own game with bigger and bigger pay cheques. Criticism usually derives from the impact of the industry's “asset optimisation” strategies on Main Street. UK private equity group Bridgepoint cunningly deflected any such criticism of its business practices at a London initial public offering this week. Focus instead fell on the decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/992ffd6e-dbb8-42c8-b19b-709ed01f1b8c\">reward non-execs</a> with substantial golden handshakes. Lex thought Archie Norman's appointment as senior independent director was a poor deal for minority shareholders.</p> <p>The same trends keeping executives in clover are also helping those who manage all that money. Swiss bank UBS said assets under management increased a quarter to $4.5tn in the year to June. Rising stock markets helped boost the total but $34bn in new flows is not to be sniffed at. Chief executive Ralph Hamers now only has to work out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b42aa135-8a32-46c3-96b9-4cc70a5f78dd\">where to put it all</a>. Shareholders, meanwhile, need only concern themselves with their cut of the fees. Lex reckoned the bank had about $4.4bn spare capital or about three times what analysts currently expect back in dividends.</p> <p>Another servant to the world's wealthy not faring as well is Italian fashion group Zegna. Working-from-home trends mean suit sales have unravelled and spurred a decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86f8c2e9-671a-4db7-8b68-779357126448\">end 100 years of private ownership</a>. Zegna instead will reverse into the US special purpose acquisition company of former UBS boss Sergio Ermotti. The Zegna family will maintain control with a 62 per cent stake. A multiple for shares more in line with Burberry and Kering at 18 times, half that of Prada, reflects the group's need to find new opportunities in leisurewear and accessories.</p> <p>Compared with some US Spac deals allowed over the past year, Zegna is gold-plated. Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be7b47ac-30b8-48ec-be22-535b8aa1d48c\">started enforcement action</a> this week against satellite company Momentus, which reversed on to the market at a $1.2bn valuation in October. The SEC believes Momentus misled investors about its “microwave electrothermal water plasma thruster” technology. The regulator will take a harder look at the role of banks and law firms, which have been generating fat fees from Spac deals.</p> <p>Another blow to the Spac boom from regulators this week was the decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a22217b2-c1f2-4111-82a3-a0c5e9e6cbec\">stop Bill Ackman</a> from buying 10 per cent of Universal Music Group via his special purpose vehicle. The proposed deal might have given investors a cheaper back door into Vivendi's vast music portfolio, which has soared in value thanks to streaming. Ackman will instead make the purchase via his hedge fund.</p> <p>Music streaming might be booming but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c11245a2-7b5f-4780-bb8a-03d0e8a3862c\">signs of subscriber attrition</a> spooked Netflix investors this week. The video streaming service lost almost half a million subscribers in North America and Canada. Competition from Amazon and Disney is not easing concerns that Netflix content has become formulaic and stale. Lex thought it should follow its two rivals and take the plunge by buying up a movie studio to boost its offering.</p> <p>Whether go-getting like Bezos and Dimon, or just watching Netflix and chilling, have a pleasant weekend.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Whiffin</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: Andrew Whiffin 2021 'Best of Lex: the high life' FT.com 23 July.
