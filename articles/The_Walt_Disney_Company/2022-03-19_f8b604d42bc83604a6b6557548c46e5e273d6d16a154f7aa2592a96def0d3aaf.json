  "text": "<p>   Mr. Chapek reorganized Disney's movie and television content pipelines to give far more power to business and distribution executives -- instead of creative-content makers -- in determining what programming to invest in and which platform is ideal for a given movie or TV show. Mr. Chapek installed one of his longtime deputies, Kareem Daniel, in the key role of content gatekeeper in October 2020. The move prioritized the Disney+ and Hulu streaming services and was necessary to keep up with how content is being consumed, Mr. Chapek said at the time. </p><p>   In Florida last week, Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, called out Disney by name, saying the company is hypocritical for making money on family entertainment while speaking out against the bill. Mr. DeSantis cited the company's work in China, arguing that Disney should answer for doing business in a country accused of human-rights abuses. At a meeting with supporters, Mr. DeSantis vowed to sign the bill into law, saying he wouldn't bow to pressure from \"woke corporations.\" </p><p>   Mr. Chapek defended Disney's initial approach to the Florida measure, including his decision not to publicly oppose the bill, by saying that Disney preferred to work \"behind the scenes\" rather than allow the company to become a \"political football\" by making a public statement opposing the measure. </p><p>   In the weeks leading up to the bill's passage, Disney's top lobbyist in Florida, Leticia Adams, met with at least three lawmakers to try to soften the language in the bill, according to members of the Florida Senate and House of Representatives. </p><p></p>",
