  "text": "<p>The chairman of Pearson has said he will step down from the helm of the FTSE 100 group following the appointment of a new chief executive and amid shareholder discontent at its performance. </p> <p>Sidney Taurel, who has been chair since 2016, on Thursday said he would retire “in due course” and no later than the 2022 annual general meeting.</p> <p>“It's long been my intention that, with a new chief executive firmly in place and with strong foundations from which Pearson can grow, I would plan to step down from the board,” he said. </p> <p>The move continues a changing of the guard at Pearson, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6760ce02-cf09-495e-8377-55011290c84c\">appointed</a> former Disney executive Andy Bird as chief executive last year and follows shareholder unrest over poor performance and the handling of Bird's appointment.</p> <p>Taurel, a former chief executive of US drugmaker Eli Lilly, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/618291ca-c1e7-4e44-82dd-87d5c46dcc11\">came under fire</a> last autumn after a third of investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a1a9adf-39c1-411d-bd63-f30750ad2ecb\">voted against</a> the £7.4m pay package offered to Bird. </p> <p>Although the deal was approved, some large shareholders — unhappy with years of poor returns as well as the pay proposal and Taurel's handling of the succession process — pressed for his departure. Pearson will hold its annual general meeting at the end of this month. </p> <p>Taurel presided over a turbulent half decade at the company, which issued multiple profit warnings. Its legacy print textbook business has suffered from a declining secondhand market and has struggled to catch up with digital developments in education publishing. </p> <p>Bird is hoping to revive its fortunes with a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95edbca0-b1af-4ff2-9d6c-10abb862b1db\">direct-to-consumer strategy</a> focused on online and lifelong learning. </p> <p>Pearson also said on Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56187f12-36c9-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\">Anette Thomas</a>, the CEO of Guardian Media Group, will join as an independent non-executive director. Taurel said her “extensive data and analytics experience” would support Pearson in extending the global reach of its new consumer strategy. </p> <p>Thomas, who is also a trustee of Yale University, has previously had senior roles at publishers including Macmillan Publishers, Nature Publishing Group and Digital Science. </p> <p>“I am relishing the opportunity to join the board at Pearson, particularly given my background in media, education and the broader world of learning,” she said.</p> <p>Roddy Davidson, analyst at Shore Capital, said Taurel's departure “felt appropriate” given the length of his service at Pearson and the recent changes in management and direction. Investor responses to Bird's new strategy had been largely positive, he added. “The building blocks are falling into place.”</p> <p>Shares in Pearson have risen around 23 per cent since the start of the year. </p><p>Source: Bethan Staton  2021 'Pearson chairman Sidney Taurel to step down by early 2022' FT.com 22 April.
