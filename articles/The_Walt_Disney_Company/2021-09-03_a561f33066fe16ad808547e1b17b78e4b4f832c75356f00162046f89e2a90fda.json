  "text": "<p>Film-makers love a big sandpit to play in. From&#xa0;<em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>&#xa0;to&#xa0;<em>Star Wars</em>&#xa0;to Spaghetti Westerns, deserts have provided the backdrop for spectacular and enduring cinematic epics. There has also been the occasional&#xa0;<em>Ishtar</em>.</p> <p>With movies such as&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19058188-a73e-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1\"><em>Arrival</em></a>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4a4ba5c-a74c-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97\"><em>Blade Runner 2049</em></a>, Denis Villeneuve has proved himself a world builder par excellence, an architect of vast filmic cathedrals that invite audiences to gawp and worship in awed wonder. He does it again with the hotly anticipated&#xa0;<em>Dune</em>, taking on the Frank Herbert sci-fi novel that defeated Alejandro Jodorowsky (his film regrettably unmade) and David Lynch (his regrettably made), and turning it into a $165m crowd-pleasing spectacle.</p> <p>The set-up is convoluted to say the least but Villeneuve does a far better job than Lynch in making it mostly comprehensible even for those unversed in the novel. He does well to turn quickly to the domestic rather than the galactic: a breakfast scene in which the heir of House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), is briefed by his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) for an official engagement. She also trains him in a supernatural form of voice control even more powerful than Alexa.</p> <p>A transition of power is under way, with House Atreides poised to take control of the planet Arrakis, an inhospitable wasteland prized only for its rare raw material, spice, which doubles as both psychoactive drug and interplanetary fuel. If that wasn't enough to bring to mind US interventionism and hunger for Middle East resources, a lamenting voiceover delivered by one of the desert's native Fremen can't help but invoke the flight from Afghanistan: “One day by imperial decree they were gone. Who will our next oppressors be?”</p> <p>The House Atreides leader Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, making his third appearance in Venice this week) is benevolent but resolute and committed to military and diplomatic duty, his son less so. The quiet and sensitive Paul, like his biblical namesake, has powerful visions, his dominated by a young Fremen beauty (Zendaya), her eyes a bright blue through exposure to spice. From his mother Paul may have inherited special powers but first he must pass infernal tests, the worst administered by a deliciously creepy Charlotte Rampling.</p> <p>On Arrakis it quickly becomes clear that the handover of power is going to be anything but smooth. The biggest threat comes from the Harkonnen, a murderous horde led by a grotesque Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) first seen from behind, rubbing his giant bald head like Brando in&#xa0;<em>Apocalypse Now</em>, another tale of military occupation gone wrong.</p> <p>The art direction, production and costume are something to behold. Elegant blacks and greys combine with swaths of gold, everything exuding a cool modernist sheen and set to a crunching Hans Zimmer score. Villeneuve ramps up the scale again and again. As if the escalating battles and desert tech weren't enough — hovering spacecraft with dragonfly wings are a highlight — there are also marauding sandworms, huge burrowing beasts that appear out of the ground to swallow entire military bases.&#xa0;</p> <p>Such pseudo-spiritual sci-fi adventures often teeter on the edge of the ridiculous, but&#xa0;<em>Dune</em>&#xa0;mostly stays on the right side of risible, save for an elaborate “sandwalk” that looks silly enough to come out of Monty Python's ministry.</p> <p>If the ending itself is strangely inconclusive, it is because Villeneuve and his story are not yet done, the director having pinned his hopes on a sequel, as yet unconfirmed by backers Warner Bros. It's a dangerous gamble, especially given the disappointing box-office return achieved by his $260m&#xa0;<em>Blade Runner 2049</em>&#xa0;just a few years ago.</p> <p>These days, makers of big-budget movies must be franchise builders as well as world builders. Behemoths like&#xa0;<em>Dune</em>&#xa0;have become too big to fail, at least if film-makers want to keep taking on such expansive projects and ward off the desertification of the cinematic landscape.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>To September 11,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"http://labiennale.org/\"><em>labiennale.org</em></a></p><p>Source: Raphael Abraham 2021 'Dune is a stellar crowd-pleaser on a vast scale' FT.com 3 September.
