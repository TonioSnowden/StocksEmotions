  "text": "<p>The Robert A.M. Stern-designed estate comprises nine structures on roughly 5 acres, connected by gardens and courtyards, according to listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency. On a bluff above a tiny beach known as Watkins Cove, the property has an oceanfront cabana accessed via a cliff-side elevator, Mr. Rappaport said.</p><p>The roughly 25,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style estate, which has antique stonework and terra-cotta roofs, is reminiscent of old estates along France's Cote d'Azur, Mr. Rappaport said. Its amenities include a gym, several guesthouses, an office and a pool that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. An underground tunnel from the pool area leads to a large movie theater.</p><p>The property has a total of 16 bedrooms and 28 bathrooms across the main house and guesthouses, as well as a two-bedroom caretaker's cottage.</p><p>Mr. Eisner and his wife, Jane Eisner, originally purchased a piece of land on the bluffs in the mid-1990s and have been adding adjacent parcels since then, Mr. Rappaport said. The estate comprises at least five separate parcels, records show. The Eisners commissioned Mr. Stern, an architect known for designing iconic New York City buildings like 15 Central Park West, to design the property. The compound was gradually constructed over decades and finally completed in 2020, Mr. Rappaport said.</p><p>Mr. Rappaport said Mr. Eisner is selling because he \"loves the creative process\" and wants to find another project. Mr. Eisner's property portfolio includes a ranch in Snowmass, Colo., a mansion in Bel-Air and an apartment on New York's Upper East Side, records show.</p><p>The estate comes on the market amid a boom in high-priced Malibu properties. Last year, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and his wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, purchased a Malibu compound for $177 million, setting a California record.</p><p>Mr. Eisner, 80, served as chief executive of Disney from 1984 to 2005.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
