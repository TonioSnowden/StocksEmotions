Government receipts for the month rose 18% from a year earlier to $315 billion, not adjusting for calendar differences, the Treasury said. </p><p>\n  The decline extended a trend that began in October. </p><p>\n  -- Amara Omeokwe </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NEW YORK CITY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Doormen Warn of </p><p>\n  Strike Over Benefits </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Doormen for some of New York City's fanciest apartment buildings are threatening to strike next week unless they can resolve a dispute over health benefits and paid leave. </p><p>\n  An estimated 32,000 doormen, superintendents, maintenance workers and other residential-building staff could go on strike if an agreement isn't reached before their contract expires April 20, according to their SEIU-32BJ union. </p><p>\n  Under the current contract, workers don't pay anything for family health-insurance premiums. Building owners say they should start shouldering part of the cost. </p><p>\n  -- Kate King </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  OBITUARY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Gilbert Gottfried, </p><p>\n  Comic and Actor, 67 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Gilbert Gottfried, the comedian and actor known for his distinctive voice, has died.
