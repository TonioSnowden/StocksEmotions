  "text": "<p>Silicon Valley triumphed at the Emmy Awards on Sunday, as Netflix's <em>The Crown</em> and Apple TV+'s <em>Ted Lasso</em> took top series honours and cemented the dominance in the US of programming created for streaming services. </p> <p>Netflix's fourth season of <em>The Crown</em> won the Emmy for best drama, a first for the streaming pioneer. The show dominated in the acting categories, with wins for Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Elizabeth, and Josh O'Connor, who portrays Prince Charles.</p> <p>Gillian Anderson won best supporting actress in a drama series for her portrayal of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, while Tobias Menzies won best supporting actor in a drama series for his turn as Prince Philip. </p> <p><em>The Crown</em> won seven awards in total while Netflix's <em>The Queen's Gambit</em> won two prizes, including best limited series.</p> <p><em>Ted Lasso</em>, a feel-good programme&#xa0;about an American who is hired to coach a British football team, won best comedy series, a big achievement for Apple's streaming service, which launched only two years ago. Jason Sudeikis, the show's star, won the top award for comedy acting. </p> <p>A pandemic hit that was promoted with the slogan&#xa0;“Kindness makes a comeback”, <em>Ted Lasso</em> has been Apple's first bona fide success. The company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7f4326-c2bf-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9\">earmarked more than $6bn</a> in 2019 for its streaming effort, a war chest that allowed it to lure top talent. </p> <p>The competition may become even fiercer as the streaming industry enters what analysts have dubbed a “land grab” phase, following recent launches of Disney, Paramount+, HBO Max and others. </p> <p>This was the second Emmy ceremony disrupted by Covid-19. Worries about the Delta variant of coronavirus forced organisers to move the ceremony to an outdoor tent in downtown Los Angeles. </p> <p>While most of the usual glitzy parties were scrapped, stars still <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/emmys-red-carpet-fashion-2021-best-worst-looks-1235016236/\">posed outside on the red carpet</a>. About 500 people attended the&#xa0;ceremony, the Associated Press estimated. <br></p><p>Source: Christopher Grimes in Los Angeles  2021 'Netflix and Apple take honours at Emmys dominated by streaming services' FT.com 20 September.
