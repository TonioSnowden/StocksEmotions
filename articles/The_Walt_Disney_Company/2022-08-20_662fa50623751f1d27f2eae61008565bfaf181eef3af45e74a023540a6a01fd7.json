  "text": "<p>This summer's transfer window has baffled the world of football. <strong>Todd Boehly </strong>and <strong>Clearlake Capital </strong>are spending freely at <strong>Chelsea</strong>, defying fears that American investors would tighten the purse strings. <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> have shaken off the financial straitjacket long enough to register some (not all) of the club's many new signings. And newly promoted <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> have taken an unorthodox “buy an entirely new squad” approach to this season, spending £130mn so far on 15 arrivals.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Over at <strong>Manchester United</strong>, a much bigger trade is rumoured to be in play: the Glazer family could, perhaps, just possibly, be willing to sell England's most famous club. It's worth noting that headlines about United being for sale have been around for more than a decade.</p> <p>Still, we spent the week ringing up the sort of investors who'd love to buy in . . . but they're sceptical. Further, we have a special dispatch from the FT's Asia business editor Leo Lewis on corruption arrests related to last year's Tokyo Olympics. Do read on —<em> Samuel Agini, sports business reporter</em></p> <h1>Manchester United: no glazing over the problems</h1> <p>Manchester United head into this weekend in an unfamiliar position: sitting bottom of the <strong>Premier League</strong>. The team's dire performance has led to demands for “radical change” from the supporters' trust, and helped fuel speculation that the Glazer family's hold over the club might be up for discussion. Billionaire fan <strong>Jim Ratcliffe</strong> even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aae4029a-7f28-4b6f-92ae-20d41fad7ae8\">pitched himself</a> as a heroic white (or red?) knight should the “for sale” sign go up.</p> <p>Critics accuse the club's American owners of hoovering cash out since they bought it in a leveraged buyout in 2005. More than £1bn has gone on interest payments, debts and dividends under their ownership. All that money has come from the club's own coffers, while rivals <strong>Manchester City</strong> and <strong>Chelsea</strong> have had the support of wealthy benefactors.</p> <p>But United's on-pitch troubles cannot be blamed on being frugal. The club has spent £1.35bn on players in the past 10 years, according to Transfermarkt, the fifth biggest spender in Europe and third highest in the Premier League. In that time the club has recorded a negative balance of £971mn in the transfer market, easily the worst in Europe. Waste, not want, has been the issue.</p> <p>As recently as 2018, United sat at the top of Deloitte's financial league table of European football in terms of revenue. Now it languishes in fifth.</p> <p>The Glazers have long resisted vitriol from supporters. Despite the club's poor start to the new season, longtime Glazer watchers are sceptical about the prospect of a change of control. After all, the family has sold shares before, notably in the club's 2012 initial public offering in New York, without giving up their hold on the voting rights.</p> <p>And if all that's up for grabs is a minority stake, why bother? The Glazers, loathed by fans and struggling to build a side that can win, would still call the shots.</p> <p>“Nobody in their right mind would take a minority interest in the club if the Glazer children continued to play any part in its affairs,” said a financier and United supporter watching the situation closely. The club has not commented this week on reports of a possible stake sale.</p> <p>Others do see the logic. Sports bankers say United have no shortage of suitors. The club is a bigger brand and business than Chelsea, which fetched £2.5bn from US financier Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital in May.</p> <p>Shares currently trade at about $14, well off the high of more than $20 last year. With an equity value of $2bn, getting in now could be attractive for an investor convinced of either better days ahead or a future buyout offer big enough to start a conversation. And in a scenario where the Glazers felt compelled to sell, a chunky stake should guarantee a seat at the negotiating table.</p> <h1>Tokyo Olympics corruption arrests spoil Japan's Games </h1> <p>Until last week, and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7175a5d7-c4d3-423b-be96-7b4650467980\">arrests</a> of four people over bribery allegations connected with the <strong>Tokyo 2020 Olympics</strong>,&#xa0;the general reckoning of last summer's Games was that it had all gone pretty well, but that it was also high time to draw a veil over the less savoury aspects of the event.&#xa0;</p> <p>The arrests included a former member of the Tokyo 2020 board and the ex-chair of <strong>Aoki Holdings</strong> — one of Japan's largest makers of business suits and one of the many corporate backers of the most heavily sponsored Games in history.&#xa0;</p> <p>The arrests followed a series of raids earlier in the summer and, according to the Tokyo prosecutors, centre on allegations that <strong>Haruyuki Takahashi</strong>, a former member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics board who previously worked at <strong>Dentsu</strong> and was regarded as one of the most influential figures ahead of the Tokyo Games, received bribes from former executives of Aoki Holdings. The bribes, according to prosecutors, were used to secure Aoki's right to sponsor the Games — an honour that included making the official suits for the Japan national team.</p> <p>The nature of the allegations, coupled with the rising probability of a high-profile criminal trial, means that there is now every chance that Japan will spend months (if not years) hearing claims about exactly how bent its great national showcase had been.&#xa0;</p> <p>Japan's wish to put the Games behind it arose from the sense that, given audiences were not allowed, it was more trouble than it was worth. Prior to Tokyo 2020 there was no shortage of murk, from the steady pre-Games thrum of scandal after scandal to the eventual admission that the cost of staging the supposedly “compact” spectacle had run at twice the originally forecast budget.&#xa0;</p> <p>But throughout all this, there had always been hints at something darker. In 2019, the president of the <strong>Japanese Olympic Committee</strong>, <strong>Tsunekazu Takeda</strong>, abruptly resigned, with very little explanation. Swirling around him, though, were allegations arising from a French investigation into vote-buying around the bidding process for the 2020 Games — allegations that have forced Japan's biggest advertising agency, Dentsu, to spend years denying it was involved in any corruption.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Activist investor <strong>Daniel Loeb </strong>has retaken a “significant” position in <strong>Disney</strong>, advocating for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bfa9fd6-5df9-41d9-9309-85e50c9ee431\">a major shake-up</a> at the entertainment giant including a potential spin-off of the sports network <strong>ESPN</strong>. Loeb's <strong>Third Point</strong> previously took a stake in Disney in the early part of 2020, profiting from its aggressive push into streaming before liquidating it as the stock rose.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>A trio of US media companies, <strong>CBS, NBC </strong>and <strong>Fox</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/942ea00c-ee9d-471d-a202-41fc9d34ad8c\">agreed</a> to pay $7.5bn over seven years for rights to broadcast <strong>Big Ten</strong> college sports, a record media rights deal for the volatile collegiate sports industry and one that reaffirms the intense appetite for live sports content amid the push into streaming.</p></li>  <li><p>Another such landmark rights deal was struck between <strong>Paramount</strong>, parent of CBS, and Uefa for English-language broadcasts and streaming of the Champions League in the US. The deal, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/803160e7-326e-4fe6-b09b-992e1f84d95a\">worth $1.5bn over six years</a>, is two and a half times the value of the current agreement between Paramount and Uefa. Spanish-language rights in the region are still being negotiated.</p></li>  <li><p>Europe's top football divisions are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5c2e3fa-8dc4-4b2d-8f64-f92e8cef9b01\">struggling</a> to keep up with the <strong>Premier League</strong>'s financial might. The English top flight's revenue is set to increase 10 per cent to £6bn this season, according to <strong>Deloitte</strong>'s annual football finance report.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SOSHVACOmaha/status/1558160185927110656\">https://twitter.com/SOSHVACOmaha/status/1558160185927110656</a> <p>Perhaps you've read — in Scoreboard, and elsewhere — about a little thing called name, image and likeness (NIL) endorsements for US college athletes. Since last year, US university athletes have been able to sign sponsorships for products and services in a total shake-up of the $14bn industry. The market for these endorsements is, at the moment, mostly unregulated, but this week the boom for NIL deals may have already reached its creative zenith: <strong>Decoldest Crawford</strong>, an American football player for the <strong>University of Nebraska</strong>, signed a sponsorship with a local heating and cooling business, making good on his unique name and their supply of robust air conditioning. The resulting 30-second ad might be the best commercial you ever see.
