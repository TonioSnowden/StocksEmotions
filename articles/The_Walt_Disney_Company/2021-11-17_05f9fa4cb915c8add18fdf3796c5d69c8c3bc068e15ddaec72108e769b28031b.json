  "text": "<p>In cinema this last year, you could be forgiven for thinking Old MacDonald was in charge. We've had pigs, cows, dogs, sheep and a one-legged chicken: a veritable Noah's Ark dominating the titles. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2944256d-3faf-4184-9fc2-71699c3b0e50\"><em>Gunda</em></a>, for instance, was a documentary that gave <em>Babe</em> the Terrence Malick treatment. Staying near the sty, Nicolas Cage starred in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3181132f-fc1e-4134-b17b-0fd38ea48831\"><em>Pig</em></a>, as a man desperately trying to retrieve his stolen truffle-sniffing animal. In a similar vein, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95d6183e-8013-4c96-a8e8-39d6d0a4ad68\"><em>The Truffle Hunters</em></a> charted the travails of Italian hunters and their delicacy-detecting dogs. Kelly Reichardt's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb7cf83-a57a-4c5a-a54b-8112afcb300d\"><em>First Cow</em></a> was a beautiful slow western, not to be mixed up with Andrea Arnold's forthcoming <em>Cow</em>. Also coming to screens soon is Valdimar Johannsson's <em>Lamb</em>, a beguilingly dark fable about a sheep-farming couple who find themselves caring for a pretty unique baby sheep.</p> <p>Animals have been a perennial favourite with film-goers. In 1942, Walt Disney's <em>Bambi</em> set the template for sentimental stories centred on animals as main characters. The tale of a baby deer whose mother is killed by a hunter and whose idyllic forest is set ablaze by humans was so effective it inspired many to think differently about the environment and more humanely about animals. </p> <p>Paul McCartney cited it as a formative influence on his own animal rights stance: “If you think of Bambi, its mum gets killed by a hunter, and I think that made me grow up thinking hunting isn't cool . . . [through] a lot of these classic stories, kids have grown up feeling it's a bad idea to be cruel to animals.” Academic David Whitley writes in his 2008 book<em> The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation</em>&#xa0;how a generation of environmentalists acknowledged that <em>Bambi</em> “laid the emotional groundwork for subsequent political engagement”.</p> <p>If it was Bambi and Dumbo for one generation, for others respect for the circle of life would be taught by Simba or Spirit, Nemo or Babe. The latter film from 1995 created a whole generation of “<em>Babe</em> vegetarians”. Already a vegetarian, James Cromwell, the actor who played Farmer Hoggett, was inspired to go further. “I was working with a lot of animals and animal trainers. I cared about their welfare and then, of course, you have lunch and it's all there in front of you, and I thought, I should go the whole hog, so to speak.” Following the film, Cromwell became a vegan and an activist for animal rights. As his character might have said: “That'll do, Pig, that'll do.” </p> <p>However, these new films are different. Those Pixar and Disney movies were primarily children's films; the same cannot be said of the recent spate of animal pics. With its beautiful black-and-white photography, <em>Gunda</em> makes the farmyard into a place of unexpected poetry. Humans are off-screen — there's no Father Hoggett — and the animals, the eponymous sow, the cows and a one-legged chicken, live their lives heedless of their fate. </p> <p>On seeing the film one of Hollywood's most famous vegans, Joaquin Phoenix, came on board as an executive producer, substantially boosting the film's exposure. Accepting his <em>Joker</em> Oscar, Phoenix used his speech as a rallying call to see animal rights as part of a wider movement to connect with the environment: “I think that we've become very disconnected from the natural world and many of us, what we're guilty of, is an egocentric world view, the belief that we're the centre of the universe.”</p> <p>In Reichardt's <em>First Cow,</em> the bovine presence is really a MacGuffin — her milk is stolen by the main character in order to make biscuits — but even so the connection her sad-eyed cowboy has with the cow is something that makes us sympathetic towards him. Andrea Arnold's <em>Cow</em> is nothing but cow. We are confronted with both the definite otherness of the animal world and the possibility of empathy as we get up close to a cow and follow it through its entire life on a dairy farm, towards its final heartbreaking moments. </p> <p>Whereas <em>Gunda</em> and <em>Cow</em> were motivated by the animal rights activism of the film-makers, <em>Lamb</em> is a different breed altogether. Set on an isolated Icelandic sheep farm, it tells the story of a childless couple, played by Noomi Rapace and Hilmir Snaer Gudnason, whose lives are changed when a strange hybrid creature is born in the sheep pen. They immediately adopt the lamb as their own, bringing it into their house and treating it as their own offspring. When a family member turns up and asks, astonished: “What is the meaning of this?” he receives the reply: “Happiness.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The film's criticism is double-edged. Yes, there is the obvious criticism of human hubris in regard to nature. After all, Iceland has twice as many sheep as people. Or, as director Johannsson puts it: “Nature rules and we humans are just very small against it, even though we think we are the kings.” But the lamb of the title could also represent our tendency to romanticise nature and selfishly project on to animals our own dreams and needs while ignoring their otherness. </p> <p>There is a brilliant ambiguity as to whether we should see the child-lamb as monstrous or simply unique. It is absurdly comic, slightly frightening and also incredibly cute. Which is precisely Johannsson's point. “People read different things out of the film and there is nothing right or wrong,” he says. “I have met eight people that have stopped eating meat after seeing our film but that was not what we were trying to do.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Treating animals as surrogate children is not that uncommon when we think of pets, and especially man's best friend. Screen dogs have become stars in their own right — think of Old Yeller or Lassie. Don Johnson prowled a post-nuclear war wasteland with his telepathic dog Blood in <em>A Boy and his Dog</em> in 1975. Will Smith wept more bitterly for his Alsatian Sam in <em>I Am Legend</em> than he did for his wiped-out family. So Tom Hanks' latest film <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbeba4c1-8d36-49f1-8d6c-ddceca48778f\"><em>Finch</em></a> joins a mini-tradition of nightmarish, post-apocalyptic shaggy dog stories, the ailing Hanks training a robot to look after his dog Goodyear, retaining his humanity in this non-human bond. </p> <p>Wendy Mitchell, author of the book <em>Citizen Canine: Dogs in Hollywood,</em> believes that <em>Finch</em> is evidence of how dogs are now being portrayed in a significantly different way. “Films are increasingly showing animals not just as cute asides but as provoking genuine emotion and bonds with humans. You see that with Tom Hanks in <em>Finch</em>. There is a real bond between him and the dog. It's not just a cute dog doing cute tricks like we might have seen in Hollywood's past.”</p> <p>Chadden Hunter, a producer and director of nature documentaries whose credits include the BBC's <em>Seven Worlds, One Planet</em>, believes that the pandemic and concern caused by the climate crisis both have contributed to an appetite for these films. “The irony of Covid is that it originated out of our tortured relationship with nature. We've pushed the natural world so hard, tested its boundaries, eaten out its wild animals, that perhaps a zoonotic disease is its way of sending us a signal. The climate crisis, too, has the world talking about our relationship with nature with a depth and a passion not seen in my lifetime. Filmmakers are tapping into this.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>It also seems significant that all these films deals with animals in a domesticated context. We are not seeking communion with wild, unknowable nature, like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9979bfb8-b5fa-11ea-8ecb-0994e384dffe\">Werner Herzog</a>'s <em>Grizzly Man</em>, but rather with the man-made tamed version in our farmyards and our own homes. Film-makers are reassessing our closest relationships to animals, and in the case of <em>Lamb, </em>offering a jolt of uncanny discomfort to our easy categories.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: John Bleasdale 2021 'Lamb and cinema's fresh take on the creature feature' FT.com 17 November.
