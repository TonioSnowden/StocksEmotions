  "text": "<p>    Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Chapek said the company could eventually group all its streaming products under its flagship Disney+ app and could tie that service more closely to its theme-parks business. </p><p>   Speaking Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investor conference, Mr. Chapek said that \"there's a little bit of consumer friction\" for streaming customers who want to shift between Disney's family-focused and franchise content in Disney+ and the general entertainment content of Hulu or sports-focused content on ESPN+. </p><p>   Viewers must toggle between different apps on their smartphones, televisions and other devices to watch content on each service. Placing all three services under one umbrella in a single app would reduce that friction, Mr. Chapek said. </p><p>   The company has already experimented with such a model in Europe, where the Star streaming brand, which includes many shows that also air on Hulu, is already part of Disney+. </p><p>   Mr. Chapek referred to this sort of packaging, in a single app, as a \"hard bundle,\" as opposed to the softer bundles it already offers in the U.S., where consumers get a price discount for signing up for several services but they remain on separate apps. </p><p>   To integrate Hulu into an all-in-one app, Disney must take full ownership of that service, which is now one-third owned by Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, Mr. Chapek said. </p><p>   Under a 2019 agreement, Disney had the right to force a sale of Comcast's stake at fair market value, starting in 2024, with a floor valuation of $27.5 billion for the whole service. Comcast also can require Disney to purchase its stake. </p><p>   Other media companies are moving to simplify their offerings. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. has said it would combine its Discovery+ service with HBO Max. Paramount Global is considering closing its Showtime streaming service and merging its content into Paramount+, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. </p><p>   \"I do believe that we'd have to have full ownership of Hulu to integrate it into Disney Plus,\" Mr. Chapek said. \"We would love to get to the endpoint earlier.\" </p><p></p>",
