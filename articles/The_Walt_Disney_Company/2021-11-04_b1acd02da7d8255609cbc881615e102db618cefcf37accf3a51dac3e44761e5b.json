  "title": "Technology:  'CoComelon' Owner Nears Sale  To Blackstone-Backed Company  ----  By Miriam Gottfried and Benjamin Mullin",
  "text": "<p>   Moonbug Entertainment Ltd., the company behind hit children's shows \"CoComelon\" and \"Blippi,\" is close to a deal to sell to a media company backed by private-equity firm Blackstone Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The deal would value Moonbug at more than $2.75 billion, the people said. The talks are advanced and the deal could be announced in the coming days, the people said. Terms aren't finalized and the deal could fall apart. </p><p>   A deal for Moonbug Entertainment would be the second major deal this year for the Blackstone-backed entertainment venture, which has yet to find a name for itself and is run by former Walt Disney Co. executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs. Earlier this year, the company spent $900 million to acquire Hello Sunshine, the media company founded by Reese Witherspoon. </p><p>   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Moonbug was the subject of takeover interest, citing the company run by Messrs. Mayer and Staggs as a suitor. </p><p>   Earlier Wednesday, The Information reported that the Blackstone-backed firm was nearing a deal to buy Moonbug for about $3 billion. </p><p>   \"CoComelon\" was one of the breakout hits of the pandemic, according to data firm Parrot Analytics, with parents turning to the show's gentle melodies and computer-generated toddlers to entertain their children during lockdown. The show, which scored billions of views on YouTube, has given rise to a spinoff series on Netflix Inc. and merchandise in Walmart Inc. stores. </p><p>   The race for video-streaming subscribers is driving media companies to sell or merge with bigger players to better compete with the likes of Netflix. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc. said it was purchasing MGM for about $8.45 billion including debt, part of a bid to expand its Prime Video service. AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. this year reached a deal to combine their assets, part of a plan to create a streaming titan that would put Discovery's homespun TV shows under the same corporate umbrella as HBO. </p><p>   Moonbug is looking to meet the growing appetite for children's content as the pipeline for popular shows from traditional TV networks runs dry. Demand for children's content grew nearly 58% since the beginning of 2020, according to Parrot Analytics. </p><p>   London-based Moonbug was co-founded in 2018 by Rene Rechtman and John Robson, former employees of Disney and ViacomCBS Inc.'s Paramount Pictures. Moonbug scouts for popular children's shows and characters on video platforms like YouTube -- including the suspender-clad educational narrator \"Blippi\" -- and builds franchises that could include streaming-TV deals, movies and merchandise. </p><p>   Mr. Mayer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in August that he and Mr. Staggs are creating a new entertainment company for Hollywood's streaming era. Some media companies are reluctant to license shows and movies to rivals, Mr. Mayer said, creating an opportunity for a new independent player. </p><p>   \"The big guys aren't licensing their content outside of their own closed walled gardens,\" Mr. Mayer said at the time. \"And that's where a scaled, independent entity like ours can really have an advantage in the marketplace.\" </p><p></p>",
