  "text": "<p>The wait was not as long as for the next Bond movie to hear last week's reports about Amazon wanting to buy MGM were true.</p> <p>Agreement has been reached and Jeff Bezos is now the man with the golden gun, with the Bond franchise studios<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a796bb0e-bb92-4ac2-9bac-77f75e8b40c8\"> bought for $8.45bn </a>including debt.</p> <p>This latest acquisition in the streaming wars pushes media dealmaking so far this year to its highest level since the turn of the century, with more than $240bn worth of transactions announced. It's Amazon's largest since the $13.7bn purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97d2edb8-355c-4af0-9f00-8b0a65d818f1\">Our analysis suggests</a> MGM has a rich library of award-winning movies, including classics such as <em>The Usual Suspects, The Good the Bad and the Ugly</em> and <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, but its creative prowess as a film studio is widely considered to have peaked. </p> <p>“It's not the biggest studio in town,” said Thomas Hughes from film and TV rights platform Vuulr, and a former MGM executive. “Does it change the face of Hollywood because MGM is being bought? Not really. Does it change the face of Hollywood because it's Amazon doing it? Maybe.”</p> <p>With Warner Bros having been operating within AT&amp;T, Fox under Disney, Universal within Comcast and Paramount inside ViacomCBS, there is not much left to mop up in Hollywood. Sony's chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/183b3866-0822-4a55-8495-621ec9970507\">said on Wednesday</a> its film and television studio is not up for sale and will remain as an independent. Kenichiro Yoshida&#xa0;said Sony Pictures was crucial to the group's strategy to become a global provider of content across music, films, games and animation.</p> <h1>The Internet of (Six) Things</h1> <p><strong>1. UK's health service to share patient data</strong><br>Privacy campaigners are outraged at plans by England's NHS to scrape the medical histories of 55m patients, including sensitive information on mental and sexual health, criminal records and abuse, into a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fee812f-6975-49ce-915c-aeb25d3dd748\">database it will share </a>with third parties. The data pool will be available to academic and commercial third parties for research and planning purposes.</p> <p><strong>2. Facebook classified anti-competitive</strong><br>The European Commission is set to open a formal probe into Facebook's alleged&#xa0;anti-competitive practices in classified advertising, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3750ad46-04c3-4010-9fc1-fe2427c8520c\">reports Javier Espinoza from Brussels.</a> Up to now, Facebook has been the only US Big Tech company to have escaped such an investigation, which could come in days.</p> <p><strong>3. Uber to allow UK unionisation</strong><br>Uber is set to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f44e60c0-ce61-4d98-a31f-5e4af8da3562\">strike a landmark agreement </a>with one of the UK's largest trade unions, the first time it has recognised a union of its ride-hailing drivers anywhere in the world. The GMB union will be able to represent tens of thousands of Uber drivers in the UK, giving them collective bargaining powers.</p> <p><strong>4. US banks cautious on crypto</strong><br>The chief executives of Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c6d03f8-03d9-40a2-ba94-44142544f9a2\">expressed caution</a> about dealing in cryptocurrencies in testimony released ahead of their scheduled appearances today before a Senate committee. In the UK, cryptocurrency app Luno has fallen foul of the UK's advertising watchdog for posters displayed at bus and Underground stations seen as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f317c2b-cb5f-4ebd-abfe-0dc5725d5538\">underplaying the risks </a>of investing in digital assets like bitcoin.</p> <p><strong>5. WhatsApp sues Indian government</strong><br>Facebook-owned WhatsApp is suing the Indian government over new regulations that it says could allow authorities to conduct mass surveillance. A suit filed in Delhi's high court argues new “traceability” rules, which required tech companies to hand over details about senders of private messages, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f349c15-5ee7-4565-a8fd-3c574aca876d\">violate citizens' rights to privacy.</a> Andersen Cheng of Post-Quantum <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00e6b9d5-a9a2-488d-821f-de6813ca4053\">writes for the FT </a>about the messaging app it unwittingly provided to Islamic State as a communications tool. This week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5a88a58-f9b9-4db4-837e-782ee0724a23\">#techAsia looks at </a>Myanmar's apparent banning of Facebook and Twitter.</p> <p><strong>6. Nissan in British battery factory talks</strong><br>Nissan is in advanced talks with the UK government to build a battery gigafactory, under a post-Brexit plan to make Britain the company's largest electric car production hub outside Japan. The new factory in Sunderland would support the production of 200,000 cars a year. The UK government is in talks with several other potential gigafactory investors, with Nissan's project the most advanced, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ee2ee6f-f5a5-4b0b-bdef-a552e6d22022\">Peter Campbell reports</a>.</p> <h1>Tech tools — ZTE Axon 30 Ultra</h1> <p>First launched in China last month, the ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G smartphone is available for pre-order globally ($749, £649) on Thursday and its distinctive feature is the four cameras on the back — three 64MP ones and an 8MP periscope.
