  "title": "U.S. News:  DeSantis Seeks to End Disney World's Special District  ----  By Arian Campo-Flores and Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>   Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis escalated his battle with Walt Disney Co., asking state lawmakers to consider ending the special tax district that for decades has allowed the company to govern the land on which its Florida theme parks sit. </p><p>   Lawmakers could take up a bill that ends the district this week. </p><p>   Losing the special district would be a blow to Disney's operations in Florida. The provision exempts it from a host of regulations, and saves the company tens of millions of dollars every year, according to a person familiar with the company's finances who studied the issue over a decade ago. </p><p>   In recent weeks, Mr. DeSantis has clashed with Disney over the company's opposition to Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, which Mr. DeSantis signed into law last month. The law, which critics call the \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation, bars classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation for schoolchildren through grade three, and limits it for older students to material that is \"age appropriate.\" </p><p>   Initially, the company remained silent on the bill. When it passed, however, Disney vowed to push for its repeal and to fight similar bills in other states following vocal objection to the law from many of its employees. </p><p>   Disney representatives didn't respond to requests to comment. A spokesperson for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the special district that includes Walt Disney World is known, didn't respond to calls or emails requesting comment. </p><p>   The district, which was created in 1967 and has its own board of supervisors and fire department, allows Disney to oversee land use and environmental protections. It includes Walt Disney World's four theme parks, two water parks, a sports complex and its hotels, stores and restaurants. </p><p>   Mr. DeSantis thanked legislative leaders \"for stepping up and making sure that we make the sunset or the termination of those special districts happen, which I think is very important.\" </p><p>   Also Tuesday, Republican Rep. Randy Fine filed a bill under which any special district established prior to the ratification of the Florida Constitution in 1968, and not renewed since then, would be dissolved on June 1, 2023. After that, jurisdiction over the property that includes Disney's theme parks and resorts in the area would fall to either Orange County or Osceola County, though the details of such an arrangement aren't clear. Disney and its subsidiaries already pay some property taxes to both counties. </p><p>   The legislation would affect five districts across Florida, but only Reedy Creek involves a high-profile company, Mr. Fine said. Disney could seek to re-establish a special district, according to the bill. </p><p>   \"You kick the hornet's nest and things come up,\" Mr. Fine said. \"That's the risk Disney took.\" </p><p>   Mr. DeSantis also Tuesday targeted Disney by calling for lawmakers to revisit an exemption to a 2021 Florida law he signed that was aimed at big tech platforms and media companies that he said unfairly deplatformed conservatives. A federal judge blocked the law last year, and the ruling is under appeal. The carveout benefited Disney by exempting any company that owns a theme park. A bill filed Tuesday would eliminate the exemption. </p><p>   Republican lawmakers in Florida said that the governor is seeking to punish Disney while there is still popular momentum to do so. If the bill were not introduced in a special session, any effort to repeal Disney's benefits would likely have to wait until the Legislature reconvenes next year after elections. </p><p>   \"The governor wants to get this stuff done now,\" said Anthony Sabatini, a state representative from outside of Orlando who is running for U.S. Congress this year. \"Most Republicans in the Legislature are really close with Disney, taking money from them, supporting their agenda. Those of us who have been vocal about this issue, including the governor, are in the minority.\" </p><p>   Disney is a large donor to political campaigns and an active lobbying client in Florida. Last month, however, Disney announced it had paused contributions to political campaigns in the state in response to the Parental Rights bill, saying it was heeding calls from employees for the company to use its power as \"an opportunity to do good.\" The company employs nearly 80,000 people in the state, mostly at its theme parks and resorts. </p><p>   It is also a major driver of the tourism industry. </p><p>   The main benefit the special district designation provides to Disney is flexibility to expand and run its operations at Walt Disney World, according to people close to the company in Florida. Reedy Creek is exempt from a host of building regulations, wastewater and other environmental codes, and certain taxes and fees related to emergency services and road maintenance. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Joseph Pisani contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
