  "text": "<p>“Prey”, a new film directed by Dan Trachtenberg, is a prequel to “Predator” (1987). That film told a simple story: an extra-terrestrial on a hunting expedition meets a US Special Forces team in the jungles of Central America. The alien makes alarmingly light work of most of the group. Only Arnold Schwarzenegger—at the height of his Eighties splendour—proves the beast's worthy adversary. It was a simple concept, brilliantly realised, and sequels were inevitable. Mr Schwarzenegger, however, was unable to return, and subsequent instalments (and franchise crossovers with “Alien”) failed to recapture the sleek brilliance or the commercial success of the first film. Until now, that is, as “Prey” matches “Predator” in clever plotting and thrills.</p><p>Part of its appeal is the historical setting. Many science-fiction stories have looked backwards, albeit with varying degrees of success. One of the most successful entries in the genre—“Star Wars” (1977)—is set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away”. George Lucas's space opera drew as much from the past, with its princesses and knights, cowboys and swordfights, as it did from a future with spaceships and laser guns.</p><p>On television the cast of “Star Trek” frequently visited planets that resembled Earth's historical periods (though these episodes often had the feel of a budget-friendly raid on the costume department and did not engage much with the eras themselves). An entire subgenre, “steampunk”, brings together the aesthetics of the Industrial Revolution with elements of science fiction; such tales often imagine alternative histories of Victorian Britain or the American West. More recently “The Prestige” (2006) and “The Vast of Night” (2019) have explored the limits of technology.</p><p>When these stories work, they do so because the film-makers have not simply transposed the plot to a different era or opted for a particular look: they have reimagined history in new and startling ways. “Prey” does not merely change the setting of the original film in the way a video game like “Assassin's Creed” might shift the action to a different epoch. Mr Trachtenberg's movie takes the historical setting seriously. The dialogue is in both English and Comanche, with a full Comanche version also available. The cast and crew include native Americans. The protagonist, Naru, is also a product of her time and far removed from the muscled male hero of “Predator”.</p><p>“Prey” also draws on the political subtext of the franchise. In the first film, the alien does to the American elite unit what America is doing to guerrilla fighters and insurgents in other countries. In “Prey” the alien is a precursor to another foreign enemy who is already on the horizon: ie, the European colonists who will wipe out the buffalo before almost destroying the indigenous peoples. History helps create a sense of foreboding. As horrific as the Predator is, the film suggests, there is worse to come.</p><p>■</p><p>“Prey” is streaming on Hulu now</p>",
