  "text": "<p>Her life to date reads like something dreamt up during a Disney story conference: pretty American teen fulfils a life-long dream of a career in quantum physics at both Harvard and Oxford. And the fantasy cash register goes right on ringing because our heroine has not one career, but two. Between all-night stints in the lab she leads a double life as a professional ballet dancer.</p> <p>At this point one of the grown-ups in our imaginary brainstorm might lean in and suggest that maybe the two-career thing was a mite, er, far-fetched? But Dr Merritt Moore, quantum physicist and alumna of four major-league ballet companies (Zurich, Boston, Norwegian and English National), is living proof that this crazy scenario can be lived in real time by anyone with the ability to devote themselves body and soul to the dreams that devour them.</p> <p>Unlike most little girls, Moore and her sister were not weaned on cartoon princesses. “We didn't have a TV in the house. My senior year we finally got a VCR,” recalls Moore, who chats to me via Zoom from Dubai, where she is now based.</p> <p>It is tempting to imagine that her mother and father (a Hollywood attorney) would have filled the hours saved with the usual high-end CV candy: fencing, maybe? But Moore's timetable was surprisingly relaxed. “I <em>begged</em> my mom for a violin — I was going to play Vivaldi — and they gave me a rental,” she laughs. “It was returned.”</p> <p>It is surprising (and just the <em>tiniest</em> bit satisfying) to discover that there was something Moore couldn't master. Sport consisted chiefly of running around the Bel Air garden with the family's two Great Danes. “I wasn't allowed to join any structured sport until I begged to start gymnastics when I was 11.” Her new hobby strengthened and lengthened her muscles but her slouchy teenage posture was giving her mother concern, and at 13 she was packed off to ballet lessons. Within weeks she was hooked.</p> <p>Late starters are not unknown in ballet — Lifar, Nureyev, Guillem — but most bunheads begin in late toddlerhood and Moore had her work cut out. “I had done gymnastics for two years but I was still definitely one of the worst. I didn't have the natural facility: I don't have particularly bendy feet and I couldn't do the splits until I was 15.” She set about transforming her body. “I would train on my own. I would put my feet under sofas. Even now I'm always in some weird stretch — I force myself to sleep in the splits.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the science block, the teenage ballet student was gradually falling in love with physics. Like it or not, STEM subjects remain a hard sell for girls and it clearly galls Moore that so many are turned off by unimaginative teaching and a dearth of female role models. Only 3 per cent of Nobel science laureates have worn a dress to Stockholm. Even today, barely one in five physics postgraduates is female. “All the textbooks are written by men,” complains Moore. “I've never had a female physics professor.”</p> <p>In 2006, Moore won a place to read physics at Harvard but she found time to audition for the nearby Boston Ballet, dancing in the corps of <em>La Bayadère</em>, sometimes returning to the lab between matinee and evening performances. The university was extraordinarily accommodating. “Harvard's so remarkable,” Moore says. “They encourage students to take opportunities.”</p> <p>Having graduated in 2011, Moore began a PhD in atomic and laser physics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Her dissertation (“The counterintuitive duality of light in quantum optics”) inevitably ate into her time at the barre but she managed to score an audition with Tamara Rojo's English National Ballet, joining the chorus for the 2014-15 season of <em>Swan Lake</em> and <em>The Nutcracker</em>.</p> <p>Moore could hardly have chosen two less forgiving, more labour-intensive disciplines. How could she possibly have crammed it all in? Her answer is as dispiriting as it is obvious. “I slept maybe <em>five</em> hours a night throughout college — maybe less? Every minute of my day I was working. I'd be on the treadmill with my physics books,” she says. “To be honest, I wouldn't recommend that level of sleep. But I had that dream and the fire was so strong I don't think I could have slept even if I'd wanted to.” Ballet was her only extra curricular activity. “Most of my life has been a very hermit, horse-blinders-on kind of lifestyle. I went to maybe <em>three</em> parties my entire time at Harvard . . .”</p> <p>The 33-year-old “quantum ballerina” is now in huge demand on the lecture circuit, both as an example of creativity in science and as a brand ambassador for women in physics. She gives talks and serves on various panels but the most striking expression of the sci-arts synthesis is her work with the Baryshnibot, a UR10e collaborative industrial robot built by the Universal Robot Company, which Moore has programmed to “dance” short duets.</p> <p>Dancemakers have long been intrigued by technology. Merce Cunningham's long love affair with randomisation led to fruitful experiments with Lifeforms software during the 1990s. In 2002, Wayne McGregor's fascination with neuroscience gave birth to <em>Nemesis,</em> in which his dancers were augmented with super-long prosthetic arms programmed to snake around them as they moved. At their best these man/machine collaborations challenge, enhance and disrupt the creative process; at their worst they can look like a gimmick, with Lycra-clad bodies dangling from JCB diggers like dolly birds draped over cars at a motor show.</p> <p>Sometimes it's best to let the machines get on with it. A big idea, a good choice of music and a few fraught weeks in the editing suite can transform hard steel into poetry. Moore's short, sweet <em>pas de deux</em> with the Baryshnibot&#xa0;would make a great ad for something — vitamins? — but for now they are selling a much bigger idea: bridging the “gulf of mutual incomprehension” between CP Snow's “Two Cultures”.</p> <p>“I'm very interested in the melding of science and art,” she says. “Often when they come together you get <em>bad</em> art and <em>bad</em> science. My main mission is: can I push the research and science from an art perspective, pushing it to a cutting edge; can I make even better art?”</p> <p>A happy ending even Disney couldn't argue with.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Louise Levene 2021 'The ‘quantum ballerina' and her robot pas de deux' FT.com 26 March.
