  "title": "For the 'Sopranos' Prequel, It's All in the Family; Ahead of 'The Many Saints of Newark,' David Chase, Michael Gandolfini and Alessandro Nivola discuss how the anticipated film was made.",
  "text": "<p>\"Where's my wine?\" asks David Chase, the screenwriter, showrunner, director and producer, as he takes a seat.</p><p>All three are in Los Angeles for what Gandolfini refers to as \"a family reunion\" to discuss their forthcoming film, The Many Saints of Newark (in theaters October 1). Ostensibly a mob movie, the film is, at its core, a story about familial bonds and the cyclical nature of father-son relationships. Chase, 76, is the paterfamilias—the movie's co-writer and producer and the Emmy-winning writer-creator of The Sopranos, the HBO series on which the film is based. Nivola, 49, portrays mafia boss Dickie Moltisanti (who was referenced but never seen in the series). He is a mentor, uncle and surrogate father figure to a young Tony Soprano, played by 22-year-old Gandolfini—a student at New York University's Gallatin School whose first major role is the same one made famous by his late father, James Gandolfini.</p><p>Between production delays and the pandemic, nearly two years have passed since these close collaborators have all been together in person. The last time they saw each other was in July 2019 at the wrap party for the film, which also features Vera Farmiga, Ray Liotta, Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll and Leslie Odom Jr. The intervening months were punctuated with rewrites and reshoots, all slowed and complicated by Covid-19. The film's release date moved, then moved again. For years, Chase had resisted requests to revisit the world of The Sopranos, and after the elder Gandolfini died suddenly of a heart attack in 2013, Chase said he'd never recast the part of Tony. When he decided to reconsider, he did so on his own terms. The result is not simply a glorified two-hour episode of the series but a stand-alone cinematic work that also serves as a prequel.</p><p>The Soprano name is conspicuously absent from the title, which does, however, reveal the film's central figure (Moltisanti means \"many saints\" in Italian) and location (the streets of the inner city). The film opens against the backdrop of the 1967 Newark Riots—also called the Newark Rebellion—which left 26 people dead and more than 700 injured over five days. Those events have long fascinated Chase, who witnessed them as a young man growing up in northern New Jersey. His decision to explore racism and the police brutality that sparked the riots and the tension between the Black and Italian-American communities makes the film feel timely despite its delayed release. In a free-flowing conversation, the three collaborators discuss the issues that underpin the film, the process of making it and its long journey to the big screen.</p><p>Alex Bhattacharji: This film has had false starts and false finishes. One factor was Covid. Do you remember when you realized it was going to impact shooting?</p><p>Alessandro Nivola: Yeah, because my first day of pickups was March 13, 2020. I was talking to Michael and I was saying, \"We're not getting through this.\"</p><p>Michael Gandolfini: And I was like, \"No. It's just a flu. It's going to happen.\" He's like, \"No, it's not.\"</p><p>AN: I was the voice of reason. But no…you have to understand it was very strange just to be getting back into costume and everything a year later, and it was like my same trailer and my same jewelry and my same—</p><p>David Chase: Your same sharkskin.</p><p>AN: The sharkskin suits. So, I had just put everything back on for the first time in a year, and there was a knock on my trailer door, and they told me, \"Go home.\"</p><p>DC: What day was that? F—ing Friday the 13th…. The camera crew just didn't show up. They said, \"F— this,\" right?</p><p>AN: We didn't know when we would shoot again, so I was just sitting there. I couldn't cut my hair, and I was sort of just still living in this character, waiting to be told I could finish. For me, this was probably the biggest opportunity of my career, and I'd prepared for such a long time, and there was so much pressure leading up to the shoot. We got into the filming, and I couldn't really believe how well it was going. I was sure something had to go wrong.</p><p>MG: It's Alessandro's fault, honestly. Covid-19.</p><p>AN: We got through the main shoot, and nothing had gone wrong, and I couldn't believe it. It just seemed impossible. Then David had these ideas for a few scenes he wanted to add, which when I read felt just totally fundamental to the story and the emotion of the story.</p><p>MG: Yeah, I think I told David when I read those reshoot scenes, I cried. It moved me so much.</p><p>AB: How much did those scenes—which I know we can't describe because of spoilers—affect the impact of the final film?</p><p>DC: For me, the additional scenes really helped. I like the movie now, and I'm proud of it now, but I wasn't before. I didn't like it, and I wasn't proud of it. I just thought, It's OK. But after we added those scenes I had a completely different view of it. For me, it was a whole different process…. We were working on it. And it was getting better, but then this one idea hit, and that made it. I thought, All right, this movie's finished, and this is really working.</p><p>AB: What was it like for you, Michael and Alessandro, to see the finished film for the first time?</p><p>MG: Well, I think Sandro had seen a cut before. I stayed away completely from it. I had been asked if I wanted to see it before reshoots, and I knew how much the reshoots meant, and I didn't want to get in my head with watching my performance and then trying to do something on set or any of that bullshit. So, I was like, I'll watch it when it's done. And then me and Sandro watched the final cut…two, three months ago?</p><p>AN: Yeah, a masked screening room.</p><p>MG: I was kind of nervous about watching it alone. I just didn't know how the hell I was going to feel. There is this amazing moment that I treasure. We got out of the theater…. We didn't want to talk about it too much. We were just letting it ruminate. It was still in our body, and…I think [John] Magaro [who plays a young Silvio Dante] had a packet of cigarettes, or maybe I did, and we just all smoked this cigarette in silence on the corner.</p><p>AN: Afraid to look at each other.</p><p>AB: How much did the script change during shooting? Were there any improvised elements?</p><p>DC: No, there was no ad-libbing. Right?</p><p>AN: No, not a word was changed.</p><p>MG: Not an O or an A.</p><p>DC: But how much did they bring it up with their performance? It's impossible to even quantify it…. The case with Michael was everybody was saying, \"Oh, well, it's going to be a gimmick, he and his father….\" And then it worked out so great that it was the right thing to do.</p><p>AB: There's the series' legacy and a fan base that's rabid and studies The Sopranos canon with as much fervor as the Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Were you ever conscious of those pressures and fan expectations?</p><p>MG: One thing that I definitely felt is important is that David and Lawrence [Konner] wrote a movie that transcended The Sopranos. It's a stand-alone film with new characters and new relationships, and things that transcend the show. I mean, the racial divide in America transcends The Sopranos.</p><p>DC: Despite what some people may tell you.</p><p>AN: I think that…the choice to tell the story through a character who hadn't existed in the show was a surprising one and one that ensured that the movie would stand alone. Tony is viewed through this other character who had a kind of mythology around him in the show but was dead before the series began, and so, that in itself just sort of set it apart and made it an entity unto itself.</p><p>AB: You already have fan Twitter accounts that are asking if the prequel can just become a new must-watch Sunday night series. So, clearly, making a two-hour feature film hasn't stopped that clamoring.</p><p>DC: I mean, audiences think what they think. It's not a good idea. It just isn't. That would just wear it out. I mean, there's been The Sopranos, now there's this movie. And now another series? Come on.</p><p>MG: There's now been, what, 88 hours of Tony Soprano? No. I mean, it's got to be about something new, or it's going to beat a dead horse.</p><p>DC: It's interesting if you go online to see what people are expecting, and then you say to yourself, You know what? If we gave that to you, you'd bitch and moan…. I understand; people get very possessive about it. It's their show, and they don't want to see you take a turn because they hold [on to] what they had.</p><p>AN: I see this movie as a Trojan horse in the sense that you're not allowed to make this movie, a studio drama, anymore. This movie was allowed to be made because of the success of the series and the branding of the series. That is a beautiful thing—it allowed them to tell a self-contained family drama, which is what the movie is.</p><p>MG: I remember when I watched it, one of the things I told people was, \"It's a movie. This is a movie.\"</p><p>DC: That's it. It's a movie. What did Bertolucci say? Going to a movie is like going to a cathedral. I'm not saying we made a cathedral—don't get me wrong. This didn't take hundreds of years, but it took four.</p><p>AB: The film touches on a lot of issues, often simultaneously—Oedipal themes, Faustian bargains, racial politics, mental health and so on. What stood out to you as the focus of the story?</p><p>AN: Fathers and sons is kind of the big theme. Cycles of the father-son relationship, which just continues to drag men down generation after generation after generation. Dickie was like, My father beat me up when I was a kid, and I can't respond to stress without violence. It's been beaten into Dickie from a very young age, and really, the same thing happens with Tony.</p><p>MG: Well, I think that [Tony's] father is definitely aggressive and violent and absent. \"Am I going to make my dad proud? Am I going to play football? Am I going to do this thing? Am I going to make Dickie….\" Making the men in his life proud was such a big thing for Tony, and I think their absence also shows the divide that it's creating for him as he grows up to be a distant father.</p><p>AB: You bring up the tragic elephant in the room, Michael: your father and his passing. David, after you said there was no way you would cast anyone else as Tony Soprano, was Michael the only person you were willing to have play the part?</p><p>DC: Yeah, I had no plan B…. I will say this—I think I'm correct about this: I was the one who really wanted him. I mean, the studio wants somebody that everybody knows. I wanted him.</p><p>MG: Well, the way it started was I had heard there was going to be this movie and there would be a younger Tony Soprano. I was like, Great. I'd never seen the show. Sounds good. I'll root him on. Then it came through my reps. They were like, \"All right, well, do you want to tape?\" At first, I was like, \"I just don't know.\" My manager at the time was like, \"Look, you're starting off. You're not going to not audition for a great casting director.\" I was scared. Really scared. I mean, what if I suck? It was a double thing of: What if I get this? What do I do? And also: What if I don't get this? What do I do? I was like, \"All right, I'm just going to focus on the audition.\"</p><p>AB: As you said, you had never even watched The Sopranos. How did you prepare? What was that like for you?</p><p>MG: Once the audition process started, I started watching the show…. The audition process was the hardest part. Just watching for the first time. Seeing my dad and seeing how good my dad was—which pissed me off in some regard and made me feel so proud. I was so happy for him and also thinking back to growing up on the set. And then having to just clear all…the junk. All the crap…, laughing so hard and crying. It felt so good to get it all out.</p><p>My dad has this beautiful vulnerability on the inside of Tony and this aggression on the outside. David's writing here kind of flipped that. I was like, All right. What if I make the vulnerability the surface and the rage slowly grows in him, right? Because of his parents. Then it was just about that.</p><p>I had known there isn't a world where I'm going to make my dad proud—because I can't. I understand that. But I wanted to make David proud, and I wanted to make my fellow actors proud and learn as much as I can—that was a goal I could set.</p><p>AN: I'll sum it up. This movie's about fate, and your fate is inescapable. Your fate was to play this part. There was no getting out of it.</p><p>MG: There are a billion reasons why I wanted to do it, but one of the main ones is Tony isn't a gun-wielding Goodfellas wannabe kind of mobster nor should he be. He's a really sensitive, curious, funny, sweet kid and gets whittled down by his parents and opportunities—seeing cool people wear cool suits—and thinks that the mob's cool. Goodfellas is the young kid being like, \"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.\" That's not Tony. Tony is—I mean, I guess that's one of the questions, right? Is Tony forced into the life, or is he not?</p><p>AB: On the one hand, there's destiny, and we know from the series what path Tony follows. On the other, Dickie tries—in his way—to let Tony make his own decision. Is that a genuine choice?</p><p>AN: Well, the funny thing with this relationship is he's this kind of surrogate father figure who's just totally ill-equipped to be a parent. He really loves Tony, and he really cares about him. In fact, he's probably the only person in the world that he really cares about, and he would like to steer him right. He just isn't capable. It's sentimental in the best sense of the word—an expression of paternal love—and a contract with the devil all at the same time.</p><p>MG: Yeah, all in one. Totally. He seals his fate, but it's beautiful.</p><p>This interview with David Chase, Michael Gandolfini and Alessandro Nivola has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>For the 'Sopranos' Prequel, It's All in the Family</p>",
