  "text": "<p>Royal Dutch Shell is under pressure <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4fc6926-e991-43ca-9ac8-3b1478c23dd5\">to break itself up</a> after the activist hedge fund Third Point built a large stake and accused the oil supermajor of being bogged down by an incoherent strategy.</p> <p>The New York hedge fund, led by&#xa0;Daniel Loeb, urged Shell to split itself into “multiple standalone companies” including a “legacy” arm focused on oil and gas and a separate entity focusing on clean energy.</p> <p>The move by Loeb's fund comes less than six months after a court in The Hague ordered the Anglo-Dutch company to speed up plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It also follows a successful activist campaign run by the hedge fund Engine No 1 against Shell's US rival ExxonMobil.</p> <p>Third Point is among the most prolific activist investors on Wall Street and manages about $20bn worth of assets. It has built a stake in Shell worth close to $750m, according to a source familiar with the matter. It previously targeted companies such as&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afa50509-afbc-4e7c-b57d-ac74ccbc6e6f\">Intel</a>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39c3657e-3c88-4ece-adb4-0fff9fc994b6\">Disney</a>. </p> <p>In a letter sent to shareholders and seen by the Financial Times, Third Point said Shell had “an incoherent, conflicting set of strategies” as a result of too many stakeholders pushing the company in different directions. In results published earlier today, Shell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6570670d-715e-433b-95dc-674e3e496a24\">strengthened its commitment</a> to cut emissions from its operations.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
