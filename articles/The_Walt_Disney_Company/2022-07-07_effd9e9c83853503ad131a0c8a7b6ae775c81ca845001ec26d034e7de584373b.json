  "text": "<h2>Richard III</h2> <h4>Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</h4> <p>A vast grey cenotaph towers over the empty stage for the entirety of the Royal Shakespeare Company's new <em>Richard III</em>: a constant physical reminder of the cost of conflict. And that legacy is ever present in Gregory Doran's fleet, gripping staging of Shakespeare's play. Here the “grim-visaged war” may have come to an end, but it has left a country and a court brutalised and brooding.</p> <p>It's that seething discontent that Arthur Hughes's scintillating Richard plans to exploit: an outsider, he sees the gain in playing one grievance off against another. The great irony in Doran's staging, and Hughes's performance, is that he too is traumatised: a man so hardened by personal abuse and grinding warfare that he can't see that his odyssey of savagery will eventually consume even him.</p> <p>Hughes is the first disabled actor to play Richard in the history of the RSC: he has radial dysplasia, which affects the length of his right arm. This brings a new charge to the insults the character endures: Hughes's Richard winces as Lady Anne calls him a “foul lump of deformity”; as the insults pile up, he casts glances at the audience as if to say, “You see what I have to bear?”</p> <p>But he also shoots down any scintilla of sympathy: this Richard has barricaded himself behind a wall of self-entitlement, bitter misogyny and cynical humour. Hughes begins by being very funny, darting mischievous, split-second asides into the audience. But his callousness becomes breathtaking. Getting into his stride, he turns scarily psychopathic, breezing around the stage high on his own villainy, ordering murders with the insouciance of a man changing his shoes.</p> <p>It's a glittering, magnetic and nuanced performance: a study in alienation and the roots of tyranny. But Doran's fine production makes plain that dictatorship is far from a one-man show. Key to his staging is the subtlety of the performances around Richard — of princes and nobles too trusting, arrogant or obtuse to think themselves vulnerable. The expressions of terrified disbelief on the faces of Micah Balfour's confident Hastings and Jamie Wilkes's smoothly ambitious Buckingham, when they realise the axe has fallen on them, are those we see on the hapless faces of all officials who have yoked themselves to an unprincipled, self-serving leader.</p> <p>Assisted by Stephen Brimson Lewis's spare set, and eloquent lighting&#xa0; (Matt Daw) and music (Paul Englishby), the production cracks through the story with the pace of a thriller. It's in the women and children that it finds its emotional and moral centre. A young boy treble accompanies scene changes with ethereal solos and there's a superb performance from Rosie Sheehy as Lady Anne: by the end her face is the blank mask of a woman who has surely been subjected to terrible abuse in private. </p> <p>There are a few clumpy scenes as the play moves to its climax and sometimes the comedy undercuts rather than augments the horror. But the finale is starkly powerful, Hughes's Richard staring in panic as he realises this is the endgame and his ghostly enemies rise up to form a vast pale horse of destruction.</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>To October 8, </em><a href=\"http://www.rsc.org.uk\"><em>rsc.org.uk</em></a></p> <h2>The Southbury Child </h2> <h4>Bridge Theatre, London</h4> <p>It's a church steeple that looms over the action in Stephen Beresford's <em>The Southbury Child</em>. Set in a comfortable but worn vicarage kitchen in Devon (a pleasingly accurate set from Mark Thompson), this droll new play is hugely enjoyable and perceptive about the state of the nation and the state of the Church of England and ultimately deeply moving about the devastation of grief. What holds it back is that, a little like a rural vicar, it tries to cover a few too many bases at once.</p> <p>At its heart is David Highland, superbly played by Alex Jennings, a Dartmouth vicar frayed at the edges by his parish duties and his many personal failings. As we encounter him, he has run into what seems to be a bizarre cul-de-sac, refusing to allow a grieving family to decorate the church with Disney balloons for a child's funeral. The closer the ceremony creeps, the deeper the stand-off becomes, with David's pragmatic wife Mary and his trendy new curate Craig urging a change of heart, and the family's complaints going viral online. Soon the vicarage is under siege, with locals sending death threats and posting faeces through the door.</p> <p>So why won't David budge? Is it petulance? Middle-class snobbery? The answer when it finally comes is sobering and thoughtful. He feels that in the long run the family needs to feel the pain of the moment. To go with their wishes is to give them what they want, rather than what they need. Is he right? Beresford poses fascinating questions about the role of faith and of the church in a largely secular society, about ritual, about how we respond to death and how we grieve. Why have impromptu shrines become so commonplace and what do they suggest? What do people mean when they say they are “spiritual”? How do we forgive?</p> <p>Around this gripping dilemma swirls a wry and often very funny picture of modern-day Britain. Beresford nails the phenomenon of the online trend, with people jumping on a bandwagon they will be quick to abandon once the spotlight moves on. He also touches on class, with posh busybody Janet (played deliciously by Hermione Gulliford), a doctor's wife who tolerates “the natives”, and Lee (Josh Finan), an angrily disillusioned local working-class lad, uncle to the dead child. &#xa0;But then the characters and the issues start to stack up: the frustrated primary school teacher daughter; the gay curate; the black adopted daughter; the worldly policewoman; vocation; sacrifice; infidelity; alcoholism; prejudice . . .</p> <p>Each of these is important in its own right, but none has time to unfold properly. And a plot twist near the end strains belief. But it's still pensive and pertinent, full of laugh-out-loud lines and beautifully acted in Nicholas Hytner's witty and deftly modulated production. Jennings is wry, subtle and sad as the flawed David and Phoebe Nicholls quietly wonderful as Mary, always stacking chairs, laying out biscuits and wiping down surfaces. The final scene, which brings the reality of the crippling loss at the heart of the play into the room, is very moving.</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>To August 27, </em><a href=\"http://www.bridgetheatre.co.uk\"><em>bridgetheatre.co.uk</em></a></p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Sarah Hemming 2022 'The RSC's Richard III is a powerful portrait of savagery — review' FT.com 7 July.
