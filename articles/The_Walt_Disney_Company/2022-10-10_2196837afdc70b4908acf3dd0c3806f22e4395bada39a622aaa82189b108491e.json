Parliament returns, while the SNP is at its annual conference in Aberdeen. Some thoughts on both of those things in today's note. </p>  <p><em>Inside Politics is today edited by Gordon Smith. Follow Stephen on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenkb\"><em>@stephenkb</em></a><em> and please send gossip, thoughts and feedback to </em><a href=\"mailto:insidepolitics@ft.com\"><em>insidepolitics@ft.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>  <h1>This is your party on rampant leadership speculation</h1> <p>Parliament returns from the conference recess with Liz Truss's enemies circling. One of them, Michael Gove, sat down <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/908604ca-1b94-4ce3-9d01-253b50d81be8\">with Seb Payne for Lunch with the FT</a>, while another, Mel Stride, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/decbf41e-8e9b-44c0-8419-be5280ecc9f8\">has written for our opinion pages</a> about how Kwasi Kwarteng can “reset” his economic plan.</p> <p>In many ways, the two interventions highlight the ways that the Conservative party has become ungovernable by any leader. Stride's proposals amount to tighter fiscal rules, some cuts in public spending and tax rises: an acceptable package to fiscal hawks such as Stride, but it is hard to see how his proposals could pass the House of Commons any more than Kwarteng's “mini” Budget could. </p> <p>The opinion polls continue to be very bad for the Tories in general and for Truss in particular. But who might replace her? One name in the frame is Grant Shapps as a “unity” candidate, which would mean avoiding another lengthy leadership contest. Another politician who is transparently profiling for the job is Suella Braverman, the home secretary, who, t<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/20054878/home-secretary-suella-braverman-cannabis-class-a-drug/\">he <em>Sun </em>reports</a>, is privately in favour of reclassifying cannabis as a class A drug like heroin or cocaine. I think Seb <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f59f6b32-f7de-415e-92c2-032285eb3f9b\">is right to conclude</a> that if a change of leader happens, the most likely beneficiary will be someone on the right of the party, which rules out Shapps, and someone who the left of the party doesn't wildly dislike, which rules out Braverman. (Seb uses the more diplomatic phrase “right-leaning but more ecumenical” but you get the picture.) </p> <p>The important thing to remember, though, is that for most voters, unless your house purchase fell through or you had to refinance <em>the week before last</em>, the pain of the Kwarteng budget remains very theoretical at present. The Conservative poll position could have further to fall — and there could be more panic and more mutiny still to come within the party. </p> <h1>The hate you give</h1> <p>Media coverage of the SNP's annual gathering in Aberdeen has, thus far, been dominated by a row about whether or not it was appropriate for Nicola Sturgeon <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63192125\">to tell the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she “detests Tories”</a>. Which, if you're Nicola Sturgeon, is great news, because it means that the focus of the press and your opponents (both internal and external) has been shifted from thorny questions about Scottish independence. Lukanyo Mnyanda <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac19a9ab-d95e-45cf-aeaa-70377873c6e0\">has the details in his conference curtainraiser</a>.</p> <p>In the last general election, Sturgeon played the issue perfectly: launching the SNP's campaign on independence (the core issue for the party's most committed activists for obvious reasons, but a bitterly divisive one even among some supporters of Scottish independence) before pivoting to a broader “kick out the Tories” campaign, a much less-divisive message among the voters the SNP needs to win. </p> <p>Will that be possible next time? The next unavoidable flashpoint will come when the UK Supreme Court rules on whether the right to hold an independence referendum rests with the UK Parliament or the Scottish one. As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5600fcf1-7439-47f0-9540-2b771d6addbe\">I've explained before</a>, it's unlikely that the current court will find that the Scottish parliament does have that power. That also makes it unlikely that the SNP will be able to avoid a general election campaign in which independence is front and centre to their campaign from start to finish.</p> <h1>Shameless self-promotion</h1> <p>I joined Seb Payne <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30fa75bf-1df2-416f-9f6b-3916d4a634a2\">on his podcast this week</a>. </p> <h1>Now try this</h1> <p>My body continues to be a finely-tuned instrument, in that my post-conference lurgy kicked in about half an hour after sending Friday's note, wiped me out on Saturday and has vanished just in time for me to send today's newsletter. </p> <p>As such today's cultural recommendations are all confined to things I could enjoy from my bed, like Arsenal beating Liverpool 3-2, or rewatching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Disney Plus. </p> <p>The real highlight was <em>Funny Pages</em>, an excellent dark comedy about an obnoxious upper-middle-class teenager who decides to drop out of school and pursue his dream of becoming a comic book artist. All too often independent movies will lose confidence in their third act and end with an unexpected death, so among other things it was a delight to see a director avoid that trap on their debut.
