  "title": "Book it today: Airbnb lists ‘Home Alone' house near Chicago — complete with booby traps — for just $25, for one night only",
  "text": "<p>Yes, the home-rental service's latest publicity stunt gift-wrapped as a headline-grabbing listing is the Chicago-area house that Kevin McCallister (played by Macaulay Culkin) famously booby trapped to terrorize two bumbling burglars (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) in the 1990 slapstick comedy “Home Alone.”&#xa0;</p><p>The Airbnb ABNB listing — which claims to have been posted by bullying big brother Buzz McCallister, the oldest of Kevin's siblings in the movie — invites guests to get in touch with their own inner 8-year-olds and indulge in the antics that Culkin's character did in the movie. This includes “eating junk and watching rubbish” (such as the film franchise's latest flick, “Home Sweet Home Alone,” streaming on Disney+ DIS, which the Airbnb listing is also promoting), or slapping on aftershave and screaming into the bathroom mirror.</p><p>The halls of the Winnetka, Ill., mansion will be decked for Christmas, including a “perfectly trimmed tree” and twinkling holiday lights. Guests also get a Lego Ideas “Home Alone” kit to take home, and a fridge stocked with 1990s junk food and Chicago pizza. Plus, visitors will be given booby traps that they can set around the house.&#xa0;</p><p>The listing is just $25 for the night, and booking opens at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Dec. 7 for a stay on Dec. 12. The lucky guests will have to arrange their own transportation to Chicago's suburban North Shore, however, and comply with any local COVID-19 guidelines.&#xa0;</p><p>Check out the listing at airbnb.com/homealone, and brace for some stiff competition to land the once-in-a-lifetime reservation.</p><p>Last month, Airbnb reported its highest quarterly revenue and net income ever as pent-up travel demand during the pandemic drove customers toward the travel-booking company. Indeed, the company saw 79.7 million nights and experiences booked during the third quarter, which was a 29% increase on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>Don't miss:What's worth streaming in December 2021: ‘The Witcher,' ‘Book of Boba Fett,' ‘Matrix: Resurrections' and more</p>",
