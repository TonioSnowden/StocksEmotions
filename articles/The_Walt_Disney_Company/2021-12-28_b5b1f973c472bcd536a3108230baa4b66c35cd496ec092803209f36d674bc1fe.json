  "text": "<p>   Mr. Corn was also a member of the office of the president of ABC News, an ad hoc group put together to run the unit after the departure earlier this year of ABC president James Goldston. Mr. Corn was viewed by some inside the network as a potential successor to Mr. Goldston. </p><p>   After ABC investigated the allegations against Mr. Corn, the network announced his departure with no explanation. Its written statement on April 15 said, \"Michael Corn no longer works for ABC News.\" </p><p>   ABC staffers were stunned, and some were angry about his removal for no stated reason, people inside ABC News said. The moment was painful for Ms. Crawford, who was upset that her colleagues didn't know the real reasons behind Mr. Corn's exit, people familiar with her thinking said. </p><p>   After Mr. Corn's departure, Disney's tone toward the accusers changed markedly, people close to the two women say. Ms. Menton was initially warm after they filed their formal complaints, thanking them for helping to make the network a better place, the people said. </p><p>   But Ms. Menton took a tougher posture in the settlement negotiations, they said. The company wanted a strict nondisclosure agreement so that the allegations regarding Mr. Corn or Disney's handling of the matter would never surface, the people said. That was a nonstarter for the two women. </p><p>   At one stage of the talks, one of the people said, company officials brought up Ms. Crawford's father, Jay Crawford, a former anchor at Disney's ESPN network who was accused of sexual harassment by a makeup artist in 2007. Ms. Crawford read that as Disney making a threat to humiliate her family if she continued to pursue the matter, the person said. Mr. Crawford, who was laid off by ESPN in 2017 in a broad round of staff reductions, has denied the allegations, and ESPN said at the time they were without merit. </p><p>   Disney balked at the initial settlement figure floated by the women's legal team of about $10 million, people with knowledge of the talks said. </p><p>   In the lawsuit, Ms. Crawford also alleged ABC retaliated for her coming forward by failing to renew her three-year contract, which expired in July. </p><p>   ABC has denied it retaliated against Ms. Crawford. </p><p>   After the suit was filed, ABC offered a long-term contract to Ms. Crawford, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Crawford rejected the latest offer and resigned from ABC News this month. </p><p></p>",
