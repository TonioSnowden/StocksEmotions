  "text": "<p><em>Hi everyone — James here. The humble motorbike is undergoing an electric revolution in India (The Big Story), in one of the biggest prospective wins for battery tech anywhere. Elsewhere, don't miss the head of the UK spy agency fretting about China and the resumption of Sony vs Samsung rivalries in the metaverse (Mercedes' top 10). Take care till next week. </em></p> <h1>The Big Story </h1> <p>The age of the electric motorcycle in India is upon us. Sky-high fuel prices and concerns over air pollution are driving a transition away from gas-guzzling motorbikes to their battery-powered cousins, according to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/India-s-electric-motorcycle-market-ready-for-takeoff\">this article</a> in Nikkei Asia. </p> <p><strong>Key implications</strong>: India is the world's largest market for two-wheelers. Domestic sales in fiscal 2020 exceeded 15m units, down from the previous year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Electrics account for less than 1 per cent of this, but according to the Indian financial information company ICRA, their share&#xa0;is expected to increase to 8-10 per cent by 2025.</p> <p>It looks like the transition is well under way. TVS Motor, a big domestic player, is expected to invest Rs10bn ($133m) to increase its line-up of vehicles. Honda announced in October that it would start a battery-sharing business for electric three-wheeled taxis in 2022.</p> <p>Among start-ups, Ola Electric Mobility, an Ola group company offering ride-hailing services, is investing Rs24bn to mass produce electric scooters in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. “There is massive demand,” says Varun Dubey, the company's chief marketing officer. </p> <p><strong>Upshot</strong>: The signs suggest that the uptake of electric motorbikes in India is set to boom. The shift will prove to be consequential for several Indian manufacturers of motorbikes and batteries, as well as for the hubbub on Indian streets and ultimately for the planet.</p> <h1>Mercedes' top 10</h1> <ol>  <li><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Auto-chip-shortage-shows-new-sign-of-easing-as-inventories-rise\">New signs</a> emerge that the shortage in auto chip supplies is easing.

(FT)</p></li> </ol> <h1>Our take</h1> <p>Nicolas Chaillan, the former first chief software officer at the US Air Force and Space Force, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3eb428d4-3551-4215-904e-863f1c1a56ea\">warned </a>in the Financial Times this month that without urgent action the US would lose the artificial intelligence war against China within a year.</p> <p>Since he wrote that, more evidence of China's progress has emerged. A new report issued by Japan's National Institute for Defence Studies <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/China-puts-AI-at-center-of-smart-military-revamp-Japan-report\">highlighted </a>the “intelligentisation” of China's People's Liberation Army.</p> <p>Part of the new system may include joint decision-making by humans and machines through AI. Ideas on the table include the development of new forces specialising in space, networks and electronic warfare. </p> <p>The civilian underpinnings of such efforts are also evident. In a five-year plan<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-seeks-tripling-of-big-data-industry-to-470bn-by-2025\"> announced</a> this week, Beijing served notice that it plans to triple the size of its big data industry to Rmb3tn ($470bn) in the years through 2025.</p> <p>Beijing should also establish a nationwide data security monitoring platform and improve systems for classifying and managing information, the plan added. It seems that Chaillan's concerns over China's march toward AI and big data dominance are justified. </p> <p><em>— James</em></p> <h1>Smart data</h1> <p>The chart shows how poorly the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29b64b68-7499-475c-a26d-ec24714ded6d\">huge IPO</a> of India's <strong>Paytm</strong> performed relative to other recent issues. Shares in the group, which raised $2.5bn and was valued at $20bn, plunged by more than a third in its first two days as a public company — making it one of the worst debuts in Indian stock market history.</p> <p>It has recovered somewhat since then, but the performance has raised concern from investors and entrepreneurs who fear it could derail a string of expected Indian flotations that were supposed to cement the county's status as a leading destination for tech start-ups after the US and China. </p> <p>“The worry for all of us is does this impact the broader India tech sentiment? One bad deal and one instance of bad judgment can upset the apple cart,” said the head of equity capital markets for India at one western bank. “Valuation is going to be very difficult.”</p> <h1>Spotlight</h1> <p><strong>Reuben Lai</strong>, who heads up the finance unit of <strong>Grab,</strong> Singapore's biggest tech unicorn, is under no illusions, according to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Grab-targets-ASEAN-s-unbanked-in-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity\">this interview </a>in Nikkei Asia.</p> <p>He perceives a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to drive financial inclusion in south-east Asia. But he does not see the region's traditional banks, such as Singapore's <strong>DBS,</strong> as competition “at all”.</p> <p>This is because Lai is not aiming at the typical customer base of such banks but beyond them to the hundreds of millions of south-east Asians who are either underserved by banks or completely unbanked.</p> <p>“We see huge investments [by traditional banks] in consumer experiences across the region. That's great for the consumers, but our focus is really on the underserved,” Lai said. </p> <p>“For us, it is the six out of 10 who are underserved by banks, the nine out of 10 who don't have access to credit cards — all across south-east Asia. That's our target segment,” added Lai, whose formal title is senior managing director of Grab Financial Group. </p> <p><em>Grab is set to debut on the Nasdaq via a record blank cheque deal later this week. </em><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Singapore-superapp-Grab-to-debut-on-Nasdaq-via-SPAC-on-Dec.-2\"><em>Read more here</em></a><em>.</em> </p> <h1>Art of the deal</h1> <p>Oil and gas giant <strong>BP</strong> has announced a plan for Indonesia's first <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Environment/BP-unveils-up-to-3bn-CCUS-project-in-Indonesia-country-s-first\">carbon capture</a>, utilisation and storage (CCUS) project. The project is estimated to cost between $2bn and $3bn.</p> <p>BP Indonesia president <strong>Nader Zaki</strong> said that completion was targeted for 2026 or 2027, and by that time 4m metric tons of carbon dioxide would be injected back into the reservoir annually, with the amount reaching a total of up to 25m metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2035 and 33m metric tons by 2045.</p> <p>It is part of larger development plans for the Tangguh gas block in eastern Indonesia operated by BP and partners including Japan's <strong>Mitsubishi</strong> and <strong>Inpex</strong>, as well as China's <strong>Cnooc.</strong> </p> <p>By enhancing gas recovery and by sequestering the carbon dioxide, Tangguh operators will potentially gain up to 300bn cubic feet of incremental gas in 2035 and as much as 520bn cubic feet in 2045.</p><p>Source: James Kynge, Mercedes Ruehl and Kenji Kawase 2021 'India's huge motorbike market is going electric ' FT.com 1 December.
