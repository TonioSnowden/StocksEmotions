As we look ahead, we're excited for the next chapter in the 25+ year history of The Daily Show as it continues to redefine culture through sharp and hilarious social commentary, helping audiences make sense of the world around them.\"</p><p>\"The Daily Show\" has been Emmy-nominated for \"outstanding variety talk series\" every year Noah has hosted, but has never won, losing to former \"Daily Show\" cast member Jon Oliver's \"Last Week Tonight\" on HBO each year, though it did win an Emmy for \"best short-form variety show\" in 2018.</p><p>Noah's departure is the latest shakeup in the late-night TV scene.
