  "title": "'Top Gun' Draws More Older Fans to Theaters",
  "text": "<p>The figure is unusually strong for the second weekend of a high-grossing film, suggesting that a swath of moviegoers is returning to the theaters following a two-year drought caused by the pandemic.</p><p>Other Covid-era theater releases have shown that younger audiences will return to cinemas in droves. The blockbuster superhero film \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" set records in December.</p><p>But good showing by the \"Top Gun\" sequel is particularly noteworthy because it has been driven by older viewers -- a group distribution executives say has been one of the trickiest to lure back to cinemas during the Covid-19 pandemic and one that is key to getting the industry back to pre-Covid levels.</p><p>More than half of the buyers of \"Top Gun\" tickets were over the age of 35 years old for the second weekend in a row, according to Paramount Pictures.</p><p>Nostalgia may be one draw: The movie involves a 36-year-old franchise and a 59-year-old movie star.</p><p>Other movies, such as \"The Lost City\" and \"Dog,\" have already been bringing in older-skewing audiences, and that trend is continuing, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at media and marketing data tracker Comscore.</p><p>That is an encouraging sign for the film industry to kick off a summer of high-profile, big-budget releases that studio chiefs and theater owners hope finally gets moviegoing -- and older moviegoers -- back to prepandemic habits.</p><p>Analysts are closely watching each movie's ticket sales to gauge the strength of the industry's recovery.</p><p>Each film, Mr. Dergarabedian said, represents \"a box-office laboratory.\"</p><p>U.S. box-office receipts have long been one of the most important indicators of the health of the movie industry globally, logging around $11 billion annually in the years leading up to the pandemic, according to Comscore data. That figure plummeted to around $2.3 billion in 2020 as Covid drove people out of public spaces and onto services where they could stream movies at home.</p><p>This year, movie-ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada have reached an estimated $2.9 billion, a bit less than two-thirds of where they were during the same period in 2019, according to Comscore. Two years ago, during the depths of the U.S. theater doldrums, just over 700 movie theaters were open, most of them drive-ins, according to Comscore.</p><p>Now, that number is nearing 5,000, getting closer to the nearly 6,000 theaters showing films in early June of 2019.</p><p>The global market has been more volatile, with the important Chinese box office -- the leading moneymaker during the past two years -- tumbling back just below the U.S. during the year through May, as Covid lockdowns accelerated there amid the country's strict pandemic policies.</p><p>\"Top Gun: Maverick\" hasn't been approved for release in China.</p><p>The summer movie season is loaded up with make-or-break releases from the major studios that exhibitors are counting on for revenue, theater owners say. They include \"Jurassic World: Dominion,\" \"Lightyear,\" \"Elvis,\" \"Minions: The Rise of Gru\" and \"Thor: Love and Thunder.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Estimated Box-Office Figures, Through Sunday </p><p>Sales, In Millions </p><p>Film                          Distributor           Weekend* Cumulative     % Change    1.
