  "text": "<p>The Dallas company issued new financial targets Friday, the same day Discovery Inc. shareholders approved a deal to merge with AT&amp;T's soon-to-be spun-off WarnerMedia division. The telecom giant bought the media company, then called Time Warner, in 2018. But AT&amp;T in May announced plans to leave Hollywood and hand its shareholders a stake in a larger media company structured to more aggressively compete with rivals such as Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. in the global race for streaming subscribers.</p><p>AT&amp;T on Friday said it would focus its investments on fifth-generation wireless network connections and fiber-optic lines. To that end, the company said it would cut its network of copper lines -- a legacy of its landline telephone network -- in half by 2025, allowing the company to serve 75% of its network footprint using 5G and fiber. The company said it would double the number of locations it serves through fiber lines to more than 30 million. That implies AT&amp;T will add another 3.5 million to 4 million fiber locations to its subscriber base each year.</p><p>AT&amp;T telecom chief Jeff McElfresh said during Friday's virtual investor conference that the company had lost fiber-optic business opportunities for several years before it invested in adding new customers. He added that fiber-optic expansion is now a top corporate priority.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications Inc. have both refocused their attention on broadband and mobile-phone service in recent years after scrapping big bets on digital media and entertainment.</p>",
