  "text": "<p>\n  There's no question: We're not out of the woods yet. But parts of pre-pandemic life are returning, from Hollywood movie openings to Major League Baseball games. </p><p>\n  Accelerating vaccination rates have spurred optimism, as recent data shows 19.4% of the U.S. population is fully inoculated against Covid-19, but new cases of the disease have been rising, too. The seven-day rolling average of hospitalizations as of April 6 rose 3.6%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death toll has surpassed 556,000. </p><p>\n  Here are 10 signs that life is starting to get back to normal: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Monster turnout for 'Godzilla vs. Kong' </p><p>\n  The mashup film had the best domestic box-office debut since the pandemic began, raking in a robust $48.5 million over five days despite capacity limitations at most auditoriums. The film's performance represented a burst of confidence for cinemas after consumers eschewed theaters in favor of streaming platforms and drive-ins. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Major League Baseball fans are back in the stands </p><p>\n  No more cardboard cutouts behind home plate. Fans returned to stadiums as MLB kicked off the season April 1, while capacity limits varied based on local and state rules. A maximum of roughly 15,000 fans were allowed to watch the Los Angeles Angels play the Chicago White Sox on Opening Day, as Angel Stadium opened at 33% capacity. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Big trade shows return to Vegas </p><p>\n  The World of Concrete will be the first major convention to return to Las Vegas, whose economy has been decimated by the pandemic. The 46-year-old event, which is slated for early June, has attracted 60,000 attendees in previous years. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Disneyland reopens </p><p>\n  The Happiest Place on Earth will welcome California residents again on April 30, with attendance sharply limited, depending on Covid-19 risk levels. Its Florida counterpart, Walt Disney World, has been open since July with restrictions including face mask policies and some temperature screenings. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Airlines are booking middle seats </p><p>\n  Delta Air Lines Inc. said it would be filling middle seats again starting May 1 after blocking them for over a year, as vaccination rates rise and the policy becomes more costly amid climbing demand. Other U.S. carriers had already begun booking middle seats, leaving Delta, which flew 204 million customers in 2019, as the holdout. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Hotel rooms are filling up </p><p>\n  The hotel is finding its footing after the pandemic ravaged bookings. U.S. occupancy reached 58.9% during the week of March 14, the highest level since early March 2020, according to hotel data tracker STR. In New York City, large hotels that have planned to reopen in the spring include the Peninsula, the Mandarin Oriental, and the Ritz-Carlton. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Live concerts are back on the books </p><p>\n  Live music events are re-emerging after a quiet 2020. Festivals like Bonnaroo are scheduled for this summer and fall, while artists Lady Gaga, Chris Stapleton and Santana are returning to the stage after postponing concerts last year. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'Friends' reunion is finally taping </p><p>\n  The long-awaited reunion of the cast of \"Friends\" for HBO Max will be filming after a lengthy delay due to the pandemic. In an appearance on the Graham Norton Show, former cast member David Schwimmer confirmed that taping would begin this month. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Indoor dining is ramping up </p><p>\n  While allowed seating capacities vary state-to-state, some restaurant chains are seeing promising traffic. Olive Garden parent company Darden Restaurants Inc. saw its same-restaurant sales exceed pre-pandemic levels during the second half of March. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Tourists return to the Big Apple </p><p>\n  Photos of a desolate Times Square went viral in the early days of the pandemic, but visitors are trickling back to New York City. As of April 1, New York state ended the requirement that domestic travelers quarantine upon arrival. The city's daily foot traffic has risen 15% since September, with 115,000 people coming through the area a day. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Still, things are not back to business as usual, as some industries and areas of the country that were hit hardest by the pandemic take longer to bounce back. Here are two signs that we are not back to normal just yet: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  We're still working from home </p><p>\n  Millions of employees are still working remotely more than a year into the pandemic, as companies have pushed back return dates and school closures prevent many parents from going back to offices that are reopening. </p><p>\n  New York City office rents currently being negotiated are worth 9% less, on average, than leases executed in 2019, according to data firm VTS. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Cruises are up in the air </p><p>\n  Cruise operators are pushing federal health authorities to let voyages begin in July. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. announced on April 5 that it has asked federal health authorities to let it sail from U.S. ports starting July 4, saying its vaccination requirement for passengers and crew is an adequate precaution against the spread of Covid-19. </p><p></p>",
