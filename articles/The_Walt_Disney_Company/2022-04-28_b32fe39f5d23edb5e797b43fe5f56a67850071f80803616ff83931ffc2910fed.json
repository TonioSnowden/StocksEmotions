  "title": "Feeling Nostalgic? Adults Turn on 'Sabrina,' 'Friends' as TV Security Blanket; Shows and movies from the 1990s bring a sense of calm; 'I have the dialogue pretty much memorized'",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Soto, 34 years old, discovered several years ago the lulling effect that the entertainment of his youth can have on him, a security blanket atop his regular ones. When he introduced his husband, a fellow 34-year-old, to the ritual, he was relieved to learn it wouldn't be a relationship deal breaker.</p><p>\"He can't go to sleep without watching 'Friends,' \" Mr. Soto said.</p><p>Their household is exactly the kind that Netflix had in mind when it started running a new \"Sabrina\" show, and the reason why \"Friends\" has become one of the hottest commodities in the streaming wars. Titles on streaming services look like an old multiplex marquee, often from the 1990s, with movies like \"The Mighty Ducks\" and \"Hocus Pocus\" back nearly three decades after their original premieres. In Hollywood, the old is new again—thanks to a surge in nostalgic programming.</p><p>While shows and movies have long drawn on nostalgia, executives, show creators and psychologists say that the country's partisan rifts, the psychic cost of more than two years in a pandemic and now global conflict have contributed to the latest embrace of shows and films designed to make adults feel like kids again. Hollywood is flooding the market with such programming, a balm to evidence from polls and surveys that many Americans are unhappy.</p><p>Even Peter Billingsley, who was 12 years old when he starred as Ralphie Parker, the wannabe Red Ryder owner in \"A Christmas Story,\" has been conscripted to help. He recently signed on to reprise the role in a sequel to the 1983 classic.</p><p>For Disney, the onslaught of forthcoming titles include a new \"Three Men and a Baby,\" starring Zac Efron, a third \"Sister Act,\" a sequel to \"Enchanted\" and—reaching back more than 80 years—a reimagining of \"Pinocchio.\"</p><p>At an investor day in late 2020, Disney previewed programmingstill rolling out. Of the 63 new shows and movies announced for its streaming service, 43 drew on existing characters or were reboots or remakes of older titles.</p><p>Earlier this month, Disney started advertising movies including \"Cool Runnings\" (1993) and \"The Parent Trap\" (the 1998 version) as part of a throwbacks collection on Disney+, asking subscribers, \"feeling nostalgic?\"</p><p>\"Ah, the good old days,\" Disney advertising reads.</p><p>For Hollywood, the good old days have been a popular place to mine for shows and movies for decades. \"Happy Days\" and \"Grease\" valorized the 1950s, the decade of \"I Love Lucy\"—a show reintroduced to audiences years later through the cable TV nostalgia conveyor known as Nick at Nite. Stars of \"The Brady Bunch\" have reunited for years since the show ended in 1974, and newer beloved sitcoms like \"The Office\" can feel even more ubiquitous now than when they were on the air.</p><p>The more recent surge, executives say, is in part a byproduct of the streaming economy. The arms race among services has led to an unprecedented boom in production. A record 559 new scripted shows aired in 2021, according to FX Research.</p><p>In such a competitive market, leaning on a familiar title can help a service stand out and generate automatic buzz, executives say.</p><p>Lisa Jakub, a retired child actor, has seen the grip nostalgia can have on millennials. She's especially recognized for her role as the older daughter in the 1993 \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" in which Robin Williams played a dad who dresses as a female babysitter to spend time with his children during a divorce.</p><p>Now-adult fans approach her in public, she said, most recently while she was buying patio furniture near her home in Charlottesville, Va. Often they'll start spilling details about their own parents' divorce.</p><p>\"There is this very bittersweet picking-at-a-wound quality that nostalgia has,\" said Ms. Jakub, now 43 and the founder of a mental-wellness company. \"It's amazing and unifying and comforting, and it hurts like hell because you know you can't get back to that, no matter how many neon fanny packs you wear.\"</p><p>The 1993 movie \"Hocus Pocus,\" starring Bette Midler as the leader of a trio of sister witches, has long had a hold on Megan MacLeod, who every October challenges herself to see how many times she can watch it before Halloween.</p><p>The 38-year-old leaves her job in college athletics at 5 p.m. That means the 96-minute movie can be watched three times a night. She set a record this past year: 101 viewings in a single month.</p><p>\"I asked my friends if they thought I could get to 100 and they said, 'No way,' \" she explained. \"So I had to do it.\"</p><p>\"I have the dialogue pretty much memorized,\" she added.</p><p>It was his own childhood that \"Empire\" creator Lee Daniels said he wanted to explore in his latest show, an ABC reprise of \"The Wonder Years,\" itself a nostalgic show that first ran from 1988 to 1993 and followed a family through the 1960s and '70s. Mr. Daniels said he wanted to put on TV screens something he never saw growing up: the day-to-day life of a healthy Black family.</p><p>\"This was a device to get us into my childhood. That title meant something to everybody,\" he said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What nostalgic shows or movies are you watching? Join the conversation below.</p><p>A similar strategy is at play at Paramount, where executives scour the library to see what can be reimagined for its Paramount+ streaming service. Among the new shows coming soon: a \"Fatal Attraction\" miniseries; a prequel to \"Grease\" called \"Rise of the Pink Ladies\"; and new looks at the 1970s hit \"Love Story\" and 1980s hit \"Flashdance.\"</p><p>Nicole Clemens, the executive overseeing the streaming service's scripted shows, said that nostalgia can pull in several age groups living under one roof. And since the library of programming can live on a streaming service forever, she added, children who are now too young to watch a certain show or movie might discover it later in life.</p><p>\"It will be there waiting for them,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com</p><p>Feeling Nostalgic?
