  "title": "Top CBS Executives Exit Amid Restructuring at Paramount",
  "text": "<p>Amy Reisenbach, an executive vice president at CBS Entertainment, will assume Mr. Kahl's position. Ms. Reisenbach is a CBS veteran of nearly 20 years and most recently had oversight of current prime time and daytime programming.</p><p>On an earnings call this month, Paramount Chief Executive Bob Bakish and Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra suggested substantial cost cuts were coming. \"I'm not going to put any specific numbers on those cost savings, but I would say that these are meaningful and sizable,\" Mr. Chopra told investors.</p><p>Paramount reported a drop in third-quarter profit, as spending on content, marketing and international expansion increased in its streaming video unit. Revenue grew 5%.</p><p>Paramount Advertising, which handles ad sales for CBS and other parts of the company, is reducing head count. About 85 employees in the ad sales unit are being let go, according to people familiar with the situation. That restructuring comes weeks after Paramount named John Halley as chair of Paramount Advertising, succeeding Jo Ann Ross, who is moving into an advisory role.</p><p>In memos to staff, CBS Chief Executive George Cheeks praised Messrs. Kahl and Sherman and attributed the shake-up to \"a restructuring and streamlining of leadership.\" Mr. Sherman will have a production deal with Paramount Global.</p><p>The decision to push out Messrs. Kahl and Sherman caught many CBS executives by surprise, people at the network said. While all broadcast television viewing is in decline, CBS has consistently performed better than its peers in the ratings and is the most watched network in prime time.</p><p>The restructurings and layoffs at Paramount Global echo those at other media and entertainment companies that are retrenching due to economic headwinds and the challenges of shifting to streaming.</p><p>Last week, Walt Disney Co. said it would undertake a review of its operations in an effort to reduce costs and staffing levels. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. laid off more than 1,000 employees. Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal is offering buyouts to employees who are over the age of 57 and have been with the company at least 10 years, people familiar with the matter have said.</p><p>This season, CBS is averaging about 6 million viewers in prime time for its entertainment content, according to Nielsen. NBC is second with 5.3 million viewers, not including its \"Sunday Night Football\" franchise.</p>",
