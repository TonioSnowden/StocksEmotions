  "title": "Business News:  Chernin Nets $800 Million Backing  To Expand Media Content Business  ----  By Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>   Veteran entertainment executive Peter Chernin said he has lined up $800 million in equity and debt financing for the North Road Co., a newly created company that combines his media assets with two businesses he recently acquired. </p><p>   The move is part of Mr. Chernin's aggressive push to expand his entertainment business with a particular focus on companies making unscripted content -- which includes reality shows and documentaries -- and international markets. Mr. Chernin is betting that the battle among big streaming services for subscribers will continue to feed demand for fresh content. </p><p>   \"Our goal is to build a premium multigenre global content company,\" Mr. Chernin said in an interview. </p><p>   Backing Mr. Chernin's efforts is Providence Equity Partners, which said it would invest up to $500 million for North Road's acquisition strategy. Apollo Global Management's credit business unit is providing $300 million of debt financing, the firm said. </p><p>   \"We have a war chest of capital to make acquisitions and build a business,\" Providence Equity senior managing director and North America co-head Davis Noell said. </p><p>   Although the recent stumbles of Netflix Inc., coupled with belt-tightening at other media giants including Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., has led to speculation that content spending could slow in the short term, Mr. Chernin said he doesn't see that happening. </p><p>   \"None of them can afford to cut back on their programming. They are all in a battle for scale,\" Mr. Chernin said, adding that the narrative of a slowdown is \"silly.\" </p><p>   Furthermore, as Netflix, Walt Disney Co. and others look to be more prudent on content spending, acquiring programming from third-party suppliers could become a less-expensive alternative, Mr. Chernin and Mr. Noell said. </p><p>   Mr. Chernin, who rose to prominence as a top film and television executive at Fox, has been building his own independent production entity for several years through Chernin Entertainment, which makes TV shows and movies including \"Ford v Ferrari.\" </p><p>   Last month, Mr. Chernin acquired the U.S. assets of Red Arrow Studios, makers of the Netflix unscripted shows \"Love Is Blind\" and \"Ultimatum,\" and the political reality program \"The Circus\" for Paramount Global's premium pay-TV channel Showtime. The deal was valued at $180 million, a person familiar with the transaction said. </p><p>   The North Road has also taken full ownership of Words + Pictures, a company headed by former ESPN programming executive Connor Schell. Besides producing documentaries and docuseries, it also operates Full Day Productions, a live entertainment company that is producing next month's ESPN Espy Awards. Mr. Chernin's Chernin Entertainment was already a large stakeholder in Words + Pictures. </p><p>   Providence Equity's Mr. Noell said the endgame for North Road could be an acquisition by a major entertainment firm or an initial public offering. </p><p></p>",
