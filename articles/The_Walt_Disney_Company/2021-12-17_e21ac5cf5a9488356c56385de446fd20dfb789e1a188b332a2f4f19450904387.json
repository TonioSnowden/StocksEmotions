  "title": "'Spider-Man No Way Home' Poised for Biggest Box-Office Weekend in the Pandemic; One estimate says the Marvel movie could bring in over $200 million across North America",
  "text": "<p>The movie, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" opened for previews Thursday and is the third with Tom Holland in the lead role as the Marvel comic-book superhero.</p><p>Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at movie publication BoxOffice Pro, said there has been pent-up demand for a big movie event to go to. The last one he could think of was the release of \"Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker\" in December 2019.</p><p>\"Spider-Man is universally appealing,\" Mr. Robbins said. \"There's just a must-see aura around this movie.\"</p><p>Demand is high even amid a rise of Covid-19 cases as the Omicron variant has spread rapidly.</p><p>Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment, which is releasing \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" tempered expectations and said it expects an opening in the $130 million range, based on the unpredictability of the box office, the performance of past \"Spider-Man\" movies and how films have fared during the pandemic.</p><p>That would still make it the biggest debut of the past two years, surpassing \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage,\" a Spider-Man spinoff from Sony that brought in $90 million during its first weekend in early October, according to box office-tracker Comscore.</p><p>BoxOffice Pro expects a much bigger opening weekend for the newest \"Spider-Man\" than Sony: $224 million. Mr. Robbins said the number is based on social-media chatter, ticket presales and other indicators.</p><p>It already earned $50 million from Thursday evening previews, according to Comscore. Mr. Robbins said the preview sales would make Sony's $130 million estimate easy to beat.</p><p>Movie-theater-chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. said 1.1 million people watched \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" in its theaters Thursday, the highest number of people watching one movie in a day at AMC during all of 2020 and 2021.</p><p>The biggest-ever opening for a Spider-Man movie was 14 years ago, back when Tobey Maguire played the web-slinging superhero in 2007's \"Spider-Man 3.\" That movie brought in $151 million on its opening weekend, according to Comscore.</p><p>'Spider-Man No Way Home' Poised for Biggest Box-Office Weekend in the Pandemic</p>",
