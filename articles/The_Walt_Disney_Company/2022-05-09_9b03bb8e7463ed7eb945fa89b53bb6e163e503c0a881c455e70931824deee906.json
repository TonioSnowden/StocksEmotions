  "text": "<p>\n  The summer blockbuster is back. </p><p>\n  After two years of delays, cancellations and false starts because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 summer movie season started strongly as fans packed cinemas to see \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\" a superhero thriller starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Xochitl Gomez and Elizabeth Olsen. </p><p>\n  The film, produced by Walt Disney Co.'s Marvel Studios and distributed by Disney, raked in $450 million at the global box office on its opening weekend, $185 million of it from theaters in North America, giving it the 11th-best domestic opening for a major motion picture of all time, according to box-office tracker Comscore. </p><p>\n  The success of \"Doctor Strange\" is important for Marvel, Disney and the film industry because as the first blockbuster of the summer -- which traditionally runs from early May through Labor Day -- it has the potential to set the tone for the season. </p><p>\n  In each of roughly the past 15 years, the movie industry has settled into a predictable routine: Box-office receipts generated during the 18 weeks starting with the first weekend of May onward total about $4 billion, which usually accounts for about 40% of the domestic annual box office. </p><p>\n  The pandemic derailed that formula. In 2020, after most movie theaters closed to stem the spread of the coronavirus, movies earned $176.4 million during the summer period, according to Comscore. </p><p>\n  Last year, with studios and moviegoers still trepidatious about emerging coronavirus variants and surges in cases, the summer didn't really kick off until Memorial Day weekend with sci-fi thriller \"A Quiet Place Part II.\" But as Covid-19 cases eased and moviegoers began to feel more comfortable returning to indoor entertainments, receipts totaled $1.8 billion last summer -- better than the previous summer but less than half of a typical blockbuster season's earnings. </p><p>\n  Viewers have been returning to theaters over the past six months, especially to see superhero films such as \"Spider Man: No Way Home,\" released in December, and \"The Batman,\" which came out in March. \"The summer openings really set the tone for the whole year. You don't have a summer, you don't really have a year,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. </p><p>\n  Foot traffic at theaters means viewers are seeing trailers for coming films, they are exposed to in-theater advertising and they are marketing the theatergoing experience by word of mouth. </p><p>\n  \"Momentum is everything,\" Mr. Dergarabedian said. \"You lose that momentum, audiences start to check out.\" </p><p>\n  For Marvel Studios, which has produced nine of the top 15 opening-weekend grossing blockbusters of all time, the stakes were high. The last feature the studio produced for distribution by Disney, was November's \"Eternals,\" which grossed just over $400 million world-wide, a commercial failure by Marvel's standards. </p><p>\n  January's \"Spider Man: No Way Home,\" so far the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic, was co-produced by Marvel but distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment under the terms of an agreement struck before Disney acquired Marvel Studios in 2009. The Spider Man film has so far grossed $805 million domestically and nearly $1.9 billion world-wide. </p><p>\n  \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" is about a neurosurgeon-turned-superhero who travels through alternate universes to save a teenager with superpowers. The main character, Dr. Stephen Strange, played by Mr. Cumberbatch, was a draw for fans, having appeared in this year's Spider Man movie. </p><p>\n  \"The difference between this one and 'Eternals' is that everyone who saw 'Spider Man: No Way Home,' is going to want to see 'Doctor Strange,' because he's sort of a sidekick of Peter Parker,\" Mr. Degarabedian said. </p><p>\n  The robust box-office haul will surely come as a welcome distraction for Disney, which has been contending with a steep decline in its share price, the result in part of investor jitters over the viability of the streaming business. Disney has bet big on its Disney+ streaming service, but it warned the market that subscriber growth is likely to slow before it gets better in the second half of this year. Disney shares are down 46% year to date, to $110.32. </p><p>\n  The strong performance of the \"Doctor Strange\" sequel sets the stage for a potential jackpot summer for studios and exhibitors, which are gearing up for a half-dozen big-name titles they hope will carry earnings for the rest of the year. \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" the latest installment in Paramount Global's Tom Cruise-led action franchise, comes out in two weeks, while Universal's dinosaur thriller \"Jurassic World Dominion\" follows on June 10. Disney has two important titles set for release this summer: Pixar Animation Studios' \"Lightyear,\" the backstory of \"Toy Story\" hero Buzz Lightyear, comes out June 17 and Marvel's \"Thor: Love and Thunder\" is set for July 8. A sequel to Marvel's \"Black Panther\" is expected near the end of the year. </p><p>\n  Part of the success of \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" had to do with the high number of screens on which it appeared. The film appeared at 4,534 theater locations domestically, the most for any May movie opening since Disney's remake of \"Aladdin\" in 2019, according to Comscore. </p><p>\n  It helped that \"Doctor Strange\" didn't have much competition in its opening weekend from other big titles, said Richard Gelfond, chief executive of movie-technology company IMAX Corp. The film set opening-weekend box-office records domestically and globally for theaters that use IMAX's movie-display technology, grossing $33 million in its first weekend, with $18 million of the total coming from North America, IMAX said. </p><p>\n  \"It was our best May opening weekend ever,\" Mr. Gelfond said. </p><p>\n  --- </p><pre>  Estimated Box-Office Figures, Through Sunday \n \n                                                              Sales, In Millions \n    Film                          Distributor           Weekend* Cumulative     % Change \n \n1.
