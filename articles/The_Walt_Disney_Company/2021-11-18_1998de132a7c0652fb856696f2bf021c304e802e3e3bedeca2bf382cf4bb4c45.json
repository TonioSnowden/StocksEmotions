  "text": "<p>The Premier League has sold the rights to screen its football matches in the US to Comcast's NBC for about $2.7bn over six years, almost tripling the value of its existing contract with the broadcaster and reinforcing its dominance over rival European leagues.</p> <p>England's top-tier league, which makes more money than any of its big rivals in Germany, Italy and Spain, said on Thursday it would continue its partnership with NBC, which has bought the rights to all 380 matches each season from 2022-28.</p> <p>A person with knowledge of the agreement said it valued the rights at about $2.7bn, a big increase on the previous $1bn contract signed in 2015, demonstrating broadcasters' demand for live sports as cable companies face increasing competition from Netflix and other streaming services.</p> <p>The deal shows the league's continued ability to increase broadcast revenues, a welcome boost to its 20 clubs as they look to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, compete against rivals for star players, and attract global audiences to the sport.</p> <p>It is also a sign of the Premier League's growing appeal in the US, where football traditionally struggled to compete for airtime in a market dominated by American football, basketball and baseball.</p> <p>“NBC Sports has significantly strengthened the popularity of the league in the United States in that time through its fantastic coverage and promotion,” said Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League. </p> <p>“You used to go to midtown Manhattan and you saw people with MLB jerseys or NBA jerseys. Now, it's not uncommon to see Arsenal or Liverpool jerseys at the same level,” said Jon Miller, president of programming for NBC Sports. “It's a very young sport, and it's a very hot sport. I think [soccer] is much more accepted.”</p> <p>Miller told the FT that the new price reflected how the “value has gone up”.</p> <p>“The [Premier League] has proven itself to be incredibly valuable in the US. We're comfortable moving forward because we know this will continue to be a success for us”, he said.</p> <p>The broadcaster, which has been the league's US partner since 2013, won the auction against rival bidders ViacomCBS and Disney's ESPN. The competition was such that the final sum paid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cb410ac-983d-43da-bd1e-e4faa808d157\">surpassed the $2bn</a> mark previously reported by the Financial Times. </p> <p>“NBC Sports' <em>Premier League Mornings</em> programming is now a real institution among supporters in America, with fans getting up early to come together and cheer on their favourite club week in, week out,” Masters added. </p> <p>The time difference means Premier League matches are screened in the morning in the US, meaning that there is less competition against domestic sports. </p> <p>The deal will help Comcast as it looks to differentiate its Peacock streaming service from the competition through live sports, which Netflix does not offer. Comcast earlier this year secured the rights to NFL games over the next decade, and controls the rights to the Olympics until 2032. </p> <p>Higher broadcast revenues in the US will be a welcome development for the league following the renewal of its domestic rights last May. The league sold the UK rights to existing partners Sky, BT and Amazon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d7d49e1-da14-4c60-87d7-1df5be0a0aa0\">for £5bn</a>, representing no change on the previous deal, as it opted for stability amid the pandemic. </p> <p>The league has renewed its broadcast deal in Australia, signing for another six years with Optus Sport, the broadcaster said on Thursday, as it also secured the rights to the FA Women's Super League for another two years.</p> <p>It is in the process of renewing several other deals, including in Canada, the Caribbean, central and Latin America and Asia-Pacific. </p> <p>It is also searching for a new chair after the resignation of Gary Hoffman, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48e7d7e4-c56d-4271-8bf5-4e435f087d47\">who quit</a> this week after coming under pressure from clubs that were angry over handling of the Saudi Arabia-led takeover of Newcastle United for £305m.</p><p>Source: Samuel Agini in London and &#xa0;Anna Nicolaou in New York 2021 'Premier League's US broadcast revenues soar with NBC deal' FT.com 18 November.
