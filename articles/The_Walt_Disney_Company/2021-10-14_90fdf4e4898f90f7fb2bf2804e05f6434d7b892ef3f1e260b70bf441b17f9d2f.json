  "text": "<p>One is in recent memory. When that phrase is used, it can come across as if we didn't really bother to research the history of a given issue, but just went by an informal feel on what the writer remembers.</p><p>Other timeworn terms to second-guess before using:</p><p>* fresh (fresh comments, reaction)</p><p>* amid (amid anything and everything). Great short word for headlines, and sometimes the right choice for the article, but consider that in some cases, over or during might work just as well.</p><p>* comes (we have a lot of \"this comes as\" transitions)</p><p>* set to (as in, something is \"set to\" happen)</p><p>* jitters (formerly an unexpected, interesting word; now it seems as if everything causes them)</p><p>We will be on the lookout for more timeworn words. Many of them are called out in the Tansa spell-checker.</p><p>No one wants to tie down writers' creativity, of course. Mark Twain once admonished editors on this score: \"Another editor. That thing behind his ear is his pencil. Whenever he finds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes it out with that…. They are full of envy and malice, editors are.\" But in the interest of keeping the Journal's writing fresh—uh, we mean, vibrant—we are guessing Twain would be on board.</p><p>China and Taiwan</p><p>With China stepping up military maneuvers around Taiwan, we should take care in referring to Beijing's intentions for the self-ruled island, our China bureau advises. Use of the politically loaded terms reunification/reunify and unification/unify should be avoided when writing in our own voice. They may be used, with attribution, to represent the position of Beijing and its claim to the island. Better yet is to use a neutral term for its ambition to take control of Taiwan.</p><p>Careful neutrality is warranted because of a complicated history: Beijing's claim to Taiwan rests in part on seeing itself as the successor to China's last imperial dynasty, which started to take control of Taiwan in the late 17th century. Many in Taiwan reject the term reunification because the People's Republic of China, established after Communist forces came to power on the mainland in 1949, has never controlled Taiwan. Others in Taiwan favor unification or reunification, just not on Beijing's terms.</p><p>'What You Need to Know'</p><p>As the Journal has written more explainers and guides over the years, providing first-rate help for readers, this expression has become common. But Editor in Chief Matt Murray says it is time to slightly alter that label. \" 'What you need to know' sounds a bit lecturey, like we know best,\" he says. We have occasionally seen similar pushback from readers in online comments.</p><p>Instead, when used in a headline, use the similar, shorter phrase, What to Know, Matt suggests. It accomplishes the same thing, but less invasively, perhaps. Example: What to Know About the Covid-19 Vaccine Boosters.</p><p>(We have a monthly feature called Need to Know, but that's all right; Matt is talking about the \"need\" phrase in headlines including social media.)</p><p>He said, he said, she said, she said</p><p>A note about attributions for quotations: As discussed before, we don't want quotations that \"hang out\" with no attribution. \"Like this.\" However, in an effort to do better, we might be overcorrecting sometimes. Namely, if it is a two-part quote, we need only one attribution, between the two parts. We don't have to add another one at the end. So, for example, this is correct: \"The market was bad today,\" said Mr. Smith. \"And it might be bad tomorrow.\" No need to add another \"he said\" at the end.</p><p>The the</p><p>We generally drop the \"the\" at the front of company names (Walt Disney Co., even though the company calls itself The Walt Disney Company) but in certain cases retain it, uppercase, if vital to the name's wordplay. We allow The Knot and The RealReal, but the Infatuation, for the restaurant website. Restaurants, hotels (for example, the Joseph) and entertainers (the Weeknd) read fine with a lowercase \"the.\"</p><p>And note that The Wall Street Journal is the only publication that we write with an uppercase The (home-field advantage, after all), but lowercase on a second reference: the Journal. An exception is The Journal podcast.</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* The German polling and research company is Infratest dimap, not with a capital D.</p><p>* The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (or OECD) now has 38 members, with the addition of Costa Rica. The stylebook has been updated.</p><p>* Voice-over with a hyphen, not voiceover, is our style.</p><p>* Our style is to use antigay, not homophobic; anti-transgender, not transphobic; and anti-Muslim, not Islamophobic, since the -phobic phrases assume motive; the suffix is best reserved for medical contexts. They should be included only, as necessary, when quoting someone who used such terms.</p><p>* The \"end result\" is redundant. Usually, just result gets the job done.</p><p>* What's a runway? Writers often say a plane is idling on a runway. But the terminology isn't quite right. Runways are the strips of pavement where airplanes accelerate and decelerate to take off and land. They are valuable airport real estate and it is rare for airplanes to literally idle on a runway for more than a few seconds. Idling on taxiways or idling at airports would be a better description.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Kitchen Appliance Delays Force Buyers to Cook Up Alternatives,\" ​by Lisa Kalis.</p><p>* \"Elon Musk Lets Bezos Know Who Is Richer,\" by Andrew Fraser.</p><p>Heads that make you go 'hmmm'</p><p>* \"Ransomware Attacks Expected to Prolong.\" Our first thought was: Prolong what? The headline used prolong as an intransitive verb (with no direct object). We checked, and some dictionaries do allow it. But it is unfamiliar.</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* Some begged for rescue, others tried to hide. In all, 21 runners who started the race would die.</p><p>* One Covid vaccine has emerged as the world's most popular choice</p><p>* You've moved into a beautiful neighborhood. So has the world's largest rodent.</p><p>* Four-letter words in the supermarket checkout line. Everywhere, adults are throwing tantrums.</p><p>* A secret CIA doorway known as Glory Gate was guarded by special forces. It stayed open even after the explosion at Kabul airport.</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* Houses are more expensive than ever. Matt Shorraw is giving them away for free.</p><p>* Israeli officials say their deal with Pfizer is not exclusive, nor obliges them to expand their vaccination campaign quicker than other countries.</p><p>* Officials at the Norilsk Nickel mining company said thawing permafrost caused the failure of posts supporting the basement where the storage tank laid.</p><p>* A window frame lays empty in an evacuated apartment building in Yakutsk.</p><p>* Found in everything from fast-food wrappers to firefighting foam, PFAS have been linked to cancer and immune-system problems and are considered dangerous at levels a thousand times smaller than lead and arsenic.</p><p>* \"Big tech knows more about me than my wife, and I didn't give them that permission,\" he says over Zoom from his home in Wellington, Fla., where he lives with his wife Monica and their two young children.</p><p>* As he read off the first 12 names, 20 players surged forward past others, some who leaned on canes for balance.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* Giving them away for free is redundant, so drop for free. Or at least drop the word for, as the stylebook notes.</p><p>* It isn't exclusive, and it doesn't oblige them…. We prefer to use contractions with negative verbs. And nor obliges is an awkward shortening of nor does it oblige. Also, more quickly is preferred over quicker—the reason being that quicker is traditionally an adjective, and more quickly an adverb.</p><p>* Lay is the past tense of lie (meaning a state of reclining).</p><p>* Lies is the present tense. See the stylebook's lay/lie entry for a simple guide on these tricky words.</p><p>* \"A thousand times smaller\" puts us deep in a black hole. As discussed before, something can be one-thousandth the size, but \"times smaller\" implies a negative.</p><p>* Add the commas around her name: He lives with his wife, Monica, and their two young children. We do this in references to spouses and other family members if there is only one of them. Also, we needed to include Monica's last name, even if the same as her spouse. (See the spouse's names entry in the stylebook.)</p><p>* Some of whom is the idiom. We could also say including some who leaned on canes.</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.
