  "text": "<p>In a letter to shareholders, the streaming service said it expects 4.5 million new subscribers to join in the fourth quarter, and revenue to grow to $7.78 billion from $7.71 billion a year ago, but a fall in operating margin to 4.2%, from 8.2% last year.</p><p>Next month, Netflix will roll out a streaming plan with ads for around $6.99 a month in 12 countries including the U.S, Germany and Japan. Ads will last between 4 to 5 minutes per hour.</p><p>Netflix added that going into next year, its advertising and paid sharing initiatives will add new revenue streams to the point where \"membership is just one component of our revenue growth.\"</p><p>JPMorgan lifted its rating on Netflix to overweight from neutral and lifted its price target to $330 from $240. \"Coming out of 3Q earnings, we have increased conviction in Netflix's ability to accelerate revenue growth with the help of advertising and monetization of account sharing, expand operating margins, and increase free cash flow,\" said analysts led by Doug Anmuth.</p><p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the fourth-quarter outlook was on the \"weak side\" making the pre-market share price increase \"somewhat perplexing\".</p><p>\"Netflix appears to be blaming the strength of the U.S. dollar for the headwinds with respect to its Q4 numbers. From the tone of the shareholder letter, it's clear that Netflix doesn't expect a material contribution from the new ad tier in Q4,\" he said in a note.</p><p>Read: Netflix executives o n how it will crack down on users sharing their accounts.</p><p>Gregory Peters, Netflix's chief operating and product officer, was bullish about the ad-supported plan, as he said that the company doesn't expect to see much plan switching from existing subscribers.</p><p>\"The fact that we think that this lower consumer-facing price will bring in a lot more members, then we're quite confident in the long term that this will lead to a significant incremental revenue and profit stream,\" he told analysts.</p><p>Some analysts like the Evercore ISI team, led by Mark Mahaney, said that the service could be beneficial for the company in the long-term. \"We continue to view the subscription &amp; advertising-supported video on demand offering as a driver of new subs, a churn reducer, and potentially significant revenue driver longer term,\" they said.</p><p>Separately, Evercore noted that foreign currency headwinds from Netflix's international exposure \"came in worse than we anticipated,\" but maintained its outperform rating.</p><p>Meanwhile, other analysts expressed uncertainty over how fast the new ad-supported plan could bring in more subscribers and revenue.</p><p>Andrew Marok, an analyst at Raymond James, kept his market perform rating but added that the team remains \"cautious on the pace of uptake and the company's ability to maintain premium ad pricing with little targeting and measurement capability.\"</p><p>\"Our current estimates figure in modest upside from account sharing as we believe these users tend to be more marginal and in many cases do not find enough value in Netflix to pay for the service themselves, but see this as an area of potential upside to our outlook,\" he added.</p><p>Keybanc Capital Markets analysts, led by Justin Patterson, cautioned that the investment risk in Netflix could include \"mis-execution\" around its monetization measures. Their ad ramp could come in slower than expected and the password crackdown not as effective as hoped.</p><p>Patterson kept his sector-weight rating, but lowered 2023 and 2024 revenue forecasts by around 2% each.</p><p>Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ad initiative is a sign Netflix's \"competitive edge is becoming dulled.\"</p><p>\"Rivals are closing the gap on content quality. The payment reductions offered for the ad-supported version arguably don't represent good market value either when compared to rival offerings, especially the Disney+ and Hulu bundle,\" she said in a note.</p><p>Walt Disney DIS — the operator of both Disney+ and Hulu — saw a premarket gain of 3%.</p><p>Netflix results drive one major investment bank upgrade, but some are more cautious</p>",
