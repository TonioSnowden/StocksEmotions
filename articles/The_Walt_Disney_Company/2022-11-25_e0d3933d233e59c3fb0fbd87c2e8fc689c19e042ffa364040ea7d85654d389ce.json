  "text": "<p>“Do you think that feels like a heart?” Poppy Delevingne holds a charred red pepper up to&#xa0;her elder sister, Chloe, a charity co-founder who has trained as a midwife. “No,” answers Chloe, giving it a perfunctory feel before continuing to chop hazelnuts for a green bean and burrata salad. There's a party at the Delevingnes' in Shepherd's Bush, which means, as Poppy puts it, “a bit of&#xa0;mayhem with magic”.</p> <p>A Delevingne party is an affair with “cosy lighting, lots of lamps, tons of candles – even if it's the middle of the day – and people sitting on the floor”. Buckets hold ice-cold <a href=\"https://dellavite.com/uk\">Della Vite rosé prosecco</a>, often served with blackcurrant liqueur or homemade sloe <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/beer-spirits\">gin</a> (“sloe-gasms”, as Chloe calls them), and the pair will battle it out over the playlist: classic crooners such as Frank Sinatra and James Brown (Poppy's choice) or dance tunes and Kylie Minogue (Chloe's).&#xa0;</p> <p>‘Cosy lighting, lots of lamps, tons of candles – even if it's the middle of the day – and people sitting on the floor' <em>Poppy Delevingne</em></p> <p>They've come up with a menu of Italian dishes to be served family-style (“we all think that we were Italian in a past life,” says Poppy), which they've cooked with the help of their friend, chef Jesse Jenkins. Over pistachio linen tablemats dotted with mushroom-shaped vases there are platters of&#xa0;red pepper, roasted tomato, onion and basil salad prepared by Poppy, green bean salad made by Chloe, butternut squash and prosecco rigatoni, and a radicchio salad. For dessert there is a mountain of pavlova and a jiggly Della Vite rosé jelly studded with raspberries and blueberries. “We never do courses,” says Poppy. “It's big plates with wooden spoons and everyone can dig in.”</p> <p>At family parties, games are central but must be carefully chosen. “We don't play Cluedo any more because you struggle with cheating,” says Chloe. When Cara is in&#xa0;town from LA, “she makes us play Sardines”, says Poppy, “and more extreme, wild games”, adds Chloe. With friends, music is the main event. “Late night, it's always Disney – singalong,” says Poppy. The sisters all have set duets and favoured routines: <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>, <em>Aladdin</em> and the Spice Girls. “Usually at that point everyone's leaving. And it will just be us, till dawn!” says Poppy. </p><p>Source: Baya Simons.
