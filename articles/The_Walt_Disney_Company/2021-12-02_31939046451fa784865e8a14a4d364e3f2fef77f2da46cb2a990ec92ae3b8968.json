  "text": "<p>The other Farley was white and rotund. I'm Black and 6'5\". It used to annoy me that I've had to share my name with a comedian, even one as undeniably charismatic and talented as that other Farley. But things are changing.</p><p>Establishing an identity on the internet is an increasingly precious and contentious matter for celebrities, politicians, corporations and regular people. Nobody likes being MattSmith287 on social media. Fifty years ago, if you had a fairly distinctive name, you might never cross paths with someone with the exact same moniker. Sure, you might be in a homeroom with a gaggle of Gregs or a pack of Penelopes, but once you gave your surname, or even just the first letter of your last name, everyone knew exactly who you were.</p><p>Now, if we Google ourselves, we get pages of results for people who share our names but not our faces. On Wikipedia, my name is linked via hypertext to that other Farley. The top of his Wikipedia page reads \"For the journalist and author, see Christopher John Farley.\" The top of mine reads, \"For the comedian and actor, see Chris Farley.\" And no, I did not edit either page.</p><p>I first stumbled upon the other Farley's name more than 30 years ago in a magazine article on up-and-coming comics. I had been an editor for the Harvard Lampoon, and when I first became aware of the other Farley, I was writing a satirical novel. I realized that with another person out there working in comedy and sharing my name, I was facing a serious branding issue.</p><p>Sure enough, people started mixing us up. Once somebody mistakenly sent me a script that was meant for the other Farley for \"Coneheads,\" a movie then in development based on the \"SNL\" skit. When I was working as a journalist for Time magazine, security guards at 30 Rockefeller Plaza wouldn't let me up to see Chris Rock because they thought I was joking when I told them who I was. I started getting double-takes when waiters saw my credit card. They would always say something like \"You know there's a comedian with the same name, right?\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you ever been confused with someone else who has the same name? Join the conversation below.</p><p>When the other Farley died of a drug overdose on Dec. 18, 1997, I was saddened, but I thought I'd get my name back. But in a John Belushi kind of way, dying youngish helped the other Farley's fame live on. He was no longer just another comedian who churned out modestly reviewed films like \"Tommy Boy\" and \"Beverly Hills Ninja.\" He had become a tragic clown, a kind of madcap martyr. Now I didn't just have to compete with the other Farley's life, I had to compete with his death.</p><p>More and more, pop culture is embracing the idea that there are multiple copies of all of us. In the coming DC movie \"The Flash,\" the superfast superhero will reportedly have run-ins with different versions of himself. In the recent Marvel series \"Loki\" on Disney+, the title character had a series of encounters with his variants, including one who was an alligator. The upcoming Marvel movies \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" and \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" are expected to explore the idea that we live in a multiverse filled with iterations of ourselves who share our names but are slightly or drastically different.</p><p>Some of this is marketing: Operating in a multiverse allows entertainment companies to blend TV, movie and comic book properties. But the serious social and technological issue here is how to navigate a real world in which we share our names on social media and the internet with countless other people.</p><p>I tried to take back my name, or some variation of it. My byline used to be Chris Farley, and then I changed it to Christopher John Farley. More recently I've been writing young adult books under the name C.J. Farley, mostly because having a name that's longer than the title of the novel seemed pretentious.</p><p>There's a line from the Chinese philosopher Laozi that gave me some comfort. It roughly goes: \"If no credit is taken, no credit can be taken away.\" I used to think sharing a name was like sharing a pair of boxer briefs. Sure, it can be done, but to what end? Now I think it's more like sharing an Uber. Everyone can still get to wherever they're going. And only jerks complain about the stops along the way.</p><p>I never did get to talk to the other Farley before he died. But I feel like I've been in a kind of dialogue with his life for decades. Before his fatal overdose, the other Farley was set to star as the voice of \"Shrek,\" but after his passing the role went to his \"SNL\" co-star Mike Myers, who turned the part into a franchise. I felt like the other Chris Farley was sending me a signal from the grave: \"Don't waste your shot to make your name.\" The fact that I was hearing this message in my head in a Shrek voice was a little funny and a little sad at the same time.</p><p>I'm now at peace with occasionally getting mixed up with that other Farley. He's clearly much more famous than I am, and he's clearly much more dead. I just hope I can live up to the name we share.</p><p>Mr. Farley is the author of the young adult book \"Zero O'Clock.\"</p><p>Will the Real Chris Farley Please Stand Up?</p>",
