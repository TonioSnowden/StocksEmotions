  "title": "Disney Appoints Carolyn Everson, a Veteran Media Executive, to Board; Appointment comes after activist investor Daniel Loeb demanded that Disney 'refresh' its board",
  "text": "<p>She will join Disney's board, effective Nov. 21, and will be included in the company's slate of directors in its 2023 proxy statement, Disney said Friday.</p><p>As part of the agreement for her to join the board, Mr. Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point LLC, has agreed to a standstill, meaning the fund won't propose its own slate of directors at Disney's next annual meeting.</p><p>Adding a board member during the course of the fiscal year is unusual for a big company like Disney. Changes to the board typically occur as part of the annual meeting.</p><p>\"We are pleased with our productive and ongoing dialogue with Bob and Disney's management team,\" Mr. Loeb said in a statement Friday, adding that Ms. Everson, who previously was chief operating officer of media giant Viacom, added an important new perspective to the board.</p><p>In August, Mr. Loeb announced that Third Point had taken a new stake in Disney's stock after having liquidated a position earlier this year. Mr. Loeb sent a letter to the company on Aug. 15 asking Disney to make a slate of changes, including spinning off sports network ESPN, buying the remaining one-third stake in streaming service Hulu that it doesn't currently own from Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal and adding board members with more experience in digital ads and consumer data.</p><p>Mr. Loeb later backed off his demand that ESPN be spun off, writing on Twitter that he had gained a better understanding of ESPN's potential as a stand-alone business compared to remaining a part of Disney, but said his other suggestions still stand.</p><p>In the August letter, Mr. Loeb wrote that his fund had identified potential directors that it would be satisfied with and offered to introduce them to Disney leadership. Mr. Loeb, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether Ms. Everson's name was on his list of potential board members. Disney said she was identified after a lengthy and comprehensive search.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney Appoints Carolyn Everson, a Veteran Media Executive, to Board</p>",
