In recent days Russia has repeated claims over chemical and biological weapons, raising fears in the west that Putin is preparing to deploy unconventional weapons.</p> <p>Russia has requested a meeting of the UN Security Council later today to discuss allegations that the US has funded unconventional weapons research in Ukraine.
