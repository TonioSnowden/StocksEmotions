  "title": "A Moneyball Experiment in Soccer --- With the second-lowest payroll in England's second tier, Barnsley FC is hoping to reach the Premier League",
  "text": "<p>But on the ground in South Yorkshire, he and Barnsley's American backers have been playing a long game. Rather than running a juggernaut, they're working with one of the smallest budgets in the division at a team that has spent all of one season in the top tier in its 134-year history.</p><p>If the club manages to secure a second through the Championship playoffs, which begin on Monday, it will be down to one of the more radical squad-building experiments that English soccer has ever seen. With an approach based on a pair of high-performing algorithms, Barnsley is one of the rare teams in Europe to earn more from player trading than it spends. Its roster has just four players over 25.</p><p>And when Billy Beane, the data revolutionary who turned around the Oakland A's in the early 2000s, happens to be one of the club's silent owners, Murphy knows what people are going to call his project.</p><p>\"If it's using data to cut away the fat, cut out the white noise, in our approach to the financial model and the recruiting model, then yes, it is Moneyball,\" Murphy says. \"But the nuances of it, of course, are different.\"</p><p>As richer clubs than Barnsley have discovered, philosophy is often a luxury. Teams want to play a certain way, only to blow up the plan for something more pragmatic once things start to go wrong. The existential threat of relegation -- and the financial turmoil it causes inside a club -- is simply too great.</p><p>\"There are so many different ways the bottom can fall out,\" says Murphy, who has had a front-row seat to the dramatic bankruptcies of clubs in the North of England, like Bury and Bolton in recent years.</p><p>So he knows that English soccer's second-tier might just be the most stressful division in sports. At one end, the 46-game grind can open the door to the promised land of the Premier League, with the nine-figure cash rewards just for showing up. At the other, is a trapdoor into lower leagues and a financial insecurity that few owners ever recover from.</p><p>It also brings together a range of clubs with vastly different resources. And in a sport where few things correlate more closely with league position than payroll, Barnsley should have no business fighting for promotion to the Premier League.</p><p>Teams who have recently spent time in the top tier -- and developed a taste for the high life -- are still paying players in the neighborhood of GBP 100,000 ($141,000) a week, Murphy said. There are starters at Barnsley, meanwhile, on less than 2% of that, at GBP 1,500 a week. The entire roster costs considerably under $10 million a season. Only Wycombe Wanderers are operating with less in the Championship, as the second tier is known.</p><p>\"The stratosphere that some of these guys are in financially, we can't ever wish to get close to,\" Murphy added. \"Our approach at the club has to be completely different from the norm, or else there's no chance we can compete.\"</p><p>If that sounds familiar for a soccer team in the post-Moneyball era, it's because so many have tried and failed. Liverpool's American owners, for instance, had arrived in England in 2010 hoping to apply Beane's principles and learned the hard way that major success also happened to require piles of money.</p><p>The difference is that Barnsley was prepared to absorb the bad times. By imposing a rigid financial structure on itself, it set out to guarantee above else that the club continued existing. Everything else could come later.</p><p>Selling that to the fans can be complicated. Especially when you try to explain that the Barnsley venture is part of a larger, pan-European plan with the strings being pulled from across the Atlantic. The team belongs to a consortium put together by the Chinese-American businessman Chien Lee and his company Pacific Media Group, who have put together a portfolio of clubs across five countries.</p><p>Unlike the huge soccer multinationals led by Manchester City and Red Bull, who believe their rivals are Disney and Amazon rather than other soccer teams, PMG focuses on much more modest outfits. Those clubs are in Esbjerg in Denmark, Nancy in France, Oostende in Belgium, and Thun in Switzerland. Barnsley -- population 240,000 -- is twice as big as any of them.</p><p>\"It's quite a socialist area. So overseas capitalists coming in and taking over your club, it doesn't really fit with the ethos,\" says Simon Biltcliffe, chairman of the Barnsley-affiliated charity called Reds in the Community, of his hometown in Britain's historic coal-mining country. \"But it is a fact of life.\"</p><p>Biltcliffe and others, however, have been pleasantly surprised. Barnsley's approach has delivered them a young, hungry team under managers they've never heard of, and their highest league finish this century. And they've learned that everything starts with the two algorithms that are transforming their club.</p><p>One was developed by the son of the former owner over the course of the past four years. The other comes from Beane's consulting group, which serves an advisory role. Both are closely guarded -- Barnsley's entire economic model depends on it. (Beane didn't respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>That's how Barnsley knew that they were onto something when Murphy learned that a kid he had watched at his alma mater, the University of Virginia, might be available midway through the season. Just 20 years old, Daryl Dike fit closely enough with Barnsley's modeling that the club felt he might just have what it takes to leap from Orlando City in Major League Soccer to the rough-and-tumble Championship.</p><p>After a last-minute loan deal, Dike boarded a flight to the U.K. for the first time in his life midway through the season. As it turned out, Dike was precisely the piece Barnsley's hard-running, always suffocating approach had been missing. The team doesn't build around keeping the ball -- it ranked 17th in the Championship in possession this year -- but focuses instead on forcing turnovers high up the field and capitalizing on mistakes.</p><p>When Dike arrived, Barnsley had been in 12th place. Nineteen games and nine goals later, the club was in fifth with a berth in the playoffs.</p><p>\"We've climbed the table and we have momentum because of our style of play,\" Dike said. \"Being able to stress opponents. Being able to play a constant press.\"</p><p>Which certainly beats where Barnsley was this time last year. The club escaped relegation from the Championship with a 91st minute goal on the final day of the season. Barnsley breathed a collective sigh of relief when they were saved, but Murphy and the fans now understand that those moments come with the experiment.</p><p>\"If you try to tiptoe around the hard truths,\" Murphy says, \"they're going to see right through you.\"</p>",
