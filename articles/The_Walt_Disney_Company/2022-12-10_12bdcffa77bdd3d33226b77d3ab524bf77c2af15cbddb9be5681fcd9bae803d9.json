  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Brad Pitt's Production Company Sells Stake to French Conglomerate",
  "text": "<p>Many of the recent deals have involved production companies affiliated with big stars.</p><p>Last year, Candle Media, the private equity-backed entertainment company run by former Disney executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, acquired actress Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine, the production company behind the \"The Morning Show\" on Apple TV+.</p><p>That deal was valued at about $900 million.</p><p>Candle Media earlier this year purchased a minority stake in Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's entertainment company, Westbrook, which has backed projects including \"King Richard,\" a biopic chronicling the life of Richard Williams.</p><p>Such deals may become more difficult to close in the current environment, as entertainment companies ranging from Warner Bros Discovery Inc. to Paramount Global are cutting costs amid macroeconomic uncertainty, large streaming losses and an acceleration in cord-cutting.</p><p>Mediawan didn't disclose the valuation of the deal. The Wall Street Journal in October reported that Plan B was exploring strategic options, including a possible sale of part of the company.</p><p>CNBC on Friday reported that a Plan B stake was going to be sold to Mediawan.</p><p>Founded in 2015, Paris-based Mediawan controls several distribution and production companies across Europe, which have backed projects including \"Call My Agent!,\" a comedy about a French talent agency, and \"The Life Ahead,\" an Italian movie starring Sophia Loren.</p><p>By joining forces with Plan B, Mediawan is expanding beyond its core European markets into the U.S., the companies said Friday.</p><p>Plan B, which is run by Mr. Pitt and film producers Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, has been involved in a number of critically acclaimed movies.</p><p>Some of its recent projects include \"Women Talking,\" a religious drama scheduled for theatrical release later this year, and the Marilyn Monroe biopic \"Blonde\" on Netflix.</p>",
