  "text": "<p>   NBCUniversal said former Hulu chief Kelly Campbell would become president of Peacock, a year-old streaming platform that parent company Comcast Corp. is looking to build into a powerhouse. </p><p>   The move comes after Ms. Campbell resigned on Monday from her role as president of Walt Disney Co.'s Hulu streaming service. The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported Ms. Campbell was in discussions to join NBCUniversal. </p><p>   Ms. Campbell will start in November and will report to Matt Strauss, chairman of NBCUniversal's direct-to-consumer and international division, the company said Wednesday. She is succeeding Gidon Katz, who resigned from his role as NBCUniversal's president of the direct-to-consumer division last week. </p><p>   \"On the heels of Peacock's success in its first year, we are thrilled to bring Kelly's leadership and expertise to the team as we continue to accelerate Peacock's vision and strategy,\" Mr. Strauss said. </p><p>   Peacock is looking to boost its platform with more subscribers and content. Comcast in July said Peacock had 54 million sign-ups and 20 million monthly active accounts, but has yet to reveal how many of those pay for the service. A version of Peacock is free to everyone, and existing Comcast subscribers have access to the ad-supported Premium version at no additional cost. </p><p>   Peacock, which was launched last year, has fewer subscribers and a much smaller library than many of its competitors, analysts have said. </p><p>   In July, NBCUniversal used the Tokyo Summer Olympics as a way to relaunch Peacock. The platform offered direct coverage of nearly all the competitions and a library of original programs, such as a highlights program with comedian Kevin Hart and hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg. </p><p></p>",
