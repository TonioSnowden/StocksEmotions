  "text": "<p>Airline traffic surged last month as passengers resumed travelling to ahead of the rollout of the European Union's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d48a006-cdfa-4b27-a663-21428471fbc5\">Digital Covid Certificate</a>.</p> <p>Ryanair said it carried 5.3m passengers in June, up from just 400,000 a year earlier. Its load factor — the percentage of available seating capacity occupied — was 72 per cent. </p> <p>For the fiscal first quarter ended June Ryanair reported carrying 8.1m passengers in total and a load factor of 73 per cent. Speaking on Bloomberg Television, chief executive Michael O'Leary said the company is seeing a “very strong recovery in bookings” for inter-European travel. </p> <p>Wizz Air said it carried just under 1.6m passengers in June, from around 500,000 a year before, at a load factor of 64 per cent.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> has unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f63f2e06-ce1e-41ca-b4ca-66d7b0be0a51\">series of reforms</a> designed to boost the City of London's global pull for share trading and listings, following the loss of business after Brexit. The chancellor on Thursday set out details of proposed changes to rules governing stock market listings, stock, bond and commodity trading and insurance, underscoring the UK's willingness to split from the EU rule book it had once helped write.</p> <p>Video games developer <strong>Team17</strong> agreed to buy StoryToys, a maker of apps aimed at children under the age of eight for partners including Lego, Disney, Pixar and Nickelodeon. Team17 agreed to pay $26.5m cash for StoryToys with a further maximum $22.5m payable based on three-year performance targets. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The Gym Group</strong> raised £31.2m with a share placing to accelerate rollout plans with a target of 40 new openings in the next 18 months, with scope in the longer term to double the size of its current estate of 187 gyms. The company said it had sold new shares at 275p apiece versus Thursday's closing level of 285p.</p> <p>Aim-quoted <strong>Omega Diagnostics</strong> said its technology partner Mologic&#xa0;has filed a submission&#xa0;to the US Food and Drug Administration requesting emergency use authorisation for the companies'&#xa0;rapid point-of-care Covid-19 antigen test.</p> <p><strong>CMO Group</strong>, an online-only retailer of building materials, will join Aim with a market value of £95m after completing an initial share sale. The company raised approximately £45m at 132p apiece to provide long-term funding, reduce debt and restructure its balance sheet.</p> <p>More than twice as many FTSE 100 companies have faced a <strong>shareholder pay revolt</strong> this year than last, as investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c88df29-3c7e-45a5-938a-3db5dad04cae\">attacked managements</a> seen to be profiting during a tough 12 months for many in the pandemic. So-called low votes — of less than 80 per cent of shareholders — in favour of annual remuneration reports have risen to 12 per cent in 2021 so far, from 5 per cent in 2020, according to an analysis by Deloitte.</p> <p>UK pension schemes are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cb0c425-dc46-40bc-ac13-9284a27da8a5\">wasting billions of pounds</a> each year paying fees to <strong>underperforming asset managers</strong>, according to a Financial Conduct Authority study that highlights the weak value for money delivered to retirement savers.</p> <p>The secretive process to elect the <strong>lord mayor of London</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1654cda-23e7-4867-b018-bc4dfe242184\">thrown into disarray</a> after senior officials in the City raised questions over whether one of the leading candidates was eligible for the role. Nick Lyons, chair of the insurer Phoenix, is one of the final two candidates seeking to become lord mayor in 2022 but his application has led to objections from some City leaders after they discovered that he holds an Irish passport. They believe the rules require the lord mayor to be a British subject.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Qinetiq</strong> chief financial officer David Smith will retire at the end of November, the defence technology group said. His successor will be Carol Borg, currently chief financial officer of solar developer Lightsource BP.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The world's leading economies have signed up <a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-d0311794-abcf-4a2a-a8a4-bcabfc4f71fa/NN9OE-6PfcAsiqn4gC_xwQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiwScVP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvZDAzMTE3OTQtYWJjZi00YTJhLWE4YTQtYmNhYmZjNGY3MWZhP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBkZTllN2NhZmJkYzEwMDA0OTBhMDZhJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpg3UGi3mDnTgb8UhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">to a plan</a>&#xa0;to force multinational companies to pay a <strong>global minimum corporate tax</strong> rate of at least 15 per cent following negotiations at the OECD in Paris.

The activist hedge fund is skilled at reputation leverage but without substantive objections to the turnround plan, its lobbying to strengthen management is a sideshow.</p> <p><strong>Merryn Somerset Webb</strong> <br>Any fund managers interested in value <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5ae725e-509e-477b-89bf-7a2feb968c86\">have a problem</a>. Buying what look like cheap stocks and waiting for them to go up without correctly calculating the odds of the arrival of a private equity bid or similar catalyst can present a material career risk.
