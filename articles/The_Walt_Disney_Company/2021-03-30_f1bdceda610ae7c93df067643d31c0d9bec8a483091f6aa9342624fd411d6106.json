  "text": "<p>German media group Bertelsmann is pushing to create a national television champion in France, seeking to convince regulators to allow a potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d71083a-4f0d-437f-ad64-e5bec060e6ba\">combination of its M6 station</a> with the broadcaster's main commercial rival TF1. </p> <p>Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann chief executive and chair, told the Financial Times he was “primarily interested” in using France as a testing ground for national media consolidation as he reviewed options for its 48 per cent stake in M6, held through broadcasting business RTL. </p> <p>“In France maybe the route is via consolidation with TF1,” he said, referring to the Bouygues-owned commercial market leader in France. “But that doesn't mean selling our shares. We would be part of the consolidation, and with all modesty, we would be the driving force. There's an incredibly strong case for consolidation.”</p> <p>The process to potentially sell or merge M6, which Rabe started earlier this year as chief executive of RTL, is one of a series of deals that could reshape ownership of France's main TV and radio outlets before next year's presidential election. </p> <p>A battle for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4be3bc2a-a2d7-4a7b-a842-a1b9c3896ee9\">control of Lagardère</a>, which owns influential newspaper and radio assets, is also ongoing involving Vincent&#xa0;Bolloré&#xa0;and Bernard Arnault, France's richest men.</p> <p>Rabe cast the M6 auction as a turning point for “an analogue” regulatory framework for Europe's media sector, with competition enforcement failing to keep pace with the transformation in advertising markets and the rise of US streaming giants such as Netflix and Disney.</p> <p>“We are not naive. The barriers are very significant. The regulatory framework . . . is quite simply not adapted to new reality,” he said. “I'm prepared to take up this challenge, and discuss it with the competition authority on the basis of a specific consolidation proposal. That's what we want to do.”</p> <p>M6 is the second-biggest private broadcaster in France after Bouygues' TF1, and it also owns the RTL radio station in France, which has a large audience. </p> <p>Rabe's move has already attracted multiple bidders including Bolloré's Vivendi, Bouygues' TF1 and a consortium led by telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel. Other expressions of interest have included Italy's Mediaset and Daniel Kretinsky, the Czech billionaire and part-owner of Le Monde with Niel.</p> <p>Asked whether he was more interested in a merger than an outright sale of M6, Rabe replied: “If at the end of the process, our assessment is the consolidation is unlikely to go through because of regulatory hurdles, then we will of course be open-minded and look at alternatives. The interest in M6 is huge.”</p> <p>Rabe spoke to the FT on the day Bertelsmann released its results for 2020, a record year for the family-owned group. Strong performance by its Penguin Random House books division helped Bertelsmann record a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to €1.9bn. Revenues fell 4.1 per cent to €17.2bn, hit by the advertising slump after the coronavirus lockdowns.</p> <p>Rabe said he was determined to press on with any M6 deal before the presidential elections next year, and cast the future of the stake as critical to determining whether other national tie-ups would be possible between commercial rivals in Europe. </p> <p>“Over the last 50 years, effectively nothing has happened in consolidation in Europe. Nothing,” he said. “Nothing happened while the competitive landscape changed radically — look at the advertising market in Europe. Everything has changed.”</p> <p>Many analysts have cast doubt on the prospects of a deal with TF1, pointing out it would need to overturn the longstanding method of market analysis used by the French competition authority. </p> <p>“We believe the deal is unlikely,” said Julien Roch of Barclays in a note earlier this month. “It hinges on whether the Conseil de la Concurrence believes the relevant market is television advertising (71 per cent market share) or total advertising (16 per cent market share).” But he noted the deal could in theory pass if French politicians swung behind the idea. </p> <p>Rabe said “we are hearing exactly the right things” from regulators and politicians who want a national champion to “help protect the national cultural sovereignty”. “But . . . one thing is what you are told and the other thing, of course, [is] how the authorities then look at the specific proposal.”</p> <p>With so many influential French businessmen vying for M6, executives are aware the auction could easily be derailed by politics as President Emmanuel Macron seeks re-election. </p><p>Source: Alex Barker in London and Leila Abboud in Goult 2021 'Bertelsmann aims for new national TV champion in France' FT.com 30 March.
