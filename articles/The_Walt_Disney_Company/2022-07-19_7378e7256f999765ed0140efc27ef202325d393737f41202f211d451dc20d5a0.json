  "title": "Netflix Plays to its Remaining Crowd; Streaming giant keeps losing subscribers in key markets but strongly hints it won't mess with its 'binge' model",
  "text": "<p>Still, the results made clear that Netflix continues to face significant challenges. The streaming pioneer has lost a total of 3 million subscribers during the first half of the year in its two largest markets of the U.S./Canada and Europe. They account for three-quarters of the company's revenue. Netflix also projected adding 1 million net new subscribers in the third quarterâ€”well below the 2.3 million expected by Wall Street, despite the fact that it broke up the release of the latest season of its mega-popular \"Stranger Things\" series to have the last two episodes drop at the beginning of the current quarter.</p><p>That sort of stunt doesn't seem destined to become a thing. In its quarterly letter to shareholders Tuesday, Netflix touted the so-called binge release model that it pioneered for TV series, arguing that a \"focus on choice and control for members influences all aspects of our strategy, creating what we believe to be a significant long-term business advantage.\"</p><p>It also noted that the cumulative volume of Twitter mentions for \"Stranger Things,\" which outpaced those of Disney's \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" series and the box-office smash \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" also reinforced the value of its binge release strategy.</p><p>That suggests Netflix isn't scrapping its entire playbook yet in the interest of reinvigorating subscriber growth. Following its disastrous first-quarter report, the company did a rapid about-face on both advertising and account-sharing. It now plans launches next year for both an ad-supported tier as well as a \"paid sharing\" offering that will charge users more who share their accounts with people outside their households. Both will likely take time to grow to a level that helps the company's revenue in any significant way.</p><p>Netflix will need to keep its binge watchers well-fed until then.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Plays to its Remaining Crowd</p>",
