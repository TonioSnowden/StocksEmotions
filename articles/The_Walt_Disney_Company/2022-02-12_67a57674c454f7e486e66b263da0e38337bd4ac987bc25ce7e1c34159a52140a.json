  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  SEC Move Helps Shareholder Voices Grow Louder  ----  By Richard Vanderford",
  "text": "<p>   A Walt Disney Co. shareholder wants the board to study the company's workplace training, arguing it could discriminate against white employees. A shareholder in Apple Inc. is asking for a public report on the corporation's use of mandatory arbitration and other legal tools in dealing with sexual-harassment claims. </p><p>   In the past, such shareholder proposals could have been easily swept aside, never making it to a vote at a company's annual meeting. But the Securities and Exchange Commission in November overturned several mechanisms that companies routinely use to shoot down shareholder proposals, and specified that shareholders were allowed to press companies on issues of broad social importance. </p><p>   As environmental, social and governance issues gain more prominence, the SEC's move allows shareholders to shine an unwelcome spotlight on U.S. corporations as they head into the busy proxy season. </p><p>   The SEC's guidance change \"was unexpected by the corporate bar,\" said Stephen Quinlivan, a partner at law firm Stinson LLP who advises companies on SEC reporting matters. </p><p>   Public corporations have for decades faced shareholder proposals that are voted on at annual meetings. </p><p>   Companies can normally exclude proposals that touch too closely on their ordinary business, the logic being that management is better equipped than shareholders to solve day-to-day issues. But the SEC said that proposals on major social issues that \"transcend\" normal business can't be excluded. </p><p>   The SEC also said it would be less ready to accept arguments that shareholder proposals constituted impermissible \"micromanagement.\" </p><p>   It is too early to tell how the SEC might apply its more permissive guidance, Mr. Quinlivan said. But the latest proposals suggest some issues companies might face. </p><p>   The SEC-permitted proposal directed at Apple, for example, highlighted a persistent area of concern: the extent to which companies have sought to handle sexual-harassment complaints by pushing employees into closed-door sessions. </p><p>   The Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would bar companies from forcing employees and customers into arbitration to address claims of sexual assault and harassment. The House passed its own version of the bill and the legislation now heads to President Biden's desk. </p><p>   An Apple spokesman said the company didn't have anything to add beyond what it said in its proxy statement, which contains the proposal along with a recommendation from Apple to vote against it. </p><p>   The proposal directed at Disney comes from a shareholder -- the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank -- which argued that the company's antiracism training discriminates against white employees. The SEC rejected Disney's arguments that the proposal could be excluded from its proxy statement. </p><p>   Disney didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   The full impact of the regulatory shift will be seen in coming weeks as SEC staff sift through company requests to exclude shareholder proposals, said Sonia Gupta Barros, who chairs the public company advisory group at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. </p><p>   \"This was a really significant shift,\" Ms. Barros said. Some companies have looked at the new guidance and decided not to fight shareholders on resolutions they might have contested in the past, she added. </p><p></p>",
