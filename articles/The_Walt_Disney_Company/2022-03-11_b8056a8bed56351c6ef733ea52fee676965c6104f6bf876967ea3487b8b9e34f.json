  "title": "Arts in Review -- Film Review -- 'Turning Red': Showing Your True Colors",
  "text": "<p>One of the charms of \"Bao\" was the absence of dialogue; it was shot like a silent film. \"Turning Red\" is a talkie all the way, with a heroine w ho's a chatterbox laureate except when she's serving as assistant temple keeper at a small Buddhist temple in the neighborhood. Mei can't stop gushing about a dorky convenience-store clerk she adores from afar. Like her three antic girlfriends, she talks compulsively about scoring tickets to see a superlatively self-enchanted boy band, 4*Town, that's coming to Toronto to kick off its North American tour. (The band is fictional, but its songs were written by Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell.)</p><p>Something else colors Mei's life as the film gathers force. She discovers to her horror, and our delight, that whenever her emotions get the best of her she turns into a huge red panda.</p><p>It's a family thing, as it turns out, an affliction -- or an inconvenience, to use her mother's term -- that goes back through generations of women to an ancient ancestor. The concept obviously evokes \"The Hulk,\" not to mention the Hulk's ancient ancestors, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but with a difference that transcends Panda red and Hulk green. The transformation -- which occurs for the first time behind a closed bathroom door, accompanied by screams that Ming hilariously mistakes for the arrival of her daughter's menarche -- isn't prompted only by rage. Mei's panda pops out in response to any kind of excitement, including the anxiety, frustration, full-bore anger and irrepressible glee that get the best of many teens during most of their waking hours. It's a lovely comedic device -- and Ms. Shi and her animation colleagues know how to make the most of it -- but also a strong metaphor for breaking the traditional bonds of repression that will be familiar to daughters from families the world over.</p><p>Ever since Disney consigned Pixar's \"Soul,\" and then \"Luca,\" to streaming on its premium platform without a theatrical release, there's been reason to fear the downgrading of a brand that has served for almost three decades as the movie industry's gold standard of quality. \"Turning Red\" won't play in theaters either, except for a special engagement at Disney's flagship El Capitan on Hollywood Boulevard. That's a pity for a film that would have looked great on a big screen, but it's a top-drawer Pixar production all the same -- specific in its cultural details, and valuable at a time when people of Asian descent are once again victims of hate crimes, yet universal in its emotional range and comedic appeal.</p><p>That range is remarkably wide, and sometimes startling. At one extreme is an exquisitely tender exchange between Mei and her father, Jin (Orion Lee), who has seemed, until that point, to be as detached from her life as he is taciturn. At the other is a spectacular, fiercely funny exorcism organized by Mei's grandmother (she's voiced by Wai Ching Ho), who frames the ritual as Mei's chance to banish the beast within and finally become her true self. It is that and much more, a tumultuous, intricate and sporadically mystical set piece interwoven with the 4*Town concert that Mei had yearned to attend. The climax as a whole is cheerfully chaotic, if not over the top, but who cares about perfection when a movie is as good as this one?</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
