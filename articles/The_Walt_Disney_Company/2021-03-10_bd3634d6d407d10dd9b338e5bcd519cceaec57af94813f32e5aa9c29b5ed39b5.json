  "text": "<p>Powered by fan favorites like \"The Mandalorian\" and \"WandaVision,\" the service is on track to meet the company's projection of 260 million subscribers by 2024. The company last reported 94.9 million subscribers as of Jan. 2.</p><p>Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek reiterated at a shareholder meeting Tuesday that the company's streaming strategy is his priority, noting that Disney has set a bullish target of adding more than 100 new titles to the service each year. Leading streaming platform Netflix said in January that it had 203.7 million subscribers.</p><p>Disney's torrential growth, which has been faster than at rivals such as Amazon Prime Video, speaks to the company's accidental timing in releasing a new service months before nationwide shutdown orders, as well as its strategy to ship new programming to the service as needed so viewers stay engaged week to week. Disney+ launched with a massive library of movies and TV shows that has played a large role in hooking families -- and an introductory price of $6.99 a month, considerably less expensive than other services. (It will start costing $7.99 a month later this year.)</p><p>The company's original-programming strategy has relied on fan-favorite hits such as \"The Mandalorian,\" a Star Wars spinoff that premiered when the service launched in November 2019 and offered it its first viral star in the creature known by fans as \"Baby Yoda.\" When Covid-19 shut down U.S. theaters, Disney shipped theatrical releases such as \"Hamilton\" to the service, which provided subscription bumps and played a critical role in convincing viewers to keep paying their monthly fee. Wall Street has remained focused on Disney's streaming plans, a company reorientation that has sent Disney shares to records.</p><p>Only 45% of North American movie theaters are currently open, though Disney reiterated that it expects to give a theatrical release to its Marvel Studios superhero film \"Black Widow\" when it comes out in May.</p><p>Disney is exploring different strategies in various markets to maintain its subscriber growth, including an option in some overseas territories to couple Disney+ with more adult-oriented programming available on its Star platform.</p><p>Questions loom about the future of Disney+, particularly in how aggressively Mr. Chapek decides to use it to shake up theatrical distribution.</p>",
