  "title": "Disney World, Disneyland Push Prices Higher; Cost of Genie+ climbs for visitors who want to bypass popular rides' standby waits",
  "text": "<p>Budgeting for a Disney theme-park vacation just became a bit more complicated.</p><p>Disney raised the pricing for its Genie+ service, which allows visitors to Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Resort in California to skip the lengthy standby waits for popular rides. Now, the service's cost will vary day to day, based on how crowded the parks are.</p><p>The Genie+ changes accompany others at Disneyland Resort, including increases to the cost of admission and add-ons such as valet parking.</p><p>Genie+ was launched in fall 2021, replacing the free FastPass system. Originally, buying Genie+ for a day cost $15 a person plus tax at Walt Disney World and $20 a person plus tax at Disneyland.</p><p>At Walt Disney World, Genie+ will cost between $15 and $22, depending on the popularity of a given day, during the month of October. That pricing is subject to change beyond this month, a spokesman for Disney World said, and the price could be higher at peak times such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p><p>Since Genie+ was launched at Disney World last year, 10 attractions have been added to the service, a spokesman said, including Space Mountain at Magic Kingdom and Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at Epcot.</p><p>Disney World guests can't pay for Genie+ ahead of their visit, and they will only know the pricing of the service when it is available for purchase each day of their trip.</p><p>At Disneyland, visitors can choose to purchase Genie+ for $25 a person in advance. Those who purchase Genie+ on the day of their visit will see demand-based pricing, the company said, though it didn't disclose the price range for the service.</p><p>Since its debut, Genie+has become a cash cow for Disney's parks, experiences and products division. It has helped the company's U.S. parks reach record profits. Disney previously reported that about half of the visitors to its parks paid for the service, adding that a majority of those who did said they would opt to do so again in post-visit surveys.</p><p>At Disneyland Resort, the updates to Genie+ were part of a broader slate of pricing changes. The cost of multiday tickets for Disneyland rose at least 9%. The price of two-day tickets rose the most, from $255 per adult to $285, an increase of nearly 12%.</p><p>Single-day tickets to Disneyland are variably priced across several tiers. With the changes, Disney added a seventh tier for single-day ticket prices. The lowest-cost ticket remains $104, which has been the case since 2019. The most expensive ticket now costs $179, a rise of roughly 9%.</p><p>\"Our tiered ticketing structure offers guests different options to experience that magic throughout the year,\" a Disneyland spokeswoman said in an email.</p><p>Certain add-ons also increased in price at Disneyland. Hotel valet now costs $65, up from $50, and preferred parking is now $50, up $5.</p><p>At Disney World, prices are now higher for Star Wars-themed experiences where visitors can build a custom droid or lightsaber, a spokesman for the company said. Disney World also increased prices for food and drink items across its theme parks.</p><p>Write to Jacob Passy at jacob.passy@wsj.com</p><p>Disney World, Disneyland Push Prices Higher</p>",
