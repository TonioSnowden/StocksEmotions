Join the conversation below.</p><p>The world's largest entertainment company posted $21.82 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared with $16.25 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the company to report revenue of $20.27 billion.</p><p>Sales at its theme parks and consumer products division—which includes Walt Disney World and Disneyland resorts—were $7.23 billion, buoyed by increasing strength in outdoor travel. Analysts expected $6.36 billion. The company said its domestic parks and resorts reported record revenue and operating income.</p><p>Wednesday's results were Disney's first earnings report since longtime executive Robert Iger left the company as executive chairman at the end of December. Disney named Susan Arnold as his successor.</p><p>Shares of Disney rose 8.6% in after-hours trading. The stock closed Wednesday at $147.23, up 3.3%.</p><p>Disney's biggest streaming rival, Netflix Inc., last month said it added 8.3 million subscribers, fewer than investors had expected, and ratcheted down its estimates for growth. Netflix shares fell 20% in after-hours trading the day it reported weaker-than-expected subscriber growth.</p><p>Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said in November that the company is still on track to reach around 260 million streaming customers by the end of fiscal 2024.</p><p>Investors have punished Disney because of slowing subscriber growth. The company's share price has fallen about 30% from highs of nearly $202 reached in March 2021. Shares are down about 8% since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Last quarter, Mr. Chapek said he expected that a stream of new shows and films out in the second half of 2022 would help reboot demand for Disney+. Those include the spy thriller series \"Andor,\" the superhero miniseries \"Ms. Marvel\" and a live action reboot of \"Pinocchio.\"</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com and Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com</p><p>Disney+ Subscriptions Near 130 Million, Beating Expectations</p>",
