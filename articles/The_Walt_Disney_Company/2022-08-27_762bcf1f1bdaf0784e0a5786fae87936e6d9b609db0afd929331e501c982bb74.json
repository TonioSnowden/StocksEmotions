  "text": "<p>It was, even for the histrionic discourse of the boxing ring, a memorable threat. “I want to eat his children,” said Mike Tyson at the end of his 38-second fight with Lou Savarese in 2000, after being asked what he thought of his next opponent, the British boxer Lennox Lewis. Pumped sky-high with adrenaline, he resorted to the basest of boasts: “I'm the most brutal and vicious, the most ruthless champion there's ever been. There's no one can stop me.”</p> <p>As it happens, Lewis won their bout, held two years later, in relatively comfortable style, knocking out Tyson in the eighth round. Tyson was decent and dignified in defeat, his deranged outburst largely forgotten. The bout grossed more than $100mn, a then record for pay-per-view receipts. Tyson only won one more fight after the defeat to Lewis. In 2003 he filed for bankruptcy. By then he had already served a jail sentence for rape, bitten off part of the ear of an opponent and become addicted to drugs. In the end, Tyson stopped himself.</p> <p>In <em>Mike</em>, a new television mini-series, Tyson's ascent and disgrace are given nuance by a framing device, showing the now retired boxer reflecting on his earlier life in the form of a public lecture. “Is that who I am?” he asks his audience, having recounted the biting episode from his fight with Evander Holyfield. “Yeah. No.” We are asked, in Trevante Rhodes's compelling performance, not so much to suspend judgment as to deliver it with a broader perspective on Tyson's turbulent upbringing and the politics of race.</p> <p>Tyson's childhood — he was abandoned by his father and brought up by an uncaring mother — was lacking in love and largely spent in criminal activity (38 arrests by the age of 13). Caring for his pigeons, a rare tender moment in the opening episode and the only activity that seems to bring Tyson some peace, he describes the birds with no little pathos as “the only thing I loved [which] loved me back”. When one of them has its head fatally twisted by an older boy, Tyson throws his first punch, and never looks back.</p> <p>Two vital mentors enable the young fighter to progress into infamy. The first, Cus D'Amato (a cussed Harvey Keitel), lays the foundations, encouraging his charge to “embrace [his] villainy . . . throw punches with bad intentions, with the speed of the devil”. The second is the notorious Don King, boxing promoter, showman and supremely gifted in the art of hyperbole. King plays arguably the most important role in the making of Mike Tyson.</p> <p>“He was a carnival barker,” says Russell Hornsby, who plays the extrovert promoter in the series. “His promotional skills, his style, his savoir-faire, helped bring people to the arena.” Was he good for Tyson? “They were good for each other,” he tells me in a phone call from Los Angeles. “If Don King is not present in his life at that time, we don't see the hyping of Mike Tyson.”</p> <p>Having guided Muhammad Ali through the latter stages of his career, King was also practised in using America's precarious racial politics as part of his promotional spiel. “Don't be <em>their </em>monster,” he tells Tyson in the show, at a moment when the boxer is being exploited by the white establishment. “Be <em>our</em> king.”</p> <p>“King instilled the sense of ‘us against the world' into Mike, and then he convinced him that it was ‘us <em>as black men</em> against the world',” says Hornsby. “And for a while, Mike took on that responsibility. But I do believe that the pressure of that mounted, and it got too much for him.</p> <p>“King used race as a selling point. He knew what America's fascination was with the black body, historically, and he used it to his advantage. He used race, and the racism of America, to make a lot of money, and make a lot of money for his boxers.” In the series, Tyson describes his involvement with King as “one of the biggest mistakes” of his life. “Yes, there were times when King took advantage of him,” says Hornsby. “But he took advantage of a lot of his fighters. One fighter that he never took advantage of was Larry Holmes, and that is because Larry knew what he was dealing with.”</p> <p>On Tyson's troubled and loveless childhood, Hornsby says the boxer spent much of his life looking to “fill that void”, with largely fruitless results. His relationship with D'Amato, which ended on the manager's death in 1985, was one of mutual affection and admiration. “But then you put the same kind of trust in the next person, and when they slowly begin to betray you, you don't realise how that is affecting you. And then you go back to the birds and think, ‘That is the purest form of love I ever had.'”</p> <p>Tyson will inevitably be more remembered for his crimes and misdemeanours, the most serious of which was his rape of 18-year-old Desiree Washington in 1991, than for his boxing prowess. I ask Hornsby how he thinks history will judge Tyson, who has already denounced the series, describing it on social media as a “slave master takeover story about my life”.</p> <p>“We have to look at it in the context of time healing all wounds, and time changing one's perception,” he replies. “Where was America, and where was its culture in the 1980s? If you look at how Mike was portrayed in the 1980s, 1990s, even the early 2000s, we all saw it through this negative racial lens.</p> <p>“Now that we have gained more perspective, as a country, as a culture, we have evolved. We don't look at it through that same lens. Now, we look at where America was racially in the '80s and '90s, where America was as it pertained to misogyny and to the physical abuse of women. And we have to ask ourselves, where did that come from? We can look at the issue of mental illness at that time, and how we viewed it then, as opposed to now.</p> <p>“I don't believe we are excusing anyone for their behaviour. But I think now, 30-odd years later, we can say in earnest, ‘We understand.' And we can have a greater conversation about the ills of race, the ills of misogyny, our lack of understanding of mental issues. We can have that better conversation, when shows like these are presented.”</p> <p><em>On Hulu in the US from August 25 and on Disney Plus in the UK from September 8</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Peter Aspden 2022 'Telling Tyson's story in new TV series Mike: ‘We all saw it through this negative racial lens'' FT.com 27 August.
