  "title": "'Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me' Review: A Pop Star's Survival Song; A candid documentary on AppleTV+ explores the singer's struggles with her physical health, mental illness and celebrity",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>So she unburdens herself to director Alek Keshishian (\"Madonna: Truth or Dare\") in a film that seems equal parts therapy session, self-promotion, rebranding and, as befits the fractured subject at its center, a mixed bag of nonfiction techniques—cinéma-vérité travel sequences, first-person diary entries and fly-on-the-wall conversations with friends and advisers (Ms. Gomez's manager, Aleen Keshishian, is the director's sister). Early on we get an avalanche of highly stylized, black-and-white concert footage, which is exhilarating stuff. But it also makes one realize that with an ample trove of chaotic images and sound—plus some expert editing—you could fashion a horror-thriller sequence about anybody and anything.</p><p>The effect is powerful, though, given the circumstances, the most dire being the cancellation of the singer's \"Revival\" tour of 2016, due to her emotional and physical ailments. (\"It just all sucks,\" Ms. Gomez groans during one distressed moment, \"[and] it sucks the life out of me.\") Mr. Keshishian evidently left the film project after the tour cancellation, which was followed by a resurgence of Ms. Gomez's lupus symptoms, a consequent kidney transplant, and a visit to a psychiatric hospital. Ms. Gomez reportedly asked the director back a couple of years later to film her trip to a school she funded in Kenya, and the documentary then took on a broader shape, which included the singer-songwriter's confessional approach to her mental and physical states. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder she receives is greeted with relief. At least now, she says, I know why I feel this way.</p><p>As captured by Mr. Keshishian, Ms. Gomez comes across as an extremely likable person, thoughtful, gifted, inexplicably guilty over her success and conflicted about a childhood spent acting; she's been working since age 7 (on \"Barney &amp; Friends\") but made her name on \"Wizards of Waverly Place,\" a Disney Channel show from whose shadow she'd evidently like to escape, though it helped cultivate the Gen Z segment of her fan base—something she's expanded with her role in the comedy series \"Only Murders in the Building,\" a Hulu program she also executive produces.</p><p>When not being assisted with her makeup, hair and dosages (\"Do you want to do your morning meds?\" her constant companion, Raquelle Stevens, asks more than once) Ms. Gomez comes across as an ordinary 27-year-old woman (she is now 30), albeit one who causes the child of an old classmate to run screaming from her in excitement during a trip to her hometown of Grand Prairie, Texas.</p><p>The aforementioned trip to Kenya also provides a glimpse of an unguarded Gomez, the African girls provoking the star's conflicted feelings about her own considerable privilege, her expressed need to \"give back,\" and her regrets over what she was deprived of in life. There is some brief testimony from Ms. Gomez's friends, associates and ex-associates (several of whom make psychiatric diagnoses; a mental-health professional or two might have shed light on what's going on with Ms. Gomez, but it's not that kind of movie). Mr. Keshishian also includes a short interview with Ms. Gomez's estranged mother, Mandy, crying over her daughter's condition. It is a notably tearless display, which might explain something. As it is, the worthwhile \"Selena Gomez: My Mind &amp; Me\" explains much, about the star, the culture and maybe the moment.</p><p>Mr. Anderson is the Journal's TV critic.</p><p>'Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me' Review: A Pop Star's Survival Song</p>",
