  "title": "NFL Fines Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers for Covid-19 Violations; The modest fines came as the Green Bay Packers star said he takes \"full responsibility\" for misleading comments falsely stating he had been vaccinated.",
  "text": "<p>\"I made some comments that people might have felt were misleading,\" Rodgers said Tuesday. \"To anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility for those comments.\"</p><p>\"This has definitely been a time of a lot of reflection,\" he said from his Covid isolation. \"I understand that people are suffering.\"</p><p>Rodgers missed Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs, which the Packers lost, after testing positive for Covid-19 last week. He was then placed into the NFL's protocols for unvaccinated players, which came as a surprise after he had previously indicated he received the vaccine. In August, when asked if he was vaccinated, he replied: \"Yeah, I'm immunized.\"</p><p>The revelation sparked an outcry that he had misled the public, which he vehemently denied during his first public comments on the subject last Friday. In an extended interview on former NFL punter Pat McAfee's show, Rodgers insisted he didn't lie. He also criticized the \"woke mob\" for attacking him, assailed the NFL's protocols as draconian and labeled himself as a \"critical thinker\" while invoking civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>Rodgers indicated Tuesday he wanted to move on from the fracas. While noting he did not make his vaccine decision \"frivolously,\" he said his focus was on returning to the field for the 7-2 Packers, who just lost in his absence while he had to watch at home.</p><p>\"I'm an athlete, not an activist,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm going to go back to do what I do best, and that's playing ball.\"</p><p>The NFL's review, which also resulted in a $14,650 fine for wide receiver Allen Lazard, found a trio of protocol violations. Rodgers failed to wear a mask as mandated during press conferences while in the team facility, where unvaccinated players are required to wear face coverings. The investigation also found a few isolated incidents of Rodgers and Lazard failing to wear a mask in other instances when they were supposed to.</p><p>The third factor was a Halloween party, videos of which surfaced on social media. Unvaccinated players face restrictions on their activities, such as going to indoor bars and other places where Covid-19 is easily transmissible. Although the club did not sanction the party, the league said the team was aware of it—and the rule breaking—after it took place and didn't discipline the two players or report the violations to the league.</p><p>Rodgers said in the lengthy interview last week that he chose not to be vaccinated after extensive research about what was best for his body. He claimed he was allergic to the two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, though he did not specify his allergy, and he said he did not trust the one-shot vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson. All three vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness while also reducing transmission and spread.</p><p>He also said last week that his Covid treatment included monoclonal antibodies and ivermectin, the antiparasitic drug that federal health regulators have warned against using, based on advice he received from the podcaster Joe Rogan.</p><p>In his appearance on the same sports talk show on Tuesday, Rodgers maintained he took the proper stance by choosing not to receive the vaccine—even as he took \"full responsibility\" to people who felt misled.</p><p>\"I stand by what I said and the reasons why I made the decision,\" Rodgers said Tuesday while wearing a \"Star Wars\" sweatshirt and a beanie.</p><p>According to the NFL's health and safety protocols, vaccinated players can return to the field more quickly with negative tests on consecutive days. When Rodgers was immediately ruled out for last Sunday's game, that meant he was placed into the protocols for unvaccinated players, which dictate a player has to miss a minimum of 10 days. The earliest he can return is Saturday, and he said Tuesday there is a small possibility he is unable to play in this weekend's game against the Seattle Seahawks.</p><p>Rodgers's comments last Friday also took direct aim at the NFL. He said he believed he was immunized because of his conversations with \"healers\" rooted in holistic and homeopathic medicine, saying they worked to stimulate his immune system. He said he had filed an appeal to the league that he should be treated as though he were vaccinated, but that appeal was denied. He also skewered the NFL's Covid-19 protocols, designed to mitigate the spread of the virus, as draconian.</p><p>Last week, a league official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, refuted a number of Rodgers's assertions, including his claim that he spoke with an NFL doctor who he claims told him that people who have been vaccinated can't catch or spread Covid-19. The official said no doctor from the league, nor any independent consultants used by the league and its players' association, communicated with Rodgers, although that option was made available to him.</p><p>The official had said the Packers medical staff in August made an inquiry to the players' union over whether a homeopathic treatment could render Rodgers vaccinated under the protocols. The union relayed materials Rodgers had sent along about his treatment to the NFL. A review found no peer-reviewed research and a lack of scientific data supporting his supposed treatment.</p><p>Rodgers and the NFL may be subject to discipline for Covid-19 protocol violations, including instances when he gave press conferences inside the team facility without a mask—a requirement for unvaccinated players.</p><p>Rodgers, who was subject to daily tests under the NFL's protocols for unvaccinated players, said after symptoms first appeared last week he has been feeling better and now feels that he's on the \"other side of it.\"</p><p>Rodgers's comments placed him at the center of controversy inside a country where vaccines, and workplace mandates, have become a hot-button issue. Prevea Health, a Wisconsin healthcare provider, said over the weekend it was ending its relationship with him. Last Friday, he blamed the media for its efforts to \"out and shame\" unvaccinated athletes and accurately predicted the reaction to his remarks.</p><p>​​\"The right is gonna champion me, and the left is gonna cancel me. And the whole time, I don't give a s— about either of them,\" he said. \"Politics is a total sham.\"</p><p>Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com</p><p>NFL Fines Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers for Covid-19 Violations</p>",
