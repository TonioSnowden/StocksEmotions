  "title": "Shanghai Orders Over Half Its Residents to Undergo Covid Testing as Resurgence Fears Rise; Authorities in the Chinese city of 25 million people are calling for vigilance just eight days after celebrating the lifting of a monthslong lockdown",
  "text": "<p>All residents will be placed under fengbi guanli, or \"closed-off management,\" until all samples have been collected, Zhao Dandan, a deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said at a Thursday news conference. Authorities didn't spell out the details of what closed-off management entails, but they have used similar terms in the past to refer to measures that include preventing residents from leaving their apartment units or their residential complexes.</p><p>\"The risk of resurgence of the pandemic still exists,\" Mr. Zhao told reporters. \"We must not be slack to the slightest degree or let down our guard.\"</p><p>Affected districts include Pudong, the city's most populous district and one that endured some of the longest lockdowns, stretching back to March. Normally bustling downtown business districts such as Huangpu and Xuhui are also covered by the order.</p><p>The newly tightened measures come as infections have been detected in parts of the city in the days following the lifting of strict citywide lockdowns on June 1.</p><p>Many residents have expressed a sense of foreboding around the fresh rounds of mass testing, fearing that they could serve as prelude to a resumption of strict lockdowns, a scenario that many regard as inevitableâ€”given the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and the Chinese leadership's strict adherence to its policy of seeking to stamp out infections.</p><p>In Shanghai's Minhang district, a man surnamed Zhou said he never stopped stocking up on basic food supplies such as rice and frozen meat, even as the city eased restrictions on June 1. While he sees the chances of another strict citywide lockdown as low given the leadership's attempts to restart the economy, he has prepared himself mentally for word that he won't be allowed to step outside of his apartment.</p><p>\"Judging from the big crowd on the subway, it's only a matter of time before we have another outbreak,\" said Mr. Zhou. \"In a way, it feels like we are back to March all over again.\"</p><p>In Shanghai's southwestern district of Songjiang, home to some of Shanghai's largest university campuses, all residents will be subjected to Covid testing on Saturday and Sunday, the district government announced on its official social-media account. All citizens must complete at least one Covid test each week under the latest rules, it added, without giving an end date.</p><p>Songjiang wasn't among the seven districts named in the municipal government announcement, and it would represent an eighth district in which all residents have to undergo testing.</p><p>While government officials didn't specify what measures they would take if infections were detected, some neighborhoods in Shanghai this week have imposed lockdowns of between two days and two weeks on their residents after finding positive cases, according to notices from more than a dozen residential compounds reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Under China's strict Covid containment measures, all those who have tested positive or have been identified as being in close contact with infected individuals must isolate in a hotel or a quarantine facility, typically for two weeks.</p><p>The tightening of Covid measures comes after infections had plunged to near zero around the June 1 date that authorities had set for undoing Covid restrictions, from a daily average of about 20,000 cases in April.</p><p>Shanghai reported just nine new infections on Thursday, including three people who worked at the same hair salon, where some workers didn't undergo daily Covid tests, local authorities said.</p><p>Just days earlier, Shanghai residents were again roaming the streets and filling restaurants after more than two months cooped up at home. Shanghai Disney Resort said on Thursday it would partially reopen some of its resort locations on Friday following its closure in March, though the main amusement park will remain closed until further notice.</p><p>Millions of businesses had begun bringing their operations back online and sending workers back to offices. As of a week ago, car marker Tesla Inc. had brought its manufacturing capacity back to 70%, according to people familiar with the matter, while the city's main Pudong International Airport was handling about 80% of its pre-Covid lockdown cargo levels, according to official data.</p><p>Zhao Yueling contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stella Yifan Xie at stella.xie@wsj.com</p><p>Shanghai Orders Over Half Its Residents to Undergo Covid Testing as Resurgence Fears Rise</p>",
