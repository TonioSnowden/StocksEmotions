  "text": "<p>Subscribers who choose the ad-supported tier will see four to five minutes of ads per hour, with each running about 15 seconds or 30 seconds, before and during content. Netflix said it has nearly sold out its ad inventory for the launch.</p><p>\"The discounted pricing of Netflix's ad tier will make it attractive to consumers.

But its potential impact in future years is immense.\"</p><p>The deceleration of Netflix subscribers has allowed The Walt Disney Co.'s DIS younger rival streaming serviceto catapult into the top spot for now. Disney also plans to introduce ads to its Disney+ streaming service while raising prices for its offerings without ads, with commercials expected to begin on specific plans in December.</p><p>Netflix has acted quickly to jack up revenue with initiatives covering a first-time advertising platform, a crackdown on shared passwords, and a foray into videogames â€” much to the relief of financial analysts.</p><p>For more: Netflix is pulling out all the stops to reverse a slide in subscribers</p><p>\"We think investors are looking ahead to the ad tier rollout (possibly by Nov '22) &amp; password sharing solution,\" Cowen analyst John Blackledge said in a note Oct. 5 that maintained an outperform rating on Netflix shares and a price target of $325. \"Our U.S. survey suggests NFLX remains the most popular living room TV option, while TikTok gains mobile share.\"</p><p>Ads are coming to Netflix in November with plan costing $6.99 a month</p>",
