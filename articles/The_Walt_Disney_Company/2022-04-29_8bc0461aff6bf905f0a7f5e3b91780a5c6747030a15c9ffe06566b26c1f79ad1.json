  "text": "<p>   I was bullied terribly in school. After we moved out of London when I was 11, I was very skinny, and the bullying only got worse. It got to a point where I wasn't allowed to go to recess. </p><p>   My family first lived in the Willesden area of North West London in a railway cottage. When we first moved in, there was an outdoor toilet. </p><p>   My parents started out as performers. When I arrived, my dad was an actor who hadn't made it and was a drama teacher. My mother taught drama as well. </p><p>   My mother, Anne, was at times emotionally distant, but she isn't now. We have a much closer relationship. </p><p>   My father, Thane, and I were incredibly close -- until I got to an age where I stopped being able to reflect the version of himself that he wanted to see. </p><p>   I was the middle child. My sister, Sarah, was older and my brother, Matthew, was born when I was 8. Not long after he arrived, we moved to Potters Bar, about 20 minutes north of London. </p><p>   Our cookie-cutter house was on the campus of a girls' boarding school where my father taught. I believe I had undiagnosed dyslexia and probably ADHD. I found it hard to thrive in secondary school or to make friends. </p><p>   At 16, I left and began attending a local tertiary college. One morning, I was told that my 8-year-old brother, Matthew, had been seriously injured, having fallen off the roof of a one-story pavilion. At the hospital, he was still conscious but died soon after. </p><p>   We were close. Matthew was everything I wasn't. He was outgoing, sweet and beloved at his school and not bullied. </p><p>   After his death, I was crushed. I dropped out of college and moved to London to play guitar on the street. I regularly wondered what I was going to do with my life. My parents had been actors, so I auditioned and was admitted to Drama Centre London. </p><p>   I quickly discovered that I could pour all of my rage, guilt, shame and loss into my roles. </p><p>   Three years later, when I graduated, I was cast in the West End revival of \"An Inspector Calls\" and performed in the Royal Shakespeare Company. </p><p>   I eventually took a job in a theater above a pub. While performing in Joe Penhall's \"Love and Understanding,\" a young producer, James Richardson, saw me. I was cast for \"Gangster No. 1,\" a 2000 U.K. film that gave me visibility. </p><p>   Today, my wife, actress Jennifer Connelly, and I live in New York's Brooklyn Heights with our young daughter. Our two adult boys are out of the house. </p><p>   At times, shyness still plagues me. Though it isn't easy to cure, I have a phrase I use to relax at social events: \"Can I please have a glass of Sancerre?\" </p><p>   -- As told to Marc Myers </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Paul Bettany, 50, is an English actor best known for playing Vision in TV's \"WandaVision\" and as the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. in Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. He co-stars in Prime Video's miniseries, \"A Very British Scandal.\" </p><p></p>",
