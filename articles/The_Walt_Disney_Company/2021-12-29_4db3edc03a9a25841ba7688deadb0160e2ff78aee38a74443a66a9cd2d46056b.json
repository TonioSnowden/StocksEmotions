  "text": "<p>Those successes secured South Korea's reputation for making high-quality shows with low production costs, a formula that is tempting rivals in the streaming business to jump in. Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+ and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ have recently launched in South Korea, with ambitious plans to develop Korean-language content. AT&amp;T Inc.'s HBO Max is also staffing up in the country, according to job postings on LinkedIn, suggesting it might be readying a debut. AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia, which oversees HBO Max, declined to comment.</p><p>Feeding more streaming platforms, however, threatens to drive up acquisition costs as companies seek to outbid one another for top shows. It also puts pressure on South Korea's entertainment industry to crank out global hits.</p><p>\"There's a lot of stuff to produce over the next couple of years,\" said Vivek Couto, executive director at Singapore-based Media Partners Asia, which advises media and telecom companies. \"Will quality be sustained?\"</p><p>Streaming platforms have been relying more on the Asia-Pacific region for growth, and viewers in the U.S., U.K., Australia and Europe are warming to non-English-language content.</p><p>There are now about 1.7 billion users of subscription-video services world-wide, up from 457 million in 2016, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. In 2016, Asia had about 30% of total users, compared with 60% today.</p><p>U.S.-based streaming platforms have tapped other regions, from Latin America to the Middle East to Europe, making global stars from locally produced telenovelas, heist shows and crime thrillers.</p><p>South Korean shows -- which span genres including rom-com, zombie and historical drama -- draw a diverse audience and have proved effective at persuading people to sign up for a streaming service, retain them and get them to watch more, industry executives say.</p><p>\"We believe that markets like Korea will soon become global content powerhouses for the media and entertainment industry,\" said Luke Kang, Walt Disney's Asia-Pacific president.</p><p>Local production costs can be as low as one-tenth those of Hollywood, said Jung Kyung-moon, CEO of JTBC Studios, a South Korean studio behind \"D.P.,\" a military drama, which hit Netflix's global top 10 list this year. JTBC Studios has a growing presence in the U.S. \"From the perspective of streaming platforms, it's a great bang for the buck,\" Mr. Jung said.</p><p>In 2017, about 15% of the world's 100 most popular streaming titles were made outside the U.S., according to Ampere Analysis, which has a proprietary metric for global viewership. Now the proportion has grown to 27%, it said.</p>",
