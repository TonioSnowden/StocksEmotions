  "title": "'Lightyear' Review: A Rousing Romp Through Space and Time; The new 'Toy Story' spinoff is nostalgic and fun without taking itself too seriously.",
  "text": "<p>So it's a relief that the \"Toy Story\" spinoff \"Lightyear\" is mostly just a diverting comic space adventure, albeit one with a few somber elements. Pixar isn't trying to mint a new classic here, nor to win another Oscar, so viewers stand a solid chance of getting through the movie without crying. It's nice to know that Team Pixar can still recognize the importance of fun. Though \"Lightyear\" isn't as funny as the original \"Toy Story,\" nor as emotionally potent as \"Toy Story 2,\" and hence probably won't be rewatched nearly as many times as those two classics, it's a plucky and rousing little sci-fi saga.</p><p>Making a wry comment on Disney's hyperactive merchandising empire, the opening titles inform us that Buzz Lightyear the toy was created to capitalize on the movie we're about to watch. It's refreshing when major corporations feel free to joke about their own pursuit of an honest buck. To cupidity, and beyond!</p><p>The previous iteration of Buzz was designed as a broad comic foil, not a lead character, so the film's writer-director Angus MacLane and his co-writer Jason Headley have deftly toned down the buffoonish aspects of our favorite space ranger, who this time is voiced by Chris Evans to distinguish him from the action figure voiced by Tim Allen. Buzz the movie hero retains the toy's strutting bravado, but he's much more thoughtful and sensitive to the concerns of others, especially his gently indulgent boss Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba), who is the most conspicuously gay character in the history of Pixar features. (The same-sex relationship in \"Lightyear\" has gotten it banned from several Muslim countries.)</p><p>Buzz is an officer on a \"Star Trek\"-style team of space explorers who makes an error that leaves him, Alisha and hundreds of their colleagues marooned on a faraway planet. Obsessively focused on redeeming himself, he seeks to engineer an escape that involves testing a spacecraft using a custom-made super-fuel. By surpassing the speed of light during test flights, though, Buzz becomes in effect a time traveler: Everyone he left behind is notably older when he returns. Decades pass on what becomes the space settlers' new home planet as Buzz, afflicted with savior syndrome, continues his experiments. Here's where the Pixar poignancy kicks in. Buzz's quixotic urge to be everyone's hero has made him a loner two times over. Now he's marooned in time as well as in space, and having driven himself away from others he needs to learn that even a fearless space ranger must think in terms of his part on a team.</p><p>Typically obtuse, Buzz misses a fairly important development on his fellow explorers' adoptive planet, which is that it has been overtaken by an army of alien robots led by the hulking Zurg (James Brolin). The presence of Zurg is a callback treat for obsessive fans of the \"Toy Story\" franchise. We first met the action-figure version of this interstellar reprobate in \"Toy Story 2,\" in which he was a kind of visual spoof of the Transformers toys and the gonzo look of Japanese anime. This time fully fleshed out with a back story and an intriguing hidden motive, Zurg turns out to present a thorny time-travel quandary for Buzz and his hastily formed team of undertrained combatants: Alisha's timid granddaughter Izzy (Keke Palmer), a clueless neophyte (Taika Waititi) and a rugged middle-aged female ex-convict (Dale Soules). That Izzy is a would-be space ranger who is terrified of space adds a funny wrinkle to a character who, in the hands of less confident screenwriters, might be yet another boringly accomplished and fearless female.</p><p>As is often the case in Disney movies, the comically hectic main action can feel a bit rote. The real creative triumph is in the throwaway bitsâ€”the screenwriting marginalia. The biggest laughs are generated by yet another in Disney's unsurpassed line of nonhuman sidekicks, an emotional-support robo-cat named Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn). Sox combines all the best properties of a furry pet, an artificial-intelligence program and a Swiss Army knife. You'd be hard-pressed to name a more drolly useful little machine since R2-D2.</p><p>Mr. Smith is the critic-at-large for National Review.</p><p>'Lightyear' Review: A Rousing Romp Through Space and Time</p>",
