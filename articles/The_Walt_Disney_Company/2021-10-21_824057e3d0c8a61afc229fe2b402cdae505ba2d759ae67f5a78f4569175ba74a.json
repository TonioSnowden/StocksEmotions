  "title": "Wes Anderson pays homage to journalism in The French Dispatch",
  "text": "<p>There are many ways a film can curry favour with journalists. In lieu of actual bribery — underrated — Wes Anderson's <em>The French Dispatch</em> goes for flattery. Most of my profession should not get excited. The journalism the director likes is particular. The magazine of the title is a proxy for The New Yorker (with a dash of The Paris Review). Even then, both have been deeply Andersonised — a mob of characterful expats reporting back to America from France, impossibly stern about dangling participles.</p> <p>The film is really an anthology of shorts, billed as three feature articles. It would be as true to say three pastiches of French cinema or ornate pâtisserie gateaux. Blame the film for the metaphor, set as it is in the conceit of Ennui-sur-Blasé, introduced amid a whirl of knowing Gallic clichés. (Cue Citröen 2CV.) If Anderson were afraid of the archetypal, he would be a different film-maker. Much of the rest is his own stock combination of just-so geometrics and a high-end ensemble, some of whom will be underused (did Elisabeth Moss say something rash on-set?) and one of whom will be Bill Murray, cast here as all-seeing editor Arthur Howitzer Jr.<br><br>Another regular, Tilda Swinton, introduces the first vignette, the slippery tale of a feted artist and his model — also his prison guard. The inmate is Benicio del Toro, the muse Léa Seydoux. Executed in black and white, the touchstone is genius tyrant Henri-Georges Clouzot. In the second tale, Anderson goes full Nouvelle Vague as Frances McDormand takes notes in 1968 and the inescapable Timothée Chalamet leads the “chessboard revolution”. In the last, the 1955 noir <em>Rififi</em> hangs in the air while Jeffrey Wright plays a food critic part-based on polymath James Baldwin, plunged into a gastronomic crime caper.<br><br>Among the stampede of actors are flashbulb moments of visual wit: del Toro's fellow prisoners burst en masse through a stone wall; a pinball machine bears the logo “Modern Physics”. And between the perfect references come real insights too — about artists and markets, the cult of youth and commodification of revolt. In the final story, self-awareness seems to inform a chef discovering a wholly new flavour. “That's rare at my age,” he murmurs.<br><br>Yet somehow all this is easier to appreciate after the fact, free of the eternal pressure to greet every bit of whimsy with a small, dazzled round of applause. Given that Anderson is fond of declarative bullet points, it is also tempting to note that: 1) It is strange to find the politically vital James Baldwin set down in a romp about poisoned radishes. 2) Stranger still that the film would affect such melancholy about the end of maverick independents such as Howitzer when the director spent the past two decades making films for Rupert Murdoch's Fox (and now does so for Disney instead).</p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>In cinemas from October 22</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Wes Anderson pays homage to journalism in The French Dispatch' FT.com 21 October.
