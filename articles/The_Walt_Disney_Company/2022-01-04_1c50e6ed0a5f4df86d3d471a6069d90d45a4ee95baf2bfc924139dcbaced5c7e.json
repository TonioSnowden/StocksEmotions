  "title": "Fanatics Pried Baseball Cards from Topps. Now Fanatics is Buying Topps. The new company, valued last year at over $10 billion, accelerated its launch with the purchase of the company synonymous with baseball cards for decades",
  "text": "<p>The acquisition accelerates Fanatics' stranglehold on the business and restores a sense of continuity to an industry undergoing a seismic transformation. Fanatics Trading Cards is now poised to manufacture and distribute baseball trading cards immediately—years ahead of schedule, the people said.</p><p>The sale comes less than five months after the deals struck by Fanatics scuttled Topps' plan to go public in a blank-check merger. That deal, which valued Topps at about over $1 billion, fell apart in August when Major League Baseball and its players' union struck exclusive deals with the new Fanatics-led company.</p><p>At the same time, Fanatics Trading Cards reached agreements with the unions representing players in the National Football League and the National Basketball Association, along with the NBA.</p><p>The Fanatics deals represented dramatic upheaval in a decades-old industry that was experiencing a boom in popularity, in part spurred by the pandemic. It also raised questions about Fanatics' plans for a product that is nostalgic for many consumers.</p><p>The new Fanatics business was supposed to have years to find an answer. Fanatics Trading Cards' deal with MLB wasn't set to begin until after the 2025 season. But by acquiring Topps's sports and entertainment division, along with its roughly 350 employees, Fanatics is positioned to begin its work in baseball now with a brand already familiar to hobbyists, the people said. (The basketball and football players' unions currently have agreements with Panini America, which still run for several more years.)</p><p>Topps also produces trading cards for Major League Soccer; Formula One; UEFA, European soccer's governing body; and the Bundesliga, the top professional soccer league in Germany. Those rights now transfer to Fanatics.</p><p>That adds to the portfolio of a business that has attained an enormous evaluation in a short period. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that a trio of investors—private-equity firm Silver Lake, entertainment giant Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., and Insight Partners, a private-equity and venture-capital firm—invested $350 million in Series A funding that valued the firm at about $10.4 billion.</p><p>In 2007, Topps was bought for $385 million by Tornante Co. LLC–led by former Walt Disney Co. chief executive Michael Eisner–and private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners. Those entities will continue to own what remains of Topps: confectionary and gift card divisions.</p><p>Topps was on the verge of going public in August via a deal with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, when The Wall Street Journal reported Fanatics had seized its prized asset: the baseball card licenses. That sunk the SPAC deal as it was nearing its completion. A Topps spokesman at the time indicated the company was blindsided by baseball's bolt to Fanatics.</p><p>The various leagues and players unions opted to partner with Fanatics because of their belief that the company could transform an industry they believed was ripe for transformation. Fanatics, which has licensing deals with the major sports leagues and universities, had already become a behemoth by doing just that in the apparel business. The leagues and the unions also got equity stakes in Fanatics Trade Cards as part of the deal.</p><p>Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com and Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com</p><p>Fanatics Pried Baseball Cards from Topps.
