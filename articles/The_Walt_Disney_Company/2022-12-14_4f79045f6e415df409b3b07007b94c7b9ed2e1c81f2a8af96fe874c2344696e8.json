  "title": "Why Is There Beef Jerky in My Advent Calendar? Calendars also offer wine, coffee pods, rocks for each day leading to Dec. 25",
  "text": "<p>Traditionally, Advent calendars were simple, often homemade affairs of felt, wood or decorated cardboard, sometimes filled with tiny chocolates. But in recent years, sellers from luxury jewelers to artisan beef jerky makers have released their own offerings, with particularly coveted calendars hitting the market in late summer.</p><p>Released in August, Bonne Maman's calendar, which bears 23 fruit spreads and one jar of honey, has sold out every year since it was introduced in 2017 and often resurfaces on secondary sellers at multiples of its original $39.99 price. This year its release generated so much frenzy it temporarily crashed the company's website.</p><p>Some, such as candle-maker Voluspa's $75 entry, cover only 12 days, though Advent typically refers to the roughly four weeks leading up to Christmas. Many, such as Costco's popular calendar, which includes 24 half-bottles of wine, are geared strictly toward adults. A few—say, porcelain-maker Wedgewood's collectible ornaments calendar, retailing for $885—bear price tags that could strike fear into the heart of Ebenezer Scrooge.</p><p>\"I'm not even certain if I knew what an Advent calendar was before the kitschy food ones started coming out,\" said Ms. Lord, who posts an Instagram story each morning in which she offers a critique of the day's flavor. \"Then I immediately got on board. It's so wholesome.\"</p><p>Calendars filled with top-shelf cosmetics—such as U.K. department store Liberty London's $320 offering—are a great way to get a sackful of skin-care items for a fraction of the typical price, fans say. But those filled with holiday treats or trinkets tap into a special vein of nostalgia, said Caroline Moss, host of shopping podcast \"Gee Thanks, Just Bought It!\"</p><p>Though novelty Advent calendars were firmly part of the retail landscape before 2020, Ms. Moss said she saw their popularity explode during the pandemic when, separated from loved ones and with little to do, many people took comfort in expanded holiday traditions.</p><p>What makes an Advent calendar distinct from a pile of samples, she said, is presentation. \"I really appreciate the commitment to, 'It's an Advent calendar!' No, that's just 24 pods of coffee,\" said Ms. Moss. \"But people love stuff like that and you really can find one for anything.\"</p><p>Bonne Maman's calendar is about \"nurturing little moments of love and caring,\" said Sylvain Dronet, CEO of Andros North America, a subsidiary of Andros France, which owns the brand. But there are still the supply chain and international regulations to consider for the 23 countries in which the calendar is available. At the company's test kitchen in France, chefs are already developing limited-edition flavors for the 2023 calendar.</p><p>Mr. Dronet said customers frequently contact the company searching for certain limited-edition flavors. (Ms. Lord said she has been \"haunted\" for years by the memory of a cherry almond flavor that was exclusive to the calendar.)</p><p>When Heather Warren's first nephew was born, she began wrapping tiny items throughout the year—Matchbox cars, dollar items from Target—to make an Advent calendar especially for him. When his two brothers were born, 75 items began to seem like a tall order for even the most dedicated aunt, and she started ordering themed calendars each August.</p><p>This year she bought Mario, Pokémon, and Lego \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" calendars for the boys, now 15, 9 and 7. Previous favorites include a National Geographic rocks and minerals calendar and one including figurines of characters from \"The Office.\"</p><p>\"I will provide Advent calendars as long as they want me to; I love doing it,\" said Ms. Warren, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas. This year, for the first time, she bought herself one—the jam calendar.</p><p>As Lindsay William-Ross's 9-year-old son tore into his calendar on Dec. 1, she joked that she wished she had her own. He offered to share his Lego \"Star Wars\" edition, which includes Darth Vader in a Hawaiian shirt, but she had an idea for a calendar centered on one of her favorite things: \"Law &amp; Order: SVU.\"</p><p>\"I thought, 'What do I love more than anything?'\" she said, rejecting booze, chocolate and makeup. \"And that's Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson.\"</p><p>She downloaded the Law &amp; Order font and printed a list of 24 of her favorite episodes, cutting them into individual scraps of paper and slipping each under a number on a cork board. Now, as her son unveils a new Lego each evening, she reveals an episode to watch after dinner.</p><p>\"It adds an extra element of fun,\" said Ms. William-Ross, who lives in Vancouver, Canada. \"My dream SVU Advent calendar would have, underneath one of the days, a hug from Mariska Hargitay.\"</p><p>As a child, Samuel Liltorp Johnson dreamed of a Lego Advent calendar only to be stymied each year by one filled with chocolate. As an adult and designer at the Lego Group, he had the opportunity to create one of the toymaker's Advent calendars himself—a brigade of firefighters released in anticipation of Christmas 2012. This year, he has been counting down the days with a vintage Lego calendar from 1993 given to him by a fellow toy collector in Denmark, where he now lives with his family.</p><p>\"What I'm loving is that this is my era of Lego as a kid that I'm seeing through adult eyes. When I finish with it, maybe I'll send it to another collector to enjoy next year,\" he said, adding, \"I'll need to glue one of the doors back on.\"</p><p>Write to Kathryn Dill at Kathryn.Dill@wsj.com</p><p>Why Is There Beef Jerky in My Advent Calendar?</p>",
