  "text": "<p>Never mind the truth, here's the Sex Pistols. A new six-part drama charting the band's tempestuous three years at the vanguard of the punk movement in 1970s London launches much to the chagrin of the group's former frontman John Lydon (better known as Johnny Rotten), who claims that the series has “stolen the past and created a fairytale”.</p> <p>To be clear, <em>Pistol</em>, which airs on Disney Plus and Hulu, features a touch more sex, drugs and expletives than you'd usually find in a Disney fairytale. But despite being something of a biased critic, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/134c327c-82b3-48b1-adb8-f6b030b2dce0\">Sex Pistols</a>' Lydon — who unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit against the show to block them from using the band's music last year — makes a fair point. This story about the self-proclaimed “fucked four” feels far too stylised and mythologised for a band whose success was built not so much on music as chaos. While the show is full of squalid settings populated by a host of insalubrious people, director <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Danny_Boyle\">Danny Boyle</a> gives it all a telegenic spin. The unwashed punks are frequently bathed in a soft, ethereal glow that almost confers saintliness. </p> <p>What's missing then is that crucial sense of “raw authenticity” — the very quality which first draws impresario Malcolm McLaren to Steve Jones and his group's atonal noise-mongering. Here McLaren (a cartoonishly effete Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is less an actual person than a handy guide to the sociopolitical significance of the group and their role in the broader cultural revolution. “You're a band of sexy young assassins, whose instruments could just as well be machine guns,” he says at one point, just in case the subtext of the band's name was lost on anyone. </p> <p>Much like the band itself, the scripting and direction can occasionally fail to hit the right notes. But the performances by the cast of relative unknowns are largely pitch-perfect. The first couple of episodes are led by Toby Wallace as the charismatic if slightly doltish Jones. As Jones's memoirs serve as a primary source for the series, it's unsurprising that his character is the most fleshed-out, with flashbacks to his abusive childhood providing moving context for his self-sabotaging behaviour.</p> <p>After getting stage fright at a trial gig, Jones is rebranded by McLaren as a guitarist — which he learns on an amphetamine bender — and replaced at the mic by Lydon. He's played by a wild-eyed Anson Boon who brings an electrifying volatility to every scene. He also imbues the character with an unexpected vulnerability. “They're really mean most of the time,” he confides in friend and future Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious (Louis Partridge, kept on the periphery for the time being) about his mocking bandmates. Lydon may claim that his character's lines are pure fiction, but it's these moments when the show reframes the anarchists as lost children that <em>Pistol </em>feels its most subversive.</p> <p>★★★☆☆<br><strong><br></strong><em>On Disney Plus in the UK and Hulu in the US from May 31</em></p><p>Source: Dan Einav 2022 'Pistol, Disney Plus review — Danny Boyle charts the explosive rise of the Sex Pistols' FT.com 30 May.
