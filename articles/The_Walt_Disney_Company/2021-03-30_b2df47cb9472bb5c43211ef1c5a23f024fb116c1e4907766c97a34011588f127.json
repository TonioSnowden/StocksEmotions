  "title": "Technology:  T-Mobile  To Ditch  Its Online  TV Service  ----  By Drew FitzGerald",
  "text": "<p>    T-Mobile US Inc. is scrapping its efforts to crack into the home television market on its own after the wireless company failed to build its skinny bundle of channels into a profitable service. </p><p>   The cellphone carrier said Monday it will wind down the service, called TVision, on April 29 and steer its wireless customers toward Google's YouTube TV instead. </p><p>   Rival online video packages from Sony Corp. and others have shut operations or raised prices on live-TV service to keep up with programmers that continue to raise fees. </p><p>   T-Mobile launched a remade version of its TV service last year to cater to its base of wireless customers -- the country's second-largest, after Verizon Communications Inc. It also targeted existing cable subscribers and the millions of U.S. households that have dropped TV subscriptions from their bills, opting instead to buy broadband-internet service as a stand-alone item and sign up for a panoply of video services such as Netflix and Disney+. </p><p>   The new product was designed to supplement T-Mobile's home broadband-internet service, which is scheduled to open up to the general public later this year. </p><p>   Virtual pay-TV services delivered entirely online have struggled to break through. AT&amp;T Inc.'s offering -- a service originally launched as DirecTV Now, which delivers channels over the internet without a satellite -- has shrunk since peaking at nearly two million subscribers in 2018. PlayStation Vue, a TV service from Sony, shut down last year. </p><p>    TVision was the cellphone carrier's second attempt at entering the pay-TV industry, after its 2018 purchase of Layer3 TV for $325 million. The company has spent the past two years piecing together the rights to carry enough traditional live-TV channels to compete with its bigger cable-TV rivals. T-Mobile wrote down most of Layer3's value last year, citing a new strategy based partly on recently acquired content rights. </p><p>   Live TV is one of several sweeteners T-Mobile has offered its core base of cellphone customers in recent years. </p><p>   Past promotions have bundled Netflix and the now-defunct Quibi service with customers' wireless bills. </p><p></p>",
