  "text": "<p>Sanne, which handles paperwork for asset managers and hedge funds, has rejected a takeover £1.3bn approach from private equity group Cinven.</p> <p>Cinven confirmed it had made a proposal to take Jersey-based Sanne private in early May at a value of 830p per share, a near 38 per cent premium to its closing price on Thursday. Shareholders would also retain the right to receive the final dividend of 9.9p a share declared in March, it said. </p> <p>Sanne was floated in 2015 at 200p a share by then-majority owner Inflexion, the private equity group, and recently raised £80m through a placing to fund the purchase of Texas-based peer Strait Capital Company. Cinven's interest in the company was first <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/sanne-joins-list-of-london-listed-targets-as-cinven-makes-1-3bn-approach-12305610\">reported by Sky News</a>.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Robert Plant said the bid interest in Sanne followed a trend of increased appetite among private equity buyers for corporate services companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8069c138-8f0a-4c63-b197-772122c0b71c\">such as Equiniti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7b5634f-95c5-4e6b-a6ef-921386e3baf2\">Aggreko</a>. “We think private equity is attracted to the sector because it is defensive, has good revenue visibility given that trusts typically last 10 years, and strong cash flows,” he said,</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Software maker <strong>Sage </strong>said organic recurring revenue growth for 2021 should be towards the top end of its 3 per cent to 5 per cent target range. For the first half ended March Sage reported a headline operating profit of £203m, down 30 per cent year on year due largely to the sale of subsidiaries including Sage Pay in March 2020. On an organic basis operating profit fell 12 per cent to £180m as Sage stepped up investment in cloud services and allowed legacy business lines to wither.</p> <p><strong>Sabre Insurance</strong> reported a year-on-year pick-up in trade for April but cautioned that full-year visibility remained limited due to “numerous intertwined regulatory, market and Covid impacts”. The motor insurance underwriter posted gross written premiums of £46m for the first four months of 2021, down from £54.6m a year ago, and said volumes for the first quarter were in line with its expectations.</p> <p><strong>Crest Nicholson</strong> said it had agreed to sell its 50 per cent stake in Longcross Studio, a film studio and associated land on the northern side of its Longcross Garden Village housing scheme in Surrey, to joint venture partner Aviva for £45m. </p> <p><strong>TheWorks</strong>, the crafts and toys retailer, said recent sales have been “very encouraging” but said uncertainties were still too great to provide profit guidance. Government trading restrictions meant total sales were down 19 per cent to £206m in the year to early May, the company said. Its same-store sales were up 6 per cent year on year in the period with online sales jumping 121 per cent.</p> <p><strong>MaxCyte</strong>, the London-listed cell engineering specialist, said it has applied to US regulators for a dual listing on Nasdaq.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Hedge funds</strong> that bet on corporate deals <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15f6066a-6dce-4322-b615-008f4d8a54ec\">have rebounded from big losses</a> during last spring's coronavirus-driven market turmoil and are aiming to profit from a surge in M&amp;A as economies reopen. Merger arbitrage funds gained 7.7 per cent in the first four months of 2021, according to research firm HFR, having finished last year up 5.2 per cent. The latest firm trying to tap into the renewed appetite for corporate dealmaking is London-based investment firm Trium Capital, which has hired fund manager Felix Lo and analyst Neo Tsangarides.</p> <p><strong>Airbnb's</strong> chief executive on Thursday predicted the “travel rebound of the century” as the home-rental company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7512415-46b2-4378-8356-2d1e2a8a760e\">reported first-quarter revenues</a> that pointed to a strong recovery in the US holiday market. Airbnb's quarterly revenue of $887m was up 5 per cent on the same period last year as guests paid&#xa0;higher rates&#xa0;for bigger and more rural properties.&#xa0;Wall Street had expected $721m in revenue for the quarter.</p> <p>The latest round of quarterly results from media companies, which concluded on Thursday night with figures from <strong>Disney</strong>, has shown that disrupter <strong>Netflix</strong> is now firmly in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48c06611-1c17-4941-96cc-b085dfe05cdf\">the role of defensive incumbent</a>. Three of the old media groups that Netflix sought to dethrone — Disney, <strong>HBO</strong> and <strong>ViacomCBS</strong> — all grew their streaming services more quickly in the first three months of this year than the upstart.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Shaking up a cosy, concentrated market like auditing isn't easy. The fact that the big beasts of the industry are finally taking a tougher line on the jobs they're <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c24120a-26ca-4145-be2c-d9fa95ea9c85\">prepared to do is welcome</a>. But if there are going to be more frequent changes of auditor, best everyone is clear about what's going on.</p> <p><strong>City Insider</strong> <br>Few companies polarise opinion like THG, Matthew Moulding's £6bn&#xa0;protein powder&#xa0;and&#xa0;lucky dip cosmetics box&#xa0;empire, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ff0c2a3-a18b-40ec-96fe-78fd2228f75d\">especially on employee review site&#xa0;Glassdoor</a>.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Financial administrator Sanne rejects Cinven approach' FT.com 14 May.
