  "text": "<p>It's becoming more challenging for UPS to deliver. The carrier said higher shipping rates offset a slowdown in shipments during the second quarter, as more shoppers ventured to stores instead of buying online. While shipments to homes fell 15.8% domestically, business-to-business shipments rose 25.7%. The results come as UPS pursues a \"better, not bigger\" strategy, where the company is being more selective in choosing its customers and what items it ships. UPS also increased contracted shipping prices for large shippers to improve its bottom line. UPS shares lost 7% Tuesday.</p><p>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.</p><p>GE +1.2%</p><p>Demand for jet engines and wind turbines is bringing good things to life for GE. The manufacturing giant raised its 2021 cash-flow goals on higher orders for its industrial machinery. The company continues to recover from a time during the pandemic when airlines grounded planes and canceled jet purchases. \"We're encouraged by the early signs of the recovery,\" Chief Executive Larry Culp said. GE has slashed costs in its aviation unit and streamlined its power business, while shrinking its debt load through asset sales. GE shares added 1.2% Tuesday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN -7.6%</p><p>Big Tech faces new vulnerabilities. On Thursday Amazon reported a slight slowdown in e-commerce sales, highlighting the challenge of sustaining outsize growth as pandemic habits evolve. Apple Inc. is contending with an ongoing chip shortage the company predicted would worsen supply constraints, and Facebook said it expects revenue growth to slow in the second half of the year. Amazon shares fell 7.6% Friday.</p><p>PFIZER INC.</p><p>PFE +3.2%</p><p>Pfizer is getting a boost from its Covid-19 shot. The drugmaker said it expects sales for its Covid-19 vaccine this year to reach about $33.5 billion, a nearly 30% increase from its forecast three months ago. With concerns rising over the highly infectious Delta variant, Pfizer also said that booster shots would likely be needed to ensure protection against the virus. Chief Executive Albert Bourla said the potential need for annual booster shots could make its vaccine sales durable. U.S. officials are studying the issue but haven't authorized the booster shots. Pfizer shares rose 3.2% Wednesday.</p><p>ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC.</p><p>HOOD -8.4%</p><p>Robinhood missed the bull's-eye in its market debut. The popular investing platform began trading on the Nasdaq Thursday after pricing its IPO at $38 a share, at the bottom of its expected range. The company and its bankers pegged Robinhood's value at about $32 billion. Breaking with a Wall Street convention of giving individual investors only a minuscule slice of hot IPOs, Robinhood sold between 20% and 25% of its offering to its customers, The Wall Street Journal reported. Robinhood shares tumbled 8.4% below its initial public offering price Thursday.</p><p>SPOTIFY TECHNOLOGY SA</p><p>SPOT -5.7%</p><p>Not enough new listeners are tuning in to Spotify. The streaming service added fewer total users than expected in the recent quarter, as people in its established markets emerged from pandemic-related lockdowns. The company said Covid-19 weighed on performance in several of its emerging markets -- mainly India, Brazil and Southeast Asia -- and that it paused marketing campaigns in some instances. Still, Spotify's advertising revenue more than doubled in the most recent quarter, helped by podcast offerings from Joe Rogan and Bill Simmons. Spotify shares fell 5.7% Wednesday.</p><p>WALT DISNEY CO.</p><p>DIS -0.4%</p><p>Black Widow is fighting a new battle in court. Scarlett Johansson, star of the latest Marvel movie, \"Black Widow,\" filed a lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court against Disney. Ms. Johansson alleges her contract was breached when the media giant released the film on its Disney+ streaming service at the same time as its theatrical debut. Her salary was based in large part on the box-office performance, the suit said. A Disney spokesman said the company fully complied with her contract. Disney shares lost 0.4% Thursday.</p>",
