  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Arts in Review -- Music Review:  On 'Sour,' a  Taste of Talent  ---  The introspective album from Olivia Rodrigo  proves that she's no one-hit wonder  ----  By Mark Richardson",
  "text": "<p>   Olivia Rodrigo is a little under five months into her solo recording career and she's already made history. On Jan. 8, she released her debut single, \"Drivers License,\" a moody ballad about lost love, and it was an instant sensation. It immediately leaped to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for eight weeks -- one of only a handful of times an artist's first single has topped the chart, and the first time one has lasted so long in the pole position. Ms. Rodrigo, who was 17 years old when \"Drivers License\" came out and turned 18 in February, was already famous to young audiences as an actress in \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\" on Disney+. She'd recorded as part of the cast and appeared on the show's soundtrack album. But her existing celebrity can't fully account for the runaway success of \"Drivers License.\" On Spotify, the track is closing in on 800 million streams, an absurdly high number for a song that hasn't been out for half a year. </p><p>   \"Sour\" (Geffen/Interscope), Ms. Rodrigo's debut LP, out now, offers a more complete picture of an artist we'll be hearing from for a long time. In interviews the singer has characterized herself as a musical omnivore, but the artistic lineage of her own work is well-defined. The songs are mostly ballads, the subject is fleeting romance and the emotional crush of the breakup, and the hushed style is built on intimacy. One of Ms. Rodrigo's heroes is Taylor Swift, and the influence is obvious even though their music sounds very different. The fourth track here, \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,\" borrows elements from a composition by Ms. Swift, who with her frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff gets a credit. Vocally, Ms. Rodrigo is indebted to the vowel-mangling indie-pop diction popularized by Australian singer Lorde and the whispered closeness of Billie Eilish. </p><p>   In a Billboard interview, Ms. Rodrigo's songwriting partner and producer Daniel Nigro said he gravitates toward \"music you listen to by yourself\" and gets particular satisfaction from helping artists realize such songs. \"Sour\" is filled with tunes of this kind, aimed at those who are currently in the throes of teenage heartbreak or have a clear memory of what it felt like. This is music for indoors, designed to be experienced through earbuds, smartphone speakers and laptops. </p><p>   The first track on \"Sour,\" \"Brutal,\" is a scene-setter but also a bit of an anomaly, as Ms. Rodrigo speak-sings about adolescent misery over a crunchy pop-punk arrangement. \"If someone tells me one more time / 'Enjoy your youth,' I'm gonna cry\" she shouts in one line, later adding \"I'm anxious and nothing can help\" and \"I wish people liked me more.\" It's an awkward-years dispatch whose details could apply to millions of teenagers; and it feels convincing on record, even if the person delivering the message is in reality a wealthy pop star who currently graces the covers of several magazines. </p><p>   \"Drivers License\" and advance single \"Deja Vu\" are two of the album's best songs and both draw on something Ms. Rodrigo learned from Ms. Swift: Lyrical details heighten emotion. On the former, as Ms. Rodrigo motors through neighborhoods she moves between describing her own feelings and providing fragments of what led to this moment of sadness, and the specificity of her images (\"I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing / Over all the noise\") turns what could have been a cliche into something that feels fresh and real. On the more upbeat \"Deja Vu,\" which reached the top 10, she sees an ex-boyfriend with a new flame enjoying all the things they used to do, and wonders if he's thinking about the experiences they once shared (\"And I bet that she knows Billy Joel / 'Cause you played her 'Uptown Girl'\"). </p><p>   Ms. Rodrigo's vocal phrasing is warm and conversational but less compelling when she's trying to imbue a song with attitude. \"Jealously, Jealously,\" which appears late in the set, sounds as if she's aiming for the strutting verve of an uptempo Lana Del Ray tune, but her tone is a bit too gentle to pull it off. The one lyrical stumble comes on the record's last track, \"Hope Ur OK,\" its lone outwardly facing moment. Here, Ms. Rodrigo sings of people she's encountered and lost touch with who were having a hard time -- a boy abused by his parents, a girl whose childhood dreams were crushed -- and wishes them well. Her delivery is moving but the sentiment is ultimately trite, suggesting that introspection is her strongest creative tool at this point. </p><p>   Still, the musical craft on \"Sour\" never flags -- Ms. Rodrigo and Mr. Nigro have a strong sense of melody, pacing and arrangement. The bulk of \"Sour\" was recorded at his home studio, and it sounds handmade but also assembled with care. Sometimes its coffeehouse ambience is a little too tasteful -- for an album about teenage life written and performed by a teenager, it comes over as quite polite and grown-up, as if designed to appeal to kids and their parents equally. Here and there, one yearns for the bass-heavy quake of Ms. Eilish's music, or Lorde's ingratiating sneer. But that's not the kind of record Ms. Rodrigo wanted to make -- at least this time out. </p><p>   \"Sour\" presents a highly specific persona operating within narrow thematic parameters and it works well on its own terms, proving that massive first single was anything but a fluke. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Richardson is the Journal's rock and pop music critic. </p><p></p>",
