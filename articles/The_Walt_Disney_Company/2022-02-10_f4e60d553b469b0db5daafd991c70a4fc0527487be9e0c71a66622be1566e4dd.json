  "title": "NBCUniversal poised to yank new episodes of its shows from Hulu",
  "text": "<p>Starting this fall, new episodes of shows like “The Voice,” “Saturday Night Live” and “American Auto” would no longer be available on Hulu soon after they air as a result of that plan, they said.</p><p>NBCUniversal has taken many steps recently to strengthen Peacock, which has struggled to establish itself in a crowded environment. The move would also be the latest indication of the changing relationship between Hulu's co-owners — Walt Disney Co. DIS and NBCUniversal — which went from streaming partners to direct competitors in recent years.</p><p>Comcast CMCSA, which owns a third of Hulu, launched Peacock less than two years ago, while Disney , which owns the rest, introduced Disney+ in late 2019. The two new services have had varying fortunes: Disney on Wednesday said&#xa0; Disney+ had nearly 130 million subscribers &#xa0;globally, while NBCU last month said&#xa0; over 9 million people were paying for Peacock , which is available free of charge to subscribers of Comcast and other cable providers. Peacock also offers a no-frills, ad-supported version that is free to anyone.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com. </p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Want to raise a Super Bowl quarterback?
