  "title": "How James Cameron's Water Obsession Led to the 'Avatar' Sequel; Diving into the director's career-long fascination with undersea worlds from 'The Abyss' to 'Titanic'",
  "text": "<p>\"Financial pressure. Studio pressure. Actual hyperbaric pressure of the water medium. Yeah, we were trying to survive and film,\" the director, 68, said. \"Water was an adversary for the most part.\"</p><p>Mr. Cameron has made peace with the element as a movie setting with \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" the ballyhooed sequel arriving 13 years after the $2.9 billion-grossing first installment. In a massive tank where he could control artificial waves, currents and shoals, cameras captured actors performing free of scuba gear, playing characters at home in the reefs of the moon Pandora. This was the raw material for Mr. Cameron's maximalist combination of live action and computer-generated imagery. The new movie is a three-hour tour of a world where aqua-skinned characters swim in harmony with alien sea life, then go to war for survival.</p><p>It's also the marine fantasy of an ocean explorer—one whose day job is to make three more \"Avatar\" movies for a planned total of five.</p><p>The first \"Avatar,\" which has made more money in ticket sales than any movie, wowed people with its lush photorealistic worldbuilding. Marathon scenes of characters flying astride dragon-like beasts were designed more to transport audiences than to advance the movie's plot, Mr. Cameron said. Thirteen years later, he and Walt Disney Co. (releasing the sequel through its 20th Century Studios) are betting people will dive back into a franchise taking them to a new place.</p><p>\"Water is the wonder that flying was in the first movie,\" said \"Avatar\" producer Jon Landau, Mr. Cameron's filmmaking partner and sometimes diving companion.</p><p>Potential ticket buyers take note: \"The Way of Water\" takes about an hour to get to the water.</p><p>The main characters from the first film, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a former marine living as a tribal leader of the blue Na'vi people, and his warrior wife, Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), are forced to flee their forest clan with their four children.</p><p>They find temporary refuge with the Metkayina, a tribe of island-dwelling Na'vi. They have propulsive tails and other body features adapted for swimming with sea creatures they ride like horses and treat like family members. Digital stars of the movie include whale-like beasts called tulkun that communicate with the Na'vi. This realm becomes the latest battleground in Mr. Cameron's big-budget allegory about ecosystems under threat by humans.</p><p>Harnessing water</p><p>From swimming in bioluminescent swarms to an aquatic showdown in the movie's final act, the characters' movement in water shapes much of the action. Before shooting began five years ago, filmmakers faced a major fork in the road: whether to film the actors performing in water, or suspended on wires. Mr. Cameron, the \"Titanic\" director who made 33 personal visits to the Titanic wreck, surprised nobody by taking a stand against a simulation on wires.</p><p>\"If you're hanging in a gimbal, you're using all your strength just to pretend to be blissfully floating. That's not truthful acting,\" he said.</p><p>Others on his production team were more skeptical, including Mr. Landau, who said he was unsure that cast members could pull off the kind of acting required—looking natural in and under water with no breathing gear.</p><p>Bailey Bass, the actress who plays Tsireya, a teen reef-dweller who teaches the newcomers about underwater endurance, said she did five months of water training before filming any scenes.</p><p>Kate Winslet, who plays Tsireya's mother, a pregnant leader of the Metkayina named Ronal, used the word \"peaceful\" to describe her experiences in the \"Avatar\" tank. Some scenes called for her to hold her breath under the surface for several minutes at a stretch.</p><p>She said it was a contrast to the struggles with water she went through with Mr. Cameron on \"Titanic,\" with chaotic scenes in flooding rooms and corridors. \"There was always that element of the unknown with moving water, people in it and shit-tons of floating furniture. It was always really scary,\" Ms. Winslet recalled. Despite the safety protocols on that set in the late 1990s, she said, \"there was only so much they could do before it was in the laps of the gods.\"</p><p>Risky innovation</p><p>\"The Abyss\" taught Mr. Cameron hard lessons about submerging cast and crew members in the drink. Written by Mr. Cameron, the movie is about a team of underwater oil workers that encounters aliens during a mission to a lost nuclear sub.</p><p>The project demanded multiple innovations, including underwater lighting rigs, diving helmets that provided visibility of the actors' faces and a system for recording underwater dialogue. With aquatic filming expert Al Giddings and cinematographer Mikael Salomon, Mr. Cameron shot the movie in a repurposed nuclear containment tank in South Carolina.</p><p>\"I cannot believe, looking back on it, that anyone said yes to this,\" said producer Gale Anne Hurd, who had also worked with Mr. Cameron on \"The Terminator\" and \"Aliens.\"</p><p>A cascade of problems plagued the \"Abyss\" production, such as a seizing filtration system and equipment failures that forced everyone into night shoots underwater.</p><p>Lead actor Ed Harris had a mishap with breathing gear that made him fear for his life, he said in a behind-the-scenes documentary titled \"Under Pressure\" (produced by Mr. Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment).</p><p>\"Nobody was in jeopardy of dying. I know people thought they were. But that also worked toward their character,\" Ms. Hurd says now. \"Everybody reached their breaking point.\"</p><p>The director can be heard in the documentary shouting at people through the underwater communication system. Mr. Cameron routinely spent entire shooting days submerged in scuba gear, which required hours of decompression before he could safely exit the tank. He used that waiting time underwater to review film footage. \"He expected people in the cast and the crew to understand how hard this was and to get with the program. As difficult as they were having it, it was 10 times worse for him,\" said Ms. Hurd, who was going through a divorce from Mr. Cameron at the time.</p><p>A water mantra</p><p>\"The Abyss\" took place in dark ocean depths. The new \"Avatar\" sequel explores an alien version of the shallows, a sun-dappled zone teeming with life.</p><p>\"I've experienced that biodiversity all over the world. I've also seen it degraded, unfortunately,\" said Mr. Cameron, who has also produced and directed multiple documentaries about ocean life and exploration. Through an \"Avatar\" promotion in which users create virtual creatures, Disney is donating up to $1 million to a Nature Conservancy oceans program.</p><p>The \"Way of Water\" subtitle comes from a mantra the characters use in the film as they fill their lungs and slow their heart rates to stay relaxed underwater. Written by Mr. Cameron, the lines were inspired by the ethos of free divers who go down without breathing gear (including the filmmaker, who said he has swum to depths of 135 feet). To prepare for dives, they typically count their way through meditative breathing exercises.</p><p>\"I thought, what if you're not counting? What if you're saying a prayer?\" Mr. Cameron said.</p><p>That feeling ties back to his earliest memories of immersion, around age 9, before he got into scuba and submersibles. In Chippewa, the Canadian town where he grew up, people would leap into the Welland River, which flows through on its way to nearby Niagara Falls. For the future filmmaker who would make water a recurring theme in his life's work, the ritual plunge happened each year around June, \"as early as humanly possible,\" when the river was still frigid.</p><p>\"We'd all stand around shivering and blue-lipped,\" Mr. Cameron said, \"and then jump in again.\"</p><p>Write to John Jurgensen at John.Jurgensen@wsj.com</p><p>More in film:</p><p>* How 'Avatar,' 'Black Panther' Movies Taught Stars to Act Underwater</p><p>* In 'Glass Onion,' an Art Collection That Says 'Rich Jerk'</p><p>* How Will Ferrell Became the King of Christmas</p><p>* Now in a Theater Near You: Cannibalism, Vomit and Severed Fingers</p><p>* Candace Cameron Bure Wants to Put Christianity Back in Christmas Movies</p><p>How James Cameron's Water Obsession Led to the 'Avatar' Sequel</p>",
