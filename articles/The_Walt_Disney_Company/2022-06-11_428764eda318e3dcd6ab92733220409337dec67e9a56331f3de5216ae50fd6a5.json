  "text": "<p>Nobuyuki Idei's tenure as Sony's top executive from 1995 to 2005 could be viewed as one of the biggest business failures of the internet age -- or as the precursor to the company's current success.</p><p>Mr. Idei, who died of liver failure on June 2 at age 84, was a visionary in many respects. He told The Wall Street Journal in 1997 that he envisioned Sony, then known mainly as a manufacturer of televisions and audio equipment, as a rival to Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros.</p><p>Last month, Sony Group Corp. Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida pointed to a milestone that vindicated his old boss: In the year ended March 2022, Sony's three entertainment businesses -- videogames, music and video content such as movies -- accounted for more than half the company's revenue for the first time.</p><p>These entertainment businesses accounted for two-thirds of operating income, which helped Sony recover its spot as Japan's second most valuable company by market capitalization after Toyota Motor Corp.</p><p>Mr. Idei fell short in tackling the biggest threat to Sony's dominance of tech hardware: Apple Inc. Sony had invented the Walkman, and new technologies to deliver music should have been its bread and butter. Instead, Apple was the pioneer with its iPod, and the key was combining hardware and software.</p>",
