  "text": "<p>(Netflix)</p><p>\"Army of Thieves,\" Netflix's follow-up to zombie heist film \"Army of the Dead,\" isn't really a zombie movie at all, which just might make it the perfect film for families split between those who must keep up with the Zack Snyder franchise and those who can't deal with horror at all.</p><p>\"Army of Thieves,\" out Friday on Netflix, is a comedy heist prequel to \"Dead,\" and the origin story of how a German bank teller named Sebastian becomes the safecracker known as Ludwig Dieter in \"Dead.\" It takes place in Europe at the dawn of the zombie outbreak in the U.S. The film stars and is directed by Matthias Schweighöfer. He plays Sebastian, who is haunted by visions and dreams of the zombie apocalypse. Mr. Snyder is one of the film's producers.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What shows and movies are you watching this Halloween season? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Sebastian is enlisted by the stylish and talented thief Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel of \"Game of Thrones\") to help her band of misfit criminals on their next job. Their next targets are three safes whose locks, it is said, can only be solved by \"those who are worthy of the secrets they guarded\" and whose contents are incinerated if they are attempted to be opened by force. It is a comedic, self-referential love letter to big-budget heist films such as \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"The Italian Job\" that put together crews of characters to pull off big jobs.</p><p>\"Is it like in a movie film where each one of us has a different skill set and it's only working together that we can pull off that which needs the pulling off?\" Sebastian asks after he meets the crew.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Gwendoline says, \"it's exactly like that.\"</p><p>Asked what the departure of \"Thieves\" from the gloomier \"Dead\" says about the possibilities of the franchise's future, Mr. Schweighöfer says it means any genre is possible: \"No expectations, it could be everything everywhere.\"</p><p>\"I think the DNA of these films is, even if you're insecure and there's nothing secure around you, you have to get up and fight, whatever the fight is,\" he says.</p><p>New Release: 'Welcome to the Blumhouse'</p><p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>Prime Video released four new titles in its \"Welcome to the Blumhouse\" anthology of thriller and horror films this month. Among them are \"Black as Night,\" a vampire tale set in New Orleans; \"Bingo Hell,\" about a group of elderly friends whose beloved bingo hall has a new owner; and \"Madres,\" about a young couple who move to a California ranch that is rich with secrets.</p><p>Even before the introduction of any paranormal elements, even before the aging Judith begins to see visions of a malevolent creature in her room, \"The Manor\" is a horror story. Judith, played by Barbara Hershey, suffers a stroke. Fearing that she is losing control of her mind and that death is on the horizon, she moves to a nursing home.</p><p>\"It is stuff that we can relate to,\" Ms. Hershey says, \"and it's much more horrifying than some haunted house on a hill, you know?\"</p><p>Ms. Hershey, who hasn't done much horror in her career, says she doesn't care what the genre is, as long as the story and characters are compelling. She was attracted to Judith because, although the character was struggling with her health, she wasn't presented as a clichéd portrait of a feeble old lady.</p><p>\"She was a whole human being,\" she says, \"and I thought that was kind of sadly revolutionary.\"</p><p>An Expert Recommends: 'Troll 2'</p><p>(Pluto TV)</p><p>Rainn Wilson, best known for his role as Dwight Schrute on NBC's \"The Office,\" plays a video-store clerk in Payne Lindsey's paranormal podcast, \"Radio Rental.\" Here, he recommends a movie he believes should be a Halloween tradition. Edited from an interview.</p><p>\"I've always loved really bad movies and I've always loved the paranormal, mysterious tales and spooky stories. The movie that I always come back to around Halloween is one of my very favorites, 'Troll 2.' I'm sure the first time I saw it was on VHS in the late '90s, and then after I saw the documentary about it—'Best Worst Movie' (Pluto TV, Tubi)—I had to go back and watch it again.</p><p>\"It's such a delicious train wreck and you can watch it on so many different levels that it really should be a Halloween tradition, kind of like 'It's a Wonderful Life' is over Christmas and New Year's.</p><p>\"It's hard to describe what the plot is, but a family essentially stumbles upon a small town that is kind of haunted by these vegetarian goblins that seek to turn people into trees. It goes from kind of grotesque '70s horror to outrageous comedy and back and forth all the time with some of the most delicious, worst acting you've ever seen.\"</p><p>Screaming Notes:</p><p>—\"Halloween Kills,\" the latest installment in the \"Halloween\" franchise, is streaming on Peacock. Star Jamie Lee Curtis recently told the Journal that, though the horror franchise made her career, she can't watch horror movies. \"I have zero affection for the horror genre.\"</p><p>—Lois Duncan's novel \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" inspired the classic '90s slasher starring Jennifer Love Hewitt of the same name (streaming on Peacock). That grew into a three-movie franchise. Now Amazon Prime Video has adapted Ms. Duncan's novel for a TV series, which premiered earlier this month.</p><p>—\"Muppets Haunted Mansion,\" billed as the Muppets's first Halloween special, is streaming now on Disney+.</p><p>—Kiernan Shipka (\"Mad Men,\" \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\") headlines the thriller \"Treat,\" a 90-minute audio drama—what the producers are calling a \"podcast movie\"—about a teenage girl who feels out of place in her seemingly perfect town that reeeeeally isn't perfect.</p><p>What to Watch This Halloween: 10 Scary, Chilling and Terrifying Movies, Shows and Stories to Stream</p>",
