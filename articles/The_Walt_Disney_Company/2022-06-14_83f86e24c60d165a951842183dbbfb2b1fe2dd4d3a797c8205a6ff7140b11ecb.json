  "text": "<p>ITV has bought a majority stake in a natural history programme maker that has produced shows for Netflix and Disney, as the UK broadcaster seeks to tap into demand for more factual nature content from the world's biggest streaming groups. </p> <p>Plimsoll Productions, which is making the upcoming <em>A Year on Planet Earth</em> for ITV, China's Tencent, Fox Nation in the US and Ard Group in Germany, has previously created <em>Night on Earth</em> and <em>Animal</em> for Netflix, as well as <em>Hostile Planet</em> for Disney.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/c739fda4-ba82-466e-9ff5-d4a939263b23\">ITV</a> has acquired a 79.5 per cent stake in the independent group for £103.5mn from LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, and Plimsoll founder and chief executive Grant Mansfield. </p> <p>“Natural history programming is incredibly . . . global and we're obviously a big global player,” said Julian Bellamy, managing director of ITV Studios, a consortium of 60 production companies that create and distribute programming. </p> <p>He said the deal was part of ITV's strategy to diversify its studio business and become more appealing to streaming platforms as they commission more nature content. </p> <p>“We believe natural history and more broadly . . . blue-chip factual programming is a growth area in the business. Netflix, Apple, Disney . . .[are] commissioning ambitious natural history,” he added. </p> <p>Plimsoll was founded in Bristol by Mansfield in 2013. The company will now sit within ITV Studios. Mansfield will retain a 20.5 per cent stake alongside other members of Plimsoll's management team and the company's “strategic investors”. ITV said it had the option of acquiring the outstanding 20.5 per cent of Plimsoll's shares for an amount dependent on the production company's profit growth in the period to the end of 2027, and up to a cap of £79.5mn.</p> <p>ITV said Plimsoll is forecast to deliver earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of about £5.5mn in the first half of 2022. The company delivered earnings of £10mn in the year to August 2021.</p> <p>“The significant opportunities in the international premium unscripted market make this the perfect time for Plimsoll to join ITV Studios,” said Mansfield. “There is a quite special strategic and cultural fit that will enable us to achieve our, now shared, creative and commercial ambitions for Plimsoll.”</p><p>Source: Leke Oso Alabi 2022 'ITV goes back to nature to tap into demand from streamers' FT.com 14 June.
