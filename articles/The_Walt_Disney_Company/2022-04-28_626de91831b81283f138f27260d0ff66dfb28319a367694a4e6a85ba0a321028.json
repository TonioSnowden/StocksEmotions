  "text": "<p>Comcast has announced its largest return of capital to shareholders as the US group posted strong subscriber growth in its Peacock streaming service and benefited from the return of sporting mega-events and a post-pandemic boost to its theme parks. &#xa0;</p> <p>Philadelphia-based Comcast is one of the last fully fledged media and telecoms conglomerates, offering cable and broadband alongside entertainment including films and television. </p> <p>The company reported a 9 per cent increase in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, at $9.2bn in the first quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations of $8.8bn. Revenue rose 14 per cent to $31bn.</p> <p>Comcast said it would return $4.2bn to shareholders, including $3bn in share repurchases and $1.2bn in dividend payments, increasing the latter for the 13th year in a row.</p> <p>TV and music streaming companies are facing a reckoning after Netflix last week revealed its subscriber growth had stalled for the first time in a decade, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd376c16-f8d7-49fd-9b13-9ed2f001eaa1\">shaking confidence in the business model</a> of rivals that had sought to emulate the company's strategy.</p> <p>Comcast's NBCUniversal division, which is embroiled in a streaming war with the likes of Netflix and Disney, posted a 46.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in revenue to $10.3bn, and a 7.4 per cent increase in adjusted ebitda, to $1.6bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>It recorded strong growth in its Peacock streaming service, with paid subscribers increasing from 9mn to 13mn, bolstered in part by the popularity of coverage of the Olympic Games and Super Bowl.</p> <p>Revenue in the company's theme parks division jumped 152 per cent to $1.6bn.</p> <p>The company said on Wednesday that it had formed a joint venture with Charter Communications to develop a streaming platform for devices and smart TVs, with the underlying technology licensed by Comcast, and $900mn provided by Charter.</p> <p>In its core cable business, Comcast added only 262,000 new broadband customers — a record low for the company.</p> <p>However, it gained 318,000 mobile customers — its highest number since it launched the service in 2017.</p> <p>The company's acquisition of Sky in 2018 allowed it to develop an international footprint, but it faced an uphill battle last year as higher costs and disruption to sports during the coronavirus pandemic hindered growth at the European broadcasting and broadband group.</p> <p>Although revenue in the UK-based business was down by about 5 per cent — in large part because of a loss of customers in Italy — adjusted ebitda was up 71 per cent to $622mn.</p> <p>Shares in Comcast have fallen more than 15 per cent since the start of the year, including a 4 per cent fall to $42.64 in morning New York trading. </p><p>Source: Anna Gross in London 2022 'Comcast boosts dividends as Peacock streaming subscribers grow ' FT.com 28 April.
