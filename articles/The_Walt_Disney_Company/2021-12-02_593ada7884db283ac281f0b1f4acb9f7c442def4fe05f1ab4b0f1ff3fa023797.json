  "title": "What to Stream: Three New Releases To Catch",
  "text": "<p>(Disney+)</p><p>A new one-hour animated film that begins streaming Friday on Disney+, \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" is about Greg Heffley and his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, as they transition to middle school: the classes, the bullies, the lunchroom and, of course, the dreaded \"cheese touch.\" It is based on the first novel in Jeff Kinney's book series that has sold more than 250 million copies world-wide.</p><p>The book was previously adapted for the screen as part of the four live-action feature films released between 2010 and 2017. This time, the screenplay was written solely by Mr. Kinney. It is the first in an animated reboot of the franchise for Disney+. The next film, \"Rodrick Rules,\" is scheduled for 2022.</p><p>Writing the screenplays for the animated films himself, Mr. Kinney says, has given him an opportunity to \"tell the stories in a better way than they're told on the page.\"</p><p>\"I started writing 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' when I was 28 years old and writing a good story was never an imperative to me. I was trying to write a funny story. I was trying to tell lots and lots of jokes,\" says Mr. Kinney, who added: \"Only now, at book 16, would I say I'm a capable novelist.\"</p><p>'Harlem'</p><p>(Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>Tracy Oliver always enjoyed \"Sex and the City,\" but when she went to create her own show about single women in New York who share the intimate details of their dating lives and careers with each other, she wanted it to reflect the unique experiences of Black women like herself.</p><p>Among the conundrums: If you are a Black woman who is interested in dating Black men, she says, the numbers game can \"get a little dire.\" If you are open to dating white men and someone who is interested in you on a dating app has dated Black women before, \"then you're like: wait, do you have a fetish or do you really like me and am I overthinking this?\"</p><p>But more important to her than the love lives of the four women at the center of \"Harlem,\" Ms. Oliver says, is the relationship they have with each other. \"I'm really attracted to the relationships of friends and how we can kind of be real and honest in a way that other relationships aren't,\" she says.</p><p>\"Harlem\" begins streaming Friday.</p><p>'The Beautiful Liar'</p><p>(Various)</p><p>When Sam Harris and his band, X Ambassadors, were making their most recent album, \"The Beautiful Liar,\" he says he felt a narrative structure developing around the songs. So he decided to turn them into something more than \"just a bunch of songs put together in a playlist.\"</p><p>\"The Beautiful Liar,\" a scripted podcast inspired by the album, starring Mr. Harris alongside Emily Hampshire of \"Schitt's Creek,\" is streaming now on Spotify and other podcast providers. It is a story about a blind teenager named Clementine (Rory Anne Dahl) who discovers that she has special powers and a voice inside her head known as \"The Shadow\" (Ms. Hampshire). She has to manage both while she also manages being a teenager.</p>",
