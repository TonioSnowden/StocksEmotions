  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Disney Magic Makers to Relocate",
  "text": "<p>Relocations rarely go smoothly, but the news has hit the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products division especially hard, according to employees and people familiar with the matter. The moves are expected to affect those in consumer products, licensing and other divisions.</p><p>The announcement of the shift to Florida comes after nearly 18 months of upheaval in Disney's parks operation, brought on by Covid-19 and marked by monthslong closures, fights with public officials and the layoff of more than 30,000 employees. Most worked in the 1parks.</p><p>Selling the workers on the relocation is a key test for Bob Chapek, now 17 months into his tenure as chief executive, and the deputies he has elevated to lead parks, still the company's largest division.</p><p>Mr. Chapek and his executive team are following through on relocation plans that started in 2019, when the CEO was running the parks division, but were delayed after Covid-19 spread throughout 2020. The company continued to work on building its new Florida location throughout the pandemic. Though Disney's narrative on Wall Street has lately focused on its streaming efforts, any change to the parks that are beloved by consumers and protected by employees carries symbolic resonance.</p><p>That is especially true for the Imagineers, which have become one of Disney's most revered and mysterious workforces. Since their founding in the mid-20th century, the Imagineers have been credited by fans and Walt Disney himself with innovating some of the signature touches found in Disney theme parks.</p><p>Disney could get an estimated $570 million in tax breaks over 20 years, according to a person familiar with the matter, on a project whose capital investment could reach $864 million. The tax break is being used to lure Disney to Lake Nona, a mixed-use development about 20 miles from Walt Disney World and home to new locations for Cisco, General Electric Co. and several other major companies. A 17-square-mile self-described \"modern mecca\" near the Orlando airport, Lake Nona is home to corporate campuses, four schools and several subdivisions for houses ranging from $400,000 three-bedrooms to $1 million-plus mansions still under construction.</p><p>The tax-credit program has targeted blue-chip companies that will move white-collar jobs to the state, and the average wage of Disney employees being relocated to Lake Nona is about $120,000, according to the Orlando Economic Partnership.</p><p>The Orlando Sentinel first reported details of Disney's tax-break estimates.</p><p>The costly nature of Disney's new office points to the sophistication of the tech operations moving there. The Imagineers in particular have come to be known as a Disney brain trust, with new employees joining from Google Inc. or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p><p>As the scope of Disney's parks division has grown, smaller groups of Imagineers have been based in Florida, Shanghai and other parts of the world. With this most recent announcement, the largest concentration of Imagineers will no longer be based in Southern California for the first time since their founding.</p><p>Imagineer projects have included the Haunted Mansion and Soarin' Around the World as well as newer additions such as the Avengers Campus and a \"Zootopia\"-themed land. Employees are immersed in the Imagineer way: to constantly \"plus\" their work -- that is, make every detail a bit better -- and think of each project in a \"blue sky\" way with no limitations.</p><p>Josh D'Amaro, the Disney executive overseeing the relocation, recently ended a parks presentation with a clip of Imagineers watching a walking robotic \"Groot\" from the film \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\" And then he wielded a \"Star Wars\" lightsaber.</p><p>\"It's real,\" he added, two words that sent online fandoms into frantic speculation over what the Imagineers were cooking up. Patent applications routinely stream out of the division, many dissected by parks disciples for clues about what changes might be afoot.</p><p>In announcing the change, Mr. D'Amaro, head of Disney's parks, experiences and products division since May 2020, said the decision didn't come lightly since he had moved his own family across the country while climbing Disney's ranks. He cited Florida's business-friendly climate in announcing the move and pointed out to employees that the state offered a lower cost of living with no state income tax.</p>",
