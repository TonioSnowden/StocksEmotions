  "text": "<p>Supply crisis? Staff shortages? Inflation? What of them? The UK's largest supermarket <strong>Tesco</strong> published its half-year results this morning and the problems that have hit the headlines in recent weeks are conspicuous by their absence from the statement. </p> <p>Instead, Tesco upgraded its full-year earnings forecast, announced a £500m share buyback and set out a new set of strategic priorities. </p> <p>Statutory pre-tax profits doubled from the first six months of last financial year to £1.1bn while adjusting operating profits in its retail division were around 16 per cent higher at £1.4bn. Tesco said that for the full year it now expects adjusted retail operating profit to be between £2.5bn and £2.6bn. Before it had only predicted a “strong recovery in profitability”. </p> <p>Tesco said its “market outperformance” was in part due to the strength of its supply chains as others' came under pressure. It also said that “at a minimum” it was seeking to “offset the impact of cost inflation on our business each year” as part of its new strategic priorities, with £1bn in gross cost savings identified through “simplification”.</p> <p>For more on Tesco's results click <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/436fb11b-3884-4663-b64c-05be8e4b0201\">here</a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Tui</strong>, the travel group, is raising another €1.1bn in capital from shareholders through a rights issue designed to shore up its balance sheet. The fully underwritten issue is priced at a 35.1 per cent discount to the theoretical rights issue price and will result in 10 new shares being issued for every 21 existing shares. Tui's biggest shareholder has backed the issue. </p> <p>The accounting watchdog has announced that it is investigating <strong>Mazars'</strong> 2020 audit of <strong>French Connection</strong>, two days after the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/french-connection-sold-in-deal-valuing-business-at-29m-after-years-of-losses-12425738\">group was sold</a> in a deal valuing it at £29m. </p> <p>Recruiter <strong>PageGroup </strong>is riding the recruitment boom. It upgraded profit guidance after a third quarter when revenues were up 65 per cent on last year and 13 per cent on the year before. Also out today are quarterly trading updates from tobacco group <strong>Imperial Brands</strong>, car dealer <strong>Lookers </strong>and retailer <strong>Topps Tiles</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Amazon</strong> has launched its first <strong>“4-star”</strong> retail shop in the UK, a 3,500 square foot store in the Bluewater shopping centre which sells a range of books, toys, homeware and Amazon devices based on reviews on the company's website. Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/393a6b27-31d2-412a-92da-6ebc1e743f8f\">retail correspondent Jonathan Eley reports</a> that while the store offers click-and-collect and returns for online Amazon orders, the number of products it has in stock is small: only around 2,000 compared to between 5,000 and 20,000 at an Argos branch.</p> <p>Sanjeev Gupta's <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> has vowed legal action to block a “predatory” attempt by a US private equity group to take control of Europe's largest aluminium smelter, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3246bf25-1c5b-4137-91ea-824f3db62fe9\">Anna Gross and Sylvia Pfeifer report</a>.</p> <p>The <strong>UK gender pay gap</strong> has widened despite pressure from government and campaign groups for companies to increase the number of women in senior roles. The average pay gap in finance and insurance, education technology and energy all rose between 2018 and 2020. The FT has an excellent interactive chart where you can see how your employer compares — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239c95cc-d34f-43e9-a61e-faa7954277b6\">check it out here</a>. </p> <p>And <strong>Ofcom</strong> has set out rules for regulating <strong>TikTok, Snap</strong> and <strong>Only Fans</strong> — but because the rules only apply to video streaming services with a regional HQ in the UK, YouTube, Netflix and Disney will be left out. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>In case you hadn't got the message already, <strong>private equity firms</strong> are flush with cash. They are offering the highest premiums for listed companies in more than two decades, our private capital correspondent Kaye Wiggins reports. In the US buyout groups have paid average premiums of 42 per cent this year, the highest since 1999, while in Europe it's been 45 per cent, the highest since data company Refinitiv's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69c28c74-e957-4009-912a-aee1c452995d\">records began in 1980</a>.</p> <p>“Ethical shoemaker” <strong>Allbirds</strong> has rowed back on some of the sustainability commitments it made ahead of its planned IPO. The Californian group said in its IPO prospectus in August that it would adhere to a “sustainability principles and objectives framework” developed with a consultancy group, but in an update filed on Monday, the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27dc4a15-c313-4238-90fc-9e7a2b1c8ca0\">removed several key references</a> to the framework from the document. </p> <p>And <strong>Apple suppliers</strong> are warning that further disruptions to energy supplies in China could wreak havoc in the <strong>tech supply chain</strong> just as the industry gears up for peak production season. Several companies — including key Apple suppliers — have already had to halt or reduce operations at facilities in China's industrial tech heartland after local governments restricted the supply of electricity for commercial use, our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbdd0fb0-9ac6-47b5-ad2f-2c23e8245e92\">colleagues from Nikkei report</a>. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Not strictly comment but well worth a read all the same is this piece by Radio 4 presenter Lynsey Hanley: “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e2c1eda-9c6f-4dfc-a79c-5186b1d423ad\">A nation of property hoarders</a> — how Right to Buy transformed UK housing”.</p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Bullish Tesco defies supply chain crunch and cost pressures' FT.com 6 October.
