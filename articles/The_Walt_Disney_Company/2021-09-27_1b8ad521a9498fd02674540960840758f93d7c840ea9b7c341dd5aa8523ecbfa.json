  "title": "CAA to Buy Rival Talent Agency ICM Partners in Hollywood Shake-Up; The move furthers consolidation of talent deal making in Hollywood; financial terms aren't disclosed",
  "text": "<p>It caps a tumultuous few years in Hollywood where consumer demand for streaming, videogames and social media has forced entertainment companies to bulk up and focus more on subscribers than on box-office tallies. Caught up in the flurry are the A-list stars who are finding that retaining fame requires more than just starring in the latest blockbuster or network TV show—forcing their agents to provide services from tech investing to blockchain.</p><p>For actors, musicians and their representatives, the top-heavy landscape has diminished their power when negotiating for plum roles and talent deals. And the potential new agency's heft could help it exert more leverage as relations between studios and stars strain as the rules get rewritten.</p><p>Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. The companies said they expect the transaction to close later this year.</p><p>Founded in 1975, CAA has become known as the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood, responsible for shepherding the careers of movie stars and musicians—while taking a 10% cut on all deals—from its glass-faced headquarters known as \"the Death Star.\" CAA is still much smaller than its main rival, Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., which made its own news Monday, announcing it had acquired sports-betting firm OpenBet for $1.2 billion. Endeavor already has invested in businesses such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship sports league, an asset that bolstered the firm's public offering earlier this year.</p><p>The two deals, for ICM and OpenBet, speak to the divergent strategies of Hollywood's two biggest representation firms in the wake of industry deal making, including Warner Bros. Discovery, the combination of AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. announced earlier this year, and Walt Disney Co.'s acquisition of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox for $71.3 billion in 2019. Endeavor has bulked up by purchasing firms that are adjacent to entertainment, whereas CAA has doubled down on the representation business.</p><p>While CAA can't match Endeavor's scale, it retains the glitziest client roster, from Kanye West to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. The agency also has been behind some of the most lucrative entertainment deals of the past year, including a $450 million agreement with Netflix Inc. for two sequels to the murder mystery \"Knives Out.\"</p><p>A combined CAA-ICM would solidify an Hollywood ecosystem that has become largely a two-agency town, with United Talent Agency now running a more-distant third in terms of client roster and profile. Endeavor grew from the combination of the storied William Morris Agency and Endeavor, going on to buy bought fashion and sports representation firm IMG Worldwide in 2014.</p><p>The CAA-ICM deal comes as talent agencies find themselves at a crossroads. The streaming service pivot, which accelerated during the pandemic's lockdowns, has thrown into question the future for big-ticket deals that tie payouts to global box-office grosses.</p><p>The TV syndication deals that delivered checks to agencies for decades after the final episode was aired have also largely gone away. In the music industry, more than a year without live shows meant a dearth of revenue for artists and their agents—a dynamic that contributed to a March 2021 deal for entertainment power broker Casey Wasserman to acquire the North American music-representation business of Paradigm Talent Agency.</p><p>In some cases, talent agencies have responded by trying to take advantage of the seller's market for programming by launching their own production arms. But those efforts have largely been torpedoed after pushback from Hollywood unions. CAA recently sold the majority of a production arm it had started only a few years ago to South Korea's JTBC Studios Co.</p><p>As salaries tied to film and TV fall, stars such as Reese Witherspoon and Gwyneth Paltrow have perfected an entrepreneurial model that parlays their celebrity into broader brands across consumer products, licensing and other investments. Richard Lovett, CAA's co-chairman, said the evolving priorities of such clients helped drive the ICM deal, as his agency's stars look to expand into other fields and expect their agents to help them.</p><p>\"Clients need these resources in all areas,\" he said, even referencing client interest in blockchain investment.</p><p>CAA is in the fray of entertainment's shifting dynamics. Its client, Scarlett Johansson, recently sued Disney over its decision to premiere her latest movie \"Black Widow\" on its streaming service. Ms. Johansson said the decision was in violation of her contract and deprived her of tens of millions of dollars. Further consolidation is expected across Hollywood, pitting the agents against more Goliaths.</p><p>Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek last week said talent deals are undergoing a reset, having been trapped in a middle ground since many contracts were written in pre-Covid-19 times.</p><p>\"Talent deals going forward will have to reflect that the world is changing,\" he said.</p><p>ICM works in many of the same areas that CAA does, but has become known in recent years for its robust TV operation. Ms. Rhimes, creator of \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Breaking Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan are among its clients. While new projects by such clients might go directly into a streaming service deal, their old well-loved franchises provide highly valued, annuity-like revenue.</p><p>ICM also still makes money from putting together massive hits like \"Friends\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\" ICM Chief Executive Chris Silbermann will join CAA's shareholder board.</p><p>As CAA and its rivals have expanded beyond traditional representation, their ties to private-equity firms for financing their growth have deepened. In 2010, TPG Capital took a 35% stake in CAA in a deal that valued the firm at $700 million. Four years later, TPG invested $250 million to up its stake to 53%, valuing CAA at $1 billion. The firm's involvement has led observers in Hollywood to speculate on how and when it might want to exit, even through a public offering.</p><p>Write to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com and Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com</p><p>CAA to Buy Rival Talent Agency ICM Partners in Hollywood Shake-Up</p>",
