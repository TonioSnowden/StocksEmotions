  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 254 points, or 0.8% to around 32,893</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX shed 30 points, or 0.8% to around 3,798</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite went down 111 points, or 1.1% to 10,504</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1%, the S&amp;P 500 increased 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 remains down 20% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Equity indexes slipped as the results from the U.S midterm elections trickled in but the battle to control Congress remained unclear.</p><p>\"The market does not like uncertainty,\" said Todd Morgan, chairman at Bel Air Investment Advisors, adding that the market likely would have liked to see a Republican wave, as earlier anticipated.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index rallied over the past three sessions, partly on hopes that gains for the Republicans might deliver partisan gridlock in Washington.</p><p>A popular view on Wall Street has been that a divided government could be beneficial for equity valuations since it may reduce regulatory uncertainty, crimp the likelihood of more corporate taxes, and mean less government spending, which should help undercut inflation.</p><p>In turn, softer inflation could, at the margin, reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to continue to raise interest rates aggressively. The S&amp;P 500 is down nearly 20% in 2022 as the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate from effectively zero at the start of March to a range of 3.75% to 4%.</p><p>However, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin on Wednesday said the Fed shouldn't stop raising interest rates for fear of sparking an economic downturn because it risks inflation coming back even stronger, requiring even stricter measures down the road.</p><p>Still, the focus on Wall Street was midterm results and Thursday's inflation update, with theconsumer-price index for October expected to show persistently high prices compared with a year ago, despite dramatically higher rates.</p><p>See: U.S. inflation likely to post another sharp increase in October, CPI to show</p><p>In corporate earnings, Walt Disney Co. DIS and News Corp. NWSA fell after posting disappointing results while declines in big tech names including Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Nvidia Corp. NVDA weighed on the Nasdaq-100.</p><p>The 2-year U.S Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, which is particularly sensitive to monetary policy, was trading around 4.67% on Wednesday, having flirted with 15-year high near 4.75% at the beginning of the week. The dollar index DXY gained 0.4 to 110.07.</p><p>\"October CPI will be very important and consensus is looking for another 'hot print' with some seeing year-on-year surging to 9%. This shows that many armchair economists simply draw lines on both growth and acceleration,\" said Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, who added that he reckons the inflation number will come in softer than expected.</p><p>\"All in all, this keeps us constructive on stocks into year end. And we think this rally will rise further and last longer than the 23 trading day rally following June pivot talk,\" Lee said.</p><p>Investors also have been monitoring a fresh crypto wobble. Bitcoin BTCUSD was trading below $18,000 as investors digested Binance's tentative deal to acquire rival FTX.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Walt Disney Co. DIS shares plummeted almost 12% Wednesday, as the company wrapped upits fiscal year with record sales and its best revenue growth in more than 25 years, but executives predicted much slower sales increases in the year ahead while missing expectations for fourth-quarter earnings and sales.</p><p>* Meta Platforms Inc. META stock went up almost 7.5% Wednesday after chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees Wednesday that he planned to lay off about 13% of the social-media company's employee base, or 11,000 employees, as Meta works to become \"leaner.\"</p><p>* Tesla TSLA shares lost 2.2% after SEC filings showed CEO Elon Musk sold nearly$4 billion in Tesla shares in the days following his purchase of Twitter.</p><p>* DR Horton DHI stock gained 6.7% despite the home builder missing top and bottom line estimatesfor its latest quarter. It also said it would not provide guidance due to housing market uncertainty.</p><p>* AMC AMC fell almost 10% after the cinema chain reported its 12th consecutive quarterly lossand revenue that topped analysts' estimates after market close on Tuesday.</p><p>* Novavax NVAX sharesgained 1.5% Wednesday after the company on Tuesday tweaked its full-year sales outlook to the low end of its expected range and reported a surprise quarterly loss, but sales for the COVID-19 vaccine maker were far better than expected.</p><p>* Lucid Group Inc. LCID stock plunged almost 18% Wednesday after the electric-car maker reported a wider quarterly lossand sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Lucid lost $530 million, or 40 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $524 million, or 43 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</p><p>â€”Additional reporting by Jamie Chisholm</p><p>Dow falls 250 points and stocks slip as control of Congress remains unsettled</p>",
