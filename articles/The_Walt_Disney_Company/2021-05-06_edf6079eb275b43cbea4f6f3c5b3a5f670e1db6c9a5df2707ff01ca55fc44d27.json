  "title": "Costumed Performers  Face New Restrictions  ---  NYC leaders call for a  law to further rein in  characters working  the Times Square area  ----  By Ben Chapman and Paul Berger",
  "text": "<p>   As New York City tries to lure back tourists, local lawmakers and business leaders are backing legislation that would enhance restrictions on costumed street performers who pose for photos with pedestrians in Times Square. </p><p>   Under an existing law, the performers -- who sometimes dress as characters like Elmo from \"Sesame Street\" or Disney's Mickey Mouse and have been accused of harassing tourists for money -- already are confined to a designated area in Times Square. </p><p>   But local politicians and business leaders said loopholes in the law permit the performers to ply their trade beyond the restricted zones and into Manhattan's Theater District, which lies just outside the square. </p><p>   A New York City Council bill discussed in a Wednesday hearing would close the loopholes by creating a Theater District safety zone where the performers would be banned, according to the bill's sponsor, City Councilman Keith Powers. </p><p>   Mr. Powers said the current law was created in 2016 following complaints about the characters aggressively demanding tips from tourists. The city responded by creating painted zones limiting where the characters could conduct business, he said. </p><p>   In practice, Mr. Powers said, some workers interpreted the rule to mean that they could stray beyond zones to solicit business as long as they brought people back to those designated areas for payment. He said the bill would prevent that. </p><p>   \"It's about improving the pedestrian experience in Times Square,\" Mr. Powers said at the hearing. </p><p>   The bill, which also is sponsored by City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, was first introduced in November 2019, but the Covid-19 pandemic halted its progress, said a spokeswoman for Mr. Powers. </p><p>   The legislation would require the city's Department of Transportation to establish additional pedestrian areas to facilitate foot traffic in the Theater District safety zone. It  also would create a working group to ensure coordination between local businesses and the city in managing the area. </p><p>   Street performers in the area would be invited to participate in the group. The spokeswoman for Mr. Powers said lawmakers are hopeful the legislation would be voted on in the coming weeks. </p><p>   Department of Transportation Commissioner Hank Gutman said at Wednesday's hearing that expanding rules for street performers could prove challenging because of the limited space on streets surrounding Time Square. </p><p>   Regina Fojas, the senior vice president of Times Square Alliance, an organization representing businesses in the area, said many people who have been in Times Square report unpleasant interactions with costumed performers. Improving those conditions is key to tourism returning to the area as the city looks to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions, she said. </p><p>   \"If we want New York City to be a post-recovery destination, we must address these conditions before workers and visitors return to our plazas en masse,\" Ms. Fojas said. </p><p>   More than 365,000 people visited Times Square on a typical day before the pandemic, according to Times Square Alliance President Tom Harris. While tourism is still down, Mr. Harris said he has seen foot traffic rise recently. About 185,000 people walked through Times Square on April 24, a Saturday, he said. That is up from 115,000 daily visitors counted in March. </p><p>   Matthew Christian, a musician and director of BuskNY, an advocacy group that promotes the interests of musical performers in New York City subways, said costumed street performers like those working in Times Square add value to the city's public spaces. </p><p>   \"Of the thousands of dollars I made performing, I think every single dollar has come from someone who connected and really found joy in the performance,\" he said. \"I think that's very much the same thing for costumed performers.\" </p><p></p>",
