The accession of Charles III is the dominant story and in some ways the only story in UK politics at the moment. </p> <p>But the remarkable developments in the war in Ukraine are the biggest story in European politics — with direct and indirect consequences for the UK. Some thoughts on all of the above in today's note. </p>  <p><em>Inside Politics is edited by Georgina Quach.

King Charles III is <em>not </em>Queen Elizabeth II, obviously. It also reopens and reinvigorates discussions about the monarch's involvement in politics, the topic of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52d775b0-a575-460a-a8c8-678a84b0f93d\">great piece by Robert Shrimsley</a> today.</p> <p>Besides the superficial consequences — that the Queen's son looks and sounds different — the change in monarch carries huge significance internally, too: King Charles will have a different style and approach to managing the royal family. Judith Evans and George Hammond have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb86dd38-073c-4081-8e8e-9dae3a56d7b4\">written a great primer</a> on the finances and organisation of the Duchy of Cornwall, offering interesting insight into our new monarch's management style.</p> <p>As Henry Mance writes in his superb profile of the new king:</p> <blockquote>  <p>His decades as next in line meant he had to define the waiting role. “To be just a presence would be fatal,” he wrote in his diary in 1970, after talking with Richard Nixon at the White House. Restless and haunted by duty, Charles opted to champion causes that included inner-city revival, sustainable agriculture and interfaith understanding.</p> </blockquote> <p>Charles III's challenge is in stepping into a role that in the democratic era has largely been defined by one occupant, Elizabeth II. Now, the challenge for Prince William, the new Prince of Wales, is in occupying a role (that of the heir) which has <em>also </em>largely been defined by one occupant. </p> <p>The new King had to do a lot of things <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/his-majesty-king%E2%80%99s-address-nation-and-commonwealth\">with his first speech</a>. He had to pay tribute to his mother in a way that managed to both maintain the mysticism of the monarchy without making the new king sound inhuman. The speech had to do some broad-picture stuff about the type of monarch he intends to be. And it needed to address and defuse, at least partially, some of the criticisms that he has attracted during his long wait for the throne, and to create the space for his own son to take up the role of heir. Here's the key line: </p> <blockquote>  <p>Our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the centre ground where vital help can be given.</p> </blockquote> <p>Charles III is doing an awful lot in this paragraph! He's acknowledging his own role is changing — but he is also subtly reinforcing his own interpretation of the role of heir. He is making what was criticised during his time as heir to the throne as irregular, regular. He is essentially saying that an heir who has opinions — whether his own pet projects or those of his son, Prince William, who has talked about the importance of mental health and environmentalism in recent years — is actually a big part of how the UK constitution works.</p> <p>One reason why the UK's tattered and defeated band of organised republicans have long been optimistic about the reign of Charles III is that his reign disrupts the Marmite jar strategy. But on this evidence, the republican hope that Charles III will be a less savvy and adroit political operator than his mother may prove to be a forlorn one. </p> <h1>Truss: getting the big calls right?</h1> <p>The past few days have seen a series of remarkable developments and what appear to be a set of stunning victories by Ukrainian forces in the war in Ukraine. I am neither a military expert nor a Russia one and am not going to pretend to be either. As Roman Olearchyk and John Paul Rathbone explain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72afd742-8f54-4f9a-920d-bb58870981a8\">in their essential piece</a> on recent developments, much is still unclear:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The strategic effects of what this attack has already achieved — other than free vast swaths of thinly populated Ukrainian territory — are still to become clear. </p>  <p>“The development of this campaign has been better than we expected and that means the army general staff will also be changing their plans according to the successful results,” said Reznikov. </p>  <p>Mark Galeotti, a veteran Kremlin watcher and military analyst, warned: “You should never completely underestimate the Russians, even if they can seem like a Keystone Cops army. “But it [the offensive] does provide Ukraine with the military magic of momentum, which deliberately keeps the Russians guessing as to what might come next and all the different ways Russia should disperse its troops.”</p>  <p>What it has inarguably done is give Ukraine a massive morale boost — to its own troops and to its western partners — while severely denting Russian confidence.</p> </blockquote> <p>The war in Ukraine is the biggest story in European politics and in the UK. It has a couple of important consequences: the first is that it changes the mood music in the rest of Europe about the looming winter and the energy crisis facing the continent. That matters particularly here in the UK: the decisions we have taken on gas storage and insulation have left the country more vulnerable, and as Gill Plimmer reveals, the type and version of Brexit chosen by UK ministers has also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19616e10-4991-4986-a555-6e14605340f1\">increased the cost of our energy bills</a> too.</p> <p>You can see how a hard winter sets Keir Starmer up well. He can argue that the last Labour government spent more on insulation than the Conservatives, that the last Labour government approved construction of nuclear sites that were nixed by the Conservatives, and that under his leadership Labour has committed to spend more than £200bn on the green transition, which would also have increased our resilience. This all feeds into one of the big political dividing lines Starmer wants to prosecute about the Conservative failure to plan and so on. </p> <p>So it helps Liz Truss — a longstanding hawk who regards Russia and China as civilisational threats — to be able to say, “look, I've said that Vladimir Putin must and can fail in Ukraine. I've been part of a government that got in early with military support — and as hard as things look now, victory in this war is possible.” </p> <p>I'm not saying it is enough <em>alone </em>to navigate the crises facing the UK, but it certainly helps incumbent governments across Europe, and helps Truss in particular, to have what looks an awful lot like good news from Ukraine. </p> <h1>Now try this</h1> <p>I went to a wedding of two of my closest friends this weekend, which was lovely. Among other things, we danced to Fleetwood Mac's “The Chain”, which always reminds me of one of the best television shows of the past decade, FX's <em>The Americans</em> (now streaming, as almost everything seems to be, on Disney Plus). </p> <p><em>The Americans</em> tells the story of a pair of Russian secret agents, living in deep cover in cold war-era America as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings. It's a story about global politics, espionage and marriage. As Courtney Weaver <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfbdb894-681a-11e8-b6eb-4acfcfb08c11\">explains in this excellent piece</a>, part of its success is that it manages to get you to root for the Jennings despite the fact the show never spares you the grisly details of the awful work the two of them do. </p> <h1>Top stories today</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Stagnation nation </strong>| UK output was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04edffac-85c0-4ce9-8ef6-0539d537ce08\">flat in the three months to July</a>, as rising costs hit consumers and businesses, according to data from the Office for National Statistics released today. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>‘Invisible' border </strong>| The EU's Brexit chief has said he could reduce physical customs checks across the Irish Sea to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6840d753-6675-4c13-b222-ade281840fa6\">just a few lorries a day</a>, expressing hope that the new British prime minister Liz Truss was ready to do a deal over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland.</p></li> </ul><p>Source: Stephen Bush 2022 'King Charles III defuses criticism, hinting that the heir can have opinions' FT.com 12 September.
