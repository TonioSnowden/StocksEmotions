  "text": "<p>The Golden Age of Hollywood started in the 1930s—much earlier, if you include the Silent Era—and extended at least through the 1940s,, but you don't have to go back that far for great Oscar nights when the nominees for best picture would include a resplendent example of popular entertainment and one or more features that were much smaller in scale but loomed large for their artistry. In 1978 the excitement focused on \"Star Wars\" and \"Annie Hall.\" In 1998, when U.S. viewership reached a peak in excess of 55 million, two of the main attractions were \"Titanic\" and \"L.A. Confidential,\" and Billy Crystal was back on stage for the sixth time as host of the proceedings.</p><p>Now, after three years of no-host shows, a concept less welcoming than a no-host bar, we'll have three hosts but eight fewer categories of awards bestowed during the broadcast, rather than pre-taped and pasted in; maybe the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences assumes that viewers won't miss the arts that aren't part of betting pools. However wrong-headed that decision may be—one of the banished eight, production design, is fundamental to the distinction of best-picture nominees \"Dune\" and \"The Power of the Dog\"—the need for some sort of change has been as clear as the show's chronic problems: fatuous hosts, windy speeches, bloated running times, shrinking audiences, declining ratings. Another blight is equally obvious: The presenters' material, as often as not, is dismayingly bad—inexplicably so in an industry supposedly guided by the polestar of showmanship.</p><p>Download \"The WSJ Oscars Guide 2022\" today, where you can read reviews of the Best Picture nominees, fill in your Awards night ballot, learn about the Academy's inner workings and more</p><p>Other challenges lie beyond the control of the show's producers. The on-again-off-again, what-are-the-latest-rules-again pandemic keeps inflicting collateral damage on movie theaters, whose bottom lines depend not only on pictures and popcorn but on regular attendance. (It's not a good sign that AMC, the world's largest theater chain, recently bought a substantial stake in a gold-mining venture. The prospect of Oscar gold is one thing, but the value of gold gold is another.) And, breaking news, there are still too many awards shows, even after the demise, or forced recess, of the Golden Globes.</p><p>As if all of this weren't sufficiently heavy baggage for a once-a-year celebration of excellence (with plenty of time-outs for ardent self-congratulation), the Oscars are increasingly seen in the context of the motion picture medium's future, which is cloudy at best, and its current situation, which is, to put it generously, fluid.</p><p>Yes, attention is paid each January to the Academy Awards, just as the Academy website says. For decades, in fact, the payment has started in early autumn, when the awards season gets under way. And the annual obsession with who'll win what—the horse race so beloved by publicists and entertainment journalists, and so distracting or destructive for artists—can make people forget what an inconstant source of enjoyment the theatrical medium has become. Once upon a time interesting new movies arrived in neighborhood theaters every week. Now, each January, after the awards season has run its exhausting course, the movie business takes a long winter's nap and there's little worth seeing for months to come.</p><p>This dearth of worthy mainstream movies is attributable in part to the pandemic, but only in part. Exhibitors have worried for years about where they'd find enough good movies to fill their screens. Now they're terrified by a new normal in which features from Pixar, not so long ago the platinum standard of big-screen storytelling, go directly to Disney+, and \"Dune,\" a theatrical experience if ever there was one, opens simultaneously on HBO Max as well as in physical theaters. Meanwhile, the streaming revolution proceeds at full force, not just as a stream but a ceaseless torrent of bad, good and wonderful product that slakes an ever-growing thirst for in-home viewing.</p><p>Still, movie love continues to burn bright, remarkable movies continue to be made, and many, though far from all of them in a given year, get the nominations they deserve. Rather than dwell on the omissions or snubs, I'll point to one film that received four nominations in what amounts to a singular feat, considering what it is, and an expression, or so I choose to think, of Academy voters' respect for exceptional achievement at a time when it's in short supply, of their yearning to do good work themselves, and of their belief that audiences will continue to welcome new and immersive experiences.</p><p>What's the film? \"Drive My Car,\" which, no matter what you may have heard, is not this year's version of \"Ford v Ferrari.\" What is it, then? Well, it's one minute shy of three hours long; spoken and/or signed in Japanese plus eight other languages that few Americans understand; steeped in the theater arts; mysteriously poetic; and, against the longest odds in Academy Awards memory, nominated for Directing, Adapted Screenplay, International Feature and Best Picture. That's entertainment redefined.</p><p>Looking Past the Oscars</p>",
