  "text": "<p>Lego's stellar growth slowed in the second half of last year but the world's largest toymaker still posted record sales and profits as it expected its financial performance to return to more normal levels in the coming years.</p> <p>The Danish maker of plastic bricks <a href=\"https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/2021 Annual Results Release_ENG_080322-b2ec43da-b063-42f1-ac13-7e90985690d2.pdf\">posted</a> second-half revenues up 15 per cent over the same period in 2020 at DKr32.3bn ($4.7bn), while operating profit was flat at DKr9bn.</p> <p>Lego has enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2e845f1-1484-4745-8e3e-4995ee85f772\">strong Covid-19 pandemic</a> with sales in the first half of 2021 increasing by almost half and profits more than doubling, even after decent growth in 2020. </p> <p>The privately held toymaker has consistently outpaced US rivals such as Mattel and Hasbro as well as the broader toy market, which has suffered from competition from digital devices such as iPads and smartphones in the past decade.</p> <p>It overcame problems with logistics and higher raw-material costs as sales of its City line of police and fire stations, as well as Harry Potter and Star Wars sets, did well.</p> <p>Niels Christiansen, chief executive, said: “In 2021 we saw the benefits of strategic investments made over the past three years to innovate our portfolio, expand and evolve our retail experiences, and increase capacity within our global supply chain network.”</p> <p>Christiansen has presided over a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4ceabca-88a6-4a17-b75d-db7c3e39f264\">renaissance at the toymaker</a> since taking charge in 2017, just as its impressive growth dipped for the first time in more than a decade because of bureaucracy and management failings.</p> <p>Lego is one of the few brands still enthusiastically opening physical stores. It added 165 last year to make 832 in total. More than 40 per cent of stores, 340, are in China. It has opened them to gain direct access to customers, particularly after the Toys R Us bankruptcy took away one of the biggest toy retailers.</p> <p>Lego said that its overall growth in 2021, where revenues increased by 27 per cent and operating profit by 32 per cent, was “extraordinary” but that it expected “to return to more sustainable levels of growth in 2022 while continuing our ambitious programme of investments”. </p> <p>It is looking to phase out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e09abd5-68cd-4229-b95c-d7c6b7bf52f3\">materials based on fossil fuels</a>, first from its packaging and then from the actual Lego bricks, as well as investing heavily in content that bridges the gap between the digital experience and physical play.</p> <p>Lego cancelled its press conference and all interviews on Tuesday because of concerns about issuing good results during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It expects sales growth this year in the single-digits, similar to what it expected for 2021 but still ahead of the rate expected for the broader toy market.</p> <p>The Danish group recently announced that it would build its sixth global factory, and second in Asia, in Vietnam as part of a $1bn investment to make toys for consumers on the continent outside of China.</p><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 2022 'Toymaker Lego assembles record results' FT.com 8 March.
