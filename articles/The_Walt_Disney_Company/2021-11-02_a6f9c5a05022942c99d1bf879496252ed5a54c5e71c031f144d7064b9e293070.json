  "title": "Kumail Nanjiani: comic, actor — and action figure",
  "text": "<p>Kumail Nanjiani is surrounded by the luxe trappings of London's Corinthia Hotel — thick curtains, intricate flowers. Although we are in the same city, Covid protocols restrict us to Zoom. He sits at a distance in a black rollneck, framed from the waist up as if on TV. His back could not be straighter if guns were being trained on him off camera. Unseen but just as present behind the actor-comedian is the publicity machine of two corporate giants — Marvel Studios and parent company Disney. “I'd been doing great ignoring it until you brought it up,” he deadpans. </p> <p>Nanjiani — a considerable talent best known until now for his role as a coder in the US comedy series <em>Silicon Valley</em> — is here as one of the Eternals, in the $200m blockbuster directed by Chloé Zhao. His co-stars include Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. </p> <p>He begins at a pitch of red-carpet enthusiasm. “Honestly,” he says, “it's easy to talk about the movie because I'm so excited. I genuinely, genuinely love it.” He says he is a life-long fan of comic books and Marvel films. His character, Kingo, is a Bollywood leading man who is also an immortal superhero. An action figure is available. At home in Los Angeles, Nanjiani says, he has shelves already filled with models of Batman, Hellboy and more. His own tiny likeness now stands among them. “They minimised my eyebrows to be sensitive to my feelings, but I'm like ‘No! Use more black paint!'”</p> <p>Nanjiani's physicality has lately attracted attention. Cast by Zhao in 2019, the actor — of his own volition — began a bodybuilding programme that transformed his frame into the muscular stuff of superheroism. Some of that process was shared on social media. In the modern way, the response became shrill, as if commentators saw themselves addressing not Nanjiani but Dinesh, the bully-magnet nerd he played on Silicon Valley.</p> <p>For Nanjiani, the porous line between life and art has often informed his work. As a stand-up, his material dealt with daily reality as a Pakistani-American in the era of the war on terror. In 2017, he starred in acclaimed comedy <em>The Big Sick</em>, co-written with his wife Emily V. Gordon, based on their experience of Gordon developing the rare Still's disease. Last year, early in the pandemic, the couple presented a podcast, <em>Staying In with Emily &amp; Kumail</em>, a sweetly frank collection of lockdown advice. Now Nanjiani has tried to apply the same candour to the taboo of body image, giving press interviews admitting that while training for <em>Eternals</em> he became obsessed with his weight and physique, a fixation he is yet to shake off.</p> <p>He smiles a little wearily. The promotional giddiness drops away. “I wanted to discuss my physical change thoughtfully and honestly. But it's been really strange to talk about because the truth is, I actually don't know how I feel about it.”</p> <p>The early response to <em>Eternals</em> has been uncertain too. While Zhao's attempt to make an art-house Marvel film has had mixed notices, Nanjiani has been praised for his comic dexterity. He reads his reviews, he says. “I try to parse what is useful.” The particular challenge of acting in a superhero movie intrigues him. “You have to expand everything. I look at Robert Downey Jr in his Marvel movies and technically, what he does is amazing.”</p> <p>What helped, he explains again, was a lifetime watching superheroes. But other influences are in play, too. We meet Kingo in the vivid middle of a Bollywood dance number. Growing up in Karachi, Nanjiani saw as much Bollywood as Hollywood. Getting both the details and spirit right in <em>Eternals</em> mattered to him. “American audiences might see a Bollywood dance as ironic. But it's hyper sincere. That's the beauty of it.”</p> <p>That Zhao's film will actually be released in Pakistan delights him. Even <em>Silicon Valley</em> never was. He still feels connected to the country, he says. (At the <em>Eternals</em> LA premiere, he wore a traditional sherwani.) “I think about identity a lot because I'm stuck between two worlds. I'm Pakistani but I don't live in Pakistan. I live in America. But I also don't really consider myself American. Because your membership of a group is determined by the other members, and a big chunk of America will never see me as American.” The conversation has turned again. The tone of buoyant non-controversy wobbles.</p> <p>Nanjiani came to the US in 1997, aged 19. After college in Iowa — he studied computer science and philosophy — he gravitated first to comedy, then acting. In the wake of 9/11, parts that weren't terrorists were human punchlines. He turned down several jobs. “I wouldn't do roles that required a thicker accent. I'd seen a lot of comedies where the brown guy has a thick accent, and that's the joke. So very early I decided I wasn't going to do that.”</p> <p>On screen, now that he is established and successful, his choice of roles has widened. Nanjiani has recently been a romantic lead — starring in Netflix romcom <em>The Lovebirds </em>— before becoming an ancient superhero in a film whose cast is a model of diversity. But, for all the earnest efforts of the movie industry, are issues of race in the real America getting better or worse? </p> <p>He bursts into mordant laughter. “Haha! They're getting both! We're seeing more representation on screen, but the reaction against that has been powerful and vocal. I felt eyes on me in America after 9/11 but what I feel now outside major cities is worse.” He recalls a recent visit with Gordon to a small California town. “I saw the looks I was getting and thought — ‘Oh my God! It's that look. I haven't seen that look in 15 years.' And I felt scared. It wasn't dark. I was just walking through a neighbourhood with my wife. And I was physically scared. So no, I can't say it's getting better.”</p> <p>Racism, he says, partly explains his approach to social media. Building his career in the age of Twitter and Instagram, Nanjiani once avidly used both. Now, he says, he posts only to promote his work. He no longer shares much about his personal life or reads his mentions. “Because whenever I say anything, a significant percentage of people tell me to go home.” But&#xa0;the blame doesn't only lie with big tech, he says — and the problem isn't racism alone. “No corporation should have that much power. But we've all created this serpent which is wrapping itself around us. So what can you do apart from say to eight billion people, hey, please delete all social media? Because it doesn't make us happy.”</p> <p>Comedy too has become a source of friction. The latest clash has been particularly fraught, Netflix employees staging a walkout last month in protest at a special with stand-up Dave Chappelle that was seen to be transphobic. “I understand freedom of speech,” Nanjiani says. “You have the right to pick on marginalised groups. It's legal. However — it's also bad! Punching down is unethical. There should be a backlash.” He sighs. “But I wish comedy wasn't such a flashpoint.”</p> <p>Amid the first wave of Covid, the podcast he and Gordon hosted suggested an antidote. It felt like what social media was originally sold as — human, open, authentic. “But what we talked about on the podcast is, actually, we don't know how we're feeling. Stuff is not making sense. Whereas social media has become about projecting absolute confidence you have it all figured out. And really nobody has anything figured out! Isn't that the one thing we have in common?”</p> <p><em>‘Eternals' will be in cinemas from November 5</em></p><p>Source: Danny Leigh 2021 'Kumail Nanjiani: comic, actor — and action figure' FT.com 2 November.
