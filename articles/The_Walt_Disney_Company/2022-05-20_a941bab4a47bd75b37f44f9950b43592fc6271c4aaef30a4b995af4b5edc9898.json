  "title": "U.S. News:  Judge Is Replaced in Copyright Case  ----  By Joe Palazzolo",
  "text": "<p>   One of the largest criminal copyright cases in U.S. history has a new judge and potentially a new headache for the Justice Department in its effort to extradite and convict Kim Dotcom, founder of the file-sharing service Megaupload Ltd. </p><p>   Judge Liam O'Grady was replaced this week by Judge Anthony Trenga, according to a notice on the docket in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The federal court gave no explanation for the reassignment, but Mr. Dotcom offered one on Monday: On Twitter, he wrote that Judge O'Grady was removed after Mr. Dotcom and his lawyers discovered the judge had financial ties to Walt Disney Co., one of Mr. Dotcom's alleged victims. </p><p>   A federal grand jury indicted Megaupload in 2012 on charges that the site reproduced and distributed pirated movies, television shows and music, earning Mr. Dotcom and his associates $175 million in illegal profits. Mr. Dotcom, who has denied wrongdoing, has been in New Zealand fighting extradition. </p><p>   Federal law bars judges from presiding in cases in which they or their spouses have a financial interest. Judge O'Grady's annual financial disclosure forms from 2014 to 2019 listed Disney stock. </p><p>   Spokespeople for Disney and the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting Mr. Dotcom, declined to comment. Judge O'Grady didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   A Disney unit is involved in the criminal prosecution of Mr. Dotcom as an interested party, while other Disney units are suing Mr. Dotcom in federal court for alleged copyright violations. Disney and other members of the Motion Picture Association of America have said that they may have lost billions of dollars to Megaupload's alleged piracy. </p><p>   Judge O'Grady also was overseeing the civil case until the Virginia-based federal court reassigned the lawsuit to Judge Trenga in April. </p><p>   Judge O'Grady was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article last year that revealed that he had heard more than 60 cases involving companies whose stocks were listed on his financial disclosure forms. Judge O'Grady previously told the Journal that the equities listed on his forms belonged to his wife. </p><p>   He said he had mistakenly believed her brokerage account to be a mutual fund, which wouldn't have required his recusal. </p><p>   If Mr. Dotcom's lawyers are successful in raising doubts in New Zealand about the legitimacy of the U.S. case, they could derail efforts by U.S. prosecutors to bring him to Virginia to stand trial for racketeering and money laundering conspiracy, copyright infringement and wire fraud. </p><p>   \"If the [U.S.] rulings are tainted by an appearance of impropriety, it would seem to have a domino effect on the integrity of the proceedings in New Zealand,\" Mr. Dotcom's U.S.-based lawyer, Ira Rothken, said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   James V.
