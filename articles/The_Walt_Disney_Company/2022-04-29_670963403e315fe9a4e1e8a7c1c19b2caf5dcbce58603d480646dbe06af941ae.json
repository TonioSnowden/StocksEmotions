  "text": "<p>The CDC said it believes the risk to the general public is low. It said it is possible that the positive test was the result of surface contamination. Other people also involved in the same bird-destroying operation in Colorado have tested negative but are being retested out of caution, the CDC said.</p><p>Health authorities are on guard because this strain has hit tens of millions of birds, from commercial flocks to wild birds, in at least 34 states. The rapidly spreading bird flu, the worst in seven years, has killed at least 11 million egg-laying chickens among other birds and driven up U.S. egg prices.</p><p>While H5N1 infections among people are rare, they are possible when people are exposed to enough virus. Infected birds shed virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, posing a potential risk for people in close contact with them.</p><p>An expanded version of this post appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Popular stories from WSJ.com:</p><p>* U.S. Economy Shrank in First Quarter</p><p>* Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner Asks $225 Million for Massive Malibu Compound</p><p>* FDA Advances Ban on Menthol Cigarettes</p><p>Colorado man tests positive for contagious bird flu</p>",
