  "title": "Disney's Earnings Hurt by Costs at Disney+; Flagship streaming service, which hit 'peak losses,' added 12.1 million new subscribers, while parks division logs record revenue",
  "text": "<p>In the three months ended Oct. 1, the company's flagship streaming service Disney+ added 12.1 million net new accounts, beating analysts' predictions and bringing its global total to 164.2 million subscribers.</p><p>But those new subscribers came with a hefty cost. Disney's streaming business lost $1.47 billion in the fourth quarter, more than twice the year-earlier loss and 38% wider than what analysts polled by FactSet had predicted. Since Disney+ launched three years ago, Disney's streaming business has lost more than $8 billion.</p><p>On Tuesday, Disney said the company had recorded \"peak losses\" in streaming and expects those losses to start to narrow in the current quarter. Chief Executive Bob Chapek has indicated that Disney+ is entering a new phase that gives priority to income over rapid growth, but so far the company has struggled to translate subscriber additions into profits.</p><p>\"The rapid growth of Disney+ in just three years since launch is a direct result of our strategic decision to invest heavily in creating incredible content and rolling out the service internationally,\" and the company expects to pare losses in the division going forward, Mr. Chapek said. \"Disney+ will still achieve profitability in fiscal 2024, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate.\"</p><p>Disney executives' comments highlight the difficult balancing act the company is trying to strike between spending enough money on popular shows and movies to attract new subscribers, finding the right pricing point for dozens of different markets and reining in costs so streaming can break even.</p><p>Since the spring, shares of media companies that rely on streaming have tumbled across the board, as investors have grown more pessimistic about the prospects of near-term profitability for streaming. Disney's shares closed Tuesday at $99.90, down 36% since the start of the year. The company's stock fell more than 7% in after-hours trading.</p><p>\"The halcyon days of total growth and number of subscribers, those days are over,\" said Chris Legg, senior managing director at investment bank Progress Partners, which advises companies in the media and advertising technology space. \"Disney is still in the mind-set of go-and-grab more subscribers, whether it's locally or internationally. They probably have a few quarters to keep playing that game, but Wall Street is definitely getting less patient with this spend-for-subs model.\"</p><p>Mr. Chapek said Tuesday his outlook for the streaming service remains rosy, chiefly because of price increases to some Disney+ packages and a new ad-supported subscription tier for Disney+ that are both set to take effect Dec. 8.</p><p>For its fiscal fourth quarter, Disney reported earnings of $162 million, or 9 cents a share, slightly above year-ago earnings of $159 million, or 9 cents a share. Excluding certain items, the company had earnings of 30 cents a share, down from 37 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 56 cents a share, excluding items, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue rose 9% from a year ago to $20.2 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $21.27 billion, FactSet said.</p><p>Disney's income from operations for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion, down 55% from the previous quarter and on par with the year-ago quarter.</p><p>The company's theme parks division set a record for revenue with $7.42 billion for the quarter, up 36% from a year earlier. Disney said the full-year results from the theme parks division set all-time records for the company in both revenue and operating income.</p><p>Ms. McCarthy, the CFO, pointed to \"structural changes\" that she said the company had made to the parks business during the pandemic that helped the company save money on labor, better manage crowds and encourage visitors to spend more.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Disney? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Over the last year Disney has launched an online reservation system for the parks, as well as smartphone app features that allow guests to pay extra fees to skip long lines for popular rides. The company has credited the features with transforming the parks division into Disney's most profitable.</p><p>As the streaming industry matures, most companies are raising prices, including Disney. The ad-supported tier of Disney+ will compete with a similar product launched by rival Netflix Inc. this month.</p><p>\"Streaming is a critical mass business. Scale is really, really important in order to be able to thrive,\" Mr. Chapek said last month at The Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. In the future, consolidation will lead to fewer streaming services and force companies like Disney to offer more services through their streaming platforms, he added.</p><p>This month, Disney launched a test program that placed links inside the Disney+ app allowing users to buy exclusive merchandise related to Star Wars, Marvel Studios and other popular franchises the company owns.</p><p>Write to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.com</p><p>Disney's Earnings Hurt by Costs at Disney+</p>",
