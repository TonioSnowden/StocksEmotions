  "title": "EXCHANGE --- The Streaming Olympics --- NBCUniversal hopes coverage of the Tokyo Games will boost its Peacock service",
  "text": "<p>NBCUniversal, which has aired the Olympics for decades, will show this summer's Tokyo Games on its broadcast and cable networks. All 41 competitions except men's basketball -- available to paying Peacock subscribers -- will also be aired on the platform's free, ad-supported tier, which offers a slimmer library of content. NBCUniversal hopes its original programs on Peacock, like the talk show, will add further appeal to draw viewers.</p><p>Rather than serve as traditional sportscasters, Mr. Hart said in an interview that he and his co-host aim to cover the Olympics \"in ways nobody else can\" -- tapping their knowledge of certain sports and getting acquainted with others right alongside viewers.</p><p>\"We get to step outside of the conventional way of broadcasting and commenting around the Olympics,\" he added.</p><p>A year after being postponed due to the pandemic, the Tokyo Olympics kicked off Friday amid rising anxiety about Covid-19, with the Delta variant driving global infections. Organizers have vowed to proceed without spectators after Japan imposed a state of emergency through the end of the Games.</p><p>NBCUniversal aims to use the event to boost a platform that some analysts say has lagged behind competitors, particularly in its content library, as the streaming industry becomes increasingly crowded.</p><p>Like all major media companies, NBCUniversal is trying to balance its streaming push with the demands of its traditional business, wary that viewership for the former could eat into the latter and affect deals with advertisers. Rivals that are betting on streaming as the future of entertainment and sports -- from Walt Disney Co. to AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia -- are confronting similar pressures.</p><p>Putting too much high-quality content behind a Peacock paywall or making it exclusive to the service could risk annoying viewers. It would likely also create tensions with cable- and satellite-TV distributors, which pay to carry NBC and the handful of cable channels with Olympics programming, like the USA Network and the soon-to-be-defunct NBC Sports Network.</p><p>A key task for the media company will be getting Olympics viewers who turn to Peacock during the Games to stay put after the last medals are awarded. To that end, the service is set to begin airing \"Hart to Heart,\" a new celebrity-interview series hosted by Mr. Hart, on Aug. 5, three days before the Games conclude.</p><p>\"Undoubtedly people who have never used Peacock before will, because they're interested in the Olympics,\" said Wells Fargo &amp; Co. analyst Steven Cahall. \"The question is: Can they retain that viewership?\"</p><p>Comcast executives have said the one-year-old service is outperforming expectations. The company said in late April that it had 42 million sign-ups, a third of whom either pay a subscription fee or stream the app monthly.</p><p>Still, the company faces the challenge of converting its viewers into paying customers. As of May, Peacock had fewer than 10 million paying subscribers, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Peacock offers consumers three tiers: a free, ad-supported version with a limited content library; a $4.99-a-month premium tier with ads; and a $9.99 ad-free option. The company has declined to say how many of its sign-ups come from existing Comcast cable-TV and broadband customers, who receive the premium service free.</p><p>Peacock Chairman Matt Strauss said the Olympics represent \"rocket fuel . . . driving more people\" to the platform.</p><p>\"We know that when we can get somebody to sign in and use Peacock that they have a high propensity to watch other programming,\" Mr. Strauss said. \"And that has really been kind of the primary focus at this stage of our growth.\"</p><p>Industry analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson said he expects NBCUniversal to \"bombard visitors with advertising about programming on Peacock to make sure they return after the Olympics are over.\"</p><p>\"For all intents and purposes,\" he added, \"the Olympics will be nothing short of a complete relaunch for Peacock.\"</p><p>Companies like Comcast and AT&amp;T's DirecTV have seen traditional pay-TV subscribers flee for streaming platforms like Netflix Inc. Comcast said it lost 491,000 subscribers during the first quarter, while DirecTV saw 620,000 defections.</p><p>Although the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro saw a decline in traditional television viewership compared with the London Olympics in summer 2012, NBCUniversal at the time said that didn't tell the full viewership story because many fans watched online.</p><p>NBCUniversal has televised every Summer Games since 1988 and every Winter Games since 2002. It owns the U.S. media rights for the Olympics through 2032 and committed to paying around $1.1 billion for the Games in Tokyo. That commitment steps up to around $1.27 billion beginning in 2022.</p><p>The network said it expects ad sales to exceed those of the 2016 Rio Games, which brought in roughly $1.2 billion in ad revenue. Olympics ad sales have been helped, in part, by an improving economy and a robust ad market.</p><p>Some ad buyers worry that the lack of spectators and some athletes testing positive for Covid-19 could hurt ratings. If viewership falls below a certain level, advertisers that purchased ads ahead of the Games will be given additional ad time to make up for the shortfall, a regular practice. But negotiations could get more complicated if viewership declines significantly, ad buyers said.</p><p>NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell said at a recent industry conference that, depending on ratings, this could be \"our most profitable Olympics in the history of the company.\" He said that staging the Olympic Games frequently involves challenges, such as the Zika virus that plagued Brazil in 2016.</p><p>Toyota Motor Corp., a global Olympics sponsor, scrapped plans earlier this week to run ads in Japan tied to the Games. An NBCUniversal spokesperson said that the car maker, as well as other advertisers, wouldn't be adjusting marketing plans in the U.S.</p><p>Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbajabiamila, hosts of NBC's \"American Ninja Warrior\" series, will present live coverage of some Olympic events every morning on Peacock beginning at 6 a.m. ET. The hosts said they are prepared to roll with any changes that could affect guest appearances. But Mr. Gbajabiamila also acknowledged the challenging circumstances.</p><p>\"When you think about the viewing experience, especially on Peacock, I think that because there will be no fans there, it's going to be a different energy to how people are going to be consuming the Olympics,\" he said.</p><p>---</p><p>Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.</p>",
