  "text": "<p>   Before Disney's \"The Last Duel\" gets to the actual duel, a spectacularly gory combat to the death, Ridley Scott's medieval action adventure takes us through three dueling accounts of the event that precipitated it. The wife of a Norman knight, Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer), tells her husband, Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), that she has been raped by his friend and fellow courtier, Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver). Jacques denies the accusation. Who's to be believed? The production has a lot going for it -- handsome French settings, lavish costumes, two exceptional performances (not the ones you might guess), and a theme that resonates with contemporary awareness of sexual abuse. But the narrative is cluttered with court intrigue against a background of repetitive battles, and the storytelling structure is exhausting. After watching the romantic (or predatory) maneuverings from each of the conflicting male perspectives, plus that of Lady Marguerite, the effect is less \"Rashomon\" redux than another iteration of \"Groundhog Day.\" </p><p>   The literary source of the R-rated film, which is playing in theaters and seems even longer than its 152 minutes, was a historical thriller of the same name by Eric Jager. The screen adaptation, with its cumbersome tripartite scheme, was written by Nicole Holofcener, Mr. Damon and Ben Affleck. Mr. Affleck also plays Count Pierre d'Alencon, a cousin of King Charles VI who sides with Jacques in a property dispute with Jean. (In that sense too the film has a modern connection, concerned as it is with real estate.) </p><p>   The title derives from factual records of the 14th century, a period during which France was embroiled in the 100 Years' War with England. When Carrouges seeks to defend his honor by challenging Le Gris to a formal trial by combat -- his wife's honor is considered a matter of no consequence -- he is rebuffed until he takes the challenge to the king (played as epicene and borderline-delusional by Alex Lawther). Charles assents, setting in motion the last judicial duel ever authorized in France. </p><p>   The movie involves several reunions worth noting. It's the first time Mr. Damon and Mr. Affleck have worked together on a script -- in this case as Ms. Holofcener's writing partners -- since they wrote their remarkable debut screenplay for \"Good Will Hunting\" almost a quarter-century ago. And \"The Last Duel\" finds Mr. Scott directing Mr. Damon as he did in the 2015 sci-fi adventure \"The Martian.\" (Both films were shot by Dariusz Wolski, designed by Arthur Max and costumed by Janty Yates.) But the tonal difference between the two films is startling. \"The Martian\" was playful, for all its focus on an astronaut's accidental abandonment on the Red Planet. Mr. Damon was wryly funny, while Mr. Scott's touch was light and supple when it wasn't tightening the screws and amping up the circuits of suspense. \"The Last Duel\" is often ponderous, and no wonder, given its ambitious but erratic script. </p><p>   At the core of the action is a strong, intelligent woman -- not only can Marguerite read, she's a scholar -- whose status in the aristocracy is akin to that of a brood mare. (That point is driven home by a violent encounter between two of her husband's horses.) Rape is a crime in this era, but a property crime against the husband. If Marguerite's husband loses the duel, that will be taken as proof of her mendacity, and she will lose her life by court decree. </p><p>   One of the two male versions of the circumstances leading up to the event is outrageous enough to be charming, and a showcase for Mr. Driver's quick wit. (Mr. Damon's Jean is cloddish at worst, dull and earnest at best.) Jacques is educated too, and, as he portrays it, his physical union with Marguerite was preceded by a meeting of minds -- she wanted his body, wouldn't you know, because they shared a love of linguistics. But both of these lustful men wear out their welcome with the ultimate jury, meaning us. After Chapter One, the truth according to Jean, and Chapter Two, the truth according to Jacques, it's a relief to embrace, in Chapter Three, the manifest truth according to Lady Marguerite, plus a judgment on men in general that is rendered by her handmaiden. \"They're such fools,\" she says. \"Agreed,\" Marguerite responds. </p><p>   Any judgment on the production in general must be tempered by admiration -- and downright gratitude -- for a couple of sources of grace, one of them intermittent and the other sustained, quite brilliantly, against long odds. Mr. Affleck's portrait of Pierre, the aristocrat at the center of the dispute between the two former friends, is delightfully sly and inventive; the role isn't a big one, but the actor blithely steals every scene he's in. And Jodie Comer is a revelation. Her award-winning work in \"Killing Eve,\" as well as \"Free Guy,\" precedes her, of course, but this is something different, a movie-star performance of unusual depth and variety. As a woman presumed by the men around her to be a sex object or chattel, Ms. Comer gives a heavy tale a bright, buoyant soul. </p><p></p>",
