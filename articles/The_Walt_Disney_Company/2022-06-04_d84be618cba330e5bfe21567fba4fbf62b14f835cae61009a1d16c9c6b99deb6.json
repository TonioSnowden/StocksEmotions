  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Disney Faces a High Price for India Subscriber Growth  ----  By Robbie Whelan",
  "text": "<p>   Walt Disney Co. has a tricky math problem on its hands: How to justify paying top dollar to hold on to tens of millions of streaming subscribers in India when those subscribers don't provide much revenue to the company. </p><p>   The question is front and center for Disney and its shareholders as a June 12 auction for the rights to broadcast and stream Indian Premier League cricket draws near. If Disney wins, it will likely pay more than twice what the rights sold for in 2017, and the cost per subscriber is likely to far exceed the low level of revenue that Indian streaming customers produce for the company. </p><p>   If Disney is outbid, then analysts and investors expect the company's flagship streaming service, Disney+, to lose a significant portion of its India subscriber base. The loss would be a major setback to Disney as it tries to hit its target of signing up between 230 million and 260 million Disney+ accounts globally by September 2024. </p><p>   The auction has grown increasingly competitive, with Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube unit emerging as the latest likely bidder in a crowded field that already includes Disney, Amazon.com Inc., Sony Pictures Networks India and Viacom18, a joint venture between ViacomCBS and Reliance Industries Ltd., among others, according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the league's governing board that is conducting the auction. </p><p>   The minimum bid price for all IPL rights -- including television broadcasts, streaming and international rights outside India -- that will be considered by the BCCI is $4.4 billion, said Jay Shah, the board's secretary, or roughly twice the level of the reserve bid when the rights were last auctioned in 2017. </p><p>   Mr. Shah said the higher price reflects the surge in popularity of the IPL, which last year drew about 600 million viewers. \"During the pandemic, everyone was at home, and people got used to seeing IPL matches on at home, all the time,\" Mr. Shah said. </p><p>   Given the starting point of $4.4 billion and the high level of interest, the rights will likely fetch $6 billion or more, according to people involved with the auction process. The high price tag creates a quandary for Disney, which currently owns the license to air IPL. India has become an important part of Disney's direct-to-consumer business, with the country's 50.1 million subscribers representing 36% of the total global subscribers to Disney+, according to Disney's financial filings. </p><p>   Amazon declined to comment. Sony confirmed that it plans to bid. ViacomCBS and Alphabet didn't respond to requests to comment. Disney declined to comment on the bidding. </p><p>   In a February earnings call, Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said Disney+ in India is attractive for more than just cricket, in part because it includes Disney's library of animated, superhero and sci-fi films, as well as thousands of hours of local-language content. Mr. Chapek also said that winning the IPL license was \"not critical\" to Disney achieving its goal of attracting as many as 260 million Disney+ subscribers by September 2024. </p><p>   In its most recent financial report, Disney said that about half of its 7.9 million net new subscriptions in the quarter came from Indian customers, many of whom signed up just as this year's IPL cricket season began in late March. </p><p>    Michael Morris, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said that whether or not Disney will retain the cricket rights is \"at the top of the list of questions\" he has gotten from Disney investors in recent months. </p><p>   The trouble for Disney now, according to analysts and investors, is that Indian subscribers might be too costly to retain. </p><p>   Disney earned just 76 cents in average monthly revenue per user, or ARPU, from each of its 50.1 million Indian subscribers in the second quarter, according to the company's most recent quarterly earnings report. (ARPU is a crucial metric in judging the profitability of a streaming video platform.) </p><p>   In North America, by contrast, Disney+ subscribers generated $6.32 in monthly revenue per user -- more than eight times as much as those in India -- in the most recent quarter. Subscribers in other countries, excluding India, generated an average of $6.35 in ARPU. </p><p>   If Disney were to win the June auction and pay $6 billion to secure IPL cricket rights, it would be paying $119.76 for each Disney+ subscriber in the country, implying that it would take more than 13 years at the current rate of revenue generation for Disney to recoup its investment. The IPL rights being auctioned in June only apply to the next five years. \"The numbers, based on their direct-to-consumer revenue alone, make absolutely no sense,\" said Alex Morris, founder of TSOH Investment Research in Florida and a Disney shareholder. </p><p></p>",
