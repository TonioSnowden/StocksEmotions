  "text": "<p>Equities gave up earlier gains that followed President Joe Biden's decision to nominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term as head of the U.S. central bank, as widely expected.</p><p>How stock benchmarks traded</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 17.27 points, or less than 0.1%, to end at 35,619.25. It was the largest one-day point and percentage gain since Nov. 16, based on Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 15.02 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 4,682.94, after hitting an intraday all-time high at 4,743.83 in early trade.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP fell 202.68 points, or 1.3%, closing at 15,854.76 and retreating from an intraday record at 16,212.23 set early in the session. It was the largest one-day point and percentage decline since Nov. 10.</p><p>Need to know: Here's why Santa may skip Wall Street this year</p><p>What drove the markets?</p><p>Markets were mixed on Monday in thin trading ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday, with the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP turning negative as the 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y retook the 1.6% level.</p><p>The market's earlier buoyancy came after the White House announced that Biden had nominated Powell to a second four-year term. The announcement removed some uncertainty for market participants hoping to maintain continuity in the Fed's top leadership during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Powell, viewed as a moderate Republican with a career in investment banking, originally was nominated to be chairman in 2017 by Donald Trump.</p><p>Some doubts about Powell being renamed to the head of the Fed were lingering, with investors anxious about rising inflation and talk of the need for more aggressive Fed monetary policy.</p><p>See:Here's what Powell's nomination for second term as Fed chairman means for markets</p><p>Biden also nominated Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, who was seen as a possible replacement for Powell, to serve as Fed vice chairwoman.“The consensus was Chair&#xa0;Powell&#xa0;would be nominated for a second term—no surprises today,” Jeff Klingelhofer, co-head of investments at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, wrote in an email. “With elevating inflation concerns on just about everyone's mind, Brainard would have been more difficult for the market to digest as chair. Her appointment to vice chair offers Democrats a ballast to&#xa0;Powell&#xa0;and a likely regulatory win.”</p><p>U.S. markets will be closed Thursday and see an abbreviated session Friday. According to Bespoke Investment Group, Thanksgiving week has traditionally resulted in a modest gain for stocks dating back to 1945.</p><p>Read: Falling real yields are a key to the stock-market rally: What investors need to know</p><p>“Markets hate uncertainty,” Larry Kochard, chief investment officer of Makena Capital, wrote in an email to MarketWatch. “Reappointment removes one of the possible short-term risks facing the market. Continuation of Fed leadership, which has deftly managed monetary policy during a challenging economic environment, is being well-received by the markets today.”Despite all the external factors buffeting markets, they have maintained record-setting loft and consumers have been at the heart of the advance.</p><p>The National Retail Federation is predicting November and December holiday sales will rise 8.5% to 10% this year to around $850 billion, part of that comes from the higher cost of goods. “But the good news is, people still have money to spend, even though they get less goods and services in exchange of what's spent,” according to Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote.</p><p>On the data front, existing home sales for October rose by nearly 1% to a 6.34 million annual rate, ahead of economists' estimates for 6.2 million and a 6.29 million rise in September.</p><p>The data comes ahead of a massive dump of releases coming Wednesday, which will include an update to third-quarter gross domestic product, durable goods and personal income.</p><p>Elsewhere, there was some optimism for China policy easing, after the People's Bank of China reportedly cut several phrases about policy restraint in a report.</p><p>Still, rising COVID-19 cases and increased restrictions in Europe have given some investors pause. In Europe, Austria kicked off its national lockdown, which could extend to 20 days, amid weekend protests in Brussels and the Netherlands against increasing restrictions elsewhere for the unvaccinated.</p><p>Staying on the geopolitical front, Russian stocks tumbled amid U.S. and Europe concerns about a Russia troop buildup on Ukraine border.
