  "title": "CDC Says  It's Time  To Relax  Guidance  On Masks  ---  Social distancing no  longer urged in most  cases for those who  are fully vaccinated  ----  By Brianna Abbott",
  "text": "<p>   Fully vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask or physically distance during outdoor or indoor activities, large or small, federal health officials said, the broadest easing of pandemic recommendations so far. </p><p>   The fully vaccinated should continue to wear a mask while traveling by plane, bus or train, and the guidance doesn't apply to certain places like hospitals, nursing homes and prisons, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. </p><p>   The fully protected can, however, resume doing many of the things they had to give up due to the pandemic, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said. </p><p>   \"We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy,\" Dr. Walensky said. \"That moment has come for those who are fully vaccinated.\" </p><p>   The CDC considers people fully vaccinated either two weeks after receiving their second dose of an mRNA vaccine, such as the one from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or Moderna Inc., or two weeks after getting the single-shot vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson. </p><p>   The agency said it was making the revisions based on the latest science indicating that being fully vaccinated cuts the risk of getting infected and spreading the virus to others, in addition to preventing severe disease and death. </p><p>   One recent study among healthcare workers in Israel estimated that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 97% effective against symptomatic infection and 86% effective against asymptomatic infection. </p><p>   The recent clearance of the Pfizer-BioNTech inoculation for adolescents 12 to 15 years old, the greater availability of vaccines and current case counts also informed the decision, Dr. Walensky said. </p><p>   Unvaccinated people remain at risk, Dr. Walensky said, and should continue to wear masks and get vaccinated as soon as possible. </p><p>   The agency's update further relaxes guidelines for vaccinated people as Covid-19 cases in the U.S. continue to drop. It comes as the CDC faces criticism from some public-health experts as being too cautious in easing pandemic precautions. </p><p>   The new recommendations would further move the U.S. away from the lockdown measures and strict precautions that marked earlier stages of the pandemic and toward a fuller reopening. Many states have been easing requirements for mask-wearing and other measures, while people have started returning to restaurants and other public venues. </p><p>   Shortly after the CDC announcement, the White House sent an email to staff telling them that masks were no longer required for those who have been fully vaccinated, a White House official said. </p><p>   President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris came out to the White House Rose Garden without wearing masks, and neither put one on again after their remarks. Mr. Biden said the revisions marked a milestone, but cautioned there was still more work needed to finish off the pandemic. </p><p>   \"Look, we've gotten this far,\" Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said. \"Please protect yourself until you get to the finish line. Because as great as this announcement is today, we don't want to let up.\" </p><p>   Sens. Susan Collins (R., Maine) and Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) whipped off their masks and yelled \"Freedom\" after the news broke. On the Senate floor, C-Span cameras captured Ms. Ernst pointing at her bare face and now-visible grin, and Ms. Collins waving her mask triumphantly over her head. </p><p>   The relaxation of recommendations was welcomed by scientists who said the CDC could have moved more quickly updating its guidance based on data, as well as people who had grown tired of the strict recommendations. </p><p>   Yet the move could complicate public-health efforts to curb the pandemic and stay ahead of variants given that a sizable percentage of people in the U.S. aren't fully vaccinated. One challenge: encouraging people who aren't fully protected to follow the precautions. </p><p>   \"To a large degree, it goes to an honor system,\" said Vivek Cherian, a physician affiliated with the University of Maryland Medical System. </p><p>   More than 35% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, and over 46% of the population has received at least one dose. </p><p>   In Mississippi, which has 25% of its residents fully vaccinated, the lowest rate in the country, health officials were quick to warn people to continue to wear masks, despite the guidance. \"It still makes sense in my perspective in crowded indoor circumstances for everyone to wear masks,\" said Thomas Dobbs, state health officer for Mississippi. \"Mostly because you don't know who's not vaccinated. And we're still at risk. I'm personally not comfortable doing it, and I think it still makes sense for Mississippi indoors, in crowded circumstances especially.\" </p><p>   When asked about settings where it is unclear whether or not people were vaccinated, Dr. Walensky said, \"If you are fully vaccinated, you are protected. It is the people who are not fully vaccinated in those settings who might not be wearing a mask who are not protected.\" </p><p>   Some businesses may not adopt the recommendations quickly. Kroger Co., the nation's biggest supermarket chain, said it will continue to require people to wear masks and encourage social distancing. Disney, however, said it expects to quickly an increase in the number of people allowed inside its domestic parks. </p><p>   The CDC also gave some caveats. The recommendations don't apply to healthcare settings including doctor's offices; while on planes, trains and buses and in transportation hubs like airports and train stations; jails and homeless shelters. People who are immune compromised should speak to their doctors before putting away their mask, she said. </p><p>   It also said the fully vaccinated should wear masks when required by federal and local officials and by individual businesses and workplaces. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Julie Wernau, Ken Thomas, Tarini Parti and Lindsay Wise contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
