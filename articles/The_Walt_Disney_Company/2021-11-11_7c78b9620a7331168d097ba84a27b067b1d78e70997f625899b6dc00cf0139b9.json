Sparking some concerns, the Federal Reserve may have to act faster and more aggressively to rein in inflation, as investors fled to gold, the dollar and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Hardest hit was the Nasdaq Composite, which saw its worst session since Oct. 4 — as its technology and growth-geared stocks are viewed as more sensitive to higher interest rates. Investors were also dealing with a poorly received 30-year government bond auction.</p><p>Bond markets are closed for the Veterans Day holiday, but Wednesday saw the 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD30Y yields surge. Gold prices continued to push higher, after the biggest gains since mid-June on Thursday, while the dollar also rose.</p><p>One lift for sentiment appeared to come from China's property sector. “Chinese equities are up 2% today on the news that the battled real-estate developer Evergrande HK:3333 managed to pay overdue interest on three bonds worth $148 million,” said Saxo Bank's chief investment officer, Steen Jakobsen, who noted that was also aiding sentiment for U.S. equity futures.</p><p>A softer stance from officials there on the sector also helped rally those stocks, said Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, in a note to clients. “Beijing is apparently prepared to relax the rules around how much leverage property developers can take on, allowing distressed companies some breathing room,” he said.</p><p>Read:China's Evergrande once again sidesteps default, while sector rallies on signs of Beijing ease</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>Tesla Inc.TSLA shares rose more than 3% in premarket trading.
