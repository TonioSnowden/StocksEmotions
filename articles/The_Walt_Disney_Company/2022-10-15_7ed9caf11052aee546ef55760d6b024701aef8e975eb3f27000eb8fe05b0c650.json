  "text": "<p>   Early in my relationship with the man who would become The Husband, some friends suggested that we all go car-camping on the coast of Maine over Memorial Day weekend. When I eagerly invited him along, Future Husband, a Welshman who has lived exclusively in cities, looked at me for a beat too long. </p><p>   \"Will there be pubs?\" he asked. </p><p>   There would not. My heart sank. I'd been camping my entire life. The closest he'd come was staying in a hotel without room service. Still, he agreed to give this inconceivable \"no pubs\" concept a try. </p><p>   As our camping trip approached, I realized it would go sideways if he didn't have fun. This was the first time some of my friends were meeting Future Husband, whose superpowers include the ability to telegraph exactly how much fun he is having (or not) through body language, vivid facial expressions and snarkery. </p><p>   A pal with a formerly camping-averse wife offered this sage advice: Make the experience as much like being at home as possible. My camping history was mostly limited to backpacking or bikepacking, so my existing gear was minimal and light. But with car camping, if you can pack it, you can bring it. </p><p>   Clearly, there was shopping to be done. I would make Future Husband love camping or bankrupt myself trying. </p><p>   The top priority was obvious: I had to bring a pub. I purchased a bar-worthy selection of the major alcohol groups with a heavy emphasis on his favorite, bourbon. Then I packed my barware and glasses set -- including silver swizzle sticks -- into a wooden box that could double as an actual bar. All that was missing was a surly, overweight, curiously attractive Irish barkeep. </p><p>   Next, sleeping accommodations. How would I convert my ancient tent, which slept two campers if they were very, very friendly, into a comfy bedroom? To pre-empt complaints that I'd stuffed his 6'2\" body into a sausage casing, I bought an extra-wide, super-thick sleeping bag at Eastern Mountain Sports and an inflatable mattress worthy of it. I packed my at-home pillows to recreate my bed's curated pillow display, which he loved to reassemble into creative tableaus. </p><p>   For the kitchen, I bought a new Coleman propane, double-burner camp stove and then basically packed my entire kitchen, down to a French press coffee maker and a Mickey Mouse spoon rest. I created a quaint picnic basket with real silverware, cloth napkins and antique salt and pepper shakers. </p><p>   A foldable coffee table and two foldable chairs would make a living room for cocktail hour. I considered throwing in some coffee-table books about late-period Degas and \"The Pubs of Wales.\" For the bathroom, I got a solar shower, which -- once its water bladder is hung from a tree and sun-toasted -- loosely approximates a spa experience. I added quick-drying camp towels and some Dr. Bronner's peppermint castile soap. I tutored Future Husband on which parts of the human body react poorly to the tingly, cooling effect of peppermint, a warning he viewed as a challenge. </p><p>   Finally, I had to create homelike ambience. I bought two big battery-powered Coleman lanterns and a bunch of windproof candle holders. I would paint our campground with light, like the Thomas Kinkade of Kampgrounds of America. Future Husband was especially amused by his new Petzl battery-powered headlamp, and wore it around my apartment while imitating a Dalek from \"Doctor Who.\" </p><p>   It's still midwinter on the coast of Maine over Memorial Day, so I got him a heavy-duty rain coat, the de rigueur flannel L.L. Bean fleece-lined shirt, waterproof hiking boots and wool socks. He modeled the ensemble and began referring to himself as a \"woodsman.\" I sprained a jaw muscle not giggling. </p><p>   The day arrived. We set off in lovely weather, high spirits and a car so overloaded it steered like an International Harvester combine. After we'd arrived and introductions were made, it rained so hard we silently prepared to be washed out to sea. Tents were soggily pitched, and I assembled our \"bedroom\" though I no longer had enough enthusiasm to re-create the artful pillow arrangement. After a short hike, we settled in to drink heavily and start a fire. </p><p>   The most fun aspect of a young relationship is learning new things about each other. Here's what I learned that trip: Not one element of my careful curation of the perfect homelike camping experience helped Future Husband enjoy camping. All it took to make him a camping convert was the opportunity to build, start and tend an unnecessarily gigantic, possibly dangerous, campfire, something he'd never done in his city-based life. It turned out Future Husband was (and remains) a pyromaniac. </p><p>   For the remainder of that rainy trip, he rose early and scoured the woods for dry kindling. He sought out all paper-based objects to fuel the fire. (I had to talk him out of burning the car registration). We woke up to the sight of him tending the morning flames lovingly, as if they were a newborn child. The last to bed, he hunched over the embers, ensuring they were fully extinguished. Within 24 hours, even his hair smelled like barbecue. </p><p>   \"I love camping,\" Future Husband said on the final evening, before he spit a mouthful of bourbon on the fire -- his fire -- to watch the flames leap. His eyes glowed. His inner cave man was unleashed. He was deliriously happy. </p><p>   Way happier than I was, since I was now both soaking wet and broke. Still, my mission was accomplished -- no thanks to my strategic Disney spoon rest. </p><p></p>",
