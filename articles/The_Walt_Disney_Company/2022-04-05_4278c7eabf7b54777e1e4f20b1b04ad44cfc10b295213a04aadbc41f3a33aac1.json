  "text": "<p>Launched by Margaret Thatcher almost 40 years ago, Channel 4's unique structure has left advocates of its privatisation facing an unusual challenge: the private sector is largely happy for the UK broadcaster to stay in public hands. </p> <p>Big advertisers, independent production companies and even some potential buyers have either strongly opposed moves to privatise the publicly owned, commercially funded broadcaster, or have warned about the risks of a mishandled sale. </p> <p>The decision announced by Nadine Dorries, culture secretary, to press ahead with legislation this year in effect unsettles the UK's legacy television ecosystem, just as traditional broadcasters try to reinvent themselves to cope with US streaming services such as Netflix and Disney. </p> <p>“Nobody really wants to buy Channel 4,” said one executive at a media group that is considering whether to make an offer. “But nobody wants any of their rivals to own it either.”</p> <p>Lacklustre support for the idea, notably including Channel 4's board, leaves Dorries facing a bruising battle to pass necessary legislation to enable the sale, with strong opposition expected in the House of Lords and already evident in parts of the Conservative party. </p> <p>The form of the legislation would have direct implications for the sums raised, which government insiders hope will be in excess of £1bn. While Dorries said a private Channel 4 would continue to be a public service broadcaster, amendments could expand those obligations to a point where its commercial value is hobbled. </p> <p>Monday's announcement sparked a backlash from senior Conservative MPs. Damian Green, the former deputy prime minister who started his career as a Channel 4 journalist, described the decision as “very unconservative”. “The sale of Channel 4 is politicians and civil servants thinking they know more about how to run a business than the people who run it,” he said. </p> <p>Julian Knight, chair of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, speculated about whether the government's decision was in “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/julianknight15/status/1511284341569118212\">revenge</a>” for the channel's perceived “biased coverage” on issues such as Brexit. Other senior MPs voicing reservations included former cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee. </p> <p>The privatisation process will be lengthy, with a white paper followed by primary legislation. The biggest hurdle is expected to be the Lords, which strongly opposed past privatisation efforts. Since plans to privatise Channel 4 were not included in the Tories' election manifesto, it may make it harder for the Commons to trump any resistance in the Lords. </p> <p>At stake is the hybrid role of Channel 4, which has combined an advertising-funded business model with a public service remit that supports independent producers while serving younger, more diverse audiences with alternative perspectives.</p> <p>John McVay, chief executive of Pact, the trade association for production companies, described Channel 4's remit as Thatcher's gift to his trade: “She was the mother of the British independent production sector.” </p> <p>Producers fear its role, which has helped to nurture talent such as Michaela Coel, Graham Norton and the director Steve McQueen, could never be replicated in the private sector. Faye Ward, founder of Fable Pictures, maker of Bafta-nominated <em>Rocks</em>, described plans for privatisation as “diabolical”, saying no global streaming platform would commission a relatively risky British film like <em>Rocks</em>.</p> <p>Channel 4 generated £934mn in revenue last year and commands about 10 per cent of UK television viewing through a “publisher broadcaster” model, where it does not keep the underlying rights to shows such as <em>It's a Sin</em>, <em>Black Mirror</em> or <em>Gogglebox</em>. </p> <p>This approach has meant Channel 4 never built its own in-house production arm or accumulated a library of rights to shows and movies — the type of assets that are prized in a streaming age. </p> <p>One banker said it left the government in effect selling Channel 4's brand, its Richard Rogers-designed headquarters and the remodelled obligations and benefits of the broadcaster's public service remit. “What matters is the legislation,” he said.</p> <p>Advertisers fear a private Channel 4 will no longer be motivated to serve hard-to-reach, younger audiences and might corner an unhealthy share of the TV advertising market if it was sold to a domestic rival such as Sky or ITV, the two other big ad sales houses in the UK. </p> <p>ITV and Channel 4 would together account for more than 70 per cent of sales — a combined market share that Phil Smith of ISBA, the trade body for UK advertisers, warned would give it “undue dominance”.</p> <p>One former minister said that ITV's involvement in particular could create “big competition problems” for the government. “You would almost certainly have to over-rule the competition commission which is tricky to do,” they said. “It's not impossible and can be done — but there will be concerns which would not exist for other bidders.” </p> <p>Dorries sees Channel 4's public ownership as “holding back” its ability to compete with global streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Disney. As well as removing the risk of Channel 4 turning to the government for financial support, privatisation may give it the opportunity to become a globally relevant producer, backed by new investment and a more liberal remit. </p> <p>Enders Analysis, the media research group, has pointed out that international media groups already in the UK market such as Discovery or Paramount, the owner of Channel 5, could make cost savings from combining operations with Channel 4, as well as finding synergies from using their existing content libraries. </p> <p>Several buyers have told the government that with the media business changing rapidly, it is hard to predict what the calculus will be when bids for Channel 4 are due to be submitted. That is likely to be in 2023 at the earliest, by which time the UK might have a new government. </p> <p>Dorries has promised the proceeds will be invested into “left behind areas”. But that has done little to allay the concerns of producers outside London, who rely on rules requiring BBC and Channel 4 to commission across the country. </p> <p>Daniela Neumann, managing director at independent producer Spun Gold, which has a regional office in Bristol, said Channel 4 had played an important role not just in fostering creativity, but supporting small producers outside the capital. </p> <p>“In terms of levelling up, if these small production studios won't be able to survive, then isn't that the opposite of levelling up?” she asked. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Emma Jacobs in London</em></p><p>Source: Alex Barker, Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe and Patricia Nilsson in London 2022 'Channel 4 sale leaves potential buyers in a quandary' FT.com 5 April.
