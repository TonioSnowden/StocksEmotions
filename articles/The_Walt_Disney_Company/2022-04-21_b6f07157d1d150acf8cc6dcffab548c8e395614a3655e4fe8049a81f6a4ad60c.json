  "text": "<p>   The advertising industry welcomed Netflix Inc.'s decision to explore offering a lower-priced ad-supported version of its service, a move that would give marketers a chance to reach younger viewers who have abandoned traditional television. </p><p>   Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Tuesday said the company was open to rolling out an ad-supported tier in the near future. The move was a stark reversal for an executive who just two years ago said he wanted Netflix to be a \"safe respite where you can explore, get stimulated, have fun, enjoy, relax -- and have none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising.\" </p><p>   The announcement came after Netflix posted its first quarterly subscriber loss in more than a decade and said it expected to lose an additional two million subscribers in the spring quarter, sending its stock plummeting. </p><p>   \"I think there's a lot of pent-up demand from advertisers to be able to reach Netflix viewers, especially younger, more affluent households that historically have been hard to reach with television advertising,\" said Andre Swanston, a senior vice president for the media and entertainment vertical at TransUnion, a credit-ratings firm. </p><p>   In the U.S. alone, traditional pay-TV providers have lost nearly 30 million customers since 2013 -- a decline of about 30% -- as more and more consumers cut the cord, according to MoffettNathanson, a research firm. A growing number of Americans now get their entertainment solely from streaming services, which have signed up tens of millions of new subscribers in recent years. </p><p>   \"From an advertising standpoint, this is an opportunity to really reach those hard-to-find consumers,\" said Brad Stockton, a senior vice president for U.S. national video innovation at dentsu, an advertising company, of a potential ad-supported version of Netflix. </p><p>   Many streaming services are already offering lower-priced, ad-supported versions, including Walt Disney Co.-controlled Hulu, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max and Comcast Corp.'s Peacock. Disney is also planning to do so with its flagship service Disney+ by late 2022. But with nearly 222 million subscribers world-wide, Netflix has far greater reach than any of its rivals. </p><p>   Of all the digital-marketing options available to advertisers, not many allow marketers to deliver a specific message to a specific group of people within such a large audience, said Nick Drabicky, a senior vice president and general manager of client services at January Digital, a strategic consulting and digital media firm. \"So to say advertisers would be thrilled for this option is likely an understatement,\" he said in an email. </p><p>   Mr. Drabicky said Netflix would be particularly attractive to advertisers who don't want to pay for traditional TV ad campaigns or are looking to reach a more targeted subset of viewers. \"Netflix also has an extremely sophisticated recommendation algorithm, making the possibilities extremely appealing to advertisers,\" he said. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley analysts expect Netflix to generate billions of dollars in ad revenue over the long term, they wrote in a note Wednesday. They estimate that Hulu generates more than $3 billion in ad revenue, despite having just over half Netflix's customer base. Hulu didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p></p>",
