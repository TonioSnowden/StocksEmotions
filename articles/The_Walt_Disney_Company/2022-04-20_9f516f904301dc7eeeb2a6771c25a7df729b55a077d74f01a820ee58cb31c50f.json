  "text": "<p>The measure potentially delivers a blow to the company's operations in the state. The special district, created in 1967 and known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, exempts Disney from a host of regulations and certain taxes and fees related to emergency services and road maintenance. It saves Disney tens of millions of dollars a year, according to a person familiar with the company's finances who studied the issue over a decade ago.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Florida Senate Passes Bill to Eliminate Disney's Special Tax District</p>",
