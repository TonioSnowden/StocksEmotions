  "title": "Rufus Norris on flipping the Sleeping Beauty story with Hex ",
  "text": "<p>Fairy-tales have come in for a makeover in recent years. The conventional wish list — palace, prince, posh dress — doesn't quite cut it for a generation raised on girl power, and choosing a life-partner based on shoe-size or the fact that he happened to wake you up scarcely sets a good example. Meanwhile defining villains by size, looks or age is questionable at best.</p> <p>So we've had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0252049a-9766-11e0-af13-00144feab49a\"><em>Shrek</em></a> (challenging beauty norms), <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43317aca-a066-4b64-a5ee-cfd13f5e706c\"><em>Frozen</em> </a>(championing sisterhood) and, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fce78955-22c1-460a-a5c0-c9c4d93de783\">Andrew Lloyd Webber's <em>Cinderella</em></a>, in which our heroine is a rebellious goth who hangs out in the woods and the dashing prince isn't quite what he seems.<br><br>But what of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>? On the surface, it's not promising. The very title of the story pigeonholes its protagonist, plus she spends most of the story asleep and is married off as soon as she wakes. Even the villain lacks serious credentials: a fairy so profoundly peeved at being left off a guest list that she slaps a hex on a newborn. Hardly adequate motivation.</p> <p>It's not marvellous material for drama, admits Rufus Norris, director of London's National Theatre: “The princess is cursed when she's a tiny baby; she can't stop it happening; she falls asleep; she's woken up by somebody she's never met. It's the opposite of agency, which really is the root of all story.”</p> <p>Norris is about to make amends. The theatre's seasonal family show, <em>Hex</em>, is a new musical that flips the story, reaching beyond the “happy ever after” to give princess Rose a chance to make some decisions and furnishing the prince with a back-story of his own (his mother is an ogre with a taste for human flesh).</p> <p>But, most notably, <em>Hex</em> shifts the focus of the tale. Here the “wicked fairy” gets to tell her side of the story. It turns out that Fairy (played by Rosalie Craig) is not a mean old ratbag, but a lonely and loveable little comic oddball who longs to do good. Rather than setting out to do mischief, she is summoned to the palace by an exhausted king and queen who are desperate to get their daughter to sleep. What happens next depends on the subtle distinction between a blessing and a hex and is a mistake Fairy spends the next century trying to repair.</p> <p>It's a switch that foregrounds the engine of the story — that fateful curse and the reasons behind it — and delves into the deeper riches of the tale. “The psychology of doing good is very interesting,” Norris says.</p> <p>But wait a minute. Isn't half the fun of seasonal shows the chance to boo baddies and revel in their demise? Norris argues that the truth is knottier and more gripping and that characters do still “behave very badly” in <em>Hex</em>. He points out too that this version is closer to earlier, more macabre iterations of the folk tale (several of which included cannibalism and rape) than later, more sugary retellings.</p> <p>“Through the Victorianisation of them, and then Disney, [these tales] became more sentimental and saccharine. They lost the deeper humanity in them and became affected by the politics of the times. The origins of <em>Sleeping Beauty,</em> going back to the 1697 Charles Perrault version and before that the 13th-century version, are darker.”</p> <p>It's not the first time Norris has tangled with the briar hedge and the sleeping princess. He staged an acclaimed <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, complete with a farting fairy, at London's Young Vic in 2002. The flatulence has gone, he says, though “there will be plenty of bodily functions” for younger audience members to enjoy. And it's now a musical, with Jim Fortune providing the score.</p> <p>“We try to draw largely from British music,” says Norris. “There are four different choruses: the staff of the palace; the staff of the castle; the princes and the thorns. They each have a very different energy about them. So the thorns have got a very ska feel about them; the palace staff are more <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/life-of-a-song/modern-major-general.html\">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>; the music in the castle is more dirge-like and medieval.”</p> <p>For him, the National Theatre has a particular responsibility towards musicals. As an organisation in receipt of public subsidy, it can both foster new work and stage existing shows that may be too challenging or costly for commercial theatre to risk.</p> <p>“It's important that a place like this has a commitment to evolving new musicals: we've now got a pipeline of work coming through. If we're going to do [an existing musical] it should probably be one that you wouldn't get the chance to see elsewhere. So <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/395183d0-23ed-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c\"><em>Threepenny Opera</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/002b0d5c-93bc-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0\"><em>Follies</em></a> [both recently staged] are two obvious examples of that.”</p> <p><em>Hex</em> fuses that drive for new work with a recent NT tradition of high-profile shows for children. There has been criticism of the project, however. For his 2002 <em>Beauty</em>, Norris himself wrote the script. For this version he is working with a playwright, Tanya Ronder, who is also his wife, which has brought accusations of nepotism. Norris argues that Ronder has been close to the project since its earlier iteration:</p> <p>“Tanya was my primary working partner before I got this job, she had a long relationship with the National Theatre — she did three shows here, none of which were commissioned by me — before I took over and has done none since. We haven't worked together for eight or nine years . . . I hope [that] is a clear signal that I'm not somebody who thrives on nepotism.”</p> <p>For the National, as for all venues, it's been a very tough 18 months. After closing abruptly in March 2020, the theatre tried to reopen twice before finally achieving a sustained programme from June this year. By mid-December it will have all three of its spaces running simultaneously, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db0dec12-0311-4270-badf-b7d1bcf67b7d\"><em>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee06bc5a-5211-11e9-8f44-fe4a86c48b33\"><em>The Lehman Trilogy</em></a> in the West End and on Broadway, respectively. &#xa0;</p> <p>Norris admits that “there are huge unknowns” heading into the winter. But embedded in <em>Hex</em>, he adds, are comedy, hope, and a response to the anxiety and isolation that has affected many young people in recent months.</p> <p>“This show in many ways is about individuals who are lonely. The fairy has spent most of her life abandoned in a forest because she can't fly; the ogress is totally locked into herself; Rose is separated from her family. So a lot of the piece is about learning to be together. It's about saying it's worth it: in company, we're better.”</p> <p><em>December 4-January 22, </em><a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk\"><em>nationaltheatre.org.uk</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Sarah Hemming 2021 'Rufus Norris on flipping the Sleeping Beauty story with Hex ' FT.com 3 December.
