  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>The 17th-century tulip boom-and-bust was exaggerated by Calvinist propagandists, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/\">historians say</a>. Regardless, Holland's frenzied trade in bulbs makes for a colourful warning about the risks of financial bubbles.</p> <p>Tulipmania was invoked by JPMorgan Chase's chief executive Jamie Dimon when discussing bitcoin four years ago. He has stuck to his guns. This month he called the cryptocurrency “worthless”. In the intervening period, the price has risen 15-fold. This week it hit an all-time high.</p> <p>Lex thinks digital assets need to be taken seriously. Their shift into the financial mainstream inspired our series this week examining their prospects.</p> <p>Crypto enthusiasts often claim it is a market hedge. Yet the price of this supposedly uncorrelated asset roughly halved last year when the S&amp;P 500 fell by a third. Bitcoin would stay glued to the linoleum through a prolonged bear market, Lex opined. This week's launch of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffc17845-2667-4c44-b284-dc769b76b0d4\">bitcoin exchange traded fund</a> does not help matters. Returns will be eroded by relatively high costs compared with owning bitcoin directly. </p> <p>The reams of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8f899a3-885c-4bdc-a29c-e406fc78c28f\">investment research</a> being churned out is often pretty pointless. It is reasonable to value the publicly listed companies earning a living from the new industry. But valuing cryptos themselves is an exercise of dubious intellectual validity. Particularly as their utility is limited to secrecy, dissent and speculation.</p> <p>Cryptocurrencies are often dismissed as solutions in search of problems. But they pose a potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad3709c9-b01c-4b88-9cee-c1cce40e5acf\">problem for banks</a>. Central banks envisage offering deposit accounts if they introduce digital currencies to fend off the threat posed by crypto assets to official currencies. The competition would clobber returns for retail lenders.</p> <p>One of the reasons bitcoin is doing so well is the perception that, like gold, it is an inflation hedge. Shortages are rapidly pushing up the cost of goods and labour.</p> <p>Workers are flexing their muscles too. A threatened strike by behind-the-scenes workers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36cfece0-3a2f-4123-96b3-c69e7b207348\">in Hollywood</a> was averted after their union struck a last-minute compromise with a trade association that represents the likes of Disney, Warner Bros and Netflix. American labour is having a moment. As shareholders and executives line their pockets, workers are no longer willing to be left behind.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a64e520c-e104-4807-bd8d-d6338bb8f851\">gig economy</a> is one sector that is potentially vulnerable to wage inflation. Even though low earnings are a common cause of complaint, many platforms have been subsidising workers in the hope of winning a leading market position. The expectation was that those would be phased out as they gained more market power. But wage inflation at the bottom of the pay scale could force them to pay more, without necessarily being able to pass on the higher costs to customers. </p> <p>Ride-hailing app Uber announced in April that it would need to fork out $250m on incentives to fend off a driver shortage. Even so, it was recently able to tell investors that it would soon break even — though only on an adjusted ebitda basis — thanks in large part to cost cuts. A Lex in-depth article examining this claim warned that adjusted ebitda, which excludes stock-based compensation, can be<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aed64100-917f-455d-9569-2220c53204bf\"> deceptively optimistic</a>.</p> <p>Uber's market value has jumped since it raised hopes of positive adjusted ebitda in the next quarter. It is not alone. Stocks have forged ahead, leaving September's sell-off a faded memory. The S&amp;P 500 is back to all-time highs. </p> <p>Soaring equity prices flatter one — somewhat misleading — measure of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da04cf68-a965-4872-ab7c-3b67cac9a6e2\">corporate leverage</a>. Corporate America's loans and bonds are just 23 per cent of its market capitalisation, a historic low. But that should not disguise the recent explosion in debt issuance.</p> <p>The market for leveraged loans — used to finance speculative-grade companies — has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8da10faa-80e2-492d-a36c-427c494503bb\">reached new heights</a>. Private equity groups are launching buyouts and taking money out of companies they already own. The default rate is effectively zero. But a bumpy shift to a world with higher interest rates would leave many companies struggling, noted Lex.</p> <p>The buoyancy of financial markets in the face of rising inflation and slowing growth is not wholly reassuring. Those of a nervous disposition invoke the “Greater Fool” theory — supposedly a driver of tulipmania. Profits can be made by buying assets at an inflated value if they can be sold for even more.</p> <p>But this week provided some encouragement too. Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca7c2567-2c64-436d-b123-dfa7d1dfe340\">running out of time</a>. Yet fears of financial contagion are receding. A strong set of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cfbc4f8-9a3b-4080-a8f3-3a18dd5dfe69\">results from Nestlé</a> demonstrated formidable pricing power too. It is not alone. The message from recent earnings is that margins, for now, appear to be holding up.</p> <p>Enjoy the weekend,</p> <p><strong>Vanessa Houlder<br></strong><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: Vanessa Houlder 2021 'Best of Lex: propaganda, protests and profitability' FT.com 22 October.
