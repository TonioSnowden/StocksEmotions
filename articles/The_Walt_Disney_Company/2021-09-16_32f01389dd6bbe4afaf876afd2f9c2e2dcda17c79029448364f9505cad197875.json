  "title": "Lachlan Murdoch becomes serial dealmaker at helm of media empire",
  "text": "<p>Lachlan Murdoch has emerged as a serial dealmaker since taking the reins as the heir apparent of his father Rupert's entertainment empire in 2019, overseeing almost $7bn in acquisitions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Over the past decade Lachlan and his brother James jockeyed for the role of successor to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Rupert_Murdoch\">Rupert</a>, who is now 90 years old, but the question was settled after the break-up of the Murdoch empire through the $71bn sale of the bulk of 21st Century Fox to Disney in March 2019. </p> <p>Lachlan, 50, now has leading roles at the companies still controlled by the Murdoch family, becoming chief executive of Fox and continuing as co-chair of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/df728671-58cb-4474-9419-0178dc0e4b7a\">News Corp</a>, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Times and the New York Post. </p> <p>After the Disney sale, James, 48, left the family business to build his own portfolio of media assets and has since <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eab68e1-7afb-4282-95fa-3149bd091efa\">distanced himself</a> from the conservative politics of the news brands controlled by his family.</p> <p>Since Lachlan cemented his influence over the family empire, entities controlled by the Murdochs have spent almost $7bn on more than 20 acquisitions, according to Financial Times research and data from Refinitiv. James<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/6f3769f8-8a0a-4631-8204-f8a1c69576da\"> has spent roughly $700m on more than 10 deals. </a></p> <p>Lachlan appears to have taken his cue from Rupert, who was known for constant dealmaking that saw him take a small Australian newspaper owned by his father and turn it into a global media colossus spanning the US, Europe and Asia. </p> <p>After selling most of 21st Century Fox to Disney, the “new Fox” became a much slimmer company, focused more squarely on television broadcasting, news and sport. Since taking over as chief executive, Lachlan has pushed Fox into new areas such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc9ae592-7272-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5\">sports betting</a>, blockchain and streaming, through eight acquisitions worth more than $1.5bn. </p> <p>This week Fox also bought TMZ, the celebrity gossip site, for less than $50m, according to a person briefed on the deal.</p> <p>During the Lachlan era, News Corp has been aggressive too, striking $2.9bn in acquisitions since March 2019, with the purchase of Investor's Business Daily and the Oil Price Information Service.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Murdochs have also used other holding companies to clinch deals. For instance, REA Group, an Australian subsidiary of News Corp, has made five acquisitions since 2019, while Bridgetown 2 Holdings, an investment group in which the Murdochs have an 18 per cent stake, paid $1.7bn for PropertyGuru.</p> <p>In total Murdoch-backed entities, including Charlesbank Capital and others, have made $6.9bn in acquisitions since March 2019. </p> <p>James has also been acquisitive since he announced plans to use his $2bn windfall from the Disney sale to assemble his own portfolio. Through his holding company Lupa Systems, he has invested in Vice Media, the Tribeca Film Festival, a comic book publisher and start-ups aimed at combating fake news. </p> <p>Last year James <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/285512c3-52c3-4f21-bb8b-ca89c9e241da\">quit the board</a> of News Corp, citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by [the company's] news outlets”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Two people who have worked with James in the past said that Rupert's youngest son was still in the early innings of his career as an investor and was taking a calibrated and prudent approach with the bets he was making.&#xa0;</p> <p>“James is new to the game,” said a person who was involved in one of the deals completed by Lupa. “He's not [Warren] Buffett and maybe he'll never be Buffett, but he's got a clear idea of the opportunities he wants to target.”</p> <p>Another person said that comparing the two brothers' investments record was hard given that Lachlan wielded power at a very cash generative media empire, while James was putting to work part of the proceeds from the sale to Disney.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It's not an apples to apples comparison — I know everybody is obsessed with their rivalry because of <em>Succession</em>,” said a person who knows both James and Lachlan, referring to the hit TV show that is in part based on the family. </p> <p>“But the truth is that they are trying to focus on their own thing,” the person added.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan and Anna Nicolaou in New York 2021 'Lachlan Murdoch becomes serial dealmaker at helm of media empire' FT.com 16 September.
