  "text": "<p>Investors say markets have faced pressure from a variety of factors. Central bankers around the world have warned they will have to hold interest rates at higher levels for longer despite recent progress in the fight against inflation. Data on U.S. retail sales has fueled some concerns that consumers are beginning to feel the bite of high borrowing costs and inflation. A surge in Covid-19 cases in China has raised questions about its recent loosening of pandemic restrictions, too.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 34.70 points, or 0.9%, to 3817.66, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 162.92 points, or 0.5%, to 32757.54. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 159.38 points, or 1.5%, to 10546.03.</p><p>Stocks fell broadly Monday, with 10 of 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 ending the day lower.</p><p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms slipped $4.95, or 4.1%, to $114.48 after the European Union charged it with antitrust violations linked to its Marketplace service.</p><p>Walt Disney shares fell $4.30, or 4.8%, to $85.78 after the company's latest film, \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" generated less money than expected in its debut weekend.</p><p>Government bonds were also hit by selling. U.S. bond yields, which have soared this year because of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases, climbed, with the yield on 10-year Treasurys rising to 3.581% from 3.481% on Friday. Yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>The U.S. dollar resumed its slide. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, declined 0.1%. It remains on track to end the year with a gain of around 9%.</p><p>In oil, Brent crude prices rose 1% to $79.80 a barrel.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 gained 0.4%.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell more than 2% after the Bank of Japan surprised the market by raising the cap on a benchmark interest rate to 0.5% from 0.25%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down almost 1%.</p>",
