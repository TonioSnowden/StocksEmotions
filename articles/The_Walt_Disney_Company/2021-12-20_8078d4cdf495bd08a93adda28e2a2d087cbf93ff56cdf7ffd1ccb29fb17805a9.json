  "text": "<p>In the original <em>The Wonder Years</em>, the sweetly earnest comedy drama about life in 1960s suburbia which aired between 1988 and 1993, we met Fred Savage's Kevin, a dorky 12-year-old grappling with friendship, family and matters of the heart. Now the series has returned, courtesy of writer Saladin K Patterson, to focus on Dean (played by child actor Elisha Williams, with an adult voiceover by Don Cheadle) who lives with his parents, Lillian and Bill (Saycon Sengbloh and <em>The West Wing</em>'s Dulé Hill), and rebellious older sister Kim (Laura Kariuki). Photos of a man in uniform point to a big brother fighting in Vietnam.</p> <p>Where Kevin lived in a nameless suburb, Dean resides in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1968, at a time when schools are newly desegregated. But the biggest change here is that Dean and his family are African-American. While the series has the same narrative structure as its predecessor, you can be sure the first words uttered by Dean — “Growing up, Mom and Dad gave me the police talk about how to handle yourself around cops” — could never have come from Kevin's mouth.</p> <p>Television and cinema are awash with remakes, many of them with no greater ambition than to cash in on audience nostalgia. But there is power in changing the race of <em>The Wonder Years</em>' family; this is not merely about refreshing the brand. Executive-produced by Savage, the new iteration offers an alternative perspective rarely seen on television: that of the middle-class black family getting on with their lives in an era of civil and political unrest.</p> <p>While much of Dean's life experience is informed by external events, his adolescent travails wisely take dramatic precedence. This means that when news arrives of Martin Luther King's assassination, the attention stays largely on Dean who realises he can turn matters to his advantage. Observing the liberal white guilt of his teachers — one brings him to the front of the mostly white class in order to hug him — he gets a C grade on his homework upgraded to an A and later gets himself excused from PE. “Hey, I was dealing with grief in my own way,” protests adult Dean in the voiceover. The deceptions continue at home where his parents interpret his sullen demeanour as a reaction to the death of King, prompting his dad to take him fishing. In fact, he is livid because he saw his best friend Cory (Amari O'Neil) kissing the girl he has been in love with since third grade. </p> <p>In keeping with the original, the all-new <em>The</em> <em>Wonder Years</em> offers a cosy portrait of family life complete with mellow generational discord. “Stay out of grown folks' business!” yell Dean's parents at their son whenever the conversation moves to taboo topics. But there is added piquancy in showing us what was missing the first time around. As such, this coming-of-age series provides warmly comic teatime viewing while keeping the harsher realities of the world within its sights. &#xa0;</p> <p>★★★★☆</p> <p><em>On Hulu in the US now and on Disney Plus in the UK from December 22</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Fiona Sturges 2021 'Coming-of-age series The Wonder Years gets a change of race' FT.com 20 December.
