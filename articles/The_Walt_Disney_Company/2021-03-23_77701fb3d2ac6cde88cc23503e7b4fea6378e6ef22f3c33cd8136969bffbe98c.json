Underwriters will be given an optional 30 days to buy up to an additional $300 million in Class B stock and up to an additional $150 million in convertible preferred stock, ViacomCBS said.</p><p>Paramount+ replaced the company's CBS All Access service and will effectively serve as a home base for one of Hollywood's largest studios, featuring an extensive library along with new shows, live news, sports and movies from the Paramount and Miramax studios.</p><p>The media giant faces challenges as it introduces a consumer brand in a competitive and expensive streaming video market. The streaming wars led to a rush in new movie and television series productions, with billions of dollars spent by Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+.</p><p>ViacomCBS said in February that it had 30 million paying subscribers to its video-streaming services.</p>",
