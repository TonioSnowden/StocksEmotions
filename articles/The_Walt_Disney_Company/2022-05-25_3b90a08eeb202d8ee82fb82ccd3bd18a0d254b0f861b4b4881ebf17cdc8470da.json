  "text": "<p>In 1987, Nancy Cartwright showed up to an audition for&#xa0;<em>The Simpsons</em>&#xa0;expecting to read for Lisa, Bart's younger sister, but something about Bart jumped off the page at her and she asked if she could read for him instead. Usually she would give casting directors a choice, trying a few different voices for each part, but she knew Bart's voice straight away. Matt Groening, the show's creator, hired her as soon as she started talking. Since then, <em>The Simpsons&#xa0;</em>has become quite successful.</p> <p>Thanks at least in part to the influence of that show, animated comedies aimed at adults are now enormously popular, including the release of a <em>Bob's Burgers</em> movie this month. You may have heard of Eric Cartman, Peter Griffin, BoJack Horseman, Sterling Archer or Rick and Morty. But the people who voice them? Probably not.</p> <p>As well as Bart, Cartwright voices Nelson, Ralph, Todd, Maggie (except for her first word, which was Elizabeth Taylor) and many others in&#xa0;<em>The Simpsons</em>, plus characters in&#xa0;<em>Rugrats</em>, <em>Pinky and the Brain</em>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<em>Kim Possible</em>. Her talent is clear even over Zoom as she affects at least six different voices for storytelling purposes during our conversation.</p> <p>But it's still hard to ignore a public perception ranking voice actors as inferior to their on-camera counterparts, as though the job is merely reading lines in a funny voice. “Does anybody realise how brilliant these voiceover actors are?” asks voice director Ginny McSwain (<em>Richie Rich</em>, <em>The Smurfs</em>) in the 2013 documentary&#xa0;<em>I Know That Voice</em>. “Let's just call them actors, because they have to get every cryptic expression that you would do on camera, on mic.”</p> <p>“At one time I think there was a stigma,” says Cartwright. “There was some sort of viewpoint that actors wanted to supplement their incomes by being voice actors, not really giving full credit to those who had chosen to make a career out of being a voiceover actor. That lasted a long time.”</p> <p>TV voice actors have rarely broken through on the big screen. In 1983 Cartwright appeared in&#xa0;<em>Twilight Zone: The Movie</em>, in which a malevolent boy holds a family hostage using psychokinetic powers. In a moment of portentous symbolism, her character, Ethel, is trapped inside a television and eaten by a cartoon monster. Then came her turn in 1988's&#xa0;<em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, as a squeaky cartoon shoe that gets plunged into a vat of acid by Christopher Lloyd's live-action villain Judge Doom. It's oddly harrowing.</p> <p>But<em>&#xa0;The Simpsons</em>&#xa0;gradually took over, beginning life as a short segment on&#xa0;<em>The Tracey Ullman Show</em>. Cartwright and her co-stars Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Yeardley Smith (Lisa) and Julie Kavner (Marge) crammed into a sound room with carpeted walls and shared a microphone. They were paid less than the show's other performers until they threatened to strike. According to the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://uproxx.com/tv/the-simpsons-cast-salary/\">most recent figures</a>, <em>Simpsons</em>&#xa0;cast members now get $300,000 an episode.</p> <p>“In addition to the great performers that we have on<em>&#xa0;The Simpsons</em>, there are guys that are not family names,” Cartwright adds, before reeling off a list that includes her former mentor Daws Butler (Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Yogi Bear), Lorenzo Music (Garfield) and Billy West (<em>Futurama</em>).</p> <p>Probably the closest thing to a household name in voice acting is Mel Blanc, who played Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Woody Woodpecker and a thousand others. But even he suffered indignities. In the late 1930s, Blanc was given his first role in a feature film as Gideon the Cat in Walt Disney's&#xa0;<em>Pinocchio</em>. He recorded hundreds of lines, but at the last minute producers decided to make Gideon mute. Blanc was all but removed from the film, with only a hiccup of his voice left in the final edit. He went uncredited.</p> <p>Nearly a century later the plight of the voice actor is a similar story. Among the most recognisable timbres on TV today is that of H Jon Benjamin, who voices the main characters in both&#xa0;<em>Bob's Burgers&#xa0;</em>and&#xa0;<em>Archer</em>, two animated sitcoms that have run for the past decade, with more than 300 episodes between them. Yet when Benjamin appeared in the 2014 hit comedy film&#xa0;<em>22 Jump Street</em>, playing a hapless American football coach in some of its biggest scenes, his name was absent from the film's credits.</p> <p>Benjamin's voiceover success speaks for itself, but the nature of his talent is harder to place. Unlike Cartwright, he performs his most famous roles using his regular speaking voice. In his memoir&#xa0;<em>Failure is an Option</em>, he ponders what you need to become a voice actor: “I usually say the best way forward is get another job and hopefully someone will be producing an animated show nearby and they'll ask you to do a voice.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Among his more obvious skills is improvisation, key to the appeal of&#xa0;<em>Bob's Burgers</em>, in which the feckless, neckless burger vendor Bob and his wife Linda raise three precocious children on a street beset by botched burglaries and animatronic sharks. Benjamin rarely even reads the scripts. “When you do an episode you're reading it cold,” he says over Zoom. “Then you immediately start fucking around with it.”</p> <p>He uses the same voice in&#xa0;<em>Archer</em>. While Bob is a jaded fall guy, Sterling Archer is a dapper secret agent, roaming the planet in a cashmere turtleneck, vanquishing supervillains and bedding half the world's women, while his colleagues snort MSG off each other. With&#xa0;<em>The Bob's Burgers Movie</em>&#xa0;out this month, there's also talk of an&#xa0;<em>Archer&#xa0;</em>film. “I would love it,” says Benjamin. “They also talked about making a live-action movie of<em>&#xa0;Archer</em>, in which case I might not love that as much, because I don't think I'll get the part . . . It would be like casting me as James Bond. I don't think anybody would do that.”</p> <p>Voice acting has its advantages. Cartwright remembers auditioning for on-camera roles in her early twenties, mentioning “the amount of time that it took to sit around on a set, how much preparation it took, memorising the lines . . . I got a little anxiety regarding it. It wasn't quite so fun.”</p> <p>“It's the same as acting, it's just you don't have to get up at six o'clock in the morning,” says Jess Harnell (<em>Animaniacs</em>, <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>Transformers</em>) in&#xa0;<em>I Know That Voice</em>. </p> <p>There's also the relative anonymity that voice actors enjoy while their live-action counterparts are mobbed in the street. Benjamin says his voice is recognised “infrequently”, though more often while he's had a mask on during the pandemic. “People will ask, ‘Are you the guy who plays Bob?' Half the time I'll say yes.” Sometimes he lies. “If I'm busy or something. Which is very infrequently. I'm not that busy.”</p> <p>Cartwright notes that&#xa0;<em>The Simpsons&#xa0;</em>was one of the few shows that didn't halt production during the pandemic. “When Covid hit, <em>everything&#xa0;</em>came to a stop, with the exception of animation,” she grins. “Everybody wants to do animation now.”</p> <p><em>‘The Bob's Burgers Movie' is in cinemas from May 27</em></p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Sam Davies 2022 'From The Simpsons to Bob's Burgers, voice actors are the unseen stars of the screen' FT.com 25 May.
