  "text": "<p>Messrs. Howard and Grazer will remain shareholders, and Imagine's executives will continue to steer the studio's creative output, some of the people said. Merchant bank Raine Group will also continue to own shares, some of the people said.</p><p>The talks with Centricus might not result in a deal. Other suitors have also expressed interest in Imagine, some of the people said.</p><p>A flurry of deal making has swept Hollywood in recent months as companies cash in on the demand for films and TV shows for emerging streaming services. One early milestone was Candle Media's August deal to acquire Hello Sunshine, the media company founded by Reese Witherspoon, for about $900 million.</p><p>Reshaping the Media Landscape</p><p>* Tokyo Game Maker Nexon Buys Into Marvel Directors' Production Company (Jan. 5)</p><p>* Candle Media Buys Stake in Media Company Co-Founded by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith (Jan. 4)</p><p>* LeBron James's Media Company Sells Minority Stake to Group That Includes Nike, 'Fortnite' Creator Epic Games (Oct. 14, 2021)</p><p>Since then, several companies have sold outright or taken on new investors, including Westbrook Inc., the media company co-founded by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, AGBO, the media company co-founded by \"Avengers: Endgame\" directors Joe and Anthony Russo and SpringHill Co., the media company co-founded by NBA star LeBron James.</p><p>Candle Media earlier this year agreed to purchase Moonbug Entertainment, the creator of children's show \"CoComelon,\" for more than $2.75 billion.</p><p>Founded in 1985, Imagine Entertainment has produced award-winning films and TV shows that span genres including drama, comedy and documentaries. Imagine's projects have been recognized with Academy Awards, Golden Globes and dozens of Emmy Awards, according to the company's website. Imagine has also invested in Jigsaw Productions, the media company founded by filmmaker Alex Gibney, and Jax Media, the film and TV producer co-founded by Tony Hernandez and Lilly Burns.</p><p>An acquirer could continue to license Imagine's library of movies and shows to distributors to generate cash. Some of the content Imagine has produced is already licensed to distributors including Netflix Inc., Apple Inc. and the Walt Disney Co., which could affect the company's value to an acquirer. However, Imagine has co-financed more of its projects in recent years and co-owns some of its productions, including the documentary \"Lucy &amp; Desi.\"</p><p>The company generates more than $30 million in cash annually, some of it from profit participation in its movies and TV shows, people familiar with its finances said. The company's annual revenue couldn't be learned.</p><p>Recent Imagine fare includes \"Tick, Tickâ€¦ Boom!\", a film adaptation of \"Rent\" creator Jonathan Larson's autobiographical musical that was directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p><p>Founded in 2016, London-based Centricus is a relatively low-profile investment and advisory firm that is operated by former executives of Deutsche Bank. With $40 billion in assets under management, it looks at investments in sectors including consumer, media, entertainment and sports.</p><p>Last year it held talks with UEFA, European soccer's governing body, over financing worth 6 billion euro, equivalent to $6.9 billion, and in 2020 the firm made a longshot bid for TikTok, the popular video-sharing app.</p><p>Centricus also helped establish the Vision Fund, a $100 billion investment vehicle launched by SoftBank Group Corp. Centricus teamed with SoftBank in 2018 for its $25 billion bid to launch new tournaments for FIFA, soccer's international governing body, and create a streaming and entertainment platform for it.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com and Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com</p><p>Ron Howard and Brian Grazer's Imagine Entertainment in Talks to Sell Majority Stake to Investment Firm Centricus</p>",
