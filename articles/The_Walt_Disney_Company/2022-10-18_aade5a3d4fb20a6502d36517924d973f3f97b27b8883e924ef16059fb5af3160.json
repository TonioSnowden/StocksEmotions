  "title": "Netflix and Other Streaming Platforms Are Embracing Ads—but Will the Advertisers Love Them Back? Improvements are needed to make sure the same ad doesn't appear too often and to ensure the TV is on when ads are shown, experts say",
  "text": "<p>Youth-obsessed advertisers are turning to streaming to reach younger people who have gravitated to those services and to find the legions of Americans who have ditched their traditional pay-TV packages altogether in favor of streaming. Brands also find streaming attractive because it often enables them to target ads to specific audiences, similar to the way digital ads have worked.</p><p>As a result, the U.S. connected-TV ad market is expected to reach $18.9 billion this year—a fraction of the roughly $70 billion that is spent on traditional TV ads—and grow to $33.5 billion in 2025, according to estimates from Insider Intelligence.</p><p>Still, the streaming ad space has many issues, from the lack of consistent measurement of both viewership and ad performance to the fact that millions of ad dollars go to waste because ads can continue to be delivered to a television even if the screen is turned off.</p><p>Streamers and media companies have been working toward solutions, such as showing the prompt \"Are you still watching?\" when activity has decreased from the viewer. If the viewer doesn't respond, the streaming service shuts down.</p><p>We asked two top ad buyers to identify the biggest challenges facing the sector. For Kelly Metz, managing director of advanced TV at Omnicom Media Group, it was transparency, consumer experience and lack of premium ad inventory. For Adam Gerber, executive director of U.S. investment strategy for GroupM, it was measurement, wasted ad dollars, a lack of innovation and difficulty finding content.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts of their thoughts on each of those challenges:</p><p>Kelly Metz</p><p>Transparency: Accountability and transparency are probably the biggest challenges in streaming ads. There is little transparency to where the advertiser's ad will appear and, in many cases, limited reporting on where the ad actually did appear.</p><p>As an advertiser's agent, we would know where our client's ads were running on traditional TV. With the broadcast networks, we can buy ad schedules against programming that align with our brand, comply with an advertiser's safety guidelines that could include a list of shows or channels to be avoided, and provide the right environment for ads to appear.</p><p>In streaming, we have yet to achieve the equivalent of that. Most of our streaming partners haven't supplied program-level detail at scale. We are asking them to make that information available to third-party measurement and verification companies.</p><p>We aren't getting reports from many of the streaming video providers that we need to be assured that our ads are running in the right environments and confirm that the streamer is abiding by the brand's ad-placement guidelines. That is a huge miss, and it needs to change.</p><p>On some streaming platforms, you may run advertising against any of their 600,000 content titles. An ad just might appear on \"Rambo: First Blood\" and run right before or after a scene that shows a severed head.</p><p>Consumer experience: Unfortunately, viewers often see the same ad over and over again. They might even see the same ad multiple times in the same ad break. There are several reasons for the issue. One of the main reasons is that in streaming, there are any number of different sellers who have access to a streamer's ad inventory and can sell and serve ads to the viewer of a particular service. Often, those different sales channels don't talk to each other.</p><p>In traditional TV, a TV network was the only one that could sell its ad inventory with some carve-out for local affiliates and distribution partners, but the network knew what ads were being placed in which positions during a show.</p><p>Consumers are, at best, annoyed by this experience and, at worst, might have a negative response to your brand. For our advertisers, we consider too many exposures a waste of advertiser spend.</p><p>Lack of premium inventory: There has been a dearth of ad inventory in high-quality programming because so much of the streaming viewership happened on advertising-free streaming platforms. Bringing ads to a subset of Disney+ and Netflix's subscriber base is going to bring much-needed quality and scale to the ad inventory offered in streaming.</p><p>Adam Gerber</p><p>Measurement: In the old television world, we had Nielsen ratings, which told us how popular a show was and how ads performed. In streaming, not everyone is using Nielsen. Some streamers use their own ad technology to measure ad and program performance; some use independent third-party measurement services like Nielsen or Comscore; and some use other companies.</p><p>There is a lack of consistency with measurement. It's hard to compare streaming services. None of the data sets are apples to apples.</p><p>Whether you want to debate the merits of how good or not good Nielsen data is or has been in the past, it was transparent. We knew the methodology, we got the data on a regular basis and everyone was measured using the same methodology and the same set of metrics.</p><p>Wasted ad dollars: With streaming, programming is often being delivered to the TV screen through a device such as a stick or gaming console. In some cases, the device doesn't realize that the TV is turned off, and programming and ads continue to play even though the screen is off. That is a problem, because the ads are still being counted in those cases. That means advertisers could be paying for ads that aren't being seen.</p><p>Innovative ads: There should be a more useful advertising experience for both advertisers and consumers in the streaming space. Streamers should create new ways for advertisers to talk to their consumers. They need to create engaging ad opportunities, as opposed to just simple intrusive 15 and 30 second ads, which is what the TV industry has used for decades. Streamers need to rethink the ad model.</p><p>Difficulty finding content: There is a real challenge around program discovery. We have too much content. It isn't just the content that a company produced this season, or this year. It's all the content that's ever been produced. How do you find what you like? There needs to be a way for a viewer to search across all of the different streaming services that they subscribe to and make one query. They shouldn't have to go into multiple apps and search for things. It's a clunky model right now.</p><p>Ms. Vranica is a news editor for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
