  "title": "Stock Futures Rise on Hopes of Stabilizing U.S.-China Relations; Chinese stocks rallied, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng rising 4.1%",
  "text": "<p>On Monday, U.S. stocks stumbled after a Fed official indicated that investors had overreacted to last week's inflation data, which showed that pricing pressures in October eased to the slowest pace since January. The comments from Fed governor Christopher Waller interrupted a fierce rally that kicked off late last week and pushed the S&amp;P 500 to its largest two-day percentage gain since 2020.</p><p>By Tuesday, however, optimism had swept over the market again as investors weighed fresh comments from Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard, who said that it will likely be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of interest-rate increases. Monday's meeting between President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping—the first in personbetween the two leaders since Mr. Biden took office—gave stocks a further boost, with investors hopeful that the talks will begin to repair the strained relationship between the two countries.</p><p>The move higher in U.S. stock futures followed a sharp rally in Chinese stocks, which was fueled also by China's new plan to ease pressure on its property market and its relaxing of Covid-19 pandemic controls. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 4.1%. The index is now back in a bull market, measured as a rise of 20% or more from a recent low. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite gained 1.6%.</p><p>\"There is positive news streaming in from China, which is key to the global market and global economic outlook,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"I think this is what is driving [the rally in stocks], that maybe 2023 can be a better year than 2022.\"</p><p>Ms. Shah noted that several factors are working in the stock market's favor at the moment. Stocks are heading into the end of the year, a period in which they tend to perform well. Last week's inflation data has offered renewed confidence that the Fed could slow its interest-rate increases next month. And investment sentiment—typically seen as a contrarian indicator—was very negative coming into the fourth quarter.</p><p>\"I think what the market is wrestling with now is, we know what happens in [the fourth quarter], but what happens in 2023 when those concerns about a recession start to come to fruition?\" Ms. Shah said.</p><p>In the government bond market, yields fell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to 3.820%, from 3.865% Monday. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to near-term interest rate expectations, fell to 4.361%, from 4.406%. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.6%, extending a recent spell of losses.</p><p>Investors are continuing to watch for any contagion from cryptocurrency markets, which have been hammered in the last week as the fallout from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX continues. So far, ripple effects from the incident have been fairly contained. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency prices were stable, with bitcoin rising 3.1% from its 5 p.m. ET price to $16,895.17 and ether gaining 3.5% over the period.</p><p>Elsewhere in markets, oil prices declined, with Brent crude declining 0.7% to $92.51 a barrel.</p><p>In premarket trading, U.S.-traded shares of Chinese internet-technology stocks jumped, following similar moves in Asia. Alibaba's American depositary receipts jumped 11%, while those for Tencent Music Entertainment Group gained 10%.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rose 10% before the opening bell after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a stake in the chipmaker.</p><p>Walmart jumped 7%, on pace for its largest one-day gain since 2020, after the retailer reported revenue that topped analyst expectations and raised its fiscal-year guidance.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise on Hopes of Stabilizing U.S.-China Relations</p>",
