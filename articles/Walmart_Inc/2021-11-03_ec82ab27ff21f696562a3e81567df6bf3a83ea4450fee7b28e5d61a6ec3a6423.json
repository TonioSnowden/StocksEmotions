  "title": "'Finch' Review: Man's Best Friends; Tom Hanks stars as a man riding out climate apocalypse with his canine and robotic companions in Miguel Sapochnik's feature.",
  "text": "<p>Friday, Apple TV+</p><p>Sharing a kinship with \"The Martian,\" \"Moon,\" \"All Is Lost\" and \"Solaris\" (both the Tarkovsky and Soderbergh versions), \"Finch\" is a solidly entertaining feature from director Miguel Sapochnik (\"Game of Thrones\") and not quite a one-man effort by Mr. Hanks, even if he's virtually the only actual human on screen. We first see his Finch struggling through a dust-clouded terrain in a helmet and what he calls his \"UV suit,\" singing \"American Pie\"—our tip-off that the time is not so very far away—and scavenging, mostly for food. He has a robot sidekick named Dewey—a cross between R2 D2 and the spare-parts hero of \"WALL-E\"—who helps Finch rummage through what looks like a derelict Walmart. There, Finch finds a can of dog food. He's delighted. Thankfully, for us, he has a dog. But when he feeds the charming pup, named Goodyear, he also licks his fingers.</p><p>At this point in the movie—originally titled \"BIOS\" when it was scheduled for pre-pandemic, theatrical release—the assumption among other viewers will doubtless be the same as it was for this one: that \"Finch\" is going to be a climate-change parable replete with depressing moral conclusions, general chastisements and cautionary horror. Lest that dissuade anyone from watching, the cause of the disreputable state of Earth is not pollution but solar flares—a massive one has rendered the planet a seemingly flora-free orb and turned the ozone layer into \"Swiss cheese,\" as Finch describes it.</p><p>To whom does he describe it? That would be Jeff (a \"motion capture\" and vocal performance by Caleb Landry Jones), the android that Finch the engineer fashions out of junk and programs with what seems to be the accumulated knowledge of mankind. Or something like it. Among the charms of \"Finch\" is its willingness not to overexplain, trusting our patience while involving us visually. One scene has Finch doing something with an accumulation of books that's a puzzlement, until the process explains itself: The first machine in the assembly line pops the bindings, another sorts the pages, another scans the contents, the facts are extracted and they're fed into what will be Jeff—once Finch can get him up and running, and the two can agree on a name. What the data stored in Jeff tells them early on is that 15 separate weather systems are about to converge on St. Louis, creating a storm of monstrous proportions. \"I need to know how long it will last,\" a worried Finch says to Jeff, who tells him: 40 days.</p><p>The biblical echo is no doubt intentional: Finch is the Almighty as far as Jeff is concerned, and like any divinity, Eastern or Western, Finch is a highly demanding judge of his own creation. Jeff makes mistakes—call them sins—but his flaws, often enough, can be laid at the feet of his designer. Finch doesn't see it, but we do. And it's ironically funny.</p><p>So are both Mr. Jones and Mr. Hanks, who is such a ubiquitous screen presence he often can be taken for granted. But in \"Finch\" he finds something new to do, fashioning a character who's a realist, and enough of one to know that despair is pointless. It's uplifting in its way, despite the implied threats of catastrophic weather, predatory people and mortality itself. As the human-robot-canine team takes flight for San Francisco in a ramshackle RV, the mismatched onboard chemistry consists of the literal-mindedness of Jeff, the consequent consternation of Finch, and the personification, or perhaps anthropomorphization, of innocence that is Goodyear. Who is really Finch's main concern: He has programmed Jeff to obey a set of directives (which echo Isaac Asimov's famous rules for robots), including one that supersedes all others: Jeff must protect Goodyear, no matter what.</p><p>Finch has designed Jeff specifically to care for his dog after his death, which seems to haunt him through a world that's already terrifying. But not as terrifying for Finch as the thought of Goodyear being left in it alone.</p><p>'Finch' Review: Man's Best Friends</p>",
