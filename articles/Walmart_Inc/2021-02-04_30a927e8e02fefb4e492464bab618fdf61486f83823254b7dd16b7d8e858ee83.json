Drop us a line and join the conversation:&#xa0;</strong><a href=\"mailto:Due.Diligence@FT.com\"><strong>Due.Diligence@ft.com</strong></a></p> <h2>A closer look at the leveraged buyout of Asda</h2> <p>Regular DD readers are likely now familiar with the story of <strong>Mohsin</strong> and <strong>Zuber Issa</strong>. They're the billionaire brothers behind the highly-leveraged petrol stations company <strong>EG Group</strong> and, with their private equity backers <strong>TDR Capital</strong>, they're buying the UK's third-largest supermarket chain, <strong>Asda</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a reminder, last autumn was a whirlwind time, when in the space of a few weeks they managed to:&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>Announce the Asda deal, Britain's biggest leveraged buyout in more than a decade.</p></li>  <li><p>Be made Commanders of the Order of the British empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours list.</p></li>  <li><p>Get deserted by <strong>Deloitte</strong>, who resigned as EG Group's auditor because of governance concerns.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <p>You can catch up on our reporting from that chaotic time <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a978525-d0cc-4a14-ba83-63732ee14067\">here</a> — in which we shed light on how a group of dealmakers known for aggressive, debt-fuelled acquisitions could be structuring their next move.</p> <p>Fast-forward to the present and DD's Kaye Wiggins and Robert Smith have unearthed some <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/79964b33-2406-41c8-8f24-4ff5552f1669?\">new details in this just published piece</a>. In short: the brothers and TDR combined will pay just £780m in equity to take a majority stake in a supermarket group valued at £6.8bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even that sum is unlikely to be entirely their own money since they raised hundreds of millions of pounds in November via “preference shares” — considered halfway between debt and traditional equity — in an offshore holding company that owns EG Group, which could go towards their Asda stake.</p> <p>Where does the rest of the money come from? Well, there's £500m in equity from <strong>Walmart</strong>, which will keep a minority stake. But the bulk of the £6.5bn cash contribution is made up of junk debt and selling Asda's assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>That includes £3.7bn of bonds and loans, plus £750m from selling Asda's petrol stations to EG Group and £950m from a sale-and-leaseback on its warehouses.&#xa0;</p> <p>That marks a fundamental change to Asda's previously conservative approach to debt. In the year to December 2019, its accounts showed no external debt and almost £3.5bn of freehold property assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>“That's the point of a leveraged buyout,” we hear (some of) you cry. “It's literally in the name.” And of course, the private equity industry is no stranger to debt-fuelled deals and selling off assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>But even so, this deal stands out.&#xa0;</p> <p>In Europe last year, the average leveraged buyout used equity for more than half of the deal's enterprise value, according to data from<strong> S&amp;P Global</strong>. When you combine Walmart's stake, that of the brothers, and TDR's equity, it's still nowhere near that level.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Siemens: a conglomerate praising activists?</h2> <p>Whether or not activists such as <strong>Paul Singer</strong>'s <strong>Elliott Management</strong> or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fdd0a6c-92ed-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0\"><strong>Cevian Capital</strong></a> — infamous in Germany for their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60ace06a-d88e-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">interventions</a> at <strong>Thyssenkrupp</strong> — ever held a position in <strong>Siemens</strong> remains a mystery.&#xa0;</p> <p>The investors certainly never crossed the 5 per cent threshold for reporting a stake, but their fingerprints can be seen all over the Munich-based group's new, slimmed-down, structure.</p> <p>When <strong>Joe Kaeser</strong>, a Siemens lifer who had spent time at the industrial group's Californian business watching more agile American companies forge ahead, took over as chief in 2013, he tore a leaf out of the activists' playbook.</p> <p>Siemens' lacklustre margins, he argued, were down to “improper resource allocation” in the sprawling conglomerate, which had to be broken up if it was to compete in the digital age.</p> <p>Battles with unions, which felt the restructuring was going too fast, and shareholders, who were getting impatient, threatened his position over the past few years. But the Bavarian left office on Wednesday with a sense of vindication.</p> <p><strong>Siemens Healthineers</strong>, his first big spin-off, is now worth more than <strong>BMW</strong>. And <strong>Siemens Energy</strong>, which floated last year, is becoming less of a drag on its former parent's share price, which is trading at an all-time high.</p> <p>It's a far happier story to the one unfolding in Essen, where Thyssenkrupp chief executive <strong>Martina Merz </strong>is still attempting to “stop the bleeding” after years of mismanagement forced a painful break-up.</p> <p>But where many in Germany see only damage done by greedy “locusts”, Kaeser says he sees an important counterbalance.</p> <p>“Many people, especially in Germany, say ‘Oh my God, there are those activists, they are bad people',” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b87a3c01-8036-4b8a-99d7-f5eca243222a\">he told the FT's Joe Miller</a>, “and I always say, well they are just people who believe they can do better than management . . . and I think they are well-advised to listen to them.”</p> <p>Kaeser said he was still considering whether to leave a note for his chosen successor,<strong> Roland Busch</strong>. But “should things go wrong because management gets slower or have second thoughts about the journey”, he said, “then there will be investors, you know, telling them how to continue”.</p> <p>The shareholders who once called for his ouster, he said, were “an insurance” for his legacy.</p> <p>The veteran industrialist's pro-shareholder stance makes sense as he prepares to lead the supervisory board at<strong> Siemens Energy</strong> and continues his tenure as a shareholder representative at<strong> Daimler</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>And those might not be the only boards he's looking to join post-retirement, DD is told.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Ant Group hammers out its fate</h2> <p>For <strong>Jack Ma</strong>, the charismatic billionaire founder of <strong>Alibaba </strong>who bid farewell as its chairman with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thhPxYwRgTw\">rockstar performance</a>, his fintech company <strong>Ant Group</strong>'s public market debut may be less flashy than he'd hoped.</p> <p>The payments group has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25e311e0-a489-4a2e-9533-76c8f2ba60ab\">reached a deal</a> with Chinese regulators to restructure its business before it goes ahead with any listing. This comes after Ant's would-be $37bn IPO was derailed late last year.</p> <p>The latest deal comes after Ma <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3e0ab4a-6362-4b58-99b3-23185b9a1cd4\">first re-emerged</a> from a three-month absence that left investors on edge and the People's Bank of China introduced new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a7438c5-9fe4-4b8e-94c5-6cf454c38cb4\">anti-monopoly rules</a> that turned Ant's business model on its head.</p> <p>The proposed restructuring will require Ant to put all its big businesses inside a financial holding company, meaning it will face stricter capital requirements more characteristic of a bank than a tech company.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bottom line: it will take a while before Ant can take a second shot at an IPO and it might take even longer before it reaches its record valuation, which has dropped from anywhere between 10 and 50 per cent under the new rules.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>has appointed<strong> Mark Garcia</strong> as a managing director of technology investment banking to further drive its technology banking franchise. He was previously a managing director at<strong> Citigroup</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Former <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Facebook </strong>product executive <strong>Sriram Krishnan</strong> has joined <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> as a general partner.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>StepStone Group </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.stepstoneglobal.com/news-press/stepstone-group-announces-new-partners-managing-directors/\">promoted</a> 10 partners and 10 managing directors.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>David Morley</strong> has joined <strong>CDPQ </strong>as a managing director and head of Europe.
