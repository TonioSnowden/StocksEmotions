  "text": "<p>Stocks have mounted a furious climb in recent weeks as investors reassessed their belief that persistently high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming economic slowdown were making corporate shares a bad bet. Through Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 had jumped 17% from its June low as investors reshuffled portfolios and scrambled to cover bearish wagers.</p><p>A series of strong earnings reports, as well as data last week showing U.S. inflation eased in July, have spurred much of the recent optimism. Lowe's shares climbed 1.2% Wednesday after it reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations, following strong results Tuesday from Walmart and Home Depot.</p><p>Still, investors are wrestling anxiously with whether the recent rally marks a lasting turnaround to stocks' dismal first half of the year or whether it is destined to fade.</p><p>With inflation still a critical concern, the Fed is expected to keep raising rates, but investors are wondering how quickly and for how long. Traders have been caught between, on one side, comments from Fed officials who project raising rates through next year, and, on the other, market-based forecasts that expect the central bank to slow or reverse its rate hikes.</p><p>Government bond yields, highly sensitive to interest-rate expectations, have been rising in recent sessions, a sign that more traders have been heeding central bankers' policy-tightening projections. Chris Verrone, a partner at research firm Strategas, said that higher yields are a reason to doubt the stock-market rally's endurance.</p><p>\"The bond market is not sold on this idea that some Fed pivot is imminent,\" Mr. Verrone said. \"This idea of a Fed pivotâ€”the data doesn't support it, and the bond market doesn't support it.\"</p><p>Treasury yields continued to rise on Wednesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.888%, up about 0.3 percentage points since the beginning of August. The yield on the 2-year note remained higher still, climbing to 3.354%, up nearly half a percentage point from a recent low the last week of July. That sustained a pattern known as an inverted yield curve, a bond-market signal considered a key recession predictor. Yields rise when bond prices decline.</p><p>In recent days, fed-funds futures, used by traders to place bets on how the Fed will set rates, have implied close to even odds that September will bring another 0.75-percentage-point Fed rate hike, as opposed to a smaller half-percentage-point move. Minutes from the Fed's recent meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, could offer more details about U.S. central bankers' plans.</p><p>\"We're all waiting for the Fed minutes,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. \"Like everyone, I'm scratching my head about whether we are experiencing the comeback of a bull market, or if it is just a bear-market rally.\"</p><p>Higher interest rates reduce the value that many investors' models assign to stock prices, so more hawkish signals from the Fed's minutes could pause the stock market's recent rally. And many money managers are still worried that the economy could continue to slow. On Wednesday, retail sales data showed spending at stores, online and in restaurants was flat in July. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected retail spending to climb 0.1%.</p><p>Earnings from Target on Wednesday also presented a cloudy picture of the American consumer. Target's profit fell sharply, and the company said it saw customers cut spending on discretionary items. Still, revenue rose, boosted by strong sales of food and beverage, beauty and household items and more shopper visits. Shares fell 3%.</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond jumped 27% as individual investors continued to pile into the stock, hoping to push shares even higher andpunish professionals who have bet against it.</p><p>In commodities, oil prices moved between gains and losses as fears of a global economic slowdown continue to hang over investors. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 0.7% to $93.02 a barrel, on track to break several straight days of declines.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 lost 1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.4%. The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that consumer prices were 10.1% higher in July than the year before, up from 9.4% in June. Investors sold U.K. government bonds, reflecting expectations that the Bank of England will need to further raise interest rates to tame inflation.</p><p>In Asia, stocks moved higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.2%.</p><p>Stocks Slip Ahead of Fed Minutes</p>",
