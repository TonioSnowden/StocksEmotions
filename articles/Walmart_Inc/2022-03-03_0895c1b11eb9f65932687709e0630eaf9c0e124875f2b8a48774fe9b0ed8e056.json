  "title": "Best Buy Posts Lower Sales on Supply-Chain Hit, Omicron Impact; The company said U.S. sales fell in gaming, mobile phones, tablets and services, but comparable sales grew 10.4%; shares rose 9%",
  "text": "<p>Executives said the company had expected inventory constraints to affect appliances, gaming and mobile phones, but the shortages were worse than anticipated—particularly in categories that include popular holiday gifts like mobile phones and computing.</p><p>\"We would have been healthily in our range had we not had some of those very targeted inventory constraints that were just a bit larger than we thought,\" Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said Thursday on a call with analysts. \"I think we expect to see some of those [constraints] to continue into especially the first half of next year.\"</p><p>The company said U.S. sales fell 2.6%, as sales in gaming, mobile phones, tablets and services all fell, offsetting gains in appliances, virtual reality, home theater and headphones.</p><p>The company previously warned that sales in the holiday period may take a hit as customers looked to shop early for the December holidays amid warnings of the snarled global supply chain. As a result, some holiday sales were likely pulled forward into October, taking away from the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas warned in November.</p><p>Best Buy joins a growing chorus of retailers, including Kohl's Corp., that have said inventory and labor constraints damped sales growth in recent months, even as large retailers like Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. were able to take advantage of their size to muscle through supply-chain snarls and post strong sales growth.</p><p>Best Buy's U.S. online sales fell 11.2% compared with a year earlier, the company said.</p><p>Best Buy reported full-year revenue of $51.8 billion compared with $47.3 billion in fiscal 2021, while comparable sales grew 10.4% from the previous year. The stock rose 9.1% during Thursday trading to $110.14 a share.</p><p>The company has seen e-commerce sales decline this year after a pandemic-driven boom in 2020, when temporary store closures pushed many customers to shop online. The trend has helped Best Buy reduce costs by eliminating some home-delivery expenses amid surging transportation and labor costs.</p><p>Overall, consumer demand has been strong as Americans continue to spend despite rising prices and global supply-chain snarls. Consumers spent nearly $650 billion in U.S. retail stores and restaurants in January, compared with about $504 billion in January 2019, according to government data.</p><p>Best Buy also said it expects sales to fall in fiscal 2023, the retailer's current year.</p><p>It forecast sales of between $49.3 billion and $50.8 billion, compared with $51.76 billion in fiscal 2022. Best Buy said it expects same-store sales to fall between 1% and 4% in the year ahead.</p><p>The company said it expects adjusted earnings of between $8.85 a share and $9.15 a share in the year ahead, below the $10.01 a share the company posted in fiscal 2022.</p><p>\"We do expect higher levels of promotional activity to pressure our gross profit rate\" in the coming year, Mr. Bilunas told analysts on Thursday's call.</p><p>Best Buy's Totaltech membership plan—which includes free two-day shipping, tech support, product installation and protection for $199 per year—is expected to be a drag on profits, as it cannibalizes some of the retailer's standalone services, he said.</p><p>Best Buy touted its healthcare initiatives, which it said are evolving to take advantage of the increased consumerization of healthcare that happened during the pandemic. Last year, the company acquired Current Health, a telehealth platform, and expanded its Lively brand of smart devices for older adults with partnerships with Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.</p><p>Best Buy said it expects to close between 20 and 30 stores this year. The company didn't issue guidance for the current quarter.</p><p>The company also said it is raising its quarterly dividend by 26% to 88 cents a share. Best Buy said it plans to spend about $1.5 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2023, which is the company's current year.</p><p>The company posted net income of $626 million for the quarter, compared with $816 million a year earlier. Earnings were $2.62 a share, compared with $3.10 a share in the year-ago period.</p><p>Adjusted earnings were $2.73 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $2.72 a share.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com and Charity L.
