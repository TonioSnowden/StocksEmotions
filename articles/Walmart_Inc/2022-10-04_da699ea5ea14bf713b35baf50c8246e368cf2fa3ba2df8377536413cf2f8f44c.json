  "title": "U.S. Job Openings Fell in August, Layoffs Up Slightly; Openings fell by 10% in sign that the labor market is starting to cool",
  "text": "<p>Openings dropped the most in healthcare, retail and other services industries. The decline in openings coincided with an August easing of job growth. Employers added 315,000 jobs that month, compared with 526,000 jobs in July. The figures reflect a labor market that is still strong overall, but lost some steam in August after recovering rapidly from the effects of the pandemic.</p><p>\"The labor market is cooling a bit from the extremes we saw coming out of the pandemic,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at broker dealer Amherst Pierpont.</p><p>The 10.1 million job openings in August far exceeded the 6 million unemployed people looking for work. The openings also remained well above their prepandemic level in 2019, when they averaged 7.2 million.</p><p>The high number of job openings and the low unemployment rate—at 3.7% in August—means that it remained relatively easy for people to find work.</p><p>\"Even if the labor market is cooling, it doesn't mean it's cold,\" Mr. Stanley said.</p><p>On Friday, the Labor Department is to release the number of jobs added or lost in September and the unemployment rate for that month.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials are aggressively raising interest rates to reduce high inflation by slowing economic growth, including wage and job gains.</p><p>Fed governor Philip Jefferson said Tuesday, after the job openings report was released, that the labor market remains tight, which could keep fueling inflation pressures.</p><p>\"In a market with more job openings than workers, the competition to fill vacancies is leading to rapid wage gains now, and the resulting salary compression may lead to further upward wage pressures in the future,\" he said in a speech in Atlanta.</p><p>San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, in a separate appearance in New York Tuesday, said the decline in job postings could give officials room to fight inflation.</p><p>Ms. Daly said she has heard from employers that they are posting fewer openings and hiring fewer people, which over time could take some pressure off the labor market.</p><p>\"There's a lot of room for us to slow the pace of hiring and still not dive into the third and most painful place that everybody fears, which is outright layoffs,\" she said.</p><p>Tuesday's Labor Department report added to other recent signs the overall economy is losing momentum. The U.S. economy contracted in the first half of the year and home sales fell for the seventh straight month in August as borrowing costs rose.</p><p>Business activity in U.S. manufacturing grew in September at its slowest pace in more than two years, according to the Institute for Supply Management. It said on Monday its U.S. manufacturing index fell to 50.9 in September from 52.8 in August, the lowest level since May 2020. Readings above 50 signal expansion in activity, below 50 contraction.</p><p>This year several companies, including Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc., Corteva Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., have started to lay off employees or leave jobs unfilled to reduce their costs in an uncertain economy. Walmart Inc. said it would hire about 40,000 mostly seasonal workers to serve holiday shoppers, down from the 150,000 permanent employees it was looking for a year ago. Yet nationally, the number of layoffs recently remains below prepandemic levels.</p><p>Executives say that cutting open positions and not posting new ones is easier than laying off current employees. Economists said that the labor shortages over the past year could leave companies more hesitant to lay off workers if the economy falls into a mild recession.</p><p>The total number of people who left their positions voluntarily, called quits, remained elevated at a seasonally adjusted 4.2 million in August, which suggests that workers are confident enough to leave their current postings.</p><p>Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at the jobs website Glassdoor, said the labor market has been surprisingly resilient this year.</p><p>\"It's still going hot,\" he said. \"It's an extended summer, but everyone is waiting for winter to come.\"</p><p>Alan Handley, chief executive of waste- and recycling-collection company LRS, said it has become a little easier to find and retain garbage-truck drivers in recent months. Mr. Handley said his company is offering higher wages. Workers are also more concerned about the economy and so want to keep the jobs they have, he said. LRS has raised pay over the past year to about $25 an hour from roughly $19 an hour previously.</p><p>The company, which employs about 800 drivers and 400 recycling sorters in Illinois, Minnesota and other states, has been upgrading to trucks that can be operated by a single worker instead of older models that need a driver in the front and a second employee in the back.</p><p>Mr. Handley recently spoke to managers in Wisconsin as part of his monthly trips to recycling sorting sites and saw signs that their previous hiring challenges were easing.</p><p>\"Labor didn't come up in conversation as much,\" he said, referring to the Wisconsin managers. \"Between the sign-on bonuses, retention bonus, increasing pay, it's quieter today than it was three months ago.\"</p><p>Tuesday's report detailed how many open jobs were available at the end of August, as well as how many people left their positions through quits and layoffs.</p><p>Regionally, the Midwest posted the sharpest drop in job openings, which fell 24% in August from the month before. The three other regions posted declines of around 6%.</p><p>Nick Timiraos and Danny Dougherty contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Job Openings Fell in August, Layoffs Up Slightly</p>",
