  "title": "Business News: Michaels Agrees To Go Private in Deal With Apollo",
  "text": "<p>This would be the second time the retailer is run by a private-equity owner. Michaels was taken private in 2006 by Bain Capital and Blackstone Group LP in a deal valued at more than $6 billion. It went public again in 2014.</p><p>Michaels Chairman James Quella said Wednesday that the company's board \"firmly believes Apollo's offer represents a compelling value to our shareholders.\"</p><p>Apollo, which has more than $450 billion in assets, is offering to buy Michaels shares for $22 apiece. The companies said the offer is a 47% premium to where shares closed Feb. 26, the day before speculation about a deal surfaced. Shares Wednesday rose 22% to $22.02.</p><p>Apollo and Michaels said the deal agreement allows for a 25-day go-shop period where Michaels can look at other options, but there is no assurance that process will lead to a better offer.</p><p>Former Walmart Inc. executive Ashley Buchanan became CEO of Michaels in April 2020. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Buchanan described the company's old approach as being more focused on seasonal home decor. \"We've transitioned to being arts-and-crafts driven,\" he said in the interview.</p><p>Crafts sales have been strong during the pandemic as consumers have sheltered in place. In the retailer's fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, net sales climbed around 15% and comparable-store sales -- a key metric for growth in the retail business -- rose about 16%.</p><p>Before the health crisis, Michaels was grappling with drooping sales. It reported $5.07 billion in net sales for its fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2020, down from the prior year, which also recorded a decline. Results for its just-ended fiscal year are due out Thursday.</p>",
