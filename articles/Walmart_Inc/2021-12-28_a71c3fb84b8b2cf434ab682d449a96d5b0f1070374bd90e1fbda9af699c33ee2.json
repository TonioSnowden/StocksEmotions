  "text": "<p>\n  After a decade of slapping fitness trackers onto our wrists, the health sensors are starting to break free. The screenless Oura ring is packed with mini sensors for heart rate, blood oxygen and skin temperature. Whoop sells clothing, including bras and leggings, where its tracker can be strategically placed. The camera-less Google Nest Hub display uses radar to track sleepers. And mattresses from Sleep Number, Eight Sleep and others log sleep patterns too. </p><p>\n  \"It's less about a new particular technology or sensor,\" said Chris Becherer, chief product officer at Oura. Hardware makers are looking at more ways to simplify tracking, he added. </p><p>\n  The next big health device might be your earbuds. Apple is studying the potential of AirPods to read body temperature and monitor posture, according to a Wall Street Journal report. People familiar with the plans told our colleague that the buds would take a wearer's core temperature from inside the ear and lean on motion sensors to detect slouching. Apple is also working on iPhone features to help detect depression, the Journal reported. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The speed we need </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  So long, 3G. Thanks for providing connectivity to older Kindles and Grandma's flip phone. Next year, U.S. carriers are sunsetting their aging third-generation cellular networks to make more room for the superfast fifth generation, 5G. Yes, this means those 3G devices will soon be defunct. (End dates are February for AT&amp;T, July for T-Mobile and December for Verizon.) </p><p>\n  The telecoms have plans to expand their networks in the coming year. T-Mobile said it would reach 50 million more Americans by year-end. And 5G isn't just for phones. Carriers are using the network to provide home internet service where traditional landline providers have not. In September, T-Mobile expanded to cities in Florida and North Carolina, while Verizon added Fremont, Calif., and Niagara Falls, N.Y., to its 5G home coverage. </p><p>\n  There's a good chance our internet connections will get faster at home and on the move, though there are speed bumps. President Biden's infrastructure bill, which includes $65 billion in funding for expanded broadband access in rural communities, passed in November, but the program includes a long application process for states. Plus, AT&amp;T and Verizon recently hit a 5G rollout roadblock because of concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration about potential interference with cockpit-safety systems. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Deliveries ex machina </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Depending on where you live, there's a chance a drone will drop you a delivery for the first time this year. </p><p>\n  Flytrex, an Israeli startup operating three delivery stations in North Carolina, just received FAA approval to make deliveries in a roughly one-mile radius. The company said this will allow it to carry goods from a variety of retailers, including Walmart, to more than 10,000 households. </p><p>\n  Wing Aviation, owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., is  testing and expects to launch the first commercial drone-delivery service in a dense urban area -- Dallas-Fort Worth -- in 2022, the company said in October. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, in the coming year, Cardinal Health will be using very different sorts of drones, small fixed-wing electric airplanes made by Zipline, to resupply pharmacies within 10 miles of one of its distribution centers in Kannapolis, N.C. Zipline said it is also doing home deliveries for Walmart in its hometown of Bentonville, Ark. </p><p>\n  All of these drones will continue, per FAA regulations, to be piloted by humans. </p><p>\n  With the FAA granting more permits and drones from Amazon, United Parcel Service and more than a dozen other companies all in some stage of readiness as well, it's likely that others will follow suit in 2022. </p><p></p>",
