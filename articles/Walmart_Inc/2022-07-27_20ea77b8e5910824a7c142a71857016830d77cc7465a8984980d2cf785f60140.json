  "text": "<p>\"We're now anticipating more pressure on general merchandise in the back half; however, we're encouraged by the start we're seeing on school supplies in Walmart U.S.,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Walmart WMT announced said late Monday that adjusted earnings per share are now expected to fall \"around\" 8% to 9% for the second quarter, and decline 11% to 13% for the year. The FactSet consensus is for second-quarter EPS of $1.65, implying a 7.5% drop. For the full year, the FactSet consensus is for EPS of $5.81, suggesting a 10.1% decrease.</p><p>Walmart will report second-quarter results on August 16.</p><p>See: Analysts on Walmart's profit warning: Consumers are buckling under inflation pressure and draining their COVID reserves</p><p>The news is having a broader impact on the U.S. stock market. Walmart stock fell 7.6% on Tuesday. Shares are down 12.5% for the year to date while the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has tumbled 11.4%.</p><p>McMillon highlighted this spending shift in the first-quarter earnings call in May.</p><p>\"As it relates to Walmart US general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM [general merchandise] than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food,\" he said, according to FactSet.</p><p>The 32% increase in inventory was \"higher than what [the company] wanted\" at the time, he added.</p><p>McMillon also acknowledged the pressure that some customers were already under.</p><p>\"A loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, a can of tuna, mac &amp; cheese, protein categories [â€¦] are we helping a family that's at the lower-end of the income scale to afford to feed their families during this inflationary time?\" he asked.</p><p>\"And given that stimulus checks happened last year, there was some benefit to some of those folks that is eroding over time. And as we look at the rest of the year, that's something that's on our mind.\"</p><p>Also: Walmart says consumers are trading down to private label for items like dairy and bacon</p><p>Rival Target Corp. TGT served as a sort of canary in a coal mine when it announced in early June that it was taking steps, including markdowns, to reduce a glut of inventory. Target CEO Brian Cornell said at the time that the company had also expected a \"post-stimulus slowdown\" but was caught off-guard by the \"magnitude of that shift.\"</p><p>UBS, which maintained its buy stock rating but lowered its price target to $152 from $165 in a note published Monday, said that Walmart may have miscalculated the stimulus impact as well.</p><p>\"[T]here's several factors that are weighing on the velocity of turnover of its discretionary goods, including: misjudging how much of the strength last year was due to stimulus (it was more than the retailer originally thought),\" analysts wrote.</p><p>Other factors include the aforementioned inventory and buying pattern issues.</p><p>Still, analyst groups point out that the company expects Walmart U.S. comp sales to grow 6%, excluding fuel.</p><p>And Stifel's latest consumer spending survey from mid-July shows that spending intentions \"remained solidly positive, up 5%.\" Stifel maintained its hold stock rating on Walmart shares but cut its price target to $145 from $150.</p><p>\"Our data suggests greater trade down amongst more affluent consumers while lower income consumers are generally already purchasing more store brand items. In general, we view trading down to private label as a significant watchpoint givenheightened macroeconomic volatility and share gains for branded offerings since the onset of the pandemic,\" Stifel analysts wrote.</p><p>Spending intentions among those making less than $75,000 per year remains negative, Stifel said, but the survey results suggest a \"bottoming out.\"</p><p>\"This announcement shouldn't come as a total surprise given the aggressive markdown strategy revealed by Target last month, which seems to be having a cascade effect throughout retail,\" wrote CFRA.</p><p>\"On the positive side, Walmart raised its Q2 and FY 23 net sales outlook, noting a strong start to the back-to-school season, and it seems to be doing better at passing cost increases along.\"</p><p>CFRA maintained its buy stock opinion but lowered its price target to $147 from $162.</p><p>And: Inflation is coming for middle-class households as higher prices hit big-box stores. Will they cut back on discretionary purchases?</p><p>Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, which generally serves a more affluent consumer, reported a 20% sales increase in June, though analysts note that no one is immune to the inflationary squeeze.</p><p>Back-to-school, which only trails the holiday shopping season as the most significant for retail spending, could lift, not just Walmart, but other retailers as well.</p><p>The National Retail Federation expects back-to-school spending to match 2021's record of $37 billion, and back-to-college spending is expected to exceed 2021's record of $71 billion to reach $74 billion. Many shoppers are getting an early start on the season to catch a good deal. But there's still more shopping to be done.</p><p>Don't miss: Back-to-school spending expected to reach a new high amid increased spending on mental wellness</p><p>\"A majority (68%) of survey respondents said they have seen higher prices on school items. Clothing and accessories and school supplies were among the top areas where consumers have noticed higher prices,\" the NRF said in a July 14 release.</p><p>\"There is still plenty of shopping outstanding, with the vast majority (85%) of back-to-school and college families indicating they have at least half of their shopping remaining. The top reasons why consumers have not checked items off their list are because they do not know what is needed yet and they are waiting for the best deals.\"</p><p>Walmart customers are spending on food, and not much else, as inflation takes a toll</p>",
