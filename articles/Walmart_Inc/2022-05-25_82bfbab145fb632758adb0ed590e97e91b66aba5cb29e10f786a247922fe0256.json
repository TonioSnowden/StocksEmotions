  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat.</p><p>Consumer-discretionary stocks paced the S&amp;P 500's gain, rising about 2.7% in midday trading. Several retail companies, including Nordstrom and Express, raised their 2022 forecasts, while others such as Dick's Sporting Goods indicated business wasn't getting worse. The brighter outlooks offered investors a welcome change from last week, when Target and Walmart reported disappointing results.</p><p>\"Some investors were expecting retail Armageddon,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The narrative was that this could be another bruising week. Now the market is having a relief rally around the consumer sector.\"</p><p>Stocks have had a bumpy start to the week, buffeted by concerns about the Fed tightening monetary policy to combat the bout of high inflation and how sharp of a slowdown in growth it could cause. The S&amp;P 500 is down nearly 18% from its last record high in January and briefly fell into bear-market territory last Friday before paring losses.</p><p>\"It's been really volatile, to say the least. This is linked to the question of recession, whether that's coming or not. That's effectively what the market has been pushing and pulling between,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros.</p><p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting earlier this month came out at 2 p.m. ET and provided more signals for investors about policymakers' outlooks on the economy and inflation. U.S. durable goods orders for April increased by 0.4%, a slower pace than economists expected.</p><p>Stocks have tumbled in 2022 as investors have adjusted to surging consumer prices and the Fed's response. As rates have climbed and the economy's outlook dimmed, the shares of many companies have looked increasingly expensive, at least relative to their earnings, said Sean O'Hara, president of Pacer ETFs Distributors.</p><p>\"When one goes up,\" Mr. O'Hara said, \"the other has to go down.\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was little changed at 2.760% from 2.758% on Tuesday. It has declined for four of the past five trading sessions. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>\"The market is pricing the slowdown that will eventually come from the Fed tightening. It also forecasts that inflation in 2023 will slow to much more reasonable levels,\" said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Insurance Asset Management.</p><p>Government debt tends to perform well during times of slower economic growth, which has led to a stabilization in the bond market in recent days.</p><p>Oil prices climbed with global benchmark Brent crude rising 0.6% to trade at $111.40 a barrel. The U.S. energy secretary said the Biden administration hasn't ruled out a ban on oil exports to tame domestic fuel prices, Reuters reported.</p><p>In individual stocks, Snap shares added 10%. The Snapchat maker's stock plunged 43% on Tuesday after it issued a profit warning, citing macroeconomic conditions that have deteriorated faster and further than expected.</p><p>\"Clearly there's been a revaluation of tech valuations. It's impossible to know how far it goes, but some of these are quality businesses and significantly cheaper than they have been trading recently,\" Mr. Kamal said. \"If you're a long-term investor, that's going to be something of interest.\"</p><p>Retailer Nordstrom climbed 11% after raising its guidance for full-year revenue growth. Apparel company Express jumped 7.8% after posting a narrower-than-expected loss and raising sales guidance. Dick's rose 9.1%.</p><p>Home builder Toll Brothers rose 5.8% after reporting revenue and profit that beat analysts' expectations.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.6%.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index added 1.2% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng ticked up 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.3%.</p><p>â€”Ryan Dezember contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Higher as Investors Digest Fed Minutes</p>",
