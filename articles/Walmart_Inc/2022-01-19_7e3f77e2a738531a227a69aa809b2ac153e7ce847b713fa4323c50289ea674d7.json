  "text": "<p>Gorillas said it hired Ms. Calvert to help make its brand more internationally recognized. Ms. Calvert will lead Gorilla's global marketing team and report to the company's founder and chief executive, Kağan Sümer.</p><p>In previous roles, Ms. Calvert served as the chief marketing officer for airline company Virgin America and held marketing positions at companies including retailer Walmart Inc. and technology company Alphabet Inc.'s Google.</p><p>Competition among rapid-delivery services has exploded in cities such as New York in recent months, with companies including GoBrands Inc.'s Gopuff, Buyk Corp., Jokr SARL, Fridge No More Inc. and Getir Perakende Lojistik AS offering steep deals for consumers and opening neighborhood \"hubs\" that function as warehouses.</p><p>The companies are competing for investors as well. Gorillas last fall raised nearly $1 billion in a Series C funding round led by established German delivery player Delivery Hero SE. Gopuff last year raised $1 billion from investors including SoftBank Group Corp.</p><p>But despite the investor attention in the space and the proliferation of contenders, rapid delivery thus far doesn't appear to be much of a moneymaker, with companies like Gopuff looking to white-label products to boost margins. Gopuff earlier told The Wall Street Journal that it isn't profitable on the basis of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation or amortization.</p><p>After an influx of new players, the quick-commerce space is \"looking unsustainably over-supplied and profit-challenged,\" according to a November report from retail and technology research and advisory firm Coresight Research. The report said \"consolidation, with some nascent players falling out of the market, looks inevitable given the glut of businesses competing on such similar unique selling points and often on the same turf.\"</p><p>Indeed, one new grocery-delivery entrant, New York-based Fifteen Twenty Inc., stopped service in December after exhausting its funding, Business Insider reported earlier. Its app now directs customers to \"switch your grocery service\" to competitor Getir.</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>Gorillas Hires CMO as Rapid-Grocery-Delivery Race Speeds Up</p>",
