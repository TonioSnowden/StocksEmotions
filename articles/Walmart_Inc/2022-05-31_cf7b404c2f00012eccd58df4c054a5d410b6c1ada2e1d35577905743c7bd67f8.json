Anyone who purchased those brands of berries between March 5 and April 25 and froze them for later consumption should get rid of them immediately, the agency said. </p><p>\n  The products were sold at stores including Aldi, H-E-B, Kroger, Safeway and Weis Markets, along with Trader Joe's and Walmart, the FDA said. </p><p>\n  In a statement on its website, Texas-based H-E-B said its strawberries are safe to consume. </p><p>\n  \"No illnesses from strawberries related to the FDA investigation have been reported at H-E-B or in Texas,\" the company said. \"The FDA is conducting an investigation into organic strawberries sold between March 5 and April 25, 2022. H-E-B has not received or sold organic strawberries from the supplier under investigation since April 16,\" H-E-B said. </p><p>\n  FreshKampo, based in Fresno, Calif., said it is working with the FDA to trace where the problem occurred. </p><p>\n  -- Ginger Adams Otis </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  OBITUARY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Shapiro, 'Seinfeld' </p><p>\n  Executive Producer </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  George Shapiro, the talent manager and producer who helped shape some of comedy's most memorable careers and brought \"Seinfeld\" to television, has died.
