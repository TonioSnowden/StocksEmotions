  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>What can we learn from the latest data and company results about the state of the retail industry and changes in consumer behaviour as the economic mood darkens?</p> <p>Although the big US retailers have ditched talk of a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6272214-0812-458a-98d2-c77e84ade187\">Roaring Twenties,”</a> there are still signs that the sector can weather the downturn. Positive results from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/331a22d4-022e-4639-8ba8-354a6a23c038\">Walmart</a>, the world's largest retailer and a bellwether for US consumer demand, confirm that Americans still love a bargain, even after the company issued a profit warning over a glut of inventory just three weeks ago. </p> <p>Fellow retail giant Home Depot was also buoyant, reporting its highest quarterly sales and earnings on record and that consumers were still spending on home improvements despite rising prices. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff08e566-16e7-4cc4-afd8-701c21673231\">Target</a>, another US bellwether, provided a counterbalance to the optimism, with its discounting efforts leading to a larger than forecast drop in profits. </p> <p>Official data on Wednesday meanwhile showed US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08be8ddf-4841-4cfb-bcb5-a5b6e820dff4#post-e1c00717-5d52-465e-b752-141aa0253706\">retail sales</a> holding up while consumer sentiment appears to be recovering from historically low levels. </p> <p>The picture is much bleaker across the Atlantic with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6149799-f67b-4c73-b4c2-17d0142ea999\">two new sets of data</a> today showing the impact of the cost of living crisis on UK households and their shopping habits. </p> <p>Consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level since records began 50 years ago, according to GfK's monthly survey, while official retail sales data showed people are shopping less.</p> <p>GfK said its survey pointed to a “sense of capitulation, of financial events moving far beyond the control of ordinary people” which would likely lead to “changing buying behaviour, both of which will impact the high street and wider economy”. </p> <p>Weakening consumer demand has also been a key feature in UK retailers' results including yesterday's from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8234ec00-3852-4efe-8e8f-354133287fd2\">AO World</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a48e3cd-d7c7-43bf-af62-c8b8411064c5\">Made.com</a>. Footfall on London's Oxford Street, one of Europe's busiest shopping thoroughfares, is down 60 per cent compared with pre-pandemic times in 2019 and the road is plagued by empty retail space, tatty souvenir stores and mysterious <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/534dc8ab-d8f3-4f6d-bfca-e817c03655f9\">sellers of American sweets</a>.</p> <p>The growth in ecommerce that was turbocharged during the pandemic also appears to be slowing, as evidenced in results from companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc7b4256-ae72-4f4b-b9e9-a109f72e5849\">Zalando</a>, Europe's largest online fashion retailer, and data from countries such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0845366d-b988-4416-a334-3653326c0ac6\">Japan</a>. </p> <p>Retail hopes are now pinned on innovations such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ad7595b-557d-4086-a01e-be5d54b28b45\">livestream ecommerce</a>, a modern version of QVC or the Home Shopping Network, but with social media influencers plugging products. </p> <p>The plumbing that enables ecommerce has also taken a hit. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87469ddf-16a3-48f6-a908-b45e890f63bb\">Shopify</a>, the Canadian platform providing an alternative to selling through Amazon, announced it would axe 10 per cent of its workforce as its bet that the pandemic shopping boom would continue turned sour. &#xa0;</p> <p>Innovation editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d11fd67-5923-4430-b59a-ef6578d21159\">John Thornhill</a> says the direct-to-consumer retail trend is faltering as companies face higher advertising costs on Facebook and obstacles thrown up by Apple complicating customer tracking, on top of the problems faced by traditional retailers.</p> <p>The bigger picture, suggests US investment and industries editor Brooke Masters, is that “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95e2f718-3feb-414d-bf1a-9ac0e5477385\">consumers have soured on stuff</a>”. As western economies rebalance back towards services and away from goods, big companies have been left struggling to adjust, she argues.</p> <p>“Either way, the chance that some companies will get caught out is rapidly rising. There is after all a reason why economists call it discretionary spending,” she concludes.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Italy election frontrunner Giorgia Meloni says she will not put <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50c53dc4-4976-453f-959e-512dd9454022\">Covid funds at risk</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gm-announces-return-capital-shareholders\">General Motors</a> reinstates dividend and resumes share buybacks</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6e37cc7-6383-4183-8abd-3edff46f1037\">Cineworld shares dive</a> on reports of bankruptcy </p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ab0e5b-18e0-414b-924b-9a20aea87707\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The FT revealed prime ministerial frontrunner Liz Truss planned to shake up the UK's <strong>financial regulators</strong>, merging the Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulation Authority and Payments Systems Regulator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af7b6638-c7f5-400b-878d-e56a58bd4151\">into a new body</a>.

A director of regulator <strong>Ofgem</strong> quit in protest at the way changes to the energy price give “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0341b527-0f3f-4417-b281-5f6486273b35\">too much benefit</a> to companies at expense of consumers”. </p> <p><strong>German producer prices</strong> rose at a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ab0e5b-18e0-414b-924b-9a20aea87707#post-4f39c7ae-fa74-441e-aa5c-b3c21fc3775f\">record 37.2 per cent</a> in July, driven by a doubling of energy costs for industrial groups.

This could force large manufacturers, which rely on the smelters for metals such as aluminium and zinc, to turn to overseas producers, helping China and Russia cement their grip on global markets.</p> <p><strong>DP World</strong>, the Dubai-based parent of P&amp;O Ferries, which attracted opprobrium for its mass sacking of crew members, hit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5e0ab85-b0d7-41fa-8dda-f982888983db\">record profits</a> of $721mn in the first half of the year, thanks to a strong performance from its cargo business.</p> <p><strong>US junk bonds </strong>have made a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3cd7b98-eec0-44b1-8060-af543ae59361\">startling recovery</a> as investors bet that the Fed's efforts to curtail inflation will avoid sparking a deep recession. <strong>Quant funds</strong>, which look for trends in the market and then attempt to ride the momentum, are increasing their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1b68d5d-bba5-4552-ac8b-6d71152cf961\">bets on US stocks</a>, helping fuel the recent market rally.</p> <p>The UK financial regulator warned businesses that offer <strong>buy now, pay later</strong> products against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6875b642-e0c5-495e-b751-c08dfcb6abc4\">misleading advertising</a>. </p> <p>The EU is bracing for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c472e2b2-47af-4c99-8745-d3c197360050\">legal challenges</a> to its new legislation setting standards for <strong>Big Tech.</strong></p> <p><strong>Country Garden</strong>, China's largest real estate group, warned that half-year profits could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b52834d-c4fb-497d-9ad0-68cf646536a8\">dive 70 per cent</a>, highlighting the continuing crisis in the country's property market.

The impact was most marked in over 65s, among whom 4.5 per cent developed dementia over the subsequent two years, compared with 3.3 per cent of the control group.</p> <p>The UK became the first country to approve an <strong>Omicron-specific booster</strong>. Moderna's shot targets the original strain of the virus and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffde06e6-afc2-40c0-be45-ed50a61afe7f\">BA.1 variant</a> and is expected to be authorised in other countries shortly.</p> <p>Top US health official Rochelle Walensky said the <strong>Centers for Disease Control</strong> had made “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d482491f-ed0b-41fd-ab63-195cd195b082\">dramatic mistakes</a>” in tackling Covid as she announced a shake-up to improve the CDC's response to emergencies.</p> <p>Although much of the world has reduced or ended <strong>Covid restrictions</strong>, the picture is very different in Japan and much of Asia with tourism <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f6a889c-023e-4df0-ac8b-923fe95f97e2\">still badly affected</a>.
