  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose almost 208 points, or 0.6%, to about 36,295.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX climbed almost 31 points, or 0.7%, to about 4,714.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 118 points, or 0.8%, to 15,972.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each ended fractionally lower. The Russell 2000 RUT index saw a steeper loss of 0.5%.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>Stocks climbed higher Tuesday afternoon as investors parsed fresh data on retail sales and industrial production.</p><p>Retail sales jumped 1.7% in October, the government said, surpassing forecasts for a 1.5% rise and logging the biggest gain since March when households received billions in federal stimulus money. Excluding autos, sales rose 1.4%.</p><p>“It was a strong report,” even with the rise in inflation during the pandemic, said Matt Stucky, a senior portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., in a phone interview Tuesday.&#xa0; “In our view, what's driving that is a very strong recovery from a job and wage perspective,” he said, “along with high levels of excess savings that are still out there on consumer balance sheets.”</p><p>Still, surging inflation was seen taking some of the shine off the retail sales figures.</p><p>“On the surface, the outsized gain in&#xa0;retail&#xa0;sales&#xa0;in October probably looks better than in reality it is,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. “Higher prices account for a good chunk of that increase, and the jump start on holiday shopping is pulling forward some portion of the seasonal end of year spending surge.”</p><p>Meanwhile, industrial production, which includes factory, mining and utility output, increased at a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in October compared with the previous month, according to the Federal Reserve. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.8% increase.</p><p>“We're back to pre-pandemic levels for industrial production,” said Stucky, with a lot more needed in the coming quarters to “replenish” global supply chains. “There just hasn't been enough industrial production really to catch up to a really strong demand environment at the consumer level,” he said.</p><p>In other economic data, the National Association of Home Builders said its monthly confidence index rose 3 points to a reading of 83 in November, its highest since May.</p><p>Investors remain worried about inflation.</p><p>“Uncertainty about the persistence of higher inflation continues to dog investor sentiment amid ongoing speculation about the timing of interest rate hikes by the world's major central banks,” said Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM. “The stronger-than-expected jump in the New York Fed's manufacturing gauge on Monday was the latest data point to highlight long-lasting supply disruptions and rising costs, giving Treasury yields a nudge up.”</p><p>Results from major retailers were rolling in as the reporting season for third-quarter earnings hits the final stretch, with investors on the lookout for any signs of higher shipping or labor costs eroding companies' profit margins.</p><p>“Strong results” from Home Depot Inc. HD and Walmart Inc. WMT are “just further reflection of the strength of the consumer,” said Stucky, adding that “larger companies are better able to deal with some of these supply chain pressures” seen in the pandemic.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Home Depot Inc.HD shares rose 6% after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal third-quarter profit, net sales and same-store sales that beat expectations.</p><p>Shares of Walmart Inc.WMT fell 2.3% after the retail giant raised its full-year earnings guidance for a third consecutive quarter.</p><p>Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc.PTON jumped 13% after the home fitness company said it launched a public offering of $1 billion worth of common stock.</p><p>How are other markets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was little changed at 1.62%. Yields and debt prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, continued to push higher, rising 0.4%.</p><p>Oil futures were little changed, with the U.S. benchmark CL00 at $80.90 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 edged down 0.7% to $1,853.20 an ounce.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP rose 0.2% in a fresh record close, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX declined 0.3%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP fell 0.3%, while the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI rose 1.3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK edged up 0.1%.</p><p>—Steve Goldstein contributed to this report.</p>",
