  "title": "Shooter Who Killed Six at Virginia Walmart Was an Employee; Four others are injured and assailant is dead, Chesapeake police said, in the state's second mass shooting in less than two weeks",
  "text": "<p>The episode happened during a busy Thanksgiving shopping week at a Walmart Supercenter, a sprawling store that sells everything from groceries to clothes and small appliances, about 5 miles south of Norfolk.</p><p>Police didn't identify the shooter on Wednesday morning, only saying he was a current employee because his next of kin hadn't been notified. Authorities have identified the gunman as Andre Bing, born in 1991, according to two law enforcement officials. A SWAT team executed a search warrant at his home, Chief Solesky said.</p><p>In a statement early Wednesday, Walmart Inc. said it was working closely with law-enforcement agencies.</p><p>\"We are shocked at this tragic event at our Chesapeake, Virginia store,\" Walmart said on Twitter. \"We're praying for those impacted, the community and our associates.\"</p><p>A Walmart spokesman declined to comment beyond the company's statement early Wednesday.</p><p>State and federal agencies including the FBI responded to the shooting, police said.</p><p>Chief Solesky said the police didn't know the shooter's motive and he didn't believe there was a threat to the public.</p><p>Police also didn't identify the victims and didn't know the conditions of the four injured people who had been taken to local hospitals.</p><p>At a news briefing Tuesday night, Chesapeake Master Police Officer Leo Kosinski said police officers arrived at the Walmart as the shooting was unfolding. They found multiple dead and injured people over the course of 30 to 45 minutes, he said.</p><p>Chief Solesky said Wednesday morning that police entered the store at 10:16 p.m., four minutes after receiving a call about the shooting, and declared the scene safe around 11:20 p.m.</p><p>Chesapeake Mayor Rick W. West said Wednesday morning that Chesapeake was a tightknit community that was shaken by the news of the shooting.</p><p>\"I'm devastated by the senseless act of violence that took place last night in our city,\" he said.</p><p>The shooting at the Walmart came as Virginia was still reeling from a mass shooting earlier this month in Charlottesville, about 150 miles northwest of Chesapeake. On Nov. 13, a University of Virginia student was suspected of fatally shooting three football players on the Charlottesville campus and injuring two others.</p><p>Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said on Twitter Wednesdaythat heinous acts of violence have no place in the state's communities.</p><p>\"Our hearts break with the community of Chesapeake this morning,\" he said, adding that he had been in contact with law-enforcement officials about the events there.</p><p>Including the shooting at UVA and the Chesapeake Walmart, there have been more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks U.S. shootings. The organization defines a mass shooting as a situation in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.</p><p>Late Saturday, a gunman opened fire in a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo., killing five people and wounding an additional 19.</p><p>The suspect, Anderson Lee Aldrich, was arrested on murder and hate-crime charges in the massacre at Club Q, which was hosting a drag show. The club had planned a brunch for Sunday in honor of Transgender Day of Remembrance.</p><p>He is scheduled to make his first court appearance Wednesday.</p><p>â€”Sarah Nassauer, Sadie Gurman and Thomas Derpinghaus contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Shooter Who Killed Six at Virginia Walmart Was an Employee</p>",
