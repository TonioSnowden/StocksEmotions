  "text": "<p>   Since taking over Twitter Inc., Elon Musk has rapidly made big changes, laying off employees, tweaking posting rules and suspending and reinstating accounts. </p><p>   There's one group he has struggled to manage, one that's vital to the company's future: advertisers. </p><p>   About 70% of Twitter's top 100 ad spenders from before Mr. Musk's takeover weren't spending on the platform as of the week ending Dec. 18, according to an analysis of data from research firm Pathmatics. It's a problem the billionaire can't afford to ignore, since roughly 89% of Twitter's $5.1 billion in revenue last year came from ads. </p><p>   In meetings with advertisers in recent weeks, Mr. Musk's lieutenants have tried to calm fears and drum up interest in the site. They've promised innovations such as ads that allow users to make purchases directly, more video capabilities and tools to keep ads from appearing near objectionable content, according to ad executives familiar with the meetings. </p><p>   Some ad buyers said they will need to see changes at Twitter before they feel comfortable returning. Advertisers say they are concerned about Mr. Musk's moves as owner and CEO, including his abrupt rule-making and controversial tweets. Just as it can be hard to separate the art from the artist, many advertisers are struggling to separate Twitter from Mr. Musk. </p><p>   \"He has made it so that advertisers can't avoid the association. He created that vulnerability and he continues to double down on it,\" said Irwin Gotlieb, a former chief executive of ad-buying giant GroupM. </p><p>   Twitter and Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Musk has said he plans to step down as Twitter CEO based on the results of a Twitter poll he launched last weekend. That raises the prospect he could put some distance between himself and the company, though a new CEO would report to him as the owner. </p><p>   Speaking Tuesday on Twitter Spaces, the platform's live-audio service, Mr. Musk said advertisers have told him they want a healthy return on investment. \"Their requests are not fuzzy or irrational or anything. They're like, quite reasonable,\" he said, adding that when economic times are tough, advertisers ask hard questions. </p><p>   Mr. Musk and his lieutenants have a lot of ground to make up on Madison Avenue. The list of advertising defectors includes United Airlines Holdings Inc., General Mills Inc., General Motors Co., and Pfizer Inc. Several large ad agencies said the majority of their clients have halted spending. </p><p>   Mr. Musk says he wants to lower Twitter's reliance on ad dollars and build a robust subscription business around an $8-a-month paid verification plan, or $11 a month for those who subscribe from an Apple Inc. mobile device. Meanwhile, he and his team haven't given up on bringing advertisers back. </p><p>   Twitter sales executives alerted some marketers on Dec. 14 that Mr. Musk would soon be calling the chief executives of top advertisers that have paused their ad spending, according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Musk, the email said, \"wants to ask what Twitter can do to be helpful.\" </p><p>   Publicly, Mr. Musk has sometimes taken a combative tone with advertisers, at one point threatening to \"thermonuclear name &amp; shame\" advertisers who had left. </p><p>   Privately, in meetings with groups of marketers such as Mastercard Inc. and Unilever PLC, he and top lieutenants have been more measured and respectful, say ad executives familiar with the conversations. Twitter staffers met with ad industry executives on the eve of the U.S. midterm elections, and acknowledged their boss had not been helpful when he recommended in a tweet that independent-minded voters vote for a Republican Congress, said people familiar with the meeting. </p><p>   Getting advertisers to return to Twitter won't be easy. While many brands have halted their ad spending for various reasons, Twitter, unlike Meta Platforms Inc., has limited leverage on Madison Avenue. Advertisers quickly returned to Meta's Facebook and Instagram in 2020 after a brief boycott, partly because advertising on those platforms is a significant driver of sales for many companies. Moreover, there is now a crop of new places for brands to spend their ad dollars, from ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok to streaming services such as Netflix Inc. to retail ad networks such as the one owned by Walmart Inc. </p><p>   \"Twitter is not seen as a go-to channel for brands looking to immediately generate sales or drive people to their websites,\" said Craig Atkinson, chief executive officer of digital marketing agency Code3. Still, the platform can help brands generate buzz by tapping into a \"cultural moment,\" he said. </p><p>   Advertisers are also in retrench mode as they face economic headwinds, an ad slowdown that is already affecting a wide range of technology companies, digital publishers and U.S. television networks. </p><p>   In interviews, several advertising executives in sectors ranging from software to consumer packaged goods to beverages said Mr. Musk is making it harder for them to return to the platform. Several executives pointed to Mr. Musk's habit of conducting Twitter polls about major decisions, including whether or not he should be its lead, as a sign of recklessness. </p><p>   Some cited Mr. Musk's tweets, such as one that read, \"My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,\" saying it was an offensive denigration of both departing White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci and transgender or nonbinary people. </p><p>   Despite the wave of advertising defections, many brands continue to spend on Twitter, including Amazon.com Inc., Walt Disney Co., Walmart Inc., PepsiCo Inc., and the National Football League, according to Pathmatics data. Ad executives said that entertainment companies, publishers and quick-service restaurants, in particular, have been actively spending on Twitter. </p><p>   \"It's a strong platform for us during the Super Bowl and I try to be objective and not let my personal opinions interfere in what is good for my business,\" said Ivonne Kinser, vice president of marketing for Avocados From Mexico, a nonprofit marketing organization that represents avocado growers that has continued to spend on Twitter. </p><p>   Still, Ms. Kinser is keeping close watch of Mr. Musk's actions. \"If he crosses the line beyond a certain point I will pull out,\" she said. \"He is dancing on sensitive lines.\" </p><p>   The difficult job of pitching Twitter to marketers day-to-day falls to Chris Riedy, a 47-year-old, who became the advertising sales czar after several top executives were fired or left in the wake of the takeover. </p><p>   Mr. Riedy started with the company roughly a decade ago in Twitter's San Francisco office and eventually handled advertisers in the retail, travel and financial services industries. He spent the past couple of years overseas, where he led Twitter's business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. </p><p>   In dealings with advertisers, Mr. Riedy and his team voice confidence. Twitter is \"seeing advertisers turn back on,\" the sales team said in a recent email to a consumer packaged goods company, according to a copy reviewed by the Journal. </p><p>   Twitter has offered advertisers incentives, including an offer to match spending up to a $1 million cap for ads that run before the end of the year, in a buy-one-get-one style deal, the Journal has reported. </p><p>   To advertisers who have raised concerns about how they can decouple Mr. Musk from Twitter, Mr. Riedy and his staff have responded that Mr. Musk is going to continue to be himself on the platform and that the ad team is going to focus on meeting advertisers' objectives for their campaigns, according to people familiar with the meetings. </p><p>   Mr. Riedy's team has reached out to some advertisers asking them to participate in brand-safety beta programs Twitter is testing, according to emails reviewed by the Journal, including one, which recently launched, that would let brands prevent their ads from appearing near tweets that contain specific words. Reuters earlier reported Twitter's rollout of brand-safety tools. </p><p>   Mr. Musk himself hasn't been as available as some agencies would like. Ad-buying giant Dentsu Inc. had finally set a meeting with the billionaire this week, after weeks of trying to schedule. Mr. Musk canceled, frustrating some agency executives, people familiar with the situation said. </p><p>   Several of Mr. Musk's tweets and decisions after taking over the platform alarmed advertisers. A few days after the deal closed, Mr. Musk tweeted a link to an article with unsubstantiated claims about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, writing, \"There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.\" </p><p>   An executive at one brand that advertised on Twitter took a screenshot of the tweet, which has now been deleted, and emailed it to the firm's ad agency, instructing that spending should be paused, according to an ad buyer familiar with the situation. </p><p>   Soon, several ad agencies were recommending that their clients pause Twitter ads, with Interpublic Group of Cos. citing research showing \"a rise in inappropriate behavior\" in the days after Mr. Musk's takeover. </p><p>   Though Mr. Musk had promised to set up a content-moderation council, his decision to reinstate former President Donald Trump's account, which he said he based on a Twitter poll he conducted himself, worried some advertisers. </p><p>   Mr. Musk addressed concerns that his conduct was affecting the Twitter brand in a November talk with advertisers on Twitter Spaces. \"Twitter must be, as a platform, as neutral as possible. That doesn't mean I'm completely neutral,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Musk and his lieutenants sought to win over advertisers and trade groups in a series of emails, video calls and meetings. But as advertisers continued to pull out, he vented his frustrations on Twitter, including a tweet in which he blamed activists for causing a \"massive drop in revenue.\" </p><p></p>",
