  "text": "<p>Since its 2016 launch, Goldman's Marcus has expanded beyond its original offering -- high-yield savings accounts -- and into unsecured installment loans, personal budgeting software, digital-investing tools and, soon, checking accounts. Goldman also nabbed deals to issue credit cards for Apple Inc. and General Motors Co., the Journal previously reported.</p><p>Along the way, Goldman has experienced a number of growing pains, including higher-than-expected loan losses, product delays and executive turnover. Mr. Nahar will fill a role vacated earlier this year when Marcus chief Omer Ismail left Goldman to run Walmart Inc.'s new fintech startup.</p><p>One of Mr. Nahar's tasks will be achieving targets that Goldman executives had set for Marcus before the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. Those include amassing more than $20 billion of loan balances and attracting more than $125 billion of deposits by 2024.</p>",
