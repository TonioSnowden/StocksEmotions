  "title": "Banking & Finance:  BayPine Gets Halfway  To Debut Fund's Goal  ----  By Preeti Singh",
  "text": "<p>   BayPine LP, which was co-founded by Silver Lake co-founder David Roux, rounded up at least $1.1 billion in an initial closing on its debut fund, putting the fund more than halfway to a $2 billion goal, according to people familiar with the offering. </p><p>   Boston-based BayPine itself is committing about $100 million, one of the people said. </p><p>   Mr. Roux set up BayPine last year along with Anjan Mukherjee, a former senior executive at Blackstone Group Inc. BayPine looks to acquire controlling stakes in businesses across several sectors to help facilitate their digital transformations, according to a regulatory filing. The firm couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Mukherjee, who left Blackstone in 2015 to join the Treasury Department as an adviser on markets and financial institutions, was a core member of Blackstone's private-equity team. </p><p>   BayPine has assembled a team, which has a mix of professionals with investment and operational experience, to source and execute on investments, one of the people said. The firm pulled professionals from several private-equity firms including Bain Capital and Madison Dearborn Partners, according to its website. </p><p>   The firm's founding partners include Wan Ling Martello, Marius Haas, Steve Ko and Brian Frank. Ms. Martello previously held leadership roles at Nestle SA and Walmart Inc., among other companies, and has expertise helping companies with digital transformation. </p><p>   BayPine has backed at least one investment. Last month, it backed digital learning company Penn Foster Inc. to help accelerate the build-out of its digital learning platform for front-line workers. </p><p></p>",
