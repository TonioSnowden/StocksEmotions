  "text": "<p>The retailer is clearly seeing the effects of animproved pricing strategy under Rick Dreiling, a former Dollar General chief executive who joined as an executive chairman earlier this year. The company has been raising prices at its namesake Dollar Tree stores, whose customers tend to be middle-income suburban consumers seeking discretionary purchases such as party items. The introduction of its $1.25 price pointand the wider rollout of $3 and $5 items has helped the chain improve gross margins by 5.2 percentage points last quarter compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Meanwhile, Family Dollar, which caters to lower-income consumers seeking essentials, saw growth in same-store traffic for the first time in three years after bringing prices down. In the earnings call on Tuesday, Mr. Dreiling said Family Dollar's prices are now on par with key competitors and cheaper compared with grocery and drugstores.</p><p>Investors might need more compelling evidence that consumers are migrating to dollar stores, though. Despite better-than-expected results and an upgrade in the full-year sales guidance, Dollar Tree's stock fell 9% following Tuesday's earnings call.</p><p>One clear positive sign was that Dollar Tree saw same-store sales growth improving every month at both store chains. This stands in contrast to retailers such as Target, Macy's and Kohl's, which all pointed to worsening demandthrough the quarter.</p><p>Yet store traffic looks disappointing at both chains, especially compared with big-box retailers Walmart and Target. Though Family Dollar did see same-store traffic growth last quarter, it was just a 0.1% increase following a 3% decline the prior year. Meanwhile, Dollar Tree's growth in same-store sales this year has been entirely driven by pricing increases rather than traffic, which has declined for five consecutive quarters. By contrast, big-box retailers have been drawing in more transactions: Target has seen same-store traffic grow for at least seven consecutive quarters, while traffic at Walmart's U.S. business has been growing or flat for six consecutive quarters.</p><p>Pricing tweaks might have made the income statement look better, but it will take sustained traffic growth to prove that change at Dollar Tree is deep rooted.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Dollar Tree's Green Shoots Aren't Strong Enough</p>",
