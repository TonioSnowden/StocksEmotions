  "text": "<p>Until then, Mr. Dunn had hidden the bipolar disorder he had struggled with since college. But after the violent episode, he revealed all to his board and colleagues. He kept his job, and a year later, sold Bonobos for $310 million to Walmart Inc. He left Walmart in 2020.</p><p>In \"Burn Rate,\" he recounts his struggles with his \"ghost\" -- the name he gave his bipolar disorder -- and explores the intersection of entrepreneurship and mental illness. He spoke with The Wall Street Journal's Ellie Austin at The Future of Everything Festival last week. Here are edited excerpts:</p><p>WSJ: At what point did you decide you wanted to write about your \"ghost\"?</p><p>Mr. Dunn: 2016 was a hard year. It was, 'How am I going to get healthy? Is my girlfriend going to leave me? Am I going to lose my job?' I was in and out of court, and it was six months of pretty catatonic depression, as so often follows the high high.</p><p>She stayed with me, and eventually I got on the medication mixture that enabled me to come back to life. Then, the next year: 10-year anniversary of the company, sold it, got married. It was this magical year, and it was such airbrushed, photoshopped B.S. compared to what actually happened.</p><p>So after three years at Walmart, I was thinking, 'What do I do next?' I felt like telling this story with a mission of normalizing disclosure of mental illness.</p><p>One in five entrepreneurs is dealing with a mood disorder, to say nothing of addiction, substance abuse, narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality.</p><p>We're already here facing these issues.</p><p>When I disclosed to my colleagues that I had this, it wasn't like, 'Oh, my God.' They were like, 'Uh-huh. Yeah.' They knew, even if they didn't know how profound the extremes were.</p><p>I never felt so connected to my team as when I started to disclose this. You actually inspire more followship and become a more nuanced, textured, authentic leader if you're willing to go there.</p><p>WSJ: Did you feel at any point penalized that you have bipolar disorder?</p><p>Mr. Dunn: I had a scary moment. It was time for Walmart to do background checks on me and everyone in the executive team, and I said, 'Look, you may find this record of an arrest. Here's what the issue is: I have been living for 16 years with Bipolar 1, I was in denial of it, I was unmedicated and untreated. Then I had this second manic episode last year, and I was violent when I was manic.'</p><p>The woman who was an HR business partner at Walmart said, 'You know, Andy, it happens. All of us face challenges. Let me talk to [Walmart CEO] Doug McMillon and the team.' I had two weeks of wondering, 'Oh, my God. What's going to happen here?' Then they came back and said, 'We've reviewed it, our outside doctor said you've got a clean bill of health, you're in therapy, you're doing a great job. Everyone's excited to just move forward.'</p>",
