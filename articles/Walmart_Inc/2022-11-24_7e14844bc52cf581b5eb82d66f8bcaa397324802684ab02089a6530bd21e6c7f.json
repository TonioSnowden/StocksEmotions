  "title": "Man Suspected of Killing Six at Virginia Walmart Was an Employee; At least six others are injured and assailant is dead, according to Chesapeake police; 'My heart hurts for our associates,' says Walmart CEO",
  "text": "<p>Police said at least 50 people were inside the store. The episode happened during a busy Thanksgiving shopping week at a Walmart Supercenter, a store that sells everything from groceries to clothes and small appliances, about 5 miles south of Norfolk, Va.</p><p>The shooter and two victims were found dead in the store's break room, city officials said on Twitter. Another person was found dead near the front of the Walmart. Three other victims died at local hospitals.</p><p>Yellow crime-scene tape surrounded the storefront as a handful of police cars still flashed their lights early Wednesday evening. A memorial—including one bearing the name of one of the victims, Tyneka Johnson—sat near a bouquet of roses in the store's parking lot.</p><p>Four bystanders stood praying for the victims and their families, including Deirdre Blumenthal, 42 years old, of Chesapeake. \"We felt a prompting in our hearts to come over here and pray for them,\" Ms. Blumenthal said.</p><p>Authorities identified the gunman as Andre Bing, 31, of Chesapeake. A city SWAT team executed a search warrant at the gunman's home, the police said.</p><p>The alleged gunman worked at Walmart since 2010, a Walmart spokesman said in a statement. \"At this time, we do not have any reason to believe there is a continued threat to our Chesapeake store or any other Walmart facility,\" the company said in a memo to employees. The store was set to be closed for several days, city officials said.</p><p>Chesapeake officials said they didn't know the shooter's motive and that he had acted alone.</p><p>Mr. Bing could be combative and difficult to work with, according to two former co-workers. In interviews with The Wall Street Journal, they said he would cover his cellphone camera with tape because he said he worried the government was tracking him.</p><p>Shaundrayia Reese, who worked at the Walmart until 2018, said he would pick on people and then get mad when they bullied him back. \"I always knew something was wrong with him, but I never thought he would do something like this,\" said Ms. Reese, 27.</p><p>Nathan Sinclair, who worked at the Walmart until a few weeks ago, said he once had an argument with Mr. Bing over pallets that needed to be unloaded off a truck—a task Mr. Sinclair said he was doing past the end of his work shift and not getting any help. Mr. Bing instructed him to finish unloading before he thought of leaving, said Mr. Sinclair, 21.</p><p>\"His attitude, his demeanor, the way that he handled a lot of situations, wasn't very professional,\" Mr. Sinclair said.</p><p>Walmart Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Wednesday on social media that \"news of last night's shooting at our Chesapeake, VA store at the hands of one of our associates has hit our Walmart family hard. \" Mr. McMillon said in a post: \"My heart hurts for our associates and the Chesapeake community who have lost or injured loved ones.\"</p><p>Walmart said it was working closely with law-enforcement agencies.</p><p>Chesapeake officials said that at least six other injured people, whom they didn't identify, were taken to hospitals.</p><p>The shooting was one of many in recent years, including at Walmart, a store that often acts as a community gathering place. It had echoes of the 2019 shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. A suspect, who didn't work there and whom authorities said wanted to kill Latino people, allegedly fatally shot 23 people in a crowded store. The alleged gunman pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.</p><p>Walmart asks shoppers not to openly carry firearms in stores unless they are authorized law enforcement. It does allow shoppers who are concealed-carry permit holders to do so in stores in line with state and local laws, according to the retailer's website.</p><p>Walmart workers aren't allowed to bring weapons, including firearms, to work, said the Walmart spokesman. The policy is a topic of debate on online message boards among some employees who think they should have firearms for protection. The company hires private security staff in some locations.</p><p>Walmart stopped selling many types of firearms and ammunition in recent years.</p><p>In Chesapeake, Chief Solesky said that police entered the store at 10:16 p.m. Eastern time, four minutes after receiving a call about the shooting, and declared the scene safe around 11:20 p.m. State and federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation responded to the shooting, police said.</p><p>Politicians including President Biden, a Democrat, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, condemned the violence in Chesapeake. The White House said Mr. Biden spoke with the governor Wednesday afternoon to offer his support and any federal assistance.</p><p>The shooting at the Walmart came as Virginia was still reeling from a mass shooting earlier this month in Charlottesville, about 150 miles northwest of Chesapeake. On Nov. 13, a University of Virginia student was suspected of fatally shooting three football players on the Charlottesville campus and injuring two others.</p><p>Last weekend, a suspect shot and killed five people and wounded 19 others in a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. He faces murder and hate-crime charges.</p><p>Including the shootings at the University of Virginia and the Chesapeake Walmart, there have been more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks U.S. shootings. The organization defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.</p><p>Past shootings have involved disgruntled employees. Last year, an employee at a light-rail facility in San Jose, Calif., and a former employee at a FedEx Corp. facility in Indianapolis each fatally shot workers.</p><p>In 2019, a factory employee fatally shot five colleagues during a meeting in which he was being fired in Aurora, Ill. Later that year, in Virginia Beach, Va., a municipal employee in 2019 killed 12 people in a city building hours after he had been terminated.</p><p>—Sadie Gurman and Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com and Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Man Suspected of Killing Six at Virginia Walmart Was an Employee</p>",
