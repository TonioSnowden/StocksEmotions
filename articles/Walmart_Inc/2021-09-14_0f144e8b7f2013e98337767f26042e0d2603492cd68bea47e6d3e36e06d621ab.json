  "text": "<p>The news release, purportedly from Walmart, claimed the retailer would allow customers to make payments with the cryptocurrency. Walmart shares fell 83 cents at $145.06.</p><p>\"The press release is not authentic,\" said a Walmart spokeswoman. Walmart doesn't accept cryptocurrency as payment in the U.S., she said.</p><p>Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said the release wasn't connected to the cryptocurrency or the Litecoin Foundation, a nonprofit that manages it as a software project. \"Yeah, it's fake,\" he said. \"Don't know who created it.\"</p><p>The Litecoin Foundation's social-media manager was fooled by the fake release, Mr. Lee said, and retweeted it from the foundation's Twitter account.</p><p>\"He thought it was real, too,\" he said. \"It was wrong to retweet it. We deleted it quickly afterwards. But the damage is done.\"</p><p>Mr. Lee created litecoin in 2011 as an alternative to bitcoin, taking the latter's code and tweaking it to create a digital currency with lower fees and faster confirmation times.</p><p>It has been one of the more well-known cryptocurrencies but never grew into much more than a curiosity. With a market value of about $11.9 billion, litecoin is the 16th-largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap.</p><p>GlobeNewswire issued a written statement that \"journalists and other readers should disregard the news release.\"</p>",
