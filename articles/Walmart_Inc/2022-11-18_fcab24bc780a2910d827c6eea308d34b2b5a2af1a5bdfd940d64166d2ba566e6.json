  "title": "Macy's, Kohl's Results Fall --- Retailers say holiday season is uncertain amid inflation; steep promotions hit profits",
  "text": "<p>While sales picked up slightly in November as colder weather spurred demand for coats, boots and other winter gear, the companies said the outlook for the important year-end quarter remained uncertain.</p><p>Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said consumers are still in good financial shape and all signs point to them spending during the holiday season. But he added it was unclear whether the later start to holiday shopping this year could presage the beginning of a broader slowdown.</p><p>\"I'm not ready to call it,\" Mr. Gennette said. \"We just don't know yet.\"</p><p>Macy's reaffirmed its sales guidance for the year and increased its earnings outlook on stronger credit-card revenue.</p><p>Kohl's Chairman Peter Boneparth told analysts that getting a good read on the fourth quarter has been as difficult as any period he can remember. Kohl's withdrew its guidance for the fourth quarter and full year as it searches for a new chief executive, after Michelle Gass said this month she was leaving to join Levi Strauss &amp; Co. amid activist pressure to find new leadership.</p><p>Macy's shares gained 15% on Thursday while Kohl's gained about 5%. Through Thursday's close, Macy's stock is down 13% so far this year and Kohl's is down 36%.</p><p>The sales declines at Macy's and Kohl's followed mixed results earlier in the week from Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. Walmart reported stronger-than-expected sales driven by demand for groceries. Target's sales slowed, and it lowered its financial goals for the fourth quarter as shoppers curtailed spending at the chain.</p><p>On Thursday, Gap Inc. said third-quarter sales rose 2% to $4.04 billion driven by a recovery at its Old Navy chain and strength at Banana Republic. It swung to a profit of $282 million from a $152 million loss a year earlier.</p><p>The company took a $53 million charge to end its Yeezy Gap partnership with Kanye West. Promotions to clear excess inventory hit margins. Gap said sales could be down in the mid-single digit percentage range for the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Macy's sales fell 3.9% to $5.2 billion in the three months ended Oct. 29, compared with a year earlier. Sales excluding newly opened or closed locations fell 3.1%. Including licensed departments, they were down 2.7%.</p><p>Net income more than halved to $108 million, hurt by higher promotions to clear excess merchandise.</p><p>Inventory was up 4% compared with a year ago, leaving Macy's in a better position than some rivals who have bloated stocks.</p><p>Kohl's net sales fell 7.2% to $4.1 billion in the three months ended Oct. 29, compared with the year-earlier period. Sales excluding newly opened or closed locations were down 6.9%.</p><p>Net income dropped 60% to $97 million. Inventories were up 34%.</p><p>Kohl's has been under pressure from activist investors, who called for the removal of its CEO and chairman and pushed the company to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale and leaseback of its real estate. On Thursday, Kohl's said it won't pursue a large real-estate deal after exploring the idea with various parties.</p><p>Mr. Boneparth said the company isn't looking for a new leader to change its strategy, but rather someone adept at the basics of retailing, including brand building, who can improve its operations. He said interim CEO Tom Kingsbury agreed to remain at the helm until a permanent successor is found.</p><p>Macy's and Kohl's said the buying patterns of shoppers this year are reverting to pre-pandemic trends, when they tended to wait until after Thanksgiving to do the bulk of their buying in the hopes of scoring last-minute deals. That is especially true this year with an extra day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Mr. Gennette said.</p><p>---</p><p>Sabela Ojea contributed to this article.</p>",
