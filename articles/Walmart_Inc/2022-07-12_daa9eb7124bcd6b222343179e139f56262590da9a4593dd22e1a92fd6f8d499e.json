  "title": "No Prime Day for Walmart; Retailer's pass on competing with Amazon's Prime Day signals a slow and steady approach toward its own membership program",
  "text": "<p>Though Walmart hasn't said why it won't be holding a Prime Day-adjacent event, one reason could be that directing more clearance and deals through stores—rather than online—would be better for its already-declining bottom line. In a report published last week, Oppenheimer analysts including Rupesh Parikh observed that Walmart stores in northern New Jersey had higher-than-normal levels of clearance inventory, especially in apparel. The retailer said earlier it had roughly 32% more inventory in its quarter ended April 30 than a year earlier.</p><p>Walmart launched its Amazon Prime-like membership program Walmart+ in September 2020. While most Walmart+ members join because of free shipping (83% of members cited that as a reason for joining, according to a Numerator survey), fulfilling those orders has gotten much more expensive. Diesel prices are nearly 73% higher than a year ago, according to AAA. The retailer cited higher-than-expected e-commerce fulfillment costs as one reason its gross margins deteriorated last quarter. The company recently told some suppliers that it will impose a fuel surcharge to transport goods to its warehouses and stores.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will you be partaking in this year's Prime Day? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>And while Walmart did hold its own deal event in early June, Walmart+ Weekend was relatively low-profile. Walmart.com web traffic that month was up just 3.7% from the preceding month, according to Similarweb. Only a third of shoppers that weekend said they were aware of the event before shopping, according to a survey by Numerator. By contrast, 94% of Prime Day shoppers in 2021 knew of the event beforehand.</p><p>Walmart has shied away from tangible updates on the Walmart+ program since its introduction. An estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners pegs total membership at roughly 11 million as of the three-month period ended April, compared with Amazon's estimated 170 million U.S. members. Walmart+ membership numbers actually declined slightly in the most recent quarter, CIRP estimates.</p><p>That might not be such a bad thing for Walmart. In a research note last year, Cowen analysts said they don't expect a \"major acceleration\" in Walmart+ membership growth, as the company's management remains focused on \"strengthening execution before stepping up marketing efforts.\" John Furner, chief executive of Walmart U.S., said on a call with investors last month that the early days of the membership program were \"tough\" because availability and process issues left customers frustrated. He said the company is still ironing out some features, including one that allows communication between the person picking up goods and the customer.</p><p>And while Walmart has added some new benefits this year, it will likely take a while to compete with Amazon Prime's perks, which now include free one-year access to Grubhub's food-delivery membership. Walmart in March announced a free six-month subscription to Spotify Premium for Walmart+ members, and in April introduced a larger fuel discount for members (to 10 cents a gallon from 5 cents).</p><p>Improving the Walmart+ experience may be one reason to postpone a membership-marketing push. This year's surging expenses could add yet another speed bump.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>No Prime Day for Walmart</p>",
