  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Albertsons  Faces  Outrage  In Aisle Five  ---  Dividend stokes anger,  but uproar is overblown  ----  By Jinjoo Lee",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Want to stoke public anger about food prices and corporate greed? Supermarket giant Albertsons Cos., which announced a merger accord with Kroger Co. last month alongside a generous special dividend payout, unwittingly did just that. </p><p>\n  The company was due to distribute $4 billion in special dividends to shareholders Monday but was blocked from doing so Thursday by a Washington state court's temporary restraining order. Albertsons said it seeks to overturn the restraint as quickly as possible. Attorneys general of California, Illinois and Washington, D.C., also sought a temporary restraining order last week to stop the dividend payout. </p><p>\n  Washington state's attorney general argued that paying the dividend would leave Albertsons financially weakened, less able to compete with Kroger during the antitrust-review process. He suggested Kroger could use that point to its advantage -- by arguing Albertsons would go bankrupt without the merger. </p><p>\n  It is a tenuous theory. While Albertsons' credit rating falls under the non-investment-grade umbrella, its financial position has never been better. Its net debt as of last quarter roughly equaled its trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet -- a ratio about on par with that of Walmart Inc. Kroger held 1.4 times as much net debt as Ebitda in its most recent quarter. The payout would leave Albertsons' net debt at roughly 1.9 times Ebitda, around where it was a year ago. </p><p>\n  Credit-rating company Moody's, which uses total debt and factors in lease liabilities, expects Albertsons' debt-to-Ebitda ratio to return to its end-of-fiscal-2021 level a year or so after the special dividend is paid out. Chedly Louis, senior credit officer at Moody's, noted Albertsons is expected to retain good liquidity following the special dividend payout even if the merger doesn't go through. \"They performed very well during the pandemic and repaid a lot of debt, so they do have flexibility to pay the dividend,\" she said. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, the interest rate on the asset-based loan that Albertsons will draw from to fund the dividend payout is fairly modest at 1.25 to 1.5 percentage points over Libor. </p><p>\n  So while the dividend itself shouldn't be all that controversial, its timing might be. A generous special dividend by a supermarket chain that is majority owned by private-equity investors (at a time of record food inflation) was bound to stoke anger about consumer choice and private-equity greed. Yet announcing a dividend before the merger pact would have been more problematic: A public Albertsons shareholder that chose to sell its stock soon after pocketing the dividend could have felt misled if it emerged later that Albertsons was in talks about a deal that would lift its stock. </p><p>\n  The outrage over the payout and the deal is overblown: Albertsons and Kroger are in an industry with razor-thin margins. Combining would help them scale up and compete with well-capitalized e-commerce rivals. In any case, the chains' combined grocery market share would fall short of that of Walmart, which has stores within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population and is unlikely to give up its everyday-low-prices positioning.The pushback the deal is facing doesn't bode well for Albertsons' shareholders who were looking for a rare bonanza in a tough business. </p><p></p>",
