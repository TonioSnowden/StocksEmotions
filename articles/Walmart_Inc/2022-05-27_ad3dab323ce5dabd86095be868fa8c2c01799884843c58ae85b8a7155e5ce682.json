  "text": "<p>\"Stronger growth has been funded by reduced saving,\" said Michael Pearce, senior economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>A closely watched U.S. inflation reading, meanwhile, decelerated slightly for the first time this year but remained near a four-decade high. Consumer prices rose 6.3% in April from a year earlier, down from 6.6% in March, as measured by the Commerce Department's personal-consumption expenditures price index.</p><p>The PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation reading. The March rise was the fastest since January 1982. April's reading was the first time the measure eased since late 2020.</p><p>Minutes from the Fed's May 3-4 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that officials discussed the possibility of raising interest rates to levels high enough to deliberately slow economic growth as the central bank races to combat high inflation.</p><p>The Commerce Department said personal income rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% last month. Adjusted for inflation, disposable income was flat during the month, showing that wage increases are struggling to keep up with price rises and that consumers are drawing on their savings to make purchases.</p><p>Higher-income consumers are likely healthy enough to continue funding their spending through savings for a while. \"Excess savings are pretty significant,\" said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at U.S. Bank. \"People kept it in cash and bank accounts. We've had a huge drawdown in the markets, but people's cash values are still above where they were prepandemic.\"</p><p>The April report showed consumers spent briskly on both goods and services. High inflation and changes in spending patterns have led to a mixed outlook for retailers, while the leisure and travel industries are seeing stronger demand.</p><p>Major retailers such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. have reported weaker profits, and Best Buy Co. downgraded its expectations. But discount retailers Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree reported earnings that beat expectations.</p><p>Inflation is hitting lower-income households hardest, economists say, and will cause them to forgo discretionary purchases sooner than wealthier households that have more savings and better access to credit.</p><p>\"With inflation particularly hitting food and gasoline, lower-income consumers are pretty much done with discretionary spending from their savings,\" said Amy Crews Cutts, an economist and president of AC Cutts &amp; Associates.</p><p>In March, the savings rate fell to 6.2%, the lowest in nine years, suggesting that many Americans are tapping their savings to offset cost increases.</p><p>Inflation isn't hurting demand uniformly across the economy, and many businesses in the service sector—especially in travel, leisure and hospitality—are preparing for a strong summer.</p><p>Sean Mackey, owner of the Magic Shuttle Bus, a winery tour and wedding transportation company in Traverse City, Mich., said he has been able to raise prices by 18% in the past year to keep up with rising fuel and insurance costs and still expects to have one of his best years.</p><p>\"We're really getting into our high peak season right now—close to what we saw last year,\" said Mr. Mackey, whose company owns 12 buses in the northern Michigan summer hot spot. Still, he is wary of passing his rising costs along to customers since his business depends on marketing itself as an affordable, nonluxury service.</p><p>\"There's a certain point you can raise prices to where it's excessive, and we've tried to avoid that,\" he said.</p><p>Consumers who continue to spend on big-ticket items such as furniture and appliances might be looking to offset higher costs by reining in spending in other areas.</p><p>Colette Prideaux, 25 years old, is moving from New York City to the Nashville area to be closer to family. As a nurse, she said she took a pay cut to move from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she made around $100,000, to a Vanderbilt University hospital where she will make around $75,000, though the difference is less stark when factoring in cost-of-living and tax differences between New York and Tennessee.</p><p>Ms. Prideaux bought a new Volkswagen Jetta ahead of her move because her commute requires it, a change from taking public transportation in New York. She wanted to spend around $20,000 on a car, or lease one for $300 a month or less, but couldn't find anything close to her price range. \"The leasing prices were absurd. There was nothing under $500, even for used cars,\" she said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Did your household spending change in April? If so, how? Join the conversation below.</p><p>She ended up buying the Jetta for around $25,000, with monthly payments just under $400, not including insurance. She plans to delay a move into the city of Nashville and stay with family in suburban Franklin, Tenn., since studio apartments in the city have prices that \"aren't all that different from New York,\" Ms. Prideaux said.</p><p>With shortages of critical components such as semiconductors holding down new-car inventory on dealer lots, and with high demand keeping used-car prices elevated, Ms. Prideaux said she regrets that she couldn't postpone her purchase until price pressures could abate somewhat.</p><p>\"Did I really want to buy a car? Not really—I wish I could have waited,\" she said. \"But I needed one now.\"</p><p>Gwynn Guilford contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Gabriel T.
