  "title": "Business News:  Walmart  To Hire  5,000 for  Tech Staff  ----  By Isabelle Bousquette",
  "text": "<p>    Walmart Inc.'s technology organization, Walmart Global Tech, aims to hire 5,000 technology associates globally during this fiscal year and open new hubs in Toronto and Atlanta as part of its expansion plans, the retailer said. </p><p>   Chief Technology Officer and Chief Development Officer Suresh Kumar said he is looking to fill roles in cybersecurity, architecture, development, software engineering, data science, data engineering, technical program management, and product management. </p><p>   He said the new hires would work on technology across Walmart's business, including customer experience, associate experience and back end systems like supply chain. </p><p>   \"We are pretty much all in on tech innovation,\" Mr. Kumar said, noting the Walmart Global Tech team grew 26% last year and now has more than 20,000 employees. </p><p>   Opportunities to hone skills on cutting-edge technology make Walmart attractive to job seekers, he added. </p><p>   For example, Walmart recently used augmented reality to allow associates to track and map boxes around backrooms and locate products more easily, Mr. Kumar said. </p><p>   The company also developed an artificial-intelligence-powered shopping tool to help customers determine the best substitutes for grocery items that are out of stock, he said. </p><p>   Additionally, Walmart has been building more automated fulfillment centers attached to existing stores and experimenting with autonomous trucks as part of an effort to move online inventory as the pandemic-related e-commerce surge shows signs of cooling. </p><p>   Before the addition of the two new hubs, Walmart Global Tech already had 15 hubs in places that included Silicon Valley and Bangalore, India. </p><p></p>",
