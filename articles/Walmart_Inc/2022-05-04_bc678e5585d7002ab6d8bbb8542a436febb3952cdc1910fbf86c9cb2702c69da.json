  "text": "<p>Now, things are quite different. Along with rising competition in the e-commerce space -- some of it from politically connected homegrown champions -- a government crackdown on the sector writ large will likely intensify.</p><p>Late last week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) raided the top sellers on Amazon.com Inc.'s and Walmart-backed Flipkart's online marketplaces, seizing data and documents on allegations that the e-commerce companies were promoting preferred sellers on their websites, according Reuters. The CCI's actions are part of an investigation it ordered two years ago but was stalled after the companies appealed to the courts.</p><p>Meanwhile, India is piloting its Open Network for Digital Commerce, or ONDC, an open technology network that aims to help small retailers gain the reach and economies of scale of e-commerce giants -- i.e. level the playing field for small merchants and loosen the grip of Amazon and Walmart.</p><p>The two developments played out almost simultaneously, making it clear India is no longer bending over backward to chase foreign investment for its booming internet sector. It would instead like to protect small merchants and homegrown alternatives -- a theme that has been playing out over the past few years in various foreign-investment policies and self-reliance campaigns. Indian laws already don't allow companies like Amazon to hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers as they do elsewhere. To circumvent this, foreign e-commerce firms operate through a complicated maze of joint ventures with local companies that function as inventory-holding firms.</p><p>In a sign of the prevailing sentiment, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said in 2020 that Amazon wasn't doing the country a favor by investing more there. The government appears to believe that a hostile regulatory environment won't cause foreign e-commerce companies to retrench, given the size of the potential opportunity. The Amazon-Flipkart duopoly is fast becoming a four-way competition as Reliance Digital and Tata join the fray, signaling tougher local competition ahead. Forrester Research estimates that Amazon, Flipkart and such local giants collectively own more than 80% of India's online retail market, with each maneuvering to gain market share.</p><p>India is home to the third-largest online shopper base of 140 million, only behind China and the U.S., according to a report by Bain, which added that the market is still largely untapped given India's internet-user base of about 625 million to 675 million people. As in other places, the pandemic has also driven rising adoption of e-commerce. While India's overall retail market shrank by 5% for the fiscal year ending March 2021, the nation's e-retail market notched 25% growth despite a two-month national lockdown.</p><p>Amazon and Walmart will have to fight harder in India and accept a harsher business environment as the new normal, as most technology firms have globally -- because the scale of the opportunity is simply too large to ignore.</p><p>The latest measures by the government, though an inconvenience, are unlikely to change that fundamental calculus.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
