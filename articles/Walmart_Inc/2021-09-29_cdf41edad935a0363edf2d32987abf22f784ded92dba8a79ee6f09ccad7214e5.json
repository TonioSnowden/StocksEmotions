  "text": "<p>   The Sept. 24 op-ed by Faith Bottum (\"Old Veterans Organizations Are Fading Away\") is eerily similar to another Journal article: \"American Legion, Once Civic and Social Power is Slowly Fading Away\" by reporter P.F. Kluge. \"The old members are dying off and the young ones aren't interested,\" says a veteran quoted in Mr. Kluge's piece. \"Younger veterans simply don't join clubs the way older generations did,\" writes Ms. Bottum. </p><p>   I must have been one of the veterans that Mr. Kluge believed wasn't interested. You see, his piece was published on May 19, 1971. More than 50 years later, the American Legion is still here and it is still the largest veterans organization in the country. </p><p>   In recent years, the American Legion has been the lead organization responsible for the passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the VA Mission Act and the Veteran Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act. In fiscal year 2020, our corps of more than 3,000 service officers and representatives across the nation was responsible for obtaining more than $14.25 billion in compensation benefits earned by veterans and their families. </p><p>   The 2016 Democratic and Republican nominees for president must not have believed we were fading away when they both chose to attend our national convention and address our delegates in the middle of a busy campaign season. </p><p>   There are more than twice as many American Legion posts in the U.S. today as there are Walmarts. The Journal was wrong 50 years ago and is off base today. </p><p>   Paul E. Dillard </p><p>   Indianapolis </p><p>   Mr. Dillard is national commander of the American Legion. </p><p></p>",
