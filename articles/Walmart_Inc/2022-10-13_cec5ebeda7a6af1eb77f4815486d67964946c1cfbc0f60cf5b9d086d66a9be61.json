  "text": "<p>Joe Biden has warned that the US faces a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9011130-a119-40d5-beb9-a09e7faff2e1\">“decisive decade” in its rivalry with China</a>, as he unveiled a national security strategy that singled out Beijing as having the intent and capability to reshape the world order.</p> <p>In the first such document of his presidency, Biden wrote yesterday that his administration was “clear-eyed about the scope and seriousness” of the challenge that China and Russia posed to the international order.</p> <p>“China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit,” Biden wrote.</p> <p>Speaking about the strategy, national security adviser Jake Sullivan described China as the “most consequential geopolitical challenge”. The document said that while Russia posed an “immediate and ongoing” threat, it “lacks the across the spectrum capabilities of the [People's Republic of China]”.</p> <p>The focus on China comes as relations between Washington and Beijing are in their worst state since the nations established diplomatic relations in 1979. The US is concerned about the rapid modernisation of China's military and its aggressive activity around Taiwan.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Fed fearful of doing ‘too little' on inflation </strong>Federal Reserve officials are more concerned about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb80edad-f833-45ab-b945-2e9b6fbe400a\">doing too little to rein in soaring inflation</a> than too much, according to an account of their September meeting, at which a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate rise was implemented. Fed officials have come under international pressure to slow the pace of rate rises given their impact on the ability of countries with weaker public finances to repay their debts. Central bankers remain committed to tightening monetary policy, according to the account.</p> <p><strong>2. Alex Jones ordered to pay nearly $1bn over Sandy Hook claims </strong>A Connecticut jury has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c18cee4b-e7cc-47de-8d57-dcd929e30216\">ordered Alex Jones</a> to pay nearly $1bn in damages to the families of Sandy Hook victims as a result of his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Jones has falsely claimed that the massacre, in which 20 children and six teachers were killed, was a plot staged by anti-gun activists and that victims' families were actually actors. Jones was ordered yesterday to pay a total of $965mn in damages to the families of eight victims and an FBI agent who responded to the shooting.</p> <p><strong>3. CPI expected to have slowed only slightly in September </strong>The US consumer price index is expected to have risen at only a slightly slower pace in September, growing by 8.1 per cent compared with the same month last year, just below the 8.3 per cent annual rise recorded in August, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a8f934-ee38-4d8e-b56e-5a27b7bb8f62\">according to forecasts from economists polled by Reuters</a>. The forecast cements criticism that the Biden administration has failed to meaningfully bring down inflation before the November midterm elections.</p> <p><strong>4. Saudi Arabia defends oil cuts</strong> The Saudi Arabian government said that the Opec+ <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5eaea58f-d04f-40d6-aae5-f0b39ab324c0\">decision to slash oil supply was taken unanimously by the cartel</a> and was not influenced by the kingdom's stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The foreign ministry also suggested that the Biden administration had asked the kingdom to delay oil cuts by a month, reducing the impact of any surge in prices until after the midterm elections. Today's comments come after Biden warned that Saudi Arabia would face “consequences” for its decision.</p> <p><strong>5. Starlink terminals back online in Ukraine </strong>Internet devices made by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which are used to communicate on the battlefield and had suffered outages, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29ed76b9-d6bf-428c-8673-af48b7ed70df\">have come back online</a> in the past few days, Ukrainian soldiers and officials said, restoring lines of communications in territory liberated from Russian occupation.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Military briefing: </strong>Russia is pressing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b85b384-a9aa-4f16-be25-7d7ee4d6bb32\">Belarus to open a front</a> in the war, which could force Kyiv to divert attention from its counteroffensives in the east and south.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>In oil:</strong> Sri Lanka has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59e4ff01-f8eb-4ba1-95e9-bcaa76bcbb10\">begun importing large quantities</a> of Russian oil, as cash-strapped countries take advantage of price discounts created by sanctions.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas. Now, here is the rest of today's news — Abby</em></p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Inflation </strong>Today's inflation reading will be the last one before the US midterm elections in November, and will highlight the Biden administration's inability to meaningfully tame inflation thus far. </p> <p><strong>January 6 committee </strong>The congressional committee investigating the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol will hold what is likely to be its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95ee40c1-110c-4b25-bf00-8518a6d9d650\">final public hearing today.</a> The committee is expected to present secret service emails and new video footage aides have said will highlight Donald Trump's role in the violence. The proceeding was originally scheduled for late September, but was delayed because of Hurricane Ian.</p> <p><strong>Earnings </strong>BlackRock and Delta Air Lines will headline US earnings to be reported before the opening bell. The asset management giant is expected to report a fall in earnings to $6.87 a share, as volatile market conditions hit investment portfolios. BlackRock's assets under management are expected to be down about 12.4 per cent from a year ago at $8.29tn. Meanwhile, investors will be looking for signs from Delta as to whether demand for air travel will remain elevated. The carrier is expected to report revenue of $12.9bn, above pre-pandemic levels, although earnings are forecast to fall about 14 per cent from a year ago to $1.62 a share. Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance and Domino's Pizza will also report earnings.</p> <p><strong>US jobs </strong>New claims for unemployment aid are expected to increase for the second straight week, as the labour market has started sending signals that the economy is cooling. Economists polled by Refinitv predict jobless claims of 225,000 for the week ending October 8, up from 216,000 the prior week. Data reported by the labour department last Friday showed that although the unemployment rate returned to its pre-pandemic low of 3.5 per cent in September, jobs growth cooled.</p> <p><strong>World Bank </strong>World Bank president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f067fccd-0a8c-4471-8752-5d29c9d88fd0\">David Malpass</a> will hold a press conference at the joint annual meetings between the bank and the International Monetary Fund, which enter their fourth day.
