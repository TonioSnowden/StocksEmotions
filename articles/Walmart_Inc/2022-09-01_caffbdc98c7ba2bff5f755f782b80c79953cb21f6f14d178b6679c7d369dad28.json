  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, executives and directors attempted to assuage its uneasy partners. In a business update, they said the company secured commitments for more than $500 million in financing and could potentially sell as many as 12 million shares of common stock to raise money. They pledged to overhaul the assortment of goods in the company's stores, focusing more on national brands after spending millions of dollars to develop private-label goods.</p><p>\"While there is much work ahead, our road map is clear and we're confident that the significant changes we've announced today will have a positive impact on our performance,\" said Sue Gove, a board member who is serving as interim chief executive.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock was off 21% in Wednesday trading, as the plan to sell shares could dilute the holdings of existing shareholders. The stock, a favorite among meme investors, lost more than half its value over the past two weeks. As of Wednesday, the company's market value was about $750 million. At its peak in June 2012, it had a valuation of more than $17.3 billion, according to FactSet data.</p><p>The retailer said it would lay off about 20% of its corporate and supply-chain staffers and that it eliminated its operating- and stores-chief positions. It will close about 150 of the roughly 770 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores, including about 50 to 60 in the first wave, finance chief Gustavo Arnal said during a conference call.</p><p>Founded more than 50 years ago, the Union, N.J., company had several decades of rapid growth as it became known for its big-box stores stockpiled with merchandise and its coupons. In recent years, it wrestled with falling sales and shifting strategies.</p><p>In 2019, activist investors ousted the chain's founders and revamped the board, saying its leaders failed to modernize the stores and capitalize on the rise of e-commerce.</p><p>Mark Tritton, a former Target Corp. executive, joined the company in 2019 and sought to turn around the retailer by pushing deeper into private-label brands, among other initiatives. Those brands weren't well-received by shoppers and were hindered by pandemic-related supply-chain constraints.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's board ousted Mr. Tritton in June and installed Ms. Gove, a retail-restructuring consultant, as interim CEO. The company is working to find a permanent CEO and said Wednesday that the search process is continuing.</p><p>The retailer received another blow in August when billionaire activist Ryan Cohen sold his 10% stake in the company, about six months after acquiring his shares. The company's stock, which had been rallying in previous weeks, slid after individuals followed Mr. Cohen in selling shares.</p><p>The business update came just days after the end of the company's latest quarter, which showed the issues facing the retail chain. Comparable sales -- reflecting sales at stores open at least a year -- fell 26% in the quarter ended Aug. 27. The company's operations burned through about $325 million of its cash reserves during the period.</p><p>While the company plans to release its second-quarter report on Sept. 29, preliminary results show the money it is bringing in the door is leaving quickly. And the new financing provides only a short runway for the turnaround, analysts said. The more than $500 million infusion, led by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and asset manager Sixth Street Partners, includes $375 million from a new loan and the expansion of a credit line.</p><p>The new arrangement will reduce the debt exposure of the JPMorgan credit line by more than half while Bed Bath &amp; Beyond retains access to about $800 million in borrowing capacity. The company said it ended the latest quarter with about $200 million in cash and investments. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment.</p><p>Compounding matters is a glut of inventory that is bedeviling a number of retailers.</p><p>Walmart Inc., Target and other chains are turning to discounts to move inventory such as home goods and make room for holiday items, meaning competition is heavy for the bedding, small kitchen appliances and other items that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sells. Ms. Gove said the company is aiming to be \"the category retailer of choice\" in the home and baby market.</p><p>The company said it would discontinue three of its nine house brands and refocus more of its inventory on more established brands such as Calphalon, Cuisinart and Oxo.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would host a supplier event early this fall to boost the relationships it has with vendors.</p><p>Some of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's suppliers have started negotiating terms to get paid faster after they struggled to secure insurance against their merchandise sent to the retailer, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>",
