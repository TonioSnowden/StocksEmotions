  "text": "<p>Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department said, suggesting consumers—a prime driver of the economy—weren't put off buying by rising inflation. Also pointing to strong levels of spending heading into the holiday season, Walmart and Home Depot reported higher sales.</p><p>Worries about inflation have sapped markets of the momentum that propelled stocks to records earlier in the fall. Investors are preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by next summer to check the pace of consumer-price growth, which is running at a three-decade high. Higher rates could knock stocks and other riskier assets that have benefited from 18 months of monetary stimulus.</p><p>\"We're moving toward a period now of maybe a bit more volatility,\" said Frank Øland Winther, global chief strategist at Danske Bank, pointing to Covid-19 cases in Europe, trouble in China's property sector and inflation in the U.S. as potential challenges for the market. \"The returns we have seen this year so far just cannot continue.\"</p><p>Tuesday's retail data boosted yields on government bonds, adding to a recent advance. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which move in the opposite direction to the price of the bonds, rose to 1.630% Tuesday from 1.621% Monday.</p><p>In one sign that riskier assets are losing momentum, cryptocurrencies retreated. Bitcoin briefly fell below $59,000, its lowest price in November. Investors pointed to the stronger dollar as a catalyst for the fall.</p><p>The decline hit stocks in the crypto industry. Bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase Global fell 3% premarket and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital slid 5.6%.</p><p>Energy markets were volatile. European natural gas prices jumped almost 10% after German regulators suspended the certification process for a new pipeline linking Russia to Germany. Traders had hoped that Nord Stream 2, which is completed but not operational, would start to send gas toward Western Europe in the coming months.</p><p>Gold prices rose 0.4% to about $1,874 a troy ounce. The precious metal has rallied to five-month highs in a sign of growing unease about the inflation outlook.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. Gains for telecom and auto stocks pushed the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.2%. Vodafone Group rose more than 5% after the U.K. telecom company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Thyssenkrupp jumped 5.4% after a media report said the German conglomerate was looking to list its electrolysis unit.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.3%, Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1% and China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Little Changed as Retail Sales Grow</p>",
