  "title": "Biden Says No Union, No Contract; A new White House plan would steer federal funds toward Big Labor.",
  "text": "<p>The boldest discourage federal agencies from issuing contracts and grants to employers that don't show \"strong labor standards.\" For example, the report asks the Administration to create a \"job quality matrix\" to evaluate employers seeking federal funds. Once the metrics are adopted, federal agencies would use them to screen award recipients.</p><p>The kicker is that for the Biden Administration, a quality job means a union job. The report suggests that federal assistance \"cannot be used to deny workers the right to organize,\" but that's already true. In practice, the new policy could let the government discriminate against a company that has fought an effort to organize its workforce.</p><p>A bias toward unions in awarding contracts would run up against federal law. Companies have a First Amendment right to resist organization, and agencies can't hold that stance against them when disbursing funds. A federal judge in 2016 upheld this standard to block an executive order by President Obama, which would have required federal grantees to disclose any alleged labor violations publicly.</p><p>Yet the Biden Administration wants to dodge that precedent by claiming that resistance to unions is a material factor in companies' fitness. The report says union shops are favorable because collective-bargaining agreements \"promote stability and minimize disruption of services and goods procured.\" Never mind that the explicit goal of the proposals is \"increasing worker organizing.\" The Administration wants you to believe unionized firms are always the best contractors.</p><p>The policy change could be used against nonunion companies like Amazon and Walmart, along with countless small and midsize employers. It could also steer federal money toward Democratic-leaning states, many of which lack right-to-work laws and have more unionized companies.</p><p>This is a backdoor way of rewarding Big Labor, after pro-union legislation faltered in Congress. The House last March passed the PRO Act, which would have banned right to work in all 50 states and restricted companies from speaking against unions. But Democrats such as Arizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema denied the bill a Senate majority.</p><p>President Biden is free to sing union praises, and the parts of his agenda that concern federal workers fall within his authority. But voters, and perhaps the courts, should draw the line at bias in government funding. Shutting nonunion companies out of grants and contracts would reward Democrats' labor allies at the expense of taxpayers.</p><p>Biden Says No Union, No Contract</p>",
