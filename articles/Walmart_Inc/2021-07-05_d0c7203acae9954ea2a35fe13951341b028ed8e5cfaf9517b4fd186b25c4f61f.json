  "text": "<p>The UK's largest asset manager has warned that private equity firms must not be allowed to acquire Wm Morrison for the “wrong reasons”, such as profiting from the supermarket chain's property portfolio or “levering the company up with debt”.</p> <p>The outspoken comments from Legal &amp; General Investment Management, a top-10 shareholder in Morrisons, come during an unprecedented wave of private equity bid interest in UK companies that has sparked soul searching in the City of London.</p> <p>Andrew Koch, senior fund manager, said LGIM was speaking out “as responsible stewards of our clients' capital” after the supermarket agreed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd0219a-6acb-4e17-be9f-69c54c85e330\">£9.5bn takeover</a> led by Fortress and attracted bid interest from two other private equity firms, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice and Apollo.</p> <p>Investors needed more detailed figures about the current value of Morrisons' properties to “make a considered decision regarding the right future for the company”, said Koch. </p> <p>Morrisons' freehold land and buildings had a book value of £5.8bn, its accounts for the year to January show.&#xa0;</p> <p>Other institutional investors applauded the effect on the share price. Shares in the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain gained 11 per cent to 266.5p on Monday — comfortably above the Fortress offer, pitched at 252p a share, a sign that traders believe there will be another bid.</p> <p>Morrisons accepted the Fortress-led offer on Saturday after last month rejecting a 230p a share bid from Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Apollo, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8cfbc0e-aece-4a53-8d66-120503246b8e\">lost out</a> last year in a bidding battle for the Asda grocery chain, said on Monday that it was “in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer”.</p> <p>“I think the Morrisons deal is good value, I think it's a smart thing to do,” said Stephen Bird, chief executive of Abrdn, a top-30 shareholder whose stake is passive.</p> <p>“My view is that 254p undervalues Wm Morrison, but with three private equity groups interested it is unlikely to be the final bid,” another top-30 shareholder said. </p> <p>“We welcome a bidding war,” a third top-30 shareholder said. “There seems to be value in there and we can see this going to £3.”</p> <p>Morrisons, based in Bradford, said over the weekend that it had struck a £9.5bn deal with a consortium led by SoftBank-owned Fortress and including the Canadian pension fund CPPIB and a unit of Koch Industries.</p> <p>The accepted deal included a 2p-a-share special dividend and valued the equity of Morrisons at £6.3bn before the inclusion of £3.2bn of net debt. The deal remains subject to shareholder approval.</p> <p>Fortress and its allies made several public commitments about the future of Morrisons, which traces its roots back to a market stall opened in 1899. They said they planned to keep the company's headquarters in West Yorkshire, safeguard pensions and maintain a £10-an-hour minimum pay deal for staff.</p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson, Attracta Mooney, Kaye Wiggins and Alistair Gray  2021 'LGIM warns against private equity buying Morrisons for ‘wrong reasons'' FT.com 5 July.
