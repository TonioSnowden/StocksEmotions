  "text": "<p>A key component of the company's plan to \"better serve customers\" was the decision to keep its buybuy BABY store chain instead of selling it. After a \"comprehensive\" review of the banner's value and potential, the company has identified strategies to accelerate growth:</p><p>* Build on the banner's digital and registry platforms</p><p>* Address additional age groups</p><p>* Expand products and services</p><p>The company said its board of directors will continue to monitor the business, and indicated it could change its mind about selling the business.</p><p>Other moves to boost overall sales include \"adjusting merchandise allocations to lead with customer preference,\" which suggests the retailer will add inventory in products that have been selling better. The company said it would do this by bringing back popular national brands and introducing \"new, emerging\" direct-to-consumer brands.</p><p>\"The company is working expeditiously to increase its National Brands inventory where possible and will increase inventory penetration by 20 percentage points over the long term,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>Don't miss: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock extends plunge after strategic update details jobs cuts, share offering and sales warning.</p><p>The retailer also said it would exit three of its nine Owned Brands, as it discontinues its Haven, Wild Sage and Studio 3B labels. And for the six remaining labels — Simply Essential, Nestwell, Our Table, Squared Away, H for Happy and Everhome — inventory will be cut by one-fifth to improve the sales-to-stock ratio.</p><p>Right-sizing merchandising allocations will also include a reduced number of stores. The company said it has identified about 150 \"lower-producing\" Bed Bath &amp; Beyond banner stores that it plans to close. That represents about one-fifth of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond banner stores it operated as of Feb. 26, and about 16% of the total number of stores.</p><p>The company has also \"realigned\" its leadership team to reflect its new priorities. Mara Sirhal, who was chief merchandising officer, was appointed brand president of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, while Harmon General Manager Patty Wu was promoted to brand president of buybuy BABY.</p><p>Accordingly, the company said it has eliminated the chief operating officer and chief stores officer roles. John Hartmann had been COO and Gregg Melnick had been CSO.</p><p>In addressing customer engagement, the company said is plans to \"leverage\" its loyalty program, Welcome Rewards. The program, which was introduced in late June, has five million members.</p><p>Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem wasn't too impressed with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's new strategy to boost sales, as he reiterated his underweight ratingand said the retailer's stock needed to fall a lot further to reflect the company's prospects.</p><p>\"All in, we struggle to find a bull case in this; and while we believe BBBY's restructuring efforts and pivot away from owned brands likely makes sense, we see few reasons to believe [same-store sales]/margins can structurally improve from here; and thus, we view shares considerably overvalued at these levels,\" Fadem wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Fadem has a $3 stock price target on the stock, which implies about 69% downside from current levels.</p><p>And Joseph Acosta, a partner at Dorsey &amp; Whitney, said while Bed Bath &amp; Beyond may have great ideas, brands and product lines, it also has a lot of competition. The company said it would bring back better brands to help convince consumer shop at its stores, but Acosta noted that its competitors also sell those brands.</p><p>\"In an ever increasing competitive environment, BBBY has to convince people to shop with them rather than with others,\" Acosta said. \"Keep in mind that big box retail stores, like Target and Walmart, have proven to be dominant, and ecommerce, not just Amazon, has been steadily increasing its presence in the marketplace.\"</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock has dropped 65.7% over the past 12 months. In comparison, Target Corp.'s stock TGT has declined 34.9%, Walmart Inc. shares WMT have shed 10.3% and Amazon.com Inc. shares AMZN have slid 27.1%. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX has lost 12.6% in the past year.</p><p>Also read: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock on track for 2nd-best monthly performance in its 30-year history.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond going 'back-to-basics' to boost traffic and sales, with 'unique' assortment and 'newness'</p>",
