  "title": "Target Profit Rises as Annual Revenue Crosses $100 Billion; Retailer expects sales growth to slow in 2022",
  "text": "<p>The results came after its big-box retail peer Walmart Inc. recorded rising sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year and stronger profit in the holiday period.</p><p>For the full year, Target's revenue hit $106 billion, compared with $77.1 billion for the year ended Feb. 1, 2020, before the pandemic upended the global economy and consumer buying patterns.</p><p>Target has benefited from a surge in demand for home delivery and its service that allows customers to buy online and pick up in-store. Comparable sales during the most recent quarter rose by double-digit percentages across its five main categories of goods including food, apparel and home, the company said.</p><p>Overall profit rose nearly 12% to $1.54 billion, or $3.21 a share, in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Strong revenue growth helped offset higher supply-chain costs and spending on wages. Excluding one-time items, Target posted earnings of $3.19 a share, ahead of the $2.85 a share expected by analysts, according to FactSet.</p><p>Target shares rose more than 10% in premarket trading.</p><p>The most recent fiscal year provided bumper earnings and revenue for other retailers as well. Kohl's Corp. reported revenue of $19.4 billion, a nearly 22% increase over 2020 when store closures from the pandemic strained sales. The company touted its operating margin of 8.6%, which Chief Executive Michelle Gass said was reached two years earlier than planned.</p><p>Kohl's reported revenue of $6.5 billion for the holiday quarter, up 6% from the previous year, but below analyst expectations, as profit shrank 13% to $299 million.</p><p>Activist investor Macellum Advisors GP LLC, which has a roughly 5% stake in Kohl's, has urged the company to make changes to its board. Both Macellum and activist Engine Capital LP have called on the company to explore selling itself in recent months. Kohl's rejected a $9 billion offer from a consortium backed by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP in January.</p><p>Kohl's said Tuesday that it would double its quarterly dividend and buy back at least $1 billion of its stock this year. The company expects net sales to rise 2% to 3% in fiscal 2022.</p><p>Meanwhile, Target expects revenue and adjusted earnings per share to increase this year at a slower pace than 2021.</p><p>On Monday, Target said it plans to raise wages this year, offering hourly workers a starting wage of $15 to $24 an hour.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com and Charity L.
