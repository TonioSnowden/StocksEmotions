  "title": "U.S.-Canada Border Restrictions: What to Know About Crossing Requirements; Fully vaccinated tourists can now cross the border in both directions",
  "text": "<p>The U.S. started on Nov. 8 to allow fully vaccinated foreign nationals to cross the land borders from Canada and Mexico for nonessential purposes. The U.S. and Canada are keeping their shared border open while the two countries impose new rules to address worries over the Covid-19 Omicron variant.</p><p>The State Department updated its travel advisory for Canada this week with a \"Do Not Travel\" warning, citing a sharp increase in the rise of Covid-19 cases in the country fueled by the Omicron variant. \"Even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an accompanying note.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ruled out closing the country's borders to contain the spread of the Omicron variant, saying such a move would be ineffective. Canada lifted a ban on Dec. 17 affecting travel into Canada from 10 African countries, among them South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first identified.</p><p>Can U.S. citizens visit Canada now?</p><p>If you are a fully vaccinated American citizen or a green-card holder living in the U.S., the answer is likely yes. As of Aug. 9, fully vaccinated Americans who meet other Canadian government criteria began to be allowed to enter Canada for nonessential purposes such as tourism and recreation.</p><p>Fully vaccinated tourists from other countries also gained the right to enter Canada as of Sept. 7, as long as they meet all of the government's Covid-19 travel requirements and, depending on their citizenship, have a valid visa or electronic travel authorization.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Planning to travel to Canada? Share your stories with us by joining the conversation below.</p><p>Travelers need to wait at least two weeks after their last vaccine dose before crossing the border, and they must present proof of an approved, negative Covid-19 test taken during 72 hours before their arrival in Canada. They also can't have any symptoms of the disease when they arrive at the border.</p><p>Data covering October indicate 488,000 Americans traveled into Canada, or roughly a quarter the level set in October, 2019, or before the pandemic.</p><p>Canada also allows its own citizens or permanent residents to enter the country, and essential workers—most notably truck drivers—have been allowed to cross the border throughout the pandemic, as both countries agreed that trade of goods and services wouldn't be affected. As of Jan. 15, Canada requires essential workers, professional athletes and others previously exempt from public-health orders to be fully vaccinated for Covid-19 to gain entry. The U.S. imposed similar measures on Jan. 22.</p><p>Do I need to be fully vaccinated to cross the border?</p><p>If you're traveling for nonessential reasons, such as tourism or to visit a property in Canada, you need to be fully vaccinated with an accepted Covid-19 vaccine or a combination of two different accepted vaccines. Canada accepts Covid-19 vaccines authorized by its regulator, from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca PLC. Canada also accepts vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, thereby adding China-made Sinopharm and Sinovac, and Covaxin from India.</p><p>Fully vaccinated tourists are permitted to bring unvaccinated children under 12 years of age to Canada, although those children won't be allowed in group settings like schools, camps or daycare centers for 14 days after their arrival. They also aren't allowed to attend large crowded indoor and outdoor settings like amusement parks or sports events during that period.</p><p>Children ages 5 to 12 will have to take Covid-19 tests before their arrival, when they get to Canada, and on their eighth day in the country.</p><p>Children ages 12 to 17 who aren't fully vaccinated and are traveling with their vaccinated parents or guardians are subject to the same testing requirements as younger children. They are also required to quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival in Canada.</p><p>What documents do I need to travel to Canada?</p><p>Travelers need to upload proof of their vaccination and other information to a Canadian government app or website called ArriveCAN before they board a flight or reach a land crossing, and carry a paper or digital copy of their proof of vaccination with them. Those who meet all the government's requirements won't have to quarantine, although officials said everyone is expected to have a quarantine plan in case a border official determines they don't meet all requirements.</p><p>Proof of a negative Covid-19 test is also a requirement and must be administered during the 72 hours before a scheduled flight to Canada or arrival at the land border. Canada generally accepts molecular Covid-19 tests, which look for the virus's genetic material, such as polymerase chain-reaction tests. It doesn't accept antigen tests, which look for viral proteins. A previous, positive test result taken between 14 and 180 days before a person's departure for Canada is also acceptable.</p><p>Randomly selected travelers may also be required to take a Covid-19 test upon their arrival in Canada.</p><p>What are the current Covid-19 restrictions in Canada?</p><p>Canadian regional authorities have stepped up restrictions in light of concerns over the Omicron variant. Canada's two most-populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, ordered restaurants, bars, and gyms shut down, although Ontario has said those businesses will be allowed to reopen at 50% capacity starting Jan. 31. Retail outlets also face capacity limits. Meanwhile, most provinces now require proof of vaccination to enter certain public settings, such as restaurants and gyms. In Quebec, proof of vaccination is required to enter province-owned liquor and cannabis stores, and big-box retail outlets like those operated by Walmart Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. Anyone who wants to board either a plane or a long-haul passenger train in Canada—for domestic or international travel—must be fully vaccinated.</p><p>What is the Covid-19 situation like in Canada?</p><p>Canada recorded a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases starting in early December due to transmission of the Omicron variant. The country's seven-day average on an adjusted basis has declined from a recent high, although authorities acknowledge the actual number is likely underreported because of a lack of testing capacity. The number of Covid-infected patients admitted to hospitals and now occupying intensive-care unit beds have both increased steeply in recent weeks. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public-health officer, said on Jan. 21 that there are early indications that infections tied to Omicron may have peaked at the national level.</p><p>Over 78% of Canadians were fully vaccinated as of Jan. 25, compared with 63% of Americans. Among the Group of Seven economies, Japan and Canada lead in terms of the share of their population with two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. When it comes to administering Covid-19 booster doses, Canada has surpassed the U.S. but trails most of its other G-7 peers, according to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data. Canadian authorities say a booster dose will be required to provide a reasonable level of protection against the Omicron variant.</p><p>What happens when I go back to the U.S.?</p><p>Fully vaccinated Americans flying back to the U.S. will need to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test administered within 24 hours before arrival. Documentation of a recent recovery from Covid-19 is also acceptable. Those driving back across the land border aren't required to show proof of a negative test result.</p><p>If you develop symptoms of Covid-19 or test positive for the disease, you are expected to self-isolate and delay any travel until you have recovered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Airlines aren't allowed to let travelers board if they don't have proof of a negative test result or documentation of a recent recovery from Covid-19.</p><p>Can Canadians enter the U.S.?</p><p>The U.S. started on Nov. 8 to allow foreign nationals to cross the land border from Canada and Mexico for nonessential purposes such as shopping or visiting family and friends.</p><p>At the time, business groups in Canada and the U.S. welcomed the announcement. \"Safely lifting these travel bans will help struggling communities get back on their feet,\" said John Baselice, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's vice president of immigration policy.</p><p>Senior officials with the Biden administration said the new rules were meant to bring the land borders into harmony with a requirement that international travelers arriving in the U.S. by air be fully vaccinated beginning in November.</p><p>Canadians can continue to fly into the U.S. with proof of a negative Covid-19 test administered 24 hours before arrival. They also need to be fully vaccinated. Canadians are required to produce a negative molecular Covid-19 test to re-enter their country.</p><p>The U.S. will further amend its border rules in January, officials said. At that time, foreign nationals entering the country for essential purposes —such as attending school or trucking goods across the border—will also have to be fully vaccinated.</p><p>U.S. officials said on Oct. 12 that they were still working out what documentation might be required at the land border. They said people crossing the border would be asked about their vaccination status by an officer, who would have the discretion to send a traveler to secondary screening to have their documents checked.</p><p>On Oct. 15, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Canadian residents and other travelers who have any combination of two doses of an FDA approved or authorized Covid-19 vaccine, or vaccines approved by the World Health Organization such as from AstraZeneca PLC, are considered fully vaccinated. Many Canadians mixed vaccine types, per recommendations from regional health authorities.</p><p>Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com</p><p>U.S.-Canada Border Restrictions: What to Know About Crossing Requirements</p>",
