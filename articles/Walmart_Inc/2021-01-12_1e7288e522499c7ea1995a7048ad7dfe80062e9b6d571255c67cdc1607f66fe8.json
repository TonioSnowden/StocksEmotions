Yet the company at the centre of one of this year's first and potentially largest UK private equity takeover battles is a private jet services company.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FTSE 250-listed <strong>Signature Aviation</strong>, which runs a network of refuelling and maintenance bases for private planes, said on Monday it had reached an agreement on a £3.4bn bid from <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong>, the New York-based group founded by former <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> banker <strong>Adebayo Ogunlesi</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But that may not be the end of the story. Signature, chaired by the British industrialist <strong>Sir Nigel Rudd</strong>, kept its options open by issuing a clear message to rival bidders.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Nothing precludes either <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Cascade</strong> or <strong>Carlyle</strong> from making an offer proposal that the board of Signature Aviation will consider,” Signature said as it announced the GIP agreement. (Sir Nigel, who chaired <strong>Boots</strong> when it agreed to its £11bn take-private deal with <strong>KKR</strong> in 2007, is no stranger to selling to private equity.)&#xa0;</p> <p>Read the story by DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Philip Georgiadis <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e35c9245-dd4d-4fea-a640-3b69faf76705\">here</a>.</p> <p>Cascade, which manages <strong>Bill Gates</strong>' fortune, is Signature's largest shareholder, with a 19 per cent stake. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b21f3f3-e5f7-4655-a3c6-64ba8cce035a\">Last week</a> it teamed up with private equity group Blackstone, which had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0e273ba-117f-4586-9d1f-696114e3bc38\">already held talks</a> with Signature about a possible £3bn offer, saying they might make a joint bid. Rival buyout group Carlyle has also expressed interest in a possible bid.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cascade has said that if it and Blackstone were to make a firm offer — which they haven't yet done — it would vote against any competing proposal. That would be a serious hurdle for GIP, whose offer is structured as a scheme of arrangement and so would need the support of 75 per cent of shareholders.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cue some mathematical gyrations on all sides about the chances of any deal being struck without Cascade's support.&#xa0;</p> <p>The upshot: it's tough but not impossible. One option would be for GIP to switch to a contractual takeover offer, for which it would need backing from just over 50 per cent of shareholders.&#xa0;</p> <p>That could leave GIP holding a majority stake in a listed company if it won more than 50 per cent but didn't get the 75 per cent needed to de-list Signature. It could also prove tricky for Cascade, since if GIP won over enough shareholders to de-list Signature, Cascade may be left with an illiquid minority stake in a private company.</p> <p>Another option for GIP: hope that Bill Gates, who's already come under fire <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9128203/Bill-Gates-bids-private-jet-operator-one-month-releases-climate-change-book.html\">in the British media</a> for considering a private jets deal as he's about to publish a book called <em>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster</em>, decides it's not a good look to try to stop other shareholders from getting a higher payout from any rival GIP or Carlyle bid.&#xa0;</p> <p>All of that, of course, only kicks in if Blackstone is willing to raise its bid from a possible offer of $5.17 a share to one beating GIP's $5.50 bid — which would be a significant increase.&#xa0;</p> <p>Blackstone's thesis rests in part on soaring demand for private flights as the rich shun commercial journeys amid the pandemic (Signature's biggest customer,<strong> Warren Buffett</strong>-owned <strong>NetJets</strong>, is enticing new passengers through a shared ownership model, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc01217f-de86-4089-8924-7f8928fb794a\">Lex</a> notes).</p> <p>Blackstone's next move will show how strongly it backs its rationale.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Third time's the charm? Staples moves on Office Depot yet again&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Staples</strong> is not a company easily deterred.&#xa0;</p> <p>Five years after its $6.3bn attempt to buy <strong>Office Depot </strong>was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8c72832-170d-11e6-b8d5-4c1fcdbe169f\">thwarted by antitrust concerns</a>, the office stationery chain is again trying to ink a deal with a company it has been pursuing for more than two decades.</p> <p>But much has changed for Staples (and OD) since its unsuccessful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a002d0bc-ac74-11e4-9aaa-00144feab7de\">bid in 2015</a>. Shortly after a federal judge ruled that the deal could not go through due to concerns over competition, private equity group <strong>Sycamore Partners</strong> swooped in to take Staples private in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3371c54-f4fb-3420-a57f-2f9f1a7db519\">$7bn deal</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sycamore, a feared investor known for its financial mastery (read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fa945ae-5995-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a\">the piece</a> by DD's Sujeet Indap for more on this), decided to split Staples into two divisions — an office supply unit and a store chain. The structure essentially made it easier for the firm to finance the buyout with debt.&#xa0;</p> <p>Just two years later, Sycamore pulled off a feat that would make most private equity firms envious. It took $1bn out of Staples in a $5.4bn refinancing deal. The move was seen as bold, even for an industry that routinely extracts money from the businesses it buys.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now that we've covered how things have changed for Staples, what does that mean for its third attempt — it also made an offer in 1997 — to buy OD?</p> <p>Staples has offered to make a key concession: ie, divesting some of OD's divisions. One option would be <strong>CompuCom</strong>, the business OD acquired in late 2017 for $1bn, or its commercial division.&#xa0;</p> <p>Antitrust officials will also have to consider <strong>Amazon</strong>. Its swiftly growing corporate customer base, coupled with the encroachment of <strong>Walmart </strong>and other discount chains on to the office suppliers' territory, has endangered Staples and OD's chances of survival.</p> <p>Not to mention the massive shift to work-from-home set-ups, which has reduced demand for paper, printer ink and other dusty artefacts of fluorescently-lit corporate digs.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's still early stages. Staples sent the letter to OD's board on Monday and received a muted (public) response in which OD said it was “carefully reviewing” the proposal, making note of the potential regulatory hurdles that remained ahead.</p> <p>But if OD were to accept the offer, which at $40 a share indicates a 60 per cent premium to its stock price over the past 90 days, it's the Biden administration that would be making a decision on its merits.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even if things don't go Staples' way, one thing seems clear — it's not one to cry over spilled ink.&#xa0;</p> <h2>European telecom towers: consolidation calling</h2> <p>Spanish telecoms infrastructure group <strong>Cellnex</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a48d7767-32e5-4e49-a7fe-c4a3b5fd310a\">closed</a> its €10bn acquisition of<strong> CK Hutchison</strong>'s European towers business on Monday, the latest in an industry wide dealmaking flurry.</p> <p>Coincidentally, <strong>Vodafone</strong> announced on Monday that it had folded its share of UK masts company<strong> Cornerstone </strong>into its soon-to-be-listed tower company <strong>Vantage</strong>.</p> <p>With the newly injected assets from Cornerstone, Vantage will boast one of the largest tower portfolios in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39453321-ef11-4306-b43a-5e7245c73324\">Lex points out</a>, emerging as the main competitor to Cellnex in the consolidation of Europe's passive telecoms infrastructure.</p> <p>Cellnex's rise from an obscure wing of Spanish toll road company <strong>Abertis</strong> to a company capable of spending €10bn via a mix of equity and debt only five years after listing is remarkable.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company's strategy to outbid rivals for a foothold in a market, or with an international operator like <strong>Iliad</strong>, before rapidly consolidating the rest of the market, has created a “domino effect” of deals.</p> <p>But what next for Cellnex, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a48d7767-32e5-4e49-a7fe-c4a3b5fd310a\">the M&amp;A machine</a> as one banker called it, as the low hanging tower fruit starts to disappear?</p> <p>It could start to target fibre and “edge computing” services, but bankers wonder whether the Spanish company will turn from predator to prey as giants like <strong>American Tower</strong> look more closely at Europe.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p>We've received a flood of job moves over the break.
