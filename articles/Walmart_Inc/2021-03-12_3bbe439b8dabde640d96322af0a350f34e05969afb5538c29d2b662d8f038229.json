  "text": "<p>(Random House, 274 pages, $28)</p><p>America's eating habits have changed radically over the past 40 years. We consume more and more food of less and less nutritional value. The nation's adult obesity rate is now 42.4%.</p><p>Why have our habits changed? Part of the reason is demographic. When women moved into the workplace, for instance, there was less time at home to devote to cooking. The result has been more eating out or store-bought prepared meals. Technology has played a role, too: The microwave oven gave birth to an industry of highly processed foods larded with fats and oils.</p><p>In \"Hooked,\" Michael Moss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of \"Salt Sugar Fat\" (2013), proposes a more sinister theory. What if the foods we're scarfing down have been designed and marketed to become addictive? While presenting his case, Mr. Moss offers a gripping, if incomplete, tour of America's food landscape, taking side trips into biology and psychology and, not least, into the world of corporate food conglomerates.</p><p>Mr. Moss begins with the science of addiction. A skilled storyteller, he talks to an array of experts and cites surprising facts -- for instance, 17% of those who try cocaine, and 15% who try alcohol, become addicted. The definition of addiction he likes best -- \"a repetitive behavior that some people find difficult to quit\" -- comes from a one-time chief executive of Philip Morris.</p><p>As for the biology that affects our food choices, Mr. Moss notes that, while it takes 10 seconds for the brain to feel the effects of cigarettes, sugar's effects are felt 20 times faster -- and salt and fat don't take much longer than that. The disparity stems from nicotine needing to enter the bloodstream to reach the brain, while sugar and salt take a shortcut through the taste buds. But the tongue is outmatched by the nose when it comes to driving our eating decisions. While there are 10,000 taste buds, there are 10 million olfactory receptors, and they can detect hundreds of scents. \"Flavor is the combination of taste and smell,\" writes Mr. Moss, \"and the lion's share of the credit in this goes to smell.\"</p><p>Of all the substances that can get us hooked, Mr. Moss says, \"nothing is faster than food when it comes to stirring up the brain. Certain kinds of food, that is.\" Those foods are the highly processed and sweetened concoctions that dominate the American diet: cereals, sodas, fruit juices, cookies, packaged meats, as well as the many condiments (like salad dressings and pasta sauces) that are packed with sodium and sugar. Consuming these items delivers intense and immediate pleasure and creates a need that fits Mr. Moss's broad definition of addiction.</p><p>Why are we only now seeing the harmful effects of our brain chemistry? Mr. Moss summarizes the thinking of one of the scientists he profiles: \"We simply haven't had anywhere near the time we would need, vis-a-vis evolution, to catch up with the dramatic changes in food and our eating habits of the past forty years.\" We are, Mr. Moss says, \"mismatched to the food of today.\"</p><p>One major theme of \"Hooked\" is that the food industry exploits this mismatch -- even creates it. Mr. Moss argues that the industry's growth has been enabled by its \"manipulation of our instinctual desires,\" not least through marketing and sales strategies. He describes companies super-sizing their products (such as the \"Double Stuf\" Oreo) and creating packaging that can remain upright (thus easing consumption while, say, driving). One byproduct of these strategies, observes Mr. Moss, is that snacks -- often processed products high in convenience but low in nutritional value -- now account for about 25% of daily calorie consumption. Social norms have adjusted themselves accordingly: It has become \"socially acceptable to eat anything, anywhere, anytime,\" Mr. Moss writes.</p><p>Some aspects of food consumerism are elementary: Shoppers love low prices, which is one reason that Walmart sells more groceries than any other store; and low prices, as welcome as they are, make it easy to overbuy, as Mr. Moss observes. Consumers also prize variety. Processed-food companies roll out small variations of existing products -- some labeled \"diet\" despite having virtually the same calorie count as their \"regular\" brethren.</p><p>Mr. Moss notes that as nutrition-less eating expanded our waistlines, food companies acquired low-calorie food lines (like Lean Cuisine) and diet franchises (such as Weight Watchers). It's as if \"Philip Morris had cornered the market on nicotine patches,\" he writes. He says that food companies lobby to keep nutrition labels practically meaningless to most Americans.</p><p>Mr. Moss identifies the problems across America's food culture, but his account would have benefited from a deeper exploration of counterarguments to his addiction thesis. He portrays individuals as having little or no capacity for reasoned judgment or for controlling their desires and replacing bad habits with good ones. It's an uncomfortable fact that many Americans recognize they're eating unhealthy food and continue to do so for reasons other than addiction. Mr. Moss briefly mentions research showing that only 15% of us meet the food-addict criteria.</p><p>It's not clear how best to encourage Americans to shed their extra pounds; nor is it clear what role large food companies should play in such an effort. But there is certainly a place for greater self-discipline. \"Hooked\" will help us move in that direction, by reminding us of the foods that can do us harm and illuminating the strategies by which they are being sold to us -- enticingly, relentlessly. Let's hope it doesn't take another 40 years to change our habits again.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Rees is editor of the Food and Health Facts newsletter and a senior fellow at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: The Sociology of That Addictive Junk Food\" -- WSJ Mar. 19, 2021)</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: An Unpopular Answer to the Mystery of American Obesity\" -- WSJ Mar. 27, 2021)</p>",
