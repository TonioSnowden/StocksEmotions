  "title": "Credit-Card 'Reform' Would Hurt Consumers; It would help Walmart and Target, though.",
  "text": "<p>If the Walmart-Target bill is passed, credit cards would be more vulnerable to fraud. Consumers who value and rely on credit-card rewards will either lose their benefits or see them hollowed out, with the loss of everything from cash back to airline travel. Millions of consumers will see their credit-card costs increase, while some could lose access to credit altogether, as the economics that support the current system are upended. The bill's purported carve out for smaller institutions won't work, which is why banks and credit unions of all sizes are united against it.</p><p>The article is clear about who will win if this legislation is passed, but readers deserve to know who will lose: small banks, credit unions and the millions of consumers they serve.</p><p>Jeff Tassey</p><p>Electronic Payments Coalition</p><p>Washington</p><p>Credit-Card 'Reform' Would Hurt Consumers</p>",
