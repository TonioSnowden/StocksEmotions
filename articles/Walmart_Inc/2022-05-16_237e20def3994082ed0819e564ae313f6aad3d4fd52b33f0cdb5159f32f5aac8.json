Their new baseline forecast assumes no recession, but if that happens, expect a drop to 3,600, they say.</p><p>\"Although S&amp;P 500 firms posted much better-than-expected 1Q EPS growth of 11%, investors have been mauled by a 18% near-bear market plunge since the index peaked on January 3rd,\" said chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin, in a note.</p><p>Their consolation prize and our call of the day is a list of 20 stocks with valuations below previous bear market lows.</p><p>Those companies also have size and liquidity — an above-average market cap is needed for uncertain times — and balance sheet strength, meaning they are typically less sensitive to an economic slowdown because they can withstand a fall in credit market liquidity, said Kostin and the team.</p><p>As for that attractive valuation, the metric is explained like this: the price/earnings multiple after a 20% haircut to expected 2023 earnings is below the forward p/e at the bottom of either or both of the March 2009 and March 2020 bear markets.</p><p>\"Importantly, given the different real interest rate environments, the highlighted stocks are more attractively valued today on a yield gap basis relative to the rest of the index than they were in either 2009 or 2020,\" said Kostin and the team.</p><p>And the stocks on this list, after a potential 20% reduction in 2023 EPS, would still have 2021-2023E compound annual growth earnings per share growth rate of 4% compared with -2% for the median S&amp;P 500 company.</p><p>Read: 'Nowhere to hide?'
