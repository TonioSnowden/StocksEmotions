  "title": "A Billionaire Explains Why He Bought Constitution",
  "text": "<p>To win the Constitution, he also had to outbid a group of more than 17,000 bidders who had organized online into a decentralized autonomous group, ConstitutionDAO. In a matter of days, this DAO raised more than $40 million specifically to buy the document from Sotheby's on Nov. 18.</p><p>\"It's very impressive how quickly the DAO raised $40 million to pursue buying the Constitution,\" Mr. Griffin said in an interview, \"but there were important questions about whether a large decentralized group would be able to manage the responsibilities necessary to protect this rare document.\"</p><p>Billionaires have long dominated the upper echelon of historic-documents collectors. Microsoft Corp.'s co-founder Bill Gates owns a $30.8 million copy of Leonardo da Vinci's scientific notebook known as the Codex Leicester. Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein owns a copy of the 1297 Magna Carta.</p><p>Mr. Griffin isn't named as the lender of the Constitution in the current museum exhibit, which also includes pieces by Jacob Lawrence and John Trumbull. But he is named as an overall exhibit sponsor, and he recently offered a rare window into the backstory of one of last year's most closely followed showdowns.</p><p>At the time of Sotheby's auction last November, soaring cryptocurrency markets were elevating collectors of digital art and investors with digital wealth into the rarified realm of blue-chip art collecting. The DAO's populist campaign to win the Constitution sparked a broader debate over whether cultural treasures should be owned by the many or the wealthiest few. Mr. Griffin's subsequent triumph also stood out because he was an outspoken critic of cryptocurrency at the time, a position he said he has since moderated because he recognizes there's a market for crypto.</p><p>Mr. Griffin said he started following the efforts by ConstitutionDAO in the days leading up to Sotheby's sale. A campaign that appeared to start on a whim escalated over several days, with some donors sending in as little as $200 apiece, typically in the form of cryptocurrency. Sotheby's high estimate for the document was only $20 million, so with $40 million collected by the time the sale started, it looked like the DAO was suddenly a shoo-in to win.</p><p>Mr. Griffin decided to step in. Because the group had divulged its maximum bid, he had an advantage during the bidding -- all he had to do was place one additional telephone bid to win. After eight minutes of competition, it was over. He'd won.</p><p>Among the riveted collectors sitting in Sotheby's saleroom was Olivia Walton, the niece of Walmart heiress Alice Walton who founded the Crystal Bridges museum over a decade ago. As soon as the sale ended, the younger Ms. Walton said she darted up to the specialist who had fielded the winning bid, Brooke Lampley. Ms. Walton said she told Ms. Lampley, \"You should tell whoever won that we'd put it on display if they want.\"</p><p>Later, Ms. Walton said she made the offer on impulse because the document is an \"obvious draw.\"</p><p>Mr. Griffin agreed. He said that standing in front of one of the only 13 surviving copies of the Constitution had proven to be a \"profoundly impactful moment\" for him. Five days after winning it, he also won at Sotheby's a $1.5 million copy of the \"Amendments to the Constitution of the United States,\" later ratified as the Bill of Rights. He lent that to the Arkansas museum as well.</p><p>The six-page, first edition of the Constitution, which starts out, \"We the people,\" was originally printed for delegates at the Constitutional Convention and for the Continental Congress more than 230 years ago. While at least 27 first printings of the Declaration of Independence survive, only 13 original copies of the Constitution are still around. Mr. Griffin won the last version still in private hands.</p><p>After the sale, he said he tried to acknowledge the effort of the ConstitutionDAO by having his team reach out to organizers to see if they wanted to co-fund any public display of the document. His team then offered to give the DAO a say, for no cost, in where it got shown half the time. Mr. Griffin said he even offered to issue \"an NFT for everyone who contributed as a symbol of what their community had accomplished together.\" The deal fizzled, he said.</p><p>Graham Novak, one of the DAO's founding members, said the DAO remembers the deal negotiations differently. Mr. Novak said Mr. Griffin offered to sell the digital rights to the document \"in exchange for an unspecified amount of the DAO's treasury. The proposal would leave Ken in control of the physical document,\" though, and he said the group wasn't aware of any free offer to get involved in where it would be displayed. Mr. Novak said the group decided that it couldn't redirect funds to anything other than buying the physical copy of the Constitution outright. \"That's what made this project special,\" he said.</p><p>In Arkansas, the exhibition positions the Constitution as the show's star. It sits in one of several shrine-like cases that also display Harlan Crow's copy of the 1777 Articles of Confederation and collector Mr. Rubenstein's Civil War-era copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment.</p><p>Mr. Griffin said he plans to attend before the show closes next Jan. 2.</p>",
