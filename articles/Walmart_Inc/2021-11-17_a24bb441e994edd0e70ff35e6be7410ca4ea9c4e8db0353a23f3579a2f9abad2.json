  "title": "Jessica Seinfeld on Being (Kinda, Sorta) Vegan; The cookbook author and philanthropist explains how she convinces her kids—and her husband, Jerry Seinfeld—to eat less meat and dairy.",
  "text": "<p>Seinfeld was raised the middle of three daughters in Oyster Bay, New York, and, later, Burlington, Vermont, by her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a victim services specialist. Both had long commutes to work, which meant she was often tasked with cooking duties. \"If we wanted to eat before 8 o'clock at night, I had to help [my mom] get dinner on the table. [She] would write little Post-its on things in the refrigerator before work that said, 'Heat this at 350 degrees for 45 minutes,' and we'd have baked ziti by the time she got home,\" she says. \"That's how I became really comfortable in the kitchen, which segued into cooking and working in kitchens and restaurants all through high school and college.\"</p><p>Seinfeld graduated from the University of Vermont in 1993 and moved to New York; she and her now husband, Jerry Seinfeld, met at a gym in 1998 and were married on Christmas Day, 1999. In 2001, she founded Baby Buggy, which was renamed the Good+Foundation in 2016, a New York–based nonprofit that provides essential items to needy families. The organization has donated over $75 million in children's items, like strollers, cribs and diapers, to families in need and to programs that combat poverty. Over the years, Good+ has evolved, broadening its focus to include new parent education programs and government policy aimed at dismantling multigenerational poverty. Seinfeld plans to complete an executive master of public administration in policy from New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service next year.</p><p>Seinfeld released her first cookbook, Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food, in 2007. The concept was simple: How could she sneak vegetables and other healthy foods into meals for her kids? (She is mom to Sascha, who is now 21, Julian, 18, and Shepherd, 16.) Following her appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show, the book became a No. 1 New York Times bestseller. Her latest book, which was created in collaboration with food stylist Sara Quessenberry, has a similar goal: How could she make vegan meals that seem non-vegan for her family? She has no problem with the fact that being deceptive with nutrition has been the secret to her culinary successes. \"We lie to our kids about the tooth fairy. We lie to our kids about Santa Claus,\" she says with a laugh.</p><p>Vegan, at Times was a Covid lockdown project for Seinfeld and Quessenberry. \"When workers at meat factories started to get really sick and couldn't take days off work and they were in these really close quarters together, I felt like the world was off its axis. Something is wrong here. That made me want to lean into this book hard,\" Seinfeld says. \"We can eat less meat in this country, I'm sure of it. I think people are worried they're not going to be satisfied with vegan meals. What [the food in this book] does is make you feel full, satisfied and like you're not sacrificing anything.\"</p><p>This September, Seinfeld turned 50, and recently contemplated whether or not she could have fathomed this life for herself. \"I never dreamed of getting married. I never dreamed of having kids. I never dreamed of having an organization that lasted 20 years. I never in my life thought I would have a cookbook. These are all things that happen by accident,\" she says. \"Wait, not my kids! They happened for a reason.\"</p><p>Derek Blasberg: Do you have any tips on how to be a vegan and not be annoying about it?</p><p>Jessica Seinfeld: I wrote a chapter on this in the book. Stop trying to tell people what to do. Don't should people. You should do this, you should do that. I keep [my vegan choices] to myself—except for this book, obviously.</p><p>DB: Are you a full-time vegan? Or, as the book title implies, are you a vegan at times?</p><p>JS: At times. Like many people, I have struggled to be a full-time vegan. Maybe it's something I'll be successful at one day, but for now I'm just trying to be somebody who reduces the amount of meat and dairy that I take in.</p><p>DB: Do you think that people who can't be full-time vegans should feel weak about it?</p><p>JS: No. I think there's this whole punitive aspect to veganism that turns people off and makes people feel like failures before they even begin. This idea that we can shame people into behavior modification, or becoming the way we want them to be by shaming them, is not an effective way of steering people toward a positive goal…. I'm not militant. I'm doing the best I can. I created a book for people that are also on that path but don't want to feel like a failure if they fall off one night. You want to have a piece of pizza with mozzarella cheese? OK, you can go back to [veganism] the next day or the next week or the next month.</p><p>DB: What's the easiest thing to prepare in this book?</p><p>JS: The first recipe is sweet oat crepes, which involves plant-based milk. It's the first for a reason, because anyone can do it. Sara and I shopped for [the ingredients] in this book at Target and Walmart and all those big-box stores to prove to ourselves that vegan food ingredients are accessible to all. This is not a fancy book. You don't need to go and get everything from Whole Foods.</p><p>DB: Who is your test audience for these recipes?</p><p>JS: The people in my audience range from age 67 to 16, and if there are leftovers, they are 10, 5, 4 and 4.</p><p>DB: That's Jerry and your kids, but who gets leftovers?</p><p>JS: Two dogs and my cats.</p><p>DB: What's your family's favorite dish?</p><p>JS: Jerry loves everything in this book. He's always really enthusiastic about these books, so sometimes I don't really know if it's real. But more importantly, my kids, who are really hard [to convince], now ask for the vegan macaroni and cheese.</p><p>DB: They ask for it unprovoked?</p><p>JS: Yes! I don't tell them when anything is vegan, I just give it to them. It's like what I did with my first book—</p><p>DB: Where you snuck in the veggies and didn't tell them?</p><p>JS: Yes, I didn't advertise there was broccoli shoved in their chicken nuggets. It's the same way with this book: I just give them things that are vegan and afterward ask, \"Did you know that was vegan?\" A couple of years ago, Sascha would ask me why everything I make has so many seeds in it. Now that she's in college and she's around much healthier eating with her peers, she's more open to healthy eating. Kids grow up and they become influenced by their friends as opposed to their mothers. That's been helpful.</p><p>DB: Sascha and Julian have left for college. How are you dealing with the onset of an empty nest?</p><p>JS: Shepherd says that sometimes it's great that he's alone and sometimes it's too much. Jerry and I both sit there in the morning and just stare at him while he's having breakfast. He's 16, and he wants to be on his phone. We are super annoying because that's what parents do. They annoy their children.</p><p>DB: You have two kids at Duke University, so annoying them must be an effective form of parenting.</p><p>JS: They've already far outdone us [academically]. They worked really hard. [Last year] I enrolled in graduate school because I was inspired by my own kids. When I was growing up, I had so much financial stress. [Now that] I see what you can do when [financial] scarcity is not an issue, I feel like I want to use my brain. I want to tap into what I know I didn't use in college. I have one more class to take and I'm done [with this degree], and then I'm going to go back and get another one. Academia is now my fetish.</p><p>DB: In Jerry's stand-ups, he sometimes uses his wife as comedic fodder. How does that make you feel?</p><p>JS: Hmm, how do I say this nicely? That's a version of me that is far more entertaining and funny. That person doesn't really exist. When we first got married and he started going on the road and making jokes about marriage, I was a little like, What? But now I'm like, \"Oh, you wish you were married to that person! You wish I was that fun and entertaining!\" He makes me into such a funnier person onstage than I probably am. But, if I am a tool for him, have at it.</p><p>DB: He once said that the first 10 years of a marriage are just training.</p><p>JS: Warm-up! He's lucky we survived those 10 years—but now he's made up for it. Now he's always around, he's always home.</p><p>DB: It must be impossible to fight with one of the funniest men in the world.</p><p>JS: Nope. I've mastered it! He's an incredible communicator. I could not talk to someone for 10 years and be OK with it, but he makes me talk. He makes me deal [with issues]. He's taught me a lot. He's made me such a better person, truly. He's an incredible father, too. Both of his parents are orphans. So, perhaps, he didn't grow up with this same kind of parenting that I did, and fatherhood for him wasn't a natural thing that he just came into when the kids were really young.</p><p>DB: This is a good way to segue into Good+, the organization you founded that now focuses on educating parents, especially fathers, on important tools for raising a family.</p><p>JS: Imagine that you've grown up around violence your whole life in a neighborhood where there are very few fathers. Imagine that for generations in your family fathers haven't been there. One of my mentors always says this about the myth of being a deadbeat dad: \"They're not deadbeats, they're dead broke.\" The fathers we work with are eager to be part of their children's lives, but we have systems in this country that are set up that ensure that they fail. After 20 years of working with families on their short-term needs and their long-term needs, I see the way parents are treated, I see the way fathers are treated. I really wanted to go back to school. I was so frustrated by the way the child welfare system works, by the way the child support system works in this country, that I just felt like…I just want to understand why nothing changes.</p><p>DB: Good+ just celebrated its 20th anniversary. Did you think when you started this it would become such a long-term commitment?</p><p>JS: It wasn't a long-range plan that I had. When I was in college, I worked at [a] probation and parole office, and I had a caseload of girls my own age. They were all mothers who had grown up in really tough circumstances. They would write bad checks or steal to feed their children or steal diapers to diaper their children…. When our first child was born, I wanted to do something immediately to express my gratitude and appreciation for not having financial stress…. After you have a kid, you're so emotional and you're so vulnerable, and you know how vulnerable your child is. I wanted to take care of other parents. We started as an organization that was giving stuff away to parents and became a policy-driving organization that's funded by some of the best foundations in the country. It's been far bigger than I could have ever dreamed it to be.</p><p>DB: Loaded question: What are your thoughts on social media?</p><p>JS: I have such a love-hate relationship with it. I'm fascinated by those people who feel entitled to weigh in. Somebody let me know today that she thought that my blurry edges [on the cooking videos she posts to her Instagram] were weird. I'm just trying to be a whisper of a person. I am providing you with free content. Inspiration. Cat stuff.</p><p>DB: And free recipes!</p><p>JS: If you don't like my blurry edges, there's 10,000 other people with crisper edges [on their cooking videos] who you might like better. Just go there. Why do you feel the need to weigh in?</p><p>DB: Do you respond to trolls?</p><p>JS: Sometimes, if I'm in a playful mood. I will spend 10 minutes, which is such a waste of time, thinking of a clever response.</p><p>DB: Some might argue that there's a catharsis to responding.</p><p>JS: I've had really interesting experiences where people have been really ugly toward me and I've engaged them and they have apologized. People who have said some of the most god-awful things that you can say to another human being, and I've been like, \"Are you OK? Do you really want to express yourself like this? So publicly? Let's talk.\" We DM back and forth, and I have ongoing relationships with them.</p><p>DB: So you've done the impossible: Flip people on social media.</p><p>JS: I'm interested in the psychology of someone crying out. Something happened. Something triggered you, and I want to know what it is. It's not about the blurry edges on my videos. What do I do that triggers you so much? It's not me, because you don't know me personally. I'm empathetic around that. I like to engage in that way.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
