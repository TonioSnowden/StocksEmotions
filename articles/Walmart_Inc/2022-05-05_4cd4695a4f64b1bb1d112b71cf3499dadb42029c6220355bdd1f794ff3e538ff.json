  "title": "Wayfair Loses Its Way; Online furniture seller is contending with tough conditions for both e-commerce and furniture sales",
  "text": "<p>The online furniture seller already was dealing with sales declines as consumers turned their attention from online shopping to in-person stores. Now, the company must also contend with slowing general demand for furnishings and other big-ticket items. In the first quarter, furniture sellers saw revenue grow 2.9% from a year earlier, a substantial slowdown from the 10%-plus year-over-year growth rate logged in the two preceding quarters, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Big-ticket items in general are a tougher sell these days; stores selling electronics and appliances actually recorded a 3.3% decline in the first quarter, even as sales at supermarkets and clothing stores grew at healthy paces of 9.1% and 16.7%, respectively.</p><p>Given the tough consumer backdrop, Wall Street analysts were anticipating bad news. Wayfair logged a 14% decline in revenue in the first quarter, mostly in line with the expectations of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Etsy, which reported its results Wednesday, said sales in the home-and-living category declined slightly.</p><p>The bigger surprise was a fall in the number of active customers. They declined about 7% from the preceding quarter; Wall Street had been expecting a modest rise. That marks the fourth consecutive quarter of declining active customer count. It also was the third consecutive quarter of net losses for the company, with rising fuel costs and new hiring activity hitting the bottom line. Wayfair stock fell 19% after its earnings call on Thursday morning.</p><p>The demand outlook is admittedly grim. Wayfair's Chief Executive Niraj Shah said on the earnings call that inflation and geopolitical uncertainty are driving consumers to shift spending to nondiscretionary purchases and to experiences such as travel. The company also said it can't commit to being profitable on a basis of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the full year.</p><p>The one bright spot for Wayfair relative to competition is the easing bottleneck in the supply chain. Mr. Shah said during the call that delivery times improved 10% for small parcels and 20% for large parcels in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. The tight supply situation was particularly tough on Wayfair, which doesn't take on inventory risk. When supply is scarce, furniture producers tend to prefer directing inventory to retailers that will pay upfront, Mr. Shah noted. Once suppliers start dealing with excess inventory, Wayfair should be better positioned to direct more business—potentially at cheaper prices—through its website.</p><p>After a 60% drop in its share price in the year to date, Wayfair's enterprise value is less than forward-12-month sales, giving it a valuation that is closer to mature retailer Walmart than e-commerce peers. It was one thing to grab market share in a quickly expanding market. With a tough backdrop for both e-commerce and furniture, Wayfair has a steep climb ahead.</p><p>Wayfair Loses Its Way</p>",
