  "text": "<p>The new sale is essentially another Amazon Prime Day event, where subscribers can get certain deals for a 48-hour period, just with a different name.</p><p>As millions of shoppers are impacted by record-high inflation in the U.S., some data still suggest, consumers are still set to spend more than last year this holiday season.</p><p>According to data insights from Adobe Inc. ADBE, online-only holiday spending(Nov. 1 to Dec. 31) is expected to grow 2.5% in 2022, representing the smallest increase since Adobe began tracking this data in 2015. In 2021, holiday spending was 8.6% higher than the year prior, despite, at the time, the rate of U.S. inflation at a 30-year high.</p><p>Here's what you need to know about Amazon's Early Access Sale:</p><p>When is Amazon Prime's Early Access Sale?</p><p>Amazon's savings event is two days long, running from Tuesday, Oct. 11 through Wednesday, Oct. 12.</p><p>What time does Amazon Prime's Early Access Sale start?</p><p>The Early Access Sale started at midnight PT (3 a.m. ET) on Tuesday, Oct. 11, and runs for 48 hours, through the end of the day on Wednesday, Oct. 12.</p><p>Which countries participate in Amazon Prime's Early Access Sale?</p><p>Fifteen countries in total are participating in the deals. Those countries include: Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S., according to Amazon.</p><p>How does Amazon Prime's Early Access Sale work?</p><p>Items for sale can be viewed on Amazon.com or on Amazon's app. Anybody can locate which items are listed on sale through Amazon's platform, but the deals are only available to Prime subscribers, similar to how Amazon's flagship annual savings event Prime Day is structured.</p><p>Is Amazon Prime's Early Access Sale only for Prime members?</p><p>Yes. Only Prime members can participate in the deals.
