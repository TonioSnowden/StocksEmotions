The company and its auditors attributed the weakness to “limited accounting department personnel capable of appropriately accounting for complex transactions,” according to the prospectus.</p><p>“While we continue to take remediation steps, including hiring additional personnel subsequent to December 31, 2020, we continued to have a limited number of personnel with the level of GAAP accounting knowledge, specifically related to complex accounting transactions, commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. As such, we continued to have a material weakness in our control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.”</p><p>The Renaissance IPO ETF IPO is up 7.3% for the year to date while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained 18.9% for the period.</p>",
