  "text": "<p>Retail veteran Lord Stuart Rose has been appointed chair of Asda, the UK's third-largest supermarket group. </p> <p>The appointment of the former Marks and Spencer chief executive brings Asda and EG Group, both owned by the billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and the private equity group TDR Capital, even closer together. </p> <p>Though the two are separate entities, both boards will be made up of the Issa brothers, TDR executives Gary Lindsay and Manjit Dale, Rose, and Dame Alison Carnwath, the former Land Securities chair. </p> <p>EG's board also features former BP executive John Carey, who will not join the Asda board, which includes Walmart's US chief operating officer Chris Nicholas. </p> <p>Asda has not yet appointed a chief executive after Roger Burnley's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/163d92fa-d227-4877-8554-406ee0fa0335\">early departure</a> from the role in August. Mohsin Issa spends four days a week at the grocer's Leeds headquarters and any new chief executive would have to adjust to the owner's active involvement, people close to the matter said.</p> <p>Rose and Carnwath, both of whom are due to join the Asda board next month, “have already provided invaluable support and wisdom to the board of EG Group, and we know their insight and experience will add huge value at Asda too”, the Issa brothers said in a statement. The grocer would appoint more non-executive directors in the future, they added.</p> <p>Rose, who said it was a “hugely exciting time” to join Asda, stepped down as chair of Ocado this year. He was brought in to chair EG Group at the beginning of this year after Deloitte resigned as its auditor over governance concerns last year.</p> <p>The Issa brothers and TDR agreed to buy Asda from Walmart in a £6.8bn deal agreed last year. </p> <p>They had planned to finance the deal with a complicated series of debt deals and asset sales that included selling Asda's petrol stations to EG Group for £750m. However, the forecourts sale was called off last month after fuel suppliers refused to maintain the same terms that had been available to the supermarket group. </p> <p>That left the grocer stumping up about £250m of its own cash and taking on an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f18a086-c73a-4555-bad3-85dcf609c2c7\">extra half a billion pounds in debt</a> to fund the transaction. </p> <p>Asda and EG have previously said they plan to jointly launch 28 convenience stores under the Asda On the Move brand this year, and up to 200 next year. </p><p>Source: Kaye Wiggins in London 2021 'Stuart Rose appointed Asda chair' FT.com 23 November.
