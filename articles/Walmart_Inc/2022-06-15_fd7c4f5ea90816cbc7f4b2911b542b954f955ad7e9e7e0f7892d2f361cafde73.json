  "text": "<p>It's bad for a shop when customers start buying fewer of its wares. It is even worse if it still has a lot of those wares on its shelves. And it's worse still if all the money customers have been putting into gasoline makes them think twice before buying more stuff.</p><p>That is where many retailers find themselves right now.</p><p>The Commerce Department on Wednesday said that retail sales slipped a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May from a month earlier—worse than the 0.1% gain economists had been looking for. Excluding auto dealers, which are still struggling to get cars onto their lots, sales rose 0.5%. But that, too, was lower than forecast, and was boosted by a 4% price-induced increase in sales at gasoline stations.</p><p>The details of the report showed that some of the biggest winners in the pandemic are now experiencing setbacks. Sales at furniture and home-furnishing stores fell 0.9% from April, for example, while sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 1.3%. Sales at nonstore retailers—a category dominated by Amazon.com—fell 1%.</p><p>Meanwhile, sales at eating and drinking places rose 0.7%, a reflection of how people are redirecting their spending away from home goods toward categories like dining out. Apparel-store sales eked out a 0.1% gain, and sales at department stores—many of which sell the clothes people now want for travel, heading back to the office and entertaining—rose 0.9%.</p><p>So the report is in keeping with the big shift that has been occurring in spending habits, with people less interested in buying goods they wanted when they were hunkered down at home, and more interested in spending on things such as travel. But it underscores just how wrenching the process is for a lot of retailers, many of which thought the shift would come more slowly.</p><p>Indeed, separate inventory figures released Wednesday show that the value of inventories at retailers excluding auto dealers rose 1.7% in April from March—a gain that easily exceeds inflation that month. Stores were laying in more stuff and, as investors in companies like Target and Walmart learned, in many cases they didn't need it. Discounts are coming.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How are higher fuel costs changing your spending habits? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The high price of gasoline could make that inventory even harder to clear. Even though U.S. households appear still to have ample savings accumulated during the pandemic, that doesn't mean they will be carefree with their money. A $50 fill-up hurts and, when it comes to thinking about where to cut back, a lot of pandemic categories probably come to mind first. You just bought the dining set last year, so maybe skip buying the ottoman—especially now that you're at home less. Cutting back on sorely missed nights out with friends, or the shirt that won't make you look like a schlub in the office, is less appealing.</p><p>A strong job market and strong household balance sheets suggest that Americans will keep boosting their overall purchases in the months ahead. But for retailers on the wrong side of the spending shift, it could still feel like a recession.</p><p>Retailers Are Getting Tanked</p>",
