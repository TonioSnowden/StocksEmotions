  "title": "U.S. News:  Wage Rise Would Cut Jobs, Study Says  ----  By Eric Morath and Andrew Duehren",
  "text": "<p>   Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 could deliver raises for 27 million workers and lift 900,000 Americans above the poverty threshold -- but the policy would cost 1.4 million Americans their jobs over the next four years, according to a study released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday. </p><p>   President Biden and many Democrats are pursuing legislation to more than double the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour in phases, saying it would lift many low-wage workers out of poverty and deliver pay increases to many essential employees during the pandemic, including workers at grocery stores and warehouses. Republicans and some businesses and economists have warned that such an increase could cost jobs as the U.S. recovers from pandemic layoffs. </p><p>   While the CBO study finds poverty-reducing effects, its broader findings could make it difficult for proponents of an increase to rally enough votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009. </p><p>   The study reaffirms a finding that a $15 minimum wage could cost the U.S. jobs, slightly increasing a job-loss estimate from a widely cited 2019 CBO study. While many Americans would see raises, the analysis showed a minimum-wage increase would cause prices to rise, the federal budget deficit to widen and overall economic output to slightly decrease over the next decade. </p><p>   Whether to include the minimum-wage increase in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package has divided Democrats, who can't afford to lose a single vote in the evenly split Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) has publicly said he is opposed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, while progressive lawmakers have pushed for the increase. </p><p>   Higher wages would increase the cost of producing goods and services, and businesses would pass some of those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices, resulting in reduced demand, the CBO said. </p><p>   \"Employers would consequently produce fewer goods and services, and as a result, they would tend to reduce their employment of workers at all wage levels,\" the report said. \"Young, less educated people would account for a disproportionate share of those reductions in employment.\" </p><p>   While more than one million would lose jobs, the report said 17 million U.S. workers, or about 10% of the labor force, would have their pay increased. An additional 10 million workers who earn slightly more than $15 an hour could also potentially see pay rises. </p><p>   The study assumes a June 1 effective date for the bill, raising the federal minimum wage to $9.50 an hour. Under the plan, the wage would be increased annually until reaching $15 an hour in 2025, after which, the pay floor would be adjusted based on the change to the median wage of all workers. </p><p>   From 2021 to 2031, the plan would increase payments to workers by a net $333 billion, after accounting for wage increases and job losses, the study found. That would allow low-income workers to spend more, but would increase labor costs for businesses and raise prices, especially at restaurants. The loss of jobs would cause a modest negative overall impact on economic growth. </p><p>   The study found a much smaller impact on the federal budget. The cumulative federal budget deficit from 2021 to 2031 would increase by $54 billion if a $15 federal minimum was enacted largely because higher prices for goods and services would contribute to an increase in federal spending, the report found. That impact is small relative to the last fiscal year's $3.1 trillion deficit. </p><p>   That includes increased health-care expenditures. The study noted that by 2025 there are expected to be three million workers in the home health-care and nursing-care industries who would earn less than $15 an hour, if the law isn't changed. Many of those workers are paid through programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. </p><p>   The study found the government would spend more on health-care programs, unemployment insurance compensation and Social Security, and that a relatively small number of federal workers could receive a raise. Those increased outlays would be only partially offset by less spending on nutrition programs, the earned-income tax credits and by higher taxes paid by workers who would receive raises. </p><p>   Businesses are divided on the $15 minimum wage. Some, including Amazon.com Inc. and Target Corp. have raised their starting wages to $15 an hour. Other businesses haven't endorsed a $15-an-hour pay floor, especially those in rural areas where the cost of living is lower. Walmart Inc., the nation's largest private employer, starts workers at $11 an hour. </p><p></p>",
