Throw away your masks or continue to wear them. [The] long-awaited guidance from the government has done little to dispel that confusion,” he said. </p> <p>Moreover, the directions that leave Covid-19&#xa0;safety arrangements to individual businesses come as new infections, driven by the Delta variant of the virus, continue to rise. Official data today showed infections in England <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45b93d1-2839-4359-9132-3744014cb789#post-174e65fa-1ffb-480b-ad97-4e7948db30ab\">leapt 43 per cent to 577,000</a> in the week to July 10 from the previous week.</p> <p>The country's Big Four supermarkets — Tesco, J Sainsbury, Asda and Wm Morrison — have decided to encourage shoppers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6554dc23-3a0e-4bf1-a477-dabd5867d4cd\">continue wearing masks</a> and will keep pandemic measures such as limiting the number of customers in store. Many retailers resent being asked to take sides over face coverings: “It's an invidious position to be put in,” said one. “The whole issue is very divisive.” </p> <p>Meanwhile, so many workers are being “pinged” by the NHS Covid app that UK businesses are being hit with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/560613f2-2421-4dcf-9476-b55bd383b1f8\">staff shortages</a> just as they try to capitalise on the economy reopening. More than half a million people were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa8a7270-1e8e-4390-b0be-01dc8775c80c\">told to self-isolate</a> last week after coming into contact with someone who had the virus, a 10-fold jump in a month.&#xa0;</p> <p>Nissan's plant in Sunderland, the largest car factory in the UK, has more than 700 workers self-isolating; <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45b93d1-2839-4359-9132-3744014cb789#post-2401c3f4-e5a9-49b6-9f18-573226790408\">ports</a> are grappling with their worst staff shortages since the pandemic began; and manufacturers' organisation Make UK says some companies are missing 20 per cent of their staff.</p> <p>Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland Foods, said coronavirus-related absences were “growing exponentially. Within a week or two they'll be the highest ever. This will be a shit show for business”.</p> <p>The situation could ease from August 16, when fully vaccinated people will no longer need to self-isolate when instructed by the app. Business groups have called on the government to bring forward the date to coincide with the lifting of restrictions and ministers are said to be working on a solution that will allow people to return to work more quickly.</p> <p>Other initiatives from the government include a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45b93d1-2839-4359-9132-3744014cb789#post-2aa0856d-9c43-4ae8-98ae-5da5d31d1eb8\">hospitality strategy</a>, published today, which relaxes licensing restrictions and encourages employment in the sector, which has been hit hard by an exodus of workers because of Brexit, as well as the pandemic.</p> <p>Irrespective of the mood in business, it is not clear, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45b93d1-2839-4359-9132-3744014cb789#post-cd7de371-f211-487f-8533-d308c56ab1b8\">according to a new poll</a>, that the wider British public is ready for the final lifting of restrictions on Monday. And for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45b93d1-2839-4359-9132-3744014cb789#post-14e31d91-7ae7-43d0-95f5-1174e6cfa250\">clinically vulnerable</a>, “freedom day” is awaited with a mix of anger and apprehension.</p> <p><em>How is your business planning to adapt to the lifting of restrictions? Email us at </em><a href=\"mailto: covid@ft.com\"><em>covid@ft.com</em></a>.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p><strong>Children</strong> have been the most significant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01eb69c4-202d-4d51-b7b5-0deed2cc5db4\">indirect victims of the pandemic</a>, with the economic shock disproportionately affecting poorer families and pushing up to 142m children below the poverty line, writes economic commentator Martin Sandbu. But there is good reason to see the crisis, and its dire consequences for children, also as an opportunity, he argues. <em>Read our special report: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/unicef-delivering-worlds-children\"><em><strong>Delivering for the World's Children</strong></em></a></p> <p>New <strong>weekly</strong> <strong>jobless claims</strong> in the US fell to their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5366f23-f6fd-4c36-82db-79cef60ab6a0#post-94bba50d-93e7-4abc-9bd4-b07baa6ec51f\">lowest pandemic-era level</a> of 360,000 as businesses slowed down job losses and stepped up hiring. For <strong>Fed officials</strong> however, employment is still too far below pre-pandemic levels to force them to start <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37d57052-c2a5-4a44-8b27-9d205a2a1c50\">pulling back their support</a> for the economy. The <strong>surge in inflation</strong> in the US and Europe is fuelling concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61346c2f-de96-4ad7-91c1-028efe4706ff\">risk of economies overheating</a>, putting pressure on policymakers to begin slimming down their stimulus programmes. </p> <p>A parliamentary report urged the <strong>Bank of England</strong> to provide better arguments for its belief that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60d239bf-ea75-4dae-ada4-eed9cfd4fb3a\">rise in inflation</a> was temporary and also queried the need for continued quantitative easing. A second member of the central bank's monetary policy committee signalled he could vote to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96481a3f-ca83-41df-9112-0a0897ab55f1\">pare back its bond-buying programme</a> as soon as next month. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>Consumer and retail groups reported mixed fortunes as earnings season continued. Sales at British luxury group <strong>Burberry </strong>have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b87b047c-03b0-4776-8290-3609d31025f1\">returned to pre-coronavirus levels</a>; UK retailer <strong>Asos</strong> suffered as travel restrictions meant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4ffff13-68f5-4263-98d6-2ebb72174a01\">less interest in holiday gear</a>; and <strong>Uniqlo</strong>, Asia's largest clothing retailer, warned that the recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5366f23-f6fd-4c36-82db-79cef60ab6a0#post-c37c29ec-84b6-4ccf-838b-239248f86e47\">upsurge in coronavirus cases</a> in Japan and elsewhere would hit sales. On the plus side, <strong>Hammerson</strong>, which operates shopping centres across Europe, reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5366f23-f6fd-4c36-82db-79cef60ab6a0#post-a940221a-cec9-475a-9967-3f2602b34b90\">“encouraging” footfall</a> from returning customers. </p> <p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> was the latest Wall Street bank to report second-quarter earnings, with a similar tale to its rivals of profiting from the pandemic-driven <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/816b165a-b891-4638-8ae6-fa272d0fca4c\">boom in mergers and acquisitions</a>. Revenues rose 8 per cent to $14.8bn and net income rose from $3.2bn a year ago to $3.5bn. US retail banks are <strong>busy closing branches</strong> after customers became <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26764d8b-9c5f-420a-901c-eaed97dda412\">more comfortable using apps</a> during the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Covax</strong>, the UN-backed project to make sure developing countries get their fair share of vaccines, is setting up a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81c94b7d-e30c-43ff-b9e0-4191be8d64cb\">marketplace to fix supply chain bottlenecks</a>. The platform will match vaccine makers with suppliers of components such as bioreactor bags and vials to transport doses and will enable suppliers to reallocate unused materials.</p> <h1>Markets </h1> <p><strong>Global equity investors</strong> continued to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/704fe5dc-89cd-461e-a0e0-3d4f68f1b18c\">juggle worries</a> about the spread of the Delta variant and slowing growth in China with a potentially stellar US earnings season and reassurances from the Fed that current rises in inflation were transitory. </p> <p><strong>Rating agencies</strong> are busy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76893129-5e6e-435c-aa47-c22e174ec195\">upgrading US corporate debt</a> in a sign of corporate America's return to profitability. Some $361bn of investment grade bonds have been upgraded in the past two months, also reflecting the advance of vaccination and low borrowing costs enabled by the Fed's pandemic measures. </p> <p><strong>Sydney Airport</strong> rejected a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb0e3824-bcfd-4707-8faf-4f8197e06839\">$17bn takeover offer</a>, one of the largest in Australia's history, arguing it was set to benefit from the rebound in international travel. The company's shares were unmoved as investors bet on an improved or rival offer. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>Eoghann </em>comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ecee317-2c6c-44fa-969e-f23ef89cec16?commentID=fc0c4fd6-b4a1-44b1-b4cd-e47ea4b6bbba\">Tui tells staff to spend just one day a month in office in Covid working shift</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>This is the future of work. The majority of my job can be done remotely, but I still need to be in London to build external relationships face-to-face, present at events and train customers. None of this requires office space, but it does require me to live in London. Many jobs at my company (and beyond) are like this, and the ones that aren't were long ago relocated to India. Previously, I was frustrated that the systems didn't exist for me to work from home, but now things work mostly seamlessly and in some cases better than in the office. Post-Covid we will have huge flexibility across the company but a smaller office footprint for people who don't have the space to work from home. My guess is that this set-up will be the same across financial services, and Tui have got the future of work bang-on.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>With travel restrictions making booking a holiday abroad risky business, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6876587-96c0-4c66-b575-215711c0d80b\">camping holidays</a> are back in demand.
