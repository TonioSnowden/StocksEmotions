  "text": "<p>BrewDog, the UK's largest craft brewer, has appointed City grandee Allan Leighton as its chair three months after former staff accused the company of operating a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6733b4b5-e403-4de7-8daa-a7c04d41622f\">“culture of fear”</a>.</p> <p>Leighton, who takes up his role immediately, has been brought in to provide “experienced counsel on leadership and governance matters” and will act as a mentor to BrewDog founder and chief executive James Watt, the group said.</p> <p>Leighton is also chair of retailer The Co-Operative Group and the casual dining chain PizzaExpress. He was previously chief executive of supermarket group Asda and jewellery retailer Pandora, and has also chaired Royal Mail and Wagamama restaurants.</p> <p>His appointment comes as BrewDog prepares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/964b92ae-18d7-41a0-b8f1-138baa54870e\">to list</a> on the stock market. Its initial public offering had been planned for 2020 until the pandemic hit.</p> <p>“This is a very good business but it could be a great business. It has many points of uniqueness,” Leighton told the Financial Times. </p> <p>He likened the brewer to the engineering company Dyson, whose products shook up the traditional vacuum cleaning industry in the 1990s. “BrewDog can become a category all of its own in the same way,” he said.</p> <p>Watt said: “[Leighton] brings immense experience and a phenomenal track record to BrewDog. I have no doubt we will all benefit from his insight and leadership.”</p> <p>Leighton will replace Blythe Jack, managing director at private equity company TSG Consumer Partners, who was made interim chair earlier this year. She was appointed to oversee a governance review following the accusations of 45 former employees who said in an open letter in June that the “single biggest shared experience of former staff is a residual feeling of fear”.</p> <p>TSG bought a 22 per cent stake in the Aberdeenshire-based brewer in 2017. </p> <p>BrewDog has committed to an internal cultural review run by the advisory company Wiser and has pushed up staff salaries. The former employees said the company had been pursuing “growth at all costs”.</p> <p>“We have been so high-growth in the past few years and had a difficult time coming through Covid and we haven't always dealt with that challenge,” Watt told the FT last month.</p> <p>Leighton said that BrewDog had dealt “reasonably well” with addressing the issues raised by former staff about its culture. “This is a high growth disruptive entrepreneurial business and when you have those ingredients you have growing pains,” he added.</p> <p>Founded in 2007, BrewDog grew rapidly amid the UK's craft beer boom raising more than £94m to date through <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ad0e222-a35b-4ae8-aa16-27f1feb964a5\">crowdfunding</a>. </p> <p>It was valued at almost £2bn in its latest crowdfunding round and posted a pre-tax loss of £13.1m for 2020 with net revenues of £182m.</p> <p>BrewDog said on Monday that 99 of its 104 bars and hotels were now open and operating after lockdowns and that it had opened its third hotel, in Manchester, last month.</p> <p>It is also planning new bar openings in Germany and the US.</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock in London 2021 'BrewDog names Allan Leighton as chair' FT.com 13 September.
