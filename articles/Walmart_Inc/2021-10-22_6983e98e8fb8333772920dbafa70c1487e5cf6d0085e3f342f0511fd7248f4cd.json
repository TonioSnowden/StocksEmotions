  "text": "<p>J Sainsbury has stopped pursuing a sale of its banking arm after concluding that a deal would be of no benefit to shareholders.</p> <p>The London-based retailer received <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4294bd7a-8a7f-47fb-b55d-5023d6893022\">expressions of interest</a> in its banking business in November last year. </p> <p>However, in a statement on Friday it said the board had now concluded a sale did not “offer better value for shareholders than will be realised through retaining Sainsbury's Bank”.</p> <p>“We continue to make progress strengthening and simplifying our financial services business in line with our strategy and we remain comfortable with consensus profit forecasts for the division,” the company added. </p> <p>Analysts expect the financial services arm to reach an underlying profit of £26m in the 2021-22 financial year, increasing to £43m the following year. </p> <p>The complicating presence of a banking division has the potential to deter bidders for the group. </p> <p>Following the takeovers of rivals Asda and Wm Morrison this year, the UK's second-largest supermarket chain has been the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a0ebd09-fc17-410d-8975-c447c09cfb1c\">focus of speculation</a> about a private-equity approach. </p> <p>Shares in the group were down 1 per cent in early trading.</p> <p>The banking unit provides services such as mortgages, credit cards and insurance to more than 2m customers, but has been squeezed by low interest rates and a fall in demand for services such as travel money and cashpoints during the pandemic. </p> <p>In the year to March 6 it made an operating loss of £21m, largely because of a provision against expected defaults by cash-strapped customers during the pandemic that remains largely unutilised.</p> <p>Investors had grown concerned about the bank's poor profitability and need for regular capital injections. In response, chief executive Simon Roberts and his predecessor Mike Coupe both pledged no further infusions of cash and a programme to improve profitability and reduce risk.</p> <p>Sainsbury's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc0fb336-db75-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">halted new mortgage lending</a> in 2019 to concentrate on less capital-intensive services such as travel money, insurance and credit cards.</p> <p>Savings rates offered by the bank have been cut sharply, with the blended average falling to 0.44 per cent last year from 1.18 per cent the year before. As a result, £1.2bn of deposits were withdrawn but total lending also fell 27 per cent to £5.4bn, improving capital ratios. </p> <p>However, the ratio of costs to income remains high at 71 per cent. Management aims to reduce that to “around 50 per cent” by 2024.</p> <p>Many retailers, including Marks and Spencer, John Lewis and Tesco, entered financial services in the 1990s when interest rate spreads were wide and lending growth strong.</p> <p>But since the financial crisis, mortgage lending in particular has become more competitive and less profitable. Tesco <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7feb0c64-ce15-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\">sold its mortgage book</a> to Lloyds Bank for £3.8bn in 2019. Both it and Sainsbury's increasingly regard their financial services arms as businesses that deepen customer relationships and support loyalty in the core food business, rather than as “challenger banks”.</p> <p>M&amp;S and John Lewis have adopted a different strategy. Both use HSBC to offer private label services with a focus on credit cards, insurance and investment products rather than mortgages and lending.</p> <p>John Lewis is expanding its financial services operation as it looks to diversify its revenue streams beyond retailing. It recently launched individual savings accounts in conjunction with online wealth manager Nutmeg and has revamped its insurance offering. </p><p>Source: Adrienne Klasa and Jonathan Eley 2021 'Sainsbury's ends talks to sell banking unit' FT.com 22 October.
