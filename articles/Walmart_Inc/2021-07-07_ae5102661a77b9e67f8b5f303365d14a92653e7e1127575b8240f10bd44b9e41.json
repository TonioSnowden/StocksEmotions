  "text": "<p>“Chief medical officer at Dollar General” sounds like an odd job title. The discount store chain specialises in selling cheap goods to low-income Americans often in rural, underserved areas. That has brought it success rare for a physical retailer. Now with more than 17,000 stores dotting America and a market worth of more than $50bn, it is exploring new avenues to keep up its breakneck growth. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the business announced that it would expand its <a href=\"https://investor.dollargeneral.com/websites/dollargeneral/English/2120/us-press-release.html?airportNewsID=0bc16540-f70d-4b18-a92a-24334ada106d\">healthcare offerings</a> to common over-the-counter treatments for everyday needs. It has hired Albert Wu, a physician-turned-McKinsey consultant, as CMO to oversee the healthcare push. </p> <p>The company has announced no plans to get into the pharmacy business. But with healthcare spending in the US chewing up a fifth of the economy, healthcare is a part of its customer's wallet it can no longer ignore.</p> <p>Dollar General says core customers earn less than $40,000 per year. Their finances are precarious enough that they often choose canned fruits over fresh to save money. Stores are smaller than a Walmart or traditional grocery and have a limited product assortment. </p> <p>In a polarised US economy, this is a sweet spot. In the past five years, Dollar General shares are up 136 per cent while supermarket chain Kroger is flat. In 2020, same-store sales jumped 16 per cent, the 31st straight year of increases.</p> <p>Dollar General's next act will however be trickier as it trades at a robust 20 times forward earnings. It is rolling out larger stores and trying to get customers to buy “non-consumables” as well as perishable, fresh foods. OTC health products are a natural next step given the consumer traffic stores generate. </p> <p>Could Dollar General do something bolder? </p> <p>Its customers are an underserved population. Healthcare is increasingly focused on wellness and preventive care. Dr Wu, an expert in rural healthcare, has a chance to make the chain a helpful outpost among marginalised people. The company has been maligned for “exploitation”, as often happens to businesses catering to the working poor. Low-cost, in-store pharmacies or clinics would give the lie to that accusation — and foster footfall.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers is published twice weekly.
