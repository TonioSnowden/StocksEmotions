  "title": "Afghans Get Help Resettling in U.S. From an Earlier Generation of Refugees; Afghan-American community's assistance to thousands evacuated from Kabul is critical as agencies also brace for a wave of Ukrainian arrivals",
  "text": "<p>\"Those aren't things where you can just be like, 'Oh, I'll do a quick drop-off,' \" said Meena Javid, one of Zora's two daughters, who are also providing help. \"A lot of the families need so much more help.\"</p><p>As the government works to resettle almost 80,000 Afghans evacuated from Kabul last summer after the Taliban took control, those already living in the U.S. like Ms. Javid are finding that they have become the main—and sometimes the only—source of stable help.</p><p>That may become even more so as the U.S. prepares to accept as many as 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled their country after Russia's invasion in February.</p><p>Formal resettlement agencies, which receive small stipends from the State Department, are still underfunded from years of cuts through the Trump administration, and caseworkers are now buckling under family caseloads four or five times what they normally handle. For the past five years, agencies have been asked to resettle fewer than 45,000 refugees a year—compared with the 76,000 Afghans who were all resettled within a few months of the August evacuation.</p><p>\"We are incredibly grateful for and inspired by the dedication of our resettlement partners, volunteers and community sponsors across the country involved in this effort,\" a State Department spokesman said.</p><p>In few places is this dynamic more apparent than in Virginia, where the Afghan community is the second-largest in the country at about 60,000 people, according to the Muslim Association of Virginia. Those that fled after the Soviet invasion in the 1980s, like Ms. Javid, were followed by widows and their children escaping the Taliban's first rise to power 20 years ago.</p><p>In the past decade, hundreds of former interpreters and translators who worked with the U.S. military began moving here with their families. The Taliban's return to power last summer created the most recent wave.</p><p>Ms. Javid remembers the loneliness she felt when she arrived in the Washington, D.C., area in 1983. No one she knew apart from her family spoke Dari.</p><p>Now, Afghan mosques, restaurants and supermarkets dot the Northern Virginia area. The community is so large and resourced that it has become what resettlement leaders say is the most-requested destination for the most recent new arrivals.</p><p>The region's Afghan community has used WhatsApp to coordinate sending donations around the country and set up donation sites locally, such as a 5,000-square-foot warehouse in Woodbridge, Va., that volunteers set up like a Walmart or Costco. On one recent Saturday, several Afghan families walked through the aisles pushing shopping carts, perusing shelves of kitchen appliances, color-coded clothing and toys arranged by age.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is the U.S. doing enough to support refugees from Afghanistan? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Some residents of Northern Virginia have objected to a new Biden administration plan to process thousands of evacuees this spring at a private conference center in Leesburg, Va., where they will likely need to live for several months before being permanently resettled.</p><p>At a February town hall meeting in Leesburg, Homeland Security officials announced the plan and were met by local residents who expressed anger that they hadn't been consulted before the government signed a contract with the conference center. They also expressed concerns about increased crime and traffic issues. The officials assured them that the evacuees would be required to stay on the conference-center grounds and additional security would be installed.</p><p>\"On some level, there is some forgetting that these people aren't fully resettled and standing on their feet yet,\" said Saber Zaher, president and co-founder of Husayn for Humanity, a local group helping to coordinate Afghan resettlement efforts.</p><p>Shekeba Morrad, an Afghan-American who was born in Virginia to refugee parents, stood near the center's entrance directing other volunteers as they carried in new donations and sorted them. Most nights, after her shift ends, she drops off donations and visits more families, she said.</p><p>She had grown more connected to Afghanistan when her parents returned there as U.S. citizens to work as linguists with the military, and was further motivated to help the newcomers by the \"horror stories\" they had told her about the way the Taliban treated Afghans who worked with the Americans.</p><p>One Sunday afternoon, Ms. Javid and her daughters visited a former security supervisor at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Mohammad, who had been evacuated in August with his wife, Asma, and two toddler boys. The family was resettled last fall in a modest two-bedroom apartment in a Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C., 30 minutes from the heart of the Afghan community in Virginia. The Wall Street Journal agreed to use only his first name.</p><p>The family has been assigned a caseworker from the International Rescue Committee, but they have only seen her once in the three months they have lived in their apartment, he said.</p><p>The Javids came with puzzles for the boys and short-sleeve shirts for the family as spring season arrived. What was intended to be a brief drop-off turned into an afternoon of chatting over poppy-seed cake and green tea, as one of Ms. Javid's daughters attempted to fix the family's donated TV and the other showed the older toddler how to blow bubbles through a wand.</p><p>The parents are struggling to acclimate to their new surroundings. Their English classes are being taught on Zoom, and neither husband nor wife has started to learn how to drive. Their older son Mohammad, who is 4, showed off the little English he knew by counting from one to 10.</p><p>Over a homemade meal of Afghan beef and cilantro dumplings that his wife had prepared for the visit, Mohammad said he is worried about the next phase of his changed life.</p><p>His three months of government rental assistance is set to end, and he doesn't know how he will pay the $1,300 rent next month. He wanted to find a job as a security guard, but his work permit just arrived in the mail the previous Friday.</p><p>He also remains anxious about the family he had to leave behind. Ms. Javid urged him to look forward. \"There's no use wishing you were there,\" she told him. \"You need to stay strong because, at the end of the day, you are living here for you and for them.\"</p><p>Write to Michelle Hackman at michelle.hackman+1@wsj.com</p><p>Afghans Get Help Resettling in U.S. From an Earlier Generation of Refugees</p>",
