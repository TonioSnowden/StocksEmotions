  "text": "<h2>A private equity reckoning is coming. Will it stick?</h2> <p>Private equity dealmakers may one day look back on the past few years akin to the way Wall Street veterans look back on the period leading up to the financial crisis, if <strong>Jonathan Kanter</strong> has his way.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f4cc882-1444-4ea3-8a31-c382364aace1\">interview</a> with the FT's Stefania Palma and DD's James Fontanella-Khan, the US's top antitrust enforcer warned that the <strong>Department of Justice</strong> will take a tougher stance on buyout firms like Blackstone, KKR and Apollo, which have planted their flags on vast corners of the US economy.</p> <p>“Sometimes [the motive of a private equity firm is] designed to hollow out or roll up an industry and essentially cash out,” said Kanter. “That business model is often very much at odds with the law, and very much at odds with the competition we're trying to protect.”</p> <p>The head of the DoJ's antitrust unit is one of several progressive officials appointed by <strong>Joe Biden</strong> to top antitrust roles alongside US <strong>Federal Trade Commission </strong>chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eba8d3d7-dba7-4389-858c-5406c31b413d\"><strong>Lina Khan</strong></a> as the president's administration seeks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8893550-fc6c-4301-879d-209aa9323f5b\">rein in anti-competitive deals</a>.</p> <p>“Many of the mergers we're confronting are as a result of [private equity] roll-ups,” he said, referring to buyout firms scooping up then merging several businesses in the same industry.</p> <p>Private equity executives pulled in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df74c731-4d50-4420-8380-c83205c4c055\">$23.4bn</a> in compensation and benefits last year, eclipsing what was already a mega payday for Wall Street's army of investment bankers and harking back to a time when <strong>Lehman Brothers </strong>and <strong>Bear Stearns </strong>staff would flex their bonus cheques in lower Manhattan's most exclusive haunts.</p> <p>Knocking the so-called Masters of the Universe off their pedestals and on to the same level of scrutiny as Big Tech won't be without its challenges, though.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">record 14,730 deals</a> worth $1.2tn inked globally last year encapsulate only part of private equity's ever-widening reach, as private debt transactions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac996df1-497c-42ae-a0a6-71a7595aab4a\">surge</a> and firms bypass banks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29f6cf4b-72ac-486d-a7cc-d772e92f5569\">finance their own leveraged buyouts</a>.</p> <p>Traditional asset managers are getting in on the game too, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8d45e1f-e30b-411e-81e1-cfb78bf57fc4\">snapping up alternative investment groups</a> as they seek to stave off competition from private equity titans and diversify away from stocks and bonds. </p> <p><strong>BlackRock</strong>'s alternative assets have more than doubled in five years to $265bn, for one. Perhaps <strong>Larry Fink</strong> was motivated by how modest his $36mn in pay last year looked next to&#xa0; the $610.5mn <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong> received in pay and dividends.</p> <p>All the while, private equity has continued to ingratiate itself deeper into the mainstream US financial system, as powerhouses like <strong>TPG</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd93e65-9cc5-4156-9489-214b7a8c44d2\">go public</a> and others <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8f6efe3-592f-4dac-ab9f-a70648d34cb8\">sell record amounts of debt</a> at the level of the buyout firm itself, to pay dividends or finance growth.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0253473-1996-4240-91a3-08a90cb89100\">predicted</a> that, on the high end, the private capital industry could swell as high as $30tn by 2026. Soon, it won't just be the old guard of private equity shops attempting to get huge buyout deals past regulators.</p> <h2>Another UK buyout in the books</h2> <p><strong>Homeserve</strong> boss <strong>Richard Harpin</strong>'s book on how to make it as an entrepreneur has only one review on Amazon: “1.0 out of 5 stars: The least useful business book I have ever read.”</p> <p>But after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865ab7cd-97e0-4096-a145-8645420a680e\">striking a £4bn deal</a> to sell his home repairs business to <strong>Brookfield Asset Management </strong>on Thursday, even the harshest of the British entrepreneur's critics would have to concede that he got at least one thing right.</p> <p>Harpin has become one of the UK's richest businesspeople since launching Homeserve in 1993 and listing it in 2004. He and his wife stand to reap a further £495m for their stakes if the deal goes through. </p> <p>This will keep a man who was famous for travelling via helicopter to its Walsall headquarters flying for some time. The UK's Conservative party, which has benefited from his donations in the past, might also be happy with the news. </p> <p>Parting from the company will be a bittersweet moment for Harpin, however, who has kept a close hand on the management although he says that Brookfield is the right fit to help Homeserve speed up expansion.</p> <p>Homeserve had been a “great British entrepreneurial success story”, said Harpin. “To conquer America, to be able to take that business model to 10 countries . . . I think we should be celebrating that success.”</p> <p>For private equity, that narrative fits the other way round. The deal is the latest in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/315a02d1-6606-433e-b6f4-1989f2fad27d\">M&amp;A spree</a> across corporate Britain by deep-pocketed North American buyout firms eager to capitalise on the low-interest-rate environment. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c21f0550-4f8d-4ea8-9fba-872eb174ba99\">eye-watering gains</a> pulled in by the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79964b33-2406-41c8-8f24-4ff5552f1669\">Issa brothers</a> and buyout group <strong>TDR Capital </strong>following their takeover of UK grocer <strong>Asda </strong>and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fb5f5d7-a397-4300-b0f3-90387ddb292a\">high-stakes battle</a> for its domestic rival <strong>Morrisons </strong>have only fuelled more demand.</p> <p>Brookfield, Canada's $725bn alternative asset manager, can squint just enough to see how the business could fit into its infrastructure arm. Although better known for its boiler repairs and online portal for tradespeople, Homeserve wants to move into low-carbon heating installation and electric charging points. Its US business now tops the UK's in terms of customers.</p> <p>The only clear loser from the deal is London's stock market, as lawmakers look to introduce regulatory reforms in the UK to attract new listings and retain old ones.</p> <p>Any investors arguing that the £12-a-share deal is pitched too low only have themselves to blame for not valuing the company higher when they still could.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bob Iger</strong>, <strong>Disney</strong>'s former chair and chief executive, is joining Philadelphia-based rapid delivery group <strong>Gopuff </strong>as an adviser to its co-founders and co-CEOs, <strong>Yakir Gola</strong> and <strong>Rafael Ilishayev</strong>. He is also becoming an investor in the company.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Royal Mail</strong> has appointed <strong>Wizz Air </strong>chief financial officer <strong>Jourik Hooghe</strong> as a non-executive director.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>National Grid </strong>has appointed<strong> GSK </strong>finance chief <strong>Iain Mackay<br></strong>as a non-executive director.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sands Capital Ventures</strong> has promoted <strong>Scott Frederick </strong>to managing partner. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Deal or no deal </strong>Corporate lawyers have been working to perfect the art of ironclad merger agreements ever since the financial crisis.
