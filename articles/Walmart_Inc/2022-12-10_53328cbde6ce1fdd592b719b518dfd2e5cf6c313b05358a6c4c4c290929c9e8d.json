  "text": "<p>Not that it is losing its alpha status anytime soon. Chewy said Thursday that revenue rose 14.5% from a year earlier in its quarter ended Oct. 30, better than the 10.8% that Wall Street analysts polled by Visible Alpha were expecting. That breaks a streak of six consecutive quarters of slowing year-over-year revenue growth, and easily tops Petco's 4% growth. Chewy turned a profit of $2.3 million, a pleasant surprise compared with the $33 million loss analysts were penciling in.</p><p>Following better-than-expected results and an upgrade in guidance, Chewy's stock rose 4% on Friday. The company's shares have fared far better than Petco and other e-commerce names. Chewy is down 26% year to date, but that is better than e-commerce names like Etsy, which is down 42%, and Wayfair, which is down 80%. At current prices, Chewy's enterprise value is roughly 1.6 times expected sales, a 10% discount to Amazon. Since its initial public offering, Chewy has traded at a 17.6% discount on average.</p><p>Chewy remains the dominant pet e-commerce player, capturing roughly 40% of the market, according to a report from MoffettNathanson. Holding on to that market share comes at a cost, though. Chewy spent roughly 23% more on advertising and marketing last quarter compared with the preceding quarter, but its active customer count rose by less than 0.2%. Data from SimilarWeb shows web traffic to Chewy declined 5.5% last quarter from a year earlier. Chewy Chief Executive Sumit Singh said on a Thursday earnings call that pet adoption is flat to slightly lower on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>The pet industry is due to get more competitive. Growth in the online pet product market is set to slow to 13% this year, according to MoffettNathanson estimates, a tame number compared with the 58% and 37% growth the industry saw in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Well-capitalized retailers, which have the ability to handle logistics at scale, are leaning into the sticky online pet business. Amazon this year launched its first 24-hour saving event for pets called Amazon Pet Day. Both Walmart and Target last year launched premium private-label brands in the pet category. MoffettNathanson expects Chewy's pet product e-commerce market share to drop sequentially every year through 2025.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Chewy itself has made some moves to improve its supply chain and logistics. Processing orders through its updated automated fulfillment center network, for example, was roughly 18%-20% cheaper than legacy fulfillment centers, the company said Thursday. The migration of more shipping volume to its automated fulfillment center network contributed to expanding gross margins last quarter. Chewy also keeps adding new lines of products and offerings: Recent ones include a private-label pet supplement brand and more insurance offerings in Chewy Health.</p><p>Bigger dogs might be entering the pet e-commerce space, but Chewy isn't going down without a fight.</p>",
