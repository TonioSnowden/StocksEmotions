The offer comes from <strong>Couche-Tard</strong>, a Canadian group that runs convenience stores mostly at petrol stations.&#xa0;</p> <p>“What is at stake is nothing less than the food sovereignty of France,” said Le Maire in a television interview on Wednesday night. “So the idea that Carrefour can be bought by a foreign competitor, at first glance I am not in favour of such a deal.”&#xa0;</p> <p>In effect, Le Maire is signalling that any bid from Couche-Tard would have to go through his ministry for approval since food-distribution is on a list of “sensitive” sectors in which the government can intervene, the FT's Leila Abboud <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05319282-cddc-4022-b31b-e5ad09b0ad0c\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Cue flashbacks to 2005 when France made it clear that the yoghurt company Danone was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d767f5e6-f93c-11d9-81f3-00000e2511c8\">off-limits</a> to foreign buyers.&#xa0;</p> <p>But that doesn't mean the deal is impossible. </p> <p>Le Maire's comments, while punchy, could be read as a manoeuvre to ensure that — with President <strong>Emmanuel Macron </strong>facing re-election next year — any takeover that's agreed is seen to protect the interests of the French consumer.&#xa0;</p> <p>The French state has intervened massively in the economy to support businesses and stave off mass unemployment during the pandemic so can't be seen to do nothing when the future of the biggest private-sector employer is at stake. It could yet wave through the deal if it received assurances on jobs, headquarters and governance.</p> <p>Couche-Tard would also have to win over Carrefour's three biggest shareholders, who together control about 23 per cent of the stock and have double voting rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>On the list: <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>, France's richest man and the billionaire founder of <strong>LVMH</strong>, the Brazilian billionaire <strong>Abilio Diniz</strong> and France's wealthy<strong> Moulin</strong> family, who own the department store group <strong>Galeries Lafayette</strong>.</p> <p>Couche-Tard, which owns the <strong>Circle-K </strong>convenience store chain and has a market value of $37bn, has been clamouring for a mega-deal for a while, having spent years growing through acquisitions.</p> <p>Last year it missed out in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2949629-95ad-4e9b-ba09-21e709c8642f\">battle</a> for <strong>Speedway</strong>, the US petrol station group owned by <strong>Marathon Petroleum</strong> that was eventually acquired by Japanese rival <strong>Seven &amp; i </strong>Holdings for $21bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Carrefour deal seems to be a bid to shift from being based heavily on gas stations to a more general grocery retailer — not unlike the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a978525-d0cc-4a14-ba83-63732ee14067\">logic</a> of the owners of UK petrol stations business <strong>EG Group</strong>, which last year agreed a £6.8bn deal for<strong> Asda</strong> with none of the government intervention that Couche-Tard may face in France.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1d2751-c341-4f81-a6a7-b81000e90d32\">Lex</a> column is sceptical, pointing out earlier on Wednesday that there is hardly any overlap between the two companies in geography or format and “a deal is not advisable simply because it is possible”. With his intervention, Le Maire has signalled that France demands to be consulted on what is possible.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The US joins Europe's telecoms dealmaking streak</h2> <p>Earlier this week DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e66ae96-fc6d-421a-896b-d9cf77129a3f\">ran the ruler</a> over <strong>Cellnex</strong>'s breakneck mergers and acquisitions strategy. Bankers we spoke to were adamant that the Spanish mobile towers group's endgame would probably be an acquisition by a larger rival such as <strong>American Tower</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it turns out the Americans were already on the move. American Tower, which only has a small presence in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cb05815-582f-425f-b87c-1cfd9fff4db9\">has bagged</a> a €7.7bn takeover of <strong>Telxius </strong>— <strong>Telefónica's</strong> tower arm — transforming it into a major player in Spain and Germany and strengthening its hand in Latin America.</p> <p>For Telefónica, the deal brings in much-needed cash to reduce its debt. It tried and failed to float Telxius in 2017 before <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eacfee2e-f824-11e6-9516-2d969e0d3b65\">selling minority stakes</a> to private equity shop <strong>KKR</strong> and the founder of <strong>Inditex</strong>'s investment company — with both now set to enjoy a bumper payday.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cellnex now faces competition from American Tower to scoop up other assets across Europe. It had designs on Telxius itself — a deal that would've opened up Germany and locked down its home market — and, as the FT's Nic Fildes reports, held talks with Telefónica over a deal in recent weeks.</p> <p>But it was outgunned by American Tower and also had no interest in the Latin American assets meaning, for once, it had a weaker hand in negotiations.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cellnex shouldn't be too disheartened, though. The American company paid 30.5 times trailing income for Telxius which, if applied to other tower companies including <strong>Vodafone</strong>'s <strong>Vantage</strong>,<strong> Inwit </strong>and itself, sets a very healthy valuation benchmark for asset owners.&#xa0;</p> <p>Telefónica, for example, still has a 50 per cent stake in the UK tower company <strong>Cornerstone</strong> which is up for sale, according to bankers, given that its owner has jettisoned all of its sister assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's clear that American Tower now intends to be a contestable force in that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffe9c3d8-f28c-4508-8c24-f18a7e44dd00\">consolidation process</a>. How the pieces of the tower jigsaw are put together remains to be seen.&#xa0;</p> <h2>LSE/Refinitiv: the big data exchange deal gains EU approval at last</h2> <p>For much of the past decade, the acid test of a multibillion-dollar exchange deal was to present it for approval by antitrust regulators in Brussels.<strong> Deutsche Börse</strong> had two failed megamergers, <strong>NYSE Euronext </strong>in 2012 and <strong>London Stock Exchange Group</strong> in 2017.</p> <p>That meant the LSE scored a notable victory on Wednesday when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1266dcec-e62e-4f11-8988-dfb4e5be2d3c\">secured consent</a> from the watchdog for its $27bn purchase of data and trading group <strong>Refinitiv</strong>.</p> <p>It's been a tortuous passage since it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddf40314-afc6-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2\">first broken</a> by the FT in July 2019 and announced days later.&#xa0;</p> <p>The LSE had been hoping to wrap the entire deal well before the end of last year, but a more protracted Brussels investigation than expected, coupled with the coronavirus, has stretched out the process. It <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/973e7e02-c100-44a4-b65d-c01839f0fe03\">will have to sell</a> <strong>Borsa Italiana</strong>, probably to Euronext for €4.3bn, but the LSE expects that to be done by the end of the quarter.</p> <p>And then, finally, the fees will be unleashed. Bankers, lawyers and other advisers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3370be7-d52c-46ff-b3fb-8a459804a850\">are set to divvy up</a> an enormous $1.1bn fee pool for work on the deal.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Intel </strong>has ousted chief executive <strong>Bob Swan</strong> following sweeping changes at the semiconductor maker by activist hedge fund Third Point. He will be replaced by <strong>VMware</strong> chief executive <strong>Pat Gelsinger</strong> next month. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6e30aca-e72b-4c49-8e8a-1bb25918c5c4\">More here</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>BlackRock</strong> co-founder <strong>Barbara Novick</strong> is retiring from the world's largest asset manager.
