  "title": "Retailers Embrace  Higher Inventories  ----  By Liz Young",
  "text": "<p>   While many retailers are discounting, canceling orders and otherwise scrambling to get rid of a glut of goods filling their stores and warehouses, some are embracing their higher inventory levels. </p><p>   Merchants including Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., Lowe's Cos. and Walmart Inc. say the rising stocks signal a recovery from last year's shortages driven by supply-chain disruptions and put them in a strong position to take advantage of consumer demand this holiday shopping period. </p><p>   \"We're really thrilled that we have in stock for Q4 inventory for the first time in a few years that's going to be robust,\" Lauren Hobart, chief executive officer of Dick's, said on an earnings call Nov. 22. </p><p>   Supply-chain experts say the shifting views of some retailers toward the growing stockpiles are a sign of the rapid changes in consumer markets this year, as sellers of apparel, appliances and sports equipment try to take advantage of resilient demand in some sectors. </p><p>   The companies are looking to ensure they have items on hand at the right moment, said Vishal Gaur, professor of operations management at Cornell University's SC Johnson College of Business. \"Oftentimes in retailing, customers face stockouts,\" Mr. Gaur said. \"If a customer is assured that the product will be available in their size, for example, in a retail store, then the customer is more likely to visit that store and to purchase the product.\" </p><p>   The tactic appears to have paid off. Real-estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. said its survey of 13 malls and outdoor shopping centers it manages across the U.S. found no problems with shortages during Black Friday this year. Discount retailers Burlington Stores Inc. and TJX Cos. are among those happy to stock up as other merchants look to off-load goods. </p><p>   Burlington's inventory in stores was up 8% at the end of the third quarter on a comparable store basis compared with the same period last year. CEO Michael O'Sullivan said he expected that to increase over the holiday period. \"Last year, our store inventories were just too lean going into the spring,\" Mr. O'Sullivan said on a Nov. 22 call with analysts. </p><p>   TJX, which operates brands including T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls, said inventory was up 26% in the third quarter compared with last year. But the retailer said that big jump left inventory turnover and markdowns in line with prepandemic levels and that it plans to keep stocking up. Home-improvement goods seller Lowe's plans to build its inventory this quarter by ordering goods earlier than usual to be prepared for events beyond the holiday period, said Brandon Sink, the company's chief financial officer. </p><p>   The overall retail sector's ratio of inventories to sales, a measure of how much companies have in stock compared with what they sell, remains tight by historical standards. The most recent Census Bureau data show the ratio was at 1.25 in September 2022, compared with 1.47 in September 2019. </p><p></p>",
