  "title": "Even Walmart Deserves a Trial; A judge wants to hold pharmacies liable for opioid prescriptions they were obligated to fill.",
  "text": "<p>Pharmacies are and should certainly be responsible when they mess up. Say Dr. Jones prescribes rosuvastatin (a cholesterol reducer) to Mary, but the pharmacist reaches for the wrong jar and instead dispenses Valium (a benzodiazepine). Valium and alcohol have synergistic effects, so if Mary goes to a bar, she may forget how many drinks she's had and how many pills she's taken. If she overdoses, has respiratory failure and dies, the pharmacy must pay. Or imagine that John, a high-school freshman, impersonates Dr. Jones, calls in a prescription for pain reliever Vicodin (a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone), and gives his own phone number as a callback for confirmation. The staff pharmacist fails to check in the physician directory, and fills the prescription. John's liver fails. The pharmacy must pay.</p><p>In both cases, the pharmacy dispensed a drug that wasn't legally prescribed. But in the bellwether trial set to begin in October, a broader ground of liability is being advanced. Attorneys for Ohio's Lake and Trumbull counties are suing four pharmacy chains—CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Giant Eagle—for damages they allegedly caused by filling \"too many\" opioid prescriptions.</p><p>The trial will be the first test case of multidistrict litigation overseen by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster in the Northern District of Ohio. An MDL case groups together federal cases (often class actions) from across the country that present common legal and factual issues for more-efficient handling by one judge. That judge typically prepares one or more bellwether cases he or she thinks are typical of those in the MDL. This gives everyone involved a better sense of whether it's worth continuing the litigation. Judge Polster was assigned the opioids MDL, in which manufacturers, distributors, pharmacists and physicians have been sued. He has singled out the pharmacies for his test case.</p><p>Note that the MDL plaintiffs in next week's case aren't the users of the medicines. They are two local governments that have spent money to confine and treat opioid addicts. Twisting old case law that held polluters of city streets liable, these governments claim that the presence of too many opioids in the counties constitutes a \"public nuisance.\" Plaintiffs have reached settlements with several major pharmaceutical manufacturers, which were plausibly accused of creating the \"nuisance\" by fraudulently understating the addiction risks of opioids, thereby tricking regulators and physicians into approving the drugs and writing prescriptions.</p><p>But pharmacy chains vigorously deny any such misfeasance and argue that they would have been legally vulnerable had they refused to dispense a prescribed drug. The chains maintain that outlaw drug gangs, pill mills and cheaper synthetic opioids (typically smuggled in from Mexico) have fueled the opioid epidemic. None of those criminals are being sued.</p><p>Judge Polster has been adamant that the pharmacy chains should settle these suits. He seems frustrated that all have declined to do so, other than Rite Aid. At a hearing in March, the judge told lawyers that the chains would be bankrupted by jury awards, though he failed to specify the legal theory holding them liable. \"I can't imagine that the defendants' strategy is to try hundreds of these. I mean, if that happens, the only one left will be Walmart,\" he said. \"There will be a monopolist.\" He added that he \"could see why\" Walmart wants a trial, but not \"why the others would.\"</p><p>Walmart, by the way, fills less than 4% of prescriptions in the two Ohio counties, where CVS has 14 outlets and Walgreens 13. The chains note that prescriptions with \"red flags\"—forgeries, massive over-prescriptions from the same doctor, other warning signs—generally come from small, independent pharmacies that are in cahoots with \"pill mills.\" Judge Polster nevertheless decided to restrict next week's test trials to the major chains, stating that \"I don't think you should be cluttering these trials up with too many defendants.\"</p><p>This isn't an appropriate attitude for a judge to hold. Due process requires that judges apply the law, not that they solve social problems by essentially taxing selected companies. Several of Judge Polster's pretrial rulings, including one that purported to impose a \"negotiating class\" precommitted to a settlement, have already been overruled by the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Pharmacies must be allowed to show that they have not misbehaved, even if plaintiffs' lawyers prefer they give up without a fight.</p><p>Mr. Krauss is a professor emeritus at George Mason's Scalia Law School and author of \"Principles of Product Liability.\"</p><p>Even Walmart Deserves a Trial</p>",
