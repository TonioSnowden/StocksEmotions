  "text": "<p>Good morning. Motorists in the US will be cheering the news today that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c0c67b7-6e7d-41e2-846c-e0770fa8661c\">average price of a gallon of gasoline has dropped to $3.99</a>, tumbling from a record high of more than $5 in mid-June, according to AAA. </p> <p>Cheaper US petrol has helped to rein in high inflation. Data on the Consumer Price Index showed that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d0cc752-9e65-45aa-8fc2-de0999cf632d\">inflation rose 8.5 per cent in July</a> from a year earlier, a slower uptick than had been expected, and a lot lower than the June rise of 9.1 per cent. </p> <p>Signs that the world's biggest economy could be past the peak of super-hot inflation offered some comfort to the Federal Reserve, which has been on a campaign to cool price surges by raising interest rates. </p> <p>But Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco branch of the Fed, said it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0aae2c99-69f1-49d8-bfab-0599add9e491\">not enough for a victory lap</a>. Inflation is still way above the bank's 2 per cent target rate, and “core” prices — which strip out volatile items such as energy and food — rose in July at an unchanged pace of 5.9 per cent year on year. Daly told the Financial Times that another rate rise in September was still on the table. </p> <p>The prospect of lay-offs is also giving policymakers a headache. From Netflix to Walmart, businesses have warned of job cuts even as, a little confusingly, unemployment has dropped to a record low. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4aef93-f8d7-472c-aef9-fb71f576a10d\">Why are so many jobs under threat?</a> </p> <p><em>Thanks for checking in with FirstFT Americas today, see you tomorrow — Georgina</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.
