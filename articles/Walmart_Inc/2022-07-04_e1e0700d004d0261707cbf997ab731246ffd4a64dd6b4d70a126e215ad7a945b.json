  "title": "Our Recession Forecasting Model Is Broken; There might be a recession soon, but trying to predict it using our pre-Covid-19 toolbox is silly",
  "text": "<p>The pandemic brought about major distortions to the economy and, though worries about Covid-19 have been waning, many of those distortions remain. There are still fewer jobs in the U.S. than before the pandemic struck, but because many people still haven't returned to the workforce, the unemployment rate is near its lowest level in more than 50 years. Reduced spending and government relief allowed households to accumulate savings like never before. Federal Reserve figures show that holdings of cash and cash equivalents were 30% higher in the first quarter than two years ago.</p><p>Spending patterns remain out of whack too. Even though more people are engaging in activities such as travel and dining out, with a correspondingreduced appetite for stuck-at-home wares such as sofas, Commerce Department figures show that spending on long-lasting durable goods as of May was 18.8% higher than in February 2020, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal swings. Spending on services was up by just 0.6%—not enough to keep up with population growth. If you want an indication of just how messed up spending still is, take a look at what is happening in dentists' offices: Adjusting for inflation, spending on dental services in May was 11.3% below its February 2020 level.</p><p>With everything looking so different, trusting too much in recession models, which are based on how the economy behaved going into previous downturns, is problematic. Consider a New York Fed forecasting model, which now puts the chances of a recession occurring over the next 10 quarters at about 80%. It uses a variety of inputs, including gross domestic product, which contracted at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter, and gross domestic income, which theoretically should be the same as GDP, but grew by 1.8%. It also includes a measure of productivity, which, with all the supply-chain issues and labor-market shifts the economy has been going through, is even harder to assess than usual.</p><p>Notwithstanding economist Paul Samuelson's famous quote about the stock market forecasting nine of the past five downturns, the bear market in stocks has probably upped many investors' estimated recession probabilities. One particular problem with that now, however, is that many of the pandemic's big winners—producers and sellers of goods, companies such as Netflix, etc.—are overrepresented in the stock market relative to the economy. So shifts away from pandemic categories are mostly registering as a bad thing, while many of the beneficiaries don't get as much notice. There is no Walmart of dental services.</p><p>Industries focused on the production, transportation and selling of goods, such as manufacturers and construction firms, truckers and retailers, also throw off a lot more economic data than many services-focused industries, in part because it is easier to do things such as count freight-car movements than to count the lines of code the nation's programmers produce. Typically, this isn't a problem for economists, because even though services are a bigger part of the economy, they aren't as volatile as goods sectors, which drive ups and downs. But services got crushed by the pandemic. To the extent that more spending is moving back toward them, the goods focus in the economic data creates a blind spot that could be flowing into recession models.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you think the U.S. will slip into a recession? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>There are also a number of recession indicators that aren't flashing red. For example, the yield curve—the difference between short- and long-term interest rates—is still positive, with 10-year Treasury yields 1.225 percentage points higher than rates on three-month bills. As of the end of May, a New York Fed yield-curve model put the probability of a recession occurring over the next 12 months at just 4.1%. Continued claims for unemployment benefits remain near lows not seen since the 1960s, whereas they tend to rise significantly ahead of downturns.</p><p>But with the economy looking so much different than it used to, putting too much faith in such all-clear signals also seems problematic. Surely with the Fed raising rates in an attempt to cool inflation, the risk of recession has to be higher than it was a year ago. A downturn could still be on the way, and by the time it is obviously coming, it might already have arrived.</p><p>Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com</p><p>Our Recession Forecasting Model Is Broken</p>",
