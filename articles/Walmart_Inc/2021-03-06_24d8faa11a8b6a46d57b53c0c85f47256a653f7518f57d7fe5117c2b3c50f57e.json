  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  In the cutthroat world of grocery retail, it takes a lot to keep investors around. </p><p>\n  Tough year-over-year comparisons for both Kroger and Costco will begin next time they report quarterly earnings, when results will be compared with sales starting in March of last year, which benefited from pandemic-era stockpiling and cooking at home. </p><p>\n  For now, the numbers still look good. In the quarter ended Jan. 30, Kroger's total revenue grew 6.4% compared with a year earlier. Costco increased its top line 15% from a year earlier in the quarter ended Feb. 14. </p><p>\n  Both retailers are continuing to benefit from higher sales of fresh produce, with Kroger pointing out that fresh-item sales outperformed other categories. Costco said on a Thursday earnings call that strong sales of fresh foods drove its profitability the most, aided by increased labor productivity and lower spoilage. Some of this will likely reverse as life gets back to normal and consumers shift their spending to restaurants and travel. But other sources of revenue such as fuel and food-court sales should bounce back. </p><p>\n  While Costco hasn't provided guidance for 2021, Kroger said it expects comparable-store sales excluding fuel to decline 3% to 5% in the fiscal year ending around January 2022. Walmart similarly gave lukewarm guidance last month, saying it expects comparable sales to increase at a low-single-digit rate this fiscal year. </p><p>\n  But it is important to note that many of these retailers were able to cram years of efficiency gains into a few quarters because they suddenly had to handle much higher sales volume -- both in-store and online. Kroger, for example, said profitability for online sales is improving because of technological and process improvements, as are profits from its media business, which earns ad dollars from online sales. In addition, a lot of operating expenses specific to Covid-19, such as cleaning protocols and employee benefits, are going to go away eventually, which should help bottom lines in future quarters. </p><p>\n  What seems clear is that these companies have learned to run their operations more efficiently today than a year ago. There should also be at least semi-permanent market-share gains from small competitors closing down and more consumers learning to cook. Their stock prices don't reflect that. Both Kroger's and Costco's shares trade at lower multiples of forward earnings than they did a year ago. </p><p>\n  Growth is important, but investors shouldn't discount the strength of a well-run business. </p><p></p>",
