  "text": "<p>Walmart WMT shares slipped on Tuesday despite the upbeat report.</p><p>See: ‘Fighting inflation is in our DNA': Walmart says its pricing and inventory can deliver for the holidays</p><p>“We are constructive on Walmart's 3Q results, especially comps +9.2%, and believe the retailer is early in its transformative ecosystem journey,” wrote Cowen analysts led by Oliver Chen.</p><p>“That being said, supply chain, inflation, and labor pressured margins, and will remain a headwind over the coming quarters.”</p><p>Analysts say they expect a “strong quarter” from the retail giant, with inventory up after actions taken to get around supply chain congestion, including chartering their own ships.</p><p>“We believe improving U.S. comps and the health of the U.S. consumer are key positives for the stock and believe top-line momentum is set to continue in FY22, driven by price investments and an improved store experience,” Cowen said.</p><p>Walmart is also expanding other areas of its business, like advertising through Walmart Connect, which is up 240% on a two-year basis, and Walmart GoLocal, the company's delivery service.</p><p>“Inflation will serve as a headwind to gross margins for the foreseeable future, butwe think advertising, marketplace, and other initiatives can provide significantoffset,” wrote KeyBanc Capital Market analysts led by Edward Yruma.</p><p>“Near-term conditions look favorable, but wallet share shifts (toward travel/experiences) may be a headwind in 2022.”</p><p>KeyBanc rates Walmart stock overweight with a $180 price target.</p><p>Also: Target blows past quarterly earnings expectations and says shelves are full for holiday season</p><p>Raymond James says Walmart is a long-term winner, but investors are watching closely for the impact that industry-wide challenges will have.</p><p>“On the negative side, we did sense some investor concern about SG&amp;A dollar growth (q/q and y/y),” analysts said.</p><p>“Admittedly, the growth was above our expectations and will likely remain a focus given the labor environment.”</p><p>Raymond James rates Walmart stock outperform with a $170 target price.</p><p>“We continue to believe that Walmart is under-earning relative to its potential,” wrote BMO Capital Markets in a note.</p><p>“And while there was progress on Walmart's higher-margin initiatives (Walmart Connect noted +240% 2-yr stack), it was difficult to see progress flow through in Q3, yet we believe investments through 2021 position Walmart well to continue balancing earnings growth and share gains.”</p><p>BMO rates Walmart shares outperform with a $170 price target.</p><p>Walmart stock has slipped 1.5% for the year-to-date, and has fallen 5.8% over the past three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 17.4% for 2021 so far.</p>",
