  "text": "<p>Shoppers spent more on everyday staples such as food and gasoline, but also on discretionary items including cars and restaurant meals—a sign of economic strength as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to cool the economy and bring down high inflation.</p><p>The October spending jump came ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Overall spending including services was strong in October.</p><p>Unlike many government reports, retail sales aren't adjusted for inflation and can reflect price differences in addition to purchase totals.</p><p>Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that retail sales declined 0.3% in November from the prior month. With autos removed from the picture, economists estimated that sales rose 0.1% in November.</p><p>\"It's a story of slowing momentum,\" said Rhea Thomas, senior economist at Wilmington Trust. She said spending on goods has slowed as consumers shift spending to services, a change from earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>Easing inflation could also be a factor. The consumer-price index rose 7.1% in November from a year earlier, a still high rate but slower than a 9.1% peak in June.</p><p>Energy prices, including gasoline, declined in November from the prior month. Other factors include discounting at stores because of high inventory levels and cooling prices for vehicles.</p><p>Consumers continue to benefit from a strong labor market and rising wages. Employers added 263,000 jobs in November, according to the Labor Department, and the jobless rate remained at 3.7%.</p><p>Marcus McNeil, 32 years old, said he is shopping for deals for his 2-year-old's gifts, as inflation eats into his wages.</p><p>\"I'm trying to work longer hours just to be able to give my son a decent Christmas,\" said Mr. McNeil, who works as a customer-service representative for a water-utility company in Homewood, Ill.</p><p>\"It's definitely not like Christmas last year or the year before—you could get a lot of items for your money. Now you have to be more selective,\" Mr. McNeil said. He added that he is trying to save money on grocery and heating bills by packing a sandwich for lunch and \"trying to bundle up and stay warm.\"</p><p>Large retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have noted a shift in consumer spending in recent months. Shoppers have given priority to spending on food and other necessities, more often forgoing spending on toys, furniture and other discretionary spending, said executives at those companies during earnings conference calls.</p><p>Costco Wholesale Corp. last week said sales growth slowed slightly in the most recent quarter compared with recent years as some shoppers bought fewer big-ticket discretionary items.</p><p>The retail-sales report offers a partial picture of consumer demand because it doesn't include spending on services such as travel, housing and utilities. The Commerce Department will release new household spending figures covering goods and services later this month.</p><p>Some consultants and industry groups have predicted slower sales growth for the overall holiday season compared with last year. The National Retail Federation, a trade association, estimates that the holiday shopping season—which encompasses November and December—makes up about a fifth of annual sales for retailers.</p><p>Bank of America last week said spending by consumers using its credit and debit decreased in November compared with the prior month, particularly on gasoline, online shopping and home improvement.</p><p>Still, its card data showed consumer spending on leisure services such as air travel outpaced spending on durable goods in recent months, suggesting consumers are giving priority to experiences over physical gifts this holiday season.</p><p>Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Retail Sales Fell Sharply in November</p>",
