  "text": "<p>The retailers say they are using the information to promote their stores and services, tailor marketing and keep in touch with consumers. The companies also say the information is critical in streamlining vaccinations and improving record-keeping, while ensuring only qualified people are receiving shots.</p><p>\"Every one of these customers is coming through our digital front end, so we have their email, we have their text message, and we have the ability to communicate with them regularly,\" said Jonathan Roberts, CVS chief operating officer.</p><p>CVS executives say they plan to stay in touch with vaccine recipients beyond receiving their second shot and use information gleaned in the process to better market to them. The company said about eight million people who received coronavirus tests from the chain hadn't filled a prescription at a CVS in the previous year, signaling that Covid-19 services promise to bring in new customers. A CVS spokesman declined to comment on the chain's use for marketing purposes of medical information gleaned through the vaccine process.</p><p>CVS is among the retail pharmacy and grocery chains that are participating in a federal program started last month to deliver vaccines directly to thousands of pharmacies in an effort to speed the pace of vaccinations. Shares of CVS, which owns insurance giant Aetna, and Walgreens rose 6% when the program was announced.</p><p>The ability to connect digitally and amass data on people who wouldn't otherwise be customers provides a benefit to companies, which aren't likely to see a financial windfall from their role in vaccinating the U.S. masses against Covid-19.</p><p>Shots are given at no cost to the public and are covered by the government. Pharmacies can bill insurance for administrative expenses which go toward covering labor, logistics and other costs involved in inoculations.</p><p>Retailers are taking varied approaches.</p><p>Anyone receiving a vaccine at Walmart must set up a patient profile in the company's online system, adding legions of new customers to those rolls.</p><p>Midwest chain Hartig Drug Stores is analyzing data on what people buy when they come to receive vaccinations, said Chief Executive Charlie Hartig. The company has also provided talking points for staff to highlight ibuprofen, ice packs and other aftercare items that people can use after getting their shots.</p><p>\"We encourage the products we have in the store and encourage [customers] to purchase those,\" Mr. Hartig said, adding that the vaccination process is already bringing in new customers.</p><p>Walgreens requires visitors to its website sign up for a Walgreens account to search for open appointments. In doing so, people get marketing emails that they may opt out of receiving, and agree to let Walgreens \"automatically collect information about you and your use of the Services, including without limitation, your real-time location, MAC address, and IP address.\"</p><p>A Walgreens spokeswoman said the data \"helps us better understand our customers, meet changing needs and continue to enhance and deliver the tailored solutions that we have been known for throughout the pandemic.\" She said medical data isn't used for marketing purposes.</p><p>Neither CVS nor Walgreens requires members to sign up for loyalty programs, which track purchases, to register for a vaccine.</p><p>The core federal law protecting disclosure of health data known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, prohibits disclosure of protected health information for marketing purposes without the patient's approval, with few exceptions.</p><p>---</p><p>Anna Wilde Mathews and Jaewon Kang contributed to this article.</p>",
