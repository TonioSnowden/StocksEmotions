  "text": "<p>Walmart Inc. and Kohl's Corp. were sued by the Federal Trade Commission for falsely saying sheets, pillows, towels and other products were made of bamboo and were environmentally friendly, when they were actually made of rayon, a synthetic fiber.</p><p>The FTC said only products made from bamboo fiber can be labeled as bamboo. Rayon, which can be made from bamboo, has to be sold as \"rayon made from bamboo.\" The FTC said hazardous chemicals are used to make rayon, which pollutes the air.</p><p>\"False environmental claims harm both consumers and honest businesses,\" Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau, said in a statement Friday. \"Companies that green wash can expect to pay a price.\"</p><p>Walmart agreed to pay $3 million to settle the lawsuit, the FTC said, and Kohl's agreed to pay $2.5 million. The FTC said the civil penalties paid by the retailers were the largest related to bamboo marketing.</p><p>A spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart said the company takes the claims seriously and has worked to strengthen its product description programs.</p><p>Kohl's, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., didn't respond to a request for comment Friday.</p><p>The FTC said it has been warning Walmart and Kohl's to check its products and marketing for bogus bamboo claims since 2010.</p><p>As part of the settlement, both retailers have to stop saying a product is made of bamboo and is environmentally friendly, unless they can prove it.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>FTC Says Walmart, Kohl's Sold Bogus Bamboo Sheets, Pillows and Towels</p>",
