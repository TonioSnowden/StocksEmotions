  "title": "DoorDash Shares Surge on Revenue",
  "text": "<p>The continued strength of food delivery and its expansion into new segments led DoorDash to forecast the total value of orders on its platform to grow to as much as $50 billion in 2022 from about $42 billion in 2021. The estimate is in line with the consensus for 2022 from analysts surveyed by FactSet. DoorDash shares closed at $94.89 Wednesday, down about 50% from where they closed in their December 2020 trading debut.</p><p>The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash while accustoming consumers to the ease of convenience at the touch of a button. DoorDash capitalized on this shift and expanded its offerings to deliver everything from groceries to alcohol and pet food. It also expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed directly on retailers like Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc.'s websites.</p><p>DoorDash's expansion into new categories is a play to drive up customers' order sizes and improve retention, Chief Financial Officer Prabir Adarkar said. \"You have more reasons to engage with DoorDash,\" he said, adding that the company wants to save consumers the hassle of visiting multiple stores but still wants their spending habits on the app to \"mimic your behavior in your everyday life.\"</p><p>While DoorDash beat revenue projections in the fourth quarter and in 2021, its loss and adjusted earnings fell short of forecasts.</p><p>Mr. Adarkar said the bottom line was affected by the company's investments in new categories and in expanding overseas. DoorDash expanded into Japan and Germany last year and agreed to purchase Finland-based food-delivery startup Wolt Enterprises Oy late last year, a deal expected to close in 2022.</p><p>DoorDash's loss widened to $468 million last year from $461 million in 2020. But it trimmed its fourth-quarter loss to $155 million from $312 million in the corresponding 2020 quarter, when its bottom line was saddled by costs tied to its initial public offering.</p><p>One reason DoorDash can invest in growth is because the company has been profitable on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for more than a year.</p><p>Companies point to this metric to signal the strength of their underlying business. These adjustments strip out expenses such as asset write-downs.</p>",
