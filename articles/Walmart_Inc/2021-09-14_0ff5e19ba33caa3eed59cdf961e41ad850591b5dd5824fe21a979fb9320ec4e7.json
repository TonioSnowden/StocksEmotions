  "title": "Walmart  Talk Lifts  Litecoin  Briefly  ----  By Paul Vigna and Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   The price of litecoin, a little-used cryptocurrency, spiked in early trading Monday before falling back, after a news release touting a partnership with retailer Walmart Inc. turned out to be fake. </p><p>   Litecoin traded as high as $231, up 30%, after the issuance of the release via GlobeNewswire at 9:30 a.m. ET. The cryptocurrency quickly fell after Walmart said the news release was fraudulent. </p><p>   The news release, purportedly from Walmart, claimed the retailer would allow customers to make payments with the cryptocurrency. Walmart shares fell 83 cents at $145.06. </p><p>   \"The press release is not authentic,\" said a Walmart spokeswoman. Walmart doesn't accept cryptocurrency as payment in the U.S., she said. </p><p>   Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said the release wasn't connected to the cryptocurrency or the Litecoin Foundation, a nonprofit that manages it as a software project. \"Yeah, it's fake,\" he said. \"Don't know who created it.\" </p><p>   The Litecoin Foundation's social-media manager was fooled by the fake release, Mr. Lee said, and retweeted it from the foundation's Twitter account. </p><p>   \"He thought it was real, too,\" he said. \"It was wrong to retweet it. We deleted it quickly afterwards. But the damage is done.\" </p><p>   Mr. Lee created litecoin in 2011 as an alternative to bitcoin, taking the latter's code and tweaking it to create a digital currency with lower fees and faster confirmation times. </p><p>   It has been one of the more well-known cryptocurrencies but never grew into much more than a curiosity. With a market value of about $11.9 billion, litecoin is the 16th-largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap. </p><p>   GlobeNewswire issued a written statement that \"journalists and other readers should disregard the news release.\" </p><p></p>",
