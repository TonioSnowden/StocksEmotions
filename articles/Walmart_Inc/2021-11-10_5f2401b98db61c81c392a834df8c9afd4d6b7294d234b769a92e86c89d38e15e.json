  "title": "Business News: DoorDash to Buy Finland Startup",
  "text": "<p>DoorDash said Wolt's co-founder and chief executive, Miki Kuusi, would lead DoorDash's overseas presence after the deal closes, which the companies expect in the first half of next year. Helsinki-based Wolt employs 4,000 people across 23 countries.</p><p>The merger sets up DoorDash, the biggest food-delivery app in the U.S., to compete with Uber Eats in Europe. DoorDash has sought to expand overseas after capturing a lion's share of its home market during the health crisis. It considered a deal with a German grocery-delivery business earlier this year, but talks fell apart, according to people familiar with the matter. DoorDash expanded into Japan in the second quarter and will have a presence in 26 countries after the Wolt merger.</p><p>For us, this is \"accelerating the state of play on a bigger, global stage,\" Chief Executive Tony Xu said in an interview.</p><p>Wolt isn't a market leader in Europe, but Mr. Xu said he found the merger attractive because the startup has grown in what he considered a more cost-effective way compared to its peers.</p><p>Wolt co-founder Mr. Kuusi said the company will continue operating under its brand in the countries that it currently operates in. Messrs. Kussi and Xu wouldn't say how the combined entity would be branded in the countries it expands into.</p><p>Food delivery, already an expensive logistical undertaking, became costlier as companies across the globe invaded each other's strongholds.</p><p>DoorDash shares surged more than 20% in after-hours.</p><p>San Francisco-based DoorDash announced the deal Tuesday in conjunction with third-quarter results. Revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 45% year over year to $1.28 billion, the company said, in line with the $1.18 billion average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The pandemic made consumers more accustomed to ordering goods at the touch of a button, and DoorDash expanded into delivering everything from toothpaste to Tylenol and alcohol. It expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed on the websites of retailers like Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc.</p><p>Although DoorDash hasn't posted an annual profit since its inception eight years ago, it was the only major U.S.-based food-delivery platform to turn a quarterly net profit last year during the pandemic.</p><p>The company posted a $101 million net loss during the third quarter compared with a $43 million loss a year earlier.</p><p>DoorDash has been profitable on an adjusted basis before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization for more than a year, giving it more leeway to expand overseas and build new business verticals without attracting the scrutiny that rival Uber drew after posting hefty losses along the way. The company's profit, by that measure, was $86 million in the latest quarter, on par with the prior year.</p>",
