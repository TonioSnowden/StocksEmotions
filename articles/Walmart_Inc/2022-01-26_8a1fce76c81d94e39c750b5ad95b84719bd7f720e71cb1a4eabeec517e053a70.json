  "text": "<p>The mask giveaway, announced Jan. 19, is similar to President Biden's decision to providefour free Covid-19 testsper U.S. household for those who want them. They are part of the federal government's stepped-up response to a nationwide surge in Covid-19 casestriggered by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.</p><p>Here is what you need to know about the free masks:</p><p>When can I get my free N95 masks?</p><p>Some providers are already giving out masks, the White House said, after the first shipment went out last week. All participating providers should be stocked up by the first week of February.</p><p>Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website to see a state-by-state breakdown of vaccine program participants.</p><p>Where can I get the masks?</p><p>Nearly all of the pharmacies and community healthcare centers that participated in the government's free vaccine program have agreed to be pickup points for the free mask program, according to the White House. This means most major chains, such as Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS, will have them, along with many independent locations.</p><p>Rite Aid anticipates the free masks to be in some of its stores this week, a spokeswoman said, with all stores offering the masks by early February. CVS said it expects its masks to follow the same timeline. A Walgreens spokeswoman said its first stores to offer masks would have them available on Jan. 28, and \"will continue on a rolling basis in the days and weeks following.\"</p><p>Masks will be available in more than 5,000 Walmart stores and Sam's Clubs around the U.S. by the second week of February, a Walmart spokeswoman said.</p><p>Hy-Vee pharmacies in the Midwest began distributing masks at some locations on Friday. All 275 Hy-Vee pharmacies in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin will have masks by midweek, a company spokeswoman said.</p><p>Meijer stores have also received shipments and are handing out masks in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Wisconsin, according to the White House. Southeastern grocery stores such as Fresco y MÃ¡s, Harveys Supermarket and Winn-Dixie will get masks by the end of this week, according to the White House, along with some of the federally qualified health centers participating in the program.</p><p>How will I know if my local store or pharmacy has masks to hand out?</p><p>Each mask shipment includes fliers and posters that participating pharmacies and health centers can display in their facilities to let customers know masks are available. Each flier has a QR code to scan for information on how to properly fit and remove an N95 mask.</p><p>Are the masks free?</p><p>Yes, they are free. You don't need to have insurance to get one.</p><p>How many masks can I get?</p><p>Each person can pick up three masks at a time, according to the White House. The masks are given out per person, so more than one person from the same household can get them.</p><p>Do I need to bring an ID with me?</p><p>No. No documentation of any kind is required to pick up masks.</p><p>If I need more, can I pick up extras?</p><p>Providers are handing out three N95 masks a day per person. The Biden administration has said there is ample supply and the program is meant to ensure broad access.</p><p>Will children-sized masks be included in the free program?</p><p>The Biden administration plans to start shipping high-quality masks for children in the near future. There are no certified N95 masks available yet in children's sizes.</p><p>What is an N95 mask?</p><p>The masks being offered are American-made, certified N95s that are part of the Strategic National Stockpile earmarked for emergency use.</p><p>N95 masks certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have a denser network of fibers than surgical or cloth masks. That tighter mesh, together with an electrostatic charge in the material, generally makes such masks the most efficient at trapping larger droplets and aerosols that are exhaled by the wearer.</p><p>They also better block such particles from being inhaled. Properly fitted, certified N95 masks can filter up to 95% of particles in the air.</p><p>How often can one be safely used?</p><p>Masks that are meant for single use can be worn more than once if there is a need, according to the CDC. But N95s shouldn't be worn more than five times, the agency said.</p><p>Write to Ginger Adams Otis at Ginger.AdamsOtis@wsj.com</p><p>How to Get Your Free N95 Masks From the U.S. Government</p>",
