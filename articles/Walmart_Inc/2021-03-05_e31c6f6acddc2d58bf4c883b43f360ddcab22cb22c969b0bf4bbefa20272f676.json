  "text": "<p>Aggreko looks set to become the latest British business to fall into the hands of private equity after the board of the mobile power specialist recommended a £2.3bn bid.</p> <p>Management, led by chairman Ken Hanna, said the offer of 880p a share from a consortium of I Squared of the US and TDR Capital of the UK was “an attractive price in cash that fairly recognises Aggreko's future prospects”.</p> <p>If the deal is agreed by shareholders, the company will join the growing list of UK-listed businesses taken private. </p> <p>More than 10 companies are in talks with private equity as the end of Brexit uncertainty and optimism over the vaccine rollout <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79e6ec3e-e869-4c77-beef-938c306ed7bc\">galvanises interest in London</a>, the worst-performing equity region last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It does seem a bit like a siege of London,” said one fund manager. Private equity, he added, “is on a completely different playing field, they can gear up massively with cheap capital”.</p> <p>TDR Capital only recently agreed a joint £6.8bn deal with Britain's Issa brothers to buy the Asda supermarket chain. I Squared Capital focuses on infrastructure. </p> <p>Their offer of 880p represents a premium of 39 per cent to the closing price on February 4, the day before the offer was made public to the market. The deadline to agree terms of a deal was 5pm on Friday. </p> <p>Shares in Aggreko were trading at 898.50p at lunchtime on Friday on hopes a rival bidder might emerge.&#xa0;</p> <p>Analysts at Peel Hunt said the offer for Aggreko was in line with expectations. </p> <p>Andrew Brooke at RBC Capital Markets, however, noted that “the shares are worth more”. </p> <p>A takeout valuation of about 5.5 times 2022 operating earnings “is relatively low compared to other strategic deals whilst recovery and medium-term growth prospects look sound”, he said.</p> <p>Aggreko was spun off by Christian Salvesen, the shipping and logistics group, and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1997. The Glasgow-based company provides generators and cooling equipment for large-scale events such as the Ryder Cup and festivals, as well as for remote areas and industrial sites. </p> <p>Demand for its products, however, was severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Results this week showed that pre-tax profits before exceptional items almost halved in 2020 to £102m, although the company said it was “encouraged” by signs of recovery in its markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>Analysts said the new owners would be able to help Aggreko manage the energy transition towards net-zero emissions faster.&#xa0;</p> <p>Adil Rahmathulla, of I Squared Capital, said: “Repositioning Aggreko fast enough to truly capitalise on these trends and rapidly shifting customer demand requires significant investment in clean technology and a step change in the pace of transformation.”<br></p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer and Oliver Ralph 2021 'Power supplier Aggreko accepts £2.3bn private equity bid' FT.com 5 March.
