  "text": "<p>Paul Cheema has just put in another 12-hour shift for his convenience store in Coventry in the English midlands. Not behind the counter, but behind the wheel: driving his van to and from a wholesaler in Birmingham to buy stock that his suppliers have failed to deliver.</p> <p>His supply crisis has been caused by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d6b3be1-627e-4784-afc5-91da326cabdc\">shortage of lorry drivers</a>. Driven largely by Brexit, the issue has been exacerbated by high coronavirus rates, which forced many truckers who were still working to self-isolate after being exposed to a possible positive case.</p> <p>“At the weekend, we ran out of bread and milk,” Cheema told the Financial Times. “So, I got in the van. It's a pain, but we are here to serve our community and we need full shelves.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36a1520d-d487-4257-9f6c-b26bac745eb4\">Missing food staples</a> have become one of the most popular topics on <a href=\"https://c-talk.co.uk/\">C-Talk</a>, a nationwide forum Cheema set up for small store owners. “People are at breaking point,” he said.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.acs.org.uk/media\">Association of Convenience Stores</a> (ACS), a lobby group for the sector, described Britain's EU departure followed by the “pingdemic” as a “perfect storm”.</p> <p>The ACS and some UK employers are urging the government to exempt fully vaccinated drivers and shop staff from self-isolation if they are exposed to Covid-19 but test negative. That change is not planned until August 16.</p> <p>Cheema is a member of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3807b66-b7e4-11e8-bbc3-ccd7de085ffe\">Nisa</a>, a co-operative with 4,000 stores that was forced to cancel many deliveries last weekend because of driver shortages. </p> <p>Adrian Costain, who owns Nisa stores on Merseyside, has also resorted to stocking up at a cash and carry after Warburtons, the baker, stopped deliveries this week. “We are obtaining a much better service from our smaller suppliers,” he said.</p> <p>Warburtons did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Nisa said: “Across the UK, driver shortages and the need to isolate are impacting supply chains and the delivery of goods. We are in regular communication with our partners to keep them aware of any delivery changes.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Spar stores are also suffering. Wholesaler <a href=\"https://www.afblakemore.com/about-us/group-overview\">AF Blakemore</a>, which supplies more than 900 Spar shops, cancelled almost 10 per cent of its chilled orders this week to try to reset its network. It also reversed a decision to shut a warehouse in Hastings and improved drivers' conditions, according to a memo seen by the FT.</p> <p>Sarah Ellis, AF Blakemore's group marketing director, told the FT that the number of Britons holidaying at home had increased demand at its busiest time of the year.</p> <p>She said the disruption would be “short-term”, but called on the government to help. “Whilst the creation of Covid-19 test centres within distribution centres will benefit colleague availability, more action is required to help to alleviate driver shortages.”</p> <p>The Road Haulage Association said the UK was <a href=\"https://www.rha.uk.net/News/News-Blogs-and-Press-Releases/press-releases/detail/driver-shortage-rha-and-freight-industry-write-to-prime-minister-boris-johnson\">short of 100,000 drivers</a>, in an industry that usually employs about 600,000. </p> <p>Another problem is that fewer drivers are qualifying because tests were cancelled during the pandemic. Others have left the industry, after the government changed the IR35 rules to treat them as employees, rather than self-employed, which added to their tax bills.</p> <p>The government has rejected calls from trade bodies for the temporary readmittance of EU-based drivers until more British drivers can be recruited or trained.</p> <p>But one driver, who did not wish to be named, said the shortages were a culmination of years of declining wages and working conditions.</p> <p>“Wages have remained stagnant for 20 years. In fact, in many cases they have reduced, particularly since the influx of eastern European labour,” he said.&#xa0;“We are treated like labourers.”</p> <p>Even large supermarkets have reported sporadic shortages, with bulky but cheap products such as mineral water a particular problem. Some have had to provide incentives to help with recruitment — both Asda and Tesco are paying a £1,000 signing-on bonus to new drivers until the end of September.</p> <p>Department store John Lewis announced on Thursday that it would increase the salaries of its lorry drivers by up to £5,000 a year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, food is scarcer. Farmers and meat processors were missing 16.5 per cent of their normal workforce as a result of Covid-19 and Brexit, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said.</p> <p>As a result, the British Poultry Council said its members had made unprecedented production cuts. Most are producing 5 to 10 per cent less chicken than usual and 10 per cent less turkey, while Christmas turkey production is set to be down by a fifth.&#xa0;</p> <p>“UK food security will be hit with a double whammy of food inflation and being forced to rely on more imported food,” said Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the poultry trade group.</p> <p>Tom Bradshaw, NFU vice-president, said fruit and vegetable growers were also suffering from labour shortages. Many temporary agricultural workers from the EU have chosen not to work on UK farms, despite a pilot visa scheme for seasonal labour.</p> <p>About 65 per cent of these labourers were normally returnees from previous years, but this year only 35 per cent were returnees, he said.</p> <p>“There is huge inflationary pressure, with wages being a key driver. Trying to pass [added costs] up the supply chain is proving really difficult. There's a real pressure at farm level — margins are eroding and disappearing very rapidly,” Bradshaw said.</p> <p>A lack of transport forced one grower to send almost £500,000 of fruit to landfill in June, he added.</p> <p>The UK government said: “We recently announced a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests able to be conducted.”</p> <p>“We have also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys.”</p> <p><br><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d93a4d5-b9d6-4fed-a45c-e9416a7fc7b6\"><em>Lorry drivers need the voice of organised labour</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d93a4d5-b9d6-4fed-a45c-e9416a7fc7b6\"><em>From Trevor Hopper, Lewes, East Sussex, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Andy Bounds in Huddersfield, and Judith Evans and Jonathan Eley in London   2021 'Shop owners take the wheel after UK driver shortage hits supplies' FT.com 4 August.
