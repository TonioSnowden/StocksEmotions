  "title": "Verizon Teams Up With Netflix in Push to Become Streaming Middleman; Amazon, Apple and YouTube woo customers with streaming marketplaces",
  "text": "<p>The services that are part of Verizon's Netflix deal include NFL+ Premium, the National Football League's streaming service; NBA League Pass, which lets users watch some professional basketball games live; the meditation app Calm; the workout app Peloton; the language-learning app Duolingo; and AMC+, the main streaming service of AMC Networks Inc.</p><p>The promotion—a partnership between Verizon and Netflix—is the latest alliance that streamers and connectivity providers are forging as they try to attract and retain customers. It is part of an effort by several large companies to simplify how people manage myriad streaming subscriptions.</p><p>Streaming services available to and used by households across the U.S. have mushroomed, creating a dizzying mix of logins, bills and payment systems that customers must navigate. Many households are seeing streaming costs pile up as they pay for several services and are looking for ways to trim costs.</p><p>A recent J.D. Power survey of more than 1,000 people showed 60% of U.S. consumers had at least four streaming services, compared with 40% about two years earlier.</p><p>Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.-owned YouTube are trying to put themselves at the center of households' streaming-subscription purchases through marketplaces that typically earn a cut of subscription sales or ad revenue from the streaming services that they sell a la carte. They also gain insight into the customers subscribing to different services through their marketplaces and often control the direct relationship with customers.</p><p>In streaming service distribution partnerships and promotions, streamers generally receive a wholesale rate, and both parties share the expense of marketing initiatives. Platforms can also negotiate a cut of revenue from people who convert to being subscribers at the end of a promotion.</p><p>As part of its deal with Verizon, Netflix gets to find out which of the streaming services customers chose to pay for in order to get the free promotion. That information could, for example, give it a sense of demand for sports content among the new customers the deal brings in.</p><p>It is unusual for Netflix to participate in a promotion that requires people to subscribe to another streaming platform to get Netflix free of charge. The company is working to stoke subscriber growth, which has flatlined over the past year.</p><p>The streaming business has become increasingly challenging because it is easy for consumers to jump between services, giving streaming and entertainment companies an incentive to package services together in an effort to improve customer retention.</p><p>Walt Disney Co. has said its bundle of the streaming services it controls—Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu—helps keep customers longer than when people subscribe to services individually.</p><p>Earlier this year Paramount Global joined with Walmart Inc. to offer a Paramount+ subscription as a perk to customers of the Walmart+ membership program.</p><p>Wireless carriers have long offered streaming-service promotions to their customers as a perk. T-Mobile US Inc. offers free Netflix indefinitely to some of its wireless-plan customers as well as AppleTV+ and a year of Paramount+ to people on its top-tier cellphone plans. Verizon helped bolster the growth of Disney's streaming service when it launched in 2019 by offering wireless-service customers a year of free Disney+.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Are you more likely to subscribe as part of a streaming promotion? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Verizon's +play marketplace, which started earlier this year, offers access to a range of streaming platforms beyond the ones included in the Netflix promotion, including Disney+ and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max. Verizon has a range of commercial relationships and agreements with the various services within +play.</p><p>Verizon manages the billing relationship with customers, who then watch content on the respective streaming services to which they subscribe. Verizon has positioned itself as neutral because of its business model.</p><p>\"We don't own a content creator, we don't own a content-production company or network, we are a pure-play distributor here,\" said Erin McPherson, senior vice president and chief content officer at Verizon. The company plans to explore new kinds of streaming bundles in the future through +play, including putting together packages of video and nonvideo streaming services, she said.</p><p>Verizon said that the Netflix deal is available to about 30 million of its customers and that it plans to extend it to more subscribers over time.</p><p>Write to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.com</p><p>Verizon Teams Up With Netflix in Push to Become Streaming Middleman</p>",
