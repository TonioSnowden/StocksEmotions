Regulators have amped up the pressure with a widespread record-keeping investigation across Wall Street that is putting many bankers on edge.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yesterday DD's Ortenca Aliaj and the FT's Joshua Franklin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0caa0690-1020-40b8-83bf-1db27afe9ed6\">revealed</a> that <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> had removed a senior investment banker from his position after he was found to have used unapproved messaging applications with clients.&#xa0;</p> <p>The banker is <strong>Anthony Kontoleon</strong>, known as “AK” to colleagues, who had been at the bank for almost three decades. Kontoleon was Credit Suisse's global head of equity capital markets syndicate in New York.&#xa0;</p> <p>His departure has been a source of consternation for his peers. “People are terrified of this text messaging bullshit,” one banker at a rival company said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Banks have been forced to take the investigation seriously after <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> was compelled to pay $200mn in fines for failing to keep records of staff communications on personal devices.</p> <p>One person with knowledge of the matter said Credit Suisse hoped a high-profile departure such as that of Kontoleon would be seen by regulators as a clear sign that the bank was taking matters seriously.</p> <p>It isn't difficult to see why Credit Suisse might want to please regulators following a number of scandals, including its $5.5bn loss from <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong>'s collapse and investments in funds tied to <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's also no surprise that bankers at rival groups are feeling nervous. Who else will be on the line to show regulators the message has been received loud and clear?</p> <h1>KKR ‘barbarians' now say the worker is king</h1> <p>When <strong>KKR</strong> sold an Illinois-based garage door manufacturer for $3bn last month, the private equity firm locked in a return of 10 times its 2015 investment.</p> <p>It was a stunning result, which the firm hasn't hit since the 1980s, when founders <strong>Henry Kravis</strong> and <strong>George Roberts</strong> were hailed (and derided) as Wall Street's barbarians.</p> <p>But this time there's a twist: 800 employees at <strong>CHI Overhead Doors</strong>, including truck drivers and people who man assembly lines, got to join the barbarians' feast as well.</p> <p>For years, KKR has touted a programme under which it awarded equity, that supplements regular pay, to ordinary employees at its industrial portfolio companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ordinary workers at the company received a few thousand dollars in dividends during KKR's tenure. Now that it has been sold, a total of 800 employees will collectively net $350mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>KKR has helped start a non-profit group to evangelise employee ownership, signing up <strong>McKinsey &amp; Company</strong>, <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, and “others not previously celebrated for their humanity”, DD's Sujeet Indap <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffcf8e5f-99d2-4d61-a8c7-25b929ea4442\">writes in his column</a>.</p> <p>Private equity's interest in wellbeing and fairness comes amid pressure over the industry's labour policies, preferential tax treatment and business practices.&#xa0;</p> <p>The firebrand Democratic senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has even proposed a <em>Stop Wall Street Looting Act </em>which would make it much harder for a private equity firm like KKR to load a company with debt to finance an acquisition.</p> <p>Private equity has long bridled at the suggestion that their market-beating returns come largely from leveraging their portfolio companies to the hilt, insisting that they are actually much better at running them.</p> <p><strong>Pete Stavros</strong>, the KKR executive responsible for the CHI investment, insists on sharing the credit, as well as the financial spoils.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It's a huge collection of a lot of little things the workforce did; again they did it,” he told the FT. “They earned it, they made this company more than triple, almost four times their profits, and so shouldn't everyone participate? That's the simple philosophy.”</p> <h1>Thoma Bravo engineers a cut on its software deal</h1> <p><strong>Orlando Bravo</strong> hasn't been shy about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrlandoBravoTB/status/1529103309344165888\">tweeting</a> of the “new normal” in software investing where valuations and enthusiasm have become much more muted.</p> <p>His limited partners must wonder where his realism was a few months ago.</p> <p>Bravo's eponymous firm, <strong>Thoma Bravo</strong>, has struck two of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year. In April, there was <strong>SailPoint</strong>, bought for $7bn. And just a few weeks before that was <strong>Anaplan</strong>, taken out for $11bn.</p> <p>Both deals were agreed just before the massive sell-off in tech stocks accelerated. And undoubtedly both companies are worth far less than Bravo agreed to pay for them.</p> <p>Normally, buyers would be stuck if valuations moved down between signing and closing a deal. But that's where the lawyers come in.</p> <p>In an otherwise ordinary phone call between Thoma Bravo executives and the chief executive of Anaplan in May, the company told its future owners that it would need to pay out $137mn in employee bonuses, $32mn more than had been designated in the merger agreement.</p> <p>Anaplan said the job market was red hot and that the pay was unremarkable in the big picture and ultimately necessary for the company to grow.</p> <p>Still, Thoma Bravo's lawyers at<strong> Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> believed the overrun was a violation of the contract and might affect its ability to raise the financing to complete the deal.</p> <p>As DD's Sujeet Indap <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/117ebfdd-5d94-4cd0-9dc3-01de3c5c14c1\">described earlier this week</a>, Anaplan decided that a legal fight wasn't worth the headache and agreed to lower the purchase price by more than $400mn, or about 3 per cent.</p> <p>The parallels to Twitter are obvious, where <strong>Elon Musk </strong>clearly seems to feel badly about striking a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85436ff9-2c06-45be-bb4f-ac195b043d8a\">$44bn deal</a> for the social network and is agitating on the issue of bot and spam accounts a way to reopen negotiations.</p> <p>Thoma Bravo has tried to present itself as a co-operative, management-friendly partner for software entrepreneurs. Nickel-and-diming the Anaplan shareholders will cause future buyout targets to take notice.</p> <p>As for the institutions that have entrusted their billions with Bravo, they are probably feeling a little better about that choice.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>FedEx</strong> has <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-announces-actions-enhance-stockholder-123000236.html\">named</a> <strong>Amy Lane</strong> and <strong>Jim Vena</strong> to its board after activist pressure from hedge fund <strong>DE Shaw</strong>.
