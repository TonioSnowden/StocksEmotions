  "text": "<p>Greggs, the food-to-go chain, posted its first annual loss since it floated in 1984 as it highlighted plans to increase its estate by 1,000 shops and start a build-your-own-sandwich service.</p> <p>The company, known for its sausage rolls and buns, said on Tuesday that the Covid-19 pandemic had caused revenues to fall 30 per cent from record highs of more than £1bn in 2019 to £811m last year. It reported a £13.7m pre-tax loss, down from a profit of £108m in 2019.</p> <p>The loss was narrower than the £15m the company had previously forecast but Greggs said it would not reinstate its dividend until it was profitable enough to fund its investment programme.</p> <p>It opened 28 stores last year — a marked slowdown from its pre-coronavirus rate of about 100 annually — and said that it planned to take advantage of the number of empty sites coming on to the market at reduced prices in transport hubs, retail parks and central London following the struggles of the retail sector during the pandemic.</p> <p>The company has increased its overall growth target for its estate from 2,500 UK shops to 3,000 at a rate of about 100 net openings a year, although Roger Whiteside, chief executive, said this could be accelerated if attractive sites became available sooner.</p> <p>Greggs operates 2,078 stores in the UK and said that each additional store could create about 10 new jobs. The chain cut 820 jobs in November to reduce costs.</p> <p>The company has benefited from its rapid acceleration of pre-pandemic plans to invest more in its digital capabilities and delivery service. Delivery sales in the first 10 weeks of 2021, during which the UK has been in lockdown, increased to 10.6 per cent of overall sales, up from 5.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2020.</p> <p>Whiteside said he expected delivery demand to subside marginally when stores reopened but that in the long term, the channel would continue to grow.</p> <p>He added that Greggs was working on integrating its click-and-collect service into its app and was planning a build-your-own-sandwich menu via click-and-collect in reaction to people becoming “more fussy about their food”.</p> <p>The group is also targeting an expanded range of supermarket products through the Iceland chain and more concessions in Asda.</p> <p>Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said that while Greggs was “a thoroughly good business run by thoroughly decent people”, its market valuation had become “detached from reality” and that he did not expect it to return to 2019 earnings levels until 2023. </p> <p>Shares in Greggs are up 57 per cent since last year. They rose 5 per cent on Tuesday.</p> <p>The company said that sales so far this year had been “better than expected . . . given the extent of lockdown conditions” with overall revenues about 22 per cent lower than the same period last year.</p> <p>Greggs has taken government furlough support for its employees and business rate relief but paid back a £150m government-backed loan taken earlier in the crisis. It ended 2020 with net cash of £36.8m.</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock 2021 'Greggs posts first loss in 37 years as pandemic hits' FT.com 16 March.
