  "text": "<p>   New York and Illinois said they would adopt new federal guidelines on masking and social distancing for fully vaccinated people. </p><p>   \"We have to reopen, we have to reopen smart, we have to reopen with a cautious eye, but we have to get back to life,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. \"If you are vaccinated, you are safe.\" </p><p>   More than 42% of New York state residents have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>   Those individuals won't need to wear a face mask or socially distance in most business and public settings in the state starting Wednesday. </p><p>   But, in keeping with federal guidance, masks and social distancing will still be required at certain locations, such as on public transportation, in private businesses and in healthcare settings, said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. </p><p>   The new recommendations don't apply to unvaccinated individuals. </p><p>   Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued an executive order Monday aligning his state's policies with CDC guidance. </p><p>   \"I also support the choice of individuals and businesses to continue to mask out of an abundance of caution as this pandemic isn't over yet,\" said Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat. More than 36% of the state's population is fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. </p><p>   The CDC said Thursday that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance during outdoor or indoor activities. </p><p>   But the agency added that the fully vaccinated should continue to wear masks while traveling by plane, bus or train, and the guidance doesn't apply to places such as hospitals, nursing homes and prisons. </p><p>   The recommendations caught many local governments and businesses off-guard. </p><p>   Until Thursday, 26 states and the District of Columbia had statewide mask mandates still in place, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Almost all of those states have now updated their masking policies to follow the CDC's guidance either immediately or in short order. </p><p>   A handful of remaining states, including California and Massachusetts, said they were still reviewing the guidance. </p><p>   Mark Ghaly, secretary of California's Health and Human Services Agency, said Monday current Covid-19 health guidelines would continue until June 15, when the state will switch over to the new CDC recommendations. </p><p>   Dr. Ghaly said the four-week period would give Californians time to prepare for the changes and to get vaccinated. Some 38% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. </p><p>   \"In indoor settings outside of one's home, including public transportation and schools, face coverings continue to be required regardless of vaccination status,\" Dr. Ghaly said. </p><p>   Massachusetts also plans to wait to update its public-health recommendations. </p><p>   Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday the state's Covid-19 restrictions and capacity limits would be removed on May 29, and Massachusetts would adopt federal guidelines on masking and social distancing for fully vaccinated people in most settings. </p><p>   \"We're safer, smarter and better-equipped in this fight than at any time since it began,\" said Mr. Baker, a Republican. </p><p>   Nearly 47% of Massachusetts residents are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. </p><p>   Public-health specialists say the updated CDC guidance largely follows the increasing scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of the available vaccines and the current state of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. </p><p>   In recent weeks, nearly every key Covid-19 metric has been declining, and 59.7% of adults have received at least one vaccine dose. </p><p>   Yet the recommendations will be challenging to enforce in public settings, the public-health specialists say, and whether someone wears a mask likely will come down to individual compliance and local rules. </p><p>   The changes also will forced retailers and other businesses to rethink their policies. </p><p>   On Monday, CVS Health Corp. and Target Corp., said vaccinated customers weren't required to wear masks in stores, while Walmart Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. said last week they would drop the requirement for vaccinated shoppers. </p><p></p>",
