  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  CFOs Are Planning for Higher Minimum Wage  ----  By Mark Maurer",
  "text": "<p>   Finance chiefs are evaluating their options to offset potential higher costs as some lawmakers pursue legislation asking for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of a Covid-19 relief package. </p><p>   President Biden has said he supports a plan to more than double the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 over the course of four years. The federal minimum wage last changed in 2009, when it rose from $6.55. </p><p>   Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 could deliver pay raises for 27 million workers and lift 900,000 Americans above the poverty threshold, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated. It also said the policy could cost 1.4 million Americans their jobs. </p><p>   Various companies have said they support a federal minimum wage increase -- albeit not as high as $15 -- and a phased-in approach that gives them time to prepare. Many businesses are paying a minimum wage of $7.25 or more in some states in which they operate, but a nationwide increase would require more extensive preparations. </p><p>   Walmart Inc. and Starbucks Corp. in recent months announced plans to increase hourly wages to at least $15 for certain workers. Starbucks in December vowed to pay all of its roughly 230,000 U.S. employees at least $15 per hour over the next two to three years, up from more than 30% of workers who currently receive that amount. </p><p>   Five Below Inc., a Philadelphia-based discount retailer, plans to respond to potentially higher labor costs in part by continuing to increase the number of employee-assisted self-check-out stations, allowing more transactions to be completed, Chief Financial Officer Ken Bull has said. The company employs more than 15,000 people. </p><p>   An increase in the minimum wage could at the same time benefit the business because consumers might have more purchasing power, Mr. Bull said. \"Maybe we get dinged from an expense perspective, but we see our sales go up because there's more dollars in the economy,\" he said. </p><p>   Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Lakewood, Colo., operator of more than 60 burger-bar or fast-food locations, plans to raise prices of some menu options to offset a higher minimum wage, Ryan Zink, the company's chief executive and principal financial officer, said Feb. 9. </p><p>   The company is also considering investing in technology such as hand-held devices that would allow customers of Bad Daddy's Burger Bar to place their own orders and pay their own checks without any staff involved, Mr. Zink said. \"It will require change and for us to adapt our business model,\" he said. </p><p>   If the wage increase doesn't make it into the Covid-19 package, Mr. Biden is expected to push for additional legislation. Meanwhile, the 2022 elections could offer an opportunity for more states to put minimum-wage increases on the ballot. Eight states, most recently Florida, have approved an eventual increase to $15. Most states have set a minimum wage higher than $7.25 an hour, including a $13.69-an-hour rate in Washington state. </p><p>   1-800-Flowers.com Inc., a Carle Place, N.Y., floral-gift retailer, plans to automate more tasks in its manufacturing and distribution operations to become less reliant on its seasonal labor force, CFO William Shea said on a Jan. 28 earnings call. The company, which owns 15 e-commerce brands, has more than 3,300 year-round employees in seven U.S. states and employs temporary workers on top of that. </p><p>   The retailer already pays minimum wages close to the proposed rate in several states, so it doesn't foresee a significant impact from a federal increase alone, Mr. Shea said. \"Increased labor costs . . . are kind of here to stay,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
