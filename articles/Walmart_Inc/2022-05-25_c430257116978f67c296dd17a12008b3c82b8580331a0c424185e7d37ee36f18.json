  "text": "<p>Best Buy said on Tuesday that comparable-store sales in the U.S. declined 8.5% in its quarter ended April 30. That was better than the 10% decline analysts polled by Visible Alpha were expecting. But net income fell by nearly 43%, which was worse than the 37% drop Wall Street had estimated. The company lowered its sights for the year and now expects comparable sales to fall by 3% to 6%. About three months ago it was expecting a decline of 1% to 4%.</p><p>All in all, Best Buy's results are another indication that goods spending is shifting away from things that supported customers' homebound lifestyles during the pandemic. Categories that fared badly included computing and home theater, according to remarks by Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry.</p><p>But Best Buy's results also highlight the fact that good planning goes a long way. The company wasn't immune to some of the profit pressures hitting retail, including high supply-chain costs and more promotional activity (especially in TVs, something Target also flagged). Its operating costs, however, fell by about 5% compared with the year-earlier period -- a bigger drop than Wall Street expected. Notably, Best Buy's decision during the pandemic to reduce its head count and move to a flexible workforce model (under which employees can train to wear different hats on different shifts) seems especially prescient at a time when other retailers, such as Walmart, suffered big hits to their margins because of high labor expenses. Even though Best Buy's revenue expectations for the year are a lot worse than previous guidance, its operating margin is expected to slip only slightly: The guidance now calls for operating margins of 5.2% to 5.4% compared with a previous 5.4% view.</p><p>Two other details stand out. One is that appliance sales at Best Buy kept growing, even as Target last week flagged weakening kitchen appliance sales. Comparable-store sales of appliances in the U.S. increased 3% last quarter compared with a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting a nearly 6% decline. The right merchandise assortment and good service seem to go a long way. And while other retailers have seen ballooning inventory levels (Target's and Walmart's grew 32% and 43%, respectively), Best Buy's inventory expanded by a more modest 9% last quarter compared with a year earlier -- something Ms. Barry credited to active inventory management.</p><p>Best Buy's shares, which rose by about 1.2% on Tuesday, are still down more than 27% this year. That compares favorably with Target and Amazon. Best Buy can't do much to control the outside forces that are chipping away at consumer-goods spending, but it seems to be doing a much better job than others at controlling what it can.</p>",
