  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Retailers Move Faster to Update Shelf Prices",
  "text": "<p>\"There have been more times than not where we're almost just breaking even on products because of failure to be able to update the pricing,\" said Jeff Wachenfeld, who manages two True Value hardware stores on New York's Long Island.</p><p>Quicklizard Ltd., a company that sells software to help retailers automate their pricing strategies, said 75% of the roughly 100 retailers on its platform have increased how frequently they update prices in the past year, with nearly a third changing prices several times a day, up from 15% a year ago.</p><p>So-called dynamic-pricing strategies aren't new. Some large retailers, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., have been using the method for years to remain competitive with peers while protecting their margins. Travelers know that airplane fares can change with each web search. Gasoline-station operators have for years toggled between prices several times a day.</p><p>For grocery chains and hardware stores, shoppers expect prices to be more stable and are often sensitive to fluctuations. Frequent, or even daily, price changes aren't typical because they can be labor-intensive or require expensive technology.</p><p>Mark Griffin, president of B&amp;R Stores Inc., said his supermarkets have been changing grocery prices more frequently to protect profit margins as manufacturers raise prices. Many suppliers have gone from instituting one annual increase to several increases a year, citing higher costs for freight, materials and labor, he said. The Lincoln, Neb., supermarket chain is adjusting prices of roughly 3,000 items weekly, up from about 1,000 before the pandemic.</p><p>Adjusting prices is tedious work and can interrupt store operations, Mr. Griffin said, adding that some employees are working overtime to put in new tags. To save time, B&amp;R is trying electronic shelf labels at a store.</p><p>With wholesale prices rising so quickly, retailers that set their prices monthly or even weekly risk having their profits squeezed -- or look as though they are overcharging when prices come down.</p><p>\"It raises a red flag for me when contractors are buying me out of something in particular,\" such as PVC pipe, said Mr. Wachenfeld of True Value. \"Why is everyone buying this all of a sudden? It's because I'm way too cheap.\"</p><p>He has outfitted shelves in one of his two stores with digital price tags so he can update prices more often than once a month without the expense of manually printing and labeling for roughly 30,000 different products. The goal is to change prices weekly, he said.</p><p>Best Buy Co. and Kohl's Corp. have rolled out electronic price tags on their store shelves in recent years, making it easier and quicker to change the price on a display of television sets or a rack of blouses.</p><p>The online auto-parts retailer CarParts.com Inc. historically changed its prices two to three times a week. Now the company is shifting prices almost daily, said operating and finance chief David Meniane.</p><p>\"We do have that ability to be a little more flexible when it comes to pricing,\" Mr. Meniane said at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network Summit in mid-January.</p><p>---</p><p>Jaewon Kang and Chip Cutter contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
