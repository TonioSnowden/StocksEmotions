  "title": "Ultra-Competitive Repeat Winners Dominate at Local Fairs: 'I Don't Take Vacations'; The fair gets fierce: Blue ribbons, butter sculptures, rivalries and the occasional flipped chair",
  "text": "<p>The 65-year-old has won that title at the Clackamas County Fair every year since 1999, except for 2020 when the pandemic prompted the event's cancellation.</p><p>\"Obsessiveness\" explains his long-running success, he said ahead of this year's fair, which starts Tuesday. \"I don't think I'm the world's best gardener, but I outwork people when it comes to the competitions. I don't take vacations in the summer.\"</p><p>Super contestants like Mr. Smith are fixtures at fairs across the U.S., as common as fried dough, Ferris wheels and 4-Hers tending to heifers. Most fairs have regulars who dominate some contests year after year, said Marla Calico, president and CEO of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions, a Missouri-based trade association.</p><p>\"It's human nature that we like to win,\" she said. \"There's pride in winning those ribbons.\" There's often cash, too, but usually not much, she said.</p><p>The dozens of ribbons Linda Skeens snagged at the Virginia-Kentucky District Fair in June made her an internet sensation. Her feats included sweeping first, second and third place in such categories as cookies, savory bread, candy and embroidered pieces.</p><p>\"I just like to do it. I love sewing, making things. I love cooking and baking,\" said Ms. Skeens, 74. She appeared on NBC's \"Today\" show and was congratulated by a Walmart checkout clerk. But normal life has resumed in rural Virginia, she said: \"I'm back to being me. I'm cleaning my house today.\"</p><p>Sometimes competition gets the better of people. Deb Gruber recalls unseating a past winner of a Pennsylvania shoofly pie contest, then watching her flip a chair and storm out. Ms. Gruber, 60, who has won her share of baking showdowns, said the woman wrongly thought she was related to a fair official and had an unfair advantage.</p><p>\"I guess some people take it really to the edge,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Gruber met her best friend, Sharon Kurtz, through competitive baking. In January she cheered when Ms. Kurtz eclipsed 76 bakers at the Pennsylvania Farm Show to take the cake for best chocolate cake, a raspberry mousse delicacy for which she got $500. To qualify, contestants first had to win at a local fair.</p><p>The same eligibility rules apply to the Farm Show's apple pie and angel food cake contests, and Ms. Kurtz, 60, has won both of those, too. With each victory at the state level, she stopped entering locally in that category so as not to look greedy.</p><p>\"I think that'd be kind of rude to keep entering them,\" she said. \"I play till I win and then I'm done.\" Now that she has won all three, she said, \"I need a new hobby.\"</p><p>Samantha Snyder scored at the 2022 Farm Show, too. She dominated the Mushrooms Department with 10 first place prizes, including for shiitake, oyster and portobello, and mushroom centerpiece, all on behalf of her employer, To-Jo Mushrooms, Inc.</p><p>Then again, there was just one mushroom entrant this year: her.</p><p>\"When I came back [to work] I was like, 'We won first place in every category,' \" she said. \"Three days later, I told them we were the only ones to participate. Everybody got a good chuckle out of it.\"</p><p>One of Dianne Ragain's proudest moments at the State Fair of Texas was taking best of show for a pound cake made from her grandmother's recipe. Her more than 55 ribbons since 2017 also include first place for an armadillo-shaped butter sculpture. She said she often uses her late mother's recipes, and leaves ribbons at her grave.</p><p>Ms. Ragain, 63, said she keeps quiet about her plans before each fair, lest anyone pinch an idea. \"I'm very close to a lot of ladies that compete, but I don't tell any of them what I'm entering, or what I put in my stuff,\" she said. \"Never.\"</p><p>Patty Wentworth, 71, has a secret she doesn't mind sharing. The fudge she's had great luck with at the South Carolina State Fair? \"It's a microwave fudge. I can't believe I win on it, because it's just so easy,\" she said. \"I share that with people and they're like, are you kidding?\"</p><p>She estimates she has won 300 or so ribbons over 42 years and regrets not keeping count. \"I always felt like I didn't want to be obnoxious about it,\" she said. Records provided by the South Carolina State Fair dating to 2007 show that she has rung up 88 first or second place finishes in that period alone.</p><p>Chip Heinz, 72, uses a spreadsheet to track the mini-dioramas he has entered in the Washington State Fair since the 1990s. He keys in the dimensions, production time (typically more than 300 hours) and material cost ($610 one year) of the intricate creations, which he crafts from fiberboard, balsa wood and wood putty, and populates with clay figures.</p><p>Many years he has emerged as grand champion of the Doll Houses Division, pocketing $100. He likely would have more awards but for a rule that forces him to sit out a year after consecutive championships. Though he isn't eligible this year, he plans to display his latest piece, \"Lemonade Wars,\" depicting three kids with rival stands.</p><p>Mr. Smith in Oregon said he caught the fair bug from his grandmother at age 10. He has competed in fairs ever since, amassing so many prizes for flowers and produce that he devotes a room at home to the ribbons. He calls it the War Room.</p><p>He was named champion gardener in 1978 and several other times before his current streak began in 1999. He has also won the Floral Sweepstakes for most of the past 40 years.</p><p>If he repeats as champion gardener at the Clackamas County Fair by amassing the most points, he will receive a $50 gift certificate, plus $200 or so in prize money for crop-specific contests, he estimates. But he said money isn't the point.</p><p>\"It's become more than a competition,\" he said. \"It's a personal challenge just to see if I can put something out there that's relatively close to perfection.\"</p><p>His winning ways hit a nerve with some fellow entrants, though he is always quick to share his know-how, said Janet Davis, the Clackamas fair's agricultural crops coordinator.</p><p>\"Throughout the years we have had people come in and say, 'Oh, is my nemesis here yet?' \" she said. \"But everybody admires him. They look at his stuff and say, 'Well, yeah, it is the best.' \"</p><p>Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com</p><p>Ultra-Competitive Repeat Winners Dominate at Local Fairs: 'I Don't Take Vacations'</p>",
