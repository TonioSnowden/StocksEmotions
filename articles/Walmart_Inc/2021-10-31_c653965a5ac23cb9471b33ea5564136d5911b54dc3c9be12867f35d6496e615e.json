  "text": "<p>It's not about the decorations she puts up. Or the costume she dons. Instead, the longtime resident of Huntington, N.Y., a town on the north shore of Long Island, makes sure to go big on the sweets — literally. She will be offering full-size candy bars in place of the traditional smaller ones (be they “fun size” or miniature) associated with the holiday.</p><p>“It's more impressive. The kids love it,” she said.</p><p>Apparently, Thomas isn't alone. In recent years, a number of Americans have gone the full-size route in an effort to make a statement and attract those trick-or-treaters all at once.</p><p>And some who track the retail world or study consumer behavior say the bigger-is-better approach could be even more pronounced in 2021 given that the Halloween celebration is expected to be especially robust compared to the pandemic-hampered one last year.</p><p>The National Retail Federation expects Halloween spending to reach a record $10.14 billion this year, up from $8.05 billion in 2020. On an individual level, consumer spending is expected to reach $102.74 — the first time the figure has crossed into triple-digit territory.</p><p>While that consumer tally includes everything from costumes to decorations, candy is naturally a major part of the holiday buy.</p><p>Some candy retailers and manufacturers say the full-size-for-Halloween trend is definitely real.</p><p>“We have seen growth in full-size bars over the last few years,” said Costco COST in a statement from management, though the company noted “the majority of our Halloween sales continues to be in fun-size and mini-size candies.”</p><p>Walmart WMT also “did bring in more full-size candy bars for Halloween this year vs. last and we also brought all Halloween candy in earlier this year,” a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Hershey HSY, the candy company behind several iconic brands, including its signature chocolate bars, said that full-size offerings account for about 10% of its trick-or-trick-related sales. But the company couldn't say if that percentage has been increasing in recent years.</p><p>Anna Lingeris, a Hershey spokeswoman, notes that she was a supporter of the full-size-for-Halloween movement long before she worked for the industry giant.</p><p>When she was growing up outside Pittsburgh, her family recognized that it was an effort for trick-or-treaters to make it to their house because of its long driveway. So they decided Halloween revelers were deserving of something bigger.</p><p>Lingeris says she now continues the full-size tradition at her home (and, yes, she buys her own candy). It's all about the reactions of surprise and delight from the kids (and their parents).</p><p>“You just see it in their faces. It's like ‘Oh my God,'” said Lingeris.</p><p>One-upmanship in the neighborhood</p><p>There also could be a factor of one-upmanship for some households — meaning they may be going full-size to show up the others on their block, much in the same way some try to outdo their neighbors when it comes to Christmas decorations.</p><p>In that regard, Simon Holland, a resident of suburban Atlanta, recently issued this proclamation on Twitter TWTR: “Heard a rival dad is planning to hand out king-size candy bars for Halloween so now every trick or treater that comes to my house is getting a full rack of ribs.”</p><p>Holland, a professional comedian, concedes he was kidding about the ribs. But he does make sure to give out full-size candy — in part because he remembered the thrill of getting such as a kid. “The house that gave out full-size was always pretty top-notch. I aspired to do that when the time came,” he said.</p><p>In that way, social media could be fueling the full-size trend, says Craig Agranoff, who teaches marketing at Florida Atlantic University and runs his own marketing agency.</p><p>It's one thing for a full-size giver to gain a certain reputation in the neighborhood, he notes. But platforms like Facebook FB, Instagram and TikTok can reveal their generosity to the world — “Now, it's going to be on camera,” Agranoff said — and inspire others to jump on the big-candy bandwagon.</p><p>Which is not to say that bigger candy doesn't come with a bigger price tag. And it's for that reason that many households will continue to stick by the smaller trick-or-treat offerings.</p><p>Dawn Gutheil Tucksmith says she can get up to 700 trick-or-treaters in her Chatham, N.Y., neighborhood on Halloween. She can't fathom paying the added cost to switch from minis to full-size bars.</p><p>“I mean, we already spend a couple of hundred dollars” on candy, she said.</p><p>Still, the economic equation can depend on how many of those smaller candies you're doling out per trick-or-treater. A report on the Lifehacker website noted that the cost of a full-size bar works out to be only 30% more than three “fun size” ones.</p><p>“Buying full-sized candy certainly won't save you money, but it's probably cheaper than you think — and paying a little extra might be worth the glory the neighborhood children will bestow upon you,” the report noted.</p><p>Of course, there are dental and medical issues potentially connected to going big on candy for Halloween, particularly in a country dealing with a childhood obesity epidemic that has only worsened during the pandemic. (A new study from the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the percentage of 5-to-11-year-olds who are overweight or obese increased from 36.2% pre-pandemic to 45.7% today.)</p><p>Dr. Jun Tashiro, a pediatric surgeon who runs an adolescent weight program at NYU Langone Health in New York City, isn't necessarily worried about the full-size trend. He says children should be allowed to enjoy Halloween, but suggests that parents put aside much of the holiday candy stash — big and small bars alike — so that kids can eat it over time and perhaps receive it as an occasional reward.</p><p>“We can teach moderation,” he said.</p><p>See also: This is the best candy to hand out on Halloween — and the absolute worst</p>",
