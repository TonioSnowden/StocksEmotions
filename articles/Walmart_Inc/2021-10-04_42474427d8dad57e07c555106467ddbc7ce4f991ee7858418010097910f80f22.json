  "title": "U.K. Grocery Fetches $9.4 Billion  ----  By Ben Dummett",
  "text": "<p>   A consortium led by U.S. buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice won the bidding war for U.K. grocery chain Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC, an almost $9.4 billion bet that highlights the extreme lengths private-equity firms are willing to go amid a global deal frenzy. </p><p>   The CD&amp;R-led group emerged as the front-runner after outbidding SoftBank Group Corp.'s Fortress Investment Group LLC and its partners in an unusual one-day auction held Saturday to decide the victor. The U.K. Takeover Panel, a government arm that oversees deal making in the country, held the contest to end a monthslong standoff fueled by increased offers by each side. </p><p>   The winning bid represented a 61% increase in value compared with where Morrisons' shares traded before news of the bidding emerged. </p><p>   Based in New York and London, CD&amp;R, which has partnered with U.S. buyout firm Ares Management Corp. and an investment arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is paying GBP 2.87 a share, or equivalent to $3.89 a share. That just tops Fortress's offer of GBP 2.86 a share, according to a release by the Takeover Panel. </p><p>   Morrisons, as it is known by British shoppers, operates 497 supermarkets along with a network of cafes, and gas stations and convenience-store outlets. The retailer also has a wholesale operation that includes supplying groceries to Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Now and other online delivery services available in Britain. </p><p>    Joshua Pack, a Fortress partner, said, \"We will continue to explore opportunities\" in the U.K. A representative for CD&amp;R couldn't immediately be reached for comment. </p><p>   Pandemic-induced lockdowns spurred a tripling of Morrisons' e-commerce sales in its past fiscal year. Costs to meet that demand by adding additional capacity coupled among other Covid-19 related expenses, combined with a drop in fuel sales and the closure of the company's cafes during lockdown, offset much of that gain. </p><p>   The U.K. supermarket industry is highly competitive. Morrisons, founded in 1899, is the fourth-largest chain and faces stiff competition both from its larger rivals and German discounters Aldi and Lidl. </p><p>   That competition pushed U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc. in February to sell a majority stake of Asda Group Ltd., Britain's third-largest grocery behind industry leader Tesco PLC and J. Sainsbury PLC, to TDR Capital, a Europe-focused buyout firm, and U.K. entrepreneurs Mohsin Issa and Zuber Issa. </p><p>   The escalating sale price adds risk to the deal as the U.K. economy grapples with surging energy prices, staff shortages and supply-chain disruptions across the food sector. </p><p>   A chunk of Morrisons' long-term value lies in its real estate, where it owns the majority of its stores. While both the bidders have sought to emphasize their intention to invest in the core operating grocery business, a person familiar with the deal said unlocking value through selling or leasing the real estate was a crucial part of the calculation. </p><p>   In the Asda deal, TDR and Messrs. Issa are selling Asda's gas stations to EG Group, a U.K.-based operator of gas stations and convenience stores that the brothers and TDR control to reduce their risk. </p><p></p>",
