  "text": "<p>In 2018, I was talking to the boss of a UK retailer. It wasn't long after Tesco had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82ecfef6-0be1-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09\">hit with an equal pay claim</a>, arguing that the people who worked in stores — predominantly women — had been unfairly paid less than the mostly male workforce in the supermarket's warehouses.</p> <p>What did he think? His reaction was quite forceful: it was ridiculous. They were totally different jobs. Of course you couldn't compare the two. Of course this wasn't about gender.&#xa0;</p> <p>His view isn't unusual in my experience. And I suspect the history of equal pay could be roughly characterised as women being told they were asking ridiculous questions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Three years later (and five years after the first of this collection of cases was brought against the supermarkets) we now know one thing: you can compare these jobs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db023ca7-d9a7-4912-8f5e-ca64aeaa4bf7\">court victories in cases</a> against Asda and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9d7e1b2-4bc9-4a65-b3e6-094d807b3737\">Tesco have established</a> — on different points of law, in the UK and in Europe — that you can compare store and distribution centre workers for the purposes of examining equal pay for work of equal value. This is significant.</p> <p>First, the caveats: This is only part one of a three-stage legal process, which will take years.&#xa0;</p> <p>An independent expert will carry out an analysis of the value of each job, in terms of its skills and demands. Then the supermarkets can argue that factors other than gender explain the difference, such as working hours, location or length of service.&#xa0;</p> <p>Finally, if it gets that far, there is the question of what is owed: Leigh Day, the law firm behind these cases, puts the pay differential at about £2 an hour on average and the sums run into the billions across the cases, which include J Sainsbury, Wm Morrison and Co-op.</p> <p>Why do the recent decisions matter? Because, says veteran equal pay lawyer Stefan Cross QC, they have “killed off an argument that has been running for 40 years”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Asda finding was built on case law, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5b201da-a451-11e3-9cb0-00144feab7de\">predominantly from the public sector</a>, arguing that these jobs could be compared across different locations, based on technicalities about terms and conditions. Last week's Tesco finding cuts through that detail: if there is a “single source” responsible for equality, the jobs can be compared.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The fact that this is the private sector is important: there has been an element of “wishful thinking among large employers”, said Mary-Ann Stephenson of <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/\">the Women's Budget Group</a>, about whether all this applies to them. </p> <p>Regardless of the ultimate success of these cases, these decisions open up the potential for other legal claims, in both the private and public sectors.&#xa0;</p> <p>This may be a trickle rather than a flood. Apart from anything else, in today's business world predominantly female jobs and predominantly male jobs have often been segregated into different entities. Look at the so-called 5Cs of stereotypically female work — cleaning, catering, clerical, cashiering and caring — and ask yourself how often those are outsourced in large organisations.</p> <p>But these cases also have the potential to shift thinking, just as gender pay gap reporting did. Pay issues aren't just about men and women being paid differently for doing the exact same job (and it's amazing how many of the remarks made about these cases don't engage with the tiresome reality of how the law actually works).</p> <p>My colleague <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0bce654c-74bd-47eb-aed4-4c9a8e065467\">Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson wrote last week</a>, after Exxon's defeat to a tiny activist investor, that bosses should spend more time “thinking about where today's fringe opinions suggest tomorrow's mainstream will be”. This could be another example.</p> <p>About two-thirds of the gender pay gap can be “explained” by worker differences such as occupation or experience, according <a href=\"https://www.classlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/glassdoor-gender-pay-gap-study.pdf\">to a report by Glassdoor in 2016</a>, while about a third was “unexplained”, or indicative of potential bias. But feminist economists (and yes, that is a thing) would argue that just because something can be explained doesn't mean it can't reflect discrimination.</p> <p>Is it possible, just maybe, that society has undervalued the skills and demands of, say, dealing with difficult customers at a checkout or restocking freezer cabinets compared with having the physical strength to hoick crates around in a warehouse, because one is mainly done by women and the other by men? Or more broadly has the value assigned to skills of caring been underestimated compared with skills of, say, fixing, because of the typical gender profile of the workforce?</p> <p>Those are questions worth asking well beyond the supermarkets' C-suites.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:helen.thomas@ft.com\">helen.thomas@ft.com</a><br><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/helentbiz\">@helentbiz</a></p><p>Source: Helen Thomas 2021 'Don't dismiss supermarket equal pay cases' FT.com 7 June.
