  "title": "Ohio Man Found Guilty in First Trial in Killings of Eight Family Members; George Wagner IV is one of four charged in execution-style shootings that prosecutors said were over a custody dispute",
  "text": "<p>The killings led to the largest homicide investigation in state history. Following initial speculation that a Mexican drug cartel could be involved, investigators eventually concluded that four Wagner family members committed the killings in the hope of gaining custody of a then-2-year-old whose father is Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, brother of George. Prosecutors said it took the Wagner family months of planning but only a few hours to carry out the killings of eight members of the Rhoden family.</p><p>Most Rhoden family victims, ages 14 to 44, were shot in the face or head at close range at four homes in a single night, said prosecutors. One family member and his fianc√©e were killed in bed, and their infant was found between them covered in blood but otherwise unharmed.</p><p>Mr. Wagner, who looked down while each guilty verdict was read, had pleaded not guilty. An attorney couldn't immediately be reached to comment on his conviction.</p><p>Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost praised investigators with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation following the verdict. \"Investigating this atrocity would have been a monumental task for just about any law enforcement agency in Ohio,\" he said.</p><p>It was the first conviction at trial in the case. Mr. Wagner's brother, Jake Wagner, and his mother, Angela Wagner, pleaded guilty last year and are awaiting formal sentencing. Mr. Wagner's father, George \"Billy\" Wagner III, is scheduled to stand trial next year.</p><p>Following the two guilty pleas, prosecutors said they wouldn't pursue the death penalty for any Wagners in the case.</p><p>During a 13-week trial, prosecutors painted a portrait of a troubled family and said that Mr. Wagner, who worked at the time as a diesel mechanic and truck driver, helped his father, mother and brother plan, carry out and cover up the killings.</p><p>Special Prosecutor D. Andrew Wilson said Mr. Wagner didn't have to pull the trigger to be guilty of aggravated murder. Prosecutors relied on testimony from Mr. Wagner's brother and mother.</p><p>But Mr. Wagner's attorney John P. Parker said that his client didn't know about the murders and that the testimony of Mr. Wagner's brother and mother, whom he described the two as \"liars,\" \"con artists\" and \"thieves,\" should be discounted.</p><p>\"George had absolutely no motive whatsoever,\" Mr. Parker said during his closing argument.</p><p>The jury deliberated less than a full day, after hearing testimony from 60 witnesses and viewing nearly 5,000 pieces of evidence. The evidence included forged documents, photographs of a silencer built from a flashlight and video of Mr. Wagner's mother at a Walmart buying shoes that prosecutors said were later worn during the killings.</p><p>Prosecutors said the Wagner family initially hatched a plan to kill Hanna Rhoden in January 2016, about a month after the Wagners intercepted a Facebook message in which Ms. Rhoden said she would never sign papers giving up custody of her daughter. \"They will have to kill me first,\" Ms. Rhoden wrote, according to prosecutors.</p><p>Investigators matched footprints found at a murder scene to a brand sold at Walmart early in the investigation. They eventually found a receipt showing that Angela Wagner had bought two pairs of tennis shoes shortly before the killings in April 2016 at a Walmart, and then they found the video of her making the purchase.</p><p>Investigators discovered that the Wagners had built a silencer using a Maglite flashlight. Prosecutors said Jake Wagner was a fan of the TV series \"The Walking Dead\" in which characters used such silencers. He later admitted to building the silencer, prosecutors said.</p><p>Prosecutors said the Wagners forged custody documents in Hanna Rhoden's name that said she would give up her daughter in the event of her death. The documents were dated 2014 but created in 2016 shortly before the murders, prosecutors said. Investigators eventually found shell casings on a Wagner family property that matched those found at the murder scenes.</p><p>Lead Special Prosecutor Angela Canepa said the trial could be the state's longest for a criminal case. In her opening statement, she said that Mr. Wagner was guilty of \"participation in one of the most heinous crimes that has ever been committed in the state of Ohio.\"</p><p>Write to Kris Maher at Kris.Maher@wsj.com</p><p>Ohio Man Found Guilty in First Trial in Killings of Eight Family Members</p>",
