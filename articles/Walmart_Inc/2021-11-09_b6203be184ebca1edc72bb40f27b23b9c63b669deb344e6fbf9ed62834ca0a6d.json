  "title": "Amazon Can Help PayPal Get Through a Rough Patch; A changing relationship with eBay is putting pressure on PayPal's growth, and it needs a stronger spending rebound and new partnerships to offset that",
  "text": "<p>PayPal was eBay's subsidiary before the two split in 2015. EBay has been migrating more of its payments to new arrangements recently, creating an increasing drag on PayPal's volume and revenue growth. EBay still offers PayPal as a checkout option, but it now works with Adyen as its primary payment-processing partner.</p><p>PayPal's payment volumes from eBay Marketplaces fell 45% from a year earlier in the third quarter. EBay represented about 3% of total payment volume, down from 7% a year ago. PayPal's third-quarter revenue grew 13%â€”but it would have been 25% excluding the effects of eBay.</p><p>Though PayPal anticipated the eBay headwinds, it also expected stronger drivers in spending overall. Things like supply-chain snarls hitting merchants' inventory and a dip in travel activity in late summer as the Delta variant of coronavirus spread put some pressure on volume growth. PayPal on Monday moderated some of its guidance for full-year 2021 growth. It also expects a tough comparison in the early part of next year.</p><p>But PayPal brought some other news to its earnings call on Monday: a new partnership with Amazon. The Amazon partnership was made possible as PayPal was freed from some of its lingering contractual obligations with eBay. Now, starting next year Amazon will be adding a pay-with-Venmo option to its online and mobile checkout. In addition, PayPal said Walmart now presents a PayPal checkout option for its grocery and marketplace businesses.</p><p>Amazon offers many ways to pay, and has arrangements with competitors like Affirm, too. But with its scale, Amazon represents a significant opportunity for PayPal's Venmo. PayPal said it expects Venmo to be a positive contributor to its transaction margin this year, a milestone given that many peer-to-peer Venmo transactions are free to consumers. Increasing use of Venmo to pay at merchants is helping accelerate revenue growth, and \"Amazon will no doubt take that to the next level,\" PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman said on Monday.</p><p>Spending growth will be uneven in an unpredictable economy. But positive new relationships can help PayPal steer through those rough patches.</p><p>Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon Can Help PayPal Get Through a Rough Patch</p>",
