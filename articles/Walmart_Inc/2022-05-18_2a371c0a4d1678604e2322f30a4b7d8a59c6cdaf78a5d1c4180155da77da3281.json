  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA lost 346 points, or 1.1%, to 32,230.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 52 points, or 1.3%, to 4,036.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP traded 176.3 points, or 1.5% lower, to 11,826.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow industrials jumped 431.17 points, or 1.3%, for a third straight day of gains. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 2%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.8%.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Investors were taking a fresh look at comments from Powell, who on Tuesday spoke of possible \"pain\" for Americans as the central bank moves resolutely to bring down inflation by raising interest rates. He was speaking at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything event.</p><p>\"Powell's words didn't hit the investor appetite immediately. Nasdaq rallied more than 2.5% yesterday, as the S&amp;P 500 rebounded 2%. But mixed activity in U.S. futures hint that appetite may not remain as strong in the coming sessions,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, in a note to clients.</p><p>Stocks got a lift on Tuesday from better-than-expected U.S.   retail sales data, as well as optimism over China's fight against COVID and signs of easing lockdowns. Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, pointed to another possible factor behind Tuesday's rise â€”- a Bloomberg reportdiscussing possibly bullish stock options activity.</p><p>\"Investors who have reduced exposure are adding upside protection hedges with index ETF call options,\" O'Rourke told clients in a note. The put-to-call ratio for the $361 billion SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ETF (ticker SPY) recently hit a two-year low, based on open contracts, that report said.</p><p>A low put-to-call ratio is considered a bullish indicator for markets. He said the story also noted a 2008 high for outstanding call options for the $163 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF QQQ. A call option gives investors the right to buy an asset at a specific time, and an abundance means increased interest in buying.</p><p>But against a backdrop of Powell's comments and disappointment from retailing giant Walmart WMT, O'Rourke remains wary. \"One can't help to think that days like today are simply setting investors up for the next disappointment,\" he said.</p><p>Shares of Target Corp. TGT tumbled 26% after the retailer reported earnings that fell far short of expectations. Shares of Lowe's Cos. LOW fell on mixed resultsfrom the home-improvement retailer. TJX Cos. TJX earnings are still ahead Wednesday and Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO will report after the close.</p><p>Read: Fund managers' cash pile is the biggest since 2001, says Bank of America</p><p>On U.S. economic data, construction of new housesfell slightly in April for the third month in a row. U.S. housing starts slipped 0.2% in April to an annual rate of 1.72 million units. U.S. housing permits fell 3.2% in April to an annual rate of 1.82 million units.</p><p>Investors are also expecting comments from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker at 4 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of AutoWeb Inc.
