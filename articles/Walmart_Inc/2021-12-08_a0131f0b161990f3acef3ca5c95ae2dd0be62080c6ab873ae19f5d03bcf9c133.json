  "text": "<p>   A 10% increase in Amazon's advertised hourly wages in 2018 led to an average increase of about 2.6% among other employers in labor markets where Amazon is located, according to a paper this year by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and Brandeis University. </p><p>   Amazon's influence on wage increases had a big effect because a large fraction of similar jobs then were below $15 an hour, researchers concluded. In comparison, when Walmart and Target Corp. announced $9 starting pay in 2015, the effect was smaller because there was a larger fraction of employers that were already at or above that pay level. Walmart in September raised its minimum wage to $12 an hour. </p><p>   At the same time, the researchers found Amazon's increase in pay failed to raise overall employment levels and actually led to a small decline. While some employers that raised wages hired additional workers, others cut back on employment or hours. In Amazon's case, the company's increase to $15 an hour led to an average decrease in \"probability of employment\" by 0.8 percentage point, the paper says. Other research showed similar results. </p><p>   In response to its overall effect on employment, Amazon has previously pointed to the billions it has invested in infrastructure and the amount of jobs it creates. </p><p>   In San Marcos, Texas, Amazon established its first fulfillment center in 2016 and soon approached the nearby Texas State University as the area's largest employer. </p><p>   Other warehouse operators in the area quickly felt the company's presence. Amazon advertised on radio stations hundreds of miles away and attracted workers from competitors in short order. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Shane Shifflett contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
