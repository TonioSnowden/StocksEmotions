  "title": "Retailers Need to Ace Back-to- School --- Many are pushing to get rid of inventory",
  "text": "<p>Retail stocks, which rode high last year, took a battering in May after earnings results from sector giants such as Walmart and Target showed that demand was slowing for discretionary goods. A basket of retail stocks in the S&amp;P 500 is down 29.4% year to date, 12.5 percentage points behind the broader index.</p><p>Retailers have a high bar to clear. Last year, retail sales in the back-to-school shopping months -- June to August -- rose 14.4% compared with a year earlier, according to the Census Bureau. So far this year sales still appear to be increasing, though at a slower pace: Retail sales in June grew 7.7% compared with a year earlier.</p><p>The good news is that for most parents, back-to-school spending counts as a necessity, not discretionary spending. Less than a quarter of respondents surveyed by the National Retail Federation said they are making do with last year's school items, roughly in line with previous years.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is likely to be a competitive selling season for retailers, who will be grasping for a piece of a slow-growing pie. Retailers are already promoting heavily to get rid of excess inventory from a quarter ago. Kohl's, Target and Dick's Sporting Goods all saw their merchandise levels swell by more than 40% last quarter compared with a year earlier.</p><p>The National Retail Federation estimates that American households shopping for K-12 children -- on aggregate -- will spend roughly the same amount on back-to-school items this year as last year. For college students, which is a bigger market, spending is expected to increase 4% compared with last year. Given the heady pace of inflation -- consumer prices were 9.1% higher in June compared with a year earlier -- it is likely that consumers are actually pulling back this year on the number of items they plan to buy.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the theme of this year's back-to-school survey is price sensitivity. Roughly 38% of shoppers surveyed by NRF said they were cutting back in other areas to cover the cost of back-to-school spending this year. Among back-to-college shoppers, nearly a third of respondents said they were buying more store or generic brand products this year; last year, just over a fifth of respondents said they were doing so. More consumers are saying they are shopping for sales and doing comparative shopping online.</p><p>Given consumers' shift to value, big-box retailers could end up being relative winners. With higher fuel prices and a surge of Covid-19 cases this summer, more consumers might see the appeal of consolidating their trips at retailers where they can find everything from groceries to apparel. Big-box retailers such as Walmart, Sam's Club and Costco also offer fuel discount programs.</p><p>Meanwhile, retailers such as Best Buy that are focused on electronics -- the star of the hybrid learning environment -- could face a tougher selling season. While NRF-surveyed consumers expected to spend more this year on all the top back-to-school categories -- including clothes, shoes and dorm furnishings -- the one notable exception was electronics, which respondents expect to spend less on. In a webinar on Tuesday, Mark Mathews, vice president at NRF, said that demand for electronic accessories such as computer mice and printers is softening, noting that these are items consumers may have already stocked up on for hybrid learning last year.</p><p>There are some gives and takes here. While Walmart and Target might benefit from trip consolidation, margins may still be under pressure as they probably had to promote heavily to sell excess inventory. Walmart and Target's inventory grew by 32% and 43% respectively last quarter compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, Best Buy's inventory levels only grew by 9.4% last quarter, implying lower risk for margins. Those with the highest bar to clear are retailers with both flagging sales and heavy excess inventory such as Kohl's and Gap, which last quarter saw inventories rise 40% and 34% from a year earlier respectively.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
