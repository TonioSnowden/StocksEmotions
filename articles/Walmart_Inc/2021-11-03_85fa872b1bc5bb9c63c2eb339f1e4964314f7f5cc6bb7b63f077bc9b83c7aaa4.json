  "title": "Business News:  Black Rifle Coffee, SPAC to Merge  ----  By Amrith Ramkumar",
  "text": "<p>   Black Rifle Coffee Co. is going public by combining with a special-purpose acquisition company in a merger that values the coffee seller focused on military veterans at about $1.7 billion, the companies said. </p><p>   Known for its pricier coffee and firearms-themed products such as its AK-47 Espresso Blend, Black Rifle is combining with the SPAC SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp. I. </p><p>   Black Rifle also sells branded apparel and produces digital content to promote its products to veterans and first responders. </p><p>   Founded by former Green Beret Evan Hafer in 2014, Black Rifle has capitalized on consumers' desire to shop at brands that support social causes. Mr. Hafer vowed in 2017 to hire 10,000 veterans after Starbucks Corp. promised to hire 10,000 refugees following then President Donald Trump's executive order barring more refugees from entering the country. </p><p>   Today, about half of Black Rifle's roughly 600 employees are military veterans, a total Mr. Hafer said in an interview he expects to grow after the SPAC deal. </p><p>   Salt Lake City-based Black Rifle expects sales this year to grow about 40% to roughly $230 million. Most of the company's revenue comes from online sales. It also has seven physical stores and sells through large outlets such as Walmart Inc. </p><p>   As part of the deal, Black Rifle plans to reorganize as a public-benefit corporation, meaning it will have fiduciary duties both to shareholders and social good. Many startups have become PBCs, with investors increasingly giving priority to companies' missions. </p><p>   \"We want to do well for ourselves and do good for our community,\" said Joe Reece, the SPAC's executive chairman. </p><p>   Shares of the SPAC rose 15% to $11.33 each on Tuesday after the deal was announced. </p><p>   Black Rifle is raising $100 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the deal. The hedge fund Engaged Capital -- one of the firms that backs the SilverBox Engaged SPAC -- is also putting in $100 million. </p><p>   Black Rifle and the SPAC have also raised additional funds in case SPAC investors withdraw money before the deal closes. Such withdrawals tend to occur when a SPAC's shares trade below its listing price and have surged lately, making it harder to complete deals. The SilverBox SPAC currently has $345 million. </p><p></p>",
