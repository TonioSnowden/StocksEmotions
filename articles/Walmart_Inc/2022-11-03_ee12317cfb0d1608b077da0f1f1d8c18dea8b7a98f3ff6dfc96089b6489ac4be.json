  "title": "Holiday Sales Growth Expected to Slow This Year; National Retail Federation predicts U.S. consumers to spend as much as $960 billion",
  "text": "<p>The NRF, the large trade group that counts retailers as members, believes some holiday shopping has started before November, as retailers have pushed holiday deals earlier each year, in part to boost overall spending.</p><p>Consumers, especially lower-income shoppers, are grappling with higher prices on a range of necessities, but they are still spending, said the NRF. Sales volume—or amount of items purchased—is also slated to increase from last year, said the organization.</p><p>\"Consumers are behaving more thoughtfully,\" said Matthew Shay, chief executive of the NRF. But the labor market is still strong and some consumers are tapping into savings to deal with price increases, he said.</p><p>Last year's holiday sales grew 13.5% over 2020 and totaled $889.3 billion, a large jump.</p><p>Some consulting firms predicted shoppers will spend about the same amount over the holidays as last year, but on fewer gifts in response to rising prices. Shoppers plan to spend around $1,455 over the season, in line with last year, according to a September survey of nearly 5,000 shoppers from Deloitte. Shoppers plan to purchase around nine gifts, down from 16 last year, said the survey.</p><p>U.S. retail spending stalled in September from the previous month, according to government data, as shoppers faced high inflation and rising interest rates. Compared with the same month a year earlier, retail sales rose 8.2%, in-line with the rate of inflation, a sign that people were spending more for fewer items.</p><p>Stubbornly high rates of inflation for a range of goods and services has crimped consumers' spending power and weakened their confidence in the broader economy. Some business executives and economists have warned people to brace for a recession in the months ahead.</p><p>Many industry watchers also predict that shoppers will head to stores to shop more frequently than earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic. Deloitte predicted that the share of in-store spending will rise 35% from last year, a return to 2019 levels.</p><p>Adobe, which tracks online spending, expects U.S. online sales to rise 2.5% to $209.7 billion between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 compared with the same period last year. Last year online spending during the same period rose 8.6%.</p><p>Discounts are also likely to be heavy for some items. In recent years brands and retailers didn't need to turn to discounts because demand soared for many goods.</p><p>This year inventory has soared and many retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have resorted to deep discounts to move goods and stock shelves with fresher items.</p><p>The dynamic \"will come as welcome news to consumers in search of promotions and deals,\" wrote Lori Zumwinkle, a senior managing director at Accenture, in a blog post last month.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Holiday Sales Growth Expected to Slow This Year</p>",
