  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Kroger isn't exactly dominating the grocery space today. That presents a mixed bag for investors to sort through. </p><p>\n  The supermarket giant had another solid quarter, with identical-store sales -- excluding fuel -- up 6.9% in its quarter ended Nov. 5 compared with a year earlier. That was much better than the 4.4% increase analysts polled by Visible Alpha were expecting. </p><p>\n  Identical-store sales of private-label products shined, rising 10.4% as consumers traded down. Customers are also being \"much more aggressive\" on downloading digital coupons and engaging with Kroger's promotional offers, Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on an earnings call on Thursday. Despite an upgrade in the full-year outlook, Kroger stock fell 1.6% in Thursday's trading. </p><p>\n  There certainly are nits to pick. Kroger's same-store sales growth still lags behind that of big-box retailers and some peers. Target and Walmart saw comparable-store sales in groceries increase by more than 10% last quarter, and Ahold Delhaize's U.S. business recorded 8.2% growth. </p><p>\n  While Kroger is doing well, it isn't exactly trouncing the competition. Additionally, its digital-sales growth of 10% last quarter lags behind Walmart's 16% growth over the comparable period. </p><p>\n  For the full year, Kroger's share of U.S. grocery e-commerce sales is expected to fall compared with a year earlier and stay stagnant in the following two years, according to estimates by Insider Intelligence. </p><p>\n  Those unflattering comparisons do offer some credence to Kroger's argument that it could use some bulking up to better compete as it looks to buy Albertsons. The companies on Tuesday defended their proposed merger at a Senate subcommittee hearing. Of course, whether that sways regulators is a different matter. </p><p>\n  A former attorney for the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition said the agency is likely to use a narrow definition of supermarkets that may exclude mass merchants, dollar stores and club stores such as Costco, according to a UBS report published in November. </p><p>\n  Given the uncertainty of the Albertsons transaction, investors will want to pay attention to the stand-alone company's ability to increase market share -- especially in online groceries, a space where both Kroger and Albertsons are laggards. That is where growth will be in the next few years: Total e-commerce grocery sales are expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% from 2022 to 2026, according to Insider Intelligence, trouncing the 3.8% expected growth in total grocery sales. It is also where additional margin will come from as grocery and retail companies grow their advertising and media business. </p><p>\n  And even if Kroger does manage to buy Albertsons, there is no guarantee that added scale will suddenly supercharge a mediocre digital sales strategy. </p><p>\n  As Kroger will try to highlight in talks with regulators, the grocery market looks a lot more digital today. But that argument doesn't exactly seem to be working in Kroger's favor. </p><p></p>",
