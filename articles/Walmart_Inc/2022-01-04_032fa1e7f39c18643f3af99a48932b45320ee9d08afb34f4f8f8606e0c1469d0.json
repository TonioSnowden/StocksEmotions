  "title": "Olympic Committee Becomes Latest Target of Critics of Treatment of Uyghurs; Activist group says IOC has refused to engage with it on human-rights issues in China's Xinjiang region, including use of forced labor to make apparel",
  "text": "<p>The group said its concerns center around Anta Sports Products Ltd., a Chinese sportswear giant that is the official supplier of IOC uniforms and other apparel for the Beijing Games. Anta last year publicly said it would keep using cotton from Xinjiang, where human-rights groups and governments including the U.S. allege that Chinese authorities are employing forced labor among the region's mostly Muslim minorities, including in cotton harvesting.</p><p>Beijing denies the allegations. Anta didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. It had previously declined to comment on concerns over forced labor in Xinjiang.</p><p>In a statement, the IOC said that a recent third-party audit of its Anta-provided uniforms \"demonstrated no issue in relation to forced labor.\" It said it works with suppliers to raise awareness of its criteria for sustainable sourcing, while also carrying out \"targeted due diligence.\"</p><p>The IOC is the latest organization to face scrutiny over Xinjiang, which has become a flashpoint for some of the world's biggest businesses. The U.S. government says Chinese authorities are committing human-rights abuses that amount to a genocide against ethnic Uyghurs and other minorities in the region. It has cited the issue in banning imports of goods from Xinjiang and announcing a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics.</p><p>Chinese officials call the allegations lies, saying it set up vocational camps to improve livelihoods and combat religious extremism. Chinese authorities and state-controlled news outlets have attacked Western companies, including fashion company H&amp;M Hennes and Mauritz AB and computer-chip giant Intel Corp., for highlighting the forced-labor concerns in Xinjiang. Walmart Inc. recently became the target of Beijing's criticism after social-media users accused it of not stocking Xinjiang produce in its China-based Walmart and Sam's Club stores.</p><p>The Uyghur-focused human-rights group, which includes Uyghur activists and nongovernmental organizations focused on labor rights, accused the IOC of rebuffing its many attempts to discuss forced-labor concerns. It shared email correspondence with an IOC official that it said demonstrated that the sports organization was \"unresponsive and disrespectful.\"</p><p>\"Their response is not credible,\" said Bennett Freeman, a spokesman for the group and former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor in the Clinton administration.</p><p>According to the exchange, Mr. Freeman wrote to the IOC in October, asking to discuss the forced-labor concerns, as well as other issues involving human rights and freedom of expression. He proposed that both sides work together to reduce human-rights risks related to the Beijing Games.</p><p>After a brief exchange, Magali Martowicz, the IOC's head of human rights, wrote in December that it was \"ready to engage in a one-time active listening exercise with the Coalition\" and proposed terms, which included keeping the conversation confidential.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Should human rights be a consideration for the IOC? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The activists responded that many of the terms were unacceptable, saying they wanted a two-way conversation and the ability to disclose the dialogue after it happened. Ms. Martowicz responded on Dec. 21 that \"as a result of differences in approach,\" it wouldn't be able to meet with the group. She said the IOC would continue to strengthen its work on labor rights.</p><p>In a statement, the IOC said: \"While generic concerns have been expressed in the past about Beijing 2022's product sourcing, the IOC has not been approached about any specific case or situation, including by the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region.\"</p><p>It added that it was \"disturbed\" that the group released its email exchanges, calling it a \"breach of trust, which indicates that the [group] was not interested in a meaningful or constructive exchange.\"</p><p>Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com</p><p>Olympic Committee Becomes Latest Target of Critics of Treatment of Uyghurs</p>",
