  "title": "Queen Elizabeth II Gets Immortalized as Barbie Doll, in Time for Her Birthday and Platinum Jubilee; Mattel designed the tribute doll to celebrate the British royal's 70 years on the throne",
  "text": "<p>The tribute doll commemorates Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee, marking her seven-decade reign. She is the longest serving British monarch, outlasting her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, who took the throne at 18 and reigned for 63 years.</p><p>Mattel's new Barbie has short, white hair that is perfectly coiffed, and comes wearing a long-sleeved ivory gown with a floral matelassé flourish, accompanied by statement silver jewelry, gloves, a navy blue sash and decorations of order. On her head, of course, is a crown.</p><p>The doll was made as part of Barbie's Tribute Collection, which launched last year, according to Mattel, when the company released a Lucille Ball doll.</p><p>Mattel said the Queen Elizabeth II doll's look was inspired by both the color and style of gown she has favored in royal portraits. The packaging—featuring golden framing in front of images of red carpet and a throne—was inspired by Buckingham Palace, Mattel added.</p><p>There is already high demand for the doll.</p><p>Craig Parshall, a 48-year-old web designer from Illinois, saw the Barbie doll mentioned in a news story Thursday and wanted to buy it for his wife, who has always been fascinated by the queen, he said.</p><p>\"She's always kind of adored her,\" he said. \"She has this affection for women in high places.\"</p><p>But he was too late. The $75 Barbie sold out on the Mattel Creations website in eight hours, according to the toy maker. The site specifies that sales were limited to three per customer.</p><p>\"As much as I would like to jump on a plane and hop across the pond to do a little shopping, that's probably not in the cards for a Barbie doll,\" said Mr. Parshall, who himself was more of a Star Wars action-figure fan.</p><p>Mattel said 20,000 dolls were made. Retailers Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. are selling it in the U.S. A spokeswoman for Walmart said the doll, which was only available online, sold out within two hours on Thursday.</p><p>On Amazon.com, the Barbie was the No. 1 new release in dolls on Thursday. The only ones available by late afternoon were from sellers offering the doll as collectibles in \"like new\" condition for at least roughly $580.</p><p>In the U.K., the Barbie is being sold at famed toy store Hamleys, as well as department stores Harrods, Selfridges and John Lewis.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II Gets Immortalized as Barbie Doll, in Time for Her Birthday and Platinum Jubilee</p>",
