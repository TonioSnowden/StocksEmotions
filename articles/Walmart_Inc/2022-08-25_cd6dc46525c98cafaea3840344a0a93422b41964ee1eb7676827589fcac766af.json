  "title": "Dollar General, Dollar Tree Get a Lift From Higher Prices and Thrifty Shoppers; Discounters say shoppers spent more on food, less on items such as apparel and home goods",
  "text": "<p>Shoppers are more often using credit cards, not cash, said Dollar Tree Chief Executive Mike Witynski on a call with analysts. They are buying more powdered detergent, which is cheaper than liquid detergent, and skipping fabric softener or detergent entirely. \"The customer is pressured,\" he said.</p><p>Dollar General said comparable sales, those from stores and digital channels operating at least 12 months, rose 4.6% in the quarter ended July 29 compared with the same period last year. More shoppers visited its stores and spent more on consumables such as food but less on apparel, seasonal goods and home products. Apparel sales dropped 21.4% in the quarter.</p><p>At Dollar Tree, which owns the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar chains, comparable sales rose 4.9% in the quarter ended July 30. The company said consumers are shifting spending to more need-based purchases such as food.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How has inflation changed the way you shop? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Fewer shoppers visited each chain during the quarter, but they typically spent more per trip, Dollar Tree executives said. Late last year the company raised prices at its Dollar Tree chain for many goods to $1.25 from $1.</p><p>In recent weeks major retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have noted that consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending, instead giving priority to food and fuel amid rising prices.</p><p>The dollar-chain competitors reported diverging profit estimates as Dollar Tree works to improve performance at Family Dollar, the chain it purchased in 2015 and has struggled to improve since.</p><p>Dollar Tree narrowed its net sales expectations for the year and reduced its profit outlook, in large part because it lowered prices at Family Dollar to improve sales, the company said. That investment, along with shoppers spending less on items that often carry higher profit margins, contributed to the forecast change, the company said.</p><p>The company expects earnings-per-share to fall in a range of $7.10 to $7.40 for the full year, down from a previous estimate of $7.80 to $8.20.</p><p>Dollar Tree's shares fell more than 9% to $150 in Thursday trading, while Dollar General's stock fell 1% to nearly $245.</p><p>Dollar Tree is attracting more shoppers from households with annual incomes of more than $80,000, which is higher than its typical customers, said Mr. Witynski on a call with analysts.</p><p>Dollar General raised its sales expectations for the year and maintained its profit outlook. It now expects comparable sales to rise 4% to 4.5%, up from a previous estimate of 3% to 3.5%.</p><p>\"I've never felt better about our positioning,\" said Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos on a conference call with analysts. \"We are here to help that customer through probably the toughest time she's seen in quite a while.\"</p><p>The company is also preparing for a management transition, with Mr. Vasos stepping down as CEO. He will be succeeded by one of his lieutenants, Jeff Owen, on Nov. 1.</p><p>On Thursday, Dollar General said net sales rose 9% to $9.4 billion in the most recent quarter. Net income rose 6.4% to $678 million. Earnings per share were $2.98 during the quarter, beating analysts' expectations of $2.94, according to FactSet.</p><p>Dollar Tree said net sales rose 6.7% to $6.77 billion during the most recent quarter. Net income rose 27.4% to $359.9 million. Earnings-per-share rose 30.1% to $1.60, in line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Dollar General, Dollar Tree Get a Lift From Higher Prices and Thrifty Shoppers</p>",
