  "title": "U.S. Jobless Claims Hit Lowest Level in Five Months; Applications for unemployment benefits have fallen below the prepandemic average as employers hold on to workers in a tight labor market",
  "text": "<p>The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, fell by 8,750 to 207,000.</p><p>Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving ongoing unemployment benefits, decreased to 1.35 million in the week ended Sept. 17 from 1.38 million a week earlier. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.</p><p>\"The low level of claims is a reminder that labor market conditions remain extremely tight even as we head toward a mild recession next year,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note.</p><p>The Commerce Department separately said inflation in the second quarter was higher than previously estimated, pointing to the difficulties the Federal Reserve faces in tamping down persistent price increases that have spread through the economy.</p><p>The department didn't revise its estimate that the U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, contracted 0.6% in the April to June period, however. Consumer spending was stronger than previously estimated, it said, but revised estimates of U.S. exports and inventories offset the improved spending picture.</p><p>The report, which included five years of benchmark revisions, also revised downward gross domestic income—a measure of corporate profits, wages and benefits, self-employment income, interest and rent—to a 0.1% increase in the second quarter. That largely closed a gap between output and income thathad pointed to a stalling economy rather than a recession.</p><p>\"The annual revisions to GDP and gross domestic income indicate a weaker U.S. economy in the first half of 2022 than initially reported,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group.</p><p>The U.S. labor market has shown signs of strength despite cooling from a red-hot pace earlier in the year. Employers added 315,000 jobs in August. The unemployment rate—at 3.7% in August—remains near a half-century low of 3.5%. The labor participation rate ticked up last month, meaning more people entered the labor market to fill historically high numbers of job vacancies.</p><p>There are nearly two job openings for every unemployed person seeking work. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers must narrow to bring the labor market into better balance. The Fed is aggressively raising interest rates to cool the labor market and rein in historically high rates of inflation. In August, the consumer-price index rose 8.3% over the prior year, a slight slowdown from a recent high of 9.1% in June.</p><p>Job openings rose in July after declining for three straight months, reflecting companies' ongoing hunger for workers, while layoffs held at historically low levels.</p><p>Some companies, though, are pulling back on hiring and cutting head count. Gap Inc. is eliminating about 500 corporate jobs. Meta Platforms Inc. is planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions. Walmart Inc. said it would cut back on hiring seasonal workers for the winter holidays, looking to hire 40,000 temporary workers compared with last year's goal of hiring 150,000 permanent workers for the busy shopping season and beyond.</p><p>—Gabriel T.
