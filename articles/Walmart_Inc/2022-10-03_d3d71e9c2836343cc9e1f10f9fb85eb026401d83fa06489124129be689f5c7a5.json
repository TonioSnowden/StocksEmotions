  "title": "Clayton Dubilier & Rice Sued Over Disclosures for Zest Soap Bond Deal; The private-equity firm says investors knew the risks of investing in consumer-products company High Ridge",
  "text": "<p>High Ridge used the $250 million bond to repay $93 million in debt owed to a Clayton-owned lending vehicle. High Ridge filed for chapter 11 in 2019 and sold virtually all of its assets, but a liquidating trustee is trying to recover money for unpaid bondholders in the bankruptcy.</p><p>On Friday, Clayton filed papers asking for the lawsuit to be dismissed, saying it is without merit and is based on emails that were taken out of context. The firm also said the $250 million bond benefitted High Ridge, refinancing debt and lowering its interest rate.</p><p>The liquidating trustee, Alan Halperin, alleged that Clayton omitted key information from an offering memorandum for the bonds, including that in January 2017 High Ridge fired its sales chief and that Walmart changed its store layout in a way that moved a High Ridge body wash away from eye level.</p><p>The offering memo for the bond sale also didn't mention that High Ridge \"missed a number of sales forecasts for January and February 2017 even though these misses were known\" when materials were given to potential investors, according to the complaint, originally filed under seal last year.</p><p>An unredacted version was made available last month in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The private-equity firm said in its papers on Friday that it injected $45 million in equity in High Ridge in late 2016, which Clayton said it likely wouldn't have done if it thought the business was a sinking ship.</p><p>The trustee alleges that bond investors were told one thing, while Clayton directors made contradictory statements in private, according to the lawsuit. Learning of disappointing sales results, a Clayton executive in February 2017 emailed a Clayton partner who also served on the High Ridge board, writing it was a \"disaster,\" and that they \"needed to regroup on this team asap.\"</p><p>The colleague responded, \"yes, this is awful,\" according to the complaint. That same month, a Clayton executive told a colleague that he and other Clayton employees had overestimated the abilities of High Ridge management. He said he \"[felt] like we have let down our partners.\"</p><p>Clayton, in its motion to dismiss, said the emails were taken out of context. It also said the trustee complaint doesn't allege that information furnished to bondholders about High Ridge's historical financial performance was false.</p><p>The offering memorandum clearly warned that High Ridge's historical financial performance was not indicative of how it would perform in the future, and investors who ignored those warnings did so at their own risk, Clayton said.</p><p>Clayton also said High Ridge's disclosures acknowledged that its performance had been trending downward through the end of 2016.</p><p>Clayton said \"evolving views of management performance—even when negative\"—don't make disclosures of that management team's background, experience or roles false and misleading.</p><p>As for changes that Walmart made to its shelf space, hurting High Ridge, Clayton said other \"courts have made clear that ‘there is no general duty on the part of a company to provide [investors] with all material information.'\"</p><p>The offering memorandum describes High Ridge's historical relationship with Walmart and contained no statements that its past relationship with Walmart would continue, Clayton said. As sophisticated investors, the bond purchasers had a duty to investigate the current status of a major customer if that was an important investment consideration, Clayton said.</p><p>The private-equity firm said that through most of 2019, it provided forbearance on collecting consulting fees that Clayton was due multiple times, giving High Ridge and its creditors, including the bondholders, time to consider restructuring alternatives.</p><p>Those \"negotiations ultimately dwindled,\" resulting in the bankruptcy filing, Clayton said.</p><p>The trustee, represented by Gordon Novod of Grant &amp; Eisenhofer PA, also has asked that Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP not be allowed to represent Clayton, saying the firm faces a conflict of interest because it previously also advised High Ridge in the debt deals at the center of the complaint.</p><p>Debevoise said it strongly opposes the trustee's motion and will file a response later this month.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
