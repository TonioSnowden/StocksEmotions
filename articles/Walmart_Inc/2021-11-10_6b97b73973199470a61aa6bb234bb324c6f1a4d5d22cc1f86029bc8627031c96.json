  "title": "Warren Buffett-Backed Paytm Set to Raise $2.5 Billion in India's Largest IPO; Much-hyped deal didn't go as smoothly as other recent technology IPOs",
  "text": "<p>Paytm is one of India's largest digital payments and financial services platforms, serving more than 333 million consumers. It has been facingstiff competitionfrom payment apps offered by global players including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Walmart Inc.-backed Indian startup PhonePe.</p><p>Paytm's big corporate backers include Chinese fintech giant Ant Group Co., SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which are all selling some shares in the IPO. The company's founder, Indian billionaire Vijay Shekhar Sharma, also is cashing in.</p><p>Unlike several IPOs in India which were fully subscribed on their first day, such as that of food-delivery startup Zomato Ltd. and FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd., the parent of beauty products retailer Nykaa, Paytm's IPO dragged until the end.</p><p>By day two, individual investors had bid for more shares than the amount reserved for them. But the portion reserved for institutional investors wasn't fully subscribed until a few hours before the close of the offer period Wednesday. Toward the end, large investors bid for nearly 2.8 times their quota, enabling the IPO to be 1.9 times subscribed overall, according to stock-exchange data.</p><p>\"From my perspective, valuations are expensive,\" said Aneesh Srivastava, Mumbai-based chief investment officer of Star Health &amp; Allied Insurance Co., which didn't buy in. Mr. Srivastava added he was cautious because many startups that have gone public this year are losing money and burning cash with no clear path to profitability.</p><p>Around 99% of the IPO's institutional demand came from foreign investors, while large domestic investors such as insurance companies and mutual funds barely participated in the open offer, according to a stock-exchange filing. A few domestic institutions had participated in the earlier investment round.</p><p>One97 incurred losses of around $230 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, and also lost money in the preceding two years, according to its listing prospectus. Its total income, which comprises revenue and other income, was around $430 million for the year ended March 31, but was below that of the previous year.</p><p>Some analysts said that the late investor bidding for Paytm's IPO likely had to do with the deal's large size.</p><p>\"They got a subscription, that's enough,\" said Deven Choksey, managing director of brokerage firm KRChoksey Shares and Securities Pvt.</p><p>During SoftBank's quarterly earnings call earlier this week, the Japanese conglomerate's leader Masayoshi Son said he is bullish about Paytm's future prospects. \"I believe Paytm should grow significantly,\" Mr. Son said, adding that \"the IPO should be a great event for SoftBank\" and the business can grow its value going forward.</p><p>One97's shares are likely to be priced at the higher end of its offered price range of 2,080 rupees to 2,150 rupees ($28.04 to $28.99), which would value the company at around $20 billion. Paytm shares are expected to list on the BSE and the National Stock Exchange of India on Nov. 18.</p><p>Paytm said Wednesday it was \"overwhelmed by the outstanding response\" to its IPO. It said the deal was a \"testament to the India story, our startup ecosystem and the depth of the Indian capital markets,\" and that it would keep pushing for greater financial inclusion in the country.</p><p>Write to Shefali Anand at shefali.anand@wsj.com</p><p>Warren Buffett-Backed Paytm Set to Raise $2.5 Billion in India's Largest IPO</p>",
