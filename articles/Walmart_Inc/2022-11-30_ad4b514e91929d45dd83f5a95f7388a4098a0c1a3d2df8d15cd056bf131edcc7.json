  "title": "Kroger, Albertsons Chiefs Pledge  To Keep Prices Low, Protect Jobs  ----  By Jaewon Kang",
  "text": "<p>   Chief executives of the two largest U.S. supermarket chains defended their proposed $20 billion merger Tuesday at a Senate subcommittee hearing, vowing to keep prices low and protect workers' jobs if the deal passes. </p><p>   Kroger Co. CEO Rodney McMullen and Albertsons Cos. CEO Vivek Sankaran testified before the Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights, where senators from both parties questioned whether the planned combination would reduce competition in the grocery sector, lead to higher prices and eliminate worker jobs or stores. </p><p>   \"Kroger currently is ranked fourth in total revenue among U.S. grocery retailers behind Walmart, Amazon and Costco,\" Mr. McMullen said in a prepared statement. \"A combined Kroger and Albertsons will remain at number four.\" </p><p>   Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), the subcommittee's ranking Republican member, said the companies haven't explained why the merger is necessary and whether various commitments on prices, wages and stores will be fulfilled. </p><p>   \"Inflation, to put it gently, is wreaking havoc on our entire economy but not on the grocery industry, it appears,\" Mr. Lee said. </p><p>   Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by sales, in October agreed to acquire Albertsons, the second-largest operator, for about $20 billion, in a deal that the companies said would boost their scale and technology and help them compete better against rivals. Together, the companies could command about 13% of food-retail sales in the U.S. after divestitures, below Walmart Inc.'s 22%, according to J.P. Morgan analysts. </p><p>   Since then, the deal has drawn opposition from elected officials, independent retailers and some union groups over its potential impact on workers' jobs as well as on industry competition and food prices for consumers. Some lawmakers, including Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), the Senate subcommittee's chair, have said they worry the merger may hinder competition. </p><p>   Kroger and Albertsons have said their combination would give them a more national reach with a bigger network of stores, distributors and suppliers. The companies have said they expect to invest $500 million in keeping prices low along with spending $1 billion on wages and benefits and $1.3 billion on improving Albertsons stores. </p><p>   Mr. McMullen, who started at Kroger as a part-time bagger in Lexington, Ky., in 1978, told the Senate subcommittee that the grocer's business has been built around lowering prices to attract customers and that it lowered prices after acquiring Harris Teeter Supermarkets Inc. and Roundy's Inc. </p><p>   Mr. McMullen said the combined entity intends to keep prices low and won't lay off any front-line workers in stores, warehouses and manufacturing facilities as part of the merger. He added that price cuts would start immediately and that the companies expect to invest $500 million over four years on that effort. </p><p>   \"I just don't see less competition going forward,\" Mr. McMullen said. </p><p>   Albertsons' Mr. Sankaran said that his company determined that merging with Kroger represented the best way to compete against Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart, and that the intent isn't to close stores. </p><p>   Some senators brought up the 2015 merger between Albertsons and Safeway, which prompted the supermarket companies to sell some stores to Haggen Holdings LLC to secure regulatory approval. Haggen went bankrupt less than a year later, and Albertsons wound up buying back some stores. </p><p>   Sen. Lee on Tuesday called that remedy an \"embarrassing failure,\" and asked whether there was a response. Mr. Sankaran said the divestiture and the buyer were approved by the Federal Trade Commission and that the deal succeeded. </p><p>   Kroger and Albertsons are working with the FTC to determine the number of stores the companies may need to sell to secure approval for their deal. The chains have said they expect the regulatory review process to take as long as two years, with the deal closing in early 2024. </p><p></p>",
