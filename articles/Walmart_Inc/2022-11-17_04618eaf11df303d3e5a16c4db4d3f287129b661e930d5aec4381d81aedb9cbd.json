  "title": "'Sad Beige' Takes Over Baby Gear --- Parents hope neutrals lead to calm, quiet kids",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Kyne joins a wave of parents eschewing bright and stereotypically gendered colors for kid wares, and instead choosing earthy, neutral tones aligned with minimalism. It's a look TikTok satirist Hayley DeRoche has termed \"sad beige,\" but some see it as a happy development: The ecru, blond and brown products fit in with their stylishly muted decor in the rest of the house.</p><p>\"Our whole house isn't changing because we have kids,\" said Jen Atkin, a celebrity hairstylist and entrepreneur in Los Angeles known for working with the Kardashians -- although she conceded that the aesthetic can invite stains. Because she has two kids and three dogs, she bought easy-to-clean beige outdoor rugs and couches for her home.</p><p>Kylie Jenner showed off the beige furnishings in her son Wolf's nursery in a video from March. Caitlin Covington, a content creator in North Carolina known online as \"Christian Girl Autumn,\" often dresses her daughter in brown and ecru ensembles for portraits.</p><p>\"I've been influenced by influencers,\" said Amina Kadyrova, a mother of three in New Jersey. \"But I genuinely like it.\" Neutral colors are easier to mix and match on kids, she added.</p><p>Earlier this year, Baby Gap created a designated beige section inside some stores after researching market trends, according to the brand's head designer, Carolyn Koziak. A new line from Walmart, Easy Peasy, includes a lot of beige, too. According to Etsy, searches for beige kids clothes jumped 67% in the past 12 months compared with the previous period.</p><p>\"It seems to be marketing this fantasy that if I buy neutrals, my children will also be neutral, calm and quiet,\" said Ms. DeRoche, the TikTok user, who lives in Petersburg, Va.</p><p>Most children's companies still sell lots of toys and clothes in bright and inviting primary colors. \"It's important to expose kids to learning colors to help them with their visual perception,\" said Ann-Louise Lockhart, a pediatric psychologist in San Antonio. \"Having variety is important for brain development.\"</p><p>Amanda Gummer, a neuropsychologist and children's play expert in Britain, said there isn't evidence that colorless toys stunt developmental milestones. Still, Dr. Gummer said, \"the motivation of having an Instagrammable house and not letting kids explore and make a mess worries me. I don't think many kids' favorite color is beige.\"</p><p>Ms. Atkin said her children can get their color fix elsewhere. \"My son will go to indoor gymnasiums, play centers, museums, and he gets covered in slime and goo, and color and glitter,\" she said. \"We do that outside of our house, and then we get to come home to a nice, calm, clean environment.\"</p><p>Other parents noted the pacifying nature of neutrals. \"Brown and beige make me feel calmer,\" said Maddie Berna, a photographer and mother of two in central California. \"I personally don't like super bright colors, and they do wear that sometimes, but it's annoying to see all the time.\"</p><p>Ms. Berna's mother, Ashley Durham, isn't a fan.</p><p>\"All of Ellie's bows are the same kind of beige and I would like her to wear something that sticks out more,\" she said, referring to her 15-month-old granddaughter. \"I do try to buy them brighter color clothing. I just never see them in it.\"</p><p>Naomi Coe, a California-based interior designer specializing in kid's rooms, said she experienced an influx of beige requests during the pandemic, when many parents were spending more time at home.</p><p>\"Neutral is going to give you calm, serene, homey, cozy,\" she said. \"I've noticed a shift where people are after that feeling more.\"</p><p>Laura Roso Vidrequin, founder of secondhand kids-clothing marketplace Kids O'Clock in London, said beige products sell three times as fast as other colors on the site -- perhaps because they are gender-neutral, she said, hence easy to pass down.</p>",
