  "title": "Business News: Increased Menu Prices Lift McDonald's Sales in U.S.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Kempczinski said Tuesday that McDonald's is planning for a wider range of scenarios given weakening consumer sentiment and the possibility of a global recession. The company is looking at whether it needs to offer more value options on its menus in markets, he said.</p><p>Companies this earnings season are signaling concerns as consumer confidence drops and inflation runs at its highest level in decades. Walmart Inc. on Monday said it was having to cut prices to reduce inventory as consumers pulled back, and expected its profits to fall as a result. Several high-tech companies have noted slowing growth recently.</p><p>McDonald's said same-store sales rose 3.7% in the U.S. from last year's period, outpacing analysts' expectations. Sales of all types of meals, particularly breakfast, were higher, the company said. Lower-income customers are choosing more value offerings and fewer combo meals, McDonald's said, while the company is gaining some consumers who are shifting away from sit-down and fast-casual restaurants.</p><p>McDonald's said it expects commodity and wage inflation, along with rising energy prices, to affect restaurant margins for the rest of the year. For instance, the company expects U.S. food and paper costs this year to increase by 12% to 14% from 2021 levels, and wages to grow 10% on an annual basis. Executives said they expect inflation to be more pronounced in Europe than in the U.S.</p><p>McDonald's shares rose more than 2% to $257.09. Through Tuesday's close, they were up 5.37% in the last year.</p><p>The company said that its U.S. franchisee- and company-owned restaurants raised prices in its most recent quarter at similar levels to earlier this year. The company said in April that its U.S. locations had increased menu prices by an average of 8% in the first quarter compared with last year's period.</p><p>Some McDonald's owners have dropped the chain's U.S. deal offering soda and other cold beverages of any size for a dollar. McDonald's said that while it still offers national promotions, local restaurants increasingly determine value offerings at their locations.</p><p>McDonald's reported a $1.3 billion pretax charge this year through the second quarter connected to the sale of its Russian business. Same-store sales rose 9.7% globally during the three-month period ended June 30, the company said, noting that it was excluding its Russian stores from that figure.</p><p>The fast-food giant posted a 3% drop in total revenue to $5.72 billion for the quarter, coming in under analyst projections of $5.8 billion, according to FactSet. Excluding currency effects, revenue would have increased 3%, McDonald's said. Profit fell by nearly half to $1.19 billion, or $1.60 a share, during the second quarter. Excluding that and other one-time items, adjusted earnings were $2.55 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $2.47 a share.</p><p>---</p><p>Dean Seal contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
