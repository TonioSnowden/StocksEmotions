  "title": "Best Buy Cuts Sales, Profit Outlook on Weaker Demand for Electronics; Sales at competitors have forced the retailer to reduce prices, eating into margins",
  "text": "<p>Shares of Best Buy fell about 2% in late trading.</p><p>Best Buy posted growth in annual sales and profits over the last two years as people rushed to buy laptops and videogame systems among other products, as Covid-19 health protocols meant people spending more time at home.</p><p>A range of retailers have revised profit or sales estimates, citing a rapidly changing consumer environment and, in some cases, a glut of inventory as peak-pandemic purchases for household goods fall off.</p><p>Earlier this week, Walmart Inc., the country's largest retailer by revenue, said that its profit would be lower than previously expected for the current quarter as consumers spend more for food and fuel, leaving less to buy higher-margin items such as apparel. Walmart said it would lower prices on apparel and other inventory to boost sales.</p><p>In June, Target Corp. issued a profit warning three weeks after its quarterly earnings announcement, saying that it had too many items such as patio furniture. Chains such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. and Gap Inc. recently issued profit warnings and replaced their leaders. Target and other chains have also heavily discounted some inventory to spur sales.</p><p>On Wednesday, Best Buy said that it expects inventory levels for the current quarter to be flat from the same period last year. But sales at some competitors have forced the retailer to reduce prices, eating into margins, the company said.</p><p>The company expects comparable sales—those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months—to fall 13% during the current quarter and 11% for the full year compared with the same periods last year. Its previous forecast called for around an 8% decline in the quarter and between 3% and 6% for the year.</p><p>For the full year, Best Buy expects adjusted operating income to be about 4% of revenue, down from a previous estimate of between 5.2% and 5.4%.</p><p>The company said it plans to share more information when it releases its second-quarter report Aug. 30.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Best Buy Cuts Sales, Profit Outlook on Weaker Demand for Electronics</p>",
