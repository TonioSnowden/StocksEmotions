  "title": "Others Work Through Covid. Should You? --- Milder variants and cuts to pandemic sick-leave policies fuel pressure to power through the illness, some employees say",
  "text": "<p>The Omicron variant's often milder symptoms are also prompting many employees with remote-work options to simply power through their illness from home. As cases rise in places with high vaccination rates, many say they feel the same pressure to minimize sick days as they did in prepandemic times.</p><p>A survey of 3,600 hourly workers by The Shift Project at Harvard University's Kennedy School this spring found that two-thirds of those who reported getting sick with Covid-19 or otherwise worked through their illness. People cited financial responsibilities as the top reason, followed by being afraid they would get in trouble for calling in sick and not being able to get their shifts covered.</p><p>Salaried workers also appear to be holding back on taking sick days. In a 2021 survey of workers at more than 400 employers, non-hourly employees took an average of four sick days last year -- the same as in 2018 -- according to Mercer LLC, the consulting firm that conducted the research. Rich Fuerstenberg, senior partner in Mercer's health and benefits practice, says one reason workers didn't take more sick time in a pandemic was because many could work from home.</p><p>Until recently, many employers had established extra sick days specifically for recovering from Covid-19 or tending to family members diagnosed with the disease. These policies are being scaled back as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shortened recommended isolation periods. In March, Walmart ended a special paid sick-leave program, except when required by local governments, that gave hourly workers extra paid time off for Covid-19 illnesses, exposures or Covid-like symptoms beyond the company's standard sick-leave pay.</p><p>Amazon ended a program this month offering U.S. hourly workers who test positive for Covid-19 one week of paid time off. Those employees can now receive a week of excused, unpaid time off or use existing paid leave as they would for other illnesses. At the start of the pandemic, Amazon offered U.S. employees up to two weeks of paid time off for a Covid-19 diagnosis or exposure-related quarantine.</p><p>Others, such as Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna Inc., don't require employees to use personal sick time to recover from Covid-19. Instead, Moderna's 3,200 employees are eligible to be paid regularly throughout their quarantine, a spokeswoman says.</p><p>Some working parents say they are saving sick days because it is likely they will need them if their children test positive or child care is otherwise disrupted. Lauren Erbach Barnfield's family was still observing early-pandemic safety protocols -- masking at daycare and primarily socializing outdoors -- when she and her 3- and 4-year-old all got Covid-19 in April. Though her employer, a health nonprofit, grants 10 days of dedicated sick time each year, she learned that additional days off allocated for Covid-19 were no longer available.</p><p>With two young children, she says she was loath to use all her sick time so early in the year. She worked out an arrangement with her manager to use half a sick day each day of the two weeks her children were home in quarantine, caring for them during the day and logging on for several hours after they went to bed around 7 p.m.</p><p>\"My employer was so generous and allowed me to work these funky alternative hours,\" Ms. Barnfield says. \"But also, I was sick with Covid, caring for small children all day. As soon as they went to bed, I was working.\"</p><p>Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, says he recommends that those infected with Covid-19 take time off because they are likely not functioning at peak levels.</p><p>\"If you do decide to get some work in, try to do it on a limited basis,\" says Dr. Hotez, who is also dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \"You may not even be aware of your brain fog.\"</p><p>Stepping back from work is often more difficult in practice. Dr. Hotez tested positive for Covid-19 this month despite being fully vaccinated and receiving two booster shots. His symptoms -- a cough, headache and fatigue -- have been mild, and he took Pfizer Inc.'s antiviral pill, Paxlovid, he says.</p><p>Though he canceled some in-person meetings, he still did national TV interviews and other work at home, he says. A number of other high-profile figures recently stricken with Covid-19 -- from Bill Gates to New York Mayor Eric Adams -- also said they attended virtual meetings while experiencing mild symptoms.</p><p>Hillary St. John and her husband and 4-year-old son all tested positive for Covid-19 on different days in April. As a result, safety protocols at her son's daycare center required that he complete a 14-day quarantine period to accommodate his exposure and subsequent illness. Household survey data released in April by the U.S. Census Bureau shows that nearly six million adults took leave or cut back hours in March and April because of health-related disruptions to child care, consistent with recent months.</p><p>Ms. St. John, a human-resources generalist, says her manager and team were supportive, and a colleague tackled in-person meetings for her. Still, working while nursing her symptoms and trading off caretaking with her husband required considerable juggling. She logged on between 4:30 and 5 a.m. each day, working until her son woke around 8:30 and then turning her attention to him until his afternoon nap. After his 8:30 p.m. bedtime, she would log back on and wrap up work for the day.</p><p>\"It was certainly not ideal,\" Ms. St. John says, \"but I was able to make it work.\"</p><p>She ultimately used one full sick day of the eight she is allotted each year -- to sleep.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
