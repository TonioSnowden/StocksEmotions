  "text": "<p>New details have since emerged about the investigation, in particular how it took advantage of not only advanced forensic tools but also the growing push to rein in crypto crime, including by the industry itself.</p><p>Cryptocurrency has long been a preferred option for criminals big and small, due to its perceived anonymity and capacity for frictionless international transfers. Despite its reputation as hard to trace, analysts say it is sometimes easier to track than hard currencies. Every transaction is public, leaving a permanent trail. The trick is tying that money to real people.</p><p>Mr. Lichtenstein, 34, and Ms. Morgan, 31, were charged with conspiring to launder money and defraud the federal government. The most serious count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Federal prosecutors haven't alleged that the couple committed the hack.</p><p>Their lawyers didn't respond to requests for comment. In a memo filed to court, their lawyers said, \"The money laundering accusations in the Government's complaint are predicated on a series of circumstantial inferences and assumptions drawn from a complex web of convoluted blockchain and cryptocurrency tracing assertions.\"</p><p>At a hearing on Monday, a judge ordered Mr. Lichtenstein to be held in jail but allowed Ms. Morgan to be released to home incarceration on a $3 million bond package while they await trial.</p><p>The pair have been together for seven years, their lawyers said. Mr. Lichtenstein was an introvert who preferred coding and making computer circuit boards over socializing, friends of the couple said. His family emigrated to the U.S. from Russia when he was 6 to avoid religious persecution, his lawyers said. Ms. Morgan, from Northern California, was more outgoing. She wrote columns for Forbes where she described herself as an expert dedicated to fighting fraud and cybercrime.</p><p>The theft came in August 2016, when hackers used malware to infiltrate the Hong Kong-based Bitfinex exchange's network and moved the bitcoin -- then worth about $71 million -- through more than 2,000 unauthorized transfers to an outside account. In January 2017, small amounts began moving in a series of complex transactions, according to a criminal complaint filed against Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan.</p><p>Early on, according to the complaint, the stolen bitcoin was channeled through AlphaBay, an online marketplace operating on the dark web. AlphaBay also advertised itself as a cryptocurrency \"tumbler,\" a service that could exchange deposited bitcoin for others to help prevent tracing. In July of 2017, federal authorities seized and shut down AlphaBay.</p><p>Prosecutor filings said that some of the stolen Bitfinex bitcoin that had been tumbled by the pair through AlphaBay accounts were then deposited into newly created accounts at several exchanges registered to foreign email addresses created around the time of the hack. The deposits quickly ran afoul of anti-money-laundering compliance efforts at crypto exchanges, prosecutors allege.</p><p>Some exchanges asked to verify the identities of some of the account holders. When they received no response, the exchanges froze the accounts, with more than $300,000.</p><p>Authorities said in filings that cryptocurrency tied to the hack was then moved into accounts Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan had created tied to their identities and businesses.</p><p>In bail hearings, Ms. Morgan's lawyer said his client's accounts were set up to handle legitimate revenue for her business and there is no evidence that she knew of any connection from incoming funds to illegal activity.</p><p>In 2016 Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan were living in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to friends. Mr. Lichtenstein was running an online marketing tech company called MixRank. Ms. Morgan at age 23 started SalesFolk LLC, which specialized in unsolicited marketing emails.</p><p>The two left for New York in 2017, where they worked to bolster their image as tech-savvy entrepreneurs. By the following year Ms. Morgan decided to pursue a different passion, she wrote in one Forbes column. She started making rap music under the name Razzlekhan. She described herself as the \"Crocodile of Wall Street.\"</p><p>In August 2019, the couple traveled to Ukraine for a monthlong trip, according to prosecutor filings. During that time, Mr. Lichtenstein, who holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, updated files on a cloud storage account that had information on money laundering and fake identity documents with Ukrainian connections, prosecutors said.</p><p>Lawyers for the couple said they had no intention of leaving the country, stressing that Ms. Morgan's frozen eggs necessary for in vitro fertilization are in New York. \"They would literally be leaving their future behind if they left,\" said Samson Enzer, one of the couple's lawyers, in the Monday hearing.</p><p>Every transaction of bitcoin is recorded in a public ledger for anyone to see -- resulting in huge volumes of data. Court documents show federal agents used software tools to sift through the data in search of connections and patterns, a process called cluster analysis.</p><p>One cluster of bitcoin addresses, identified in court filings as 36B6mu, caught investigators' attention.</p><p>On May 3, 2020, a fraction of a bitcoin went from the cluster to an exchange that sells prepaid gift cards. In return, a $500 gift card for Walmart was sent to a Russian-registered email. The transaction was conducted via an IP address linked to a cloud service provider in New York that investigators linked to Mr. Lichtenstein, according to the agents.</p><p>Portions of the gift card, filings said, were then redeemed through Walmart's phone app. Three purchases were conducted online using Ms. Morgan's name and the couple's apartment address was provided for delivery.</p><p>Between February of 2019 and December 2020, bitcoin worth about $7.8 million today flowed through the cluster to and from accounts at various crypto exchanges that investigators said in court documents are tied to Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan.</p><p>Investigating agents in January 2021 asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui in Washington to issue a warrant to search email accounts connected to the couple. Judge Faruqui approved the warrant in August, noting the public nature of the blockchain ledger meant that those using it had no constitutional right to privacy. Relying on cluster analysis to guide searches, he wrote, was akin to relying on a confidential source providing tips to investigators.</p><p>The judge wrote that cryptocurrency and related software analytics tools are the \"wave of the future, Dude. One hundred percent electronic,\" referencing a line from the movie \"The Big Lebowski.\"</p><p>On Jan. 5, federal agents showed up at the couple's Wall Street apartment with a search warrant. They seized a plastic baggie marked \"burner phone,\" more than $40,000 in cash and more than 50 electronic devices, according to court filings.</p><p>According to prosecutors' filings, the couple chose to leave the premises while the agents searched. They asked to bring their cat, which was hiding under the bed. As Ms. Morgan attempted to coax the cat out, she grabbed a phone from a nightstand, the filings said. She tried to repeatedly press the lock button, which prosecutors said appeared to be an attempt to keep investigators from being able to search it, and law-enforcement officials had to wrest the phone from her.</p><p>By then, investigators had access to Mr. Lichtenstein's email and cloud account, according to court filings. On Jan. 31, the government was able to break the encryption for several of the files. Among them was a spreadsheet listing various accounts, including some of those that had been abandoned when exchanges asked for identity verification in 2017.</p><p>Investigators also said they found a file listing all of the addresses within the digital wallet where most of the bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex were being kept. The currency, worth $3.6 billion, was seized. The seizure was visible on the blockchain ledger.</p><p>---</p><p>Ian Talley contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
