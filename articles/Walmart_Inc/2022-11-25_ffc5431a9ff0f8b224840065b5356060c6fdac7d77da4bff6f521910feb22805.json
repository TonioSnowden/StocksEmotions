  "title": "U.S. News:  Virginia Mourns Six Walmart Victims  ----  By Konrad Putzier, Bryan Mena and Catherine Lucey",
  "text": "<p>   CHESAPEAKE, Va. -- Families, friends and fellow workers on Thanksgiving Day were mourning six employees killed at a Walmart, allegedly by a night supervisor, in the second major mass shooting in America in less than a week. </p><p>   Police identified five of the dead victims as Lorenzo Gamble, Brian Pendleton, Kellie Pyle, Randall Blevins and Tyneka Johnson. The name of a 16-year-old male victim wasn't released because he was a minor. All six were Walmart associates, a company spokesman said. </p><p>   Several other people were injured in the shooting. A spokesman for Sentara Norfolk General Hospital said Thursday two victims remained in critical condition. A third victim was released Wednesday. </p><p>   The shooting occurred late Tuesday night during a busy Thanksgiving week in the city of Chesapeake, about 5 miles south of downtown Norfolk, Va. Police said Andre Bing, 31, opened fire with a handgun less than an hour before the store was set to close. At least 50 people were in the store at the time, police said. </p><p>   The suspect, who was carrying several ammunition magazines, then shot himself and was dead by the time authorities arrived, police said. A number of his victims were shot in the store's break room. </p><p>   A Walmart Inc. spokesman said the suspect had worked at the company since 2010. Authorities have yet to release a possible motive for the killings. </p><p>   Two people who had worked with Bing told The Wall Street Journal that he could be combative and difficult to work with and recounted how he would cover his cellphone camera with tape because he said he worried the government was tracking him. </p><p>   \"I always knew something was wrong with him, but I never thought he would do something like this,\" said Shaundrayia Reese, who said that she had worked at the Walmart until 2018. </p><p>   A memorial in front of the store grew in size Thursday, as locals placed orange pinwheels and flower bouquets on the ground. </p><p>   Virginia State Police officers and agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation were on the scene Thursday afternoon. </p><p>   A tow truck carrying six white wooden crosses each about 8-feet tall arrived Thursday afternoon and were placed next to the makeshift memorial. Matt Cilento, owner of Hickory Towing, said employees expressed to him that they wanted to show support for the victims and their families, so they came up with the idea of building the crosses. </p><p>   \"Hopefully, this brings a bit of closure to them,\" Mr. Cilento said of the victims' families. \"It's just terrible. You never expect something like this to happen so close to home.\" </p><p>   The Virginia shooting came days after an attacker opened fire on patrons at an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo., killing five. Authorities said he was shooting with an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle. </p><p>   The White House said President Biden and first lady Jill Biden called the club's owners to offer condolences and reiterate their commitment to fighting back against hate and gun violence. </p><p>   Speaking to reporters in Nantucket, Mass., Mr. Biden said that he was \"sick and tired\" of the shootings and that there was no reason semiautomatic weapons should be available for sale. </p><p>   Mr. Biden said he would continue to work on banning such weapons, saying that he would assess what is possible in Congress's lame-duck session. </p><p></p>",
