  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 25 points, or 0.6%, to 3991</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 added 142 points, or 0.4%, to 33703</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 climbed 116 points, or 1%, to 11851</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 211 points, or 0.63%, to 33537, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 36 points, or 0.89%, to 3957, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 127 points, or 1.12%, to 11196. The Nasdaq Composite is up 8.5% from its 2022 closing low hit on October 14, but remains down 28.4% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The Wall Street rally sparked by last week's softer-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation data was back on course, assisted by positive China-related news.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng HK:HSI jumped 4.1%, taking its gains so far in November to 24.8%, as Chinese listed stocks welcomed signs of cooling U.S./Sino tensions, Beijing's intentions to support its beleaguered property sector, and indications the mainland government would ease COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>The upbeat tone from Asia — which included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TW:2330 jumping 7.8% on news Warren Buffett had bought a $5 billion stake — underpinned European bourses and U.S. futures.</p><p>\"The injection of optimism inserted into the limbs of the financial market after last week's U.S. CPI report showed some signs of fading yesterday although there's been a recovery in Asia as China continues to support the economy and the interpretation of Biden/Xi meeting yesterday is spun a bit more positively in Asia,\" said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Analysts increasingly expect stocks to enjoy a positive end to the year. \"The near-term picture still looks positive for U.S. benchmark indices and while momentum has reached intra-day overbought levels, this doesn't imply a selloff has to happen right away,\" said Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.</p><p>\"It still looks possible to gain further this week with targets up near SPX 4050-75 and larger targets up near 4120. While I do expect that recent gains will require some consolidation, this might hold off until late week ahead of a push higher post Thanksgiving into early December. Overall, last week's surge keeps trends positive near term,\" Newton added.</p><p>However, Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said that while the latest developments in China were good news for the global economy they were \"bad news for global inflation\".</p><p>\"Rising Chinese demand next year, will put a renewed positive pressure on energy and commodity prices. Therefore, Chinese recovery, if materializes, will be the next battle in the global inflation war,\" she wrote in a morning bulletin.</p><p>That's a view likely not lost on Fed officials, who over recent days have been trying to calm the market's ebullient reaction to the latest signs of cooling U.S. price pressures.</p><p>Fed speakers on Tuesday include Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker talking about the economic outlook at 9 a.m. and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr testifying on regulation at the Senate Banking Committee, starting at 10 a.m. All times Eastern.</p><p>U.S. economic updates set for release on Tuesday include the producer price index for October and the Empire State manufacturing index for November, both due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Companies reporting earnings include Walmart WMT and Home Depot HD.</p><p>U.S. stock futures gain ground as positive China news lifts spirits</p>",
