  "title": "Embattled El Paso District Attorney Yvonne Rosales Resigns; Texas county's top prosecutor faced accusations of incompetence, misconduct in prosecution of Walmart mass shooting",
  "text": "<p>Her office has also been accused of being involved in manipulating and impersonating family members of a Walmart shooting victim.</p><p>In a letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Ms. Rosales said her resignation would be effective Dec. 14.</p><p>\"It has been an honor and a pleasure serving as the District Attorney of El Paso, Hudspeth, and Culberson Counties, so it is with a heavy heart that I tender my letter of resignation,\" Ms. Rosales said.</p><p>Ms. Rosales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Ms. Rosales, a Democrat elected in 2020, faced a hearing next month over whether she should be suspended, ahead of a trial scheduled for next year that could have led to her ouster from office. \"It is unclear who is running the office,\" Ms. Bernal, the county attorney and an elected Democrat, wrote in the amended petition for removal last week.</p><p>Ms. Rosales previously refused to comment on the allegations, which she characterized as the work of \"a cabal of power brokers and politicians\" who supported her opponent in her election.</p><p>The 2019 Walmart shooting that the district attorney's office is charged with prosecuting is one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. Patrick Crusius, then 21, is accused of traveling to the border city to target Latinos in the attack, which killed 23. He also is facing federal charges. He has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>During Ms. Rosales' 22 months in office, inaction by her office forced magistrate courts to release more than 320 people arrested for crimes including violent felonies, according to Ms. Bernal's petition. Similarly, Ms. Rosales' office failed to file indictments against hundreds of defendants released on bond, leading to case dismissals and the loss of bond provisions meant to keep victims safe, the petition says.</p><p>In an October response to the effort to remove her, Ms. Rosales argued she has discretion over such cases. \"It is the duty of a District Attorney to see that justice is done, not to rubber stamp every act of a police officer or Grand Jury,\" it said.</p><p>Write to Adolfo Flores at adolfo.flores@wsj.com and Elizabeth Findell at elizabeth.findell@wsj.com</p><p>Embattled El Paso District Attorney Yvonne Rosales Resigns</p>",
