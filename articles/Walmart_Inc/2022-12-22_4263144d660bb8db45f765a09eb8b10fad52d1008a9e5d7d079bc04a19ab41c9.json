  "title": "U.S. Jobless Claims Tick Up, Economy Grows Faster Than Previously Thought; Third-quarter growth of 3.2% reflects stronger consumer spending amid tight labor market",
  "text": "<p>New filings for unemployment benefits rose by a seasonally adjusted 2,000 last week but remain at historically low levels, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The 216,000 claims last week were in line with prepandemic levels, when the labor market was also tight, suggesting that employers are holding on to workers despite concerns about an economic slowdown.</p><p>In a separate report, the Commerce Department said third-quarter economic growth was stronger than previously estimated. The economy grew at a 3.2% seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from an earlier estimate of 2.9%, largely due to higher estimates of consumer spending. The third-quarter number snapped two consecutive quarters of contraction.</p><p>Taken together, the two reports point to an economy in expansion despite the Fed's aggressive pace of interest-rate increases. Fed officials are looking to cool the economy to bring down inflation, which hit 40-year highs earlier this year.</p><p>\"The labor market is still too hot from the Fed's perspective,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. \"Growth is slowing and particularly it's slowing in rate-sensitive industries like housing but I don't think it's slowing enough at this point.\"</p><p>Mr. Faucher expects higher interest rates will push the economy into a mild recession in 2023.</p><p>There have been early hints of softening. Retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in November from the previous month, the Commerce Department said earlier this month. Continuing jobless claims, which reflect the number of people seeking ongoing unemployment benefits, moved down by 6,000 in the week ended Dec. 10., but have slowly climbed since mid-September. That could be a sign that some unemployed people are taking longer to find new jobs.</p><p>Some big companies have announced layoffs in recent months as they grapple with the prospect of an economic slowdown and higher interest rates.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is planning to lay off thousands of workers, The Wall Street Journal reported, after hiring aggressively in 2020 and 2021. Several technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Lyft Inc. and Stripe Inc. have all announced job reductionsin recent weeks.</p><p>Other industries are also cutting back. Walmart Inc., PepsiCo Inc. and Ford Motor Co. have all recently announced layoffs.</p><p>So far, those announcements haven't led to a sharp rise in jobless claims numbers. Some of those recently laid off from tech and finance companies may not have filed an unemployment claim because they found new jobs relatively quickly. The number of available jobs in recent months continued to exceed the number of unemployed Americans seeking work.</p><p>Employers added 263,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said. Job growth has slowed from the first half of the year, a sign that employers are growing more cautious in an uncertain economic environment.</p><p>Employers are taking their time making job offers, said Greg Sulentic, owner and president of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency in Lincoln, Neb. That is a change from last year, when they were desperate to fill openings, he said.</p><p>\"There is still a great deal of need for clients to hire but they are a little more selective, a little slower to bring candidates in,\" he said.</p><p>The Fed raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage point last week, following four consecutive increases of 0.75 point. Officials signaled they would continue raising rates in the coming months to fight high inflation.</p><p>Consumer prices rose 7.1% in November from the previous year, the Labor Department reported this month. That was down from a July peak of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target.</p><p>Fed officials see the unemployment rate rising to 4.7% at the end of next year from 3.7% in November, according to economic projections released following their Dec. 14 meeting.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters after the meeting that an unemployment rate at that level would still represent a strong labor market. He pointed to Labor Department data showing that employers had 10.3 million job openings in October, more than the roughly 6.1 million people who were unemployed that month.</p><p>\"Companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it's been very, very hard to hire,\" he said. \"So you've got all these vacancies out there, far in excess of the number of [unemployed] people. That doesn't sound like a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work.\"</p><p>Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Jobless Claims Tick Up, Economy Grows Faster Than Previously Thought</p>",
