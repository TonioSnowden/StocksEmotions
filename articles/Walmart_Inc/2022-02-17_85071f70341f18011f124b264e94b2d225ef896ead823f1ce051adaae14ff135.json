As well Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine have accused government forces of opening fire on them. The U.S. and its allies have accused Russia of planning to use false reports of attacks on separatists as a pretext for an invasion.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak about “Russia's threat to peace and security” at a United Nations Security Council meeting at 10 a.m. Eastern time, the State Department announced.</p><p>“The market reacted this week as if something significant in the direction of de-escalation has happened, but that doesn't seem to be the case, and yet the market has only partially priced back in a higher level of concern,” said the Saxo Bank strategy team, in a note to clients.</p><p>“This geopolitical issue can remain the source of significant market volatility on fresh developments/headlines, especially ahead of the weekend if tensions are escalating again today or tomorrow,” said the Saxo team.</p><p>The uncertainty sent gold prices higher by 0.9% to $1,887.70 an ounce, with the U.S. dollar DXY modestly higher.

Fed officials will have another round of inflation and employment data before making their decision next month.</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Walmart Inc.WMT were in focus, rising 3% in premarket trade, after reporting fourth-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations and raising its dividend.</p>",
