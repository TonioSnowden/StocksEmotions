  "title": "Albertsons Seeks Online Safety With Kroger; A merger could help free up money for technology and logistics investment if it is approved by regulators",
  "text": "<p>Deal talks follow Albertsons' launch of a strategic review process earlier this year, less than two years after its initial public offering. Low valuation has been a sore spot for Albertsons, which has markedly improved its leverage since its public-market debut and continued to see healthy identical-store sales growth. In the past three quarters, its comparable-store sales growth exceeded that of Kroger's. Yet before news reports about the potential merger, Albertsons' enterprise value was 5.7 times forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, an 18% discount to Kroger on the same metric.</p><p>There would be good strategic reasons to combine. Pooling resources and capital would allow the combined company to splurge on initiatives that could help them compete better in online grocery, an arena that both were relatively slow to adapt to, at least relative to Amazon and Walmart. It would also give them better purchasing power, possibly allowing them to compete with Walmart on price more effectively, if they choose to pass on those savings to customers. Evercore estimates that cost synergies could range from $1 billion to $3 billion.</p><p>Albertsons has a strong incentive to ink a deal soon, given that the lock-up period for a substantial chunk of its shares ends Tuesday. Such an overhang comes with the risk that investors might seek to exit quickly all at once, putting pressure on the stock price.</p><p>Whether the deal can withstand antitrust scrutiny is another matter, given consumers' sensitivity to rising grocery prices. That may partly come down to how broadly the companies can define their market. Kroger and Albertsons are the first- and second-largest pure-play supermarket operators in the U.S. Yet their combined grocery market share is still dwarfed by Walmart. Walmart and its Sam's Club chains collectively own 20% of U.S. grocery market share, per Evercore estimates. Kroger and Albertsons combined have 12%. Richard Kestenbaum, partner at consumer and retail-focused investment bank Triangle Capital and an investor in Albertsons, argues that grocery-shopping behavior has changed so much that physical stores themselves are no longer the basis of the grocery industry.</p><p>Ultimately, the deal might get approved if the two companies divest overlapping stores. Evercore estimates that roughly 30% of Kroger's locations have an Albertsons within a five-mile radius, while about half of Albertsons' stores have a Kroger within that range.</p><p>Even after the rally on Thursday, Albertsons' share price implies an enterprise value that is 6.1 times forward Ebitda, cheaper than Kroger's 7 times multiple. Even if Kroger doesn't ultimately make the purchase, Albertsons could still offer value.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Albertsons Seeks Online Safety With Kroger</p>",
