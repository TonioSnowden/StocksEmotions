  "title": "Nasdaq drops 3% as tech rout sends S&P 500 back toward bear-market territory; Fed's Powell set to deliver remarks",
  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 409 points, or 1.3%, to 31,471.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down 85 points, or 2.1%, at 3,888.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP slumped 376 points, or 3.3%, to 11,159.</p><p>U.S. stocks finished higher on Monday, with the Dow industrials surging 618.34 points, or 2%, to 31,880.24. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Monday's climb for stocks followed the Dow industrials' longest stretch of weekly losses since 1932 and a temporary dip by the S&amp;P 500 index into bear-market territory last week. A close below 3,837.25 for the S&amp;P 500 would mark a pullback of 20% or more from the index's Jan. 3 record close, which would meet the traditional definition of a bear market.</p><p>But the Nasdaq Composite has led major indexes with year-to-date losses, down 28.2% through Monday from its record close of 16,057.44 reached Nov. 19, 2021.</p><p>Snap SNAP shares slumped 41% after the social-media company warned late Monday that it would likely miss quarterly estimates as the economy has \"deteriorated further and faster than anticipated.\"</p><p>\"That's stopped all the 'worst is over' pundits in their tracks. It highlights how fleeting swings in sentiment are now and that investors are running at the first sign of trouble,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.</p><p>Other social-media companies that rely on advertising as a revenue stream were also getting battered in premarket, with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. FB down 9.8%, Pinterest Inc. PINS tumbling 26%, Google parent Alphabet GOOG GOOGL off 7% and Twitter Inc. TWTR down 4.3%.</p><p>Opinion: Snap's warning of a weaker outlook sends ripples through tech stocks</p><p>The technology sector has particularly suffered this year as shares of companies that shot to popularity during the pandemic have retrenched amid a shifting economy. Also extremely sensitive to interest rates, the sector has also been unraveling in anticipation of higher rates from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"The market continues to turn itself inside out and back to front as it tries to decide if it has priced all of the impending rate hikes, soft landing or recession, inflation or stagflation, China, Ukraine, U.S. summer driving season, supply chains, the list goes on. The result is a day-to-day chopfest, and it seems clear that volatility is the winner,\" said Halley.</p><p>But it isn't all doom and gloom, with some market watchers arguing that last week's retail-led selloff after disappointing results from retailers Walmart Inc. WMT and Target Corp. TGTdidn't necessarily signal the U.S. consumer is in trouble.</p><p>\"We think it is appropriate to spend a minute looking at one thing that continues to go right for the U.S. economy (and which we are hopeful will prove to be a catalyst for a more constructive mood on Wall Street) and that is the consumer, as last week we learned April retail sales were up a robust 0.9% month to month,\" said Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Advisor Solutions, in emailed comments.</p><p>\"Even the extremely disappointing results out of Target —- and other retailers last week —- seem to have had less to do with end consumer demand, and more to do with mix of goods sold and cost inflation,\" he wrote. \"It has become difficult to maintain an optimistic view of things of late; but if the consumer is hanging in there, we think we should too.\"</p><p>In U.S. economic data, businesses expanded at the slowest pace in several months, reflecting the effects of high inflation, ongoing supply shortages and some softening in customer demand, according to the S&amp;P flash U.S. purchasing managers indexes.</p><p>Sales of new homes in the U.S. fell in April for the fourth month in a row to the lowest level since the pandemic, reflecting high prices and soaring mortgage rates. New sales slowed to a 591,000 annual rate from 709,000 in March, the government said Tuesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast sales to take place at a 750,000 annual rate.</p><p>Opinion: 'I feel like I am reliving the summer of 2008.' Strategist David Rosenberg sees bear market sinking the S&amp;P 500 to 3,300</p><p>Investors may be looking for more policy clues from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is due to give opening remarks at a Native American development conference at 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time. New home sales for April are due at 10 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Read: Guggenheim's Minerd believes fine art, real estate will outperform stocks, sees bitcoin bottoming at $8,000</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of Dole PLC DOLE fell 9.7% after the food distributor swung to a first-quarter loss and revenue fell short of estimates.</p><p>* Best Buy Co. BBY shares were up 0.2% after the consumer electronics retailer reportedfiscal first-quarter revenue that beat expectations.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>* The yield on the 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y note dropped 13 basis points to 2.73%, as investors sought safety in government debt.
