  "text": "<p>NatWest is pulling out of Ireland after more than a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27e1f8fe-cb23-4e5b-8281-dfe4ef38b5b9\">century in the country</a>, having posted a narrower than expected full-year loss for 2020.</p> <p>The lender set out plans to sell €4bn worth of loans to Allied Irish Banks following a strategic review of Ulster Bank. Staff involved in the day-to-day management of the loan book would transfer to AIB under a non-binding memorandum of understanding with NatWest, the companies said.</p> <p>Full-year results from NatWest delivered a £351m loss before tax, versus a £4.2bn profit in 2019 but well ahead of analysts' expectations for a £418m loss.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p>Public sector software maker <strong>Idox</strong> has received a £342.8m takeover bid from Dye &amp; Durham, a Canadian-listed legal technology specialist. Dye &amp; Durham said it had submitted three non-binding indicative proposals of 67p, 70p and 75p per&#xa0;Idox&#xa0;share in cash over the last fortnight. It made the announcement after Idox shares rose 13 per cent over the past five sessions.</p> <p>Magazine publisher <strong>Future </strong>said it expects profitability in its fiscal year ending September to be materially ahead of current market expectations. The company, which this month completed the acquisition of price comparison sites GoCo and Mozo, said online engagement had remained high in the four-month period ended January with continued momentum in ecommerce and digital advertising. </p> <p><strong>Segro </strong>posted an adjusted profit before tax of £296.5m for 2020, up 10.8 per cent. The business park owner reported record leasing and asset management performance with £77.9m of new headline rent in 2020. A bright outlook supported a 5.6 per cent increase in the final dividend to 15.2p per share, Segro said.</p> <p>Fellow warehouse developer <strong>Tritax EuroBox</strong> launched a share placing to raise £173m priced at 103p apiece, a 2.4 per cent discount to Thursday's closing price. The cash will be used to buy property in Germany and Italy as well as to develop existing sites, it said.</p> <p><strong>Daily Mail and General Trust</strong> has agreed to sell its Hobsons education technology business for around $410m in a two-part deal. Hobsons Naviance and Intersect businesses, which offer career advice and college matching services respectively, are being sold to US-based PowerSchool for about $320m. Its Starfish student communications unit will be spun out after an internal restructuring and sold to EAB for about $90m, DMGT said.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Vlad Tenev, the chief executive of <strong>Robinhood</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69c0b5b0-9d49-4d0e-8f32-fe9428bff5b1\">apologised</a> for his company's role in the furore over trading in GameStop shares during questioning from Democratic and Republican lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee in Congress. Here are the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3863ff7d-fa1c-4c62-a77a-55defcad11f6\">highlights</a> of the first hearing into the trading of GameStop that last month sent reverberations across the US stock market.</p> <p>The European Central Bank has shot down <strong>Deutsche Bank's</strong> plans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65e8ad5f-a134-405b-91c2-d79a426f3026\">to increase its bonus pool</a> by more than a third after Germany's largest lender reported a small profit for the first time in six years. People familiar with discussions told the Financial Times that Deutsche had initially planned to pay out more than €2bn in bonuses for 2020 compared with €1.5bn for 2019 but backed down in the face of stiff opposition from the ECB.</p> <p><strong>Walmart </strong>booked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfc585f0-882e-4eb9-9862-ca35873925d9\">record sales</a> in its holiday quarter as a fresh round of stimulus cheques and a slowdown in coronavirus cases encouraged Americans to spend on gifts and household goods. The world's largest retailer said demand in the US was strong across most key product categories, contributing to a 7.3 per cent year-on-year rise in overall revenue to $152bn, while the shift to online shopping drove up sales on its website by 70 per cent. </p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Merryn Somerset Webb</strong> <br>To invest with Woodford again you would need to be sure that he would make none of the mistakes he made in the past — or to be sure at the very least that he understands those mistakes. From what he has said so far that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51dc626f-009c-4e2e-a96d-44ea5e1ac714\">seems unlikely</a>.</p> <p><strong>Lombard <br></strong>Jonathan Hill is finishing&#xa0;his review&#xa0;of the UK's listing rules, with the final document due within weeks. But it's hard to see how the UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9161841-0678-43b5-a4bf-59dd17c13aee\">stops its budding tech names</a> taking a trip past Ellis Island in search of financial glory.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
