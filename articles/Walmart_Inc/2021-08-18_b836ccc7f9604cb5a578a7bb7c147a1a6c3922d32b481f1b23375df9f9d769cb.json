  "text": "<p>One reason may be that the stock is cheaply priced relative to earnings estimates. Another is that Kroger Co. KR is ramping up online sales; digital sales increased 16% in the fiscal first quarter ended May 22 from a year earlier and more than doubled from two years earlier. More growth could come from the food retailer's plans to build fulfillment centers to handle digital orders.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.BBRK.A purchased nearly 11 million shares of Kroger in the second quarter, according to its latest 13F report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That brings its stake to 61.8 million shares, or about 8.3% of shares outstanding as of May 22, the end of Kroger's fiscal first quarter.</p><p>Read:Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys Kroger, cuts stakes in drug makers</p><p>Wall Street doesn't like Kroger</p><p>While Berkshire appears fond of Kroger, which operates as Harris Teeter, Fred Keyer and King Soopers, among others, as well as Kroger, Wall Street is more skeptical.</p><p>Within the Russell 3000 Index, which represents about 98% of the U.S. stock market by market capitalization, there are only 10 companies in the “food retail” industry group, according to FactSet.
