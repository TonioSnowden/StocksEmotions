  "text": "<p>\"Unfortunately, there are a lot of fires in California these days, and we are super busy,\" he said, describing his efforts over the past few weeks. \"The people of the company are super hardworking, and I love working with them.\"</p><p>Close to 80,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. since the Afghan government collapsed as American troops were leaving last August.</p><p>According to a report published by the International Rescue Committee last month, about 41,000 of the resettled Afghans are working age and many have joined America's workforce. The average salary, based on a survey of 1,800 Afghan arrivals, was just over $16.50 an hour and the main hiring sectors have been manufacturing, retail and food services, the IRC data shows.</p><p>While many are beginning to restart their lives, others struggle because of difficulties speaking and learning English, a shortage of affordable housing, and limited support by overstretched U.S. resettlement agencies.</p><p>The Tent Partnership for Refugees advocates in favor of hiring refugees, and more than 100 major U.S. companies have signed up to join its network. Gideon Maltz, the executive director, estimates around half of working-age Afghans resettled last year have found jobs.</p><p>\"That first job is the way that they improve their English. It's the way they get exposed to American culture. And so, it's hugely important for us. We see that as a starting point,\" Mr. Maltz said.</p><p>Major companies like Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have emerged as key destinations for Afghans looking for their first job in America.</p><p>Walmart said it doesn't have data on the number of refugees it hires, but has been actively involved for years in welcoming Afghan arrivals to the U.S.</p><p>Ahmed Nabizada, a Walmart store manager in Virginia who oversees some 400 employees, made the transition himself when he arrived from Afghanistan about 20 years ago. He helped donate goods to Afghan families last year and continues to encourage them to adapt.</p><p>\"You've got to get out of your comfort zone, you know, move on, and accept the changes,\" he said.</p><p>Ofori Agboka, a vice president at Amazon, said the company launched a new program in April to provide benefits to refugees, including language and legal resources. He couldn't provide a figure for the number of Afghan refugees it has hired.</p><p>Alix Anfang, a spokeswoman at Uber, said the company has made its app available in the two primary languages spoken in Afghanistan, and hundreds of Afghans have signed up. Pfizer Inc. said it has committed to hiring 100 refugees this year through a dedicated portal, and to date has hired 72, including 60 Afghans.</p><p>Aman Khalili, who helped rescue then-Sen. Joe Biden after he was stranded with two other senators in a remote Afghan valley, is among those who have found work in Arizona at a construction company. He has settled there with five of his eight children, who have started school in the U.S. He is anxious for the remaining three -- adults struggling for survival in Afghanistan -- to join him in the U.S.</p><p>\"This month I will pay my rent with my own money,\" he said. He is grateful for the low-skill job, and he hopes one day to put his computer and accounting skills to use.</p><p>Mr. Samim's new employer, Bridger Aerospace, is an aerial firefighting company based in Bozeman, Mont., and founded by a former U.S. Navy Seal, Tim Sheehy. Mr. Sheehy served and was wounded in Afghanistan, and was eager to make the hire when he heard about the Afghan fighter pilot from one of his staff.</p><p>Operation Sacred Promise is a nonprofit dedicated to helping the roughly 260 Afghan pilots who reached the U.S. with their families. It guided Mr. Samim through the transition and says about a dozen more Afghan pilots are close to finding jobs.</p><p>The IRC data shows that Afghan women have entered the workforce at a lower rate, with just 14% of placements going to women. Many have weaker English language skills and lower rates of literacy.</p><p>Ahdia Hussein worked as a midwife in Afghanistan before escaping last year with her husband and their daughter, now 2. The family were resettled in Detroit, and she was afraid after learning that the city's crime rate was among the highest in the country. But after reaching Dearborn, Mich., home to a large Muslim population, she felt at home. She has started community college while her husband has found work in the tech industry.</p>",
