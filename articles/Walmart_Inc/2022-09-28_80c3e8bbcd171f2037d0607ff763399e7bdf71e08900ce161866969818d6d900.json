  "text": "<p>Now Julie, an emergency contraceptive pill out this week, will launch with a TikTok-video campaign and influencer promotions -- the clearest sign yet of blurrier marketing between female-health pharmaceuticals and other lifestyle products.</p><p>\"What we heard from women is that there is a second walk of shame,\" said Amanda E.J. Morrison, a Julie co-founder, of buying emergency contraception.</p><p>Hours after the Supreme Court's June 24 decision to end federal constitutional protections for abortion, morning-after pills were in limited supply or sold out at major retailers. Pharmacies and e-commerce sites, including Amazon, eventually put a cap on the number of pills a customer could purchase to prevent stockpiling.</p><p>The pills, which are legal in every state, prevent pregnancy primarily by stopping ovulation and can be purchased by consumers of any age at major pharmacies without a prescription.</p><p>The Julie brand will be sold at 4,500 Walmart locations across the U.S. and on Walmart's website, the retailer says, in addition to Julie's site. A Walmart representative declined to comment.</p><p>Packaged in a blue box with bright pink lettering, the Julie pill will sell for $42.44, priced below some competing brands but above generics.</p><p>Ms. Morrison said that in its use of TikTok, Julie intends to combat misinformation about sexual health and will create content with the help of its medical advisers: \"We want it to be fun and shareable.\" Her co-founders are Brian Bordainick and Julie Schott of skin-care brand Starface, whose cartoonlike pimple patches are designed to be worn in public.</p><p>Hey Favor, a direct-to-consumer provider of morning-after pills, birth-control pills, menstrual-care products and more, which does business as Favor, promotes a mix of educational and entertaining content on TikTok, which has more than one billion monthly active users, through its internal social-media team and influencer partnerships. \"We know that our patients and our target patient is really spending most of their time on TikTok,\" said Sarah Abboud, the company's director of communications.</p><p>When Get Stix, which does business as Stix, launched its Restart emergency-contraception pill this year, a promotional video from a news-focused TikTok account was viewed five million times and yielded thousands of product sales in a day, said Jamie Norwood, a co-founder of the company.</p><p>\"TikTok is the most used search engine for Gen Z, so we rely on the app to increase access to sex education that young folks can trust and rely on,\" Ms. Norwood said, adding that the company works with board-certified physicians to vet the information in its videos.</p><p>Rachelle Schwarz, a primary-care doctor with Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, cautioned that young people may see emergency contraception as an alternative to other forms of birth control.</p><p>\"They're risking pregnancy every time, and they're also risking STDs, which the morning-after pill does not protect against,\" she said. \"You'd have to give a lot of information to the patient, which I don't think would come across in something like a Facebook or an Instagram ad.\"</p>",
