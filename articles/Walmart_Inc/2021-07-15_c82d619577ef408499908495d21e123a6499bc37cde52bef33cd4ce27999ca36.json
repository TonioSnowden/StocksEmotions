  "text": "<p>Leading UK retailers are to encourage customers to wear masks in their stores after the government lifts most coronavirus restrictions in England, including the rule on face coverings in shops.</p> <p>From Monday, companies will no longer need to enforce government requirements on using masks or social distancing.</p> <p>Instead, ministers have set out new guidance for companies on Covid-secure workplaces in England that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa5cc7b7-25b1-4015-83f6-1280d2e03ab7\">leaves decisions </a>on detailed arrangements to individual businesses.</p> <p>Face coverings will not be required but the guidance says the government “expects and recommends that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces”. It also says there should be a staggered return to offices by staff after the lifting of the work-from-home rule.</p> <p>The big four supermarkets — Tesco, J Sainsbury, Asda and Wm Morrison — said they would encourage customers to wear face masks from Monday.</p> <p>Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, said: “We're asking our customers and colleagues to be on the safe side, and so from July 19 we'll be encouraging our colleagues to wear face coverings whilst they work and encouraging&#xa0;our customers to do the same when they shop with us.”</p> <p>Tesco will also continue to limit the number of people in stores, have protective screens at checkouts, and provide hand sanitiser stations.</p> <p>J Sainsbury, Asda, Wm Morrison, Waitrose and Aldi have all adopted similar policies, as have many non-food retailers such as Marks and Spencer, John Lewis and Primark. </p> <p>Many retailers are privately irked at effectively being asked to take sides in the debate over whether wearing masks and other Covid-secure measures should continue. “It's an invidious position to be put in,” said one. “The whole issue is very divisive”.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said there had already been a big rise in violence and abuse directed against retail workers and that “colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy”.</p> <p>The irritation is shared by other business leaders and trade unions, many of whom have described the government's new workplace guidance as confused and chaotic.</p> <p>Roger Barker, policy director at the Institute of Directors, described the guidance as “a series of mixed messages and patchwork requirements”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Return to work or continue to stay at home. Throw away your masks or continue to wear them. [The] long-awaited guidance from the government has done little to dispel that confusion,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the “back-to-work safety guidelines are a recipe for chaos and rising infections”.</p> <p>Several hospitality businesses said they will not require customers to wear masks and that it would be voluntary for staff.</p> <p>Pub groups including Greene King — which operates 2,700 pubs across the UK — said they would return to allowing customers to order at the bar and would drop social distancing arrangements as they look to maximise sales after being closed for the majority of the past year.</p> <p>“With confirmation from the government that restrictions will be relaxed on 19 July, we can finally look forward to getting back to what we do best,” said Greene King.</p> <p>Humphrey Cobbold, chief executive of the gym group PureGym, said masks would be optional but that cleaning regimes that included encouraging customers to wipe down equipment between exercise sessions would remain.</p> <p>According to a survey by the Night Time Industries Association, 83 per cent of nightlife venues will not require customers to show a “Covid passport” upon entry despite the government's recommendation that they do so.</p> <p>Michael Kill, chief executive of the NTIA, said the government's “ambiguous communication is creating hesitation amongst customers and operators. At this rate, ‘freedom day' will be a false dawn for a nightlife sector characterised by chaos.”</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses has received assurances from the government that small companies can insist on face coverings in the workplace given concerns that the guidance was not clear enough and left owners at risk.</p> <p>Craig Beaumont, chief of external affairs at the FSB, said:&#xa0;“It's important that the public realises that this is not a free-for-all — they must accept and respect the decisions that small business owners make about how to operate safely.”</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley, Daniel Thomas and Alice Hancock in London 2021 'Major UK retailers to urge customers to wear masks after July 19 ' FT.com 15 July.
