  "title": "Tesla Puts  Showroom  In Xinjiang  ----  By Liza Lin",
  "text": "<p>   Tesla Inc. has opened a new showroom in Xinjiang, the remote region where Chinese authorities are carrying out a campaign of forcible assimilation against religious minorities that has become a public-relations quagmire for Western brands. </p><p>   The Austin, Texas-based electric car maker started operations at the new showroom in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, the company said in a Friday post on its official account on China's popular Twitter-like social-media platform Weibo. </p><p>   \"On the last day of 2021, we meet in Xinjiang. In 2022, let us together launch Xinjiang on its electric journey!\" Tesla wrote in the post, which was accompanied by pictures from an opening ceremony that included traditional Chinese lion dances and people posing with placards reading \"Tesla (heart) Xinjiang.\" </p><p>   Tesla's China-based spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment on a public holiday. </p><p>   Widely admired in China, Tesla has expanded rapidly in the world's most populous country. With its most recent expansion, however, the auto maker risks wading into a reputational thicket that has recently ensnared other major American companies such as Walmart Inc. and Intel Corp. </p><p>   Researchers say authorities in Xinjiang have detained as many as a million Uyghurs and members of other Turkic Muslim minority groups in a network of internment camps as part of the government's assimilation campaign, which they say also includes mass surveillance, forced labor and stringent birth controls. The U.S. government, along with some lawmakers from other Western countries, has said that those policies amount to a form of genocide. </p><p>   Beijing has dismissed the genocide charge as a fabrication, describing its campaign in Xinjiang as an innovative effort to counter religious extremism and terrorism. </p><p>   In December, President Biden signed into law new rules banning most imports from Xinjiang over concerns about the use of forced labor. The White House has also sanctioned several companies and individuals it accuses of participating in the assimilation campaign. </p><p>   Xinjiang has quickly become a litmus test for foreign companies doing business in China. Those who embrace the region risk regulatory trouble and reputational blowback in their home markets, while those who shun it face the wrath of China's government and increasingly nationalistic consumers. </p><p>   Walmart became the most recent U.S. company to get caught in the political fallout as the year came to a close, after posts by Chinese consumers on social media alleged the retailer had stripped made-in-Xinjiang products from the shelves of its stores and those of its wholesale chain Sam's Club. </p><p>   China's discipline watchdog reprimanded the company for \"stupidity and shortsightedness,\" and Walmart faced calls for a consumer boycott online. The company declined to comment. </p><p>   American semiconductor firm Intel apologized to Chinese consumers on Dec. 23 following an explosion of online criticism over a letter the company sent to suppliers asking them to avoid sourcing products from Xinjiang. </p><p>   A closer parallel to Tesla, German car maker Volkswagen AG has faced criticism from lawmakers and human-rights activists outside China over its decision to maintain a factory in Urumqi. The company has defended its presence in the region, saying its supply chain there is free of forced labor. </p><p>   Tesla, which sells the Model S and Model 3 electric cars in China, has notched a string of successes in the country even as other Western companies face challenges from stronger domestic competition. It became the first foreign auto maker to build a wholly-owned production facility in China after signing a deal to open a factory in Shanghai in 2018. The company's China sales have continued to be resilient in the face of tightening regulations and negative publicity over the handling of some quality issues last year. </p><p>   Tesla delivered more than 930,000 vehicles globally in 2021, a surge of 87% compared with the year before, the car maker said Sunday. More than half of the vehicles it produced in 2021 were likely made in Shanghai, according to estimates by Credit Suisse. </p><p>   With the opening of the Urumqi showroom, Tesla's website shows it now has stores in 30 regions and provinces in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. </p><p>   Tesla founder Elon Musk is personally popular in China for his entrepreneurial acumen and maverick style. For his part, the South Africa-born entrepreneur has heaped praise on the Chinese government for its efforts to tackle carbon emissions and boost its economy, forecasting that China will become Tesla's largest market in the long run. </p><p></p>",
