TGT delivered a poorly-received earnings report, which sent its shares tumbling and weighed on other big-box retailers like Best Buy Co. BBY Investors were taken aback particularly because Walmart Inc.'s WMT earnings a day earlier painted a much more robust picture of the state of the U.S. consumer.</p><p>\"Target's signal that a consumer spending recession was unfolding heading into the all-important holiday shopping season came as a shock to some investors after yesterday Walmart reassured trends were ok,\" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab.</p><p>U.S. stocks came into Wednesday's session up six of the previous eight trading days, bolstered by last week's softer-than-expected October consumer prices report and Tuesday's weaker-than-forecast producer-price data, both of which raised hopes that the Fed might be less aggressive about raising interest rates than previously feared.</p><p>Katie Stockton, a market analyst at Fairlead Strategies, said stocks were ripe for a brief pullback, although technical factors suggest the major U.S. indexes will resume their uptrend as the holiday season in the U.S. gets under way.</p><p>Others on Wall Street worry investors have once again gotten too optimistic about hopes for an eventual pause of Fed interest rate hikes, and potentially have been concerned too little about U.S. recession risks.</p><p>See:'We've only just begun to see the layoffs and squeezes on profit margins,' warns Wells Fargo strategist</p><p>In the Treasury market, the 10-year note yield fell 10.5 basis points at 3.693%, while the 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, which is particularly sensitive to monetary policy, up marginally at 4.363%.</p><p>Several senior Fed officials also spoke on Wednesday, including New York Fed President John Williams who said the near $24 trillion Treasury market must be kept functioning smoothly, or risk turmoil that would undermine monetary policy, while speaking at an industry conference he hosted.</p><p>San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said Wednesday that the central bank's benchmark interest rate may have to rise above 5% to start to put downward pressure on inflation, with somewhere between 4.75% and 5.25% looking like a reasonable range.
