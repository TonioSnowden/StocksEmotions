  "text": "<p>\"Offering easy access to OTC hearing aids — something that seems quite small — is a solution that can improve our customer's health outcomes and their ability to live better and healthier,\" John Wigneswaran, Walmart's chief medical officer, said in a news release.</p><p>Walmart does not offer fittings, hearing tests, or hearing screenings at the vision centers, though some of its health centers provide audiology services, according to a spokesperson for the company.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA is also selling hearing aids, specifically the Lexie Lumen hearing aids developed by HearX Group, following a Food and Drug Administration decision in August that allows over-the-counter sales of the devices to begin on Monday.</p><p>Back in August, when the FDA finalized the rule, President Joe Biden said the regulatory change would bring \"nearly $3,000 in savings to American families for a pair of hearing aids and giving people more choices to improve their health and well-being.\" (Biden had issued an executive order in 2021 that asked the FDA to address over-the-counter sales of hearing aids, which can cost from $1,000 to $4,000 per ear.)</p><p>Sony Group Corp. JP:6758 has also developed hearing aids for the new over-the-counter market in the U.S. through a partnership with WS Audiology Denmark A/S, a privately held hearing-aid manufacturer. The first devices to come out of the partnership cost $999.99 and $1,299.99 and will be available on Sony's website. The CRE-C10 hearing aids — the less expensive option — will also be sold by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY, according to a spokesperson for Sony.</p><p>Walmart to begin selling hearing aids</p>",
