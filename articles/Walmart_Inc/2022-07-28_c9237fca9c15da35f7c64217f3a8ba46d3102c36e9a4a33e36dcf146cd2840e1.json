  "text": "<p>Strong revenue from the third-party segment helped Amazon salvage what was expected to be a bleak second quarter. Results for the period, released Thursday afternoon, showed third-party revenue rising 9% year over year to $27.4 billion. That was 6% ahead of Wall Street's expectations and helped cover for another slump in Amazon's online store division, which reflects the bulk of Amazon's own retail business. Revenue there fell for the third straight quarter and came in around $50.9 billion, 2% shy of analysts' forecasts.</p><p>The strength in third-party sales was especially helpful to Amazon's bottom line. Margins are higher than those for which Amazon is the merchant of record, since Amazon doesn't bear the cost of buying the products that it sells. The entire company's operating income for the second quarter came in at $3.3 billion—84% higher than Wall Street had projected.</p><p>Amazon's share price, which had slid 15% since its last report three months ago, jumped 13% after hours on Thursday following the results.</p><p>Amazon certainly isn't immune to the economic forces weighing down other businesses—especially traditional retailers. But the company's report, and its projection of double-digit sales growth resuming in the third quarter, was notably more optimistic in tone than a warning from retail rival Walmart earlier this week. Walmart slashed its profit outlook, warning that customers were curtailing purchases of general-merchandise goods to focus on food and gas. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call Thursday the company isn't seeing those same dynamics at play yet.</p><p>He also noted that Amazon is making \"solid progress\" on working its way out of the overbuild of its fulfillment capacity following the pandemic. Meanwhile, the company's AWS cloud business saw revenue grow 33% year over year to $19.7 billion, coming in slightly ahead of expectations. Amazon's advertising business grew 18% year over year in a period where a much larger advertising giant, Meta Platforms, logged its first-ever decline.</p><p>The news was good enough to help Amazon ward off the summertime blues.</p><p>Amazon Avoids Summertime Blues</p>",
