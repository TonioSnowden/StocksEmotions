  "title": "Macy's Boss Discusses Being an Openly Gay CEO and Trying to Break Groupthink; Jeff Gennette says retailer has made progress to diversify staff and suppliers, but struggles to retain diverse middle managers",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Gennette said he decided to be honest about his sexuality with his colleagues because he wanted to bring his authentic self to work. It is a philosophy that helped him climb through the ranks at Macy's and informs his leadership style now that he is Macy's chief executive. \"You're going to see opportunities for customers that maybe you wouldn't have otherwise if you had people who all looked the same or all acted the same,\" Mr. Gennette said.</p><p>When he became CEO in 2017, Macy's was in crisis. Sales were falling, and pundits were talking about the death of department stores, which were losing share to discount chains, fast fashion and online retailers.</p><p>Then the pandemic hit, upending Macy's business along with those of other retailers. Mr. Gennette temporarily shut Macy's nearly 800 stores and furloughed 90% of its 123,000 employees. More than a quarter of those jobs were permanently eliminated. Macy's lost nearly $4 billion in net income during the fiscal year that ended in January 2021 as sales plunged by almost a third from the prior year.</p><p>Macy's came out of the pandemic a smaller but more profitable company. It paid down debt and eliminated layers of management, which facilitated faster decision making. By getting team leaders to work more closely together and modernizing its supply chain by using more data and analytics, Macy's avoided the worst of the inventory glutthat this year tripped up other large retailers, including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp.</p><p>Mr. Gennette recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal via video from his office atop Macy's flagship store in New York City about his career and management style. Edited excerpts:</p><p>WSJ: It is July 5, 1983, your first day at Macy's and you decide to come out as gay. What led you to that decision?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: It was, did I want to keep my personal life separate from my professional life? What were you going to talk about when you went out to dinner or drinks or when you were doing assignments; did you talk about your personal life or not? It was a choice to be myself with my peer group.</p><p>WSJ: What was the reaction from your colleagues?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: There were definitely a couple of times when it was made known to me that it could be a deterrent in my career by being openly gay. There weren't many people who were. Certainly not in the ranks above me.</p><p>But even in my peer group, there were some people who I knew were gay but chose to not be open about it. I had a mentor who said, \"Hey, things are being said about you.\" It was a little uncomfortable that he was bringing it up in a way that suggested that maybe I should be less transparent about it if I wanted to get ahead in my career. I did not see it as anything that held me back.</p><p>WSJ: You talk about bringing your authentic self to work. What does that mean?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: It's your values, what you care about, what you have an opinion about. So you can authentically contribute to the dialogue, to the strategy, to the work that is being done. And you don't have to groupthink. You don't have to process it through another lens. You have a perspective that, if properly encouraged and you have the confidence and the talent, you can express it.</p><p>And that makes a difference in the decisions that we make as an organization. If you think about the diversity that we serve in America and you bring in how that is reflected in the management, you're going to make better decisions.</p><p>WSJ: How did the idea of authenticity help foster diversity and inclusion at Macy's? Can you talk about The Workshop at Macy's, where you provide suppliers with mentoring and tools to help them grow their businesses.</p><p>Mr. Gennette: Workshop was something we started 11 years ago to create opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses. It was the opportunity to train them, to get them ready. We help them with P &amp; Ls. We work with them through Babson College. We did that year after year. And it kept coming back to what if we did some funding for these companies, what if we put money up to help them get on their feet?</p><p>WSJ: So you launched another program in November 2022 called S.P.U.R. Pathways to provide up to $200 million in funding for underrepresented businesses in conjunction with Momentus Capital. What was the thinking behind that?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: These minority- and women-owned businesses have products that our customers want, but they just couldn't bring all the elements together to do it at scale.</p><p>WSJ: How about among your executives?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: WyQuasia King is a dress buyer. She is a member of the Divine Nine sorority, [a Black sorority system]. She worked with two of our major manufacturing partners and developed Divine Nine colors for the sororities from suits to dresses to accessories.</p><p>In addition to that, it gave us the opportunity to then give them funding for their scholarships and to be a part of that. So to enmesh ourselves in that community in a more deep and meaningful way than we were previously.</p><p>We would never have been on that if it hadn't been for WyQuasia coming in and saying to us, \"Hey, I've got an idea, let me run with this.\" And this thing now is well over $10 million in annual sales. We're now looking at the fraternities that are the complement to the sororities.</p><p>WSJ: When have your diversity efforts fallen short?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: The biggest challenge is we have this dropout at the middle management rank for diverse executives. More than 50% of our sales come from diverse customers, more than 50% of our hourly colleagues are diverse, and nearly half of our managers are diverse. And then you've got a very diverse boardroom. And we've got a pretty good diverse senior executive pool. When you look at the middle executives, at the director, the VP level, we have a lot of dropouts.</p><p>WSJ: How did you address that problem?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: In 2019, we created Mosaic, which is a leadership program. We take high potential, diverse talent and bring them the support they need, a mentor or coaching. We've had a much better track record of retaining this mid-management diverse talent. This is not an issue with gender. I'm very proud that with gender, we've been very strong there for many, many years. Our board of directors is 50% gender diverse. Four of my 10 senior managers are women.</p><p>WSJ: And yet, Macy's has never had a female CEO. Is that in the cards?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: I've got a couple of women that I've identified who could be CEO.</p><p>WSJ: Speaking of women, Macy's rolled out new benefits for its employees after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. You now reimburse travel for medical services that aren't available within 100 miles of their homes. How do you decide which social issues to weigh in on and which to stay quiet about?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: We have a responsibility now on certain issues to lean in, and it didn't used to be that way. It used to be that if you were serving America, just stay quiet about things that weren't related to your own knitting. Through the pandemic and a lot of what was going on with some of the societal issues, corporations were put on the stand to say, what is your stand on this?</p><p>We created a social purpose platform called Mission Every One that will invest $5 billion by 2025 to tackle some of the biggest challenges in our times: equality and equity for all people as well as climate change. As part of that, we created a group of advisers on societal topics and how they might affect our brand.</p><p>WSJ: When have you gotten it wrong?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: In the early days of Black Lives Matter, when Asian hate crimes and antisemitism were rising, we received feedback from our colleagues that they wanted to hear from us on these issues more quickly. We developed a process to determine when and how we show up and stay ahead on big societal topics.</p><p>WSJ: You have been with your partner for 31 years, married in 2011 when it became legal in New York and have a 23-year-old daughter together. When Congress passed a bill to protect same-sex marriage earlier this year, did you and your family do anything to celebrate?</p><p>Mr. Gennette: The three of us went to our favorite Brooklyn restaurant and toasted the occasion</p><p>Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@dowjones.com</p><p>Macy's Boss Discusses Being an Openly Gay CEO and Trying to Break Groupthink</p>",
