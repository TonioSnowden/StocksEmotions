  "text": "<p>Several department-store chains and specialty retailers last year posted profits that exceeded 2019 levels, as the pandemic helped them break a cycle of overbuilding, overbuying and discounting.</p><p>But with inflation near its highest level in decades, retailers are grappling with how to adjust their operations in case of an economic downturn. As major stock indexes have been in decline for weeks, analysts and investors are trying to gauge the health of consumer spending -- the engine of the American economy -- and where shoppers are putting their money.</p><p>While Target Corp. expected a sales slowdown from last year and more people shifting spending to services from goods, \"We didn't anticipate the magnitude of that shift,\" Chief Executive Brian Cornell said.</p><p>Some analysts revised estimates for retailers' financial performance after Walmart Inc. and Target last week posted weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings. Analysts said consumers are choosing more carefully how they spend their money. There is also a growing divergence between middle- and higher-income consumers, whose spending remains relatively strong, and lower- and fixed-income households under greater pressure from rising prices for grocery, gasoline and other necessities, they said.</p><p>The S&amp;P Retail Select Industry Index is down 32% this year, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Macy's has projected strong year-over-year sales growth in its April quarter but warned that the performance from 2021 would be hard to repeat. Sales from stores open at least a year are projected to increase 13.6%, according to analysts polled by FactSet, compared with the 62.5% growth a year earlier.</p><p>The department-store chain, whose quarterly report is due Thursday, likely benefited from an uptick in shopping for clothing as people return to in-person gatherings and the office and stronger sales of higher-price items, analysts say.</p><p>Government data showed U.S. retail spending grew in April for the fourth straight month. But because those numbers aren't adjusted for inflation, consumers may be getting less for what they are paying.</p><p>Kohl's Corp., another department-store chain, slashed its sales and profit targets last week after the company saw shoppers pull back. Chief Executive Michelle Gass said the company was adapting its business to navigate volatile conditions ahead, including leaning into its portfolio of lower-price, private-label brands.</p><p>\"Their wallets are being squeezed,\" Ms. Gass said about shoppers on a conference call with analysts. \"They're coming into the store, and they're being a bit more mindful of the brands they're buying and what's all going in their basket.\"</p><p>Visa's spending momentum index, which uses credit-card transactions to gauge consumer health, fell in April to its lowest level since February 2021.</p><p>Weaker sales of electronics and appliances could hit companies such as Best Buy Co., which had forecast comparable sales would decline in the first quarter from a year earlier. The electronics retailer reports earnings Tuesday.</p><p>Dollar General and Dollar Tree Inc., which report earnings Thursday, are expected to detail similar pressures on their profit margins.</p><p>Same-store sales for Dollar General are expected to decline 2.8% in the first quarter, and Dollar Tree's are expected to grow by 2.3%, according to FactSet.</p><p>An economic downturn could benefit dollar-store chains, bringing more shoppers seeking bargains, analysts said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
