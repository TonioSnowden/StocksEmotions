  "title": "U.S. News: Costco to Raise Its Hourly Minimum",
  "text": "<p>Later Thursday, theSenate parliamentarian issued a decision that the chamber's rules won't permit it toraise the minimum wageto $15 an hour as part of President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, complicating Democratic efforts to pass the increase.</p><p>Costco has long paid its store workers more than most competitors, in part to reduce turnover as part of its low-cost operating model. Costco Chief Executive Craig Jelinek said at the hearing Thursday that Costco's average wage for hourly workers is $24 an hour. Walmart's average U.S. wage after recent increases take effect will be more than $15 an hour, the company has said.</p><p>\"Although there's a lot of external focus on starting wages and minimums, it is important to us that Costco employees have an opportunity to make more than $15 or $16,\" he said, noting the company offers regular raises, bonuses and healthcare benefits. About 89% of workers are currently eligible for healthcare coverage, he said.</p><p>\"This isn't altruism,\" Mr. Jelinek said. \"It helps in the long run by minimizing turnover, maximizing employee productivity, commitment and loyalty.\" In the U.S., employees average more than nine years with the company, he said.</p><p>Compared with some big-box competitors, such as Walmart, Costco's stores tend to be close to higher-income, urban centers that typically offer workers higher wages generally. At Costco, shoppers pay a membership fee for access to discounted, bulk goods, a model that tends to attract higher-income shoppers willing to pay a membership fee and more each shopping trip for a large amount of goods.</p>",
