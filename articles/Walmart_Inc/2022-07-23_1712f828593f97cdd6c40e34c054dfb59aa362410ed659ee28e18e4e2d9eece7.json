  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc.'s top public-relations and public-policy executive, Jay Carney, is leaving the company to join Airbnb Inc. </p><p>   The move is the latest in a string of senior-ranking Amazon employees to defect from the company, and comes as Amazon faces heightened regulatory scrutiny. The company has faced criticism for a combative posture in Washington, D.C., that many executives at Amazon credit to Mr. Carney's style. </p><p>   The home-sharing company said Mr. Carney will start at Airbnb in September and will report to co-founder and Chief Executive Brian Chesky. Mr. Chesky said Mr. Carney is the \"perfect person to lead policy and communications at Airbnb,\" citing his work in government, technology and his time as a journalist. </p><p>   Amazon in 2015 hired Mr. Carney, a former longtime Time magazine reporter who had joined the Obama administration on the vice president's staff before becoming White House press secretary. While Mr. Carney has close ties to those in the current White House administration, his power at the White House was neutered during his tenure at Amazon. Mr. Biden, Mr. Carney's former boss, has often publicly criticized Amazon, and Amazon was often shunned at prominent White House events. </p><p>   Last year, Mr. Carney directed a frustrated message at Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, after Mr. Biden hosted the CEOs of Walmart Inc., Gap Inc., Lowe's Cos. and JPMorgan Chase Co., said people familiar with the exchange. Amazon wasn't invited. In December, Mr. Carney messaged Mr. Klain questioning him about a Politico article stating that Mr. Biden was embracing Amazon rival Walmart, The Wall Street Journal has reported. </p><p>   Airbnb has faced tough opposition from some homeowners and local lawmakers who say the company has eroded property values and brought house parties and crime to once-quiet neighborhoods. Mr. Carney will need to contend with these challenges, among other things, in his new role. </p><p></p>",
