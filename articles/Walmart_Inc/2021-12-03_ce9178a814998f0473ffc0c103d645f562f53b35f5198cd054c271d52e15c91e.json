  "text": "<p>\"Inflation is having an impact on customers,\" Rodney McMullen, Kroger's chief executive, said on a call with analysts. About 82% of consumers polled by Kroger's data-analytics team said they are feeling the impact of inflation and 25% of consumers said they aren't confident about their finances, he added.</p><p>The company said it is passing down costs to consumers where possible and is choosing to hold down prices in some areas. It is consulting its historical data to identify which items people are willing to pay up for.</p><p>Mr. McMullen said shoppers are still splurging in some cases and are looking for products with higher quality, even as those consumers search for ways to stretch their budgets. In response, the groceries chain said it is offering more personalized discounts, store brands and larger packs.</p><p>Kroger said its sales, excluding fuel, rose 3.1% at stores open at least 15 months from a year earlier, beating Wall Street expectations. Same-store sales rose 14% from two years ago.</p><p>The grocer also said net profit attributable to the company was $483 million, down from $631 million a year earlier. Earnings were 64 cents on a per-share basis, compared with 80 cents last year.</p><p>Kroger raised its adjusted earnings for the year to roughly $3.40 to $3.50 a share from $3.25 to $3.35 a share as it earlier projected.</p><p>Shares in Kroger rose 11% to $44.65 on Thursday. The stock is on pace for its largest percentage increase since Nov. 5, 2019, according to FactSet.</p><p>Kroger and other food retailers are recording lower profits, partly because they say they are spending more on sourcing and delivering products. Companies say they continue to wrestle with shortages of items such as pet food and beverages, and are spending more on freight, warehousing and labor to keep their shelves stocked.</p><p>Executives at Kroger said the company is using additional warehouse space. Packaged-food products are in shorter supply than fresh items and some manufacturers haven't brought back variety yet, they added. Merchandise costs, which include advertising, warehousing and transportation, rose 9% from last year to $25 billion.</p><p>Supply-chain challenges have improved slightly in recent weeks but haven't bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, industry executives say. Supermarket executives say they are securing food from a wider network of suppliers and storing more inventory to work ahead of supply issues.</p><p>These efforts are adding to overall costs in the U.S., fueling the highest inflation in three decades. Grocery prices rose 5.4% in October from a year earlier, with meat, poultry, fish and eggs increasing 12%. Pork prices climbed 14%, the highest annual increase since 1990. As meat prices remain high, consumers are switching to less costly types of meat or store brands. Retailers expect more shoppers to seek bargains in the coming months.</p><p>Still, consumer spending remains strong, executives say, and grocery sales are higher than they were before the pandemic, as people continue to work remotely and cook more at home.</p><p>Executives from Kroger, Walmart Inc. and other retailers met with President Biden earlier this week to discuss the supply chain. Also this week, the Federal Trade Commission said it is seeking information from grocers and retailers about how they are managing supply-chain challenges as the agency looks into higher prices and anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>A new Covid-19 variant is causing concern among supermarkets that rely on consumer-facing workers and are trying to keep up with steady demand. Some companies say they are waiting for more clarity on the Omicron variant before imposing significant changes and are also standing by to see how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's vaccine requirement will shake out. Many say they worry that either, or both, could worsen worker shortages.</p><p>---</p><p>Kimberly Chin contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
