  "text": "<p>Dr. Shah, 40, quickly learned that some problems couldn't be fixed with a scalpel or prescription. \"A lot of your job is to take broken pieces of the healthcare system and not necessarily put them back together, but find workarounds,\" he says on a video call from his home on the campus of M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass., where his wife, Julie Shah, is a professor of aeronautics and astronautics.</p><p>Instead of dropping out, Dr. Shah completed his medical training and went on to become a leading obstetrician-gynecologist and researcher in Boston. So some colleagues were surprised last summer when he joined Maven Clinic, a New York-based women's and family telehealth provider, as its inaugural Chief Medical Officer, overseeing clinical operations and strategy. \"I delivered my last baby in July, gave all my grants away, and made a bit of a pivot,\" he says.</p><p>Dr. Shah admits he had been \"enormously skeptical\" of digital health startups: \"I thought, 'I can't do a C-section through a screen. What is this?'\" But the move was an expression of his faith that seemingly sclerotic medical systems are actually improvable. \"I wanted to be able to build the things I was evangelizing,\" Dr. Shah explains. \"The idea of being part of a company that is creating a sustainable way of delivering care is really exciting.\"</p><p>Telemedicine has been around for years, but regulations governing where and how it could be used had long deterred both providers and consumers. The sudden demand for virtual medical visits in early 2020 led to a rollback of restrictions, and by last summer telehealth appointments had increased to 38 times pre-Covid levels, according to a report by McKinsey &amp; Co. An analysis by PwC found that health systems expect telehealth to make up around a quarter of patient visits in the next five years. Investment is surging, with companies like Amazon and Walmart becoming players in the market.</p><p>Since launching in 2014, Maven Clinic has become the world's largest telemedicine provider for women's and family health, supporting every aspect of reproductive care from preconception to early pediatrics.Through its app, the company gives patients 24-hour-a-day access to a \"care advocate,\" who answers questions and makes referrals to healthcare providers in hundreds of specialties and 30 languages. The company says it has supported more than 10 million women and families to date. \"Think of a mom who's struggling to breast-feed,\" says Dr. Shah. \"When you need help you need it at 3 a.m. We can connect you with a specialist within 30 minutes anywhere you are.\"</p><p>Maven's service is free to patients. Clients including Microsoft, Booz Allen Hamilton and L'Or√©al offer it to employees as a complement to in-person care, with the goal of lowering overall healthcare costs by addressing problems before they become crises. Childbirth and child rearing are the biggest ruptures to career trajectories, particularly among women, and Maven claims that employers who offer its service see a higher return-to-work rate and greater employee satisfaction. The company began serving Medicaid recipients in one state in January and plans to expand to others this year.</p><p>The pandemic helped to open Dr. Shah's eyes to the potential for telehealth. As doctors rushed to minimize in-person visits in early 2020, many began questioning the value of making pregnant women visit a doctor's office up to 15 times over nine months for a 15-minute appointment. Dr. Shah notes that women from poorer parts of Boston sometimes have to take three city buses to reach his own clinic, which deters some from coming at all. Half of all U.S. counties lack a single OB-GYN, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p><p>Dr. Shah hopes that Maven will move the needle on some of the more alarming trends in maternal healthcare by widening access to preventative care. The U.S. is the only rich country in which women are more likely to die from childbirth-related causes now than they were decades ago. The country's C-section rate has risen 500% in 50 years, but infants born at full term \"are 0% better off and moms are more likely to die. To me that's a really damning set of statistics,\" he says. By addressing risks like hypertension and diabetes earlier in pregnancy, Maven has been shown to reduce C-sections and visits to neonatal intensive care units, according to company data. The company also claims that members make fewer emergency hospital visits, which lowers costs for insurers.</p><p>Maven's network of providers is also racially diverse, which Dr. Shah suggests could help narrow some racial gaps in maternal health outcomes, such as the fact that Black women in America are up to four times more likely to die of childbirth-related causes than white women. This mortality gap can be explained partly because women of color tend to be poorer and in poorer health, but it is also because they often have to advocate for themselves more than white women to receive proper treatment, surveys have found. \"Nearly every story with Black maternal mortality is about someone who expresses concern about their pain but wasn't heard or responded to or believed,\" he says.</p><p>Dr. Shah admits it was a little painful to give away his grants and retire his surgical gloves: \"I can open a clamp with my left hand, I can tie a knot in like three seconds. These skills were really important six months ago. Not anymore.\" To stay in touch with the people he is trying to serve, Dr. Shah still sees patients a few hours a week. But he is excited by the potential of telemedicine to reach more women wherever they are. \"It's going to be normative in the next couple of years to use your phone for health,\" he says. \"Geography shouldn't be a constraint for getting better care.\"</p><p>Obstetrician Neel Shah Joined the Telehealth Revolution</p>",
