  "title": "MANSION --- Rocky Mountain High Prices --- Rather than slowing down as pandemic restrictions have eased, the market for ultrahigh-end homes in Aspen has only accelerated",
  "text": "<p>The engaged couple got serious about buying a property around six months ago, Mr. Rogers said; they wanted to escape the summer heat at their primary home in Georgia and have a place where their four young sons could ski. When they made an offer on a house they were renting near downtown Aspen, it looked like they had a deal -- until the owners changed their minds about selling. Their offer on another home was rejected because it didn't meet the seller's \"astronomical\" price expectations, said Mr. Rogers. Finally, they found a mountaintop mansion owned by former Priceline.com CEO Richard Braddock. They offered $40 million, just shy of the $44.5 million asking price, and promised to close quickly. Even then, Mr. Braddock's representatives reminded them that there was a backup offer, Mr. Rogers said.</p><p>\"That's the fastest I've ever bought a residential property before. And I do real estate for a living,\" said Mr. Rogers, whose company, Landmark Properties, is one of the country's largest developers of student housing. \"We had to get aggressive.\"</p><p>His experience is typical for high-end Aspen buyers at the moment, local agents say. The luxury market in the affluent mountain destination has been supercharged by low inventory, tight restrictions on new construction and an influx of uber-wealthy buyers. Many of these buyers, spurred by the pandemic and remote work, are looking for a more laid-back lifestyle in an area known for its ski resorts, designer stores and upscale dining, agents said.</p><p>Since Covid, a similar narrative has unfolded in wealthy, inventory-constricted markets across the country, such as Palm Beach, Fla., and Malibu, Calif. These markets have only a small number of homes in the most sought-after locations, and restrictions on new construction mean few more will be built. In Palm Beach and Malibu, billionaire buyers are competing for frontage on the beach. In Aspen, which is about 150 miles from Denver with a population of roughly 7,000, they are clamoring for Rocky Mountain views and access. Rather than slowing down as pandemic restrictions have eased, the market for top-tier homes in these locations has only accelerated, as the ultrawealthy benefited from a rise in stocks.</p><p>The market for top-tier homes across the country has begun to operate independently from the rest of the market, said appraiser Jonathan Miller, who compared the ultraluxury market to a \"circus sideshow.\" In 2021, there were 48 sales across the country priced at $50 million or up, Mr. Miller said, compared with just 29 in 2020. These buyers often have homes in multiple markets -- often New York, L.A., South Florida and Aspen -- and are largely unaffected by the rising interest rates that have begun to slow the real-estate market at lower price points, he said.</p><p>\"It's fantasy real estate, even if it's real,\" Mr. Miller said.</p><p>There were 37 Aspen single-family homes on the market in April 2022, a 64% drop from 102 in April 2021, according to data from real-estate agent Carrie Wells of Coldwell Banker Mason Morse. Meanwhile, the average price for Aspen single-family homes year-to-date is around $15.78 million, up from $10.7 million in 2021, Ms. Wells said.There have been 39Aspen home and condo sales over $10 million this year through May 31, roughly 50% more than during the same period last year, according to Tim Estin of Aspen Snowmass Sotheby's International Realty.</p><p>Wealthy Aspen buyers come from all over the country and from an array of different industries, agents said.Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield and his wife, Away co-founder Jen Rubio, purchased a roughly $25 million, six-bedroom house in Aspen's Five Trees neighborhood in January 2021, records show. Also last year, Patrick Dovigi, a retired professional hockey player turned entrepreneur, set an Aspen record when he paid $72.5 million to buy a roughly 22,000-square-foot compound from Lewis A. Sanders, founder of the New York investment firm Sanders Capital. Mr. Butterfield, Ms. Rubio, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Dovigi didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Agents say they are sending out mailers and cold-calling homeowners to persuade them to sell. As such, many of the major transactions are closing off-market, creating a shadow market accessible only to those in the know.</p><p>Homeowners who do sell can basically name their price, agents said. Among these reluctant sellers was fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who agreed to part with his ski-in, ski-out Aspen mansion for $50 million in March. He and his wife, Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger, had purchased it just three months earlier for about $31 million.The couple never intended to sell, Mr. Hilfiger confirmed. They had spent years searching for a home to remodel before settling on the roughly 7,150-square-foot property on Aspen Mountain, according to their agent, Steven Shane of Compass, but a buyer brought them an offer that seemed too good to be true. He declined to identify the buyer.</p><p>Mr. Shane said he recently closed a deal after a casual conversation with fellow broker Craig Morris of Aspen Snowmass Sotheby's International Realty. Mr. Morris mentioned that his client, GoDaddy founder Bob Parsons, was contemplating listing his home in the Pearl Court area of Aspen. The property, which included a vacant lot next door, never made it to market: less than a week later, it was in contract to sell to Mr. Shane's client, who scooped it up by offering $42.925 million. Mr. Parsons had paid $15.32 million for the property in 2017, plus roughly $4.5 million for the adjacent parcel. Mr. Parsons couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>Mr. Morris also recently worked on a $30.8 million off-market deal for a parcel of land near Aspen's Roaring Fork River. The deal was one of the highest prices ever paid for undeveloped land in the Aspen area. Records show the seller was billionaire Walmart heir Rob Walton, who couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>In May, a trio of deals illustrated just how heated Aspen's high-priced game of musical chairs has become.Todd Lemkin, chief investment officer at the investment firm Canyon Partners, and his wife, Kasey Lemkin, sold their downtown Aspen home for $32.25 million and traded up to a nearby contemporary mansion, paying $60 million. The couple didn't respond to a request for comment. The sellers, real-estate investors Christy Thompson and Stephen Hill, hadn't intended to sell, according to their agent, Liz Leeds of Slifer, Smith &amp; Frampton and REALM. They went on to purchase a $51 million house from venture capitalist Lawrence F. De George.</p><p>Price growth in Aspen has been fueled in part by the city's restrictive development policies, agents said. The city council limits development of new homes, agents said, and a moratorium on certain kinds of residential development was reinstated this year. \"The city is making it harder and harder to build and consequently more expensive,\" said real-estate agent Tal Alexander of Douglas Elliman.</p><p>Aspen Mayor Torre (who has no last name) said the moratorium was a temporary measure until the city's land use code could be adjusted. An earlier development boom led to escalating prices and pressure on the local workforce, he said.\"We're not against the wealthy,\" he said. \"We just have to strike a balance.\"</p><p>In Pitkin County, landowners hoping to build new homes must buy \"transferable development rights,\" or TDRs, to expand their properties beyond a certain size. Driven by a lack of supply, the price of a TDR had risen from $360,000 in 2020 to roughly $2 million by the end of last year, according to Suzanne Wolff, assistant director of Pitkin County Community Development.</p><p>Mr. Rogers said while $40 million was a high price to pay for his home, he didn't think he could build a similar property for close to that amount.</p><p>\"We felt that in the long run, it would be a good store of value,\" he said.</p>",
