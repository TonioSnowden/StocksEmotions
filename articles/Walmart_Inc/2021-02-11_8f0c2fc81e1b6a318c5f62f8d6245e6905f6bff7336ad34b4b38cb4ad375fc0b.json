  "title": "Billionaire Asda buyers raise £2.75bn in record sterling junk bond sale",
  "text": "<p>The private equity-backed billionaires buying Asda have raised the largest-ever sterling junk bond, with investors piling in to the £2.75bn debt sale backing the UK's biggest leveraged buyout in more than a decade.</p> <p>The new junk bond is the centrepiece of an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c65e8172-94c5-46ce-b895-a327dbd9b119\">intricate series</a> of debt deals and asset disposals through which Blackburn-based brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and the private equity firm TDR Capital will acquire the grocery chain for £6.8bn.</p> <p>While this structure has allowed the new buyers to put up only a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79964b33-2406-41c8-8f24-4ff5552f1669\">thin sliver</a> of their own equity, the £2.75bn bond sale drew more than £8bn of orders from investors, who were enticed by Asda's relatively low debt burden and the £9bn of property value underpinning the deal.</p> <p>“It was always going to be a blowout deal,” said Vivek Bommi, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “It's an easy business model and reasonably levered.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The strong demand for the deal demonstrates the scale of borrowing now possible in the sterling high-yield bond market, which has historically had shallower liquidity than its euro and dollar counterparts. The deal's £2.25bn secured tranche — the portion that is backed by Asda's assets — is also the largest single European junk bond issued in any currency, eclipsing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3cecdc6-9a90-3cfa-8ea5-e728a8014ff9\">previous euro-denominated deal </a>from Italian telecoms company Wind.</p> <p>“It has definitely opened people's minds in terms of the art of the possible,” said Na Wei, a managing director at Barclays, which led the transaction, adding that the deal was originally underwritten with a more conventional split between sterling and euros.</p> <p>Strong corporate bond markets on both sides of the Atlantic have allowed companies to lock-in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45770ddb-29e0-41c2-a97a-60ce13810ff2\">record-low borrowing costs</a> this year, particularly for businesses little affected by the coronavirus crisis, such as food retailers. Still, credit rating agencies rank Asda below investment-grade: it carries a double-B rating, putting it in the upper echelons of the junk bond market.</p> <p>The strong demand for the deal allowed Asda to price the new bonds at a 3.25 per cent coupon on the secured tranche and 4 per cent on a riskier £500m unsecured bond, only a small amount of additional premium given its lack of specific claims on the supermarket's assets in case of default. Asda also raised a €845m <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fa9a75e-1b0e-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\">“covenant-lite”</a> loan, which offers fewer investor protections than borrowings of this type have traditionally provided, priced at 2.75 per cent above a floating-rate benchmark.&#xa0;</p> <p>In a reflection of the dearth of returns on offer in the junk bond market, analysts at CreditSights recommended buying Asda's debt even though they viewed the final pricing as relatively expensive and “borderline uninvestable”, arguing that it still offered higher yields than other bonds from food retailers.</p> <p>“We are pleased to have secured debt financing for the acquisition of Asda at attractive rates, following exceptional levels of investor demand,” the Issa brothers and TDR said in a statement. “The debt financing forms part of a robust capital structure that we are putting in place for Asda, to support and accelerate the growth strategy for the business.” </p> <p>The Issa brothers and TDR struck a deal to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a978525-d0cc-4a14-ba83-63732ee14067\">acquire Asda</a> from US retail juggernaut Walmart in October. The two entrepreneurs and their private equity partners have spent the past five years transforming EG Group into one of the world's largest petrol pump businesses through a break-neck series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/356acc82-fb11-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229\">debt-funded acquisitions</a>.</p> <p>While Walmart is retaining an investment in the business, the Arkansas-based company's £500m stake is classed as “senior equity”. This means it ranks ahead of the Issa brothers and TDR in an insolvency, and the US retailer also receives an annual dividend that ordinary shareholders do not.&#xa0;</p> <p>Asda will continue to benefit from Walmart's buying power under a “global sourcing agreement”, but the US company is charging a 5 per cent fee linked to the purchase of any merchandise it procures for the UK chain. The agreement also has an initial term of only two years, meaning this rate of commission will have to be renegotiated if the deal is extended.</p><p>Source: Robert Smith, Nikou Asgari and Kaye Wiggins in London 2021 'Billionaire Asda buyers raise £2.75bn in record sterling junk bond sale' FT.com 11 February.
