  "title": "FedEx to Raise Shipping Rates",
  "text": "<p>Inflation in the U.S. has been hovering near four-decade highs. Energy prices have declined in recent weeks, though they are still above year-ago levels. FedEx offsets some of those costs with fuel surcharges.</p><p>The company is raising rates at a time it and others are suddenly stuck with excess capacity. Ocean freight rates have plunged during what is typically the industry's peak season after cargo owners shipped holiday goods early and inflation dented consumer demand.</p><p>The average number of packages FedEx handled daily in the quarter ended Aug. 31 fell 11% from the prior year, the third straight quarter of declines. Increases in fees like fuel surcharges helped boost FedEx's revenue despite the decline in volumes. However, operating expenses weighed on the company's profit margins.</p><p>FedEx's rate move was announced Thursday as part of its first-quarter earnings report, which showed profit fell 21% from a year earlier and that it is planning additional cost cuts. The company said it expects to generate between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion in savings this fiscal year from a plan announced last week to park aircraft, suspending Sunday deliveries and closing some offices. It also plans to wring an additional $4 billion in annual costs from its operations over the next two years.</p><p>FedEx's results were released before the market close on Thursday, about 90 minutes ahead of schedule, which a company spokeswoman said was the result of a technical glitch. Shares in FedEx closed trading up less than 1%.</p><p>FedEx Chief Executive Raj Subramaniam, who took over the role from founder Fred Smith on June 1, faced questions from analysts Thursday about the company's view that the macroeconomic environment is the primary reason for its recent performance.</p><p>\"What we did not anticipate, to be perfectly honest with you, was the tremendous inflation of costs that hit us squarely last year,\" said Mr. Subramaniam. \"That was what really got us.\"</p><p>He said FedEx had to expand capacity to meet demand and now faces a different situation. \"Now we have more capacity than we need,\" he said. \"Could we have timed that a little better? I don't know, you can't calculate it. You can't build half a building.\"</p><p>FedEx's chief customer officer, Brie Carere, pointed to the recent plunge in costs to ship cargo on ocean trade routes from Asia to bolster the company's defense that macroeconomic pressures were mostly responsible for the earnings miss.</p><p>Executives also were pressed by analysts on the company's progress in efforts to make its delivery networks more efficient. Activist investor D.E. Shaw Group has pushed the company to boost profit, and Mr. Subramaniam, who previously served as FedEx's operations chief, has pledged to make the operating structure more efficient and increase profit margins.</p><p>FedEx executives said the company will generate big savings from reducing flights. They said there are plans to idle eight narrow-body aircraft in response to lower volumes, and to reduce flight frequency by around 10%.</p><p>FedEx said Thursday it expects to save this fiscal year between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion in its Express business by reducing flight frequencies and parking aircraft. It expects to save up to $500 million in its Ground business from closing sorting operations and stopping some Sunday deliveries. It expects to cut up to $500 million from overhead, such as closing FedEx Office and corporate office locations.</p><p>Delivery companies, including FedEx, UPS, the U.S. Postal Service and Amazon.com Inc., are slated to handle about 92 million parcels a day in the time frame that corresponds with the holiday-shopping season, but they have the capacity to handle about 110 million parcels, said Satish Jindel, president of research firm SJ Consulting Group.</p><p>Carriers scrambled to increase package-handling capacity in earlier months of the pandemic as businesses dealt with a jump in online purchases. A pullback in online orders occurred faster than carriers and many retailers expected. Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. sounded alarms this spring that their stores and warehouses were holding too much inventory after they stepped up orders to avoid supply-chain delays at the same time that demand slowed rapidly.</p><p>FedEx Express, the company's biggest unit by revenue, flies time-critical packages overnight for customers. The spending slowdown and order reductions meant customers didn't need to pay as frequently for fast air-shipping. FedEx Express revenue in the August quarter was about $500 million lower than it planned, the company said.</p><p>---</p><p>Cara Lombardo contributed to this article.</p>",
