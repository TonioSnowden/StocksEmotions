  "text": "<p>Some people on Twitter criticized the timing of the deal, announced Tuesday, and Black Rifle Coffee's gun-centric branding. The shooting in Highland Park., Ill., had occurred a day earlier. A gunman fired from a rooftop at an Independence Day parade and killed seven people.</p><p>Other people praised the Cowboys deal with Black Rifle, noting that the sports franchise was supporting a veteran-owned company.</p><p>The Cowboys posted a video about the deal on Twitter Tuesday showing an American flag, player footage and a man in camouflage drinking coffee.</p><p>\"Please welcome America's Coffee to America's Team,\" the Cowboys wrote on Twitter, referencing the team's nickname.</p><p>Jerry Jones, the team's owner, said that the partnership would help veterans and first responders.</p><p>\"Every cup of coffee in the stadium, every bag of Cowboys coffee sold, represents a step in fulfilling the Black Rifle mission,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>The Cowboys spokesman said that Black Rifle approached the team about the deal, which will make its drinks the team's official coffee. He didn't say how long the partnership would last.</p><p>Evan Hafer, Black Rifle's founder and chief executive, said in a statement Wednesday that he looked forward to a great season.</p><p>\"The Dallas Cowboys and Black Rifle Coffee share an unwavering commitment to supporting veterans and first responders,\" Mr. Hafer said.</p><p>This isn't the first time the Cowboys have waded into a polarizing situation. After some National Football League players joined Colin Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem in 2016, Mr. Jones, the Cowboys owner, forbade his playersfrom doing so.</p><p>Last month, the Cowboys said that it would donate $400,000 to funds for victims of the Uvalde shooting, in which a man armed with a rifle killed 19 students and two teachers at a Texas elementary school. The attack, as well as a mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket 10 days earlier, reignited conversations around gun control.</p><p>Salt Lake City-based Black Rifle was founded in 2014 by an Army veteran and started trading as a public company in February. The company is an outspoken supporter of the police and the military. It regularly posts images on social media featuring its coffee alongside guns, American flags and people wearing camouflage.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think of the Cowboys' deal with Black Rifle Coffee? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Black Rifle Coffee has also sponsored Nascar drivers and partnered with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. In addition to offering its products on its website, the company has several bricks-and-mortar stores and sells its items at Walmart Inc. and Bass Pro Shops.</p><p>The Cowboys deal comes as sports are becoming more politicized, an opportunity that Mr. Jones may be seizing to bolster the Cowboys' image as \"America's team,\" said Dr. Stefan Szymanski, a sports management professor at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Black Rifle has made moves in recent years to attract consumers who support its message. The company said last week that it had partnered with Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video to feature its products on \"The Terminal List,\" a show about a U.S. Navy SEAL.</p><p>\"It's certainly an aggressive move,\" said Rick Burton, a sport management professor at Syracuse University, of the Cowboys choosing to partner with Black Rifle Coffee. He said the Cowboys could try to wave off criticism of the deal by playing it down as one of many partnerships.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Dallas Cowboys Face Backlash After Partnering With Gun-Themed Coffee Company</p>",
