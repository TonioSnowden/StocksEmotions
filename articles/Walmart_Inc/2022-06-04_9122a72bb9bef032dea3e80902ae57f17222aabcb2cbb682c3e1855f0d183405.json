  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Taking Inventory Of a Shopping Shift --- Americans are getting out and about, for work and play. But stores are stocked like we're still holed up at home.",
  "text": "<p>The pandemic caught everyone by surprise, spurring profound changes, and some of them looked like they would be permanent. All of a sudden, though, the solid ground American companies and investors thought they were running on has turned into a cloud of dust.</p><p>The change is more than a little disorienting. On the one hand, the stock market has sold off deeply, with some big companies like Walmart sending caution signals on the staying power of the American consumer. On the other hand, the job market remains strong, overall spending figures remain robust and, even after accounting for inflation, many Americans have stockpiled savings since the Covid-19 crisis struck.</p><p>Maybe the disconnect is just a matter of the economic data catching up with what the stock market and many public companies seem to be saying. There is little doubt that the economy will grow more slowly this year than last, particularly as the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases begin to be felt. The housing market is already taking a hit. We also know that lower-income households in particular are feeling the pinch from rising fuel and food prices, leaving them with less money to spend elsewhere.</p><p>But a larger factor behind the mixed economic signals might simply be that more people are moving back toward their prepandemic patterns of living. For companies that bet people would keep working remotely, stocking up on home goods and favoring purchases of sweatpants over dress pants, that is jarring. Now those companies are sitting on too much of the wrong kind of inventory with higher staffing levels than they need to meet demand. The transition could be rocky.</p><p>When Walmart reported disappointing results last month, sending its shares sharply lower, the big retailer said that higher food costs were leading to a shift in spending away from general merchandise. It also said people were economizing on groceries, moving toward private-label brands and even switching from gallons of milk to half-gallons.</p><p>But some of these changes in behavior might have nothing to do with belt-tightening. Take those half-gallon milk purchases, for example. Economizing is one reason, but for some people it might be that when they spend less time at home, the gallon of milk in the refrigerator doesn't get finished before it goes bad. The amount of milk Americans bought in the three months that ended in April, adjusting for inflation and seasonal swings, was 5.6% lower than in the previous three months, according to the Commerce Department -- but was still higher than before the pandemic. Similarly, consumer purchases of toilet paper, paper towels and other household paper products have slipped. That probably isn't because people are limiting themselves to fewer squares to save a bit of money. They aren't in the house as much.</p><p>This presents a challenge not just to stores like Walmart that sell food and other household products, but to the constellation of companies that supply them. Their employees could soon face a hit too: Labor Department figures show employment at food and beverage stores rose sharply during the pandemic, for example. If people continue to spend more days at the office and re-engaging in activities such as dining out, some supermarket workers might have to find work elsewhere.</p><p>Many retailers and other consumer-facing companies could face severe inventory problems. When it reported results last month, Target said that, as people rushed to buy luggage, they bought fewer things such as kitchen appliances and televisions, leaving the retailer with too many of those items on hand. Apparel retailers have found that customers are spending more on clothes for going back to the office and out socializing. Sales of comfort-focused clothes aren't doing as well, leaving them with excess inventory to unload.</p><p>Commerce Department figures show the overall inventory-to-sales ratio for retailers stood at just 1.16 in March compared with a 2019 average of 1.47. But a big factor behind that low reading is the continued supply-chain issues vexing the auto industry, leaving car lots with extremely low inventories. Inventory-to-sales ratios actually are above prepandemic levels at furniture, electronics and appliance stores, and at general-merchandise stores (a category that includes stores such as Walmart as well as department stores).</p><p>A further complication is that some companies built out too much of what is now the wrong kind of capacity. Peloton Interactive, which expanded its manufacturing capacity as people clamored for bikes and treadmills, is a prominent example, but it isn't alone. Amazon.com, for instance, expanded warehouse and delivery capacity in response to a pandemic-driven jump in online spending. In April it said that it had excess capacity in its fulfillment and transportation network.</p><p>As weird as returning to prepandemic activities might feel for consumers, it is even more jarring for companies that serve them.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
