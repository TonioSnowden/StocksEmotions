  "text": "<p>Europe's top court has ruled that Tesco supermarket workers can compare the value of their work to that of colleagues in distribution centres, boosting a long-running equal pay claim. </p> <p>The European Court of Justice ruling in effect mirrors one by the UK's Supreme Court earlier this year on an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db023ca7-d9a7-4912-8f5e-ca64aeaa4bf7\">equal pay case involving another supermarket group, Asda</a>. At issue is the discrepancy in hourly pay rates between the mainly female staff who work in stores and the largely male workforce in distribution centres.</p> <p>Lawyers for Tesco store staff intend to argue that the work is of equal value and that the store workers are victims of gender discrimination. The ruling means that this argument can be advanced under European as well as UK law.</p> <p>An important factor in the European decision was that Tesco employed both sets of workers. “Tesco Stores appears to constitute, in its capacity as employer, a single source to which the pay and conditions of the workers . . . in its stores and distribution centres may be attributed and which could be responsible for any discrimination,” the ruling stated.</p> <p>Kiran Daurka, an employment law partner at Leigh Day, said the clarification “confirms that this . . . test can be relied upon by people in the UK bringing an equal value claim”.</p> <p>“This means that employers can no longer hide behind the grey areas of UK law.”</p> <p>Although the UK has left the EU, the request for guidance on the matter was made by an employment tribunal in August 2019 when it was still a member state. </p> <p>Leigh Day, which is bringing claims on behalf of more than 50,000 workers at several supermarkets, also pointed out that the UK had opted to retain laws on employment equality made when it was part of the EU.&#xa0;</p> <p>Tesco and other supermarkets have argued that jobs in stores and warehouses are fundamentally different. “These roles require different skills and demands which led to variations in pay — but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender,” the company said in a statement.</p> <p>“We reward our colleagues fairly for the jobs they do and work hard to ensure that the pay and benefits we offer are fair, competitive and sustainable,” it added. “We continue to strongly defend these claims.”</p> <p>Lawyers for the store staff now intend to move disputes involving all supermarkets to the next stage of the legal process.</p> <p>This involves determining whether the work is indeed of equal value, and if so whether there is any explanation other than gender discrimination for the difference in hourly pay rates.</p> <p>Although it is likely to be years before the arguments are finally settled, the cost to supermarkets could run into the billions if they lose. Walmart recently revealed in US regulatory filings that it had indemnified the buyers of Asda — TDR and the Issa brothers — against an undisclosed portion of any financial settlement arising from the equal pay claims.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'ECJ rules in favour of Tesco store staff in equal pay claim ' FT.com 3 June.
