  "title": "Biden  Shelves  Forced  Sale of  TikTok  ---  New administration  puts off court move to  ban app as it reviews  Trump security order  ----  By John D. McKinnon and Alex Leary",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- A U.S. plan to force the sale of TikTok's American operations to a group including Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. has been shelved indefinitely, people familiar with the situation said, as President Biden undertakes a broad review of his predecessor's efforts to address potential security risks from Chinese tech companies. </p><p>   The TikTok deal -- which had been driven by then-President Donald Trump -- has languished since last fall in the midst of successful legal challenges to the U.S. government's effort by TikTok's owner, China's ByteDance Ltd. </p><p>   In a new development Wednesday, the Biden administration asked to delay the government's appeal of a federal district court judge's December injunction against the TikTok ban. </p><p>   In a court filing, the Biden administration said it has begun a review of the agency action that will help it determine whether the national security threat cited by the Trump administration continues to warrant the ban. The filing by the Justice Department said the request for a delay is unopposed by TikTok and ByteDance. </p><p>   The requests for a court delay comes as discussions continue between representatives of ByteDance and U.S. national security officials, the people familiar with the talks said. Those discussions have centered on data security and ways to prevent the information TikTok collects on U.S. users from being accessed by the Chinese government, they said. </p><p>   But no imminent decision on how to resolve the issues surrounding TikTok is expected as the administration determines its own response to the potential security risk posed by Chinese tech companies' data collection. </p><p>   \"We plan to develop a comprehensive approach to securing U.S. data that addresses the full range of threats we face,\" National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said. \"This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the U.S. In the coming months, we expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive understanding of the risks we face.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump, a Republican, ordered a ban last year on TikTok aimed at forcing a sale of the popular video-sharing app to a majority-U.S.-ownership group. </p><p>   A few days later, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. -- which monitors security risks in cross-border business deals -- formally ordered ByteDance to divest itself of U.S. operations. </p><p>   TikTok asked a federal appeals court in Washington in November to vacate the divestiture order, calling it arbitrary and capricious. TikTok said it was prepared to discuss other ways to address the government's security concerns. </p><p>   While that case is pending, separate federal court rulings have blocked the government from shutting TikTok down. The most recent ruling on Dec. 7 said Mr. Trump's executive order likely overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. </p><p>   Talks between the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. and TikTok to resolve the situation have continued, according to the people familiar with the matter, one of whom said possible solutions include use of a third party to manage TikTok's data, which wouldn't require an outright sale. </p><p>   White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined Wednesday to discuss details of the Cfius review. \"I will note, broadly speaking, that we are comprehensively evaluating the risks to U.S. data including from TikTok and will address them in a decisive and effective fashion,\" Ms. Psaki said. \"If we have news to announce we will announce it.\" </p><p>   She declined to give a timetable for completion of the broad review of China tech policy. Separately, Mr. Biden announced that the Pentagon would review national security aspects of the administration's China strategy, including studying the military's footprint in Asia. </p><p>   Any TikTok deal would likely be different from the one discussed in September, the people said, in part because TikTok no longer faces the threat of an imminent shutdown. </p><p>   Any sale would also need the approval of Chinese regulators. Beijing adopted new restrictions last year on exporting certain types of social-media algorithms that TikTok uses, further complicating deal talks. </p><p>   ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming resisted the sale of TikTok last year despite calls from his large Western investors to do so. ByteDance, which counts General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital among its backers, was valued at $180 billion in December, according to PitchBook. </p><p>   Mr. Zhang recently spoke to ByteDance's employees globally, encouraging them to keep working and to wait for the geopolitical storm to pass, according to staffers interviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   Oracle, Walmart and others could still figure in a possible deal, the people familiar with the situation said, but much depends on how Mr. Biden, a Democrat, and his administration pursue the initiatives against TikTok that were launched under Mr. Trump. </p><p>   That response could start coming into focus next week. On Feb. 18, the government's formal response to TikTok's court challenge against Mr. Trump's executive order is due. The Justice Department declined to comment on whether it would continue to defend Mr. Trump's order. </p><p>   Also next week, another executive order signed by Mr. Trump is set to go into effect that would ban U.S. transactions with eight China-related apps. </p><p>   While the Biden administration could enforce the order, it could also extend the deadline, substitute a new order or simply rescind the order outright. </p><p>   Trump administration officials had contended that Chinese tech companies pose a security threat because they can be forced to share their data on people in the U.S. with China's authoritarian government. The companies have said they would never do so. </p><p>     --- </p><p>   Georgia Wells, </p><p>           || </p><p>   Sarah Nassauer, </p><p>           || </p><p>   Raffaele Huang and Liza Lin </p><p>           || </p><p>   contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
