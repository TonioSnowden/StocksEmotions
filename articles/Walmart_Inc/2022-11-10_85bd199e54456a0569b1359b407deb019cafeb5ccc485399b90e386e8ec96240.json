  "text": "<p>Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said Thursday that Canopy Growth's third-quarter revenue of $117.9 million beat her estimate by 4%, driven \"almost entirely\" by the performance of BioSteel.</p><p>Canopy Growth sales of BioSteel jumped to C$29.2 million ($22.4 million) from C$7.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The company cited growth in its distribution channel including 1,400 Walmart Inc. WMT stores.</p><p>By contrast, the cannabis business remains difficult in Canada due to price wars and oversupply as well as economic headwinds.</p><p>While Canopy Growth's medical sales rose 6% from the prior quarter, adult-use sales in Canada dropped 5% from the previous quarter.</p><p>\"While we're encouraged by the cost savings work that is underway at WEED, we believe that the global cannabis segment will likely have a negative margin for the remainder of the year,\" Azer said.</p><p>Given that spirits maker Constellation Brands STZ holds a controlling stake in Canopy Growth, it's not a big surprise that it's pushing into the drinks market. The beverage market also gives Canopy Growth a way to tap the U.S. market without violating federal laws against importing cannabis.</p><p>In another major move into drinks, Tilray Brands Inc. TLRY said Monday it paid an undisclosed sum for Montauk Brewing Co., which it described as the No. 1 craft brewer in the metro New York City market.</p><p>Tilray already owns Sweetwater, a craft beer ranked as the 10th-largest craft brewer in the U.S.</p><p>\"Upon federal legalization in the U.S., Tilray plans to take full advantage of its strategic infrastructure, operations and consumer loyal brands across beer, spirits, and snack-food categories to parlay into THC-based products and further expand its commercial opportunities,\" Tilray said recently.</p><p>At last check, Tilray offers Sweetwater products in 42 states as well as a tap room in Fort Collins, Colo., and at Denver Airport.</p><p>All told, Tilray's beverage unit generated $20.7 million in revenue in its first quarter ended August 30, up 34%. from $15.5 million in the year.</p><p>Bill Peters contributed to this report.</p><p>Canopy Growth, Tilray eye growth from non-cannabis drinks</p>",
