  "title": "Amazon's Carbon Emissions Rose in 2021 Fueled by Pandemic Shopping; The company only fractionally reduced its carbon intensity last year but was able to reach 85% of its renewable-energy goals",
  "text": "<p>Amazon grew rapidly during the height of the pandemic as consumers shopped more online and sought quicker delivery of their orders. Net sales surged nearly 22% in 2021 to $469.8 billion, contributing to a slower decline in carbon intensity, a measure of emissions per dollar of sales. Amazon lowered that score to a 1.9% decline in 2021 compared with a 16% decline in 2020.</p><p>Amazon has said it intends to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. It is also paying for projects such as restoring rainforest in Brazil.</p><p>\"The hardest thing for any company to do is to take [this] commitment and operationalize it,\" said Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability at Amazon.</p><p>Amazon also doubled the size of its fulfillment network and installed more data centers to power its cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services, between 2020 and 2021.</p><p>The tech company said it is buying more low-carbon electricity to power its buildings and cloud-computing infrastructure. Amazon said it had rooftop solar on 115 of its 1,633 global fulfillment facilities in 2021, including some throughout the U.S., Europe and India, powering up to 80% of energy use at those sites.</p><p>However, delivering a rising volume of packages—especially using ships and planes—weighed on its efforts to lower emissions tied to the delivery business. It delivered more than 100 million packages using zero-emission vehicles to doorsteps in North America and Europe in 2021, Amazon said, up from 20 million in 2020. In Paris, Amazon delivered two-thirds of shipments via zero-emission vehicles such as e-cargo bikes, electric vehicles or on foot.</p><p>But that is a small chunk of the billions of packages Amazon ships each year. The company is adding thousands of electric vehicles to its fleet, including 100,000 it ordered from Rivian Automotive Inc. to hit roads by 2030.</p><p>Satish Jindel, founder of consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc., said he estimates Amazon had around 61,000 vans delivering packages for the company in 2021 across the U.S., based on the number of drivers.</p><p>The company faces challenges in long-haul transit, including fewer options for low-carbon aviation fuel for its jets carrying cargo.</p><p>Amazon, the world's biggest corporate buyer of renewable power, reached 85% renewable energy in 2021, up from 65% in the previous year, the company said in the report. It continues to build out its renewable power as it gets closer to its target of matching 100% of its energy consumption with renewables by 2025.</p><p>The company said it shipped more than 370 million products labeled Climate Pledge Friendly—products made by Amazon and other companies that meet third-party sustainability certifications or Amazon's own certification Compact by Design. The selection of such products in the U.S. has more than doubled since June 2021.</p><p>On its e-commerce platform, Amazon reports emissions arising from the use of its own-branded goods and not those of the hundreds of thousands of other products sold on the site. These so-called scope 3 emissions encompass everything from the use of detergent to wash clothes to disposal of product packaging.</p><p>In this, the tech company uses another reporting standard under which reporting on scope 3 or indirect emissions is optional. Rivals such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. include scope 3 emissions from the use of all the products they sell in their disclosures.</p><p>Ms. Hurst said Amazon reports emissions from activities under its control \"to the greatest extent possible.\"</p><p>\"There's still good and healthy debate about this and we are constantly evolving the way we look at this,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon's Carbon Emissions Rose in 2021 Fueled by Pandemic Shopping</p>",
