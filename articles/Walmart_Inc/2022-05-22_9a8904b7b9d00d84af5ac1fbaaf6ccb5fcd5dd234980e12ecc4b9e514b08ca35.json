  "title": "A Former CEO Comes to Terms with His Bipolar Disorder; Andy Dunn, co-founder of menswear brand Bonobos, talks about going public with his 'ghost,' and destigmatizing mental illness in the workplace",
  "text": "<p>In early 2016, Bonobos co-founder and CEO Andy Dunn was looking to sell the e-commerce menswear company when he went into a manic spiral.</p><p>Before the episode was over, he had howled at the moon in his apartment and slammed his head into a door frame. He struck his then-girlfriend and kicked her mother as they tried to calm him, he writes in his new book, \"Burn Rate: Launching a Startup and Losing My Mind.\" Next came a weeklong stay in New York's Bellevue Hospital and a 12-hour jail stint after being charged with felony and misdemeanor assault. (The charges were later dismissed.)</p><p>Until then, Mr. Dunn had hidden the bipolar disorder he had struggled with since college. But after the violent episode, he revealed all to his board and colleagues. He kept his job, and a year later, sold Bonobos for $310 million to Walmart Inc. He left Walmart in 2020.</p><p>In \"Burn Rate,\" out this month, he recounts his struggles with his \"ghost\"—the name he gave his bipolar disorder—and explores the intersection of entrepreneurship and mental illness. He spoke with The Wall Street Journal's Ellie Austin at The Future of Everything Festival last week. Here are edited excerpts:</p><p>WSJ: At what point did you decide you wanted to write about your \"ghost\"?</p><p>Mr. Dunn: 2016 was a hard year. It was, 'How am I going to get healthy? Is my girlfriend going to leave me? Am I going to lose my job?' I was in and out of court, and it was six months of pretty catatonic depression, as so often follows the high high.</p><p>She stayed with me, and eventually I got on the medication mixture that enabled me to come back to life. Then, the next year: 10-year anniversary of the company, sold it, got married. It was this magical year, and it was such airbrushed, photoshopped B.S. compared to what actually happened.</p><p>It's so typical of our society, that we're all experiencing challenges—diagnosable or not—and yet we present this certain front. So after three years at Walmart, I was thinking, 'What do I do next?' I felt like telling this story with a mission of normalizing disclosure of mental illness, particularly in the workplace, was the right next thing to do.</p><p>WSJ: Do you think you would have been able to tell this story had you been earlier in your career?</p><p>Mr. Dunn: Sadly, the answer is 'No.' I was so anxious for so long that disclosing this would be a career-limiting move. For Bonobos, we raised over $100 million of capital: Would we have been able to raise that money if I'd been on the record as having Bipolar 1? Would people have wanted to work for me?</p><p>The assumption was always that it would be catastrophic professionally. We've come a long way in entertainment with this. We've done a bit of work in sports, with Simone Biles, Naomi Osaka, Mardy Fish. The workplace is the next frontier.</p><p>WSJ: You say in the book that one of the reasons maybe we don't discuss mental health in the business community is because it's so built around 'stability.' Is there any real chance of something like the startup world taking mental health seriously?</p><p>Mr. Dunn: One in five entrepreneurs is dealing with a mood disorder, to say nothing of addiction, substance abuse, narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality. We're already here facing these issues.</p><p>When I disclosed to my colleagues that I had this, it wasn't like, 'Oh, my God.' They were like, 'Uh-huh. Yeah.' They knew, even if they didn't know how profound the extremes were.</p><p>I never felt so connected to my team as when I started to disclose this. You actually inspire more followship and become a more nuanced, textured, authentic leader if you're willing to go there.</p><p>WSJ: Did you feel at any point penalized that you have bipolar disorder?</p><p>Mr. Dunn: I had a scary moment. It was time for Walmart to do background checks on me and everyone in the executive team, and I said, 'Look, you may find this record of an arrest. Here's what the issue is: I have been living for 16 years with Bipolar 1, I was in denial of it, I was unmedicated and untreated. Then I had this second manic episode last year, and I was violent when I was manic.'</p><p>The woman who was an HR business partner at Walmart said, 'You know, Andy, it happens. All of us face challenges. Let me talk to [Walmart CEO] Doug McMillon and the team.' I had two weeks of wondering, 'Oh, my God. What's going to happen here?' Then they came back and said, 'We've reviewed it, our outside doctor said you've got a clean bill of health, you're in therapy, you're doing a great job. Everyone's excited to just move forward.'</p><p>It was so healing to hear that professionally. As leaders, we need to find a way to make it safe for people to bring their full selves to work, because it is so redemptive for the person sharing it. I actually didn't need to be afraid the whole time.</p><p>A Former CEO Comes to Terms with His Bipolar Disorder</p>",
