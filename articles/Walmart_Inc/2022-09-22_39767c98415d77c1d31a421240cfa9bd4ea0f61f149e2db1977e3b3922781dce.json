  "text": "<p>Walmart Inc. on Wednesday said it planned to hire around 40,000 mostly seasonal workers for the holiday shopping period. Last year, Walmart said it was looking for around 150,000 permanent employees to work over the holidays and beyond.</p><p>Target's hiring plans come as it and other U.S. retailers are contending with changes in buying behavior. Demand, which boomed for much of the Covid-19 pandemic, has weakened as inflation has pushed consumers to limit their spending.</p><p>The Minneapolis-based company in the latest quarter reported that a glut of inventory sank profit further than it expected, reflecting the change in consumer spending. The company's response is in the hands of Chief Executive Brian Cornell, who agreed to stay in his role for an additional three years earlier this month.</p><p>Write to Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com</p><p>Target to Hire Up to 100,000 Workers for Holiday Shopping Season</p>",
