  "title": "Drugstores  Block  Startups'  Adderall  Orders  ----  By Rolfe Winkler and Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   Some of the nation's largest pharmacies have blocked or delayed prescriptions over the last year from clinicians working for telehealth startups that have sprung up to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to pharmacies and people familiar with the issue. </p><p>   The pharmacies in certain cases have expressed concerns that clinicians at Done Health and Cerebral Inc. are writing too many prescriptions for Adderall and other stimulants, the people said. The federal government considers the drugs controlled substances because of their potential for abuse and places them in the same category as cocaine. </p><p>   Many pharmacies have procedures for reviewing prescriptions of controlled substances after concerns that the ease of acquiring highly addictive pain medications contributed to the country's opioid crisis. Pharmacies might have various reasons for not completing a prescription, including that a medicine is out of stock or was prescribed before a previous prescription ran out. </p><p>   Among those questioning prescriptions from Done is Walmart Inc., which has blocked some of Done's clinicians to prevent pharmacists in its stores from filling prescriptions, Walmart confirmed. </p><p>   Individual locations of CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. have also blocked or delayed prescriptions from Done providers, as have some pharmacies attached to grocery store chains and others, according to people familiar with the actions. CVS has interviewed at least two Done doctors over prescription concerns, the doctors said in interviews. The pharmacy startup Capsule Inc. has also blocked prescriptions for a Done provider in recent weeks, according to the provider. </p><p>   Done declined to comment. Spokesmen for Walgreens and Capsule outlined the company's prescribing practices but wouldn't discuss the decision to block prescriptions. A CVS spokesman said its controlled-substance compliance group interviews clinicians it flags for potentially excessive prescribing practices. </p><p>   Online mental-health companies Done and Cerebral have grown quickly since they were founded in 2019 and serve tens of thousands of patients between them. Both companies charge patients monthly subscription fees to manage their prescriptions, rates that are higher than what they pay nurse practitioners to manage the patients. They reinvest profits in advertising on Instagram, TikTok, and Google to attract new patients. </p><p>   Some Cerebral clinicians have similarly had their prescriptions blocked or delayed for Adderall and other controlled substances, including benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, due to pharmacists' concerns about the prescriptions, according to people familiar with the company's operations. </p><p>   \"There have been incidents where prescriptions have been temporarily delayed by pharmacies due to confusion around today's telehealth policies,\" Cerebral said. \"This is an industrywide issue that we've seen and experienced with pharmacies across the country.\" </p><p>   Cerebral didn't respond when asked which other companies it believes are experiencing similar problems. </p><p>   Four of the largest general telemedicine companies -- Teladoc Health Inc., American Well Corp., MDLive and Included Health -- as well as four of the largest online mental-health companies -- Lyra Health Inc., Ginger, Spring Health and Modern Health -- don't prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine, the companies said. </p><p>   Pharmacists more frequently delay Cerebral prescriptions for administrative reasons such as when the medication is out of stock or not covered by a patient's insurance, said people familiar with the issue at the company. Cerebral has a team of clinical administrators to work with pharmacies to resolve delays. </p><p>   Some nurse practitioners at both Cerebral and Done have felt pressured to prescribe stimulants like Adderall, even though they feel the companies' 30-minute evaluations aren't long enough to properly diagnose ADHD, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. The companies said they encourage clinicians to follow evidence-based best practices. </p><p></p>",
