  "title": "Amazon Quotas Get Tested --- California Legislature approves bill to address complaints on employees' work pace",
  "text": "<p>The bill would be the first to require more transparency about a central facet of working for the tech giant, which has become the nation's second-largest private employer. Amazon warehouse workers often refer to the sorting requirements as \"making rate.\" The company has long made performance quotas central to its operations, although it has said the rate employees must meet varies based on the job and experience level.</p><p>The California Legislature, which is dominated by Democrats, approved the bill last week. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who faces a recall election Tuesday, hasn't indicated whether he would sign the bill. The Democrat has until Oct. 10 to decide. If he is removed from office in the recall, his successor likely wouldn't take office until after the deadline. Amazon, which hasn't taken its own position on the bill, declined to comment.</p><p>While it could affect numerous companies, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the bill's Democratic author, has made Amazon the central focus in public statements about the legislation. Amazon trails only Walmart Inc. as the largest private employer in the U.S., with the majority of its 950,000 U.S. employees being warehouse staff. As with many California laws, the bill could set a national standard given the state's size and political influence.</p><p>\"Increasingly, employers look to what Amazon does when implementing technology at their own facilities,\" said Ellen Reese, chair of labor studies at the University of California, Riverside and the lead author of a 2019 research paper that examined experiences of Amazon warehouse employees in the state. \"The pressure to make rates is very stressful, and for many warehouse workers, they have to cut corners in safety to make rates.\"</p><p>Amazon's quotas play a significant role in the company's intricate logistics apparatus, which includes complex algorithms that measure productivity and keep the company's supply chain humming, along with machinery and robots that speed up Amazon's processes.</p><p>It isn't clear to what extent the bill would harm Amazon, but the company could be forced to hire additional workers to keep its quick shipping times intact if it were forced to lower quotas. Greater investment into its workforce could pay off for the company long-term, Ms. Reese said, since Amazon has struggled with high turnover among its warehouse staff.</p><p>Amazon doesn't disclose its quotas but has said rate expectations are measured over time and are based on employees' experience levels, and that it accounts for health and safety when forming performance goals. A typical shift at an Amazon fulfillment center can be 10 hours, with an hour break in total. An employee is likely to handle thousands of items throughout their shift.</p><p>Amazon has recorded higher injury rates than the national average, according to company and federal workplace data. The company has taken several steps to combat injuries, including launching a safety and well-being education program for its employees and announcing a $12 million contribution to the National Safety Council to solve workplace injuries. It also eased a policy known as \"time off task\" that in part measures worker productivity.</p><p>Performance goals have been a source of tension inside Amazon warehouses. In interviews, some employees have said managers obsess over meeting quotas and have complained that Amazon's model relies too heavily on algorithmic-based performance measures that can easily lead to being terminated. Amazon has said less than 1% of firings happen due to underperformance.</p><p>Quotas and break times were among reasons some employees sought to organize in a widely covered union election at a warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., earlier this year. Although Amazon overwhelmingly won, the election is likely headed to a rerun after a federal labor official found Amazon violated labor practices during the vote, a charge Amazon has denied.</p><p>While labor organizations have cheered the bill, the measure has been opposed by business groups that include the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Retailers Association. Amazon is a member of both groups.</p><p>Rachel Michelin, head of the California Retailers Association, said the bill would increase the cost of living and damage a fragile supply chain already strained by the Covid-19 pandemic. \"Everything we buy and use moves through the manufacturing, storage and distribution process -- we will all pay the price,\" she said.</p><p>---</p><p>Christine Mai-Duc contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
