  "title": "Kroger to Buy Albertsons in a $24.6 Billion Deal; A deal giving companies greater scale as they compete against bigger retailers like Walmart; it would likely face regulatory scrutiny",
  "text": "<p>The companies said Kroger will acquire Albertsons for $34.10 a share and assume about $4.7 billion of Albertsons' net debt. They said the cash component of the deal could be reduced by the per-share value, subject to the outcome of a store divestiture process.</p><p>As part of the transaction, Albertsons will pay a special cash dividend of up to $4 billion to its shareholders.</p><p>The deal—one of the biggest in the $812 billion industry—could face a long road ahead, as antitrust enforcers have challenged some mergers under the Biden administration. Kroger and Albertsons expect to sell overlapping stores as part of the deal to help win regulatory approval, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The two companies both operate stores in Southern California, Washington, Texas and Washington, D.C., among other places.</p><p>Together, Kroger and Albertsons could command about 13% of the food-retail sales in the U.S. following divestitures for regulatory approval, according to J.P. Morgan analysts, smaller than Walmart's 22%.</p><p>The companies said Kroger plans to invest in lowering prices and expects to direct about $500 million in anticipated cost savings to reduce prices for customers. About $1.3 billion will be invested into Albertsons stores.</p><p>Kroger Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen, who will serve as chairman and CEO of the combined company, said that Albertsons brings a complementary footprint, with stores in parts of the country where Kroger has none, and that the deal will lead to faster and more profitable growth. By merging, they will also be able to further grow technology and innovation, he said, adding that the deal will generate greater returns for shareholders. The merger secures union jobs, he said.</p><p>\"We are bringing together two purpose-driven organizations to deliver superior value to customers, associates, communities and shareholders,\" said Mr. McMullen. Vivek Sankaran, CEO of Albertsons, said the companies share similar cultures and that the deal will increase value for shoppers, and access to food.</p><p>Combined, the companies said they would have a bigger network of stores, distributors and suppliers, in addition to a national reach and greater manufacturing footprint. The companies said they would also be able to deliver fresh products from fields to homes by combining their supply chains, and they will offer about 34,000 private-label products.</p><p>Kroger, based in Cincinnati, operates more than 2,700 grocery stores, including its namesake locations as well as regional chains like Fred Meyer and Ralph's, and it generated $137.9 billion in sales in its 2021 fiscal year. Albertsons runs nearly 2,300 supermarkets across the U.S., including the Safeway and Vons chains, and reported $71.9 billion in sales for fiscal 2021.</p><p>Kroger's stock had risen 2% from Dec. 31, 2021 through Wednesday's, before the deal discussions were reported Thursday. Albertsons' shares were down about 15% during the same period, compared with a 25% decline in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analysts estimated Thursday that the two companies might have to divest themselves of roughly 350 to 450 stores, or 7% to 10% of their footprint, to appeal to regulators. Creating a strong No. 2 behind Walmart could give the combined entity more leverage in negotiations with vendors and help it push back on price increases, they wrote, though they expect regulators to focus more on the enlarged company's regional influence, versus its national share.</p><p>For Kroger and Albertsons stores that may need to be sold, there aren't clear buyers, given that many of those stores are unionized, industry analysts said.</p><p>Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said in February that it was reviewing strategic options, including potential transactions, to boost value for its shareholders and expand its business, less than two years after the company went public. Albertsons has worked to improve its operations and has benefited from increased at-home food consumption during the pandemic, but its shares have largely stayed flat over the past year.</p><p>Grocers generally have performed well in recent years, benefiting as consumers directed more of their food purchasing toward supermarkets during the pandemic. Companies over the past year have raised prices in response to what executives have said are rapidly increasing costs, and consumers are still spending on essentials even as they are pulling back on spending elsewhere. Kroger and Albertsons have said consumers are trading down as prices rise, buying lower-cost store brands or items on sale.</p><p>Write to Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com</p><p>Kroger to Buy Albertsons in a $24.6 Billion Deal</p>",
