  "title": "‘Longer wait times and unstocked shelves': Nearly 1 million job openings loom over this holiday shopping season",
  "text": "<p>But for retailers who rely heavily on holiday sales, the clock is ticking extra fast.</p><p>More than 943,000 U.S.-based companies have announced plans to hire seasonal workers this year, according to data from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. That's up 11% from last year and is a record number of seasonal job announcements since the firm began tracking it in 2012.</p><p>But workers are hardly jumping at these opportunities.</p><p>Retail seasonal hiring was down 9% last month compared to last October, and seasonal transportation and warehouse hiring was down 17% for the same period, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas' analysis of non-seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>“Clearly, companies are gearing up for high demand this holiday season, but the worker shortage will complicate matters,” said &#xa0;Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p><p>Walmart WMT has said it plans to hire 150,000 workers this holiday season; Amazon AMZN plans to hire 125,000; Target TGT and UPS UPS have each announced plans to hire 100,000, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p><p>Some shoppers appear extra eager to hit stores this holiday season. One recent survey by MassMutual found that Americans are optimistic about their finances and plan to spend more than $1,200 on average on holiday-related purchases, and the National Retail Federation forecasts a record high holiday shopping season.</p><p>Meeting that demand could prove difficult. Retailers are contending with supply-chain disruptions — a side effect of global labor shortages and factory shutdowns.</p><p>“Even if there weren't issues in the general supply chain this holiday season, the worker supply shortage too will mean longer wait times and unstocked shelves,” Challenger said.</p><p>Consumers encountered more than 2 billion out-of-stock messages while they shopped online last month, according to Adobe Analytics ADBE data that analyzed over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites. That's a 325% increase from October 2019, according to the report.</p><p>Last month, retail sales jumped by 1.7% from September, but as much as half of the increase in retail sales last month was tied to higher prices, with inflation at a 31-year high.</p>",
