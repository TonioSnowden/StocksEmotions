As well Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine have accused government forces of opening fire on them.</p><p>“The market reacted this week as if something significant in the direction of de-escalation has happened, but that doesn't seem to be the case, and yet the market has only partially priced back in a higher level of concern,” said the Saxo Bank strategy team, in a note to clients.</p><p>“This geopolitical issue can remain the source of significant market volatility on fresh developments/headlines, especially ahead of the weekend if tensions are escalating again today or tomorrow,” said the Saxo team.</p><p>The uncertainty sent gold prices higher by 0.9% to $1,887.70 an ounce, with the U.S. dollar DXY modestly higher.
