  "text": "<p>Walmart+ subscribers in some markets can use the company's app to schedule a pickup for their return items, which don't have to be boxed or labeled, the company said. Walmart+ is a membership program similar to Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime, offering subscribers free shipping, free grocery delivery and other benefits.</p><p>Walmart, the country's largest private employer, said it was offering free home-return pickup and other benefits, including curbside return service, to save customers time during the holiday shopping season.</p><p>A company spokeswoman declined to disclose how many households would be able to use the new return option. She said Walmart hoped to offer the service to its members year-round and expand how many areas the option would be available in.</p><p>Other companies, including Amazon, which revolutionized internet shopping in part by offering streamlined returns, don't offer a free home pickup option. An Amazon spokeswoman said customers in some areas can pay for their returns to be picked up.</p><p>Walmart's pickup drivers will be independent contractors hired through the company's crowdsourced delivery-driver network, Spark Driver, the Walmart spokeswoman said.</p><p>Walmart launched its membership program, Walmart+, in 2020 in an effort to build a program that could rival Amazon Prime, which ended 2021 with 172 million members in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a market research company. The Walmart spokeswoman declined to say how many subscribers Walmart+ had.</p><p>Walmart+ is at least the company's second attempt to launch a subscription program that could take on Amazon. In 2017, the company scrapped an earlier version of the program called ShippingPass, which for nearly two years offered free two-day shipping for a $49 yearly fee.</p><p>Amazon Prime costs $139 a year while Walmart+ subscribers pay $98 annually.</p><p>Walmart in 2020 launched a program in which FedEx drivers could pick up a customer's labeled items at home.</p><p>Online retailers have struggled in recent years to handle more returns, which surged as more customers shopped online during the pandemic. Some retailers have introduced virtual dressing rooms and other tactics to encourage customers to keep their purchases.</p><p>â€”Sarah Nassauer contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart to Offer Free Return Pickups at Home for Some Members</p>",
