  "text": "<p>The first is the consumer. Fear had begun to grow since mid-May that a consumer-led recession was on the way as inflation crushed spending power. Bad results from Walmart and Target hammered their shares and worry spread across the stock market, with the median retailer in the S&amp;P 1500 index dropping 14% in the week up to May 24th.</p><p>One sign of how deep the economic concern was: Stocks and Treasury yields began moving in the same direction again. The S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year yield rose and fell together for nine out of 10 days up to May 24th, the most this year, as the focus moved to economic news (a weaker economy lowers yields and hits the S&amp;P) instead of inflation (higher inflation means higher yields, which are generally bad for stocks).</p><p>But other retailers have since come through with better results, and shares of those that beat expectations soared, with Macy's up almost 20% in a day. Overall, the median retailer -- I use the median because otherwise Amazon's market value dwarfs everyone else's -- gained 14% since Tuesday last week. The economic data backed this up, with personal-consumption expenditure in April coming in ahead of forecasts, although lower than March.</p><p>Simply put, consumer spending is probably slowing, but not as much as investors feared. The selloff was overdone -- but uncertainty remains.</p><p>This feeds into the second explanation, investor sentiment. The mood in markets was sour, worse on many surveys than at the low in 2020. When we think things are bad, it is easier for the same news to be interpreted as a bit better, and that is exactly what happened. It is always possible for sentiment to get even worse (it is nowhere near as bad as at the 2009 low), but the odds of things looking up improve.</p><p>Unfortunately, sentiment swings are typically temporary and need support from fundamentals, economic improvement or monetary policy shifts to last.</p><p>The third point is monetary policy, where there was a little shift. Investors think the slowing economy and signs that inflation might, perhaps, please please please, have peaked, mean fewer rate increases will be needed than before. There were even a couple of dovish-sounding suggestions from Federal Reserve officials about pausing and eventually cutting rates after a speedy set of rises this spring and summer.</p><p>Expectations for lower rates because of a weak economy aren't beneficial enough to offset the damage to stocks done by the threat to profits. But expectations for lower rates because the Fed is changing how it responds are great for stocks, because they mean easier money without any threat to the economy. This helped stocks in general do well, while those most sensitive to bond yields, high-growth low-profit stocks, did better still. ARK Innovation, a fund of mostly loss-making growth stocks, is up 16% since Tuesday.</p><p>Can all this last?</p><p>The consumer shift is really just the evaporation of bad news, not actual good news. Consumers are digging into their ample savings, which helps but can't go on forever.</p><p>At some point pay has to rise enough to sustain spending, without generating yet more inflation. Sentiment has plenty further to go, which could help the rally for a bit but on its own is no basis for a longer-term recovery.</p><p>There is perhaps a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to the Fed, but words are cheap, and it will be a long time before we see whether the Fed is truly prepared to brighten up the stock market.</p>",
