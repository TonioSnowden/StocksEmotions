  "title": "How Inventory Trackers Can Help You Find Baby Formula; Finding baby formula amid the nationwide shortage takes patience and luck. These websites alert you to the availability of Similac, Enfamil and other brands at major online retailers.",
  "text": "<p>After Abbott Laboratories recalled several powdered formulasin February, leading to nationwide shortages, parents began submitting requests to stock-monitoring platforms including NowInStock.net, ZooLert.com and HotStock.io. The websites, which also helped people find Covid-19 test kits amid scarcity, run software that recurrently checks inventory at major online retailers. (You can learn more about how this works in my video.)</p><p>\"At first, only a few infant formulas were hard to find,\" said Tony Nguyen, creator of ZooLert. \"Now almost every one of them sells out quickly.\" The website searches for inventory updates on the most popular products every 45 seconds. </p><p>ZooLert updates its tracker for baby formula every 45 seconds.

They also include links to items available for preorder and show the last time they were in stock.</p><p>Within seconds of product becoming available, the tracking websites can update and send alerts to users who sign up and opt in. On Monday, ZooLert indicated a 24-pack of Abbott's Similac Total Care was available at Walmart. The ready-to-feed formula showed as sold out about a minute later. NowInStock showed a 12.6-ounce canister of Enfamil available at Target. It sold out the same day.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you have tips of your own for finding baby formula or any other scarce items online?</p><p>The Biden administration launched its own website Friday to point families toward local food banks and government-aid services that can help provide formula. The administration also said it is working with companies to get more formula on shelves more quickly, including flying in formula from overseas.</p><p>Meanwhile, trackers may help you find the scarce supplies locally. If you decide to use the trackers, getting an email or text about product availability is just the start. You'll still need to respond to the alert fast. And don't wait until you're completely out of formula to use the trackers—alerts aren't guaranteed, and not all retailers will deliver to your home at the same speed.</p><p>Here's how to use an inventory tracker to find baby formula: </p><p>HotStock will send users smartphone notifications when a product becomes available. PHOTO: Dalvin Brown/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Register for an account. To receive alerts from NowInStock, ZooLert and HotStock, you'll need to sign up and tell the service which product you're interested in. If you don't register, you'll have to leave a tracker's webpage open on your browser and keep checking back for any changes. (Some services offer paid subscription features such as faster notifications.)</p><p>Create accounts with baby-formula retailers. The checkout process will go faster if the retailer already has your address and payment information stored. You can also use your browser's autofill feature to quickly input your name and shipping information.</p><p>Choose your notification type. ZooLert and NowInStock can send you an email or browser alert. (After you sign up, add the company's email to your address book so messages won't end up in spam.) The HotStock app can send push notifications to your phone.</p><p>Turn on your notifications. Make sure your smartphone or computer isn't in Do Not Disturb mode. Turn up the volume so you can hear an alert. Also, make sure you don't have your phone's low-power battery-saver mode turned on because it can slow down notifications.</p><p>Be patient. The tech isn't failproof. You might not get formula the first (or second) time you try—either because other people moved faster, or because a bug sent a false alert. But they may save you time since you won't have to keep refreshing each retailer's website, just hoping that your formula shows up as available.</p><p>—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter .</p><p>Write to Dalvin Brown at dalvin.brown@wsj.com</p><p>How Inventory Trackers Can Help You Find Baby Formula</p>",
