  "title": "Alcohol Delivery Company Drizly Debuts Ad Platform, Hires New Marketing Chief; Uber-owned firm brings on former PepsiCo exec to capitalize on online alcohol sales growth",
  "text": "<p>Under the new banner of Drizly Ads, it will now promote a broader suite of self-service and custom products for marketers, including search and display ads, premium brand pages, sponsored product listings, events and brand takeovers of its website and app, said Amit Patel, senior vice president of strategic partnerships and monetization.</p><p>So-called retail media networks like Drizly Ads have grown rapidly during the pandemic, as companies like Walmart Inc., Marriott International Inc. and Lyft Inc. rolled out or expanded their own offerings to make the most of the shift toward online sales.</p><p>Retail media as a whole went from generating $88 billion in advertising revenue last year to $101 billion this year, accounting for 11% of total ad sales and 18% of digital ad sales on a global basis, according to GroupM, the media division of ad holding company WPP PLC.</p><p>Alcohol's status as one of the most heavily-regulated consumer goods categories limits distributors' ability to market their products relative to most other categories. Emma de Szoeke, senior vice president of consumer insights, analytics and business growth at the wines and spirits division of LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.E., said in a statement that Drizly is one of the few places where her company can run multimedia ad campaigns.</p><p>Alcohol brands traditionally spent the majority of their paid media budgets on brand awareness efforts due, in part, to those regulations, but during the pandemic they began turning to highly-targeted campaigns that can more accurately measure engagement rates and other key metrics, Mr. Patel said.</p><p>\"The pandemic emphasized the importance of e-commerce, and they are moving brand dollars to performance media,\" he said.</p><p>Drizly has collaborated with most of the top 50 alcohol suppliers and plans to increasingly pitch midsize and emerging brands that are interested in reaching its core demographic of millennial and Gen Z drinkers but work with limited budgets, Mr. Patel said.</p><p>Drizly, which operates in 35 states and works with nearly 5,000 retailers, said advertisers on its network can benefit from the first-party data drawn from its app, website and newsletter subscriber list. The database allows the company to charge above-market rates for ad placements, according to Mr. Patel.</p><p>Drizly is expanding and restructuring its ad sales team to develop deeper relationships with alcohol suppliers, advertising agencies, platforms and publishers and to provide marketers with more detailed reports on the performance of their campaigns, Mr. Patel said.</p><p>The company also hired Gina Hardy as its first chief customer officer to oversee all marketing operations. Ms. Hardy, who was previously chief marketing officer at smart home gym company Tonal Systems Inc. and held executive marketing roles at PepsiCo Inc., succeeds ex-CMO Scott Braun, who left early this year to join home security firm SimpliSafe.</p><p>Mr. Patel declined to comment on specific growth goals for Drizly, but said the company sees significant potential in its advertising platform, which is independent of its parent company's Uber Eats ad business.</p><p>Drizly sales grew 517% from September 2019 to September 2021, according to market-research firm Bloomberg Second Measure. Uber doesn't break out separate sales totals for Drizly.</p><p>Drizly's competitors include other alcohol delivery services like Saucey Inc. as well as larger grocery delivery companies such as Instacart Inc. and DoorDash Inc., both of which have begun selling alcohol products in some states.</p><p>Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com</p><p>Alcohol Delivery Company Drizly Debuts Ad Platform, Hires New Marketing Chief</p>",
