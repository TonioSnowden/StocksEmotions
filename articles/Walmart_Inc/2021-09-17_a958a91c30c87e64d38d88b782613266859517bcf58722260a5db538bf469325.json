Some analysts took the figures as further evidence that economic recovery was stalling as labour shortages and supply chain problems began to bite. Others pointed out that the drop was due to consumers spending less on shopping and more on going out as lockdowns were lifted.</p> <p>In stark contrast, similar data from the US yesterday showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f5d8e8a-c65f-4ce8-86c5-b152a3c0c836\">sales bouncing back strongly</a> after consumer confidence had taken a knock from fears about the resurgence of coronavirus infections and rising prices. The figures strengthen the view of those who argue the Federal Reserve should begin winding down its pandemic support measures.</p> <p>As in the UK, analysts took disappointing retail sales data from China on Wednesday as another sign of the country's recovery <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b586748e-a429-4532-94c3-402fca31747f\">losing momentum</a> and hardening the case for more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e16ce85-74fa-4333-8ada-b86b778580cf\">government stimulus</a>. Sales rose just 2.5 per cent in August, far below economists' forecasts and the slowest increase in 12 months.&#xa0;</p> <p>Global retailers have generally been more upbeat. US industry giants Walmart, Target and Home Depot all reported solid revenues earlier in the summer, while Inditex, the world's biggest clothes seller, best known for its Zara brand, this week reported a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0515e28-a08b-439a-88e7-8de65ad51ef7\">strong bounceback</a> from the pandemic. Although the company was hit hard by the forced closure of stores, a strong online performance meant quarterly figures for sales, profits and cash generation were now higher than pre-crisis levels. Rival H&amp;M also reported sales <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/160080b5-dc6b-47b0-b073-8aca600bc521#post-0e7a8879-330a-4f5b-a832-ec56fa528ad5\">back at pre-pandemic levels</a> in the US and Europe. </p> <p>In the UK, Marks and Spencer last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c0adf8e-0026-4b6d-90b1-58a8c5c97b37\">upgraded profit forecasts</a> for the first time this century, citing pent-up consumer demand as stores reopened, although it has since run into Brexit-related problems at its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/134a4c90-9413-4f4a-8e29-af68c6895c78\">stores in France</a>. A recovery in<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4d91632-b7d5-451e-b5b3-7089cdb96c32\"> half-year profits</a> at John Lewis meanwhile led the UK high street bellwether to announce yesterday it could reinstate its staff bonus after ditching it for the first time since 1953.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>UK chancellor <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> is planning to use his Budget statement on October 27 to unveil new rules to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb23375d-7219-4b22-a8a7-3060cd848163\">curb government borrowing</a>. Economics editor Chris Giles argues that the <strong>Bank of England</strong> should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5f4c04d-fc42-4680-99c7-cd6ce4ec94c6\">begin a gentle monetary tightening</a> when its policy committee meets next week. Public concerns about <strong>inflation</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5849bfe-00a8-4ea0-a6cf-70f34655d484\">rose sharply in August</a>, according to a new Bank of England survey. </p> <p>The Financial Times revealed that unpublished <strong>European Central Bank</strong> estimates showed the bank would hit its 2 per cent inflation target by 2025, suggesting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ee1336d-1c7c-43b5-a8ed-f141f31fb70e\">interest rates</a> could rise in just over two years — much earlier than expected. The forecast is likely to fuel the global debate about central banks' withdrawal of stimulus programmes and when they might begin to increase interest rates.</p> <p>US editor at large Gillian Tett bemoans the lack of debate on soaring levels of <strong>global debt</strong>. The silence is all the more shocking, she argues, given that since the financial crisis, which prompted much hand-wringing about excessive leverage, global borrowing has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be32e263-0d55-4df4-a214-855bcad2c60d\">grown by more than a third</a>.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Maersk</strong>, the world's largest container shipping line and whose performance is seen as a gauge for global trade, again <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b26816f-7cba-489d-9790-4d2cd4118069\">lifted profit forecasts</a> thanks to soaring freight rates. The Danish group expects underlying operating profits to hit $19bn, the highest in the company's history.</p> <p>Analysts warned that revenues and share prices for <strong>Pfizer</strong> and <strong>Moderna</strong>, leaders in the initial race to find a coronavirus vaccine, could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19543f26-f9f0-4075-9b71-ec86e06eaf88\">fall sharply by 2024</a> as global demand wanes and more competitors begin producing jabs. “The share prices of these vaccine companies are being driven more by momentum and headlines relating to variants, boosters, full approval, and not to fundamentals,” said one analyst.</p> <p>Watch our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3515f151-f014-443e-91df-4acddc8675b5\">new film</a> on the risky business of <strong>music festivals </strong>as we talk to organisers, bands and stage hands about how they survive in normal times and how they can outlive the pandemic.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/3515f151-f014-443e-91df-4acddc8675b5.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><strong>European equities</strong> edged higher as investors bet on Chinese authorities taking steps to boost the nation's flagging recovery and the UK looked set to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e16ce85-74fa-4333-8ada-b86b778580cf\">ease pandemic travel restrictions</a>.</p> <p>Inflation may be back but we are far from the disaster of the 1970s, says journalist and author <strong>Sebastian Mallaby</strong>, who argues it is far too soon for central bankers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d072c40e-50e0-4279-99d8-220ab4954527\">start panicking</a>. </p> <p><strong>Global investors</strong> have suddenly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03285246-065e-4cbc-b2b2-eedb3d06ccb1\">grown more cautious</a> for fear of “doing something stupid”, writes markets editor Katie Martin. But the real curiosity, she notes, “is that while optimism is plunging, markets very clearly are not”.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>John B 52</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/423a83ca-19b8-42e2-8a3d-4048f20e371d?commentID=e5479f77-e278-4db3-b1ea-a9372d23c1b1\">We are creeping towards a continuous working week</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>I'd add in (from an employer's point of view) worries about productivity. ‘Never off' so easily morphs into never completely on — few can work very long hours without a decline in output, and the internet offers numerous distractions. These are doubled up for homeworkers coping with partners, children, deliveries etc, while lacking the discipline that comes from supervised work on premises where there is the added factor of peer-group pressure. Not everyone has perfected personal time management.<br><br>Highly motivated individuals with fascinating or compelling jobs may step up, but the vast majority of workers performing humdrum, routine tasks will find that as time-spent merges into elapsed time, work actually accomplished dwindles, or is skimped.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f4bf863-2d1f-479f-affd-aba1c8aeb7af\">shared love of music</a> not only brings generations together but also offers pointers for policymakers, writes deputy opinion editor Miranda Green. To nurture social cohesion, she says, “we must find the policy equivalent of a wedding dance floor when the DJ puts on ‘Dancing Queen', with young and old from different families crashing around happily together”.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'UK retail staggers from fourth monthly drop in succession' FT.com 17 September.
