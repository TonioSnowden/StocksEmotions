  "text": "<p>Walmart booked record sales in its holiday quarter as a fresh round of stimulus cheques and a slowdown in coronavirus cases encouraged Americans to spend on gifts and household goods.</p> <p>Demand at the world's largest retailer picked up from the previous quarter. Comparable sales at Walmart's US stores rose 8.6 per cent when excluding fuel in the three months to the end of January compared with a year ago. That surpassed like-for-like sales growth of 6.4 per cent in the October quarter and analysts' forecasts of 5.6 per cent.</p> <p>Walmart said demand in the US was strong across most key product categories, contributing to a 7.3 per cent year-on-year rise in overall revenue to $152bn.</p> <p>The results also reflected consumers' shift to shopping online during the coronavirus pandemic. Walmart's online sales surged 69 per cent, well beyond the 35 per cent gain of a year earlier.</p> <p>Sam's Club, the company's members-only chain, registered a 10.8 per cent increase in comparable sales, while membership income grew at its strongest rate in six years.</p> <p>Walmart has been a retail winner over the past year, thanks in part to its broad mix of groceries, electronics, toys, home decor and other strong-selling products. Other big-box stores such as Target have also seen sales surge with consumers looking for one-stop shopping.</p> <p>US retail sales <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d28acdd8-b6ea-4a49-a9f2-30fc5895d0f7\">jumped</a> in January after a lacklustre December, boosted by fresh fiscal aid out of Washington and relaxed curbs on businesses as a resurgence of coronavirus slowed.</p> <p>Brett Biggs, Walmart's chief financial officer, said the group saw an “acceleration” in January following a strong holiday season.</p> <p>However, Walmart cautioned that net sales and earnings per share were expected to decline in the new fiscal year, mainly because of planned divestitures. Excluding those effects, it forecast sales growth in the low single digits and earnings per share to be flat to slightly higher.</p> <p>The company projected Walmart's US comparable sales to rise by low single digits versus 8.6 per cent growth last year.</p> <p>In the fourth quarter, operating income gained 3.1 per cent year on year to $5.5bn. Walmart earned $1.39 per share on an adjusted basis, up from $1.38 a year earlier but missing a consensus estimate of $1.51.</p> <p>Shares in the company dropped 4.9 per cent in pre-market trading.</p> <p>Walmart also announced that it would raise wages for 425,000 employees, bringing the average for its associates to above $15 per hour. The company increased pay for 165,000 workers in the autumn.</p><p>Source: Matthew Rocco 2021 'Walmart rakes in record holiday sales but gives cautious outlook' FT.com 18 February.
