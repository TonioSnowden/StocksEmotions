  "title": "Kroger, Albertsons Explore Merger  ----  By Cara Lombardo and Jaewon Kang",
  "text": "<p>   Kroger Co. is in discussions with smaller rival Albertsons Cos. over a potential combination that could unite the two largest supermarket operators in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Combining could give the companies greater scale as they compete against rivals such as Walmart Inc., the biggest seller of groceries in the U.S. </p><p>   A possible deal would likely face regulatory scrutiny, analysts said, at a time when food prices for consumers have soared. Under the Biden administration, antitrust enforcers have been challenging mergers, arguing that combining big companies can give the merged entities too much power and stifle competition. </p><p>   A deal could be announced as soon as this week, assuming talks don't fall apart, the people said. Albertsons shares settled 11.5% higher Thursday -- giving it a market capitalization of about $15 billion -- following a Bloomberg News report on the discussions, while Kroger shares rose 1%, giving it a $33 billion market value. </p><p>   A deal would create a grocery giant, operating thousands of stores across the U.S. and ranking as one of the country's biggest employers, with hundreds of thousands of workers. Combining operations could help cut costs in areas like purchasing, and give the enlarged company more heft when negotiating with vendors, industry advisers said. </p><p>   Kroger, based in Cincinnati, operates more than 2,700 grocery stores, including its namesake locations as well as regional chains such as Fred Meyer and Ralph's, and it generated $137.9 billion in sales in its 2021 fiscal year. Albertsons runs nearly 2,300 supermarkets across the U.S., including the Safeway and Vons chains, and reported $71.9 billion in sales for fiscal 2021. </p><p>   The two companies operate in many of the same areas, including Southern California, Washington, Colorado, Texas and Chicago. Kroger and Albertsons expect to divest overlapping stores as part of the deal to smooth the way for regulatory approval, said people familiar with the discussions. </p><p>   Wells Fargo analysts estimated Thursday that at least 25% of Albertsons' store base may need to be sold to a third party to overcome potential regulatory hurdles. It's unclear who the buyers might be for unionized grocery stores, the analysts wrote, and the price they might pay. </p><p>   The Federal Trade Commission has already been scrutinizing the sector. Late last year the agency said it was ordering big retailers and manufacturers, including Kroger, to provide information about how they are handling supply-chain challenges, as it studies whether those problems have led to anticompetitive behavior. </p><p>   Sara John, a senior policy scientist at consumer-advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that the potential merger would reduce competition in local markets and across the country. \"Of course there are price concerns,\" she said. </p><p>   Megadeals in the food sector have been blocked before the current administration, including a proposed merger between food-service distributors Sysco Corp. and US Foods Inc. that was halted in 2015. </p><p>   Business has been strong for supermarket operators in recent years. As restaurants limited service in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic and Americans hunkered down, more of consumers' spending on food was directed toward grocery stores. Supermarket chains expanded online shopping and delivery services. </p><p>   Over the past year, inflation has boosted sales for grocers that have passed along higher prices to consumers. Consumers have kept up their grocery shopping despite rising price tags, and executives have said that supermarkets stand to retain shoppers as U.S. consumers slow spending in response to escalating food and fuel costs. In supermarket aisles, that has led consumers in some cases to switch to cheaper products, including grocery chains' own store brands. </p><p>   Kroger said in September that identical sales, a metric that accounts for store openings and closings, increased 5.8% in its latest quarter, excluding fuel sales. Albertsons in July said identical sales for its most recent quarter rose by 6.8%. </p><p>   Albertsons, which went public in 2020, said in February it was reviewing strategic options including potential transactions to boost value for its shareholders and expand its business. The company has worked to improve its operations and has benefited from increased at-home food consumption during the pandemic, but its shares have largely stayed flat over the past year. </p><p>   Kroger has a long history of acquisitions, including meal-kit maker Home Chef, cheese company Murray's Cheese and the Harris Teeter grocery chain. Albertsons has also been active on the deal front, in 2017 buying meal-kit company Plated. </p><p>   Private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP invested in Albertsons in 2006, merging the company with Safeway Inc. in 2015 and unsuccessfully trying to take the combined entity public. Three years later, Albertsons tried to go public by merging with Rite Aid Corp., but the companies walked away from that deal following investor pushback. </p><p>   In 2015, Albertsons bought back 33 stores that the FTC had required the chain to sell as a condition of approving its Safeway acquisition. After Albertsons sold stores to Haggen Holdings LLC, a small Pacific Northwest chain, Haggen struggled to integrate them and filed for bankruptcy within months. </p><p></p>",
