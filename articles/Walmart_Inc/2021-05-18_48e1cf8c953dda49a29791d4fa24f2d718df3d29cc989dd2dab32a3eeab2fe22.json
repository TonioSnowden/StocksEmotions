  "text": "<p>   CVS Health Corp. and Target Corp. said vaccinated customers were no longer required to wear masks in stores, joining other U.S. retailers rethinking their policies after federal health officials relaxed their guidelines. </p><p>   CVS said customers who aren't vaccinated \"are asked to continue wearing face coverings.\" Employees must continue to wear masks. \"Health, safety and science will continue to drive our decision-making process,\" the company said. </p><p>   Target said customers and employees who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 didn't need face coverings. The company said it would obey local ordinances requiring face coverings, and that it would continue increased safety and cleaning measures, including social distancing, in its stores. </p><p>   Walmart Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. said last week they would drop mask requirements for vaccinated shoppers. </p><p>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that fully vaccinated people didn't need to wear a mask or physically distance during outdoor or indoor activities, large or small, in most settings. </p><p></p>",
