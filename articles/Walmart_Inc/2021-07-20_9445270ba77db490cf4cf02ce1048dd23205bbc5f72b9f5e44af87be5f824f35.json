  "text": "<p>Apollo has pulled out of the bidding war for Wm Morrison and is instead negotiating whether to join a Fortress-led offer for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain.</p> <p>A group of three private investment groups led by SoftBank-owned Fortress agreed a £9.5bn deal to acquire the grocer this month. Their successful bid came just two weeks after an unsolicited approach from US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. </p> <p>Apollo had said it was also looking at Morrisons, sparking the possibility of a three-way bidding war for the supermarket.</p> <p>But on Tuesday, Apollo said it was no longer considering its own offer, stating that it was in “preliminary stages of discussions with Fortress” and “may” join the investment consortium.</p> <p>“Apollo confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Morrisons other than as part of the Fortress offer,” the private equity group added.</p> <p>The Fortress-led group already includes backing from the Canadian pension fund CPPIB and a real estate-focused investing arm of American conglomerate Koch Industries. </p> <p>Its bid of 252p plus a special dividend of 2p values the equity of Morrisons at £6.3bn before the inclusion of £3.2bn of net debt.</p> <p>The Fortress-led consortium is moving quickly to close the deal, according to two people with details on the negotiations. Morrisons is aiming to release a circular to shareholders before the end of the month, after which a shareholder vote will be held in mid-August</p> <p>Those plans could be disrupted if CD&amp;R returns with a fresh offer. It has until the shareholder vote to improve its rejected bid, which valued Morrisons at £8.7bn including debt. </p> <p>Shares in Morrisons fell slightly to 261p in early Tuesday trading, but continue to trade above the Fortress-led group's bid, a sign that investors believe the bidding war will continue. </p> <p>If it decides to add Apollo to its investor group, Fortress would potentially have further firepower to fund its efforts. </p> <p>“[Apollo and Fortress] have worked together in the US and know each other well. There's a wider relationship . . . it's not to say it will happen but there are discussions,” said one person close to the talks.</p> <p>“It's not unusual to have other capital join in — with over £3bn of equity in the deal you can spread that around,” the person added, referring to the non-debt funded portion of the Fortress group's bid.</p> <p>Apollo has shown an interest in supermarkets before. In 2016, it struck a $1.36bn deal for US grocery chain Fresh Market and in recent days has filed paperwork to return the business to the US public market. It also made a failed tilt at UK supermarket group Asda last year.</p> <p>Negotiations over the future of Morrisons, which traces its roots back to a market stall opened in 1899, have drawn political attention amid a wave of private equity takeovers of UK businesses since the start of the year. </p> <p>Ministers have sought assurance over several public commitments that the Fortress-led consortium has made, including plans to keep Morrisons' headquarters in West Yorkshire, safeguard pensions and maintain a £10-an-hour minimum pay deal for staff.</p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson, Arash Massoudi and Sarah Provan 2021 'Apollo drops plans to launch rival bid for Morrisons ' FT.com 20 July.
