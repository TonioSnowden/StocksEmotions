  "title": "Business News:  Truepill  To Stop  Providing  Adderall  ----  By Rolfe Winkler",
  "text": "<p>   Online pharmacy company Truepill Inc. said it is temporarily halting prescriptions for Adderall and other controlled substances used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and partner Cerebral Inc. told its clinicians to direct those orders to patients' local pharmacies. </p><p>   Cerebral, an online mental-health company based in San Francisco that describes Truepill as its preferred pharmacy, informed its clinicians of Truepill's decision in a Friday email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The email said Truepill would no longer support mailing Schedule 2 controlled substances, including Adderall and Vyvanse, \"to any of their customers.\" </p><p>   Truepill said that, \"out of an abundance of caution,\" it is temporarily pausing all fulfillment of Schedule 2 substances while it evaluates appropriate next steps. It said Schedule 2 substances such as Adderall make up less than 1% of its total prescription volume. Truepill didn't provide a list of other partners affected by its decision. </p><p>   Some of the nation's largest pharmacies have blocked or delayed prescriptions over the past year from clinicians working for telehealth startups that have sprung up to treat ADHD, pharmacies and people familiar with the issue said. </p><p>   The Journal reported last week that pharmacies including Walmart Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. have blocked or delayed prescriptions for companies treating ADHD online or have blocked individual prescribers, people familiar with the issue said. </p><p>   Walmart confirmed it has blocked some prescribers and some prescriptions. A spokesman for Walgreens outlined the company's prescribing practices but wouldn't discuss the decision to block prescriptions. A CVS spokesman said its controlled-substance compliance group interviews clinicians it flags for potentially excessive prescribing practices. </p><p>   Truepill is going further by stopping indefinitely all prescriptions of Adderall and other Schedule 2 controlled substances. </p><p>   Cerebral said in the email to clinicians on Friday that Truepill would continue filling other prescriptions, including for Schedule 3 through 5 controlled substances that the federal government designates as having lower potential for abuse. </p><p>   The government classifies Schedule 2 substances as drugs \"with a high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence.\" Other Schedule 2 substances include OxyContin and Vicodin. </p><p>   At the same time, stimulants such as Adderall can have significant benefits for people properly diagnosed with ADHD, psychiatrists say. </p><p>   Cerebral said it is working with Truepill \"to ensure a smooth transition for impacted clients and prevent a disruption in the client's prescribed, evidence-backed course of treatment.\" It said Truepill's action affects less than 2% of its total prescriptions. </p><p>   Some nurse practitioners at Cerebral say they have felt pressured to prescribe stimulants like Adderall, and say the companies' 30-minute evaluations aren't long enough to properly diagnose ADHD, the Journal reported in March. </p><p>   \"We do not pressure our clinicians and have not disciplined, reprimanded or dismissed a clinician for not prescribing medications,\" Cerebral said. \"We have a multi-step approach to assessing our clients and provide our clinicians with the support to make the best decisions on behalf of their patients.\" </p><p></p>",
