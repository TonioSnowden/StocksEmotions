  "title": "Inside View: How the Fed Stifles Lending",
  "text": "<p>In repo, broker-dealers, hedge funds and banks construct short-term transactions. You put up collateral -- Treasury bills or sometimes less-pristine instruments -- with an agreement to buy them back the next day or week for slightly more, and invest the proceeds in the interim. Jeffrey Snider, head of research at Alhambra Investments, calls it a \"reserve-less currency system.\" This is how global supply chains are funded, to bring us cheap goods from Walmart or Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes lenders repledge the collateral to other lenders and take out repo loans of their own. And the cycle goes on. It's a little bit like hot potato, passing the collateral to the next guy. Known as rehypothecation, these transfers used to be done once or twice for each posted asset but are now sometimes done six to eight times, each time creating new money supply. Note: this is modern money creation -- outside the purview of the Federal Reserve -- and it's huge.</p><p>When times are good, repos work fine: The agreements expire without problems and the collateral gets passed back down the chain smoothly. But eventually, iffy collateral sneaks into the system. That's also fine, until markets hit an inevitable rough patch, like, say, March 2020. No one will take the junky stuff anymore, and everyone scrambles for good collateral. So there's a mad dash, a brawl really, to buy Treasurys -- like musical chairs with six to eight buyers eagerly eyeing one chair.</p><p>We saw this collateral problem in action. In March credit spreads between good and junkier debt widened and Treasury prices spiked as yields plummeted because of the buying frenzy. The interest rate on one-month Treasurys dropped from 1.61% on Feb. 18 to 0.00% on March 28. That was the scramble for good collateral.</p><p>But wait, U.S. government debt was $24 trillion in March -- why weren't there enough Treasurys around to buy? Because, you guessed it, the Fed has been gobbling them up, $80 billion a month, for quantitative easing. Mr. Snider explains, \"low interest rates were not from the Fed's buying bonds, but from stripping the market of good collateral.\" The Dow's 22-day plunge into a bear market (from Feb. 20 to March 12) wasn't from feared lockdowns, but from fear of a financial meltdown caused by lack of good collateral for the credit market to function.</p><p>But didn't the Fed come to the rescue, through its lending facilities authorized in the Cares Act? Well, not really. You can tell because the Fed hardly lent anything out. Instead, Cares funds were spent on payroll protection and bailouts and unemployment bonuses and $1,200 checks. To fund the Cares Act, the Treasury Department had to issue close to $2 trillion in new debt.</p><p>Bada-boom, that was it! Those new Treasurys were precisely the good collateral that the credit market needed! The stock market has been on a bull run ever since, though it took until later in April for the Treasury Department to raise the debt, easing the credit market. \"When the government auctioned off more T-bills,\" Mr. Snider tells me with amazement in his voice, \"by accident they provided exactly what the market absolutely needed.\"</p><p>So should Washington spend and issue Treasurys willy-nilly? I'm sure the Biden administration and the tax-and-spend House would happily oblige.</p><p>No, no, no. To resolve the instability problem, the Fed needs to end QE -- stop gobbling up Treasurys, the good collateral the global economy needs to function.</p><p>Yes, stop buying Treasurys. The Fed is depriving the rest of the system the oxygen it needs to grow. And the six to eight times Treasurys get repledged, which creates that excess money supply -- well, that money has to go somewhere, which explains the hot air pumping up Tesla, DoorDash, bitcoin, etc. Without QE hogging collateral, maybe rehypothecation is done only two or three times, meaning a much more stable credit market. Momentum investors beware.</p><p>Sadly, there are obstacles, not the least of which is that Mr. Powell wants to be renominated for Fed chairman. Ending QE would probably let interest rates return to a higher normal, which would increase the cost of running government deficits. And the bubblicious stock market might deflate. So what?</p><p>Global credit is, Mr. Snider tells me, a \"fragile system that doesn't need much of a trigger to go backward.\" The least the Fed can do is get out of the way. End QE now.</p><p>---</p><p>Write to kessler@wsj.com</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Gresham's Law, 2021 Style\" -- WSJ Jan. 20, 2021)</p>",
