  "title": "Business News: Ports Stretched For Shipping- Season Peak --- Shippers opt to start the season earlier to avoid delays in cargo deliveries",
  "text": "<p>The vessel backlogs at the heart of U.S. supply-chain congestion have receded in some places, but reared up in others, including East Coast ports, while other problems that have rippled across logistics networks remain in place. Warehouses are full. Trucking companies and railroads are short workers and equipment. And container yards at ports are jammed with hundreds of thousands of boxes.</p><p>At the nation's busiest port complex at Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., in April, containers sat in yards an average six days before being picked up by truck, and nine days to move by rail, according to the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association.</p><p>\"When you remember back to the fall of last year -- third and fourth quarter -- that was our biggest impediment, folks getting their cargo off the docks,\" said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. \"We've got to start digging into this backlog pretty quickly.\"</p><p>But around the country, officials at gateways say they are better prepared to deal with the coming import surge after more than a year of juggling clogged docks, vessel backups and record import volumes.</p><p>Ports note that they have overhauled operations to better cope with congestion before it gets out of hand. They have extended operating hours to handle more containers and set up pop-up container yards to store overflow boxes. There is better and more frequent communication across the supply chain -- between ocean shipping lines, retailers, truckers, warehouse and third-party logistics operators -- so they can anticipate and respond to cargo needs, port officials say.</p><p>Despite those assurances, shipping customers are wary -- and bracing for more delays.</p><p>Three-quarters of shipping industry professionals surveyed by Container xChange, an online marketplace for buying and leasing boxes, said this year's peak season will be as bad or worse than last year's. Target Corp. executives, during a recent earnings call, forecast $1 billion of higher-than-expected freight expenses this year amid soaring fuel and shipping costs, and said they don't expect supply-chain pressures to recede until 2023.</p><p>But there are signs of a softening in shipping demand. Retailers such as Target and Walmart Inc. are pulling back on some orders as consumer spending shifts from goods to services. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in a recent report said they expect restocking to slow, especially in sectors such as home furnishings and electronics that have seen dimming demand.</p><p>A slowdown in imports could give ports the breathing room they need.</p><p>\"I just can't see a big peak season,\" said Craig Grossgart, senior vice president of global ocean freight for Itasca, Ill.-based freight forwarder Seko Logistics. Container shipping line Ocean Network Express, he said, recently increased Seko's weekly space allocation on vessels by 15%, suggesting there is more room on ships.</p><p>Even a gradual increase in container volumes this peak season could present a challenge for ports. Import volumes were up 6.6% at major U.S. ocean gateways during the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, marking the start of a record year, according to research and consulting firm Beacon Economics.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
