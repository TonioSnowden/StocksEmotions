  "text": "<p>New technologies such as artificial intelligence and robots offer new possibilities. We must not be swept aside but must surf this technological wave. Ours is a young, dynamic continent, with a massive untapped market. We cannot and must not be judged by our past when our potential for greatness and inclusive prosperity is so enormous.</p><p>In previous technological revolutions, Africa was at best a spectator and not a player. Now, Africa's youthful population must provide an invaluable demographic dividend.</p><p>It is time to discard the inward-looking, tired notion that our focus must be on African solutions to African problems. Covid taught us that we are one humanity, intertwined. The key is to invest smartly in science and technology and to ensure Africans are at the forefront of progress. Africans can and must play an active and meaningful role in finding global solutions to global problems.We must use our endowment of green minerals to build a solid industrial base</p><p>Take the minerals of the future, those that will underpin the urgent and inevitable decarbonisation of the global economy. They are mainly in Africa. So how do we leverage this to maximise Africa's contribution and benefit? No longer can we tolerate the paradox that we are the richest continent in resources, but the poorest in economic development. We must use our endowment of green minerals to build a solid industrial base and contribute to the global fight against climate change.</p><p>Energy security looms large, and we must pivot our focus towards green energy in Africa—not just through the supply of minerals, but by tapping our own potential in solar and wind power, and in cutting-edge technologies like green hydrogen.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is unacceptable that just 1% of the vaccines used in Africa are produced there. Now that Africa has proved its capacity and capability to be a world-class vaccine manufacturer through Aspen Pharmacare's state-of-the-art facility in South Africa, why doesn't the world source and procure more of its vaccines from Africa?</p><p>Nobody is suggesting that implementing this continental reset will be easy. The challenges are daunting. We will need institutions that work, capable leaders, civil servants and private-sector professionals who are qualified, disciplined, capable and educated. And there should be no room for corruption. Impossible? Of course not. Look at countries like Singapore that deliver. They have the right people in the right jobs doing the right things, with proper management skills—not the political appointees who infest some parts of Africa.</p><p>We must improve our governance systems with institutions that inspire trust and confidence among Africans. For Africa to take off, the private sector also needs to be more actively involved. We need more private-sector solutions to Africa's public-sector problems—to get things moving at all levels, from local to regional to national.</p><p>Meanwhile, Africa must reset its relationship with the world, and move from being a historically inefficient and often corrupt recipient of aid to a strategic partner. Now is the time for Africa to pivot from aid to trade and investment, as the foundation for a new strategic and mutually beneficial partnership with the world at large.</p><p>Africa must become a magnet to attract and retain foreign direct investment. It is wrong that Africa receives the lowest share of global FDI. Through investment in science and technology, Africa can reset the terms of its engagement with the rest of the world. This will require the retention of African talent. Far too many of our brightest entrepreneurs move elsewhere to realise their professional dreams. In many cases they leave because they have lost faith in our institutions.</p><p>It is a fallacy that others must develop Africa. Europe, North America and Asia all developed internally, and now, with a little help from its friends, Africa must drive its own development. Our destiny is in our own hands. Africa can and will be a first-world continent in our lifetime—provided we have the vision and courage to do what it takes.</p><p>■</p><p>Kuseni Dlamini, chairman of Massmart and Aspen Pharmacare</p><p>This article appeared in the Africa section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2023 under the headline “It's time for a continental reset”</p>",
