  "text": "<p>The results came after its big-box retail peer Walmart Inc. recorded rising sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year and stronger profit in the holiday period.</p><p>For the full year, Target's revenue hit $106 billion, compared with $77.1 billion for the year ended Feb. 1, 2020, before the pandemic upended the global economy and consumer buying patterns.</p><p>Target has benefited from a surge in demand for home delivery and its service that allows customers to buy online and pick up in-store. Comparable sales during the most recent quarter rose by double-digit percentages across its five main categories of goods including food, apparel and home, the company said.</p><p>Overall profit rose nearly 12% to $1.54 billion, or $3.21 a share, in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Strong revenue growth helped offset higher supply-chain costs and spending on wages. Excluding one-time items, Target posted earnings of $3.19 a share, ahead of the $2.85 a share expected by analysts, according to FactSet.</p><p>On Monday, Target said it plans to raise wages this year, offering hourly workers a starting wage of $15 to $24 an hour.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, Target expects a low- to mid-single-digit percentage increase in revenue from 2021 and adjusted earnings per share to rise by a high-single-digit percentage. For the most recent year, adjusted earnings per share hit $13.56.</p><p>The company will hold an investor day and conference call to discuss earnings Tuesday morning.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Target Profit Rises as Annual Revenue Crosses $100 Billion</p>",
