  "title": "EXCHANGE --- MyPillow Pulled Off Walmart Shelves",
  "text": "<p>A Walmart spokeswoman said MyPillow products remain available online. She declined to elaborate on the decision.</p><p>Mr. Lindell, in a phone interview, said he believes Walmart pulled MyPillow products from shelves because of his advocacy against electronic voting machines. But he said Walmart executives told him MyPillow products didn't meet the retailer's internal rating criteria, and for that reason, it was removing his product from shelves.</p><p>MyPillow sales have increased recently, Mr. Lindell said. He said he offered a lower price on his products, which Walmart refused.</p><p>Dominion Voting Systems sued Mr. Lindell and MyPillow for more than $1.3 billion in damages last year. The suit asserts Mr. Lindell made false accusations that Dominion had rigged the 2020 election for President Biden. Mr. Lindell countersued; a judge in May dismissed the countersuit.</p><p>No court or election authority has found widespread fraud in the 2020 election.</p><p>Mr. Lindell said he expects MyPillow will lose around $20 million a year, adding that Walmart is the largest seller of his company's flagship product.</p><p>In addition to pillows, MyPillow sells towels, sheets and mattresses. Other retailers have also stopped selling MyPillow products since Mr. Lindell began promoting the election-fraud claims. Twitter Inc. permanently suspended Mr. Lindell last year for repeatedly violating its civic-integrity policy, Twitter has said.</p>",
