He has also lost his favoured form of communication after being banned from Twitter.</p> <p>However, his support among Republican activists shows few signs of wavering. A straw poll at the conference, conducted before Trump's speech, found he was the most popular potential Republican candidate for 2024, enjoying 55 per cent support among those present. His nearest rival, the Republican governor of Florida Ron DeSantis, polled 21 per cent.
