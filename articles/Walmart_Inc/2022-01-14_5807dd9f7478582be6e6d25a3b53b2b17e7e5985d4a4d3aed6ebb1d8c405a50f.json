  "title": "Altura Banks $110 Million So Far to Back Businesses With Diverse Leaders; The firm seeks $300 million to invest in smaller companies, particularly ones led by women and people of color in underserved U.S. communities",
  "text": "<p>One fund, Altura Capital Fund III LP has a $250 million target and primarily provides credit and growth equity to companies with $2 million to $10 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, two of the people said.</p><p>The second, Altura Economic Opportunity Fund I, has a smaller, $50 million goal and makes equity investments in businesses with $1 million to $10 million of Ebitda and located in what are called Qualified Opportunity Zones under U.S. tax law. The zones are economically distressed communities where new investments under certain conditions can receive preferential federal tax treatment.</p><p>Last year, the more than $260 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund approved $40 million in commitments to Fund III through its credit and emerging manager strategies, pension documents show. Meanwhile, Woodforest National Bank disclosed a commitment to the opportunity zone fund.</p><p>As part of its strategy, Altura seeks to help the companies it backs gain access to corporate vendor and supplier programs, particularly those geared to businesses managed by people with racially or gender-diverse backgrounds. It's a strategy the firm cultivated with success through its $147 million Small Business Community Capital II impact fund, which it launched with support from the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC program.</p><p>For example, one of the people said that through that fund, the team backed Pasteleria Cidrines Inc. in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in 2015. The company makes breads, pastries and baked goods. Altura helped Cidrines expand its distribution across the U.S., and its products are now stocked by Walmart Inc. stores, including Sam's Club, as well as Kroger Co. supermarkets.</p><p>Other companies that Altura backed through the SBIC fund include digital-marketing and public-relations agency Lippe Taylor, printer-supplies company Imaging Supplies Consolidation LLC and air-ambulance company MedX AirOne, according to the SBIC's website.</p><p>Chief Executive and President Monika Mantilla co-founded Coral Gables, Fla.-based Altura in 2005 with her husband, Managing Partner Jay Garcia, and the two run the firm with Managing Partner Carlos Singoret and Partner Judy Frodigh.</p><p>Ms. Mantilla drew from a network of relationships with large corporations that she developed over the years, including as an investment-management consultant and through nine years spent working with a global logistics company to build up the firm, one of the people said.</p><p>Write to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
