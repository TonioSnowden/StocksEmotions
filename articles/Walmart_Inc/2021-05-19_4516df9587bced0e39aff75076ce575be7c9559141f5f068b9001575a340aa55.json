Manufacturing also continues to progress, as evidenced by the German truck mileage index, which is well above its pre-pandemic levels. The mood of optimism, at least for the short term, is also reflected in surveys of European company bosses.</p> <p>Amid the encouraging wave of data, it fell to the ECB this morning, in its twice-yearly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de2ddeb2-c557-4f7e-af6b-54d3cbaaaa78\">financial stability report</a>, to inject a note of caution.</p> <p>Despite increased optimism on growth — new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f0e15c1-539c-41b3-87b5-514ae2eddbc0\">forecasts</a> show expansion of 4.3 per cent this year and 4.4 per cent in 2022 — the bank warned of the pandemic's legacy of higher debt and weaker balance sheets. If unaddressed, this could end in “sharp market corrections and financial stress or lead to a prolonged period of weak economic recovery”, it said.</p> <p>If that scenario wasn't scary enough, the ECB again conjured up the spectre of “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13918a23-db39-48fd-b812-4fc9c1d82698\">corporate zombification” </a>— legions of living dead companies kept alive by cheap loans and government aid. “Zombification may lead to an inefficient capital allocation, but also poses medium-term risks to the financial system if risks are not properly priced,” it said. </p> <p>The report follows a warning last month from the European Systemic Risk Board, which monitors the EU financial system, of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c843dd94-91f7-444d-a3c7-5e0d7dd160d5\"> a “tsunami” of insolvencies</a> once pandemic emergency measures were withdrawn. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aad5fe09-ec96-4390-b1b5-20e2464bc170\">European investors</a>, meanwhile, are anxiously awaiting minutes from the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting later today for clues on when the Americans will take away their own punch bowl. </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de2ddeb2-c557-4f7e-af6b-54d3cbaaaa78\">Frankfurt bureau chief Martin Arnold notes</a>, the ECB has (partially, at least) acknowledged its own part in sustaining the debt-ridden and unproductive hordes — the question is whether it will take its own advice, focus on saving viable companies and let the zombies finally rest in peace.</p> <p><em>Chart the progress of global economic recovery with our pandemic </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272354f2-f970-4ae4-a8ae-848c4baf8f4a\"><em>impact tracker</em></a></p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p><strong>UK inflation</strong> more than doubled to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f04bdd59-6070-45d8-9b99-d9ef17d62601\">1.5 per cent</a> in April, fuelled by energy bills and rises in petrol prices. Without the temporary cut to value added tax for the hospitality sector, the headline figure would stand at 3.2 per cent, the highest in nine years. <strong>House prices</strong>, meanwhile, have hit their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7855983-9db3-48f3-802f-dc4d3a11dae1#post-c5d3a3d0-57ac-447e-ae42-d3faebebb891\">highest level ever</a>. The <strong>labour market</strong> improved in the first quarter, with the unemployment rate dropping from 5.1 per cent to 4.8 per cent as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6168a2c-dcf5-4e0a-9237-9eed20de2bc0\">companies began rehiring</a> ahead of economic reopening.</p> <p><strong>Japan's</strong> economy shrank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77670e5c-dd3e-4b4c-ba92-68605f2b3309\">1.3 per cent</a> in the first quarter as it was hit by a new wave of pandemic restrictions, hurting consumer spending. One of the slowest vaccination programmes in the world — just 3.5 per cent of the population has had a first dose — suggests bounceback will not be swift.</p> <p>There are many reasons for the recent jump in <strong>US inflation</strong>, writes chief economics commentator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d2aef18-e9c4-486a-8323-c5fc6addf5f7\">Martin Wolf</a>, but politics is the driving force. Tightening monetary policy will be unpopular, “yet if a central bank does not take away the punch bowl before the party gets going”, he argues, “it has to take it away from people who have become addicted to it”.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> won an initial victory at an EU court against rival airlines in Portugal and the Netherlands receiving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3e6b8e7-977f-4b66-8b1f-0faf240e90d4\">state aid</a> during the pandemic last year. “The EU Commission's spineless approach to state aid since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis has allowed member states to write open-ended cheques to their inefficient zombie flag carriers,” Ryanair said. </p> <p><strong>Walmart</strong>, the world's biggest retailer, enjoyed its strongest-ever first quarter as Americans spent their government stimulus payments. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7855983-9db3-48f3-802f-dc4d3a11dae1#post-c9ac52be-ef1f-4b0f-ba9d-922cf7815564\">Target</a>, The Home Depot and Macy's also reported strong sales. Many US retailers have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f703ac2-7b3e-4ffa-9a75-b1b4da7d186d\">dropped the requirement</a> for (fully vaccinated) customers to wear masks. </p> <p>Business groups urged help for UK companies struggling to <strong>repay debt</strong> built up during the pandemic when Covid-19 emergency measures preventing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f63d76fb-4b09-46c9-9fc3-08bdcff87b36\">winding-up petitions</a> expire next month. Shareholders, meanwhile, continue to protest against <strong>big payouts</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62d4fd7c-aa73-43a5-9fb9-5962c1a0baed\">company bosses</a>. </p> <p><em>There's still time to join our Business of Luxury Summit, where creatives, executives and analysts from across the global luxury industry discuss how they are coping with the impact of Covid-19.

Investors have already priced in the probability of a strong recovery, explains US equities correspondent Aziza Kasumov, and are now focused on risk factors such as rising input costs.</p> <p>Lenders hit by US <strong>corporate debt defaults</strong> have been struggling to recoup their losses. Moody's rating agency said the average <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9075329d-ef6b-481e-91ee-a8f02ac621d6\">recovery rate</a> on bonds and loans was 45 cents on the dollar — compared with the historical average of more than 50 — thanks to looser underwriting standards and changes in the way debt is structured.</p> <p>The price of <strong>Brent crude</strong> hit $70 yesterday as global economic recovery strengthened prospects for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83b10e14-d143-4951-a315-cd4170320ac3\">oil demand</a>. Obstacles to further growth include fears that coronavirus variants could yet get out of control as well as an acceleration in the shift to renewable energy. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>Badger comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7743cf6-d473-432f-8292-201b5e5d6f1e?commentID=837bd230-2925-493d-a12c-49d668827ff8\">Johnson looks at swift easing of homeworking rules in England</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Working from home can have some benefits, but it's only when I started going back into the office (two to three days there and the rest from home) a couple of months ago that I realised how much better it is than working from home. Issues that would have otherwise taken days to resolve via email or instant messaging I got instant responses to, due to being able to talk directly. Furthermore the mental separation between work and personal life by doing the two in different locations has really benefited me mentally.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>With global travel restrictions starting to loosen, foodies can start salivating again at returning to their favourite emporiums.
