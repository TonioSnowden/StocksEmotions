  "title": "Albertsons Faces Outrage in Aisle Five; Planned $4 billion special dividend has stoked anger over supermarket giant's proposed combination with Kroger, but payout isn't nearly as damaging as some critics fear",
  "text": "<p>Washington state's attorney general argued that paying the special dividend would leave Albertsons financially weakened, less able to compete with Kroger during the antitrust-review process. He also suggested Kroger could use that point to its advantage—by arguing that Albertsons would go bankrupt without the merger.</p><p>It is a tenuous theory. While Albertsons' credit rating falls under the noninvestment grade umbrella, its financial position has never been better. Its net debt as of last quarter about equaled its trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet—a ratio about on par with that of big-box stalwart Walmart Inc. Kroger, by comparison, held 1.4 times as much net debt as Ebitda in its most recent quarter. The special dividend payout would leave Albertsons' net debt at roughly 1.9 times Ebitda, around where it was a year ago.</p><p>Credit-rating company Moody's, which uses total debt and factors in lease liabilities, expects Albertsons' debt-to-Ebitda ratio to return to its end-of-fiscal-2021 level a year or so after the special dividend is paid out. Chedly Louis, senior credit officer at Moody's, noted that Albertsons is expected to retain good liquidity following the special dividend payout even if the merger agreement doesn't go through. \"They performed very well during the pandemic and repaid a lot of debt, so they do have flexibility to pay the dividend,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the interest rate on the asset-based loan that Albertsons will draw from to fund the dividend payout is fairly modest at 1.25 to 1.5 percentage points over Libor.</p><p>So while the special dividend itself shouldn't be all that controversial, its timing might be. A generous special dividend by a supermarket chain that is majority owned by private-equity investors (at a time of record food inflation, no less) was bound to stoke anger about consumer choice and private-equity greed. Yet announcing a special dividend before the merger agreement would have been more problematic: A public Albertsons shareholder who chose to sell the company's stock soon after pocketing the special dividend could have felt misled if it emerged later that Albertsons was in discussions with Kroger about a deal that would lift its stock price.</p><p>The outrage over the payout and the deal are overblown: Albertsons and Kroger are in an industry with razor-thin margins. Combining would help them scale up and better compete with well-capitalized e-commerce competitors. In any case, the two chains' combined grocery market share would still fall short of that of Walmart, which has stores within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population and is unlikely to give up its everyday-low-prices positioning.</p><p>Nevertheless, the pushback the deal is already facing doesn't bode well for Albertsons' shareholders who were looking for a rare bonanza in a tough business.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Albertsons Faces Outrage in Aisle Five</p>",
