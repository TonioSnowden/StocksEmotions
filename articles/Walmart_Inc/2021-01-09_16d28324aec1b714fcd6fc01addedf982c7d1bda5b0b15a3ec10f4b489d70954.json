  "title": "REVIEW --- Weekend Confidential: James Rogers --- A young CEO's firm applies an edible, plant-based coating to fruits and vegetables that extends their shelf life without refrigeration.",
  "text": "<p>Apeel-treated avocados, limes, apples and cucumbers are already in some of the largest grocery chains in the U.S. and Europe. The startup now plans to expand into markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America, thanks to a $30 million investment from the International Finance Corp., the World Bank's private-sector arm. The company Mr. Rogers launched in 2012 as a Ph.D. student is now valued at more than $1 billion.</p><p>\"Perishability governs every element of the food system,\" Mr. Rogers says. Fruits and vegetables start to lose their value once they are picked, and producers, suppliers, retailers and consumers all race to get those berries and leaves into someone's mouth before they spoil.</p><p>This urgency forces trade-offs. Most retailers arrange produce in unrefrigerated displays, which sells food faster but ensures that everything rots sooner. Asparagus turns so quickly that most international imports come by air, which gives these tender spears a larger carbon footprint than pork or veal, according to a study in the Journal of Industrial Ecology.</p><p>Despite this haste, there is plenty of waste. More than a third of the food produced today is never eaten, at a global cost of $2.6 trillion a year, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.</p><p>\"How do you get to zero waste? When you perfectly match supply and demand,\" Mr. Rogers says. Yet perishability narrows the window for making this match. The pandemic's disruptions to supply chains have further compromised this equation. \"There's now an awareness of just how fragile our food system is,\" Mr. Rogers says. With Apeel, he hopes to keep more food out of landfills by giving everyone more time.</p><p>Mr. Rogers was a graduate student in materials science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, when he first sensed that time was key to solving the world's food problems. His Ph.D. mostly concerned solar power, but his preoccupations soon shifted from energy to food. He found himself dogged by a nagging question: Why do so many people go hungry when there is so much food in the world?</p><p>The answer, he discovered, is that food is an intermittent asset (\"Either it's in season and you have more than you know what to do with, or it's out of season and there's not enough\"), and most farmers lack the time and wherewithal to bring their harvest to market. If produce took longer to spoil, poor farmers could sell their wares to distant customers. But how, he wondered, could he \"create more time for food?\"</p><p>As a materials scientist, Mr. Rogers is trained to understand \"everything about how everything is made and how it works.\" Like the boy who believed he could confect novelties from ordinary nuts and bolts, he tends to assume that the solution to thorny problems can be found in everyday materials and the \"magic\" of living things.</p><p>He began to study the differences between foods that \"had time,\" such as lemons and oranges, and those that didn't, like strawberries and cucumbers. He discovered that the exteriors of both sorts of fruit are composed of the same molecules, just arranged differently. He hoped to use the lessons of lemon peels to sustain strawberries, but he wasn't sure how. To move forward, he needed money.</p><p>\"When we got started, we didn't have a product, but a philosophy,\" Mr. Rogers says. Inspired by the potential of \"using food to preserve food,\" the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation helped launch Apeel with a $100,000 grant. Nine years on and more than $380 million in funding later, Mr. Rogers says the company is now accomplishing what it set out to do. \"It's kind of crazy to even talk about it, but we're in tens of thousands of grocery stores around the world,\" he says.</p><p>All fruits and vegetables spoil by the same process -- water goes out, oxygen comes in -- but creating an invisible barrier that locks in moisture requires a different formula for each one. Using the lipids and glycerolipids of existing peels, seeds and pulp (i.e., things we already eat), Apeel has created a safe, flavorless, FDA-approved solution for dozens of products, which it applies while wet to the surface of harvested produce on specially outfitted conveyor belts just before everything is packaged for export. This invisible \"peel\" can double or triple the lifespan of a product, the firm says.</p><p>But adding shelf life to produce is one thing; convincing suppliers and retailers that this time has value is another. \"What we found was there wasn't a market for longer-lasting produce,\" Mr. Rogers says with a chuckle. Most businesses told him that perishability kept their customer coming back for more.</p><p>Mr. Rogers has had to prove that more time not only reduced waste but also boosted sales. According to the Edeka Group, which runs more than 11,000 grocery stores in Germany, a pilot launch of Apeel avocados in nearly 3,000 stores in 2020 resulted in 50% less waste and a 20% rise in sales. Edeka swiftly agreed to carry Apeel avocados, oranges and clementines across all of its stores.</p><p>Although the average American household is estimated to throw away nearly a third of its food, retailers are the most conspicuous beneficiaries of an extended shelf life. \"A lot of waste is invisible, but grocers keep track,\" Mr. Rogers notes. Apeel mostly partners with grocers and uses the purchase orders to work with producers and suppliers around the world. Walmart, the country's largest food retailer, recently began carrying Apeel's English cucumbers, which don't need a protective sleeve of plastic.</p><p>Because these deals save retailers money, Apeel products aren't pricier than more perishable alternatives, Mr. Rogers says: \"We're saying when you purchase this item for the same or lower cost, you are voting for a food system that will look after more people and our planet.\"</p><p>Mr. Rogers had been a student all his life when he launched Apeel at age 27. Did his youth and inexperience create problems? \"It may have helped,\" he says. \"I didn't know what I didn't know, so I wasn't overwhelmed.\"</p><p>He has discovered, for example, that every fruit and vegetable has its own idiosyncratic supply chain, and Apeel works to pinpoint where time has the most value. He has also learned that delivering avocados to Europeans throughout the year means working with lots of different countries (Chile, Israel, Morocco, South Africa, etc.), each of which has its own unique supply chain, regulatory hurdles and distinct avocado.</p><p>\"Working at a startup, you just have to really love puzzles,\" he says. \"Your reward for solving your current puzzle? A bigger and more complicated puzzle.\"</p>",
