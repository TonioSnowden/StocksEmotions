  "title": "At Least 46 Found Dead in San Antonio in Suspected Migrant Smuggling Operation; Sixteen survivors suffered from heat-related ailments, in what federal officials say appears to be the deadliest such incident ever in the U.S.",
  "text": "<p>San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said at a press briefing that his department transported 16 survivors to hospitals, four of whom were teenagers or young adults.</p><p>The nationalities of the deceased couldn't be determined.</p><p>\"The patients that we saw were hot to the touch. They were suffering from heat stroke, heat exhaustion,\" Mr. Hood said, adding that there were no signs of water in the trailer and there was no visible air-conditioning unit on the vehicle.</p><p>San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said three people were in custody but didn't provide details on who they were or what they were arrested for, saying the investigation was in the hands of federal agents. He said the trailer was discovered after a local worker heard a cry for help and went to investigate.</p><p>Temperatures in San Antonio broke triple digits on Monday, according to National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill. The high topped out at 103 degrees, just one degree shy of the 104-degree record set on June 27, 2012, Mr. Churchill said.</p><p>Federal immigration officials routinely run safety campaigns warning migrants against traveling in tractor trailers because of the possibility of overheating.</p><p>\"This speaks to the desperation of migrants who would put their lives in the hands of callous human smugglers who show no regard for human life,\" Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus said Monday night. \"We will be working with our federal, state and local partners to assist in every way possible with this investigation.\"</p><p>San Antonio is located about 150 miles from the Mexican border and is a major transit point for migrants. In 2017, the dead bodies of 10 people were found in a tractor trailer in a Walmart parking lot in the city.</p><p>San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said Monday's discovery was \"nothing short of a horrific human tragedy.\"</p><p>\"We hope that those responsible for putting these people in such inhumane conditions are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" he said.</p><p>The incident is being investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations division.</p><p>â€”Michael Wright contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alicia A.
