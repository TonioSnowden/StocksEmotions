  "title": "Business News: Wrangler, Lee Owner Raises Earnings Outlook",
  "text": "<p>The Greensboro, N.C., company last year took a hit from pandemic-related store closures, but it is optimistic about sales rising this year as vaccination rates increase and consumers spend more money. Kontoor said last week it expects adjusted earnings per share of between $3.70 to $3.80 for 2021. That is up from its previous guidance issued in March of $3.50 to $3.60.</p><p>\"We've had strong momentum in both of our brands,\" said Rustin Welton, the company's finance chief and a former VF executive, referring to Lee and Wrangler. Revenue for both brands rose by about 30% to $649 million for the quarter ended April 3 compared with a year earlier. Kontoor earned $64.5 million during the quarter, compared with a $2.7 million loss a year before.</p><p>The company looks to benefit from the shift to casual office attire that began before the pandemic, Mr. Welton said, echoing comments from executives at other clothing firms, such as Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Kontoor offers some jeans with flexible waistbands and jogger pants.</p><p>Mr. Welton also has been paying down debt, which helped free up cash. The company had $586 million in net debt as of April 3, down about 36% from a year earlier. Kontoor, which took on $1.05 billion in financial obligations as part of the spinoff, plans to provide more details about its debt-reduction and investment plans at its May 24 investor day.</p><p>Kontoor is primarily a U.S. wholesaler, with 68% of its net revenue in 2020 coming from retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. Direct-to-consumer sales made up 12% of Kontoor's revenue, including sales from Lee and Wrangler's full-price and outlet stores, as well as the brands' websites. The rest was generated by a mix of international wholesale and sales of third-party branded merchandise that was discontinued in 2020.</p><p>Kontoor plans to increase the share of sales that come from its own websites, Mr. Welton said. \"We really see it as a capital-efficient way for us to grow,\" he said.</p><p>The company also wants to diversify its product offering further, Mr. Welton said.</p>",
