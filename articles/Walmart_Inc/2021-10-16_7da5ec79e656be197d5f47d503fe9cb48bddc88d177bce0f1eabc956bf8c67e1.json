  "title": "Judges or Their Brokers Bought And Sold Stocks of Litigants --- 61 report trades made while they oversaw suits involving the companies",
  "text": "<p>The Wall Street Journal discovered this trading in a broad investigation that identified 131 federal judges who heard hundreds of cases between 2010 and 2018 involving companies in which they or a family member owned stock -- in violation of federal law and judicial-ethics rules.</p><p>Judges Lewis, Norgle and Siragusa were among 61 judges who didn't just own stocks of companies that were litigants in their courtrooms. Accounts held by the judges or their families traded shares as suits were progressing, the Journal's investigation found. Nearly half of the judges reported more than one trade while a case was in progress.</p><p>Federal law and ethics rules say judges must recuse themselves if they, their spouse or any minor children own even a single share of a company that is a plaintiff or defendant in a case before them.</p><p>Some judges, when contacted by the Journal, said they were unaware that brokers or advisers who managed accounts for them traded shares of the firms during the cases. But there is no exception for holdings in managed accounts. U.S. law requires judges to inform themselves about their financial interests.</p><p>Other judges said they failed to update their \"recusal lists\" -- tallies judges keep of parties they shouldn't have in their courtrooms -- in the middle of hearing cases. Federal courts use software to identify such parties, but it can't spot stocks judges buy unless they update their conflict lists.</p><p>Trading during a case \"can happen only if the judge is recklessly indifferent to the conflict-of-interest rules in the statute and the Canons of Ethics,\" said Arthur Hellman, an ethics specialist and law professor at the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>While Judge Walter Rice was hearing a case involving International Paper Co., his financial disclosure form shows, he sold between $15,001 and $50,000 of its stock in December 2015. The sale earned a profit of between $15,001 and $50,000, the form shows. Judge Rice said that later that month, he gave his remaining shares to five charities.</p><p>The case involved an effort to recoup cleanup costs from International Paper and other firms that operated a mill in Dayton, Ohio. During the case, which is pending, Judge Rice, who is in the Southern District of Ohio, has issued rulings both favorable and unfavorable to International Paper.</p><p>After being contacted by the Journal, Judge Rice informed parties to the case of the appearance of the conflict. \"In all candor, I am remiss at checking this as thoroughly as I should,\" he said.</p><p>Judge Rice said the stock was in an account whose manager \"can buy or sell without getting my permission.\" He said he wasn't aware he owned International Paper shares, likely because he wasn't reading the statements.</p><p>International Paper declined to comment.</p><p>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts on Wednesday warned judges in a memo they are required to keep informed about their finances and maintain timely lists of parties that are off limits. Judge Roslynn Mauskopf, director of the office, wrote that judges may not rely on accounts managed by financial advisers to avoid their recusal obligations.</p><p>In response to Journal articles on judges' recusal failures, lawmakers are proposing far-reaching changes. A bill being drafted by House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and Rep. Hank Johnson (D., Ga.), would require judges to report transactions such as stock trades within 90 days, a congressional aide said. Judges would also have to post their financial disclosures in a searchable database, and there would be civil penalties for recusal violations.</p><p>Judge Lewis, who owned Walmart stock, reported on a disclosure form five purchases of the shares in a six-day span while she presided in a suit against the company in August 2017.</p><p>Walmart and the plaintiff, an ex-employee seeking short-term disability benefits, told the judge early in August that they were exploring a settlement. Judge Lewis extended court deadlines to give them time to resolve the matter.</p><p>Her financial disclosure form recorded five purchases from three different accounts in quick succession. The form shows Walmart stock bought on Aug. 25, Aug. 29 and Aug. 30, 2017, the day Judge Lewis dismissed the case.</p><p>At the time, her retirement account and a trust each held as much as $15,000 of Walmart stock, and another trust held $15,001 to $50,000 worth, her disclosure form shows.</p><p>Judge Lewis, who is based in Columbia, S.C., declined requests for comment. After the Journal contacted her, the court clerk notified parties to the suit about her stock ownership, saying it \"neither affected nor impacted\" her court decisions but would have required her to recuse herself.</p><p>The clerk's letter invited the parties to respond and said a different judge would consider any response they filed. They didn't reply by an Aug. 9 deadline the letter set. Walmart didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Judge Norgle's 2010 financial disclosure form shows 11 purchases or sales of Pfizer shares while he oversaw a suit against the pharmaceutical company.</p><p>Before the suit, he acquired Pfizer shares worth between $15,001 and $50,000 on Feb. 3, 2010, and made three smaller purchases that month, the last on Feb. 17. Less than a week later, Judge Norgle was assigned to hear a lawsuit alleging that Pfizer falsely marketed an expired patent on packaging of Advil products.</p><p>His disclosure form shows trading continued in March with four more purchases and one sale of Pfizer stock -- three of the purchases valued at up to $15,000 each and one purchase and one sale valued at between $15,001 and $50,000. The form records six additional Pfizer trades in April and May, the last a sale of $15,001 to $50,000 of Pfizer stock on May 20.</p><p>Judge Norgle rejected Pfizer's motion to dismiss the case early the next year, and in May 2011 granted Pfizer's motion to transfer it to New Jersey federal court.</p><p>Judge Norgle, based in Chicago, didn't respond to requests for comment. The court clerk sent the lawsuit's parties a notice this month saying that the judge's stock ownership didn't affect his courtroom decisions but would have required his recusal. The parties hadn't filed a response as of Tuesday. Pfizer declined to comment.</p><p>Some judges ruled in favor of companies in which they reported purchasing shares during the case. An example was Judge Siragusa, who heard a suit against Medtronic involving an injured boy.</p><p>When the boy was 8, he fell off a motorized toy car and broke his neck, requiring surgery to implant a titanium rod. A surgeon inserted a Medtronic bone graft in his neck when he was 12. His family sued Medtronic in April 2014 alleging the graft was defective.</p><p>Judge Siragusa handled pretrial motions, scolding the family's attorney for missing deadlines. Eight months into the case, on Jan. 27, 2015, two purchases of Medtronic shares, each valued at up to $15,000, were made in two separate brokerage accounts of Judge Siragusa, his financial disclosure form shows.</p><p>Later in the year, Judge Siragusa asked the family's attorney at a hearing, \"So where are you going with this case? I don't know how . . . there would be a manufacturing defect.\"</p><p>He dismissed the case \"with prejudice,\" meaning the plaintiff couldn't amend and refile it. His 2015 financial disclosure form wasn't filed until 10 months later, in August 2016.</p><p>Judge Siragusa, based in Rochester, N.Y., said an investment adviser made the purchases without consulting him.</p><p>\"They control what stocks are bought and sold,\" he said. \"I'm sure they'll send me notifications of what's bought and sold.\" He said he doesn't keep track.</p><p>\"That's not to say I shouldn't have picked up on some of these, but we have a conflict checking system that is supposed to alert me if there's a conflict,\" he said.</p><p>A spokesman for Medtronic declined to comment. An attorney for the family didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In some cases, judges or their families made repeated trades in cases that spanned years. Judge Janis Sammartino in California heard 18 cases during which her family traded shares of plaintiffs or defendants in the suits.</p><p>In one, her family owned Pfizer stock in two trusts when she was assigned a Pfizer case in 2011. A biotech company accused Pfizer of infringing its patents for technologies used to research cancer treatments.</p><p>Judge Sammartino's disclosure forms recorded 14 trades of Pfizer shares during the nearly six years the case was in her court or on appeal, including eight sales that brought combined profit of $7,506 to $19,500.</p><p>The first trade, a sale for a profit of up to $1,000, came in December 2011, nearly a year after plaintiff AntiCancer Inc. filed suit.</p><p>Judge Sammartino threw out part of AntiCancer's case the following year. She offered the plaintiff a choice: Accept defeat on the remaining claims or amend its filing and continue, but only if it paid Pfizer's legal fees.</p><p>AntiCancer appealed that ruling in late 2012. The judge's family continued to trade Pfizer stock in the trusts, gaining a total of as much as $6,000 in profit in two sales, then buying more shares in the latter half of 2014.</p><p>AntiCancer won its appeal. \"The district court exceeded its discretionary authority in imposing a fee-shifting sanction as a condition of proceeding with the litigation,\" a federal appellate court said in October 2014, sending the case back to Judge Sammartino's court.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
