  "title": "Holiday Bargains for Retail Stocks; Shares of apparel sellers with anything less than a stellar outlook are seeing steep selloffs. Investors should smell an opportunity.",
  "text": "<p>Unlike retail giants Walmart and Target, apparel sellers are finding it harder to keep their shelves stocked. Gap, which reported its results after the market closed Tuesday, said inventory delays worsened throughout its quarter ended Oct. 30, causing it to lose roughly $300 million worth of sales because of supply constraints. Victoria's Secret, which reported earnings last week, said roughly 45% of the holiday items it ordered were delayed between two and nine weeks. Urban Outfitters and Nordstrom Rack, Nordstrom's discount arm, both also saw sales hampered last quarter by a lack of supply.</p><p>Inventory problems aren't unexpected given how much U.S. apparel makers lean on Vietnam, which has seen factory shutdowns since the summer. Still, the stumble at Gap was disappointing given its scale, which its executives frequently tout as a strength.</p><p>\"Other companies that paid money to ship goods by airâ€”that inventory is actually here and generating sales. Gap is a unique situation,\" notes Paul Lejuez, analyst at Citigroup.</p><p>Investors need not fret too much about stranded inventory, though. Last year, when the pandemic forced many stores to shut down, brands including Gap, Calvin Klein's parent company PVH Corp. and Carter's all packed away a substantial share of their inventory for later seasons instead of selling them at discounts. That tactic turned out to work at Gap, which now says it plans to do the same with holiday inventory that ends up arriving in January and February.</p><p>In-stock levels actually look better at Nordstrom than at department-store peers as of quarter-end, but the source of the selloff seems to be weakness at Nordstrom Rack, which continues to be a sore thumb next to rival highflying off-price sellers. Nordstrom Rack saw sales decline 8% last quarter compared with the 2019 quarter, a contrast to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, which collectively saw sales jump 14% in the U.S. over the same period. The full department store is actually doing fine, and the company left its guidance unchanged for the year.</p><p>Whatever the reason for the selloff, its sheer magnitude suddenly makes some of these retailers look attractive. Gap's share price as a multiple of forward revenue is now around 0.4 times, a 30% discount compared with its five-year average and more than half off compared with PVH Corp. Nordstrom's is at 0.2 times, half off compared with Macy's and Kohl's. Foot Locker, on the same basis, is 40% cheaper than Dick's Sporting Goods.</p><p>With racks looking emptier, shoppers looking for great deals might not find them this Black Friday. But investors might find some among unloved retail stocks.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Holiday Bargains for Retail Stocks</p>",
