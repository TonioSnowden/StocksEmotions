  "text": "<p>Tesco is expected to announce plans to return capital to shareholders when it reports half-year results on Wednesday, as the UK's largest food retailer looks to ignite a share price that has lagged behind rivals.</p> <p>Shares in the group have been the weakest performers among the UK's three listed food retailers so far this year, rising just 10 per cent despite its growing operational momentum.</p> <p>In contrast, shares in J Sainsbury have gained almost 30 per cent. Those of Wm Morrison, which has been the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b9e0c92-76cf-4c85-b097-afb48698b9df\">takeover battle</a> that was won on Saturday by US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, are up more than 60 per cen<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b9e0c92-76cf-4c85-b097-afb48698b9df\">t</a>.</p> <p>Returns have also lagged behind those of continental peers such as Ahold Delhaize and Carrefour. Yet analysts say Tesco, which prospered during the pandemic as pubs and restaurant were forced to close for extended periods, is increasingly dominating its home market once again.</p> <p>“For the first time in more than a decade, we believe Tesco is on real form,” noted HSBC analyst Andrew Porteous. “The previous team laid the groundwork in restructuring the operating model and starting to refine the commercial offer but new management have . . . really tightened up the business and driven sales”.</p> <p>According to research group Kantar, it is the only one of the Big Four grocers to maintain its market share since the start of 2020; rivals Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's have all ceded it, mostly to discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c63ffb0-61b1-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">selling its Asian operations</a> in March - and returning £5bn to shareholders via a special dividend — Tesco has reduced its debt and shored up its defined-benefit pension scheme. Both measures will increase its future profitability and cash flow.</p> <p>William Woods, an analyst at Bernstein, said Tesco was winning on multiple fronts — gaining share in almost all regions of the UK and among all age cohorts and social classes. </p> <p>Its relaunched Clubcard, which now offers holders big discounts on popular lines rather than the chance to accumulate points, has helped drive loyalty and recruit new customers. </p> <p>“It's very difficult to find a problem with execution, offer or customer appetite,” Woods concluded.</p> <p>One reason this momentum has not boosted the shares is that Tesco, with a market value greater than Morrisons and Sainsbury's combined, is regarded by many as being too big for a private-equity takeover. </p> <p>“It would be a big deal, although such is the liquidity out there, it is possible,” said Clive Black, research director at Shore Capital. “But the market is putting a pretty low probability on it”.</p> <p>Black thinks the company will use the half-year results to “set out a runway” that focuses investors' attention on the £1.5bn of free cash flow it could generate each year. </p> <p>“I don't think they'll start a buyback straight after the results, it's more likely to come in the spring,” he predicted, pointing out that finance director Imran Nawaz was relatively new in the job and that concern over food price inflation may also prompt a degree of caution. </p> <p>Food retailers are facing significant cost pressures from rising commodity prices, Brexit-related bureaucracy and higher wage costs, particularly for lorry drivers.</p> <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Tesco dominated UK food retailing with £1 in every £8 spent in UK shops going through its tills at its peak. Its influence was so great that its detractors dubbed it “the Tescopoly”.</p> <p>But Tesco suffered a spectacular fall from grace starting in 2011, losing customers, becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal and finally announcing one of the biggest UK corporate losses in 2015.</p> <p>Black thinks it is unlikely to recapture the dominance it enjoyed in its pomp, given how entrenched the German-owned discounters have become in the UK. “They are going to keep UK supermarkets honest,” he said.</p> <p>Tesco declined to comment.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Tesco banks on cash returns to reignite share price' FT.com 4 October.
