  "text": "<p>Stocks have mounted a furious climb in recent weeks as investors reassessed their belief that persistently high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming economic slowdown were making corporate shares a bad bet. Through Tuesday, the S&amp;P had jumped 17% from its June low as investors reshuffled portfolios and scrambled to cover bearish wagers.</p><p>A series of strong earnings reports, as well as data last week showing U.S. inflation eased in July, have spurred much of the recent optimism. Lowe's shares climbed 0.8% Wednesday after it reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations, following strong results Tuesday from Walmart and Home Depot. New retail-sales data showed that—excluding the effect of falling gasoline prices—consumer spending trended up last month in a sign of economic resilience.</p><p>Still, investors are wrestling anxiously with whether the recent rally marks a lasting turnaround to stocks' dismal first half of the year or whether it is destined to fade.</p><p>With inflation still a critical concern, the Fed is expected to keep raising rates, but investors are wondering how quickly and for how long. Traders have been caught between, on one side, comments from Fed officials who project raising rates through next year, and, on the other, market-based forecasts that expect the central bank to slow or reverse its rate hikes.</p><p>Government bond yields, highly sensitive to interest-rate expectations, have been rising in recent sessions, a sign that more traders have been heeding central bankers' policy-tightening projections. Chris Verrone, a partner at research firm Strategas, said that higher yields are a reason to doubt the stock-market rally's endurance.</p><p>\"The bond market is not sold on this idea that some Fed pivot is imminent,\" Mr. Verrone said. \"This idea of a Fed pivot—the data doesn't support it, and the bond market doesn't support it.\"</p><p>Treasury yields continued to rise on Wednesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.888%, up about 0.3 percentage points since the beginning of August. The yield on the 2-year note remained higher still, climbing to 3.354%, up nearly half a percentage point from a recent low the last week of July. That sustained a pattern known as an inverted yield curve, a bond-market signal considered a key recession predictor. Yields rise when bond prices decline.</p><p>In recent days, fed-funds futures, used by traders to place bets on how the Fed will set rates, have implied close to even odds that September will bring another 0.75-percentage-point Fed rate hike, as opposed to a smaller half-percentage-point move. Minutes from the Fed's recent meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, could offer more details about U.S. central bankers' plans.</p><p>Higher interest rates reduce the value that many investors' models assign to stock prices, so more hawkish signals from the Fed's minutes could pause the stock market's recent rally. And many money managers are still worried that the economy could continue to slow.</p><p>Alessio de Longis, head of tactical asset allocation at asset manager Invesco, said that funds he oversees have shifted to more conservative positioning in recent weeks—away from stocks in favor of bonds, and favoring defensive stocks over cyclical shares.</p><p>\"Building slack into the economy for the Fed means getting the unemployment rate to rise, and that hasn't even started,\" he said. \"Until that moves, they probably have to continue raising interest rates.\"</p><p>Earnings from Target on Wednesday presented a cloudy picture of the American consumer. Target's profit fell sharply, and the company said it saw customers cut spending on discretionary items. Still, revenue rose, boosted by strong sales of food and beverage, beauty and household items and more shopper visits. Shares fell 3.2%.</p><p>Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond jumped 12% in volatile trading as individual investors continued to pile into the stock, hoping to push shares even higher andpunish professionals who have bet against it.</p><p>In commodities, oil prices moved between gains and losses as fears of a global economic slowdown continue to hang over investors. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was roughly flat at $92.24 a barrel, following a few days of declines.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.9%. The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that consumer prices were 10.1% higher in July than the year before, up from 9.4% in June. Investors sold U.K. government bonds, reflecting expectations that the Bank of England will need to further raise interest rates to tame inflation.</p><p>In Asia, stocks moved higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5%, China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.2%.</p><p>Stocks Slip Ahead of Fed Minutes</p>",
