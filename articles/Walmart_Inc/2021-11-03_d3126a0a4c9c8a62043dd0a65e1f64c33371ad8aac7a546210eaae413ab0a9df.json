  "text": "<p>Federal law requires judges to disqualify themselves from cases if they, their spouse or minor children hold a financial interest in a plaintiff or defendant, including the interest of a beneficiary in assets held by a trust. The law requires a judge to disqualify when holding an equitable interest in a plaintiff or defendant, however small.</p><p>Each of the clerk's notices said the stock ownership by him or his wife's trust \"neither affected nor impacted Chief Judge Gilstrap's decisions, if he in fact made any decisions, in this case.\"</p><p>Parties who received the notices can ask the court to reopen their cases and have them heard by a new judge.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap didn't respond to requests to comment on the notices. He initially told the Journal in August he believed he had no duty to recuse himself from cases involving plaintiffs or defendants in which a family trust held stock or from cases in which he had little or no involvement.</p><p>\"I take my obligations related to potential conflicts/recusals seriously,\" Judge Gilstrap previously said in one of seven emails to the Journal. \"Throughout my judicial career, I have endeavored to comply with all such obligations, and I will continue to do so.\"</p><p>Judge Gilstrap had the most recusal violations among 131 judges found by the Journal to have failed to disqualify themselves from cases in which they or their families had a financial interest. Those 685 violations were found by comparing judges' financial-disclosure forms against their court dockets.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap, the subject of a recent article in the Journal, had several dozen more violations than the runner-up, a California federal judge who heard 54 cases involving companies held in her family's trusts. After being contacted by the Journal, federal judges now have gone to court in 509 cases to notify parties of their recusal violations.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap, an Obama appointee, hears among the highest number of patent-infringement cases in the U.S. His disqualification notices could throw the docket of the small Texas courthouse into disarray, according to legal-ethics and patent experts.</p><p>The judge's recusal notifications primarily involved violations found by the Journal ending in 2018, the last year financial disclosures have been released in bulk. In most of those cases, the suits had settled and it is unclear whether parties will decide to go into court and reopen those cases.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap also has a number of cases currently on his docket with some of those same companies, which might still pose potential conflicts if he or his wife continues to own stocks in those companies.</p><p>A Journal review of the judge's docket since 2019 shows that there could be two dozen or more cases before the judge involving his family's investments, presuming the financial holdings of Judge Gilstrap and a trust created for his wife haven't changed in the past two years.</p><p>That would give parties an option to seek a new judge, legal experts said.</p><p>University of Houston law Prof. Renee Knake Jefferson said Judge Gilstrap's handling of his financial recusals now presents administrative challenges \"on a court with fewer than a dozen fellow district judges.\" She said it highlights the need for reform of laws on financial recusals.</p><p>\"The law does not automatically require vacating the judgment if parties learn after the matter has concluded that the judge should have recused,\" Prof. Jefferson said. \"The remedy is a discretionary decision, and one left to the judge who failed to recuse.\"</p><p>In the notices filed in Judge Gilstrap's cases, the clerk said that Judge Gilstrap wouldn't participate in considering any response or request for a new judge. The notices of recusal violations gave parties 30 days to respond.</p><p>News of potential conflicts also could change the calculus of plaintiffs who seek out the small federal court in Marshall, Texas, in expectation that Judge Gilstrap, the chief judge of the Eastern District of Texas, will handle their cases.</p><p>\"If you know that Judge Gilstrap will have to recuse because of a financial conflict that removes a big incentive to file in the Eastern District\" because Judge Gilstrap's rulings and court procedures are why many plaintiffs have filed there, said Temple University law Prof. Paul Gugliuzza.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap's \"stock ownership would have required recusal\" in four cases involving Alcoa Corp., Walt Disney Co., Exxon and McDonald's, said notices by David O'Toole, clerk of the court. In 134 other cases, the notices involved high-profile companies including Microsoft, International Business Machines Corp., medical-device maker Medtronic PLC, financial-services giant JPMorgan, and retailers Walmart, Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc.</p><p>These are companies held in a trust in which Judge Gilstrap's wife has an interest, according to the notices. \"The trust's stock ownership may have required recusal,\" the clerk said.</p><p>When first contacted by the Journal in August, Judge Gilstrap said he had overreported on his financial disclosure forms the holdings in his wife's trust, and he said his handling of other cases that conflicted with his stockholdings were \"ministerial\" in nature.</p><p>\"My wife is the beneficiary of a Trust Account and an Agency Account established by her parents for her and managed by financial professionals who are compensated for their management,\" he wrote in a statement emailed on Aug. 25. \"Out of an abundance of caution, I have also included these matters in my annual financial reports.\" He said, \"I do not believe these assets are a basis for a possible conflict.\"</p><p>Judge Gilstrap also initially disputed that he was required to recuse in cases largely handled by a magistrate judge or in which he issued no major rulings. Judge Gilstrap subsequently received a letter from the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the federal judiciary. \"The Code requires recusal when a judge has a financial conflict, regardless of the substance of the judge's actual involvement in the case,\" the committee said in a letter dated Sept. 2.</p><p>---</p><p>Gilstrap Steps Back</p><p>From 10 Lawsuits</p><p>In addition to filing dozens of notices of possible recusal violations in closed cases, U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap recently removed himself from 10 ongoing lawsuits filed by Team Worldwide Corp., a Taiwanese company that makes inflatable beds.</p><p>The suits allege that retailers such as Home Depot and Target sold Chinese-made products that infringed Team Worldwide patents related to air-bed technologies. Most of the lawsuits were filed in 2019. Financial disclosure forms for 2019 and 2020 haven't been released by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in bulk.</p><p>Magistrate Judge Roy Payne recommended in rulings in the spring that Judge Gilstrap deny pretrial motions by the defendants and Team Worldwide.</p><p>The case has been on hold since June at the request of both sides, while they wait for an administrative court to issue a ruling that could affect the claims asserted by Team Worldwide in federal court in Texas.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap issued an order of recusal on Oct. 22, taking himself off the case without explanation.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap's 2018 financial disclosure forms list holdings of both Home Depot ($15,001 to $50,000) and Target (as much as $15,000).</p><p>Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. declined to comment. A lawyer for Team Worldwide didn't respond to requests to comment.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
