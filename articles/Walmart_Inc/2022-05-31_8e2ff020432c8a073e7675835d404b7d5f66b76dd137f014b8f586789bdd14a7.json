  "text": "<p>Retailer B&amp;M has said it expects profit to fall below the pandemic-driven highs of the past two years, in a sign that even discounters are not immune to the squeeze on household incomes in the UK.</p> <p>Citing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, much higher <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/77b28b2b-7a5c-4103-a86f-9af8ba039296\">inflation </a>and the potential effects of customers buying different kinds of products, the variety discounter on Tuesday predicted adjusted underlying profit of £550mn-£600mn for the year to March 26.</p> <p>That is below the levels reported in the past two years, but still ahead of the £342mn posted for 2020, the last year when sales were not inflated by the effects of Covid-19.</p> <p>Same-store sales in the first eight weeks of the new financial year have been 13 per cent below the same period last year, and 11 per cent below two years ago.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/c54d1e3c-737f-4b12-bda8-78dfb34cdca0\">B&amp;M</a> shares were down more than 11 per cent in morning trading in London and have shed more than 30 per cent since the start of the year. </p> <p>RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said store trading was softer than he had expected and that “various headwinds will make it more difficult to grow earnings meaningfully over the next two years”.</p> <p>He also predicted it would be harder for B&amp;M to continue returning cash to shareholders at the rates seen recently. Over the past two years, it has returned over £500mn through special dividends after benefiting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/554984ba-c010-4956-9125-6a7fc6806295\">from heavy spending</a> on household and garden items in particular as B&amp;M stores were permitted to remain open through lockdowns in the UK.</p> <p>The group expects that spending might switch back to more mundane household items such as toiletries and food, which carry lower margins, and that more stock would have to be sold in clearance sales. </p> <p>But outgoing chief executive Simon Arora said he still expected B&amp;M to prosper as a result of the looming squeeze on incomes.</p> <p>“Our main task is to make sure we are 15 per cent cheaper than supermarkets on those key items and we are all over that every day,” he said.</p> <p>He added that previous macroeconomic tests, such as Brexit and the financial crisis, had not derailed the company. “Once people have shopped here they realise that a Barbie doll is a Barbie doll, Duracells are Duracells . . . why would they go back to a retailer that charges more for the same thing?”</p> <p>B&amp;M, which has 700 stores in the UK, said it still had room for another 250. “Our demographic analysis shows 38 per cent of households don't live within 3 miles of one of our stores and we think that's the furthest they'll drive given our small average basket size.”</p> <p>Its business in France, acquired in 2018, posted strong growth in profits after the 107 stores there were converted to the B&amp;M format. </p> <p>The company also announced that finance director Alex Russo, who previously held senior positions at Kingfisher, Asda and Tesco, would succeed Arora as chief this year once a new finance director had been appointed.</p> <p>Arora, who has taken the business from a small collection of stores in north-west England to a FTSE 100 company with £4.6bn of annual sales, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7733b6c-e03d-4b70-bcfc-cd5f50474694\">is retiring this year</a>.</p> <p>Russo said the group's strategy was well defined and would not change. “We've a strong pipeline in the UK and we are executing well. Bobby is staying in the business and we already work very closely together,” he added, referring to Arora's brother who is trading director.</p> <p>Pre-tax profit for the year just ended was £525mn, unchanged from the previous year, on sales that were 2.7 per cent lower at £4.67bn. Adjusted underlying profit was £619mn.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley in London 2022 'B&amp;M profits to fall below pandemic highs' FT.com 31 May.
