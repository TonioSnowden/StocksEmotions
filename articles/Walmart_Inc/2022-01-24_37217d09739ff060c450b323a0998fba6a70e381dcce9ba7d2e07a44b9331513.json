  "text": "<p>Connie Lovell</p><p>Pinehurst, N.C.</p><p>If by \"care\" Mr. Palihapitiya means doing anything to punish the Chinese Communist Party, then he is correct. We still buy Chinese goods at Amazon and Walmart, send our team to the Olympics, watch China-wood movies and wokify our military.</p><p>Brian Brandt</p><p>Lansdale, Pa.</p><p>Thirty years ago, Golden State Warriors guard Sarunas Marciulionis resurrected the Lithuanian national basketball team following a half-century of Soviet oppression. He did so with the financial and in-kind support of Warriors leadership (Donnie Nelson), the corner bank (Bank of America) and a popular local rock band (the Grateful Dead). In the 1992 Olympics, Mr. Marciulionis led Lithuania to a bronze-medal victory over the Russians. The players were celebrated as heroes.</p><p>I encourage Mr. Palihapitiya to brush up on the history of the team he owns.</p><p>Thomas C.
