  "text": "<p>Since then, the benchmark has dropped 22%, closing Monday in a bear market. The conditions driving the skid contrast sharply with those behind the bull run that preceded it.</p><p>Despite this year's slide, eight of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors remain up from the index's prepandemic high on Feb. 19, 2020, as of Monday's close.</p><p>Energy stocks recorded the sharpest declines early in the pandemic, after demand for crude oil cratered. But the sector has gone from worst to first, rising more than 50% since the S&amp;P 500's prepandemic high.</p><p>The technology sector has fallen sharply during the current bear market but is still up 21% from Feb. 19, 2020.</p><p>The communication-services industry is down from its prepandemic level more than any other S&amp;P 500 sector. It includes some of the hottest Covid trades, such as Netflix Inc., whose share price plunged after it reported that it lost subscribers in the first quarter, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., which is down more than 50% this year.</p><p>The market pain spread to retail companies last month after earnings reports from Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. showed rising costs eating into profits. That stoked fears among investors about how some of the country's largest companies will be able to weather the highest inflation rates in decades.</p><p>The Federal Reserve faces the challenge of curbing this rise in prices with a \"soft landing,\" a term used to describe easing high inflation without causing a recession.</p><p>\"Growth has to move down, that's what has to happen for inflation to come down,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"There could be some pain involved to restoring price stability, but we think we can maintain a strong labor market.\"</p><p>The central bank approved a half-percentage-point interest-rate increase in May, the largest since 2000.</p><p>Further evidence of price pressures reported this month could push the Fed to be even more aggressive in its efforts to tame inflation. The Labor Department on Friday said that the consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May from the same month a year ago, the fastest pace of price increases since December 1981. Fed officials will gather in Washington on Tuesday for a two-day policy meeting.</p><p>Peter Santilli and Ming Li contributed to this article.</p><p>Bull Market's Winners Dragged the S&amp;P 500 Into a Bear Market</p>",
