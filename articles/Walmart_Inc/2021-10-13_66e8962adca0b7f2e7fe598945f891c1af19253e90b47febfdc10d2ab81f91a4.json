  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Walmart Is a Convenient  Target for Opioid Lawsuits",
  "text": "<p>   Michael Krauss is right: \"Even Walmart Deserves a Trial\" (op-ed, Oct. 2), although the plaintiffs are engaged in shakedowns and the judge seems biased against the defendants involved in all phases of legal opiate distribution. As a former community pharmacist and state employee who has both dispensed opiates and regulated them, I'm repulsed by this. </p><p>   Abuse of prescribed opioids is not new. I dispensed small, partial prescription amounts of oxycodone-containing Percodan 60 years ago for an addicted judge whose bailiff picked them up. Government shares the blame. In public health, we encouraged \"getting ahead of the pain\" and the inaccurate \"pain as a fifth vital sign.\" Governments routinely ignored the same usage data that is available to distributors, and medical educators failed miserably. But neither they nor the Chinese fentanyl providers can be shaken down by lawyers and governments. </p><p>   Harvey Swenson </p><p>   Sacramento, Calif. </p><p></p>",
