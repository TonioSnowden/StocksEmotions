  "text": "<p>Walmart didn't respond to a request to comment. A CVS spokesman said the company has implemented temporary limits to ensure equitable access, and that it has ample supply in stores and online.</p><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which also had a purchase limit on its website, said the restriction was an error and that it would soon be corrected. A spokesman said the company is investigating the situation.</p><p>The pills are often referred to and sold under the Plan B brand without a prescription. Also called morning-after pills, they are to be taken up to three days after unprotected sex. The medication mainly works by preventing ovulation and, failing that, may stop a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus.</p><p>Plan B pills are different from medication abortion, also known as plan C, which requires a prescription and involves the administration of different pills to terminate a pregnancy. In the U.S., medication abortion has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
