  "title": "El Paso District Attorney Facing Possible Suspension, Removal; The Texas county's top attorney is accused of incompetence and misconduct in the 2019 Walmart mass shooting and other cases, allegations she denies",
  "text": "<p>Yvonne Rosales, a Democrat elected in 2020, faces an extraordinary hearing next month over whether she should be suspended, ahead of a trial next year that could lead to her ouster from office. In addition to claims of inaction on cases, and that she hasn't been responding to subpoenas, her office has been accused of seeking the death penalty against a murder defendant to delay his trial and being involved in manipulating and impersonating family members of a Walmart shooting victim.</p><p>\"It is unclear who is running the office,\" El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal, an elected Democrat, wrote in an amended petition for removal Monday.</p><p>Ms. Rosales didn't respond to requests for comment. She has previously characterized the allegations against her as the work of \"a cabal of power brokers and politicians\" who supported her opponent in her election.</p><p>The 2019 Walmart shooting that Ms. Rosales' office is charged with prosecuting is one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. Patrick Crusius, then 21, is accused of traveling to the border city to target Latinos in the attack, which killed 23. He is also facing federal charges. He has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>During Ms. Rosales' 22 months in office, inaction by her office forced magistrate courts to release more than 320 people arrested for crimes including violent felonies, according to Ms. Bernal's petition. Similarly, Ms. Rosales' office failed to file indictments against hundreds of defendants released on bond, leading to case dismissals and the loss of bond provisions meant to keep victims safe, the petition says.</p><p>In an October response to the effort to remove her, Ms. Rosales argued she has discretion over such cases. \"It is the duty of a District Attorney to see that justice is done, not to rubber stamp every act of a police officer or Grand Jury,\" it said.</p><p>The effort to remove Ms. Rosales began with the prosecution last year of a murder case against Ivan Gabaldon, a then-20-year-old accused of stabbing a 62-year-old man to death. Assistant District Attorney Curtis Cox sought to postpone the trial and, when he was unsuccessful, refiled the case seeking the death penalty. Mr. Gabaldon's attorney, Omar Carmona, said prosecutors sought the death penalty as a delay tactic.</p><p>A judge found the office had sought the death penalty only to punish Mr. Gabaldon for seeking an immediate trial. The judge dismissed the case entirely due to the prosecutors' conduct. Ms. Rosales said the decision to elevate the charge was to seek justice.</p><p>Mr. Carmona then filed a petition to remove Ms. Rosales as district attorney, which Ms. Bernal accepted and set a March trial date. This week, Ms. Bernal followed up with a request to suspend Ms. Rosales immediately.</p><p>\"The allegations and issues raised are too serious and potentially detrimental to the community to allow the status quo to remain,\" Ms. Bernal wrote.</p><p>In her October response, Ms. Rosales argued the petition didn't support any legal finding of incompetence or misconduct. She characterized it as an attempt to overturn a lawful election.</p><p>\"Respondent is a political outsider and a woman who wasn't supposed to win,\" the response said. \"To say that respondent has faced resistance since she was sworn into office is an understatement.\"</p><p>Ms. Bernal declined Tuesday to comment further, citing the pending litigation.</p><p>Three attorneys representing Ms. Rosales in the removal requested to be taken off the case last week. Mr. Cox, the former lead counsel on the Walmart shooting case, recently withdrew from it and resigned from the district attorney's office. He didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Cox's departure follows increasing rancor in the Walmart case, after a pair of mysterious emails purporting to be from the family of shooting victim Alexander Gerhard Hoffman were sent to local journalists in August. The emails attacked the case's judge, Sam Medrano Jr., with whom Ms. Rosales had clashed, and one of her political adversaries.</p><p>An attorney appointed to represent the Hoffman family filed a report as part of the Walmart case in October saying that a lawyer representing Ms. Rosales had sent the emails, and had so intimidated the Hoffman family that they began secretly recording their interactions with him. A court hearing is pending to investigate the matter further.</p><p>Meanwhile, attorneys for the accused shooter in the Walmart case said this month that Ms. Rosales and Mr. Cox have been evading subpoenas regarding the coming hearing. Their team attempted to subpoena Ms. Rosales more than 15 times, according to a court filing, at her home, office and other locations.</p><p>At a procedural hearing last week, none of the prosecutors working on the Walmart shooting case, including Ms. Rosales, was present, which drew a confused reaction from the judge.</p><p>\"Has anybody worked on this case since July 1?\" Judge Medrano asked an attorney dispatched temporarily for the prosecution, who said he did not know. \"It doesn't seem like there's any work that's been done in the last five months.\"</p><p>Write to Elizabeth Findell at elizabeth.findell@wsj.com</p><p>El Paso District Attorney Facing Possible Suspension, Removal</p>",
