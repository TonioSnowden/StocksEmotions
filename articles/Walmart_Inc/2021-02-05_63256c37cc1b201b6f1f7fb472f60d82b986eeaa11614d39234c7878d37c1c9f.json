  "text": "<p>French Connection, the UK fashion brand whose “fcuk” label was a hit in the early 2000s, has been approached by two separate groups of investors, bringing a potential end to a years-long attempt by its founder to sell his stake.</p> <p>The company's board on Friday said it had been approached by retail investment platform Spotlight Brands and Gordon Brothers International as well as brand investor Go Global Retail and HMJ International Services.</p> <p>French Connection said the talks remained at a “very early stage”, adding that it was not certain whether an offer would be made. It did not disclose the terms of any bids, but said any offer was likely to be in cash.</p> <p>The London-based retailer has, like many peers, suffered during the pandemic, as lockdowns have kept non-essential stores closed for months.&#xa0;</p> <p>Online-only brands such as Asos and Boohoo have benefited from their rivals' slump in sales. Both have in recent weeks embarked on<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c81e7266-984f-4c38-8543-83e6449eb79a\"> acquisitions</a>, snapping up brands of former high street icons Debenhams and Topshop, leaving the stores and most employees behind.&#xa0;</p> <p>French Connection's two big shareholders are companies controlled by Stephen Marks, its founder, and Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by billionaire Mike Ashley.</p> <p>Marks has for almost three years been looking to sell his 42 per cent stake, a move that would trigger a mandatory offer for the rest of the shares under UK takeover rules.</p> <p>The company was worth almost £500m at its peak in 2004 before it fell out of favour with younger shoppers. French Connection issued the statement after shares in the London-listed company rallied almost 50 per cent on Thursday to 16.5p, giving it a market capitalisation of £16m.</p> <p>Growing demand for online shopping has punished traditional retailers that have relied heavily on physical stores. The trend has been accelerated by the pandemic, prompting growing interest for takeovers.</p> <p>Strand Equity Partners, an investor in London-based Sweaty Betty, last year launched Spotlight Brands with a view to acquire stakes in up to 20 companies in the consumer industries using a $500m investment.&#xa0;</p> <p>US-based Go Global, a vehicle set up to buy retail brands that was founded in 2016, last year bought online retailer Modcloth from Walmart for an undisclosed sum. </p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson 2021 'French Connection receives two takeover approaches' FT.com 5 February.
