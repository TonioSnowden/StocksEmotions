  "text": "<h2>Rohan Silva: homework helper</h2> <p>Lenders have given a second chance to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29f7a29d-cfd7-34fd-a6ed-96a293f18a0e\">Second Home</a>, the upscale WeWork wannabe founded by former Downing Street policymaker Rohan Silva. Accounts filed this week by Second Home showed the company breached its main debt covenant in March and will probably fail the March 2022 check as well.</p> <p>For the year to December 2019 Second Home reported revenue of £9.8m, largely from membership subscriptions. But administrative fees doubled to £13.2m as Second Home opened new clubs in London and Los Angeles, bringing its total to six. Currency losses, loan interest and depreciation charges raised the total loss to £15.7m which depleted cash reserves to just £5.5m.</p> <p>Since then the company has tapped the UK government's Future Fund coronavirus support scheme for the maximum loan of £5m, which was matched by existing shareholders, and received a waiver from main lender Metro Bank that holds until September 2021. Directors anticipate continued grace over debts but were yet to receive any firm assurances.</p> <p>A covenant breach would allow the bank to recall loans, which Second Home referred to as a “severe but plausible downside scenario”. Directors therefore added a “going concern” warning to the accounts, reflecting the risks that lenders might take a tougher approach to waivers and that Covid disruption might be more severe than anticipated.</p> <p>Second Home's struggles through the pandemic are in contrast to Hubble, an online office space marketplace Silva helped found and chaired until 2016. Hubble last week closed a funding round to raise €2.3m that was backed by “proptech” venture capital fund Pi Labs, an anchor tenant in Second Home's Spitalfields club until 2016 when it defected to rival workspace developer The Collective.</p> <h2>London IPOs: man city</h2> <p>Newly listed companies are among the worst offenders when it comes to promoting gender diversity. A study by law firm RPC found that among newly listed companies on the London Stock Exchange women accounted for just 25 per cent of board members, significantly below the FTSE 100 average of 36 per cent.</p> <p>Companies are at risk of repelling environmental, social and governance focused investors by failing to shake up male-dominated boardrooms in the months and years preceding a float, RPC said. Pressure to change comes from agencies such as PIRC, Europe's biggest proxy voting consultancy, which has been pushing FTSE 350 companies to comply with the government-backed Lord Davies review that sets a quota of at least 33 per cent women on boards. </p> <p>High profile LSE floats including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9dcf0a69-5331-4eaf-87e9-ccee2e4c9463\">Deliveroo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/811dacb5-a2ed-4208-9b93-41522f3b032b\">Wise</a>, the currency transfer specialist, failed the Davies test. They were given a free pass because they sought standard rather than premium LSE listings, which carry no requirement to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code.</p> <h2>MoneyGram: cash and carry</h2> <p>Wise's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5364606a-5275-497b-a985-eb238a890776\">blockbuster float</a> this month has helped revive interest in one of its old economy peers. MoneyGram International, the Nasdaq listed money transfer bureau operator, is rumoured to be in the sights of private equity group Advent. </p> <p>Dallas-based MoneyGram has been treading water since 2018 when the US government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa0b8c6c-9f89-3d34-9e48-cf1edbca022f\">blocked a $1.2bn bid</a> from Ant Financial of China on national security grounds. More recently Covid has stymied the company's walk-in business while main rival Western Union made inroads with Walmart, its biggest agent. </p> <p>Regulatory concerns have been lifting, with the US Department of Justice last month releasing MoneyGram from a deferred prosecution agreement tied to its fraud and money laundering checks that had been imposed eight years earlier. The stock has continued to lag behind rivals in the peer-to-peer payments industry, however, which according to people familiar with the situation has left it vulnerable to an opportunistic buyout offer. </p> <p>The speculation of bid interest has surfaced just as MoneyGram completes a major debt refinancing, which could complete as early as next week. Advent and MoneyGram both declined to comment.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Lenders give pandemic-battered Second Home a second life' FT.com 16 July.
