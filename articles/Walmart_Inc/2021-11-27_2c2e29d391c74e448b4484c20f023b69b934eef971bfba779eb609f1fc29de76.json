  "text": "<p>\"Customers are shopping differently this year,\" said Greg Revelle, Kohl's Corp.'s chief marketing officer. \"We had to alter our Black Friday strategy.\"</p><p>Stores are trying to balance what forecasters predict will be record holiday sales with supply constraints that have kept some items hard to come by.</p><p>Black Friday shoppers spent $5.8 billion in the U.S. online as of noon EST, up about 7% compared with the same time last year, said Salesforce.com Inc., a software company that tracks online shopping. Many consumers were able to save money during the pandemic and are now spending freely despite rising inflation.</p><p>The National Retail Federation expects sales during November and December to rise by a record 8.5% to 10.5% to as much as $859 billion, compared with a year ago. That is in contrast to an average increase of 4.4% over the past five years.</p><p>The forecast was made before the World Health Organization called a new strain of the coronavirus, first detected in southern Africa, a global \"variant of concern.\"</p><p>The trade group predicts that nearly two million more people, or a total of 158.3 million, will shop over Thanksgiving weekend this year, compared with last year. Still, that is down from the 165.3 million people who shopped over the same weekend in 2019, before the pandemic.</p><p>John Rulli, chief administrative officer for mall owner Simon Property Group, said Friday afternoon that foot traffic was exceeding 2019 levels at a number of its shopping centers, particularly in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area and Atlanta. Other areas such as Boston started out a bit slower. \"Overall, we're off to a good start,\" he said.</p><p>As vaccines become widely available and Covid-19-related restrictions are eased, people have been returning to concerts, the movies and traveling. For many, shopping in stores on Black Friday is a social ritual they are eager to resume.</p><p>Last year, Andrew Lubera paused his tradition of shopping in stores on Black Friday.</p><p>This year he waited in the dark outside a Walmart in Catskill, N.Y., aiming to be one of the first inside when the store opened at 5 a.m. to snag toys. \"Last year I didn't shop, but I want to get a few toys, maybe some clothes,\" said the 42-year-old as he waited with a few dozen eager shoppers.</p><p>His wife has already done most of their Christmas shopping online but asked him to head out for a few deals. \"She's still home in bed,\" he said.</p><p>Concerns about out-of-stock items and potential shipping delays as well as Black Friday deals on offer since the beginning of November prompted consumers to shop earlier. Sixty-one percent of people surveyed by the NRF said they had started their holiday shopping before Thanksgiving, up from 51% a decade ago.</p><p>Digital out-of-stock messages are up 261% in November compared with November 2019, according to Adobe Inc., a software company that tracks online shopping. Out-of-stock messages declined slightly on Thanksgiving compared with the previous Thursday, as retailers focused their marketing on in-stock items, Adobe said.</p><p>Shoppers spent $5.1 billion online on Thanksgiving, Adobe said, flat from a year ago, when Thanksgiving Day online spending set a record with many stores closed for the first time.</p><p>Andrew Diaz said he finished more than half of his holiday shopping before Thanksgiving. The 24-year-old said he planned to visit the mall near his Costa Mesa, Calif., home on Friday to purchase the rest of the items on his list. \"I'm worried that if I wait, the stores will be out of stock,\" he said.</p><p>While larger retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. accelerated imports and chartered their own ships to sidestep supply-chain problems, some smaller chains, including Gap Inc., Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. and Urban Outfitters Inc. are scrambling to keep their shelves stocked.</p><p>Delays caused by Covid-19 outbreaks that disrupted production in Asia and a surge of imports for the holiday season created a bottleneck at Southern California ports. On Tuesday, Gap predicted supply-chain disruptions would result in about $550 million to $650 million in lost sales.</p><p>E-commerce sales surged last holiday season, while many nonessential retailers were either temporarily closed or had restricted capacity. This year, online sales for November and December are expected to total $207 billion, a 10% increase over 2020, according to Adobe. That is less than the 32% jump last year, compared with 2019. Some chains, including Best Buy Co. and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., recently reported a slowdown in digital sales.</p><p>Visits to physical stores are picking up, but foot traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels. For the week ended Nov. 20, visits to physical stores were 12.4% below the same week in 2019, according to Sensormatic Solutions, which tracks footsteps with cameras placed at stores. Brian Field, senior director of Sensormatic Solutions' retail consulting practice, said he expects traffic during this year's Black Friday week to fall from 2019 levels, but the drop won't be as steep as 2020.</p><p>Many shoppers still came out for fun.</p><p>\"My grandson wants a VR headset,\" said Normandy Loftin, a 56-year-old pushing an empty cart through the Catskill Walmart Friday soon after the store's 5 a.m. opening. An hour later her cart was piled high with toy cars, scooters and other gifts for her grandchildren. \"Grandma is done with Christmas!\" she said.</p><p>Retailers are giving shoppers less reason to visit stores. The term doorbuster didn't appear in Black Friday advertisements this year at Walmart, Best Buy and other major retailers analyzed by online discount marketplace Brad's Deals.</p><p>Chains including Macy's Inc. and Saks Fifth Avenue held gift-themed streaming events on Black Friday.</p><p>\"People got comfortable communicating through digital platforms during Covid,\" said Emily Essner, Saks' chief marketing officer.</p><p>---</p><p>Sarah Nassauer, Sharon Terlep and Charity L.
