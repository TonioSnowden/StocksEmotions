  "title": "What's Open on Thanksgiving? Target, Walmart and More Are Set to Close; Closures during the Covid-19 pandemic proved popular with customers and employees, some retailers say",
  "text": "<p>Target said Monday it would make the holiday store closures permanent. \"What started as a temporary measure driven by the pandemic is now our new standard,\" Chief Executive Brian Cornell said in a letter to employees.</p><p>Other retailers, like Walmart, say they are using closures this year to show their appreciation to employees for the work they have done during the pandemic and to boost retention in a tight labor market. Many workers will be expected bright and early on Black Friday, with doors opening as early as 5 a.m. at Walmart, Kohl's, Best Buy and others.</p><p>The move is a shift from about a decade ago, when many brick-and-mortars started offering Black Friday deals a day early to compete with Amazon.com Inc. and other digital players. But some soon found it not only stole from Black Friday's thunder, but it generated criticism from customers who didn't like the idea of being encouraged to wheel around shopping carts on a day devoted to giving thanks.</p><p>Here are some of the big chains' plans for Thanksgiving this year:</p><p>Target</p><p>Target said Monday it would permanently keep its 1,915 U.S. stores closed on Thanksgiving, while retaining reduced crews at call and distribution centers. The company already hadannounced store closures for this year's holiday, saying customers and employees had liked the change in 2020.</p><p>\"Thanksgiving store hours are one thing we won't 'get back to' when the pandemic finally subsides,\" Mr. Cornell said Monday.</p><p>Locations will reopen Friday, but hours vary by location.</p><p>Walmart</p><p>Walmart is keeping its more than 5,000 stores closed again this year. \"Closing our stores on Thanksgiving Day is one way we're saying 'thank you' to our teams for their dedication and hard work this year,\" Dacona Smith, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Walmart's U.S. unit, said in June as the company spoke about the move. Most locations will reopen at 5 a.m. Friday.</p><p>Drug stores</p><p>Many CVS Pharmacy locations, including 24-hour sites, will remain open with regular hours on Thanksgiving, a CVS spokesperson said Monday. Some pharmacy hours may be reduced or locations closed for the holiday.</p><p>Most Walgreens stores will also be open with adjusted operating hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Twenty-four-hour Walgreens locations and 24-hour pharmacies will remain open, \"for customers' last minute essential and healthcare needs,\" a company spokesperson said.</p><p>Best Buy</p><p>Best Buy Co. stores will be closed for the holiday, but the company has encouraged customers to shop online or on the app instead that day. The retailer will be open 5 a.m. to 10 p.m on Black Friday.</p><p>Home-improvement stores</p><p>Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. have historically closed for Thanksgiving. Home Depot stores will reopen early on Friday, though hours vary by location. Lowe's will operate regular business hours on Friday.</p><p>Kohl's</p><p>All Kohl's Corp. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. The company said in June that the decision came after receiving a positive response from last year's closure, \"as well as evolving preferences in how and when customers want to shop during the holiday season.\" Locations will open at 5 a.m. Friday.</p><p>Macy's</p><p>Macy's Inc. will be hosting its annual parade, but no one will be shopping in its 516 retail locations on Thanksgiving for the second year in a row, the retailer said in October. Locations will reopen at 6 a.m. the following day.</p><p>Big Lots</p><p>Big Lots Inc. stores will be open, with some early deals on offer. \"We know many of our customers work over the holiday weekend and may appreciate getting an early jump on their holiday shopping,\" President and CEO Bruce Thorn said.</p><p>Simon malls</p><p>The nation's largest shopping-mall operator, Simon Property Group, will close its 168 malls and outlets this Thanksgiving, the company said in October. The locations will reopen for Black Friday. Pre-pandemic, Simon Malls were generally open for several hours on Thanksgiving evening and then on Friday.</p><p>Foot Locker</p><p>Following the decision to close stores on Thanksgiving last year, Foot Locker said it would do the same this year for all North American stores, distribution centers, customer-care units and production facilities, as well as its corporate offices. Foot Locker will reopen for Black Friday at regular store hours, which vary by location.</p><p>Dollar General</p><p>Like last year, most Dollar General outlets will remain open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. for the Thanksgiving holidays, with \"access to a last minute ingredient, over-the-counter medicines or everyday essentials,\" a company spokesperson said. Stores in Maine, Rhode Island and Massachusetts are closed on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>More closures</p><p>Some retailers traditionally stay closed on the holiday, including Costco Wholesale Corp., Walmart's Sam's Club and Recreational Equipment Inc. Costco will reopen at 8 a.m. Friday, Sam's Club will reopen at 10 a.m. REI stores will be closed on Black Friday, as part of its yearslong #OptOutside campaign.</p><p>What's Open on Thanksgiving?
