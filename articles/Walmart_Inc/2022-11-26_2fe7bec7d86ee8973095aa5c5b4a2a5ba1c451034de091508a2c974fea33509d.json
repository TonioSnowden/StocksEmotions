  "text": "<p>\"There's really this massive sense of urgency,\" said Kyle Zebley, director of public policy at the American Telemedicine Association, which is leading the push for the registry. The association and allies including the American Psychiatric Association and Columbia University Irving Medical Center said an end to prescribing controlled substances remotely could cut patients off from critical treatment.</p><p>Cerebral Inc., which is under DEA investigation for possible violations of the Controlled Substances Act, pushed for the registry earlier this year. Rival Done Global Inc. is also under DEA investigation for its prescribing practices and is lobbying for the registry. Cerebral says that in October it stopped prescribing controlled substances other than Suboxone to treat opiate addiction. The Wall Street Journal first reported that some Cerebral and Done clinicians felt pressured to prescribe stimulants to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Walmart Inc. and CVS Health Corp. have said they wouldn't fill controlled substance prescriptions for the companies.</p><p>Done declined to comment. \"We do not lobby and we have not lobbied,\" said Cerebral spokesman Chris Savarese. He didn't respond to a question about the company signing a letter sent in March by the American Telemedicine Association. Cerebral has said that it hasn't been accused of violating laws.</p><p>Rep. Gerry Connolly (D., Va.) wrote in a June letter to the DEA that \"bad actors encourage clinical staff to prescribe dangerous drugs with little oversight from management or qualified staff.\" He said he and other lawmakers want to prevent bad actors from jeopardizing support for legitimate telehealth services.</p><p>The DEA has submitted two potential regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget, federal records show. One would create the registry. The other would allow an opioid-treatment medication, buprenorphine, to be prescribed by phone.</p><p>The White House said it wants opioid users to maintain remote access to prescription anti-addiction medications, some of which are controlled substances. Representatives for the administration didn't say whether telehealth allowances should continue for all controlled substances, including stimulants such as Adderall to treat ADHD.</p>",
