  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>Melvin Capital and Light Street Capital, two US hedge funds hard hit by a rally in stocks popular with retail investors in January, have suffered further losses in May. Get the details <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca1090ba-c3aa-446c-8406-7ce0e01bb510\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Drahi dials up BT Group</h2> <p>It is no wonder that European telecoms companies have started reporting better revenue growth. The number of inbound calls from private equity companies looking for a deal has been booming.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon it was UK telecoms group <strong>BT</strong> that rediscovered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3pFQXlo3jw\">it's good to talk</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Billionaire <strong>Patrick Drahi</strong> was on the blower to tell them that his telecoms acquisition vehicle <strong>Altice</strong> had built <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42756b08-89ff-4639-805d-dc36c255efe7\">a 12.1 per cent stake</a> in the company.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Longtime DD followers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cf6cd60-bc18-11e4-b6ec-00144feab7de\">should know Altice well</a>. They were the private equity-style magicians who promised to work over unloved European telecoms assets by swiftly cutting costs and improving operations.</p> <p>It was a choppy ride as the debt, which fuelled its dealmaking, consumed its promise. Last year Drahi took Altice private and argued that shareholders were undervaluing the business he had built.&#xa0;</p> <p>Altice says it has no intention of making a full bid. A yawning pension deficit and a nationalistic government do make a buyout look unlikely and <strong>Deutsche Telekom</strong>, which also has a 12 per cent stake in BT that was once seen as an acquisition foothold, long gave up those ambitions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Time will tell if Altice has an ulterior motive but the BT move — building a minority stake in a national champion — is a change in style for Drahi. Either way, BT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f98e8629-735f-4bf9-ae80-90475ae8a222\">needs a strong chair</a> to handle its new shareholders, writes the FT's Helen Thomas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Perhaps it's a sign of the times: for all the private equity potential in European telecoms, patience is a virtue.&#xa0;</p> <p>Private equity stalkers <strong>EQT/Stonepeak </strong>and <strong>KKR</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d2ae0cb-8d26-428b-aef9-5bffa0bd66eb\">failed to tempt</a> <strong>KPN</strong>, the Dutch telecoms company, into meaningful talks despite months of teasing their interest.&#xa0;</p> <p>KKR had more success in Spain where it was one of the funds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1bd080-aab2-46ec-870e-0edc65ae4878\">that bought out</a><strong> MasMovil</strong>, but a move to get involved in a <strong>Telecom Italia</strong> network merger plan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44688a20-044f-42f5-87a2-3b053abc6593\">has dragged on</a> and has now become overly complicated.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>TDC</strong> — seen as the first domino in European telecoms <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58ec0614-0fde-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb\">when it was bought by</a> <strong>Macquarie</strong> and some pension funds in 2018 — only on Thursday said that it expected to have finally split the network and service arms of the Danish telco, a key move in creating value, by the end of the year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whatever Drahi's long-term plan, it seems that holding on the line may be the best option.</p> <h2>Meet Amazon's landlord&#xa0;</h2> <p>In 1999, <strong>Hamid Moghadam</strong> bet that the internet would revolutionise the way people bought goods.&#xa0;</p> <p>So the Iranian immigrant and property investor sold all of his retail holdings and poured the money into warehouses.&#xa0;</p> <p>These days, <strong>Prologis</strong>, the real estate investment trust that Moghadam leads, controls nearly 1bn square feet of the warehouse space around the world. Its facilities are the vital nodes of ecommerce for tenants like <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Walmart </strong>and many others.</p> <p>Moghadam's is a great immigrant success story. Now 64, he moved to the US to study at the age of 16 with plans to return to his native Tehran to take over the family business — until the Iranian revolution intervened. He stuck around, and eventually started his own property business.</p> <p>Covid-19 has cast clouds over other big real estate categories, like office towers and shopping malls, but it has proven a boon to ecommerce and so to warehouses.</p> <p>“A whole generation of people that were not consumers of ecommerce — older people — have now seen the convenience and the magic . . . and are not going to go back,” Moghadam <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da94e4f-7e05-429b-ae42-d837b817d4c4\">told the</a> FT's Joshua Chaffin.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now the question is whether he can find new properties with large markets built up, and new entrants crowding the market.&#xa0;</p> <p>Private equity group <strong>Blackstone</strong>, which has bought up $100bn of warehouses, is already making a big play on online retail. <strong>Jonathan Gray</strong>, its president, recently said ecommerce was the “number one theme at the firm”.</p> <h2>A €9.3bn toll road saga finally draws to a close&#xa0;</h2> <p>A convoluted battle involving <strong>Blackstone</strong>, <strong>Chris Hohn</strong>, <strong>Real Madrid</strong> president <strong>Florentino Pérez</strong>, the billionaire <strong>Benneton</strong> family and, at its centre, the Italian government, may finally have reached its conclusion.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's the tale of <strong>Autostrade per l'Italia </strong>(Aspi), Italy's main toll road operator.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD readers may remember that this is the company that managed Genoa's <strong>Morandi Bridge</strong>, which collapsed in 2018 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/874b7e4c-ac3f-11e8-94bd-cba20d67390c\">killing 43 people</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Since then Aspi's owner <strong>Atlantia</strong>, which the Benettons control, has been at loggerheads with the government over its lucrative concession to operate the majority of the country's toll roads.</p> <p>A plan by Italy's <strong>Five Star Movement</strong> to punish the company for the bridge collapse by revoking its concession to operate toll roads did not come to pass, because it would've cost the state billions in compensation.&#xa0;</p> <p>An alternative plan for Aspi's future has now taken shape. On Thursday Atlantia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9513dd8b-0c68-4b50-8a7a-310aa67c417b\">agreed a €9.3bn deal</a> to sell it to a consortium led by Italian state fund <strong>Cassa Depositi e Prestiti</strong> that includes <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Macquarie</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>CDP will own 51 per cent of a new vehicle buying Atlantia's 88 per cent stake. The two funds will each own 24.5 per cent of the entity.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has taken a long time, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2966b0f3-84a8-494a-ad36-620ed2f3896f\">a lot of twists and turns</a>, to get to this point. The latest was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b05185a-9782-403d-bbf6-7fe708006c23\">a potential €10bn rival bid</a> for Aspi from the Spanish construction group <strong>ACS</strong>, run by Pérez. Hohn, whose hedge fund <strong>TCI</strong> holds a 10 per cent interest in Atlantia, was initially supportive of the rival offer.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rival bid has failed to materialise, however, and Hohn has backed the CDP deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>The upshot: a much-coveted asset, with stable long-term returns, is now in the hands of the state fund — and the financiers that decided to back it.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Oil hedge fund manager <strong>Pierre Andurand</strong>'s <strong>Andurand Capital Management</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/feb4f59d-6ccf-4b6a-b6df-5e57f1da4ee7\">hired</a> top environmental analyst <strong>Mark Lewis</strong> to help oversee its new fund.
