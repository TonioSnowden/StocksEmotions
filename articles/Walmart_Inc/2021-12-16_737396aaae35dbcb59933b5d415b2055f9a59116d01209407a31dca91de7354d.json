  "title": "U.S. News: Retail Sales Posted Modest Gain in November",
  "text": "<p>Broadly, consumer demand is strong, and well above last year's levels. Retail sales rose 18.2% in November from a year earlier, showing low unemployment, rising wages and savings from stimulus payments are giving Americans the capacity to spend more this year. That gain well outpaced the 6.8% increase in consumer prices in November from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>But there are barriers to consumers' ability to continue spending at a faster pace than prices are rising. Inflation is at a 39-year high.</p><p>Another factor is that holiday shoppers appeared to have started early this year. October's gain in retail sales was the largest since March.</p><p>\"If you look at the weakness in November sales, it looks more related to holiday shopping,\" said Aditya Bhave, an economist for Bank of America. \"Some of that is going to be a reflection of prices, but the bigger story here is the change in the seasonal pattern,\" with consumers shopping earlier for holiday gifts than in usual years.</p><p>Wednesday's report showed sales at electronics stores down 4.6% in November from the previous month, while sales at general merchandise stores were down 1.2%. Spending at nonstore retailers, including online sellers, was flat last month.</p><p>Stores that sell sporting goods, musical instruments and books saw sales increase by 1.3% in November, the same as the increase at food and beverage stores. Sales at gas stations were up 1.7% last month and are up 52% from a year earlier, in part reflecting higher prices at the pump.</p><p>Higher spending on groceries and gasoline could be limiting sales elsewhere. Inflation can be a \"double-whammy\" for lower-income consumers, who tend to spend a larger percentage of their incomes than higher-income households and tend to spend more on categories with the most price volatility, like food and energy, Mr. Bhave said.</p><p>Since retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation, higher prices contribute to some of the growth. But other factors, like a persistent savings glut for many consumers since the worst of the pandemic, are also fueling growth. That can contribute to a continued cycle of rising prices, given that companies feel confident that customers will be willing to pay them.</p><p>The backlogs that have kept ships anchored offshore for weeks at a time due to pandemic disruptions aren't abating quickly, despite a raft of new federal policies and changes to procedures at major seaports. Though big retailers, like Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., have managed to keep shelves stocked and deliveries flowing, stores run the risk of getting stuck with excess or outdated inventory if goods arrive too late for holiday shopping.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
