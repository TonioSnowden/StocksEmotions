  "text": "<p>Greggs has appointed a new chief executive, with retail and property director Roisin Currie replacing Roger Whiteside, who transformed the baker into the UK's largest on-the-go food retailer during his tenure.</p> <p>Whiteside, who has led the company since 2013 and is due to retire, will step down in May but will support Currie until January 2023.</p> <p>Greggs' share price rose seven-fold during Whiteside's tenure. The company, famous for its sausage rolls, has expanded across the UK and gained popularity for its vegan product line. </p> <p>Currie joined Greggs from Asda in 2010 and will take the helm as the chain navigates continued supply chain disruption, increased labour shortages and inflationary pressures. </p> <p>Whiteside said in Thursday's trading update that the company had already introduced price rises of 5p or 10p on some of its products for the first half of the year and that it would review whether more were needed in the second half. </p> <p>He also warned that staff absence rates had worsened in recent weeks, likening it to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cab74e92-590f-4003-a055-27cb7dd73928\">“pingdemic” of last summer</a>, during which Covid-19 self-isolation rules disrupted many industries. </p> <p>“Labour challenges are back on the increase again. They were at their peak in the ‘pingdemic' and they're on their way back there,” Whiteside said. Seventy of Greggs' 2,181&#xa0;stores are operating with reduced trading hours due to staff absences.</p> <p>Greggs' share price, which surged about 70 per cent in 2021, dropped more than 3 per cent in morning trading. </p> <p>The baker posted £1.2bn in total sales for last year, 5.3 per cent higher than in 2019, helped by the opening of 131 shops over the past year. Like-for-like sales were down 3.3 per cent compared with 2019. </p> <p>The seller of pastries and sandwiches added that its full-year results would be slightly ahead of expectations. Whiteside said: “It's been a hell of a year for our teams and we've ended up getting total sales above pre-Covid levels.” </p> <p>Greggs confirmed plans to open 150 stores this year, focusing on retail parks, train stations, petrol stations and other areas that can be accessed by car.</p> <p>The group said that the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant had proved “challenging” but that a strong performance in October helped it to a 0.8 per cent increase in like-for-like sales when compared with the same quarter in 2019.</p> <p>It will make an additional payout to shareholders of £30m-£40m in 2022, saying it planned to maintain its “progressive dividend policy”.</p> <p>Owen Shirley, a Berenberg analyst, said: “Shareholders will be sad to see [Whiteside] go. He's done an unbelievable job over the last number of years.” </p> <p>But he added that Currie seemed an “excellent” continuity appointment, who would address “shareholders' main anxiety with maintaining culture and performance”. </p> <p>Currie said: “We have created a plan for strong growth and further strategic development of Greggs and I look forward to driving this in the coming years.”</p><p>Source: Ian Johnston 2022 'Greggs appoints Roisin Currie as new chief executive' FT.com 6 January.
