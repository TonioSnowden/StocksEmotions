  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Luxury Brands' Mixed Economic Signals --- Demand for expensive handbags and jewelry is off the charts, despite low consumer confidence",
  "text": "<p>On Friday, the Paris-listed maker of $10,000 Birkin bags said sales in the first half of this year increased 23% compared with the same period of 2021, and operating margins hit a record high. Demand is strong in all regions, even in China, which was under lockdown for several weeks during the second quarter. As soon as stores reopened, shoppers came back and Hermes sales in mainland China grew at a double-digit pace in June.</p><p>Other European names reported similar trends earlier this week. Christian Dior owner LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton said sales increased by 21% year over year in the half. Kering grew by 16%, although its Gucci brand, which generates the lion's share of group profit, looked a bit weak in the U.S.</p><p>Spending by Americans and Europeans is roaring, despite headlines of all-time-low consumer sentiment in the eurozone and greater caution in the U.S. Many luxury brands have more than doubled their sales in America compared with prepandemic levels. And boutiques in Paris and Milan are now full of U.S. tourists taking advantage of the euro's weakness relative to the dollar.</p><p>Because of their wealthier customers, luxury brands might be more immune to the challenges other businesses now face. Walmart recently said shoppers have pared back on clothing, and Amazon.com's results this week showed a slowdown in e-commerce spending.</p><p>U.S. credit-card data from Bank of America does show that shoppers earning less than $50,000 a year, who powered luxury sales in 2021, are rethinking their priorities as food and gasoline prices increase. But this has been more than offset by demand from core luxury spenders.</p><p>Unusually, recent stock-market falls haven't made luxury shoppers cautious. The S&amp;P 500 is off 14% this year, while the S&amp;P China 500 index is down almost a fifth. However, property markets, which have an impact on the wealth effect that drives spending on goods nobody needs, have been resilient. House prices are still close to record highs in the U.S., despite rising interest rates. A mortgage boycott by Chinese home buyers is causing jitters but no crash so far. Chinese households in particular have a large share of their wealth in real estate.</p><p>Investors have been nervous about how long the spending spree can continue, but appear to be reassured by the latest earnings. On Friday, Hermes shares gained 8% in early trading -- an unusually big swing for a stock traditionally seen as a haven. Over the past decade, the stock has closed up more than 5% only a dozen times.</p><p>It is counterintuitive that the ultimate discretionary purchase might be defensive in a downturn. So far, it is hard to find evidence otherwise.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
