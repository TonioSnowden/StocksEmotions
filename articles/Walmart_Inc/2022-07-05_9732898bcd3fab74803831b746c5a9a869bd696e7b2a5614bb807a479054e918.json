  "title": "U.S. News:  Cheney Has Uphill Battle in Wyoming After Tough Talk on Trump  ----  By Natalie Andrews",
  "text": "<p>   WILSON, Wyo. -- Rep. Liz Cheney has cast herself as defending democracy from the impulses of Donald Trump. In the year's most closely watched House primary, fellow Republicans in her home state could punish her for what they see as her disloyalty to the party and the former GOP president. </p><p>   On the national stage, the three-term congresswoman from Wyoming helps lead the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, using her perch as vice chairman to regularly criticize Mr. Trump and GOP politicians who remained aligned with him. </p><p>   \"We must not elect people who are more loyal to themselves or to power than they are to our Constitution,\" Ms. Cheney said to applause on Wednesday at a speech at the Reagan Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, Calif.At a hearing last month in Washington, she told Republicans who repeated the former president's false claims that the election was stolen: \"There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.\" </p><p>   Back in the Cowboy State, Ms. Cheney faces a serious challenge to re-election for Wyoming's sole House seat. Many Republican voters here say they are fiercely loyal to Mr. Trump, and her stance has put her out of step with many constituents headed into the Aug. 16 primary. Mr. Trump took nearly 70% of the state's vote in 2020, his largest percentage win in any state. </p><p>   \"She's kind of a little leech,\" said Verna Thatcher, a 63-year-old from Kemmerer, while picking up supplies at a Walmart. \"Why are we doing Jan. 6? It's been over a year, who cares?\" </p><p>   The race serves as the marquee test of whether vocal anti-Trump lawmakers can survive in today's Republican Party, pitting supporters of the former president against a persistent and unapologetic critic. </p><p>   State Rep. Landon Brown, a Republican who is backing Ms. Cheney for re-election, said she isn't someone to back down on her beliefs. It was \"not a surprise to me at all that she was willing to burn her political capital\" to go after Mr. Trump, he said. </p><p>   In an interview aired Sunday on ABC News, Ms. Cheney said, \"The single most important thing is protecting the nation from Donald Trump, and I think that that matters to us as Americans more than anything else.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing related to Jan. 6, has made defeating Ms. Cheney a priority. He called her a \"RINO and a warmonger\" in a fundraising email Friday, using shorthand for Republicans in Name Only. He has endorsed lawyer Harriet Hageman, campaigning for her at a rally in May. Ms. Hageman has tied herself closely to the former president and is Ms. Cheney's chief rival. </p><p>   Ms. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Mr. Trump for his role in the Capitol riot. He was acquitted in the Senate. Of those, four didn't seek re-election, and one lost his primary. So far, just one, Rep. David Valadao of California, has made it through to the general election. </p><p>   Interviews across the state found many Republican voters backing away from Ms. Cheney. \"I'm thinking, this time, Harriet Hageman,\" said Marge Glick, 79, a retiree in Teton County. \"Liz Cheney, even though she says she's following the Constitution, feels to me like she's moving somewhat to the left.\" </p><p>   Ms. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is now looking to court Republicans living in the state's urban areas such as Cheyenne, Laramie and Casper, as well as persuade Democrats and independents to change party affiliation to vote for her. </p><p>   \"I don't typically vote in the Republican primary but I'm seriously considering changing my affiliation so I can vote for Liz . . . because she's standing up for democracy,\" said Ned Hutchinson, a 54-year-old apparel manufacturer who calls himself a Democrat by nature. </p><p>   Money is one source of strength for Ms. Cheney. As of the first quarter of 2022, she had raised $10.1 million, while Ms. Hageman had pulled in $2.1 million and other opponents had less, according to federal filings. </p><p>   Ms. Cheney's break with the former president has become the central issue in the Wyoming primary. Election fraud is also a point of contention, with Ms. Hageman questioning election integrity but stopping short of Mr. Trump's false claim that the election was stolen. \"What I think that you see in terms of the election integrity issues are what we've seen more on the national level that has a lot of people concerned, including me,\" Ms. Hageman said at a debate on Thursday. </p><p>   \"She knows it wasn't stolen,\" Ms. Cheney said of Ms. Hageman. \"I think that she can't say that it wasn't stolen because she's completely beholden to Donald Trump.\" </p><p>   Spokesmen for Ms. Cheney and Ms. Hageman declined to make the candidates available for interviews. </p><p>   Two polls by allies of Ms. Hageman found Ms. Cheney behind. When Wyomingites were surveyed in early June by a pro-Hageman super PAC, 56% said they would vote for Ms. Hageman, compared with 28% for Ms. Cheney. </p><p>   A May poll by the conservative group Club for Growth, which backs Ms. Hageman, found her leading Ms. Cheney by 30 points. </p><p></p>",
