  "text": "<p>Rivals are trying to accelerate production, but challenges remain in getting supply to the right places. Many retail chains continue to ration supplies by placing strict limits on orders, while others are trying to find substitutes with little success.</p><p>Everyone from frustrated parents to lawmakers on Capitol Hill called for inquiries into why shortages that emerged earlier in the pandemic have been difficult to resolve. A House committee scheduled a hearing on May 25 about the shortage.</p><p>President Biden on Thursday spoke with executives at Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and baby-formula makers about the situation, though a senior administration official declined to provide details.</p><p>The Biden administration pointed to several efforts to address the formula shortage. The Agriculture Department is calling on states to allow recipients of the federally funded program known as WIC to use their benefits for a wider range of products in case the ones they want are out of stock. Mr. Biden asked the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate allegations of price gouging.</p><p>\"This has been more painful from a consumer sentiment because we can't provide solutions,\" said Don Clark, merchandising chief at Giant Eagle Inc. When the grocer had shortages of staples at the start of the pandemic, it had other options. This time, there aren't many formula brands to turn to, he said. The company is evaluating purchase limits and looking to add new products.</p><p>Abbott's Sturgis, Mich., factory paused production in February as food-safety regulators investigated possible contamination of its Similac formula. Abbott issued a voluntary recall. The factory pause left a major dent in production for the industry since it was responsible for making more than half of Abbott's U.S. infant formula, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Rival Enfamil products experienced delays in shipments and transportation earlier in the year as the pandemic continued to disrupt the food supply chains, the person said.</p><p>Abbott and Enfamil owner Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC were responsible for roughly 80% of infant formula sales in the U.S. last year, according to Euromonitor. Nestle SA, which makes Gerber baby-food products, had a nearly 10% market share, while French consumer-goods maker Danone SA had a roughly 1% share.</p><p>The FDA said overall the nation's formula manufacturers are making enough to meet demand without Abbott's main factory online. The industry sold more formula in April than it did in the month before Abbott's recall, the FDA said.</p><p>\"We recognize that many consumers have been unable to access infant formula,\" FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said. \"We are doing everything in our power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when they need it.\"</p><p>The agency is speeding up review processes to allow formula that meets its standards to be imported from other countries and so formula manufacturers can more quickly adjust production lines to give priority to the types of formula produced. Abbott's Michigan plant was among few that produced specialized formulas.</p><p>The FDA said it is trying to figure out if the shortages are the result of not getting enough of the right products to certain regions. And the agency hopes to prevent stockpiling or hoarding by consumers, which it says could also be to blame.</p><p>Infant-formula shortages opened the door for smaller and newer brands to gain traction. But they face regulatory hurdles. Facilities making infant formula require special FDA approvals beyond the usual requirements of food factories.</p><p>The FDA requires new brands to submit detailed explanations of how the formula is developed, studies regarding the nutrients it has to contain, details of quality-control measures and more. The FDA then inspects the facility, observes the process and collects samples for nutrient and microbiological analyses, the agency said. \"Only facilities experienced in and already making essentially complete nutrition products are in the position to produce infant formula products that would not pose significant health risks to consumers,\" the agency said.</p><p>Abbott said it is flying in formula daily from its Ireland factory and has changed over some Ensure nutrition drink factory lines to produce ready-to-drink infant formula.</p><p>\"We know that millions of parents and caregivers around the world count on our formulas to feed their babies and children, and we are doing everything possible to address this situation,\" a spokesman said.</p><p>The Biden administration said the FDA would announce new steps to increase imports of baby formula. The U.S. typically produces 98% of the infant formula purchased by Americans, the White House said.</p><p>Perrigo Co. has two U.S. factories that make infant formula for other brands, such as Bobbie organic formula. It is the only licensed maker that these smaller companies and store brands can use, said Laura Modi, Bobbie co-founder and CEO.</p><p>Perrigo hasn't been able to increase production of Bobbie formula more because it is giving priority to specialty products with a greater need. Two weeks ago, Bobbie stopped taking new orders from consumers on its website to meet the demand from current subscribers.</p><p>Reckitt, the Enfamil maker, said it is running its factories 24/7, having added shifts on Sundays and overtime to ensure staffing around the clock. The company is narrowing production to increase volumes, focusing on sizes it says allows it to provide the most formula.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
