  "text": "<p>Two of the country's biggest retailers, Walmart Inc. and Best Buy Co., warned last week that a steeper-than-expected pullback in shoppers' spending would crimp their profits. The latest financial results also show that many big companies' profits have held up this year by passing along to consumers higher labor and fuel costs.</p><p>Changes in spending habits, so far, have been uneven, companies and economists say. Many people are dining out and traveling more after missing chances to do it earlier in the pandemic. Pent-up demand is also fueling sales for automobiles. And some people -- especially higher-income households -- are continuing to shell out for desired items regardless of elevated prices.</p><p>Consumer confidence, however, has softened. After raising interest rates for the fourth time this year to battle inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that people are going to the grocery store and finding that their budget no longer covers their usual shopping list. On Thursday, the government said the nation's gross domestic product contracted for a second consecutive quarter, raising fears that inflation and a slowdown in inventory building and the housing market are dragging the economy into a recession.</p><p>\"Consumers' budgets are stretched,\" said Sean Connolly, chief executive of Conagra Brands Inc., which makes Slim Jim meat snacks and Healthy Choice meals. \"It forces consumers to be very discerning about what they buy and to find the best overall value.\"</p><p>Unilever PLC, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kraft Heinz Co. are bracing for consumers to cut back or shift to lower-priced or value-oriented products amid economic uncertainty. Each reported lower volumes in their latest quarters, meaning people purchased fewer brand items amid higher prices. Church &amp; Dwight Co., maker of Arm &amp; Hammer branded products, is seeing heightened demand for low-cost laundry detergent, cat litter and other products, CEO Matthew Farrell said.</p><p>Store-branded goods from oatmeal to paper towels gained market share in the four-week period ended July 10 from a year ago, according to market-research firm IRI. Typically, private-label products cost less than brand-name versions.</p><p>Many consumers who weathered the pandemic with the help of government stimulus and fewer expenses of their own are running out of steam. Some now face the return of commuting costs and steeper child-care expenses.</p><p>John Rawlings, 22 years old, and Gabby Smith, 21, recently moved into a new home in Florence, Ky., to be closer to Mr. Rawlings's job at a food manufacturer, in part because his hourlong drive to work became too costly. The couple, with 1- and 2-year-old daughters, said they are going without a couch for now in the new place as they work to keep expenses down.</p><p>\"Sometimes you have to cut back,\" Mr. Rawlings said, pushing a cart packed with store-brand groceries through a Walmart. \"I just had to ask my dad for help with diapers.\"</p><p>The couple estimates they spend about $300 a week on groceries, double from a year ago. Ms. Smith said higher grocery costs were a shock at first, but the couple has begun to adjust. Mr. Rawlings dropped his initial resistance to buying cheaper, private-label alternatives to name-brand products. The children no longer get toys during grocery trips.</p><p>In McKinney, Texas, Walter Jimenez is working three part-time jobs on top of his full-time career as a teacher. He is a single father with a 14-year-old son who plays hockey and a 16-year-old daughter who loves art. \"My son's hockey stick broke, that's $300. My daughter is constantly using up art pads. It adds up,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Jimenez is searching for a new apartment because he was notified last week that the rent on his two-bedroom apartment is increasing to $1,850 a month from $1,300 a month. \"It's really hard to find anything. I'm having to humbly ask if buildings offer teacher discounts,\" he said.</p><p>While people are spending more on groceries, rent and gas, consumers have pulled back on electronics, apparel, housewares and small appliances since March, according to market research firm NPD.</p><p>At Abt Electronics Inc., an 86-year-old Glenview, Ill.-based electronics and appliance retailer, sales have softened compared with earlier in the pandemic when shoppers flocked to buy computers, TVs and other stay-at-home favorites, said Jon Abt, co-president. \"You don't need a new computer every year,\" he said. He said consumers across income levels are still spending on items they need, whether it is furniture or appliances.</p><p>The strains on households appear to be spilling into some services. AT&amp;T Inc. said its customers were taking two days longer on average to pay for their monthly internet and wireless bills. Comcast Corp. failed to add to its ranks of broadband customers for the first time in its history.</p><p>A July survey of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan showed little change from June, when it hit historic lows. Every recession in the survey's 76-year history has been marked by a decline in consumer sentiment, though occasionally a short-lived decline doesn't signal a downturn, survey director Joanne Hsu said.</p><p>\"In general, people are not feeling good about the economy, and they're not expecting things to get a whole lot better in the next year,\" Prof. Hsu said. \"How they're feeling about the economy is very much colored by the fact that things have been not normal for what feels like a very long time.\"</p><p>Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, cautions that consumer and business sentiment are so far gloomier than their actions would suggest. Although some consumers are cutting spending on goods, it is being accompanied by increased spending on services, he said. Hiring has remained strong and core business investment, excluding defense and transportation, has remained steady.</p><p>\"There's all kinds of disconnects in this economy, but there's a very strong disconnect between how people say they feel and how they're behaving,\" he said. \"This gap between sentiment and behavior is the widest I've ever seen.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
