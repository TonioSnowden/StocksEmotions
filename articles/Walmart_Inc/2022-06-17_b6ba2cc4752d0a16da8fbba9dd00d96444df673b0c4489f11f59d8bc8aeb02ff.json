  "text": "<p>\"We are sending a strong signal to pharmacy technicians everywhere that Walmart is serious about attracting top talent and giving them the tools to build a successful career,\" the company said.</p><p>Walmart said it also plans to hire 5,000 new pharmacy technicians this year. Starting pay for pharmacy technicians won't change. It ranges from $15 to more than $22 an hour.</p><p>Pharmacy technicians, who are certified to assist pharmacists in filling prescriptions and can answer customer questions, made $17.66 an hour, or $36,740 a year, on average in 2021, according to the Labor Department. The pay was up 8% from 2019, data show.</p><p>Large retail pharmacies spent much of last year scrambling to adequately staff their locations, as many pharmacies rushed to dole out vaccines, Covid-19 tests and other pandemic services.</p><p>They did so while dealing with Covid-19 outbreaks in their own ranks and a generally tight labor market.</p><p>Earlier this year some Walgreens and CVS pharmacies closed on weekends due to understaffing as the Omicron variant rippled through workplaces.</p><p>Walmart and others aim to expand their healthcare businesses to find new avenues for revenue, which means competition for those workers remains tight.</p><p>Pharmacies including CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. have promised to increase wages to compete for workers.</p><p>CVS said last year that it would raise the minimum average hourly pay to $15 by July. It didn't specify wage levels for technicians. The company has said it plans to spend $600 million to increase worker pay during the next three years.</p><p>On Wednesday, CVS finance chief Shawn Guertin said the company has remained competitive on wages. \"We've done OK,\" Mr. Guertin said at a healthcare industry conference when asked if the company has invested enough in wages to compete. \"And I think it was fortunate that we launched that move before a lot of this took off in full force.\"</p><p>A CVS spokesman said Wednesday that pharmacy technicians have a starting hourly rate above $15, though he didn't say what that rate is.</p><p>Walgreens pharmacy technicians will begin making a minimum $16 an hour this year, up from the current $15-an-hour minimum, the company said Wednesday. New hires also receive a $1,250 signing bonus, paid out in two parts.</p><p>CVS and Walgreens have close to 19,000 U.S. locations combined. Walmart and its warehouse chain Sam's Club have around 5,000 U.S. locations.</p>",
