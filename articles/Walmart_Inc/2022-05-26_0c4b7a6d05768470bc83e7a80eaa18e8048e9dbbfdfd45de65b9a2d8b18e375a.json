  "title": "Stores Cut Telehealth Prescriptions  ----  By Rolfe Winkler and Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   CVS Health Corp. and Walmart Inc. will stop filling prescriptions for controlled substances ordered by clinicians working for Cerebral Inc. and Done Health, the broadest curbs yet by major pharmacies against the telehealth companies following scrutiny of their prescription practices. </p><p>   A CVS spokesman confirmed the change in a statement, citing concerns CVS has with the two companies following a review it conducted. Cerebral had earlier disclosed the change to The Wall Street Journal. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company is taking steps to no longer fill those prescriptions but didn't elaborate on why it made the decision. \"We have an audit and compliance process in place that guides our decisions,\" the spokeswoman sad. </p><p>   Walmart has around 5,000 U.S. pharmacy locations and is the largest retailer by revenue. Last year, Walmart bought a telehealth startup now called Walmart Health Virtual Care. It doesn't prescribe controlled substances, the spokeswoman said. </p><p>   Cerebral called CVS's decision unfortunate, adding that it was \"doing everything possible to ensure these patients get access to medications that their healthcare providers have determined they need.\" Cerebral said it learned of Walmart's decision from the Journal's report and it has reached out to the retailer to understand more about how its decision will impact Cerebral patients and how much time they will have to find alternate pharmacies. </p><p>   The moves come amid scrutiny over how the telehealth companies have used medication to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Federal prosecutors have begun an investigation into the issue and subpoenaed Cerebral earlier this month. The company replaced its chief executive about a week after disclosing the subpoena. </p><p>   Cerebral and Done between them treat tens of thousands of patients for ADHD, prescribing stimulants such as Adderall. Psychiatrists say stimulants can have significant benefits for people properly diagnosed with ADHD. But they are classified as schedule 2 controlled substances by the federal government due to their potential for abuse, the same category as OxyContin and Vicodin. </p><p>   Cerebral and Done grew very quickly from the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting patients with social-media ads that offered an ADHD diagnosis and prescriptions to treat the condition. Previously, clinicians were prohibited from prescribing stimulants without an in-person visit. The U.S. relaxed those rules in March 2020 for all schedule 2 substances due to the pandemic. </p><p>   Fast growth for Cerebral and Done coincided with increasing demand for online health services and for stimulants like Adderall. Prescriptions of the medication dispensed in the U.S. jumped to 41.4 million last year, up 10.4% from 2020, according to Iqvia Holdings Inc., a data and research services provider for the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p>   The Journal reported in March that current and former employees said they felt Cerebral and Done pressured clinicians to prescribe stimulants, and some of them said the companies' initial 30-minute video evaluations often weren't sufficient to properly diagnose ADHD. Cerebral and Done said they don't pressure clinicians to prescribe stimulants and they are providing an essential service in the U.S., where demand for mental-health treatment far outstrips supply. </p><p>   Cerebral said its clinicians can schedule an unlimited number of appointments. Done said systems and software help complete its initial consultations within 30 minutes. </p><p>   Cerebral said this month that its medical group received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York as part of an investigation into possible violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The company said it intended to cooperate with the investigation and that no regulatory or law-enforcement authority had accused it of violating any law. </p><p>   CVS declined to elaborate on the concerns that prompted its change. \"We can't disclose specifics, other than it relates to their policies and practices with regard to controlled substances,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   Some pharmacies had earlier blocked or delayed certain prescriptions from Cerebral and Done prescribers on a more limited basis over concerns that clinicians were writing too many stimulant prescriptions. </p><p>   Walmart told the Journal in April that it had blocked some prescribers affiliated with Done. Individual locations of CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. blocked or delayed prescriptions from Done providers, and some Cerebral clinicians had their prescriptions for controlled substances blocked or delayed, the Journal reported at the time. </p><p>   Cerebral had said prescription delays occurred because of confusion around telehealth policies. Done declined to comment at the time. </p><p>   Cerebral's preferred pharmacy, Truepill Inc., said this month it would stop filling prescriptions for schedule 2 controlled substances such as Adderall. The online pharmacy company said it was taking the move out of \"an abundance of caution\" while it evaluated next steps. Cerebral said at the time that Truepill's action affected less than 2% of its total prescriptions. </p><p>   Last week, Cerebral said it would stop prescribing almost all controlled substances, excluding those used to treat opioid-use disorder. It said the move would take effect for new patients May 20, but not until October for existing patients so they could transition to in-person care or taper off their medication. </p><p>   CVS's decision means that patients relying on the pharmacy chain to fulfill prescriptions from Cerebral will have to find alternatives. The CVS spokesman said patients using Cerebral and Done for controlled-substance prescriptions \"will need to get them filled at another pharmacy.\" Cerebral said it is reaching out to affected patients to help with their transition to another source of prescribed medications. Done didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p></p>",
