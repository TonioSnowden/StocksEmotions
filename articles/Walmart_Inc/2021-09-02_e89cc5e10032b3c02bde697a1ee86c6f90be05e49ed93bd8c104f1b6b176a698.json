Store workers in some regions will continue to be paid $11 an hour, an hourly pay floor Walmart established in 2018.</p><p>Walmart, the country's largest retailer by revenue, has announced a series of wage increases and bonuses for staff in stores and warehouses since last year as competition for hourly workers intensifiesâ€”across a broad section of businesses from restaurants and retailers to amusement parks and warehouses.</p><p>Among retailers, competition is especially fierce ahead of the fall holiday shopping season when most retailers earn a significant percentage of their annual revenue.</p><p>Walgreens-Boots Alliance Inc. said this week it will raise its starting wage for hourly employees to $15 an hour by November 2022. Pay increases will start in October and continue in phases over the next year. The pharmacy chain said the move will cost $450 million over the next three years. Earlier this month, CVS Health Corp. said it would raise its minimum hourly wage to $15 an hour effective July 2022.</p><p>Earlier this week Walmart said it aims to hire 20,000 more warehouse and supply chain workers permanently. The company has also offered special bonus and pay increases to some warehouse workers to keep staff on the job and gave wage increases earlier this year to hourly workers focused on stocking shelves and online sales. Last year the retailer gave wage increases to some managers.</p><p>Competitors such as Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. have also raised wages over the past year. Hourly pay at those retailers starts at $15. Amazon said this week it was seeking to hire about 55,000 people globally among its corporate and technology ranks during a recruiting event set for Sept. 15.</p><p>The Wooing of Workers</p><p>* Walmart Will Add 20,000 Workers to Supply-Chain Operations This Year (Sept. 1)</p><p>* Walmart Gives Special Bonuses and Pay Raises to Keep Warehouse Workers (Aug. 6)</p><p>* This Summer, Jobs Come With a Hefty Signing Bonus (July 1)</p><p>* Tight Labor Market Returns the Upper Hand to American Workers (June 20)</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Gives Raises to More Than 565,000 Store Workers</p>",
