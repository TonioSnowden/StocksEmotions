  "title": "Amazon Hit With California Antitrust Lawsuit",
  "text": "<p>The suit asks the court to block Amazon from continuing those policies and to appoint a monitor to ensure the company's compliance, according to a copy viewed by The Wall Street Journal. It seeks unspecified damages for harm to the state economy and $2,500 for each violation of the state's civil and professional code proved at trial.</p><p>Amazon denied the claims.</p><p>The lawsuit represents the biggest legal challenge to date in the U.S. for Amazon, which was sued by the District of Columbia and is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, the European Union and a congressional committee.</p><p>Because California is the nation's most populous state and biggest economy, its business regulations have long swayed how companies operate across the country.</p><p>Third-party merchants that offer their products on Amazon's marketplace make up the majority of the company's product sales, according to the complaint. California alleges Amazon requires them to sign agreements that penalize them for offering their products at cheaper prices on competing sites such as Walmart or Target. Those who don't comply may get pushed lower in Amazon's search results or be disqualified from being featured in the site's \"buy box,\" the suit alleges, and might even be suspended or removed.</p><p>According to the complaint, Amazon forces wholesalers into agreements that penalize them if Amazon lowers its prices to match those of competitors and its profit margin falls below a specified minimum. In some cases, the complaint says, Amazon demands wholesalers compensate it if competing retailers lower prices on their products.</p><p>The company's dominance in the online retail space leaves third-party sellers and wholesalers with little choice but to agree, the suit alleges. According to Mr. Bonta, a Democrat, Amazon has engaged in illegal practices since at least 2012.</p><p>The complaint says that Amazon misled investigators about its pricing practices, claiming it had changed its behavior, but then engaging in different conduct with the same purpose and effect.</p><p>\"Amazon has stifled its competition for years not by successfully competing, but by blocking competition on price. As a result, California families paid more,\" Mr. Bonta said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"With today's lawsuit, we are sending a message not only to Amazon, but to every corporation in the country.\"</p><p>Amazon countered that in fact sellers determine what prices they offer on its website.</p><p>\"Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively,\" a spokesman said in a statement. \"The relief the AG seeks would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers, oddly going against core objectives of antitrust law.\"</p><p>The spokesman said Amazon hopes a California judge will reach the same conclusion as a Superior Court Judge in the District of Columbia, who in March tossed that case based on Amazon's motion to dismiss. The D.C. attorney general filed a notice of appeal last month.</p><p>Mr. Bonta said California has gathered more evidence than in any previous case brought against Amazon and he was confident his suit would succeed where D.C.'s has not, despite similarities in their allegations.</p><p>\"For one, we are bringing this lawsuit in California court under California law,\" he said. \"We wouldn't bring this case unless we were confident in its likelihood of success on the merits.\"</p><p>He said his office discussed the investigation with Amazon representatives in recent days, but hasn't deposed company executives.</p><p>Jason Boyce, who previously sold sports and home recreational equipment on Amazon for more than a decade and now runs a consultancy for other third-party merchants, said the allegations in California's suit match his experience working with the company.</p><p>\"Sellers have known about this awful practice of Buy Box suppression and price controls for a long time,\" he said.</p><p>In 2020, the Journal reported California began an investigation into the way Amazon treats its third-party sellers. The investigation was opened under then-Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is now the U.S. secretary of health and human services.</p><p>Last year, the Journal reported Connecticut was investigating how Amazon sells and distributes digital books.</p><p>Earlier this year, Democratic and Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland recommending the Justice Department investigate Amazon and some of its executives for what the lawmakers said was possible criminal obstruction of Congress related to a separate investigation into Amazon and other big tech companies.</p><p>Mr. Bonta declined to say whether he discussed California's case with the FTC or attorneys general in other states.</p><p>Congress hasn't passed proposed legislation that would outlaw some of the conduct targeted in the California suit.</p>",
