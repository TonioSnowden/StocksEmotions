  "title": "Man Suspected of Killing Six at Virginia Walmart Was an Employee; Four others are injured and assailant is dead, Chesapeake police said; 'my heart hurts for our associates,' Walmart CEO says",
  "text": "<p>The episode happened during a busy Thanksgiving shopping week at a Walmart Supercenter, a sprawling store that sells everything from groceries to clothes and small appliances, about 5 miles south of Norfolk.</p><p>Police publicly didn't name the shooter on Wednesday morning, saying only he was a current employee and that they had not yet notified his next of kin. But authorities have identified the gunman as Andre Bing, born in 1991, according to two law-enforcement officials familiar with the matter. A SWAT team executed a search warrant at the gunman's home, Chief Solesky said.</p><p>Walmart Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Wednesday on social media that the shooter was a Walmart employee. \"The devastating news of last night's shooting at our Chesapeake, VA store at the hands of one of our associates has hit our Walmart family hard,\" Mr. McMillon said in a post. \"My heart hurts for our associates and the Chesapeake community who have lost or injured loved ones.\"</p><p>In a statement earlier in the day, Walmart said it was working closely with law-enforcement agencies.</p><p>Chief Solesky said the police didn't know the shooter's motive and he didn't believe there was a threat to the public.</p><p>Police also didn't identify the victims and didn't know the conditions of the four injured people who had been taken to local hospitals.</p><p>At Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in nearby Norfolk, there were two patients in critical condition Wednesday morning and one in good condition, the hospital said. Two patients taken there after the shooting had died.</p><p>The shooting was the latest workplace violence episode to turn deadly in recent years. It had echoes of the 2019 shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. A lone gunman, whom authorities said wanted to kill Latino people, fatally shot 22 people in a crowded store and injured 24 others. He didn't work there.</p><p>Last year, an employee at a light-rail facility in San Jose, Calif., and a former employee at a FedEx Corp. facility in Indianapolis each fatally shot workers there.</p><p>In Chesapeake, Chief Solesky said Wednesday morning that police entered the store at 10:16 p.m., four minutes after receiving a call about the shooting, and declared the scene safe around 11:20 p.m. State and federal agencies including the FBI responded to the shooting, police said.</p><p>President Biden said in a statement that he and the first lady are grieving for the families who lost loved ones in the shooting. He also called for gun reform.</p><p>\"Because of yet another horrific and senseless act of violence, there are now even more tables across the country that will have empty seats this Thanksgiving,\" he said.</p><p>Chesapeake Mayor Rick W. West said Chesapeake was a tightknit community that was shaken by the news of the shooting.</p><p>\"I'm devastated by the senseless act of violence that took place last night in our city,\" he said.</p><p>The shooting at the Walmart came as Virginia was still reeling from a mass shooting earlier this month in Charlottesville, about 150 miles northwest of Chesapeake. On Nov. 13, a University of Virginia student was suspected of fatally shooting three football players on the Charlottesville campus and injuring two others.</p><p>Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said on Twitterthat heinous acts of violence have no place in the state's communities. He ordered flags at government buildings to be flown at half-staff until Sunday.</p><p>\"Our hearts break with the community of Chesapeake this morning,\" he said, adding that he had been in contact with law-enforcement officials about the events there.</p><p>Including the shooting at UVA and the Chesapeake Walmart, there have been more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks U.S. shootings. The organization defines a mass shooting as a situation in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.</p><p>Before Tuesday's attack, the latest high-profile mass shooting unfolded in an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. The gunman killed five people and wounded 19 others. He faces murder and hate-crime charges.</p><p>Before the Virginia Walmart shooting and the workplace shootings last year in Indianapolis and San Jose, Calif., there were other massacres involving disgruntled employees.</p><p>In 2019, a factory employee fatally shot five colleagues during a meeting in which he was being fired in Aurora, Ill. Later that year, in Virginia Beach, a city east of Chesapeake, a municipal employee in 2019 killed 12 people in a city building hours after he had been terminated.</p><p>A United Parcel Service driver in San Francisco in 2017 fatally shot three co-workers in at a company warehouse facility.</p><p>â€”Sarah Nassauer, Sadie Gurman and Thomas Derpinghaus contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Man Suspected of Killing Six at Virginia Walmart Was an Employee</p>",
