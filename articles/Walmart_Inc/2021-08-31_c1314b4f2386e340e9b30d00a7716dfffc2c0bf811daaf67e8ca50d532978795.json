  "title": "Why Marta Ortega Pérez Is the Secret to Zara's Success; In a rare interview, Marta Ortega Pérez, daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega, opens up for the first time about the vision behind the brand's global future.",
  "text": "<p>Just a few yards away in this white, open-plan office on the outskirts of La Coruña, a port town in Galicia, Spain's northwesternmost region, is the same kind of chair and desk, used by her father, Amancio Ortega, a reclusive billionaire whose net worth ranks him among the world's wealthiest individuals. Ortega is the founder and controlling shareholder of Inditex, the conglomerate that owns seven clothing companies, including Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Zara. In recent decades, Zara has blazed into 96 countries, where some of its 1,854 stores sit on premium boulevards near luxe brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Chanel. But while a cropped, tailored tweed jacket from Chanel might be $8,550, one with similar vim from Zara sells for around $120.</p><p>In keeping with Zara's egalitarian vision of how the world can dress up, Ortega—or \"The Boss,\" as he's called at home and at work—has never bothered with an office. Rather than isolating himself in a hushed corporate tower on the campus he built as Inditex's headquarters, Ortega prefers to sit on the floor of Zara's women's department. At 85, and technically retired from an executive role, he still comes to work nearly every day but has always kept a low profile: He's never given an interview and avoids events and public photographs. (Ortega is now chairman of Pontegadea, a holding company that has diversified his assets in recent years, and of a self-named charitable foundation.)</p><p>Ortega Pérez, 37, started working at Zara 14 years ago, when she took a job as a sales associate in London's King's Road store after graduating from university. \"The first week, I thought I was not going to survive,\" she says. \"But then you get kind of addicted to the store. Some people never want to leave. It's the heart of the company.\" She now visits Zara stores almost weekly, as part of an expansive, somewhat open-ended role (she does not have an official title) in which she mostly helps to oversee womenswear designs and merchandising as well as managing the brand's image. \"I will always be wherever the company needs me most,\" she says.</p><p>\"[Marta is] very humble. But at the same time, of course, she has strong opinions about many different things,\" says Inditex chairman Pablo Isla, who stepped into that position in 2011 when Ortega retired. Isla says that he anticipates her role to become more significant as the company increasingly focuses on sustainability over the next decade. Ortega Pérez, meanwhile, says she has no plans to take on a formal leadership role. \"You never know your future, and I'm open to it. But to be honest, I would like to stay close to the product. I think that's what my father always did.\"</p><p>Zara's famously well-honed system for apparel manufacturing includes nine factories and nine distribution centers in Spain, plus another distribution center in the Netherlands, as well as around 2,000 vendors and suppliers across locations in Morocco, Turkey, India and China. Its supply chain is set in motion by the company's reaction to customers' desires—part of a long-held strategy to keep inventory low and design timelines short. International high-street competitors such as H&amp;M, Topshop and Aritzia struggle to match its breadth of product and depth of reach. Zara sells more than 450 million items per year of womenswear alone, and new items arrive twice a week at Zara stores and online, including a dizzying carousel of bags, shoes, lingerie, menswear and children's clothing, home goods, perfume and Zara's recently launched bridal wear and cosmetics lines. A luxury-world counterpart, such as Giorgio Armani, which offers a similarly wide array of categories under the Armani Group umbrella, had a consolidated net revenue of $1.9 billion in 2020. Zara's consolidated net revenue for the same year was $16.7 billion.</p><p>\"I think it's important to build bridges between high fashion and high street, between the past and the present, between technology and fashion, between art and functionality,\" says Ortega Pérez. As someone who embodies the extremes of the fashion industry, she is helping Zara batter down the traditionally unquestioned divide between luxury fashion and mass apparel. A fashion client herself, she is a regular at Valentino Couture shows, a fangirl who delights in the artistry, craft and wit of designer friends like Valentino's Pierpaolo Piccioli, Narciso Rodriguez and the late Alber Elbaz. She also grew up under the watchful eyes of her maternal grandmother, an enterprising woman who supported her eight children by working as a seamstress and a cleaner.</p><p>\"Not only a few people should be able to have access to high quality. We want all our customers to be able to [have that],\" says Ortega Pérez, who in 2018 oversaw the introduction of Zara's limited-edition, high-style SRPLS line: biannual collections of utilitarian and streetwear-inspired pieces for men, women and children in cotton, wool, linen and silk, priced up to $250, with most items under $100. Ortega Pérez attended a presentation in Paris, acting as an ambassador for both Zara and her hometown, doling out invites to La Coruña and chatting about its local charms.</p><p>Fabien Baron, an independent creative director who has counted Dior, Calvin Klein, Burberry and Louis Vuitton as clients, admits that when Ortega Pérez attended a Zara team meeting in 2017 at his offices in New York, \"I didn't even know who she was. I just thought she was someone who worked at Zara,\" he says, laughing. He came to appreciate her unassuming approach as he helped develop Zara's new cosmetics line and worked on brand campaigns with top fashion photographers such as Steven Meisel. \"[Marta] is like the undercurrent voice of the brand,\" says Baron. \"She brings a layer of sophistication to Zara that maybe Zara didn't have before…. Her father built a business, and [Marta] is building a community that will help the company go to another level.\"</p><p>In recent years, Ortega Pérez had arranged for Piccioli and Elbaz to visit La Coruña, where they spoke to the design staff. Within two months of Elbaz's death in April 2021, Ortega Pérez had produced a linen-bound memorial book that included an essay she wrote, along with tributes by fashion journalists and photographs of Elbaz at work. Folded around the book is a poster of one of Elbaz's drawings, on which he wrote: \"The biggest revolution of Zara is to bring, introduce, create, the dreams to the world. We love you. Alber.\"</p><p>A slender blonde with a modish blunt bob, her mother's bright smile and her father's owlish eyes and thick brows, Ortega Pérez wasn't fully aware that her parents ran a fashion empire when she was growing up in La Coruña—she knew just that her parents worked in fashion and traveled a great deal. Tamara Sanchez, a former ballet classmate who now heads Zara's knitwear department, recently reminded her that she'd once asked why Ortega Pérez wore Zara every day. Unaware that was the case, Ortega Pérez shrugged and said, \"Oh, really? Is that the brand? My mom buys me everything.\"</p><p>These days, Ortega Pérez dresses with pragmatic chic, typically opting for draped pieces from Zara, flat Celine sandals, soft leather Hermès bags and exquisitely casual diamonds from Marie Lichtenberg. Home is a duplex in La Coruña that she shares with her husband, Carlos Torretta, a former modeling agency executive from Madrid; their 1-year-old daughter, Matilda; and her 8-year-old son, Amancio (from Ortega Pérez's first marriage to professional equestrian Sergio Álvarez Moya). To her chagrin, she is something of a celebrity in Spain, with magazines like ¡Hola! running paparazzi photos of the family, though, she notes with relief, in La Coruña she walks the streets in peace.</p><p>Besides SRPLS, Ortega Pérez works closely with women's designer Beatriz Padin on Zara's Studio collection, which showcases high-end design within the larger Zara ready-to-wear line. (There are three other lines: Woman; TRF, aimed at younger, trend-driven shoppers; and Basic, which features classic staples.) Several times in conversation, she emphasizes Zara's nonhierarchical structure, which in practice creates the peculiar dynamic of Ortega Pérez showing deference to staff members who are ostensibly her employees. \"This is not about one person doing a good job. We're a team,\" she says. \"I think [my father] was never the best at anything in particular, but he was the best at finding the best person to do each thing.</p><p>Amancio Ortega began working for a local shirtmaker at 13 to supplement income from his father's railroad job. La Coruña, where locals often speak the Galician language, Gallego, juts into the Atlantic Ocean; it has long had a thriving fishing industry as well as something of a textile trade. By 1963, Ortega, then 27, launched his own textile business, and soon enough his own clothing business with his then-wife, the late Rosalia Mera, selling cozy, quilted robes to ward off the chilly Atlantic fog. The local housewives snapped them up, along with the fashionable lingerie Mera designed. In 1975, they opened Zara, which they originally named Zorba. Realizing that a nearby bar already had the same name, and with the letters for the sign already in production, Ortega and Mera played around until they came up with Zara. (Their other daughter, Sandra, and son, Marcos, are not actively involved in Inditex.)</p><p>Today, Inditex employs 5,500 people in La Coruña, many of them locals, others international arrivals. Nearly all of Zara's inventory flows through the distribution centers in and around La Coruña, per Ortega's belief in unifying the stock management system. \"I think [remaining in La Coruña] has been part of the success of the company, as perhaps it gives us a different perspective, instead of being in the thick of it elsewhere,\" says Ortega Pérez.</p><p>Every morning after dropping off her son at school, Ortega Pérez gathers with the company's CFO, Miguel Díaz, and other top staff around an industrial table out on the open floor to review global rankings for such bestselling pieces as a minimalist black spaghetti-strap summer dress, or a rococo printed pajama-style blouse with matching shorts. Orders heading to stores are constantly adjusted, an anomaly in an industry that typically plans merchandise drops well in advance. (Zara's operations are supported by an in-house technology product team that uses Netflix as a measuring stick for both consumer-facing and back-of-house innovations, including a mock fulfillment center floor set up to study the movements of a box-moving robot.)</p><p>Roughly 140 patternmakers and a hundred seamstresses work at the La Coruña headquarters to help turn the various design teams' ideas into reality. Each piece ultimately gets a fitting on a model, an unusual practice at the mass-fashion level. Zara's efficiency and flexibility in executing production means that it can plan its fall/winter collections in mid-June, reacting to trends and demand three months faster than companies that require the traditional six months' lead time (some items are created in as little as six weeks, others are planned months out). On a recent visit, Ortega Pérez visited the fashion team to review \"fantasy\" winter coats in rich, ornate fabrics as well as lamé and sequined dresses that anticipate a return to nightlife when they begin to hit stores later this month.</p><p>Ortega Pérez is one of the company leaders who encourage Zara's design teams to take leaps of faith on what are termed \"emotional\" novelty pieces. These might include an impractical, intricately beaded teal sheer robe-dress with elaborate (and costlier) embellishments, which turned out to be a huge June seller. Zara's immense scale and long-held relationships with suppliers allow it to purchase more-expensive fabrics for less. Brands at a similar price point—Banana Republic or Club Monaco—tend to be more risk-averse, while mass retailers like Target and Walmart, whose size means they must plan far in advance, are unlikely to feature such fashion-forward styles.</p><p>This is why walking into a Zara feels more like entering a department store with diverse offerings than a brand with a single aesthetic—a strategy that reduces the risk that you'll walk out because, say, you encounter a sea of neutrals that aren't your look. Instead, each sleek Zara rack hosts a trove of fresh, vivid styles—a kaleidoscope of constantly changing fashions. Inevitably, accusations of copying abound. Given the industry's penchant for wringing inspiration from vintage clothing, cultural motifs, streetwear, Instagram trends and often each other—and in the absence of strong intellectual property laws protecting design—such suits are hard to win. In 2011, Christian Louboutin alleged that Zara's use of red shoe soles, which Louboutin considered a signature brand motif, constituted trademark infringement. Louboutin lost the suit and a subsequent appeal in French court.</p><p>\"We try to look for the best quality, the best design. We respect people's work,\" says Ortega Pérez, who points out that over 50 percent of the company is dedicated to design in some capacity. \"I think we have our own identity. And we have been developing new products from scratch for a long time.\"</p><p>Zara's identity is based, in part, on its imagery, which Ortega Pérez focuses on closely. The brand is notable for forgoing print advertising and instead relying on its stores and social media for marketing. Zara is also known for its practice of buying marquee properties in luxury retail areas, an unusual tactic among its competitors, who typically lease less expensive spaces. In a similarly ambitious strategy, the brand's photo shoots are comparable in tone and pedigree to those of a high-end designer like Miuccia Prada—and often use the same top models and photographers.</p><p>Ortega Pérez first fell in love with the image-making process when she was a teenager and visited the Barcelona set of a Zara shoot featuring Kate Moss. At the time, she was a serious equestrian competing at the Grand Prix show-jumping level, spending many weekends away from her Swiss boarding school—her father allowed her to continue to compete as long as she kept up her grades—and later running from her Zara day job to training and horse shows. But she knew that being a professional rider was not for her. The pull of the family business was too strong. Her mother, Flora Pérez, was a longtime Zara design staffer, and several of Pérez's family members, including a younger brother, Óscar Pérez Marcote, work alongside Ortega Pérez.</p><p>In recent years, Ortega Pérez has collaborated with Meisel, who shoots images for a biannual Zara campaign (and who was commissioned by WSJ. Magazine to take her portrait for this article), as well as other well-known photographers, including David Sims, Craig McDean and Zoë Ghertner. The late Peter Lindbergh became a sort of mentor friend (and took photos of her 2018 wedding to Torretta). Torretta works alongside his wife in what the company calls \"online communications,\" keeping his desk in a cavernous on-site studio where on any given day multiple shoots with top editorial models, such as Edita Vilkeviciute and Rebecca Longendyke, might be underway for the brand's site and social media feeds.</p><p>Despite its seemingly insatiable appetite for marketing imagery, the brand allows the creative talents it hires a great deal of latitude. \"Zara is a commercial company that sells at a certain price point, but…they weren't, like, 'We need to sell this garment,'\" says photographer Mario Sorrenti, who started working with Zara in 2016. \"Usually you have a great idea and you want to do something really spectacular but you don't have the budget—they were not only open to great ideas but also to making those things happen.\"Sorrenti and Ortega Pérez have become friends. \"It feels like you are working with a family,\" he says. \"It's a family brand.\"</p><p>In Lindbergh's honor, Ortega Pérez recently organized a tribute collection, with unisex T-shirts in black and white that feature some of his most famous photographs, curated by Baron. Proceeds are being donated to the Franca Sozzani Fund for Preventive Genomics, founded in memory of the late Italian Vogue editor, who was a longtime friend of Lindbergh's. An exhibition of Lindbergh's work in La Coruña is in the works.</p><p>\"Obviously we're a big company, but I feel like it's not so big—I don't know anything about the big figures. We don't even want to talk about them. In our daily [work] it's not something we are worried about,\" she says. \"It's big, but it's smaller.\"</p><p>This reminds her of a lesson she learned from her late friend Elbaz, which he in turn had learned from his mother. \"Be big at work and small in life,\" his mother had told him. Ortega Pérez says, \"It's one of the best things I have ever heard.\"</p><p>Why Marta Ortega Pérez Is the Secret to Zara's Success</p>",
