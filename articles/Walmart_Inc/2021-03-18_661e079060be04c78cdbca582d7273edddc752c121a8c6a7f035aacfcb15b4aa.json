  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  It makes sense to recruit comrades in arms to fight a giant like Amazon. But powerful new friends can't completely paper over old worries about Japan's Rakuten. </p><p>\n  The Japanese e-commerce company raised the equivalent of $2.1 billion on Friday from selling new shares to Japan Post, China's Tencent and Walmart. Rakuten Chairman Hiroshi Mikitani and his family will chip in $92 million as well. </p><p>\n  The alliance makes sense: Each of the partners offers something unique to aid in Rakuten's battle to fend off Amazon. The U.S. e-commerce company has been gaining market share from Rakuten and has been the No. 1 online retailer in Japan since 2016, according to Euromonitor International. SoftBank-backed Z Holdings, which merged with messaging company Line this year, is catching up fast. Line is Japan's most popular messaging app, which provides a large user base for Z's e-commerce business under Yahoo Japan. </p><p>\n  Japan Post's chain of 24,000 post offices and its delivery network will strengthen logistics for Rakuten's e-commerce business. Tencent could share its expertise in digital payments while providing a channel for Japanese merchants in China. Since 2018, Rakuten teamed up with supermarket chain Seiyu, which used to be fully owned by Walmart, in online groceries. The U.S. retailer sold most of its Seiyu stake to KKR this year. It kept a 15% stake while Rakuten owns 20%. Japan Post, which owns a bank and an insurer, and Tencent might help Rakuten's fintech business, which accounts for around a third of its revenue. </p><p>\n  Investors love the move: Rakuten's shares rocketed more than 20% since reports on the deal Friday. </p><p>\n  While the business logic is sound, the biggest worry remains what has been weighing on shares for a while, which is Rakuten's foray into the mobile business. Until the recent jump, Rakuten stock had essentially been flat for years: a notable, and not a positive, distinction in the bubbly market of recent years. </p><p>\n  And all of the money raised Friday will be put into the build-out of its mobile network. Rakuten faces an uphill battle: Japan's telecom market is already dominated by three big players, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has long pushed for lower mobile fees. Japan Post may be happy to provide capital and cheap locations for base stations, but making money as a carrier may still not be easy for Rakuten. The company swung to a negative operating income last year as mobile losses stacked up. </p><p>\n  Rakuten has made all the right friends, but it still has to tackle its mobile distraction if it really wants to slay its giant American rival in the Japanese market. </p><p></p>",
