  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>Democracy can be a messy business, as several events coming up this week will show.</p> <p>There has been much excitement in the British media about the publication of the partygate report by senior civil servant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f055c842-b819-4811-bcd0-4dd53e0589fe\">Sue Gray</a> into how prime minister Boris Johnson and members of his government broke lockdown rules. It could be published on Monday, but it's more likely to be Tuesday or Wednesday. However, when it does appear we may all have to curb our enthusiasm. </p> <p>The details are likely to be uncomfortable (to say the least) for Johnson, but received wisdom is that he will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fe9b264-29b9-4c9a-b701-207d6b2b3f26\">cling on in office</a> because his Conservative MPs do not have a plan B. </p> <p>Perhaps those with most to worry about are the civil servants, who Gray is likely to name, resulting in disciplinary action. The most senior of these, Cabinet secretary Simon Case, has already reportedly been assessing his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/340d7036-45fc-4e20-a780-224ab34ee715\">options outside Westminster</a>. It would be somewhat ironic if the main casualties of partygate were the unelected officials carrying out the nefarious requests of elected politicians.</p> <p>This week's election watch (should I make this a new permanent section?) is Colombia's presidential contest this Sunday, most likely to be won by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b91ef3e6-6969-40de-84db-26e220ddf18a\">leftwing former anti-US guerrilla fighter</a>, Gustavo Petro.</p> <p>If you want to learn more, our man in Latin America, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/michael-stott\">Michael Stott</a>, had first-hand experience of being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c19472f7-d4b0-4df7-a7bf-dc8db3e109dc\">stopped and searched</a> by soldiers looking for M-19 guerrillas back in the 1980s, when he was teaching English to university students as part of his degree course. Petro's only serious political rival appears to be Federico Gutiérrez, the former mayor of Medellín, who has emerged as the main “stop Petro” candidate.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10030865.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Colombia is a breathtakingly beautiful country — just ask <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fca6c79-4d1d-4fc6-9f68-a4d6a4de3ecf\">Unhedged writer Rob Armstrong</a> — but a victory for Petro is concerning to politicians in Washington, who view Colombia as its most important strategic alliance in South America. </p> <p>A Petro administration is likely to rethink some key tenets of the US-Colombia relationship, such as the war on drugs, a free trade deal and a US-led push to unseat the revolutionary socialist government in next-door Venezuela. The country is on edge amid rumours of a possible military coup or an election postponement.</p> <p>While we are diarising, you might want to note down the next significant South American election: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4397c849-ee0d-4d4f-becc-6d51ec46d78f\">Brazil in October</a>.</p> <p>What are you looking out for this week? I'm interested. Email me at <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.moules@ft.com\">jonathan.moules@ft.com</a></p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>The US, France and Germany all report first-quarter gross domestic product estimates this week. </p> <p>There will also be a chance for international comparisons from the S&amp;P Global purchasing managers' index data, out on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, US markets will digest the publication of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from its May meeting.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>The end to another earnings season is approaching so company reports are relatively thin this week. Retail is a theme as is the utility industry in the UK. <strong>Twitter</strong> is among those holding their annual general meetings this week — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fd36ef6-b29f-45a3-91ed-172459110879\">should be lively</a>.</p> <p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> chief executive Steve Rowe will be checking out after 39 years with the British retailer when he presents the company's full-year results on Wednesday. </p> <p>Over the past year M&amp;S has surprised on the upside, twice increasing its profit forecasts. However, those upgrades along with the change of chief executive are already baked into the share price, so all eyes will be on the outlook for the current year.</p> <p>Rivals such as Next and Primark have already telegraphed price increases to offset the impact of rising commodity and other costs — and that was before US titans Walmart and Target sent the sector into a tailspin last week with their own warnings. </p> <p>That does not bode well for dividends. M&amp;S has not paid one since January 2020 and had already indicated a resumption of payouts was “unlikely” this year.</p> <p>Meat processing business <strong>Cranwick</strong> is expected to report healthier profits on Tuesday owing to cost-cutting measures. However, investors will want to know how the UK company is addressing the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15e37385-dff9-497f-9a1e-5e3090428b7b\">challenges in the pig farming industry</a> from labour shortages to the impact of the Ukraine war on feed prices.</p> <h1>Key economic and company reports</h1> <p>Here is a more complete list of what to expect in terms of company reports and economic data this week.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, European Central Bank publishes eurozone investment fund statistics</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, monthly IfA business confidence index</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Kingfisher</strong> Q1 trading update, <strong>Zoom</strong> Q1</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Eurozone, France, Germany, UK, US: S&amp;P Global flash composite (manufacturing and services) purchasing managers' index (PMI) data</p></li>  <li><p>UK, CBI quarterly distributive trades survey plus April public finances and public sector net borrowing data</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Best Buy</strong> Q1, <strong>Cranswick</strong> FY, <strong>Homeserve</strong> FY, <strong>Ralph Lauren</strong> Q4</p></li> </ul> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>EU, ECB publishes its twice-yearly stability review plus OECD publishes economic outlook for the eurozone</p></li>  <li><p>France, consumer confidence figures</p></li>  <li><p>Germany, final Q1 GDP figures plus GfK consumer confidence survey</p></li>  <li><p>New Zealand, Reserve Bank of New Zealand's monetary policy statement</p></li>  <li><p>Switzerland, ECB president Christine Lagarde, Ireland's taoiseach Micheál Martin, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and the president of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola join a Davos forum on the EU's unity in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Twitter</strong> AGM</p></li>  <li><p>US, Federal Open Market Committee releases minutes of its May meeting</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Hollywood Bowl</strong> 1H, <strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> FY, <strong>Nvidia</strong> Q1, <strong>Pets At Home</strong> FY, <strong>Severn Trent</strong> FY, <strong>SSE</strong> FY</p></li> </ul> <h2>Thursday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Canada, March retail trade figures</p></li>  <li><p>UK, CBI quarterly service sector survey plus official figures for the number of 16-24-year-olds not in education, employment or training (Neet).</p></li>  <li><p>US, Q1 GDP figures (second estimate) and Q1 consumer spending data</p></li>  <li><p>Results: <strong>Alibaba</strong> FY, <strong>Baidu</strong> Q1, <strong>Dell Technologies</strong> Q1, <strong>Intermediate Capital Group</strong> FY, <strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> FY, <strong>Macy's</strong> Q1, <strong>Ted Baker</strong> FY, <strong>United Utilities</strong> FY</p></li> </ul> <h2>Friday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>France, Q1 preliminary employment figures plus final Q1 GDP figures</p></li>  <li><p>US, April personal income and spending data</p></li> </ul> <h1>World events</h1> <p>Finally, here is a rundown of other events and milestones this week. </p> <h2>Monday</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Austria, Germany: the <a href=\"https://www.egu22.eu/\">European Geoscience Union 2022</a> begins its annual general assembly in Vienna plus in Bonn the European Space Agency holds its Living Planet Symposium, described as the largest earth observation conference in the world</p></li>  <li><p>EU, the eurogroup of 19 finance ministers from member states that adopted the single currency meet in Brussels ahead of the Ecofin council meeting of all EU finance ministers.

Meanwhile, a ballot for strike action over jobs and pay involving thousands of workers with some of the UK's biggest train operators and Network Rail will close.
