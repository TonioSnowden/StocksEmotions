  "text": "<p>That's the message from Trader Joe's, which is telling customers that it is recalling some frozen chicken products for containing bone fragments.&#xa0;</p><p>A company chicken provider, Innovative Solutions, Inc., based out of Kent, Wash. is recalling 97,887 pounds of raw chicken patty products sold at the popular grocery store that were produced between Aug. 16 and Sept. 29, 2021 after customers complained about finding bone pieces in their chicken burgers.&#xa0;</p><p>The “Chili Lime Chicken Burgers” and the “Spinach Feta Chicken Sliders” are the subjects of the recall.&#xa0;Specifically, shoppers should check their freezers for the the 1-pound cardboard packages featuring four pieces of the “Trader Joe's Chili Lime Chicken Burgers” with lot codes 2281, 2291, 2311, 2351, 2361, 2371, 2441, 2511, 2521, 2531, 2561, 2591, 2601, 2671 or 2721 on the label.&#xa0;And also look out for the 9-pound bulk-pack boxes packed with 72 pieces of the “Spinach Feta Chicken Sliders” with lot codes 2361 or 2631 on the label.&#xa0;</p><p>If you've got these in your home, the the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)&#xa0;urges you not to eat them. They should be thrown away, or returned to the place of purchase.&#xa0;</p><p>Consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via&#xa0;Ask USDA&#xa0;from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. Shoppers can also browse food safety messages at&#xa0;Ask USDA&#xa0;or send a question via email to&#xa0;MPHotline@usda.gov.</p><p>It's just the latest kitchen purge that Americans have been urged to make. In October, health officials linked a salmonella outbreak across 37 states to whole red, yellow and white onions that were imported from Mexico. The CDC advised shoppers to check to see if their onions were imported from Chihuahua, Mexico, and distributed by ProSource. And if the onions didn't have any packaging showing where they were from, the CDC said those onions should be tossed, and any surfaces they might have come into contact with cleaned well.</p><p>And in August, at least 130 pet deaths were potentially liked to Midwestern Pet Foods.</p><p>Recent product recalls have also included Tesla TSLA recalling more than 11,700 vehicles due to software glitch that can activate emergency brake, as well as approximately 3.3 million Boppy Newborn Loungers that were sold nationwide at retailers including Amazon AMZN, Target TGT, Walmart WMT and Pottery Barn Kids.&#xa0;</p>",
