  "text": "<p>In 2021, Target breached the threshold of $100 billion in annual revenue, having grown 47% since Chief Executive Brian Cornell unveiled his investment strategy five years ago. Its market capitalization tripled over that time. After its investor-day presentation on Tuesday, shares closed almost 10% higher.</p><p>That was despite a holiday season that was slightly less cheerful than analysts expected. For the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, comparable sales grew 8.9% from a year earlier, trailing analysts' expectations of 10.2%. It still looks impressive relative to peers. Walmart saw comparable sales in the U.S. grow 5.6%.</p><p>So far, Target's traffic-driving strategy -- ranging from Ulta Beauty shops within stores, a larger grocery footprint and private-label brands with different price points -- seems to be paying off. In the stores where Target added Ulta Beauty, the company is logging a midteens percentage increase across total beauty category sales, the company said Tuesday. Own-brand sales grew 18% in 2021 and, at $30 billion, its private-label business is larger than Macy's annual revenue. Target seems to have no shortage of ideas for driving traffic: It tested out ear-piercing services for some Minneapolis stores to great fanfare and has since rolled it out to 200 stores.</p><p>Given Target's impressive run over the past two years, its forecast for further gains was a surprise. The retailer raised long-term revenue growth guidance to a mid-single-digit percentage from low single-digits. Of course it won't come free: Target plans $4 billion to $5 billion in capital expenditures every year, which would represent more than 40% growth from last year. The question is whether Target's capital investments -- in adding new locations, remodeling and fulfillment centers -- will continue yielding impressive growth. Costco, which reached its $100 billion annual sales milestone in 2013, saw its comparable sales growth rate decline in the three years that followed.</p><p>Shareholders have reason to be pleased about profitability: Return on invested capital was 23.5% and 33.1% in 2020 and 2021, respectively, reaching twice what it was in the years before the pandemic. Its bar is now even higher: Target expects annual ROIC to be 20% to 30% going forward, up from its prior expectations of 10%-plus.</p><p>Target has a great record of hitting the bull's-eye, but the dart board just moved back a couple of feet.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
