  "text": "<p>The apology comes after social-media users posted images of Walmart's Juneteenth products in its stores, including the Great Value brand of Celebration Edition Juneteenth Ice Cream. Cartons of the red velvet cheesecake-flavored ice cream featured the red, yellow and green of the Pan-African flag and included the words \"Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation, and enduring hope.\"</p><p>The company has a wider range of products in its stores commemorating the holiday, including decorations, clothing and books.</p><p>Some people said Walmart selling certain products trivialized the June 19 holiday marking the end of slavery in the U.S.</p>",
