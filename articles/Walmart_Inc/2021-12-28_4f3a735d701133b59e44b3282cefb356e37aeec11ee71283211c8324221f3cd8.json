  "title": "Biden considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as top banking regulator at Fed",
  "text": "<p>The administration is eyeing Raskin, a former Fed governor and former Treasury Department official, to become the central bank's vice chairwoman of supervision, the government's most influential overseer of the American banking system, the people said.</p><p>Biden is also considering two economists for other Fed board seats that will soon be vacant: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University; and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina.</p><p>Raskin's nomination could mollify progressive Democrats, some of whom opposed Biden's decision in November to&#xa0;offer a second term to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a Republican first chosen for the top job by former President Trump. They have called for the Fed to take a tougher stance in regulating big banks and a bolder approach in addressing financial risks posed by climate change.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has signaled to the White House she would support either Raskin or Richard Cordray, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's first confirmed director, who&#xa0;also has been under consideration&#xa0;for the Fed's banking-regulator post.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>Trending at WSJ.com:</p><p>Walmart sparks public outcry in China over goods from Xinjiang</p><p>Botox shot or COVID booster? The combo causes some seasonal wrinkles.</p>",
