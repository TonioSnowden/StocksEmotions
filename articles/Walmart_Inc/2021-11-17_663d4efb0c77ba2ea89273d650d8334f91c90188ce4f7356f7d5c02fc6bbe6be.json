  "title": "Luggage Brand Away Names Melissa Weiss as Its CMO; She joins as the direct-to-consumer travel brand is on a C-suite hiring spree and as the travel industry revives following the worst of the pandemic",
  "text": "<p>\"After an extraordinarily challenging period for the travel industry, we have been capitalizing on growing customer demand and seeing significant gains across all categories,\" said Jen Rubio, co-founder and chief executive officer of Away, in a statement.</p><p>Ms. Weiss will oversee brand marketing, growth marketing, creative and communications functions, the company said. She worked most recently as a consultant and prior to that as head of marketing at Lyft Micromobility. She also previously held the post of chief marketing officer of Barry's Bootcamp, and earlier held senior roles at J.Crew and Amazon Fashion.</p><p>She succeeds Selena Kalvaria, who began a new role as senior vice president, brand engagement at Gucci Americas earlier this year.</p><p>Mr. Chatelain was most recently chief digital officer of J. Crew, and Mr. Liu previously held senior roles at Casper and Walmart.</p><p>Away launched its first product in 2016, with a carry-on suitcase that it sold directly to consumers through digital channels. It has since expanded into various luggage and travel-related products, and added bricks-and-mortar retail stores to complement its online sales.</p><p>In 2019, the company raised $100 million at a $1.4 billion valuation. The following year, the Covid-19 pandemic grounded travelers around the world, bringing the entire industry to a halt. In a Medium post in April 2020, Ms. Rubio and Away Co-founder Steph Korey announced the company would lay off 10% of its staff and furlough about half its team.</p><p>Now, travel brands are reassessing their marketing and overall business strategies amid rising demand for travel as restrictions from the pandemic abate. The company has since grown its team and reopened its retail locations.</p><p>Away is focused on raising awareness, deepening community engagement and adding customers, Ms. Rubio said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"As we look to 2022 and beyond, we've set aggressive growth targets for the business, which include a significant emphasis on our brand strategy,\" she said.</p><p>During the pandemic, the company continued to promote its brand, including a creative campaign that made reference to the rash of pandemic pet adoptions, a tongue-in-cheek direct-mail catalogue highlighting at-home uses for travel accessories and partnerships with Serena Williams and fashion designer Sandy Liang, said Ms. Rubio. The company also struck partnerships with brands like Marriott and fashion brand Kith, it said.</p><p>Last month, Away began rolling out its holiday campaign online and in its retail stores, the company said.</p><p>Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com</p><p>Luggage Brand Away Names Melissa Weiss as Its CMO</p>",
