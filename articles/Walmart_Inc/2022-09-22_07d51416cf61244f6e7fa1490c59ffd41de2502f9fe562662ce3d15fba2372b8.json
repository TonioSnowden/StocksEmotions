  "title": "FedEx to Raise Shipping Rates by 6.9% as It Combats Slowdown; Delivery giant says it plans to eliminate another $4 billion in annual costs",
  "text": "<p>The plans were announced Thursday as part of FedEx's first-quarter earnings report, which also revealed additional plans to slash costs. The company said it expects to generate between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion in savings this fiscal year from a plan announced last week to park aircraft, suspend Sunday deliveries and close some offices. It also plans to wring an additional $4 billion in annual costs from its operations.</p><p>FedEx Chief Executive Raj Subramaniam, who took over from founder Fred Smith on June 1, is also likely to face questions about how early initiatives to make its delivery networks more efficient have fared. Activist investor D.E. Shaw has pushed FedEx to boost profits, and Mr. Subramaniam, who previously served as FedEx's operations chief, has pledged to make the operating structure more efficient and increase profit margins.</p><p>FedEx customers and industry observers are looking for details about the company's next cost-cutting moves and whether they will affect shipping prices and services ahead of its peak delivery season, a period that starts around Thanksgiving and ends in mid-January. The company has roughly 547,000 full- and part-time employees and about 6,000 contractors with its FedEx Ground delivery business.</p><p>Delivery companies, including FedEx, UPS, the U.S. Postal Service and Amazon.com Inc., are slated to handle about 92 million parcels a day in the time frame that corresponds with the holiday-shopping season, but they have the capacity to handle about 110 million parcels, said Satish Jindel, president of research firm SJ Consulting Group.</p><p>Carriers scrambledto increase package-handling capacity in earlier months of the pandemic as businesses dealt with a jump in online purchases. A pullback in online orders occurred faster than carriers and many retailers expected. Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. sounded alarms this spring that their stores and warehouses were holding too much inventory after they stepped up orders to avoid supply-chain delays at the same time that demand slowed rapidly.</p><p>FedEx Express, the company's biggest unit by revenue, flies time-critical packages overnight for customers. The spending slowdown and order reductions meant customers didn't need to pay as frequently for fast air-shipping. FedEx Express revenue in the August quarter was about $500 million lower than it planned, the company said.</p><p>\"I think the problem is with the market, not FedEx, in that people had unreasonably high expectations at how sustainable and how sticky the pandemic gains were,\" said Ravi Shanker, a transportation-industry analyst at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>The prospects of package carriers having excess capacity could limit the pricing power that they wield and enable shippers to ask for lower rates. Jack King, a denim-apparel maker in Bristol, Tenn., said his firm, L.C. King Manufacturing, used to ship solely with FedEx Ground because the delivery giant helped his company diversify from being solely a wholesaler to becoming an e-commerce retailer too. \"It brought us to the dance,\" Mr. King said.</p><p>But the increases in fuel and peak delivery surcharges were too much for his daily operations of shipping more than 100 packages. Stamps.com, a partner of both USPS and UPS, helped his company save $4.50 per package, according to Mr. King. \"We were stunned by how much cheaper it was,\" he said. </p><p>CEO Raj Subramaniam is contending with the challenge of boosting productivity while cutting costs at FedEx.

Ahead of the peak season, carriers typically hire thousands of people to handle higher parcel volumes, bringing on more drivers and extending hours in their sortation facilities. Last year, FedEx said it planned to add 90,000 seasonal workers.</p><p>The delivery giant may have limited flexibility in reducing its costs on drivers in the months ahead. FedEx Ground contractors have been asking for more compensation to help with higher fuel and wages since the start of this year. Ground contractors are typically small businesses that hire their own drivers and buy their own trucks to deliver packages on their allocated routes. Amazon earlier this month said it would raise pay and introduce some new benefits for its drivers.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Can FedEx survive this economic slowdown? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Some investors have called for the company to consolidate its Ground and Express businesses into one unit, a move that Mr. Smith, who now serves as executive chairman, had long resisted. Each FedEx unit operates as an independent business with its own CEO.</p><p>Company executives have said they plan to integrate some operations between Express and Ground that provide overlapping service, but said that there are limitations. Certain Ground facilities, for instance, aren't equipped to handle air cargo. Ground also relies on independent contractors, while Express owns the planes it uses and directly employs its staff.</p><p>â€”Cara Lombardo contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com</p><p>FedEx to Raise Shipping Rates by 6.9% as It Combats Slowdown</p>",
