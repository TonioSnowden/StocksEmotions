  "text": "<p>J Sainsbury raised its profit outlook after first-quarter sales beat expectations, with Britain's second-biggest grocer saying it was ignoring the takeover speculation sweeping the sector to remain focused on delivery.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales excluding fuel rose 1.6 per cent in the 16 weeks to June 26, easily beating consensus forecasts for a decline of 1.7 per cent. Versus the pre-pandemic quarter sales were up 9.9 per cent as grocery, clothing and general merchandise all expanded.</p> <p>Sainsbury targeted a full-year underlying pre-tax profit of at least £660m, up from £356m in the previous year and slightly higher than a £630m consensus expectation.</p> <p>Shares in Sainsbury have jumped 23 per cent in the year to date after private equity groups targeted rivals Asda and Wm Morrison. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Ocado</strong> revealed it had signed a deal to develop Alcampo's online business in Spain, with an initial target of building a warehouse to serve the Madrid region from 2024. The agreement will cover both Alcampo's food and non-food business, with the grocer using Ocado's in-store fulfilment software across its hypermarkets nationwide to enable more efficient picking from stores, it said. Interim results from Ocado covering the period to May showed group revenue up 21.4 per cent to £1.3bn and a pre-tax loss of £23.6m, narrowing from £40.6m the year before.</p> <p><strong>Purplebricks</strong> said it was launching a new simplified pricing structure with money-back guarantees and a target of delivering medium-term annual revenue growth in excess of 20 per cent. For the year ended April the estate agent posted an £8.2m operating profit on revenue from continuing operations up 13 per cent to £90.9m, versus last year's operating loss of £5.7m. Recent trading suggests current year ebitda will hold steady, in line with market expectations, Purplebricks added.</p> <p><strong>Bridgepoint</strong> confirmed plans to float on the London Stock Exchange. The mid-market buyout fund targeted raising gross proceeds of approximately £300m to support growth and repay debt.</p> <p>Handbag maker <strong>Mulberry</strong>&#xa0;said it had agreed to terminate the lease of its flagship Paris store on Rue Saint Honoré and exit the property early for an after-tax saving of £10.8m. Mulberry said it would reopen in Paris once international tourism returns. </p> <p>Software maker <strong>Alfa Financial</strong> said revenue has remained strong since its last update in May. Based on recent contract wins and additional customer work for the second half, revenues for the full year are expected to be around 5 per cent above previous guidance, it said. </p> <p><strong>Assura</strong>, the hospital and healthcare property investor, said development activity is at record levels. The company said in a first-quarter trading update that its estate of 610 properties had an annualised rent roll of £123.5m.</p> <p>Educational equipment supplier <strong>RM</strong> said revenue in the six months to May grew 21 per cent to £96.1m, matching 2019 levels, and adjusted operating profit nearly doubled to £8.2m.</p> <p><strong>Argo Blockchain</strong>, the cryptocurrency miner, said it is exploring a potential secondary listing on&#xa0;Nasdaq. </p> <p><strong>LGIM</strong>, the UK's largest asset manager, has warned that firms must not be allowed to acquire Morrisons&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-9d1a6019-6571-478c-8b1f-f267bb582f0d/qyLjTW2rUcl7EMz3tuT6wA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRixmhdP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvOWQxYTYwMTktNjU3MS00NzhjLThiMWYtZjI2N2JiNTgyZjBkP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBlM2Q4ODEwYmU5MjIwMDA0MzI3ZDdmJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpg3Ynj42DxC34WUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">for the “wrong reasons”</a>, such as profiting from the supermarket chain's property portfolio or “levering the company up with debt”.</p> <p><strong>KKR</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5cc18cf-081d-4b68-b469-ca77935a615e\">expanding its operations</a> to target more takeovers in the UK, as the record-breaking pursuit of British companies by private equity firms reignites a debate over the role of the buyout industry in the economy.
