  "text": "<p>Later on Wednesday, Del Rio apologized for his phrasing about calling the event a \"dust-up at the Capitol\" but did not walk back other aspects of his original comments.</p><p>\"I made comments earlier today in referencing the attack that took place on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. Referencing that situation as a dust-up was irresponsible and negligent and I am sorry,\" Del Rio said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"I stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. I say that while also expressing my support as an American citizen for peaceful protest in our country. I have fully supported all peaceful protests in America.</p><p>Del Rio's comments Wednesday morning about the events of Jan. 6 were captured on video in a viral tweet.</p><p>The Commanders play their home games in Washington, D.C.</p><p>See also: PGA Tour suspends Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and other players who joined LIV golf</p><p>His post drew more than 2,100 comments and led his name to trend on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon. Critics noted that the difference is that most of the protests against police brutality following Floyd's murder were peaceful and bringing attention to racial inequality, while the violent storming of the Capitol was intended to obstruct Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.</p><p>Several elected Democrats and and Republicans in leadership have also lamented the events of Jan. 6. President Joe Biden called the attack \"unprecedented assault\" on democracy. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the event a \"dark day for Congress and our country\" on the one-year anniversary of the mob storming the Capitol. And around the same time, fellow Republican Ted Cruz referred to Jan. 6, 2021 as \"a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice has called the Jan. 6, 2021 incident an \"attack on the Capitol,\" and more than 840 defendants have been arrested in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia related to the obstruction of Congress. The attack caused approximately $1.5 million worth of damage, according to a May 2021 estimate from the Architect of the Capitol. But the DOJ puts the approximate losses suffered as a result of the Capitol siege at $2,734,783 as of April 5, 2022.</p><p>A list of defendants charged in federal court in Washington D.C. related to crimes committed at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 can be found here.</p><p>Also read: Walmart heir Rob Walton to buy Denver Broncos for a record-setting $4.6 billion</p><p>Washington Commanders cornerback Kendall Fuller said he was not aware of Del Rio's tweet.
