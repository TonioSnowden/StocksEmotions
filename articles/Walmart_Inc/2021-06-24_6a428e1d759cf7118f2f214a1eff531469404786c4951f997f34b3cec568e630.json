  "text": "<p>In your <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e95ad9f5-d9b9-49ec-a71e-8650da5e7ff2\">June 21 editorial</a> you write that if companies such as Amazon use predatory pricing to drive rivals out of business “consumers suffer”. While this might be a great theme for an academic paper, it is irrational to apply it to Amazon. Jeff Bezos created large-scale online shopping but didn't drive online rivals out of business because there were none. So what are Lina Khan and her EU counterparts really about? Walmart survived similar envy and I hope Amazon will as well.</p> <p><strong>Phillip Hawley</strong> <br><em>La Jolla, CA, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Shoppers adore Amazon' FT.com 24 June.
