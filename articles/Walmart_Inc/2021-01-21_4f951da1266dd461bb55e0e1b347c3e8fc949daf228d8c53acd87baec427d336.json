  "title": "Business News: Tyson to Settle Further Price-Fixing Claims --- Poultry-buyer groups to get $221.5 million; individual complaints remain unresolved",
  "text": "<p>Tyson said it reached the settlement with plaintiffs including direct purchasers, commercial and institutional indirect purchasers and end-user consumers. Last week, Tyson notified a court that it had reached a deal with the direct poultry buyers without disclosing the amount.</p><p>It didn't admit any liability as part of the settlements. Tyson said \"it believes that the settlements were in the best interests of the company and its shareholders in order to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.\"</p><p>The settlement announced Wednesday, which is subject to court approval, doesn't cover lawsuits filed separately by individual plaintiffs. Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride Corp. and other U.S. chicken suppliers still face suits from some of their top customers, including chicken-sandwich company Chick-fil-A Inc., supermarket operators Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co., and food-service distributors Sysco Corp. and US Foods Holding Corp.</p><p>Pilgrim's, the second-largest U.S. poultry processor by sales, last week said it agreed to pay $75 million to settle some price-fixing claims. On Wednesday, Tyson said it would book the $221.5 million settlement with the plaintiff classes in its first-quarter financial results.</p><p>Antitrust pressure has grown on the U.S. meat industry, which is dominated by a handful of major meatpackers after decades of consolidation. The Justice Department last year subpoenaed major beef processors, seeking information on their buying practices.</p>",
