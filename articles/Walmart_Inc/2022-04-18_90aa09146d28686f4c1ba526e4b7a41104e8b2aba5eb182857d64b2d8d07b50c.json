  "text": "<p>Who could bear to kill and eat a feathered friend called Princess Layer or Margaret Hatcher? Hobby farmers who name their chickens are unlikely to save any cash. But they could make some money for Tractor Supply. The Tennessee-based company bills itself as a “rural lifestyle retailer”. It caters to recreational smallholders and leisure gardeners, as well as professional ranchers and growers.</p> <p>Tractor Supply is doing brisk business. Hobby farming exploded in popularity during the pandemic. Many Americans aspire to produce more of their own food and to spend more time outdoors. Their motivations tend to be personal as much as economic. </p> <p>Tractor Supply doubled sales to a record $12.7bn last year. Net income, at just under $1bn, is also more than twice the figure five years ago. At a time when brick-and-mortar retailers are closing stores, Tractor Supply, which also owns the pet supply chain Petsense, has been expanding. It has 2,181 stores and aims to open another 90 this year. </p> <p>One-third of Tractor Supply's sales are from its own private labels. A specialised focus and merchandise mix have helped shield it from online competitors. You cannot easily buy 40lb bales of chopped hay on Amazon. Its annual Chick Days are also a popular draw that cannot be replicated online. Here, Tractor Supply brings in live chicks and ducklings from hatcheries to its stores for purchase for a few weeks each spring. </p> <p>Investors have taken note. Shares in Tractor Supply are up 160 per cent over the past two years, outpacing the gains on the S&amp;P 500. That has given the business a market valuation of more than $26bn. At 24 times forward earnings, Tractor Supply trades at a premium to much bigger retailers, such as Walmart and Home Depot.</p> <p>Tractor Supply can retain its superior rating by growing its customer base of hobby farmers and gardeners. Food prices are rising steeply, alongside interest in food provenance. Sceptics say the waning of the pandemic will hurt Tractor Supply. But they are just chickens.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
