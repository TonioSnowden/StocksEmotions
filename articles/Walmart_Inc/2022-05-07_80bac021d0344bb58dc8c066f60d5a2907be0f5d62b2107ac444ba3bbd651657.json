  "text": "<p>   Western ports are bracing for increased congestion when China eventually lifts stringent Covid-19 restrictions in major cities, which could come just as many importers start to load up for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. </p><p>   Import gateways such as California's Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, which handle more than a third of all containers coming into the U.S., are still inundated with uncollected cargo more than two years into the pandemic. </p><p>   Once full export shipments resume in ports including Shanghai, which moves more than a quarter of all containers heading to Europe and the U.S., some officials say importers could face more delays in the arrival and handling of their cargoes, as well as higher delivery costs. Recent lockdowns in cities across China have weighed on factory activity, which in April fell to the lowest level since the early days of the Covid outbreak. </p><p>   \"I can't say whether we will go back to a 100 ships queuing up to dock, but we really need to get the existing cargo out of the port and out of Southern California,\" said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. </p><p>   Some U.S. companies are warning that lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere in China are denting sales, disrupting operations and putting added strain on supply chains that could be felt well into the summer. </p><p>   The peak season for liner ships usually starts in late August and ends in November. Liner executives say this year's season is starting earlier, with several American importers renting cargo space on ships for deliveries in early June. Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and thousands of other importers of furniture, toys, homeware and electronics have sought to move up shipments to avert delays and have enough inventory for the back-to-school and year-end holiday buying seasons. </p><p>   Some shipping executives are skeptical that boxships from China will deluge U.S. and European ports. The Port of Shanghai didn't close during the pandemic, but export volumes have fallen by as much as 30% since March, according to the Freightos Baltic Index. Inventory levels are already elevated for a range of companies that are trying to avert shortages or delayed deliveries. </p><p>   \"Shanghai has not had a big impact yet, but congestion is still a big issue,\" said Soren Skou, chief executive of Denmark's boxship giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S. </p><p>   Mr. Skou said boxes at East Coast ports are piling up as cargo owners fear the West Coast will stay congested. He said warehouses in Shanghai are operating at 20% to 50% capacity, cargo at European ports is moving slowly and about 10% to 12% of the global container fleet remains stuck at ports. </p><p>   Mr. Seroka of the Los Angeles port said fallout from China's lockdowns has been limited so far. As of late last week, 39 ships were waiting to anchor outside Los Angeles and Long Beach, compared with more than 100 earlier in the year. </p><p></p>",
