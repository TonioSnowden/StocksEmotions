  "text": "<p>    Beyond Meat Inc., the plant-based food company struggling with a sales decline, is launching a steak substitute. </p><p>   The steak product will be available at Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. grocery stores as well as Albertsons Cos. and other retailers. </p><p>   El Segundo, Calif.-based Beyond Meat sells meatless products, such as burgers and meatballs, in grocery stores and to restaurants. </p><p>   Beyond Meat reduced its revenue outlook for the year and announced layoffs of about 20% of its workforce in October, citing lower demand for its products and the effects of competition on the company's sales. </p><p>   It also recently parted ways with top executives including Doug Ramsey, its former chief operating officer, who was arrested in Arkansas in late September for allegedly biting a man's nose and threatening to kill him. </p><p>   Its stock price has dropped by more than 80% in the past year. </p><p></p>",
