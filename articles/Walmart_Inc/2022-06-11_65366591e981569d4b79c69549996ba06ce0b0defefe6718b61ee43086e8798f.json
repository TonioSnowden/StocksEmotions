  "text": "<p>Rows of London taxis, a faux grenadier band, red telephone boxes, oil money. You guessed it, this is Saudi Britain. I was at the private <strong>Centurion Club</strong> just north of London for this week's inaugural <strong>LIV Golf</strong> Invitational, a competition bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's <strong>Public Investment Fund</strong>. <strong>Phil Mickelson</strong>, who once described the Saudis as “scary motherfuckers” only to join LIV anyway, walked right by me on the way to the opening tee to cheers from his fans. </p> <p>LIV chief executive <strong>Greg Norman</strong>, former world number one, declined to be interviewed. PIF representatives were helpless to prevent the narrative being dominated by accusations that Saudi Arabia is “sportswashing” its reputation. At press events, golfers struggled to answer questions about human rights abuse and the murder of dissident journalist <strong>Jamal Khashoggi</strong> inside one of the kingdom's embassies. But with more star players joining the $2bn initiative, even some of LIV's opponents privately fear the plan is working. Golf's establishment, led by the US <strong>PGA Tour</strong>, is on watch. <br><br>Separately, we dig deeper into the $4.65bn Denver Broncos sale, and we step into <strong>Paolo Maldini</strong>'s garden to give you a fly-on-the-wall account of the former <strong>AC Milan</strong> defender's critical role in the sale of the Italian football club. Do read on —<em> Samuel Agini, sports business reporter</em></p> <h1>Saudi Arabia's $2bn rebel tour sparks golf establishment into action</h1> <p>Make no mistake, Saudi Arabia's <strong>LIV Golf </strong>is shaking up the ancient sport. </p> <p>LIV chief executive <strong>Greg Norman</strong>, who was known as “the Shark” in his playing days, offers an alternative to the US <strong>PGA Tour</strong>, the dominant force in a game that was once banned by James II, King of Scots, lest it distract from archery.</p> <p>Recruiting <strong>Phil Mickelson </strong>and <strong>Dustin Johnson</strong>, who've both reached the top of the world golf rankings, for reported sums of $200mn and $150mn, was a warning of LIV's potential. More star players are set to follow.</p> <p>On the first day of LIV's invitational outside London, PGA Tour commissioner <strong>Jay Monahan </strong>suspended Mickelson, Johnson and 15 other members playing at LIV. The PGA Tour pointed out that golfers sign up to its rules when they choose to become members.</p> <p>Norman, who tried to set up a rival tour while still an active player, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a770c525-7241-4ee4-8db2-5b0f7c4cd568\">contends</a> that golfers are independent contractors who should have the right to play anywhere they please. </p> <p>But the involvement of Saudi's <strong>Public Investment Fund</strong>, which has set aside at least $2bn for LIV, suggests other motives are at play. The sovereign wealth fund's investments are meant to reduce the Saudi economy's reliance on oil and achieve crown prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan to modernise the conservative kingdom.</p> <p>But relations with much of the world have come under strain since the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents. As a US presidential candidate, Joe Biden promised to treat the kingdom as a “pariah”, while the country remains hostile to lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender people. </p> <p>As a result, PIF's expansion into sport has been controversial. Its critics argue that investments such as state oil company <strong>Aramco</strong>'s sponsorship of <strong>Formula One</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed0d401a-ff9b-4199-9f5f-7a2a3e5727ca\">£305mn acquisition</a> of <strong>Newcastle United </strong>football club, and <strong>LIV </strong>are a ploy to “sportswash” Saudi Arabia's reputation, change perceptions around the world and exert soft power.</p> <p>Streamed live on <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>YouTube</strong>, LIV's first event commanded attention across the golf and mainstream news. Media flocked to the Centurion Club to cover the event. Golfers looked uncomfortable as they faced questions about the ethics of taking Saudi cash.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bc48b6-0c8c-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67\">Whatever the motives</a>, and there are several, Saudi petrodollars are upending the established order in golf. LIV's battle with the PGA Tour is only just getting started.</p> <p>As LIV's slogan goes, it's “Golf but louder”.</p> <h1>What the $4.65bn Denver Broncos sale means for the NFL — and all of sport</h1> <p>It's been an incredibly busy three weeks for major sports club acquisitions, all with huge valuations. </p> <p>First came the forced sale of <strong>Chelsea FC</strong>, on May 25, for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7257acdb-d96d-491c-8e68-82e11d8e424d\">a Premier League record </a>£2.5bn; less than a week later <strong>RedBird Capital Partners</strong> bought <strong>AC Milan</strong> for €1.2bn, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15c9f437-8eb9-4d83-85ec-af36079243b8\">the most ever for a continental European club</a>. And on Wednesday, <strong>Walmart</strong> heir <strong>Rob Walton </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fad8da8b-96ab-47cb-8087-560d211761ae\">agreed </a>to purchase American football's <strong>Denver Broncos</strong> for a reported $4.65bn, which if finalised by the league would make it the most expensive pro team ever sold.</p> <p>The Broncos sale, in particular, offers a fresh lens on the dynamics among <strong>National Football League</strong> owners, some of the most insular and wealthy groups in US society. The auction, administered this spring by merchant bank <strong>Allen &amp; Co</strong>, elicited bids from former <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong> great <strong>Magic Johnson</strong> and <strong>Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment</strong>, along with the Chelsea victors <strong>Todd Boehly</strong> and <strong>Clearlake Capital</strong>, among others.</p> <p>But the selection of Walton, the son of one of the wealthiest American dynasties with a personal net worth of $65bn, does more to preserve the status quo within pro sports than to shake it up. Walton's sister, <strong>Ann Walton Kroenke</strong>, is the wife of <strong>Los Angeles Rams </strong>and <strong>Arsenal FC</strong> owner <strong>Stan Kroenke</strong>. The evaluation period between the deadline for bids on Monday night and the announcement of a purchase-and-sale agreement barely 24 hours later pales in comparison to the more than two months of due diligence rendered on the Chelsea auction.</p> <p>It comes at a time when the NFL is in the limelight for its lack of diversity off the field. Former <strong>Miami Dolphins</strong> head coach <strong>Brian Flores</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19907879-325e-4564-9d45-2cf53b7ee990\">suing the league</a> for racial discrimination, while none of the 32 controlling owners is black even though they profit from the roughly 70 per cent of players who are. The league has described the suit as meritless, though commissioner <strong>Roger Goodell</strong> has conceded that, especially among coaching staff, the lack of diversity is “unacceptable”.</p> <p>When the Broncos deal was announced, Walton said that <strong>Ariel Investments</strong> co-chief executive <strong>Mellody Hobson</strong> will join the ownership group, making her the first black woman limited partner in an NFL franchise.</p> <p>On the financial front, American football stands alone among US pro men's leagues in forbidding private equity firms from taking any ownership stake in teams. Skyrocketing franchise valuations not only shrink the pool of candidates who are wealthy enough to buy controlling stakes, but also limit the number of individual minority investors able to buy from those who wish to cash out. &#xa0;</p> <p>Amid the current wave of record sports sales, that's worth bearing in mind.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Soon after striking a deal to buy <strong>AC Milan </strong>from hedge fund <strong>Elliott Management</strong>, <strong>RedBird</strong>'s <strong>Gerry Cardinale </strong>flew into Italy for an audience with legendary former player <strong>Paolo Maldini</strong>. Even for a former <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>dealmaker, buying an elite football club was like no other takeover.

But how much does Disney really <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32196d83-db92-4e1e-a636-08ea1e8be8d3\">want to spend</a> to keep broadcasting the IPL, with heavy competition from deep-pocketed rivals expected to at least double the price for rights compared with the $2.6bn the group paid five years ago.</p></li>  <li><p>The UK's <strong>Competition &amp; Markets Authority </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94ab8c20-8396-48aa-80e7-8599657361ee\">found evidence</a> of price-fixing in the sale of Scotland's <strong>Rangers Football Club</strong>'s replica kits and merchandise, provisionally finding that retailers <strong>JD Sports,</strong> <strong>Elite Sports </strong>and the club broke competition rules. The FT's Lex newsletter looks to history <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ad28fc1-d675-449f-b7db-e92fad8f19e2\">to explain</a> the economics of replica shirt sales.</p></li>  <li><p>Elite football is meritocratic for players, says FT columnist Simon Kuper, so why, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4638ad2d-6609-4406-8fa3-f0c6055ef0ec\">he asks</a>, can't the same be said for politicians?</p></li> </ul> <h1>Transfer Market</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Comcast's NBC Sports </strong>appointed <strong>Amy Rosenfeld</strong> as senior vice-president for <strong>Olympics</strong> and <strong>Paralympics</strong> production.

She will play a key role in NBC's coverage of the Paris Olympic Games in 2024.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/livescore/status/1534461479700684800\">https://twitter.com/livescore/status/1534461479700684800</a> <p><strong>Tammy Abraham </strong>had a smashing debut season at <strong>AS Roma</strong>, the Italian football club owned by US billionaire <strong>Dan Friedkin</strong>. The 24-year-old English striker bagged 27 goals and made five assists in 53 appearances, playing a leading role as the team won the inaugural <strong>Uefa Conference League </strong>and finished 6th in <strong>Serie A</strong>. So it was no surprise that the young talent was called up to the England national team at the end of a successful season. Everything under control, right? Not exactly. Watch on as Tammy's pre-match routine doesn't go quite as expected. His teammates are probably still laughing.
