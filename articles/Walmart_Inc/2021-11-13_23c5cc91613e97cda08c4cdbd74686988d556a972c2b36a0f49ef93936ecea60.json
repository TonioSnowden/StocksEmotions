  "text": "<p>After two decades of restructuring, six chief executives, relegation from the FTSE 100 and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6760502e-7bd0-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\">billions of costs</a>, investors are daring to ask: is Marks and Spencer finally fixed?</p> <p>This week, the British retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a364dd7d-b9cf-46e1-80aa-894b0229bcb6\">upgraded its profit forecasts</a> for the second time this year. It now expects to make £500m before exceptionals for the full year, close to pre-pandemic levels, as clothing demand recovers and an overhauled food offering gains traction with shoppers.</p> <p>M&amp;S's share price has doubled in the past year, while the value of some more sprightly rivals such as Asos and Boohoo has slumped. </p> <p>But nobody at the company's London headquarters is getting carried away just yet. M&amp;S's chair Archie Norman said the reforms his team were pushing through would fundamentally change the organisation, not just provide a shortlived boost to profits, but that meant the group still had some way to go.</p> <p>“We have fractured the old culture, but we have not yet built a new one,” he told the Financial Times. “I'd say we're about 40 per cent of the way there.”</p> <p>The food business is the most obvious success from the latest revamp, which began in 2016. Under Stuart Machin, a former supermarket executive, M&amp;S has gone from selling “food for tonight” using a mish-mash of confusing promotions, to being a credible “family shop” venue with simpler, better-value pricing and more emphasis on fresh produce.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2303a532-39ba-11e9-b856-5404d3811663\">joint venture with Ocado</a> has given M&amp;S the means to sell food online — something its small food stores and low average basket size had precluded — and increased its volumes.</p> <p>“Food is going from strength to strength,” said one person previously involved with the division. “The bigger volumes mean greater efficiency, less waste and stronger margins, because they get better terms from suppliers.”</p> <p>In the half-year to October 2, food sales were up 10 per cent on the same period before the pandemic and by 16 per cent once sales through cafés and franchise stores were stripped out. Operating profit was £143m, up from £92m two years ago.</p> <p>Clothing remains a work in progress but is also showing signs of improvement. M&amp;S has doubled down on areas where it has strong market positions, such as denim, schoolwear and lingerie and reduced the number of options in other areas. </p> <p>Ian Lance, fund manager at RWC and manager of Temple Bar Investment Trust, said: “Many investors had written off M&amp;S years ago and thus missed the transformative change that has happened under the new management, which saw their food retail business boosted by the Ocado deal and clothing and home make the transition to become the number two online clothes retailer in the UK. </p> <p>“The incredibly exciting part is that this transition has only just begun and has a long way to go. The market has yet to fully appreciate the potential of this business in our opinion.”</p> <p>James de Uphaugh at Majedie Asset Management was similarly upbeat: “After many years of false dawns at M&amp;S, investors' muscle memory is conditioned to be highly sceptical but M&amp;S has quietly attracted a top operational management team, capital allocation is now strong and importantly the interims showed that both food and clothing &amp; home are gaining market share.”</p> <p>However, one executive at a rival fashion chain was more muted. “Clothing had been in decline for so long it had to bounce back at some point,” the person said, adding that while value and availability had improved, M&amp;S was “not exactly winning over the nation”.</p> <p>“They need to get the basics right, then overlay that with something extra special — like they do in food. I don't see that yet.”</p> <p>Behind the scenes, M&amp;S has been working on other improvements. Its ageing IT infrastructure has been modernised, while its warehouse for online orders, which once regularly failed to cope with surges in demand, has been overhauled.</p> <p>The pandemic gave Norman the opportunity to accelerate the pace of change. “We were suddenly facing a very different set of problems so there was no point in having the usual meetings . . . it created a bias to action rather than excuses.”</p> <p>Long-debated changes to store management were pushed through, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ffab5b1-4e9f-493f-8470-f7832478f6d4\">7,000 mostly voluntary redundancies</a>. Online sales, stuck at just under 20 per cent for years, now account for 34 per cent. A new fashion ecommerce platform, MS2, was launched “with the authority to disrupt” and the company has started <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/454623ae-30b1-40f9-bddf-65af8775e83b\">selling third-party brands</a> such as Jigsaw and Jaeger online.</p> <p>Norman, who kicked off his tenure in 2017 by spelling out the “unvarnished truth” that M&amp;S did not have “a divine right to exist”, said changes in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e2438a0-5ea2-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68\">culture and leadership</a> had been even more important.</p> <p>“All the power — marketing, IT, human resources — sat in the centre, not at the shelf edge close to the customer,” he said.</p> <p>“The sense of institution was magnificent and very strong, but that's not a business,” added Norman, who promptly ejected top executives from their ninth-floor offices and sent them to sit with their teams.</p> <p>Other changes are happening more slowly, notably the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c8eb434-fa49-491e-955a-26a00d2b6c45\">overhaul of the store estate</a>. Norman noted that three-quarters of rival Next's stores were less than 20 years old, whereas many M&amp;S shops were in crumbling pre-war buildings on high streets where parking was difficult, footfall in decline and running costs high. </p> <p>“[Next] have been driving down this road for years while M&amp;S was asleep in the bus station,” he said. </p> <p>It is not the only unflattering comparison. Online sales at Next passed half of the total two years ago, its share of the UK clothing market is greater than M&amp;S's and its market capitalisation is more than twice that of its rival.</p> <p>Wary of claiming victory prematurely, M&amp;S's chief executive Steve Rowe acknowledged changes in the market, with names such as Debenhams, Arcadia, Gap and TM Lewin disappearing from high streets over the past year.</p> <p>He also pointed to the positive impact of pent-up demand on recent trading — which could tail off — and the growing challenges of inflation, pressures on household incomes and supply chain issues. </p> <p>Norman said financial restructurings that perked up profits for a while were easier and more commonplace than the kind of deep organisational restructuring he is attempting.</p> <p>He recalled his decade-long transformation of supermarket chain Asda in the 1990s: “We were outperforming the market after four years. But the real power of the organisation was not really apparent until about year seven.” </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Harriet Agnew</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Has M&amp;S finally got its spark back?'
