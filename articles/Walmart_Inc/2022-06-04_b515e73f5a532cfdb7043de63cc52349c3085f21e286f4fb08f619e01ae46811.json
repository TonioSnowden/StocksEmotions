  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Wall Street Forced Into The Debate On Abortion",
  "text": "<p>Activist investors submitted the proposals in December. Broadly, they ask each company to compile a report evaluating the risks and costs of restricted reproductive rights, including on employee hiring and retention. In early May, a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion suggested that the court could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p>Trillium Asset Management submitted the shareholder proposal for TJX, while Clean Yield Asset Management did so for Walmart. Both financial firms are focused on environmental, social and corporate-governance concerns. Educational Foundation of America, a private foundation that makes grants to nonprofits and invests with social and environmental impacts in mind, submitted the proposal for Lowe's.</p><p>Abortion rights is a polarizing issue. In a Wall Street Journal poll, conducted with the nonpartisan research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, 68% of respondents said they wouldn't like to see the court completely overturn Roe, while 30% supported such a move.</p><p>Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University predicts that if Roe v. Wade is struck down, there could be hundreds of abortion-related shareholder proposals on company proxies next year.</p><p>\"We expect for these large asset managers to consider abortion in the same way they consider other social-policy issues like climate change and diversity audits,\" she said. \"This one seems more head-on a business issue given that it affects a substantial portion of the employees.\"</p><p>The financial firms have at times initiated their own campaigns to pressure companies to pursue social changes. In 2017, State Street publicly identified more than 1,500 companies with all-male boards as part of its Fearless Girl campaign. Since then, 60% of those companies have added at least one female director. In 2018, following the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., BlackRock stripped retailers that sell guns from some of its funds. It has said its positions are about long-term returns, not politics.</p><p>At the respective shareholder meetings in the past week, the proposals got 13% support at Walmart and 32% support at Lowe's.</p><p>BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street declined to say how they voted. Ben Colton, global head of asset stewardship at State Street, said the firm evaluates social proposals \"with a focus on creating value and fulfilling our fiduciary duty,\" he said. Vanguard and BlackRock declined to comment. Together, the three firms own 20% of Lowe's, 18% of TJX and 10% of Walmart.</p><p>The shareholder groups asked the companies to address whether they plan to close or expand operations in states that enact antiabortion laws. The three retailers recommended investors vote \"no\" on the proposals, and they highlighted company benefits and programs for female employees. Lowe's and Walmart said the proposal was too broad. TJX, whose workforce is 77% women, said there was no need to compile a report when its current healthcare coverage offers many reproductive benefits, including abortion.</p>",
