Manufacturers, by contrast, managed to retain some sense of optimism, although developing problems include a large jump in input costs because of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad5e1a80-cecf-4b18-9035-ee50be9adfc6\">shipping problems</a> between Asia and Europe. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14821fa0-0e3e-4a95-8414-53a257ee9142\">European Central Bank</a> yesterday unveiled its latest measures to tackle the crisis with a shift in its bond-buying strategy as it left interest rates and its main stimulus package unchanged. Its description of a new “holistic and multi-faceted approach” foxed some analysts. “Why make it so complicated? Constructive ambiguity can be a good thing, until it is no longer constructive,” commented one strategist.</p> <p>There was no ambiguity, however, over the continuing threat from the virus as European leaders met virtually to discuss developments including the tightening of travel restrictions.</p> <p>As our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a56d94d-bc99-4ffd-9f54-3398f047cd57\">Brussels Briefing</a> newsletter reports, they are reluctant to close borders within the free movement zone — comprising the EU27 plus Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Iceland — but are considering toughening quarantines and testing, border checks and access from third countries. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8babbd7-0e50-4f2b-9698-e981785d541d\">France</a> said all visitors would now need to have passed a Covid-19 test less than three days before entering.</p> <p>Vaccines are also the subject of intense debate across the bloc. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dbfe495-5947-4dd0-9f43-5edc5e6d6dc7\">AstraZeneca</a> warned&#xa0;today&#xa0; that it would fail to meet delivery timetables for its jab, while Brussels is fighting back moves from Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Greece for it to be delivered before final authorisation from the EU medical regulator.&#xa0; Member states and the European Commission are also talking&#xa0; to pharma companies about how many shots can be extracted from individual capsules of vaccine. There is also discussion of proposals from Greece for a “vaccine passport” to make travel around the EU easier.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>Value investing guru <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c3ecb09-c4bd-4066-a462-af496725105d\">Seth Klarman</a> said <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong> decisions to cut interest rates to record low levels and flood the financial system with money had made it difficult to judge the health of the country's economy. “As with frogs in water that is slowly being heated to a boil, investors are being conditioned not to recognise the danger,” he wrote in the FT.</p> <p>The pandemic is forcing savers to switch to online platforms, in turn leading advisers to speed up their use of new technology, veteran investment funds chief <strong>Edward Bonham Carter</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1eed33f2-52fc-4308-a708-0f6e966bf67c\">told the FT</a>. The crisis has brought to the fore longstanding investor concerns about fees and complex charging structures. </p> <p>Personal finance columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b36e01c1-70f1-48e3-9d5e-993c37f7f2cf\">Merryn Somerset Webb</a> argues that a new wave of US fiscal stimulus may well lead to improved growth but will almost certainly result in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b36e01c1-70f1-48e3-9d5e-993c37f7f2cf\">rising inflation</a>.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>The prices of hundreds of essential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a3b8c02-df79-43ea-abc9-6494b4f12273\">pandemic products</a> have shot up on <strong>Amazon </strong>during the crisis. Most — but not all — were being sold by third-party sellers — but the company said the data failed to compare its prices with competitors such as Walmart and factor in increased storage costs or supply chain constraints.</p> <p>Some large companies in the UK have complained that they have been left out of <strong>coronavirus support schemes</strong> because the government is sticking to EU <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6faf5793-7141-40b4-890a-1e5bb79b884f\">state-aid rules</a> — even though the country has now left the bloc.</p> <p>The global <strong>healthcare industry</strong> is preparing for a permawar on Covid, says companies editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c7266b1-1fad-458e-8585-12dc3164fdce\">Tom Braithwaite</a>. Britain's vaccination efforts are being helped by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e914600-44ad-4901-8ef5-e7a5d2b0b744\">Wockhardt</a>, a once high-flying Indian pharma company that has been investigated by US regulators in the past for failings at its plants. </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e8e4c11-f863-4343-9c2b-48e79b3f8c48\">US House Democrats</a> said they stood ready to pass President Joe Biden's $1.9tn <strong>coronavirus relief bill</strong> by February 1 as new<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6962dabd-c94f-43d3-8edc-223e5be012e2\"> jobless claims</a> highlighted the economic cost of the pandemic which, the president warned, could result in the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33dffa6d-c2ec-474e-9c1b-9987c06ccd2d\">death toll</a> passing 500,000 next month. New initiatives announced by the Biden administration this week include the use of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d54bde97-076f-485e-9989-9d5a594f026e\">wartime powers</a> to boost production of medical supplies and joining the World Health Organization's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f8d0bb8-bf6e-48b5-aa06-2a3837d695ea\">Covax</a> project to secure vaccine supplies for poorer countries.</p> <p>Japan insisted the delayed <strong>2020 Olympics</strong> would go ahead this summer, even as the country's borders remained closed and Tokyo was in a state of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0335261-9b25-4b60-990d-f64e4be67d10\">coronavirus emergency</a>. Vaccines are not an issue: organisers do not believe national immunisation campaigns will reach healthy young athletes by the summer. National Olympic committees around the world need to make financial commitments to attend by the end of March.</p> <p>A gloomy suite of data highlighted the parlous state of the<strong> UK economy</strong> ahead of the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db6122d5-0efc-4dc7-8c17-0afbc3033924\">Budget</a> next month. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6fbaf71-30f8-40e5-8e23-e11bfbc647af\">Economic activity</a> is at its lowest since May; <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6b44518-a2a0-490d-bfc5-653cdd5dbda0\">consumer spending</a> fell sharply in early January; there was little Christmas cheer for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8612a435-8d54-4f45-b653-95f536ca2dac\">retailers</a>; and the public finances continued to deteriorate. Ministers, meanwhile, are discussing increased support for workers forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01efa185-e244-4489-a7e8-961b93ecb5c3\">self-isolate</a>. </p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Kool with a K comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b5b71fe-9063-40c1-b886-171a4d8e959b?commentID=2b53aa67-35c5-4185-9fb6-a6b3e52c8589\">Small UK businesses are ‘running out of cash', chancellor warned</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“I've worked in the SME sector and the corporate sector. SME owners are the lifeblood of the economy and this is depressing on so many levels.
