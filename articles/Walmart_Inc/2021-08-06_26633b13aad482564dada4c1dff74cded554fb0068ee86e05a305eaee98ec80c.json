  "text": "<p>Amazon scored a legal win over Mukesh Ambani in India after the country's Supreme Court upheld a decision by an international arbitrator to halt the $3.4bn purchase of Future Retail by the billionaire's Reliance Industries.</p> <p>The US ecommerce group last year took the case to emergency arbitration, alleging that the deal between Future and Reliance violated a contract between Amazon and the former. The Singapore arbitration court in October ordered a freeze on the deal until it heard the case.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The ruling on Friday to recognise the arbitrator's order came a day after India's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bb63863-c0eb-4e5b-99bd-b023847d3595\">scrap</a> a retrospective tax that had been heavily criticised by foreign investors and rejected by international courts. Together, the two decisions represent significant legal victories that could help level the playing field for international investors in one of Asia's biggest economies.</p> <p>“In many ways, the ruling provides reassurance that Indian courts would step in and respect the arbitration process,” said Promod Nair, an advocate and arbitrator based in Bangalore. “The fact that a foreign investor succeeded in judicial proceedings against Reliance, essentially India's biggest industrial conglomerate, is a wonderful testament to the neutrality of the Indian judicial system.”</p> <p>Amazon and Reliance are going head-to-head for dominance of India's burgeoning ecommerce market. Amazon alleged that the sale of Future, announced last year, breached a contract it had with a subsidiary of the Indian company that barred it from selling its retail assets without the US group's consent.</p> <p>The Supreme Court's Justice Rohinton Nariman ruled that the halting of the deal by the Singapore arbitrator was enforceable, saying that the order “<a href=\"https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-amazon-in-case-against-future-retail-emergency-award-enforceable-in-indian-law-178981\">holds good</a>” in India. Arbitration hearings are expected to continue through the year. </p> <p>“We welcome the verdict of the honourable Supreme Court of India upholding the emergency arbitrator's award. We hope that this will hasten a resolution of this dispute with the Future Group,” Amazon said on Friday.</p> <p>Future “is advised that it has remedies available in law, which it will exercise”, the company said in a statement to India's stock exchanges. It “intends to pursue all available avenues to conclude the deal [with Reliance] to protect the interests of its stakeholders and workforce”. Future has said it could face bankruptcy if the Reliance deal does not go ahead. </p> <p>The fight for India's retail market is being led by Amazon and Walmart-owned ecommerce group Flipkart, which combined command about 70 per cent of the online market. The pair are up against Ambani's vast empire of brick and mortar stores, which are rapidly pushing into the online space. Reliance's acquisition of Future's 1,500 shops would have cemented its position as the country's largest retailer. </p> <p>Amazon and Walmart have been bullish on the promise of India's growing middle class but have been hit with regulatory hurdles. New Delhi this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85207008-5510-43a1-9867-dd7d85767678\">threatened</a> Flipkart, which was recently valued at $37bn, with a $1.35bn fine over allegations it violated India's foreign investment laws. </p> <p>“There was a lot of integration going on between Reliance and Future, it is a slightly shocking decision,” said Sanjeev Kumar, an analyst at Forrester in New Delhi. “This puts the brakes on everything.” </p> <p>Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court's ruling. </p> <p>During the pandemic, cash-strapped Future has improved the online services of its vast retail network spanning fashion to grocery, one of the fastest-growing ecommerce segments, Kumar added. “This ruling leaves Amazon in a stronger position.”</p> <p>Amazon is under increasing scrutiny from New Delhi, with antitrust regulator the Competition Commission of India restarting a probe against it and Flipkart over allegations of anti-competitive behaviour. Amazon said it was in compliance with Indian laws and would co-operate with competition authorities.</p><p>Source: Stephanie Findlay in New Delhi  2021 'Amazon secures legal victory over Ambani in $3.4bn India retail battle' FT.com 6 August.
