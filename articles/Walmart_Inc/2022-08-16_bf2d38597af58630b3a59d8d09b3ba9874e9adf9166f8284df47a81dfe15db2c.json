  "title": "Walmart Revenue, Profit Rise as Higher Prices Lift Business; The nation's largest retail chain by sales says efforts to clear out excess inventory are continuing",
  "text": "<p>Walmart Inc.'s revenue and profit rose in the second quarter as the retail giant benefited from higher prices and consumers stepping up shopping trips to its stores.</p><p>Walmart on Tuesday said that it is gaining market share in some categories such as grocery as shoppers grapple with inflation and that some Covid-19 related costs have shrunk. But higher prices have led shoppers to hold back on some purchases, prioritizing lower-margin food items, eating into profits. Walmart is also selling through a glut of inventory leading to higher discounts.</p><p>\"The actions we've taken to improve inventory levels in the U.S., along with a heavier mix of sales in grocery, put pressure on profit margin,\" said Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon in a statement.</p><p>Walmart's U.S. comparable sales, those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 6.5% in the quarter ended July 29, helped by higher prices, market share gains in grocery and strong store brand product sales. Overall, revenue rose 8.4% to $152.86 billion.</p><p>Both Walmart, the nation's largest retailer by revenue, and Target Corp. sent warnings in recent weeks that efforts to clear out excess inventory and weaker-than-expected demand for a range of products would diminish their profits this year.</p><p>But in the latest quarter, profits rose. Walmart said its net income in the three months ended in July was $5.15 billion, compared with $4.28 billion a year earlier. On a per-share basis excluding one-time items, the profit was $1.77, compared with the $1.62 a share expected from analysts, according to a FactSet poll.</p><p>In early trading Walmart shares rose more than 3% to $137.17. Walmart shares through Monday's close are down 8.4% this year, compared with a 9.8% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index and 6.7% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Walmart Revenue, Profit Rise as Higher Prices Lift Business</p>",
