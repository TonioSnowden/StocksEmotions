  "title": "Banking & Finance:  India's Paytm Nears Its IPO  ----  By Shefali Anand in New Delhi and Jing Yang in Hong Kong",
  "text": "<p>   Paytm, a pioneer in mobile payments in India and one of the country's best-known startups, set out years ago to build a digital-finance ecosystem much like Ant Group Co.'s Alipay in China. </p><p>   Now, as Paytm's owner nears a $2.2 billion listing that will see it beat Ant to the public markets, the company isn't the dominant player it wanted to become and faces mounting challenges in an increasingly crowded Indian payments market. It has been overtaken in one area by deep-pocketed rivals including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Walmart Inc.-backed Indian startup PhonePe. </p><p>   One97 Communications Ltd., which owns Paytm, is targeting a market valuation of $25 billion when it goes public at home this autumn. The listing will generate hefty profit for 43-year-old founder Vikay Shekhar Sharma and a list of investors including SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. </p><p>   Ant has invested $900 million in One97 and would be among the biggest winners in the deal, which is taking place at a time of tensions between India and China. Ant intends to reduce its stake to under 25% from 29.6%, according to people familiar with Ant's thinking. </p><p>   Of those companies, Paytm, an abbreviation for \"Pay through mobile,\" gained the most local traction. Between 2015 and 2017, Ant dispatched engineers and technical staff to Paytm's offices in Noida to help scale up its payments platform and tackle issues such as fraud prevention, said people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Paytm's mobile-payments app experienced a surge in downloads during that period, after India's government suddenly canceled 86% of the country's physical cash in circulation to root out corruption, tax evasion and counterfeit bills. Paytm became synonymous with e-wallets, digital accounts that could be used to pay utility bills, and buy everyday goods and services. </p><p>   Paytm boasted 225 million subscribers by 2017, more than any other company in India, and Berkshire paid about $300 million the following year for a small stake in One97. </p><p>   Mr. Sharma, who founded One97 in 2000 and is its chairman and chief executive, has in the past drawn parallels between his modest roots and the backgrounds of Mr. Buffett and Ant's controlling shareholder, Jack Ma. He predicted a few years ago that Paytm would have half a billion users by 2020. </p><p>   Paytm didn't reach that goal of having half a billion users by 2020. As of March, One97 served 333 million consumers, about a third of whom transacted on Paytm's platform at least once during the preceding year, according to the company's draft IPO prospectus. India had around 500 million smartphone users at the end of 2019, according to techARC, a research firm. </p><p>   Ant dialed back its direct involvement in Paytm after Paytm's development got under way. Ant's global ambitions have been complicated by geopolitical tensions. Last year, deadly border clashes between China and India sparked a backlash in the South Asian country against mobile apps owned by companies in China. </p><p>   After India started to apply more scrutiny to Chinese investments, Ant Chairman and CEO Eric Jing, a Chinese national, was replaced on One97's board with Douglas Feagin, another Ant executive and a U.S. citizen. The change, which took place this year, was initiated by Ant and took place as Mr. Jing needed to turn more of his focus to the Hangzhou-based company's internal affairs following its scuttled IPO, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Top executives at Ant and One97 still maintain regular communication and sometimes consult each other on strategic decisions, the people said. </p><p>   Unlike Ant, One97 hasn't produced an annual profit in recent years. Its revenue from payment and financial services has increased, but total income declined in its last fiscal year because the pandemic hurt some of its other businesses. </p><p>   Paytm has also had to contend with much more competition after India introduced a government-run digital-payments network called the Unified Payments Interface, which facilitates direct transfers between bank accounts. </p><p>   Close to nine out of 10 mobile-payment transactions in India are now UPI based, and e-wallets have fallen out of favor. </p><p></p>",
