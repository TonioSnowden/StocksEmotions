  "title": "U.S. Consumers Show Strength With Jump in Retail Sales; Robust spending and a tight labor market complicate the Federal Reserve's fight against high inflation",
  "text": "<p>Shoppers spent more on increasingly expensive everyday staples such as gasoline and food, but they also shelled out more for big-ticket items such as cars and furniture. Some of the spending was due to purchases of building materials and home furnishings in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, economists said.</p><p>The jump in sales showed households continued to have the ability to spend despite inflation running close to a four-decade high and looming economic uncertainty. Many households built up financial buffers earlier in the pandemic thanks to trillions of dollars in government stimulus, fewer opportunities to spend and higher wages. Jobs also remain plentiful, despite an increase in layoffs in some sectors such as tech.</p><p>Retailers also started discounting early ahead of the traditional holiday shopping season, and some economists said strong October sales could harbinger less consumer spending later in the year.</p><p>\"Maybe they are trying to get more of their shopping done ahead of time,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup Inc. \"That is taking spending away from December and November and shifting it to October.\"</p><p>Unlike many government reports, retail sales aren't adjusted for inflation, so swings can reflect price differences in addition to purchase totals. The report also offers a partial picture of consumer demand because it doesn't include spending on services such as travel, housing and utilities. The Commerce Department will release new household spending figures covering goods and services at the end of November.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is raising rates at the most aggressive pace since the early 1980s to combat inflation by slowing the economy. Strong consumer demand and a tight labor market are making that task more difficult—and raises the chance officials raise rates higher and keep them there longer.</p><p>\"I'm looking at a labor market that is so tight, I don't know how you continue to bring this level of inflation down without having some real slowing, and maybe we even have contraction in the economy to get there,\" Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in an interview conducted before release of the retail-sales report.</p><p>Some of Ms. George's colleagues have recently said that they still see a way for the Fed to bring inflation down without a serious downturn, but Ms. George was more circumspect. \"I have not in my 40 years with the Fed seen a time of this kind of tightening that you didn't get some painful outcomes,\" she said.</p><p>Retail sales—which includes spending on clothing, wine and ottomans but also meals at restaurants—have generally risen in recent months. Consumers spent more in October at auto dealers, furniture stores, grocery stores and gasoline stations.</p><p>Inflation eased in October to the slowest pace since January but remained elevated. Prices rose 7.7% in October from the same month a year before, the Labor Department said last week, slowing from 9.1% in June, which was the highest in four decades.</p><p>The consumer-price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in October from September, meaning that retail sales outpaced the rate of price increases.</p><p>Some categories that saw a burst of pandemic-related buying in recent years continued to show signs of easing. Sales at electronics stores declined, for instance.</p><p>Economists estimate that consumers have spent down some of their excess savings, but a considerable chunk remains. U.S. households still had around $1.7 trillion in savings as of mid-2022. That is above what they would have saved if income and spending had grown in line with the prepandemic economy, according to estimates by Fed economists published last month.</p><p>\"While this buffer is dwindling, for now it is likely still providing some needed balance sheet support that could help to stanch a negative feedback loop were the economy to slow,\" the Fed report said.</p><p>Economists and executives are closely watching consumer spending in the early weeks of the important holiday selling season, with some retailers starting holiday promotions earlier this year. Black Friday, a key shopping holiday, is next week.</p><p>Target Corp. said shoppers pulled back in recent weeks, cutting into sales in the retailer's latest quarter. Walmart Inc., on the other hand, reported Tuesday that comparable U.S. sales rose 8.2% in its third quarter compared with a year earlier. The company said that shopper visits increased 2.1% in the quarter ended Oct. 28.</p><p>Home Depot Inc. said that comparable sales increased 4.3% in its third quarter as big-ticket transactions rose and as consumers choose to renovate their homes instead of moving because of rising interest rates.</p><p>Alana Carr is the part-owner of four specialty retailers in Washington state. Ms. Carr said her toy store, gift shops and jewelry retailer have all done well this year, with overall sales up by double-digits compared with 2021.</p><p>\"We are on track to have our best year ever,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Carr said she has been ready for the holiday shopping season since September. She ordered products early to avoid the shortages she experienced last year. She said she is worried that selling might be a bit softer because of the economic uncertainty and inflation eating into consumer budgets.</p><p>Greg Hughes, president of an Indianapolis-based distributor and manufacturer of board games, is concerned some of his retail customers are overstocked, in a contrast to shortages last year. Mr. Hughes said he is closely watching for a surge in last-minute orders right after Black Friday, as was typical in the years before the pandemic.</p><p>\"Black Friday tells so much about where things are,\" he said. \"If we see a trickle, then the cautious side is the one that is prevailing.\"</p><p>—Harriet Torry and Nick Timiraos contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Consumers Show Strength With Jump in Retail Sales</p>",
