The U.S. and its allies have accused Russia of planning to use false reports of attacks on separatists as a pretext for an invasion. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Russia has filed a report with the United Nations alleging that Ukraine's military has committed “crimes” against residents of the eastern Donbas region.</p><p>“This is likely to be the bigger concern for NATO and the U.S., if separatist forces try and goad Ukrainian forces into a counter-response, thus creating an excuse for a Russian incursion, and for all hell to break loose,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.</p><p>“The bigger risk for markets is that President Putin simply leaves the bulk of his forces on the border and simply plays a game of cat and mouse for the next few weeks and months,” Hewson said.</p><p>President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday morning that a Russian invasion could happen in the next “several days.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, addressing the U.N. Security Council, called on Russia to withdraw troops and to resume negotiations over security concerns.</p><p>“The market reacted this week as if something significant in the direction of de-escalation has happened, but that doesn't seem to be the case, and yet the market has only partially priced back in a higher level of concern,” said the Saxo Bank strategy team, in a note to clients.</p><p>“This geopolitical issue can remain the source of significant market volatility on fresh developments/headlines, especially ahead of the weekend if tensions are escalating again today or tomorrow,” said the Saxo team.</p><p>The uncertainty sent gold prices higher by 0.9% to $1,887.70 an ounce, with the U.S. dollar DXY modestly higher. Oil prices CL00 were under pressure, after tumbling in late trade on Wednesday amid reports that the U.S. and Iran were close to reaching an agreement over nuclear talks.</p><p>Investors sifted through a batch of U.S. economic data, including a rise in first-time jobless claims, a January fall in housing starts and a fall in the Philadelphia Fed's regional manufacturing index.</p><p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are both due to speak later Thursday.</p><p>Wednesday's minutes of the January Federal Reserve meeting provided few new details for investors who are now pricing about six interest rate increases this year, but investors are becoming concerned that the Fed may not be able to slow inflation without slowing the economy. Fed officials will have another round of inflation and employment data before making their decision next month.</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Walmart Inc.WMT were in focus, rising 1.6% after reporting fourth-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations and raising its dividend.</p><p>Palantir Technologies Inc.PLTRgrew revenue more quickly than anticipated in its latest quarter, though earnings per share fell short of expectations.
