  "text": "<p>Excluding gasoline and autos, retail sales grew by 0.3% in September from the prior month.</p><p>Sales at gasoline stations, a proxy for spending by car owners, declined 1.4% last month from August but remained 21% higher than a year before. Gasoline prices dropped in September for the third month in a row, falling 4.9% from August. Still, they were up more than 18% from the same month a year ago. The average cost of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $3.90 on Friday, according AAA/OPIS. That is down from a June peak of just more than $5 a gallon.</p><p>Spending declined in categories linked to big purchases like cars, televisions, beds and golf clubs. Purchases at electronics and appliance stores dropped 0.8% in September while spending at furniture stores fell 0.7%.</p><p>At the start of the pandemic, consumers bought new dishwashers and backyard furniture as they shifted spending into products and away from vacations. That trend has started to somewhat reverse in recent months.</p><p>Sales have fluctuated but generally risen in recent months amid higher prices and rising interest rates that can make big purchases more expensive. High inflation means consumers are getting less for their spending. Consumer prices grew 0.4% in September from August while retail spending was flat.</p><p>\"Retail sales are strong because prices are rising quickly,\" said Chris Varvares, the co-head of U.S. economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Overall consumer prices climbed 8.2% in September from the same month a year ago, tempered by a decline in gasoline prices that was partially offset by higher food costs, the Labor Department said Thursday in a separate report.</p><p>Unlike many government reports, retail sales aren't adjusted for inflation, so some swings reflect price changes rather than shifts in the amounts purchased. Higher interest rates also make purchases bought on credit more expensive.</p><p>Shoppers spent more in stores selling must-haves like ingredients for dinner and shampoo. They also boosted online purchases.</p><p>Spending at restaurants and bars grew 0.5% in September from the prior month. But prices at restaurants grew 0.9% in the same month, according to a separate Labor Department report released Thursday, meaning that consumers are getting less for their spending.</p><p>Scott Brave, the head of economic analytics for Morning Consult, said consumers have started to pull back on optional purchases while still spending on the essentials.</p><p>\"They are having to make tough decisions,\" he said.</p><p>A challenging housing market has weighed on home-building this year. The number of housing units starting to be built has declined in recent months from springtime highs. Spending at stores selling lumber and plumbing fixtures by both professionals and consumers declined 0.4% in September.</p><p>Spending on a year-over-year basis essentially met the year-over-year inflation rate. Total retail sales grew 8.2% in September from a year ago.</p><p>Retailers have been implementing holiday sales earlier this year as they try to get rid of excess inventory. Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. have rolled out sales recently. These events aren't reflected in Friday's report, which covers transactions in September.</p><p>Richard Moody, chief economist at bank Regions Financial Corp., said September's sales figures are unlikely to affect Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions. In the coming months, discounting by retailers could start showing up in inflation and sales data, he said, especially in the run up to the holiday season.</p><p>\"You are past the big back-to-school spending period,\" he said. \"Holiday shopping really ramps up later in the year.\"</p><p>Consumers continue to have a gloomy attitude about the economy, with many blaming inflation for worsening their financial situations, according to surveys by the University of Michigan. While consumer sentiment has improved in recent months it remains low, due in part to inflation worries.</p><p>The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan stood at 59.8 in October, up from 58.6 in September, the highest reading since April. Sentiment is now 9.8 points above the all-time low reached in June.</p><p>Amilcar Caputo, who works at a food manufacturer in Minnesota, said he recently has started buying skirt steaks instead of rib-eye cuts after prices rose.</p><p>\"I'm Brazilian. I love to barbecue. Meat is a big thing,\" he said. \"I had to look for other options.\"</p>",
