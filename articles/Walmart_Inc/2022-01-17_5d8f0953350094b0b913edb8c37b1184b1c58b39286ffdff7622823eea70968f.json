  "title": "China Probes a Sam's Club Store Over Food-Safety Issues; Local regulator's investigation into Walmart-owned store comes as China steps up scrutiny into U.S. retailer",
  "text": "<p>The probe follows consumer complaints about spoiled beef, the regulator, a local branch of China's top market watchdog, said.</p><p>After initial sample checks, the regulator found that the product didn't meet standards and has ordered the store to recall all products from the same batch, it said.</p><p>The regulator said it also found improper practices at the store, including an imperfect system of rules and regulations, and overly high temperatures in its utility rooms.</p><p>Walmart didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p>Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has faced heightened scrutiny in China in recent weeks, after the passage of a U.S. law that bans virtually all imports from the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang over forced-labor and human-rights concerns.</p><p>In late December, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer attracted anger on Chinese social media after internet users accused Walmart of having stopped stocking products from Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has conducted a campaign of forcible assimilation against religious minorities. Shortly afterward, following local media reports that Walmart wasn't selling products from Xinjiang, the company was warned by China's anticorruption watchdog.</p><p>Last week, authorities and state media drew attention to a roughly $50,000 fine against Walmart in 2021, an unusual move by regulators to publicly highlight small fines for past infractions.</p><p>Walmart hasn't publicly discussed the various actions by Chinese authorities.</p><p>Researchers say China's government has detained hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim minorities in a network of internment camps in Xinjiang as part of an assimilation campaign, which they say also includes mass surveillance and stringent birth controls.</p><p>U.S. officials, along with some lawmakers from other Western countries and some human-rights activists, have said Beijing's treatment of mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang amounts to a form of genocide.</p><p>China's government rejects the allegation. It has described the camps as vocational training facilities designed to improve livelihoods and combat religious extremism.</p><p>Write to Yifan Wang at Yifan.Wang@wsj.com</p><p>China Probes a Sam's Club Store Over Food-Safety Issues</p>",
