  "text": "<p>TDR Capital's claim of a 19.8 times return on its Asda investment (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c21f0550-4f8d-4ea8-9fba-872eb174ba99\">Report</a>, April 19) shows that creativity is alive and well in private equity. Even if the maths behind this figure are correct, it is still economically misleading.</p> <p>The investors who bought Asda a year ago almost certainly have generated a big paper gain. Since they bought the company cheaply from Walmart and its earnings then increased in 2021, Asda's value could well have risen by at least one-half. Putting in only a sliver of true equity (12 per cent of the purchase price) gave the investors very high gearing. This magnifies the impact on their equity investment, whose value could thus have risen by, say, 5-7 times.</p> <p>Getting a return of 5-7 times your money in a year is already startling. So how does that go on to become what your article rightly characterises as an “eye-watering” 19.8 times?</p> <p>The natural way to read TDR's claim is that it measures the change in value of the £780mn of equity that TDR and the Issa brothers invested in the Asda buyout. But that would mean Asda's value had risen more than threefold, from £6.8bn to £21.2bn. That is clearly nonsense: Asda is a supermarket, not a tech company.</p> <p>Whatever TDR's 19.8 times figure is measuring, it is not the increase in value of that initial £780mn. Inflation seems to be creeping from the wider economy into private equity financial engineering. Without more information, one can only conclude that TDR found a clever way to transform a (plausible and impressive) 5-7 times into a (misleading) 19.8 times. Then it could not resist the urge to over-egg the marketing pudding.</p> <p>In a rational world, sleights of hand like this would undermine trust in so-called “alternative investments”. This latest example gives policymakers and investors a new reason to be asking themselves an old question: what does the lack of public scrutiny allow alternative investment firms to get away with behind closed doors?</p> <p><strong>Peter Morris</strong> <br><em>London N5, UK</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Asda deal highlights need for more scrutiny of PE valuations ' FT.com 28 April.
