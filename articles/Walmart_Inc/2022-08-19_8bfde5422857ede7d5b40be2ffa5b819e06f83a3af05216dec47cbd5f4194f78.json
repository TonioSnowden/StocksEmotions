  "title": "Harlan Band's Descent Started with an Easy Online Adderall Prescription; The 29-year-old man got the amphetamine through a telemedicine startup where some clinicians felt pressure to prescribe the drug",
  "text": "<p>In his first appointment with Shabnam Rahimi, a nurse practitioner working for Done, Mr. Band said he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as a boy, according to medical records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Now that Mr. Band was in college, he had trouble focusing on his studies and believed the pills would help. He didn't reveal that he was a recovering drug addict.</p><p>After the evaluation, the Los Angeles man picked up a 30-day supply of generic Adderall from Walgreens.</p><p>Mr. Band's use of the prescription stimulants preceded a relapse later in the fall of 2020 that left a string of fresh needle marks on both of his arms. His mother emailed Done after later finding one of his prescriptions.</p><p>\"Looking at your website it looks as if getting amphetamines is as easy as 1-2-3,\" Debra Dion wrote. \"I wonder if any part of your work is assessing whether or not you are dealing with an addict?\"</p><p>Done declined to comment about Mr. Band, citing patient privacy. The company said it is a technology platform that connects patients with medical professionals and doesn't prescribe medications.</p><p>Done and similar telemedicine companies such as Cerebral Inc. have treated tens of thousands of patients seeking relief from ADHD over the past two years. The pandemic prompted the U.S. to suspend requirements that patients be evaluated in person before getting Adderall, a change that has fueled rapid growth of these online businesses.</p><p>Adderall, which can produce a euphoric high and lead to dependence, is a Schedule II controlled substance, the same legal category as opioid pain relievers OxyContin and Vicodin. Stimulants like Adderall are among the most commonly abused prescription drugs, a U.S. government survey found.</p><p>The ease of acquiring a prescription stimulant with a video call, popular with customers, has coincided with an increase in Adderall prescriptions in the U.S. and drawn scrutiny by government officials.</p><p>Cerebral faces a federal investigation into possible violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The company said it was cooperating with authorities and that it would stop prescribing stimulants for ADHD. A similar startup closed in April. Done is now one of the last telemedicine companies in the stimulant business, and it has picked up patients from its former rivals.</p><p>CVS Health Corp. and Walmart Inc. said in May that theirpharmacies would no longer fill controlled substance prescriptions for Done and Cerebral. Done said it was seeking to provide the companies more details about its practices and commitment to high-quality psychiatric care.</p><p>Ms. Rahimi, the Done clinician, described Mr. Band as a well-groomed pre-med student who had \"good insight\" for seeking treatment, according to notes from their Oct. 14, 2020, video call. Mr. Band revealed no substance-use disorders, and Ms. Rahimi concluded he was a low-risk patient.</p><p>At the time, Mr. Band was in a sober-living house run by Phoenix Rising, an addiction-treatment center. It was his second try at kicking drugs that year. He had been addicted to opioids, mostly heroin, for at least 10 years and told rehab counselors he had also abused stimulants, tranquilizers, alcohol and marijuana. In a disheartening cycle, Mr. Band would get treatment, abstain for weeks or months and then relapse, his family said.</p><p>It is difficult to pinpoint any single reason why recovering addicts relapse, but one risk of prescribing Adderall to them is that the medication can increase their craving for other drugs, according to mental-health professionals. They say patients with a drug history such as Mr. Band's need to be monitored closely for signs they are abusing the medication.</p><p>Former Done employees said the company and some of its clinicians paid more attention to signing up new patients than monitoring existing ones. Done said it doesn't give priority to growth over patient safety.</p><p>In November 2020, Done ended a requirement that patients participate in monthly follow-up appointments before receiving prescription renewals or dosage increases. Patients were instead asked to complete an online form for the requests. \"We heard you and we understand that keeping up with follow-up appointments every month has been very difficult and not ADHD friendly,\" the company said in an email to patients announcing the change.</p><p>Done clinicians such as Ms. Rahimi work as independent contractors for the company and are paid as much as $10 for each monthly renewal. One clinician said she made roughly $20,000 a month renewing prescriptions for her more than 2,000 patients, sometimes at a pace of two refills a minute.</p><p>The company advertises heavily on TikTok, Instagram and other social-media platforms, promoting a one-minute ADHD assessment ahead of its 30-minute evaluations. Done charges patients a $79 monthly service fee for \"worry-free refills\" and clinician responses to questions.</p><p>Ms. Rahimi, who no longer works for the company, said she didn't recall Mr. Band. She and other former Done clinicians said tight appointment schedules had them moving quickly from one call to the next, making it difficult to conduct extensive medical evaluations.</p><p>Nearly every caller wanted a prescription, and the company expected clinicians would largely comply, Ms. Rahimi said. \"You can't disappoint the patient,\" she said. \"There was that pressure to give stimulants to everyone.\"</p><p>An internal company report last year from Done's chief medical officer at the time said that multiple Done providers had \"expressed a perception of pressure to diagnose ADHD and prescribe stimulants.\"</p><p>Done said the report, which addressed Mr. Band's case and other issues, was irrelevant to its business. The company said it relies on clinicians to use their judgment and follow proper procedures.</p><p>Done founder and Chief Executive Officer Ruthia He is a former Facebook product manager with no medical training. Ms. He didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Mr. Band had bragged to a housemate, James Walker, about how easy it was to get stimulants through Done, Mr. Walker said. He recalled suggesting to Mr. Band that he avoid all such drugs for a while. Mr. Walker, another recovering addict, said he believed the pills \"had everything to do with his relapse.\"</p><p>This article about Mr. Band's interactions with Done is based on internal company documents, government reports, interviews with Mr. Band's family and current and former Done employees. Mr. Band's mother provided text messages, medical records and emails.</p><p>Horror show</p><p>A few months after Mr. Band was born in 1991, his family moved into a historic 9-bedroom Spanish-style house in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles. His father, Charles Band, was a successful filmmaker of scores of low-budget horror movies, including \"Puppet Master,\" one of his best known. Mr. Band's parents divorced a few years later, and he moved to the city's San Fernando Valley with his mother, Ms. Dion.</p><p>Mr. Band attended private schools and struggled academically, Ms. Dion said. He was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed a stimulant, just as he had told Ms. Rahimi, the Done clinician. Ms. Dion said her son didn't like how the pills made him feel and quit taking them.</p><p>Mr. Band hurt his back in an all-terrain vehicle accident as a teenager and suffered lingering pain. He was prescribed OxyContin when he was about 18. Mr. Band had used marijuana, but the opioid changed everything, his mother and younger brother Zalman Band said.</p><p>He worked on and offâ€”in construction, at a call center, a supermarket and sometimes with his father. He also spent time in jail and passed through at least seven drug-treatment centers.</p><p>Just before New Year's Eve in 2019, Mr. Band resolved to get fit and start school. He had been off drugs since entering a detox facility that fall and was in a sober-living house. He started 2020 hoping to catch up from the years lost to addiction, and he enrolled for the spring semester at Los Angeles Pierce College, a two-year community college, his brother said. Mr. Band, an avid reader, traded the suspense of Michael Connelly crime novels for the stoicism of Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, the lockdown forced Mr. Band out of his sober-living house, and he returned to using heroin. His family sent him to the Phoenix Rising facility near Palm Springs, Calif. \"I don't want to die. I want a real life,\" he said during his initial interview on April 13, 2020, records show.</p><p>Mr. Band entered an outpatient program and over the following six months he was drug-tested regularly. After getting clean once again, he re-enrolled for online classes at Pierce in the fall semester.</p><p>He wanted help focusing on schoolwork, and his private psychiatry office prescribed him a stimulant with a lower risk for abuse than Adderall. Clinicians from that office had seen him nearly 30 times and through two rehab programs over the previous year. In October 2020, Mr. Band said the medicine wasn't working, so they prescribed a different low-risk stimulant. He agreed not to change or add any medications without consulting the office.</p><p>A week later, Mr. Band had his first video call with Ms. Rahimi. He had texted his father for $199 to cover an evaluation by his \"new psych.\"</p><p>Red flags</p><p>Ms. Rahimi had only recently joined the company when she met Mr. Band in October 2020. She specialized in family medicine, she said, and hadn't previously diagnosed many ADHD cases.</p><p>As a safeguard against abuse, clinicians working in California are required to check a state database for past controlled-substance prescriptions. Other states have similar measures.</p><p>Ms. Rahimi, working in California, wrote in her notes that the database showed \"no red flags\" for Mr. Band. She apparently missed one: a prescription for generic Suboxone, used to help opiate addicts quit. Mr. Band was prescribed the drug after checking into rehab six months earlier, according to the database.</p><p>Done's internal report last year said it was unclear whether Ms. Rahimi had appropriately reviewed Mr. Band's database record. Ms. Rahimi said she didn't recall. She said Done staff also checked prescription databases and shouldn't have scheduled an appointment with a patient who had a drug-use history.</p><p>The report noted that thousands of Done patients were transferred to new clinicians without timely follow-ups, including clinicians who didn't hold licenses to write prescriptions in states where their patients were located. Done declined to comment on any element of the report.</p><p>Psychiatrists say ADHD is a complex mental-health diagnosis, and traditional evaluations can take 90 minutes or more. Done advertises 30-minute appointments. Some evaluations have lasted 10 minutes or less, according to internal reports viewed by the Journal. Ms. Rahimi said she sometimes had only 10 to 15 minutes to spend with patients.</p><p>Done said it doesn't schedule evaluations for less than 30 minutes.</p><p>\"It would be impossible to do a full work-up in 30 minutes and feel comfortable about the risk factors related to substance abuse,\" said David Goodman, a psychiatrist specializing in ADHD at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Drug addicts properly diagnosed with ADHD can benefit from treatment with the stimulants, he said, but they must be closely managed.</p><p>Done's clinical president, David Brody, shared with clinicians a case study of an ADHD patient with \"a history of arrests related to his attempts to obtain methamphetamine illicitly,\" according to a copy of an email dated Aug. 26, 2021, and viewed by the Journal. Dr. Brody wrote that Done's patient-first philosophy called for treating the patient with stimulants.</p><p>Dr. Brody didn't respond to requests for comment. Done said clinicians have autonomy over all treatment decisions.</p><p>After Mr. Band started taking Adderall, his housemate Mr. Walker said he told him the pills could make him crave other drugs. \"It was pretty apparent, seeing day by day how the Adderall affected him,\" he said. Once gregarious, Mr. Band became emotionless and irritable, Mr. Walker recalled.</p><p>Mr. Band received a second and third prescription from Ms. Rahimi on Nov. 11, 2020, including a new pill that increased his dosage. The prescriptions also were for a longer duration, a 90-day supply instead of 30, a period experts say is unusual. Done declined to provide Mr. Band's mother with clinical notes from the appointment that might explain the decision, saying \"the medical record notes we send to patients are only based on the approved initial diagnosis clinician notes.\"</p><p>A week before Ms. Rahimi renewed Mr. Band's prescription, Done executives had discussed firing her because she didn't have a supervising physician, a requirement in California, according to company emails viewed by the Journal. Ms. Rahimi said Done had promised to provide one.</p><p>The company cut ties with Ms. Rahimi two days after the renewal call with Mr. Band.</p><p>Done's internal report later concluded that Ms. Rahimi, who didn't hold a psychiatric mental-health credential, had been \"less qualified to diagnose and manage ADHD.\"</p><p>'Is everything ok?'</p><p>At the time, Mr. Band and three housemates from the sober-living facility, including Mr. Walker, had just moved to a rented house in a gated community in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Each had agreed to stay sober. Mr. Band took the master bedroom with a private bathroom.</p><p>Mr. Band's father paid his son's share of the rent. \"I need a quiet space with a desk for school,\" Mr. Band had texted him about getting his own room. \"Love you a lot.\"</p><p>Mr. Band told his family he was excited about spending Thanksgiving at his grandparents' house, a short drive away. Then he said he might be too sick to go. After he stopped answering texts, his parents arranged for a drug test.</p><p>Mr. Walker and Mr. Band's other housemates said they had become suspicious of the time Mr. Band spent alone in his room.</p><p>Two days before Thanksgiving, Mr. Band was back in detox. He left after four days, against medical advice, and told his parents he needed to be at his computer finishing his course work.</p><p>A group of recovering addicts came to Mr. Band's house for dinner on Nov. 30 to say they were pulling for him. </p><p>The home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., where Harlan Band and his housemates moved in November 2020. PHOTO: Rolfe Winkler/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The next day, Mr. Band sent a text to Mr. Walker, who was out of town, and described all the heroin and crack cocaine he had. \"Bro I Bought a half lunar of the best tar I've ever had,\" he wrote. He also recommended Done if Mr. Walker wanted Adderall.</p><p>On Dec. 3, Mr. Walker tried to persuade Mr. Band to return to detox, texting that it was a life-or-death decision. Mr. Band's mother sent her son a text asking why he wasn't answering his phone.</p><p>\"Sorry just in the middle of some shit,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"Is everything ok?\" his mother asked.</p><p>The next day, around 12:40 p.m., Mr. Band's housemates knocked on his door to check on him. When he didn't answer, they picked open the lock and found him leaning out of a chair, seemingly frozen, arms awkwardly folded, dressed in a tank top and shorts.</p><p>The toxicology report listed the drugs found in his body, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine, codeine and various tranquilizers. The cause of death was acute opiate and cocaine intoxication.</p><p>In June, Mr. Band's mother received a Done video advertisement on her Facebook feed. A young actress mimics her parents who mock her for believing she has ADHD. After a plug for the company's 1-minute assessment, she says: \"Wow, seems like I should check out Done.\"</p><p>Joseph Walker contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Rolfe Winkler at rolfe.winkler@wsj.com</p><p>Harlan Band's Descent Started with an Easy Online Adderall Prescription</p>",
