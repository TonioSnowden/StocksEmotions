  "text": "<p>What the heck in the what? you ask.</p><p>I know. It needs explaining. Let's do it.</p><p>First: cyclocross. It's like if road cycling and mountain biking had a baby, bathed it in mud, and taught it to bunny hop over stuff. Riders pedal over grass, dirt, sand, rocks, pavement and really anything you want to throw at them.</p><p>If they can't ride it, they have got to jump off, pick up their bike, sling it over a shoulder, and run. Usually, there's a giant staircase, just for fun.</p><p>Weird, right? Cyclocross embraces its weirdness. It's maybe the only sport on the planet in which athletes and fans pray for rain or snow, so the racecourse is a muddy mess. The throngs of leg-shaven and non-leg-shaven lunatics who come to watch it expect beer tents, Belgian waffles and plenty of cowbells to raise mayhem alongside the course.</p><p>\"A backyard barbecue where a bike race broke out,\" says Brendan Quirk, the recently-named CEO of USA Cycling. \"It's pandemonium.\"</p><p>Now the biggest race of the 'cross calendar is headed to Quirk's home state and the city of Fayetteville. For a small sport in the U.S., it's a big deal.</p><p>\"It definitely feels special,\" says Clara Honsinger, a 24-year-old racer from Ashland, Oregon who is the reigning U.S. champion and a top contender this weekend. \"Home turf…I feel really excited.\"</p><p>Cyclocross worlds have only happened in the U.S. once before—in Louisville in 2013. Why Arkansas? Because the northwest corner of the state has been building a cycling fantasyland of paths for mountain bikers, gravel nuts, and road cyclists, as well as kids and adults who simply want to pedal casually from A to B.</p><p>Bikes are a life mission for Arkansans like Quirk, as well as Bentonville, Ark.'s Tom and Steuart Walton, brothers and cycling obsessives who are, yes, part of the Walton family of Walmart fame.</p><p>Tom Walton says the organizers thought \"landing an event like this would set us up for what we want to become in the future: A place that holds world-class bike races across all disciplines.\"</p><p>Walton thinks Fayetteville is ready.</p><p>\"I feel good about the amount of cowbells,\" Walton says.</p><p>The road to Saturday's elite women's final and Sunday's elite men's final hasn't always been smooth. The pandemic presented volatile obstacles for planning and travel.</p><p>Then, last spring, Arkansas passed laws limiting transgender rights and banning transgender youth from receiving \"gender-affirming\" healthcare—legislation which riled cyclists on social media as discriminatory and prompted chatter about boycotts. Tom Walton issued a statement on behalf of the Walton Family Foundation, which read in part: \"We are alarmed by the string of policy targeting LGBTQ people in Arkansas. This trend is harmful and sends the wrong message to those willing to invest in or visit our state.\"</p><p>\"That's how I felt,\" Walton says now. \"It was just a moment in time where it was worthwhile to speak up given my interest in cycling and my belief that communities, if they're not inclusive, and don't embrace diversity, are just going to crumble.\"</p><p>The ACLU sued, and in the summer, a federal judge put a temporary halt to the healthcare law. But the conversation has continued around the Fayetteville cycling scene, says Molly Cameron, a veteran racer and transgender athlete from Portland, Ore., who's made multiple trips to Arkansas doing outreach through her organization called RIDE: Riders Inspiring Diversity and Equality.</p><p>\"People joke: 'Are you moving here?' And I'm like, no, but there's work,\" Cameron says. \"It's important to have face time and be available.\"</p><p>Cameron will be on-site this weekend, watching the race and selling wristbands to benefit RIDE. As for how the pro riders will fare, Cameron says: \"This course is about raw watts and power. I think this will come down to a test of athletic ability over luck and skill.\"</p><p>Recently, two of the best men's racers, Belgium's Wout van Aert and defending world champion Mathieu van der Poel of the Netherlands, opted out of the race—van der Poel with injury, van Aert to focus on his training for the upcoming road racing season.</p><p>But plenty of stars remain in the field, among them Olympic men's mountain biking champion Tom Pidcock of Great Britain, and cyclocross world cup champ Eli Iserbyt of Belgium.</p><p>The women's field contains names like Honsinger, world cup champion Lucinda Brand, and the one and only Marianne Vos, the legendary Dutch multi-discipline rider who has seven cyclocross world titles to her name.</p><p>\"Marianne's been doing this since she was 19,\" says Tim Johnson, the retired former U.S. champion who will be part of the coverage team on the GCN+ streaming service. \"For her to go for eight world titles, with a legit chance, is huge.\"</p><p>As for Saturday and Sunday's weather…it's really the only mild bummer. High 50s. Sunny.</p><p>It's going to be an absolutely beautiful weekend in northwest Arkansas, which makes a cyclocross fan like Tom Walton chuckle.</p><p>\"It'll be nice temps for socializing and watching the race, but I think all of us, deep down inside, wish that it was snowing and 32,\" he says.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Who's your pick to win the men's and women's world cyclocross titles?</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>A Cycling Super Bowl Rolls into Razorback Country</p>",
