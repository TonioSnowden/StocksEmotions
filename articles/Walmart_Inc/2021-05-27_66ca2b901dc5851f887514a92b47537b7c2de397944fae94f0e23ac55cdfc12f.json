  "text": "<p>It's an old journalistic trope to say that one example is an outlier, two is a coincidence and three is a trend. By extension, 91 is a manifesto.</p> <p>Vectura on Wednesday added its name to the growing list of private equity-backed takeovers of UK companies, with Carlyle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3f7d7d2-316f-4c01-a795-fe99aa1539cd\">agreeing to take the inhaler maker private</a> for nearly £1bn. Its takeover puts a cap on the busiest start to the year for financially backed bids since 2012: Dealogic's year-to-date data show 91 deals completed or pending, about 15 per cent above the long-term run rate, with a total value of nearly £19bn.</p> <p>Buyouts of familiar names such as pub landlord Marston's, Asda and security contractor G4S have mobilised the Daily Mail. The self-appointed conscience of middle England this week published an <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/uk/daily-mail/20210526/281629603179675\">eight point manifesto</a> to protect corporate Britain from “City plunderers”, proposing measures including a ban on debt-funded dividends and an industry register from which bankers can be struck off. In support of its campaign were articles such as “<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9614377/Ten-deals-make-blood-boil-private-equity-barons-wrought-havoc-British-buy-ups.html\">Ten deals to make your blood boil</a>” (none of which involved DMG Ventures, the private equity division of Daily Mail publisher DMGT).</p> <p>Criticism of UK public-to-private buyouts tends to be pinned on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fd92a0c-437d-11dc-a065-0000779fd2ac\">Debenhams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3a00785-5591-4b9d-8e7d-328c822eccb8\">AA</a> deals nearly two decades ago. Their subsequent unravellings are held up as typical examples of the playbook, which takes businesses with stable cash flows and loads on debt that shareholders would never tolerate. </p> <p>It's a gambit that works because interest payments are tax deductible and, so long as the business grows, the extra leverage acts as a turbocharger to the return on equity. There's also a well-publicised potential to hole out the balance sheet and reduce once robust businesses to husks. Given that risk, regulation that adds some steel to the Private Equity Reporting Group's voluntary code of conduct is an idea worth consideration. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it's worth pausing to look at the conditions that created the current deal glut.</p> <p>The UK market sits at a persistent discount to G20 peers that can't be fully explained by its relatively pedestrian corporate earnings growth, nor by the FTSE indices' surfeit of dull financial and consumer staples companies. Panmure Gordon economist Simon French estimates that, even after adjusting for these handicaps, UK public companies are between 10 and 15 per cent undervalued against international equivalents. </p> <p>Britain's discount in part reflects a reluctance among global investors to bet on UK domestic stocks during the chaos that followed the 2016 Brexit vote. The Conservative general election landslide in December 2019 had cleared the outlook only for Covid to sweep in a few months later. Now, with Westminster regime change still a long-odds possibility and economic recovery gathering pace, private equity houses are using loose financial conditions to seize on the valuation anomalies faster than public markets. </p> <p>Rather than a feeding frenzy among pandemic-battered businesses, the data hints at a release of pent-up demand within a narrowing window to act. Earlier in the year buyers were racing to complete deals on fears of tax hikes on capital gains and carried interest in the government's March budget. Though the concern proved unwarranted it has now shifted to the August spending review.</p> <p>And it's not as if private equity has been running the show. Dealogic data show 831 UK target takeovers across all categories so far this year with a total value of £96bn. That's up 16 per cent by deal count and more than 40 per cent by value from the same point in 2020. In the years since the Brexit vote only 2018 had a higher deal value by late May, when a slumping pound helped seal the fate of FTSE 100 members including broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6d93972-b5e9-11e8-b3ef-799c8613f4a1\">Sky</a> and drugmaker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5cd0606-12da-11e9-a581-4ff78404524e\">Shire</a>. </p> <p>There's no easy answer to whether private equity's ruthless targeting of medium-term returns is better or worse for the nation than the often disengaged short-termism that comes with shareholder ownership. Both sides have their arguments <a href=\"https://www.bvca.co.uk/media-and-publications/news/bvca-press-releases/details/The-private-equity-and-venture-capital-industry-creating-public-value-for-the-United-Kingdom\">well practised</a>. What's clearer is that the drivers of this year's deal boom are unlikely to last. For all the clamour, politicians should feel no greater urgency to legislate. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Private equity's UK shopping spree is not yet a reason to panic' FT.com 27 May.
