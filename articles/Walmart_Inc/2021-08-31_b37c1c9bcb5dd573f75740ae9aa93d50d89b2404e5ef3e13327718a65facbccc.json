  "title": "Hurricane Ida Leaves Residents Without Power Amid Punishing Heat; Louisiana schools closed, hospitals operating on generators with power outages expected to last up to a month",
  "text": "<p>Roads are blocked, stores are closed and the heat is punishing, with the National Weather Service issuing a heat advisory Tuesday for southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, predicting a heat index of 105 degrees.</p><p>More than 20,000 lineworkers are repairing the electricity grid, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Tuesday. The governor said he is in regular communication with power providers, pressing them to restore electricity as quickly as possible.</p><p>\"I'm worried about it because that's how we run our hospitals, too, and our hospitals are full,\" he said, in a Tuesday news conference. \"We have so many other things that are just critically important.\"</p><p>He urged people who had evacuated to stay put for now, not just because of the lack of air-conditioning and other comforts.</p><p>Ida has killed at least four people. Two people died late Monday in coastal Mississippi after driving into a massive sinkhole after a highway collapsed, according to the state's Highway Patrol. Another 10 people were injured, 3 critically.</p><p>In Louisiana, one person was killed by a fallen tree, and another drowned while driving through floodwaters.</p><p>The St. Tammany Parish sheriff's office said it is investigating a possible fatal alligator attack related to the storm, after a woman in Slidell said her husband was attacked and apparently killed while wading in floodwaters.</p><p>Ida made landfall Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane near Port Fourchon, La., south of New Orleans. Winds topped 150 miles an hour, sending more than 20 barges loose in the Mississippi River, toppling an electricity tower and downing cypress and live oak trees.</p><p>Ida arrived on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the region. Since Katrina, a $14.5 billion flood-protection system—including flood walls, levees, canals and barriers constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—has helped bolster storm defenses around New Orleans. The area surrounded by the flood-protection system seemed to flood far less than the suburbs outside it.</p><p>Officials said Monday they were pleased that the system appears to be working as intended but cautioned that flooding could continue to pose a threat.</p><p>Roughly 582,000 people safely and smoothly evacuated from New Orleans and the surrounding parishes in the three days before the storm, according to a tweet from Shawn Wilson, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Transportation, who cited an analysis of cellphone and other auto technology ping data. It isn't clear how many people rode out the storm—the metro population is about 1 million, according to the Census.</p><p>Many people who stayed in town wandered the streets Tuesday, seeking out ice, food and cash, as credit cards were unusable. The ice had melted, restaurants were closed and many ATMs were drained. The weather was muggy with little wind, and mosquitoes were suddenly prevalent after being scarce during the storm.</p><p>The city of New Orleans shared on social media a list of closed stores, including a Costco and all Walmart locations. A much smaller list had a few neighborhood stores with limited staffing, capacity and supplies. Six of the region's dozens of dialysis centers were set to open Tuesday, subject to water and sewer supply, the city said.</p><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency said more than 3,600 employees were deployed to Louisiana, Mississippi and neighboring states to support relief efforts. Thirteen urban search and rescue teams were deployed in Louisiana, and Army Corps of Engineers power-restoration teams were mobilized to conduct assessments. Supplies including 3.4 million meals, 2.4 million liters of water and 35,700 tarps were pre-positioned in the region ahead of the storm.</p><p>The Louisiana National Guard has more than 5,100 service members activated and, with the help of high-water vehicles, boats and helicopters, was conducting search-and-rescue operations. As of Tuesday morning, that effort rescued 359 people across five parishes. Trucks stocked with food and supplies were staged in Tangipahoa Parish, north of New Orleans, and the National Guard planned to set up at least nine distribution sites on Tuesday in affected areas.</p><p>Jane Norwood, a city nurse, trolled in vain for food late Monday at restaurants she had heard were open. That sometimes meant driving on sidewalks to thwart power lines and fallen trees. The last place she tried was New York Pizza—on the city's Magazine Street corridor—which had already closed after selling out. She gave up and ate some processed cheese slices in the car.</p><p>\"I had just been craving anything hot, like fried mozzarella sticks,\" she said.</p><p>Analytics firm CoreLogic Inc. estimated that 515,952 homes were affected by Ida's winds, compared with Hurricane Katrina, which affected 792,824 homes. This may partly be because the storm hit a less populated area than Katrina, according to the firm.</p><p>There were more than one million people without power in Louisiana and roughly 50,000 in Mississippi on Tuesday, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks outage reports from utilities. Service outages at 911 centers persisted, though New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell tweeted Monday that 911 service had been restored in the city.</p><p>More than 650,000 customers in Louisiana lacked water as of 10 a.m. Tuesday, and another 300,000 were under boil-water advisories, according to the Louisiana Department of Health. About 3,000 customers in coastal Mississippi had boil-water alerts, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.</p><p>In New Orleans, nearly all sewer pumping stations lost power, creating the potential for backups, according to the city's Sewerage and Water Board. The utility relied on generators to start powering the stations back up, and meanwhile, it asked residents to limit water usage.</p><p>Officials are warning residents of Jefferson Parish, which encompasses suburbs like Metairie and Gretna west and south of New Orleans, that it could be 21 days before power is restored. They also say it could be five days until the water and sewer system is up and running again, prompting many residents who rode out the storm to pack up and leave, some to stay with family members out of state and others in search of hotel rooms hours from the city. Traffic on Interstates 10 and 59 east of the city was predominantly one way, with vehicles of people fleeing the city, some with gas tanks, clothing and children's bikes strapped to the back.</p><p>Entergy Corp., the region's dominant power provider, said high winds took down 207 transmission lines, the high-voltage conduits that carry electricity from power plants to substations that connect to lower-voltage distribution lines. The damage is complex and widespread, making it difficult to predict how soon power might be restored, company officials said.</p><p>Parents and students braced for school closures of weeks to months. Officials at Tulane University, in the heart of New Orleans, said they planned to load any remaining students on Tuesday morning onto buses for Houston, more than a five-hour drive away. The university is closed until at least Sept. 12, according to the school website.</p><p>Many roads were blocked by fallen debris, and Interstate 10, a major east-west thoroughfare, was restricted to emergency responders only on Tuesday between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.</p><p>Hospitals have already been strained by a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. Ochsner Health hospital system had evacuated or was moving 65 patients from two Louisiana hospitals in Raceland and Houma, executives said Monday, citing roof damage and water leaks.</p><p>The storm also disrupted the tourism industry for the foreseeable future in a town dependent on it.</p><p>Ty Fuller, 55 years old and a registered nurse from Lawrence, Kansas, had rented a house in the French Quarter through Vrbo for a week with five family members. \"This sure isn't what we expected,\" he said. Three members of the party were able to get out by renting a U-Haul, but he and two of his sons were stranded. \"We were not able to get out before the storm,\" he said. \"All the flights were closed and all the rental cars were gone.\"</p><p>Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Rachel Wolfe at rachel.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>Hurricane Ida Leaves Residents Without Power Amid Punishing Heat</p>",
