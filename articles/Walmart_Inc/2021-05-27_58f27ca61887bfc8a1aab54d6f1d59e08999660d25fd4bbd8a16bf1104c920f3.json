  "title": "Business News:  Walmart to Sell New Line of Gap-Branded Goods  ----  By Sarah Nassauer and Suzanne Kapner",
  "text": "<p>    Walmart Inc. and Gap Inc. plan to partner on a line of Gap-branded homegoods that will be sold at Walmart stores,  a sign of how each retailer is stretching into new territory to stay competitive. </p><p>   Gap Home, which will include items such as bedding and pillows, will go on sale June 24, the companies said. . </p><p>   The line of home items will be called Gap Home and go on sale later this year, say some of these people. </p><p>   In recent years, Walmart has worked to expand its apparel and homegoods selection to include brands perceived as higher end, part of its efforts to appeal to a wider customer base and boost online sales. The retail behemoth earlier this year named fashion designer Brandon Maxwell as creative director of Free Assembly and Scoop, private-label brands that Walmart says are part of its \"elevated fashion brands.\" This month, Walmart said it would acquire ZeekIt, which allows digital shoppers to see how clothes might look on their bodies or models with similar bodies. </p><p>   Gap, which has been working to revive its namesake brand, doesn't currently sell homegoods and has never sold its branded items inside Walmart. </p><p>   Gap signed a deal last year with licensing company IMG that will allow it to expand into home decor, furniture, textiles and other categories. The agreement also includes Gap's Banana Republic brand. Gap Home will be developed in partnership with IMG, the companies said Wednesday. </p><p>   Gap had reported a string of weak sales in recent years and struggled throughout the pandemic as spending gravitated away from apparel. But it has made improvements under new Chief Executive Sonia Syngal and reported positive same-store sales in North America in the fourth quarter for the Gap brand. The company reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. </p><p></p>",
