  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 271 points, or 0.9%, to 30,982.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 33 points, or 0.9%, to 3,867.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP shed 112 points, or 1%, to trade at 11,278.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow industrials and S&amp;P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Dow finished more than 15% below its Jan. 4 record finish, while the S&amp;P 500 ended 18.7% below its Jan. 3 record —- not far off the 20% threshold that marks a bear market.</p><p>Read: Selloff puts S&amp;P 500 on bear market's doorstep. If history is a guide, there's more pain ahead.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>Wall Street initially took a cue from a strong Asian session, where the Hong Kong Hang Seng HK:HSI rallied 2.9% and the China CSI 300 index XX:000300 gained 1.9%.</p><p>The People's Bank of China on Friday cut in its rate on five-year loans, aimed at shoring up weak housing sales by cutting mortgage costs. The country has been battling COVID outbreaks, with lockdowns in industrial hubs such as Shanghai blamed for weak factory and consumer activity data in April.</p><p>But the gains proved fragile.</p><p>\"Stocks remain on a shaky footing. Investors' list of worries grows ever larger,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with City Index and Forex.com, in a note.</p><p>\"Inflation. Interest-rate hikes. Low economic growth. Stagflation. Recession. Perhaps most importantly for stocks, the Fed is not there to provide cushion, like before,\" he wrote.</p><p>Some market watchers, however, contend the damage done so far leaves markets due to stabilize and perhaps bounce.</p><p>\"The news out of China and the successful test of the S&amp;P 500 holding support is poised to pull the index out of the danger zone. We reiterate; for now, we think the market has placed in a bottom,\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital, told clients in a note.</p><p>He noted the index came close to that support level of 3,850 on Thursday, but didn't get there. The S&amp;P 500 saw a session low below 3,870 in Friday morning trade.</p><p>Friday is the final day of trading before the expiration of options tied to stocks and exchange-traded funds, which is seen potentially contributing to volatility ahead of the end of the session.</p><p>Major U.S. stock indexes remain on track for another week of losses. The Dow is set for its eighth straight weekly decline, which would be its longest since April 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were on track for a seventh straight weekly fall, the longest streak for each since 2001. Losses have come amid concerns about whether soaring inflation can be brought under control by the Federal Reserve without derailing the economy.</p><p>Major retailers this week, such as Walmart WMTand Target TGT reported disappointing profits, against a backdrop of rising expenses and inflation.</p><p>Mark Hulbert: Here's the real reason the stock market is coming unglued — and it isn't because of weak earnings</p><p>\"Stock markets are attempting to continue their stabilization on optimism that China will be able to ease its COVID-19 lockdown measures and hopes that the rise in bond yields has come to an end for the time being, with indications of a peak in U.S. inflation rates,\" said Christian Stocker, lead equity sector strategist at UniCredit Bank in Munich.</p><p>This past week, however, has shown that the risk of economic downturn, fears that high inflation is cutting into corporate performance and rising borrowing costs remain the major worry for markets, he wrote, particularly after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank \"won't hesitate\" to lift rates beyond neutral to curb high inflation.</p><p>\"In this environment, investor sentiment is fickle and markets are likely to remain choppy to both sides until there is greater clarity in terms of recession, rates, and geopolitical risks,\" Stocker said.</p><p>The U.S. economic data calendar is empty for Friday, but next week will bring another round of inflation data, personal consumption expenditure prices excluding food and energy.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of Ross Stores Inc. ROST slumped nearly 22% after the retailer became the latest to report disappointing quarterly results and trim its outlook, blaming higher inflation and rising freight and wage costs.</p><p>* Deere &amp; Co. DE shares slipped nearly 11% after the agriculture, construction and forestry equipment maker reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue.</p><p>* Applied Materials Inc. AMAT stock was down 2.2% after the chip-equipment maker reported a miss on profit, revenue and forecast amid continued supply chain woes.</p><p>* Foot Locker FL, the athletic footwear and apparel retailer, saw its shares rise more than 4% after it reported first-quarter profit that beat expectations.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>* The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y edged down 02 basis points to 2.833%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>* The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY rose 0.3%, but was on track for a 1.5% weekly fall as it pulled back from a roughly 20-year high set last week.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD was off 1.6% near $29,900.</p><p>* Oil futures rose, with the U.S. benchmark CL.1 up 0.2% near $110 a barrel. Gold futures GC00 were down 0.3% near $1,835 an ounce.</p><p>* The Stoxx Europe 600 XX:SXXP rose 1.2%, while London's FTSE 100 UK:UKX rose 1.7%.</p><p>Stocks erase early bounce, with Dow set for longest losing streak since 1932</p>",
