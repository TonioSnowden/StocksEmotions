  "title": "Levi Strauss Uses More Frequent Financial Forecasts to Confront Uncertainty; The denim company is submitting half-year financial goals to its board instead of annual ones",
  "text": "<p>The more frequent forecasting cadence is helping Levi Strauss prepare for a potential economic slowdown, new phases of the pandemic and any unforeseen geopolitical events, Mr. Singh said. \"The reason it's important is because you don't have a real line of sight in the future. Things are so uncertain,\" he said, adding that he intends to submit his plan for the second half of the year this week.</p><p>Levi Strauss last week said revenue during the quarter ended May 29 increased 15%, to $1.47 billion. Demand for denim has been strong as people return to work in more casual clothing and replenish their wardrobes with newer styles, Mr. Singh said. The company last month set a five-year financial goal of achieving annual net revenue growth of between 6% and 8% through fiscal 2027.</p><p>Net income during the quarter fell 23% from a year earlier, to $49.7 million, due in part to a $60 million charge stemming from the temporary suspension of operations in Russia. Levi is working through its long-term plans for its Russian operations, and expects more clarity on the matter in the next couple of months, Mr. Singh said.</p><p>Demand for Levi's lowest-priced denim declined during the quarter, as some inflation-weary consumers pulled back on spending, analysts said. Demand for the company's Denizen and Signature products—which sell for between $20 and $30 at retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp.—declined by the mid-single digits from a year earlier, Levi's said. Those two brands accounted for 8% of the company's net revenue in the 2021 fiscal year.</p><p>Outside of its lowest-priced categories, however, Levi isn't seeing signs of a pullback in spending, Mr. Singh said. \"The state of the consumer continues to be strong,\" he said.</p><p>Levi has raised prices to offset the impact of higher costs, including for cotton which is used to make denim. Higher sale prices so far haven't dented demand, Mr. Singh said.</p><p>During the quarter, inventories—a focus in the industry as retailers grapple with excess stock—increased 29% to $1.1 billion. Approximately two-thirds of Levi's inventory is made up of core products that aren't tied to a particular season, the company said. The company's acquisition of athleisure wear brand Beyond Yoga in 2021, as well as the purchase of operations in Thailand that were previously licensed, also bolstered inventory levels.</p><p>Analysts said the company's inventory levels, while rising, are doing so in line with expectations for strong demand. Women are buying more wider-leg jeans instead of skinny-leg styles, and the company's classic 501 jeans category is showing strong growth, analysts and the company said.</p><p>In the months ahead, a new enterprise resource planning system will likely provide Levi with better visibility into where its inventory is located and how well stores are stocked, said Jay Sole, an analyst with UBS Group AG.</p><p>Approximately 20% of the company's inventory is in transit, meaning it hasn't arrived at its facilities yet. \"If it's on its way, it's against future orders and future seasons,\" Mr. Singh said.</p><p>Write to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com</p><p>Levi Strauss Uses More Frequent Financial Forecasts to Confront Uncertainty</p>",
