  "title": "Slump Sends S&P 500 Near Bear Territory --- Benchmark is down over 18% from high amid fear of recession; Treasury yield slips",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 lost 22.89 points, or 0.6%, to 3900.79, coming close to bear-market territory -- or a 20% fall from a recent high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 236.94 points, or 0.8%, to 31253.13. Both indexes closed at their lowest level since March 2021.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index, which entered bear-market territory earlier this year, retreated 29.66 points, or 0.3%, to 11388.50.</p><p>Investors bought government bonds, perceived as a haven asset in times of economic uncertainty. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.854% from 2.884% on Wednesday, losing ground for seven of the past nine trading days. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Earnings reports from some of the U.S.'s biggest retailers in recent days have added to concern that the highest rate of inflation in four decades is catching up with U.S. consumers and sending the economy toward a recession.</p><p>Investors were already grappling with the end of an era of loose monetary policy that stoked big gains for stocks and other riskier assets. The combination of factors has recently fed into steep losses for stocks and some corporate bonds, and many investors expect the volatility to continue.</p><p>\"The price action suggests it isn't over,\" said Philip Saunders, a portfolio manager at Ninety One, an asset manager based in the U.K. and South Africa.</p><p>Kohl's Corp. shares gained $1.91, or 4.4%, to $45.04, after executives said suitors remained interested in buying the company and reported sales weakened in April, making it the latest retailer to point to inflationary pressures on demand. Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. said this week that higher costs ate into profits in the latest quarter, leading to a selloff of their shares that rippled through the broader market.</p><p>Cisco Systems Inc. declined $6.64, or 14%, to $41.72 after the communication-equipment firm missed analyst expectations for its quarterly results. BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. said gasoline sales boosted revenue and profit in its first quarter, sending shares up more than $3.97, or 7.4%, to $57.39.</p><p>Anthony Saglimbene, global markets strategist at Ameriprise Financial, said economic data point to healthy consumer spending, allaying fears of a recession.</p><p>\"For consumers to really retrench spending, they have to fear that they're going to lose their jobs and that's just not the environment we're in,\" Mr. Saglimbene said.</p><p>Some analysts, however, said a slowdown in consumer spending could mean the Federal Reserve wouldn't have to raise interest rates as aggressively to lower consumer demand.</p><p>\"Some amount of slowdown in discretionary spending will help organically or naturally ease the supply-chain constraints,\" said Seth Wunder, Acorns' chief investment officer. \"At the end of the day, that is one of the largest inputs to the inflationary issues we're facing.\"</p><p>The war in Ukraine is adding to the inflationary pressures prompting the Fed to embark on a series of interest-rate rises and to reduce its bondholdings. And Covid-19 shutdowns in China have led to a sharp slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. Some investors said that higher interest rates ahead will normalize return expectations among investors.</p><p>\"We're going through a recalibration process and that's a good thing,\" said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist of The Private Bank at Union Bank. \"In the short run it will be painful, but sometimes you need short-term pain to recondition behavior.\"</p><p>The last time the S&amp;P 500 fell into a bear market was during the pandemic panic in March 2020. It was short-lived, and the market quickly embarked on a two-year rally that peaked this Jan. 3. The Dow industrials, which are more weighted to old-line industrial companies and banking stocks, have performed less badly and are still some way from bear-market territory.</p><p>\"Throw monetary-policy tightening into the mix, we've got a recipe for volatility and investor jitteriness,\" said Clara Cheong, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>Global oil benchmark Brent crude gained $2.93 per barrel, or 2.7%, to $112.04 a barrel. In cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin added 3.5% from its 5 p.m. ET level on Wednesday to trade at $30,213.64, up for the past three out of five days.</p><p>International stocks retreated. The Stoxx Europe 600 shed 1.4%, led lower by shares of financial-services and food-and-beverage companies. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 2.5% Thursday, but was up 1.9% at midday Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 1.2% at midday Friday, a day after dropping 1.9%. South Korea's Kospi Composite had gained 1.7%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
