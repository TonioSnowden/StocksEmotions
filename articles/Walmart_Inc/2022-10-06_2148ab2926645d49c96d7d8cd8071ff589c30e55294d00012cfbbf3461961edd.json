  "text": "<p>Levi operates its own stores and sells its products through larger retailers such as Macy's Inc., Target Corp. and Walmart Inc.</p><p>The jeans maker said supply-chain disruptions, primarily in the U.S., caused missed sales of roughly $30 million to $40 million.</p><p>Chief Executive Chip Bergh said the company expects the macroeconomic environment to remain unpredictable over the next few quarters, leading the company to lower its full-year guidance.</p><p>Levi's results come as a range of apparel retailers face falling sales as consumers shift their spending away from clothing and other discretionary items. That has forced some retailers to step up discounts to clear through excess inventory.</p><p>Retailers such as Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. lowered their sales targets for the year in late August, and Gap Inc. withdrew its guidance as it works to reduce inventory to match consumer demand and reduce operating costs.</p><p>Levi plans to control discretionary spending while it continues to navigate a difficult operating environment, Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh said.</p><p>Levi's inventories rose 43% in the third quarter from a year earlier. The company said the increase was primarily due to inflation for costs of goods sold and pulling inventory forward to sidestep supply-chain risks.</p><p>For the quarter ended Aug. 28, Levi posted earnings of $173 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $193 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings were 40 cents, ahead of analysts' expectations of 37 cents.</p><p>Levi Posts Small Sales Increase Amid Supply-Chain Challenges</p>",
