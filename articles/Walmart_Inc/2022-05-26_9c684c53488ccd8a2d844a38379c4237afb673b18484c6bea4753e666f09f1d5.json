  "title": "Dollar General, Dollar Tree Stores Show Strength in Face of Inflation; Discount retail chains beat expectations for weaker quarterly sales and predict stronger sales for year",
  "text": "<p>At Dollar Tree, same-store sales, or those from stores operating for at least 12 months, rose 4.4% during the quarter ended April 30, after the company broadly raised prices above $1 per item. Profits also rose and the company raised sales and earnings estimates for the full year.</p><p>Dollar General said same-store sales decreased 0.1% as fewer shoppers visited its locations in the April-ended period. Quarterly profits came in ahead of expectations, however, and the company raised its annual forecast for growth in same-store sales.</p><p>Shares of Dollar General rose 12% in trading Thursday afternoon, while Dollar Tree shares jumped 19%. Both stocks had slumped in recent days amid mixed quarterly results from retail companies.</p><p>Last week big-box competitors including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. reported weaker profits due to higher supply chain, wage and inflation-related costs, which led to big stock declines. Executives at the dollar chains said they see many of the same cost pressures, but sales gains and operational choices have helped mitigate those costs.</p><p>\"Despite these challenges we remained focused on controlling what we can control,\" Dollar General Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said on a call with analysts Thursday.</p><p>Dollar chains, which often sell lower priced items in small packages, tend to see sales rise when the economy weakens. Consumer spending is healthy due to continued strong employment numbers, Mr. Vasos said, but behavior is changing as prices rise for everyday goods such as gas.</p><p>Dollar General's core shoppers, those from households that earn around $40,000 a year, are coming in more often and buying less in recent weeks, he said. \"That would tell you that she's trying to make ends meet,\" Mr. Vasos said of the typical customer. Higher income shoppers or those looking to burn less gas by shopping closer to home are also visiting more often, he said.</p><p>Dollar General, which has a more rural store base than Dollar Tree, is laying the groundwork to further benefit from cash-strapped shoppers, Mr. Vasos said. The company plans to add more $1 price items to shelves and highlight its private brand goods during the second half of the year, he said.</p><p>The company said it expects same-store sales to rise 3% to 3.5% for the year, up from a previous forecast of 2.5% growth. Dollar General plans to open over 1,000 new stores this year, adding to its current fleet of around 18,300 U.S. stores. Its profits fell</p><p>Dollar Tree, which owns both the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree chains, raised prices at its Dollar Tree brand to $1.25. Sales at that brand rose 11.2% in the latest quarter due to the increase. Previously, it sold mostly $1 items unlike other chains.</p><p>At Family Dollar, same-store sales declined 2.8%. That included the temporary closure of around 400 stores after an Arkansas distribution center was shut due to rodent infestation. The company has permanently closed that warehouse, executives said Thursday.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Dollar General, Dollar Tree Stores Show Strength in Face of Inflation</p>",
