  "text": "<p>The US has launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/565160c7-b5e0-4750-858a-37224bf3db0c\">a new trilateral security partnership</a> with the UK and Australia that will enable Canberra to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, a move that will strengthen the allies' ability to counter China.</p> <p>President Joe Biden announced the effort, which is designed to bolster alliances amid rising tensions with Beijing over disputes ranging from the South China Sea to Taiwan, in a virtual event yesterday with British prime minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison.</p> <p>Biden said the initiative was necessary to ensure the countries had the best technology to “defend against rapidly evolving threats”, in rhetoric that appeared to be aimed at Beijing.</p> <p>Morrison said it was a “forever partnership . . . between the oldest and most trusted of friends”. The pact, also known as AUSUK, “represents a substantial capability leap for the Royal Australian Navy”, the Australian government said. Read more on how the agreement will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e2dafe6-0249-4aea-9c69-b21667b85063\">allow Australia to project power across the western Pacific</a>.</p> <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the move. “They&#xa0;should shake off their cold war mentality and ideological prejudice,” said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesperson.&#xa0;</p> <p>But US allies in the region <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c13755c-0c41-42f9-ba72-91cd849d22f7\">welcomed the new agreement</a>. Officials in Taipei, which is on the frontline of tensions between Washington and Beijing, said the alliance would help balance&#xa0;China's growing military strength&#xa0;and assertiveness.</p> <p>“The creation of AUKUS fills the most important gap in the security web of the entire western Pacific,” said one Taiwanese&#xa0;official.</p> <p>Taro Kono, a former Japanese foreign and defence minister and a leading candidate to succeed Yoshihide Suga as prime minister, said: “We very much welcome that the UK is once again turning its eyes to the Pacific region.”</p> <p>As part of the pact, Australia will scrap a programme to buy 12 conventional&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ab37572-0b4a-11e6-b0f1-61f222853ff3\">submarines from France</a>&#xa0;that was signed in 2016. Instead it will procure at least eight nuclear-powered submarines, which are faster, quieter and can operate over longer ranges.</p> <p>France reacted with fury at Canberra's decision to cancel the $90bn deal with Paris. “This decision is contrary to the letter and spirit of the co-operation that prevailed between France and Australia,” said Jean-Yves Le Drian, French foreign minister, and defence minister Florence Parly.</p> <p><em>What are your thoughts?
