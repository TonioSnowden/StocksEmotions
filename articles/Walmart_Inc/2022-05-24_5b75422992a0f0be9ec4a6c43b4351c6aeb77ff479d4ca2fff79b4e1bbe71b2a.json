  "text": "<p>Best Buy reported earnings of $341 million for the quarter ended April 30, compared with $595 million a year earlier. The company's revenue for the quarter fell roughly $1 billion from the previous year to $10.6 billion. Comparable sales dropped 8%, compared with a rise of 37% in the quarter a year ago.</p><p>The company hadn't released guidance for the first quarter but did say after the holiday quarter that it expected sales to fall in fiscal 2023, the retailer's current year.</p><p>On Tuesday, Best Buy said revenue for the year would now be between $48.3 billion and $49.9 billion, cut from its March forecast of $49.3 billion to $50.8 billion. Comparable sales are now expected to decline 3% to 6%, compared with the prior guidance of a decline of 1% to 4%.</p><p>Best Buy's first-quarter sales didn't drop as much as Wall Street had expected, but profits came in below some expectations. Adjusted earnings were $1.57 a share for the quarter, compared with expectations of $1.60 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Shares of Best Buy, which had fallen more than 35% so far this year, slipped 3% in premarket trading.</p><p>Retailers have posted mixed results for the first quarter as companies have battled higher freight and labor costs as well as changing consumer habits.

The apparel retailer warned it expected higher costs for the remainder of the year and forecast slower sales growth. Shares in the company tumbled 25% in premarket trading.</p><p>Meanwhile, Petco Health and Wellness Co. booked a higher first-quarter profit as comparable sales increased 5.1% from year-ago levels. Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said consumer spending on pets, which grew rapidly during the pandemic, has continued to surge.
