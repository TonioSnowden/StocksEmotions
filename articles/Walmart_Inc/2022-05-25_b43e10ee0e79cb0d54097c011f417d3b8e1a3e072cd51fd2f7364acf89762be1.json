  "title": "Business News:  Walmart Expanding Use  Of Drones for Deliveries  ----  By Will Feuer",
  "text": "<p>   Walmart Inc. is expanding its drone delivery operations to some 4 million households in six states, as the big-box retailer looks to add speedy delivery to compete in the nascent space with the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and FedEx Corp. </p><p>   Walmart said Tuesday it will be able to deliver more than 1 million packages by drone a year in as little as 30 minutes to households in parts of Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Utah and Virginia. The service will have a $3.99 delivery fee per order and can deliver up to 10 pounds at a time. </p><p>   The announcement is an expansion of a partnership with operator DroneUp LLC, which began operating drone-delivery hubs out of Walmart stores in Arkansas in November. Orders are fulfilled from stores, loaded onto the drones and delivered to yards using a cable that lowers the package to the ground. Walmart invested in DroneUp last June. </p><p>   Walmart joins other retailers like Amazon, as well as delivery firms like FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc., to explore delivering items using drones. The companies have for years touted drones as a potential solution to the costly last mile of home deliveries and also to reach rural customers in a more cost-effective way. </p><p>   David Guggina, Walmart's senior vice president of innovation and automation, said that the company has been surprised how customers have been using the drone service so far. They thought most orders would be for emergency supplies. </p><p>   \"We're finding they use it for sheer convenience, like a quick fix for a weeknight meal,\" he wrote in a corporate blog post Tuesday. A top seller at one hub: the boxed meal kit Hamburger Helper. </p><p>   Early commercial applications of drone operations have been limited. UPS's first approval of commercial drone operations involved shipping medical products and specimens across hospital campuses. </p><p>   FedEx's Express unit earlier this year said it was partnering with Elroy Air Inc. on autonomous drone cargo delivery to move shipments between sortation centers. </p><p>   UPS Chief Executive Carol Tome earlier this year said that a broader commercial drone delivery network is still a ways off. \"There are lots of issues with drones. You can't fly them when it's windy, you can't fly them when it's rainy,\" Ms. Tome said at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event in January. \"There will be a time when drones have a bigger role commercially.\" </p><p></p>",
