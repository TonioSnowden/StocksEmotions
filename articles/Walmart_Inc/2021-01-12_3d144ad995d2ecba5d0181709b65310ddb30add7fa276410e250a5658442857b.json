  "text": "<p>   The two largest U.S. chicken producers said they have reached deals with a group of poultry buyers to settle price-fixing claims. </p><p>    Tyson Foods Inc., the biggest U.S. meat company by sales and the nation's top chicken supplier, and Pilgrim's Pride Corp., the second-largest U.S. poultry processor by sales, separately said Monday they struck agreements to help resolve a four-year battle over alleged collusion in the $65 billion U.S. chicken industry. </p><p>   Restaurant chains, supermarket operators and food distributors have accused Tyson, Pilgrim's and other major chicken companies of coordinating production and pricing to boost prices for staples like chicken breasts, tenders and wings. Chicken suppliers in court have pushed back, pointing to economic factors they said drove poultry prices. </p><p>   Last year the Justice Department filed criminal price-fixing and bid-rigging charges against 10 poultry-industry executives, including two former chief executives of Pilgrim's. The defendants have pleaded not guilty. </p><p>   Colorado-based Pilgrim's said Monday that it had agreed to pay $75 million to settle civil claims brought by chicken buyers. Tyson didn't disclose a settlement figure. </p><p>   Both settlements remain subject to court approval, and neither company has admitted to the chicken buyers' claims. </p><p>   The agreements don't cover lawsuits filed separately by individual plaintiffs. Tyson, Pilgrim's and other U.S. chicken suppliers still face lawsuits from some of their top customers, including chicken sandwich giant Chick-fil-A Inc., supermarket operators Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co., and food-service distributors Sysco Corp. and US Foods Holding Corp. </p><p>   Lawyers representing chicken buyers have alleged that Pilgrim's, Tyson, and other top poultry companies like Sanderson Farms Inc. and Perdue Farms Inc. kept tabs on one another's operations through an industry benchmarking service and coordinated submissions to a chicken pricing index in a yearslong effort to keep chicken prices artificially high. </p><p>   The companies have contested the claims, arguing that higher grain costs and growing demand for chicken led to higher prices. An attorney representing chicken buyers in the case declined to comment on Pilgrim's proposed settlement. In prior settlements, several smaller chicken companies agreed to collectively pay about $13 million to the plaintiffs and to cooperate in the litigation. </p><p>   Pilgrim's settlement was announced in a regulatory filing Monday and comes after the company last fall announced a plea deal in the Justice Department's criminal price-fixing case. Under that deal, Pilgrim's agreed to pay a $110.5 million penalty. Pilgrim's reported $11.4 billion in sales for 2019. </p><p>   Tyson has been cooperating in the Justice Department investigation under a corporate leniency program that allows the Arkansas company to avoid criminal prosecution, in exchange for helping the agency's probe. Tyson's settlement agreement was disclosed Monday in a court filing. </p><p>   Tyson shares settled 1% higher and were inactive in after-hours trading. </p><p>   In its criminal probe, the Justice Department has alleged that senior chicken-industry players exchanged details of prices they planned to submit to major fast-food chains, sharing details on competitors' activity through text messages and phone calls. </p><p></p>",
