  "title": "Best Buy Reports Falling Sales, Warns of Tough Year Ahead; Electronics retailer says consumer demand is softer, but it isn't planning for a full recession",
  "text": "<p>Best Buy reported earnings of $341 million for the quarter ended April 30, compared with $595 million a year earlier. The company's revenue for the quarter fell roughly $1 billion from the previous year to $10.6 billion. Comparable sales dropped 8%, compared with a rise of 37% in the quarter a year ago.</p><p>The company hadn't released guidance for the first quarter but did say after the holiday quarter that it expected sales to fall in fiscal 2023, the retailer's current year.</p><p>On Tuesday, Best Buy said revenue for the year would now be between $48.3 billion and $49.9 billion, cut from its March forecast of $49.3 billion to $50.8 billion. Comparable sales are now expected to decline 3% to 6%, compared with the prior guidance of a decline of 1% to 4%.</p><p>Best Buy's first-quarter sales didn't drop as much as Wall Street had expected, but profits came in below some expectations. Adjusted earnings were $1.57 a share for the quarter, compared with expectations of $1.60 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Shares of Best Buy, which had fallen more than 35% so far this year, rose 1.2% in Tuesday trading.</p><p>Retailers have posted mixed results for the first quarter as companies have battled higher freight and labor costs as well as changing consumer habits. Last week, Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. posted weaker-than-expected earnings, and Target executives said people were spending less on goods such as TVs and appliances.</p><p>Appliances have been an area of strength for Best Buy, while sales of home theater and computers fell slightly, Ms. Barry said. Promotions on TVs and computers were higher in the first quarter compared with the prior year.</p><p>Analysis</p><p>* Best Buy Is Best of Breed in Retail's Meltdown</p><p>\"We're seeing some increased signals of concern,\" she said on a call with reporters. \"Consumers are spending more overall, but we're seeing some of those signals that they're shifting some of their spend into experiences, vacations and also more going into the basics because of inflationary pressures.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. swung to a quarterly loss, hurt by higher freight and product costs. The apparel retailer warned it expected higher costs for the remainder of the year and forecast slower sales growth. Shares in the company tumbled 29% in Tuesday's trading.</p><p>Meanwhile, Petco Health and Wellness Co. booked a higher first-quarter profit as comparable sales increased 5.1% from year-ago levels. Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said consumer spending on pets, which grew rapidly during the pandemic, has continued to surge. Shares rose 3.7% on Tuesday.</p><p>After U.S. markets closed, Nordstrom Inc. raised its sales and profit targets for the year after it reported quarterly results. The department-store chain said the return of in-person social events and a travel rebound have boosted demand for clothing. Nordstrom shares rose 11% in after-hours trading.</p><p>Will Feuer contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Charity L.
