  "title": "Cutting Costs, Not Jobs, Is Focus for Many CFOs Facing Slowdown; Companies aim to avoid mass layoffs despite the prospect of a recession",
  "text": "<p>Finance chiefs are looking to squeeze cost savings from their businesses as they brace for a potential recession, but without resorting to layoffs in a challenging hiring environment.</p><p>Many economists expect the U.S. economy tocontract in 2023 following a series of aggressive interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation. At the same time, many employers arelooking for workers, withjob openings well above the number of job seekers.</p><p>That leaves some finance chiefs scouting for savings that don't involve job cuts, or that supplement layoffs, advisers and analysts said. Other ways to cut costs include exiting leases, reducing the number of suppliers, automating tasks, trimming software spending and finding less expensive components, advisers said.</p><p>\"Most CFOs are very reluctant to let staff go in what seems to probably be a pretty mild recession,\" said Alexander Bant, chief of research for CFOs at advisory firm Gartner Inc., adding that companies don't want to have to rehire staff if the economy recovers quickly.</p><p>Recruiters estimate employers on average spend about six to nine months of an employee's salary to find and train a replacement.</p><p>Recent corporate layoffs and hiring freezes have mostly hit thetechnology sector, following a hiring boom. Still, other large non-tech companies including PepsiCo Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Walmart Inc. have announcedjob cuts in recent months.</p><p>Target Corp. last month said it plans to cut at least $2 billion in costs over the next three years without significant layoffs, but it hasn't provided details. Like other retailers, Target is marking down goods to clear excess inventory, which hassqueezed earnings. The retail giant's operating margin declined to 3.9% during the three months ended Oct. 29, from 7.8% a year earlier. Profit fell 52%, to $712 million.</p><p>Target has recently improved efficiency by investing in in-store technology and its supply chain, CFO Michael Fiddelke said on a Nov. 16 earnings call. \"There's a lot of process re-engineering and optimization that we can do that shouldn't have a capital price tag associated with it,\" he said. Target said it expects to provide details about its cost-savings plan early next year.</p><p>The retailer—whose sales jumped earlier in the pandemic—could find savings in its supply chain, fulfillment and merchandising operations, including by automating more tasks in distribution centers, or investing in technology to improve planning and predictability in areas such as apparel, said Corey Tarlowe, an equity analyst at investment firm Jefferies Financial Group Inc.</p><p>Faced with slimmer profit margins, retailers are looking for savings without slashing people and technology, he added, noting that, \"In the face of a recession, that's probably a prudent thing to do.\"</p><p>A key challenge facing CFOs is making sure expenses they cut don't creep back into the business, said David Garfield, global leader of industries at advisory firm AlixPartners LLP. For instance, a company could cut its marketing budget only to spend more on third-party advertising, so savings would be short-lived. \"They have to really understand what is driving the costs in their business, and how to surgically remove them,\" he said.</p><p>Among roughly 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies that reported third-quarter results as of Friday, the average net income margin was about flat from a year earlier at 17%, according to financial data provider S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Many companies over the past year have raised prices to keep up with escalating input costs, in addition totrimming expenses.</p><p>Total selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9% from a year earlier, to $582.8 billion, among S&amp;P 500 companies that reported third quarter-results, according to S&amp;P.</p><p>Choice Hotels International Inc.—which owns hospitality brands including Comfort Inn and Cambria Hotels—is providing franchisees with ideas forcost savings, including offering housekeeping upon request rather than every day, and ensuring staffing levels at breakfast stations are in line with occupancy.</p><p>The initiative, called \"Your Key to Profit,\" also encourages hotel owners to use proprietary software from Choice Hotels that recommends changes to room prices based on local demand, according to Dominic Dragisich, Choice's CFO.</p><p>During the quarter ended Sept. 30, Choice's revenue rose 28% from a year earlier to $414.3 million, while profit fell 12% to $103.1 million due to higher costs.</p><p>Choice hasn't cut corporate jobs in response to the economic outlook, Mr. Dragisich said. \"We think that any recession would likely be a short, shallow recession. We want to make sure that we continue to invest for the long term,\" he said.</p><p>Fast food chain Jack in the Box Inc. is also working to improve the efficiency of its franchisees. That includes installing new kitchen equipment, such as cheese pumps, to speed up production and reduce waste, Chief Executive Darin Harris said on a Nov. 22 earnings call.</p><p>Like its competitors, Jack in the Box is battling higher wages and food prices, and has raised prices over the past year. Still, the company's restaurant-level profit margin during the quarter ended Oct. 2 fell to 16.2% from 20.1% a year earlier.</p><p>While investors are watching how fast Jack in the Box can find savings, store-level layoffs are unlikely, given how the restaurant industry remains understaffed, said Andrew Charles, an equity analyst at Cowen Inc.</p><p>\"Opportunities are derived from efficiencies in process, equipment and technology,\" Mr. Harris said. Jack in the Box declined to comment about job cuts.</p><p>Write to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com</p><p>Cutting Costs, Not Jobs, Is Focus for Many CFOs Facing Slowdown</p>",
