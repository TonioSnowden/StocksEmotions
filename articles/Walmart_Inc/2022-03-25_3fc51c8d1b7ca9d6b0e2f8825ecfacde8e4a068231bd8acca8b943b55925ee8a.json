  "title": "Stopping a Pandemic Deadlier Than Covid; Cardiovascular disease kills more people each year than Covid at its worst. We know how to prevent it. We just need the political will.",
  "text": "<p>First, some basics. In the first two years of the pandemic, Covid killed nearly 900,000 people in the U.S. In those same years, heart attacks and strokes killed more than 1.6 million. Globally, Covid killed more than 10 million people in the first two years of the pandemic; in the same two years, cardiovascular disease killed more than 35 million. The three leading drivers of heart attacks and strokes—accounting for around two-thirds of the global total—are tobacco use, hypertension and air pollution, and all three are preventable.</p><p>During the Covid pandemic, culture wars over masks, vaccines and closures have revolved around forcing people to do something or refrain from doing something. With cardiovascular disease, it simply wouldn't work to try to force people to stop smoking, eat healthy food and wear protective masks all the time. In the U.S., we too often think of health as strictly the result of individual choices and of public health officials as grim taskmasters hectoring everyone to sit up straight, eat their vegetables and do calisthenics.</p><p>But that is not the way public health should work. When public health officials find themselves having to tell people what to do, it usually means that society has failed to make the collective decisions needed to ensure that healthy choices are the default option for most people. Individuals can do a lot to stay healthy, of course, through a range of personal decisions. The larger issue is what we do, as a society, to make it easier for people to make healthy choices.</p><p>Tackling these three killers—tobacco use, hypertension and air pollution—doesn't require making radical changes in society. Americans still very much lived in the same country after we reduced the number of fatal car crashes by outlawing drunken driving, promoted child development by eliminating lead in paint and gasoline, and prevented food poisoning through regulations making food safer. But it does mean regulating companies that sell tobacco and unhealthy foods and cause air pollution so that they are forced to share some of the costs of the enormous harms they cause.</p><p>The first priority is to end the epidemic of tobacco use. Yes, parents can urge their children not to smoke, and individuals can quit—but parents will fail much of the time and smokers who try to quit will fail most of the time. Once people start, especially those who start young, the addictiveness of nicotine in tobacco makes it extraordinarily difficult to stop. Although smoking rates are now at the lowest level ever measured in the U.S., more than 35 million adults still smoke tobacco, each day 1,600 kids try their first cigarette, and tobacco kills nearly 500,000 Americans every year.</p><p>The way to reduce smoking isn't to strengthen individual willpower but to rally our collective will to do something about the problem. Increasing taxes on tobacco can bring in billions of dollars a year in revenue and save millions of lives by using high prices to suppress demand. Rigorous studies have proved that tobacco has a negative price elasticity: For every 10% increase in price, consumption declines by about 4% and by about 8% for children and lower-income groups. About half of that decrease is from people quitting and the other half from people cutting down on the number of cigarettes they smoke.</p><p>Although tobacco taxes have been criticized as regressive because lower-income people smoke more and the majority who don't quit will pay more, Jason Furman, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, demonstratedthat when the financial benefits of better health are included in the calculation, tobacco taxes aren't regressive. Adam Smith said it best in \"The Wealth of Nations\": \"Sugar, rum and tobacco are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation.\"</p><p>I cared for patients who died horrible deaths from emphysema resulting from years of smoking. If, decades earlier, they had magically seen their future, they likely would have quit. That is why hard-hitting antitobacco ads such as the Tips from Former Smokerscampaign—which shows the suffering and disability smoking causes real Americans—help smokers to quit. These ads, which the CDC has funds to air for only a few months a year, prevent an estimated 20,000 premature deaths and save $1.2 billion in smoking-related healthcare costs each year. Dramatically increasing the CDC's antitobacco budget would save even more lives and money.</p><p>A less expensive strategy would be to remove addictive levels of nicotine from cigarettes. De-linking addictiveness, which derives from nicotine, from harm, which derives primarily from tobacco, could end the tobacco epidemic. Congress granted the FDA the authority to do this in 2009, but the FDA hasn't yet done so. One cigarette typically delivers approximately 1 mg of nicotine to the user. Regulations that reduced that amount by at least 90% could make cigarettes no longer addictive and dramatically reduce tobacco use. Doing so, however, would require the courage to stand up to the inevitable legal and political challenges from the tobacco industry.</p><p>Hypertension (more commonly known as high blood pressure) is the only thing that kills more people than tobacco, and like tobacco, it also causes a great deal of disability and lost productivity. We do a terrible job of preventing and treating hypertension, despite clear knowledge of how.</p><p>The most important single step to prevent high blood pressure isn't to shout more loudly at people and tell them what to eat. It is to reduce their sodium consumption—without their even noticing. Nearly all adults consume far more than the recommended upper limit of no more than 5 grams—a teaspoon—of salt a day. Preindustrial societies consumed a small fraction of the sodium that we do currently and didn't have any age-related increase in blood pressure—an increase we've come to view, incorrectly, as an inevitable part of the aging process.</p><p>We don't have to become hunter-gatherers to have healthier sodium intake. Walmart reduced sodium in both national brands and its own brands by 20% over five years; with gradual decreases, consumers don't notice the change. A 30% reduction throughout the U.S. food supply would prevent between 44,000 and 92,000 premature deaths every year and save $10 billion to $24 billion in healthcare costs. The same reduction world-wide would save 1.6 million lives each year.</p><p>It is extraordinarily difficult for individuals in the U.S. to limit their sodium consumption to a healthy level, because we don't really have a choice. The salt we add at the table accounts for less than 10% of the sodium we consume. Foods ranging from breakfast cereal to bread to chicken are bathed in salt. There is no way we will be able to reduce sodium consumption without reducing the sodium levels in packaged and processed foods. (Despite proof that sodium reduction saves lives, a few academic researchers have promoted the erroneous belief that low sodium intake may be harmful. Several studies have reported such a relationship, but these studies have been provento be incorrect.)</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What should the U.S. do to combat rising deaths from heart disease? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The FDA recently published voluntary sodium-reduction guidelines for industry, and these are an important step in the right direction. If followed, they would decrease sodium intake by 12% over the next 2.5 years and even more in the following years. The U.S. and 56 other countries have already taken action to ban artificial trans fat—another significant cause of heart attacks. That initiative will prevent millions of deaths in the decades ahead and shows how effectively regulatory action can improve nutrition.</p><p>Another way to reduce sodium is to promote low-sodium salts, in which about 15-30% of the sodium is replaced with potassium. Most people consume far too little potassium, and increasing consumption further reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A recent study showed that low-sodium salt is safe, acceptable to most people and able to prevent a substantial proportion of cardiovascular deaths.</p><p>Front-of-package warning labels that alert consumers to unhealthy levels of sodium, as pioneered by Chile and now implemented in Israel, Mexico and elsewhere, give consumers the information they need to make healthier food choices. Even more important, they motivate food manufacturers to reduce sodium levels to avoid a symbol emblazoned on the front of their packaging that says their product is unhealthy. Current legal rulings in the U.S. make it unlikely that, without new legislation, front-of-pack warnings would survive well-funded resistance from the food industry.</p><p>Even if we succeed in reducing sodium consumption, more than 35 million Americans will have uncontrolled hypertension, and many of them will suffer from costly and preventable strokes, heart attacks and kidney failure. For the past four years, my organization, Resolve to Save Lives, has worked alongside partners in 41 countries to help scale up effective treatment of hypertension. We learned how it can be done from world-leading health systems such as Kaiser Permanente, which controls hypertension in nearly 90% of its members who have the condition, and countries such as Canada, which has controlled blood pressure in 60-70% of all people with the condition in the country. By comparison, 45% of Americans with hypertension and 15% of people worldwide have it controlled.</p><p>Kaiser Permanente does so well at treating hypertension because its financial incentives support the effort. In most U.S. healthcare systems, when failure to control hypertension leads to a preventable (and expensive) stroke or heart attack, the necessary care—both emergency and ongoing—substantially increases the systems' revenues and profits. Because Kaiser Permanente has integrated its primary and hospital care with its insurance coverage, it saves money by focusing on the effective diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, including comprehensive patient support; the aim is prevention. A similar reward structure in other healthcare systems would greatly improve efforts to control hypertension.</p><p>The third large and preventable driver of the cardiovascular disease pandemic is air pollution. Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (known as PM2.5) is estimated to kill more than six million people a year globally. About half of these deaths are from cardiovascular disease. The U.S. has made substantial progress reducing PM2.5, particularly since the Clean Air Act was amended during the Nixon administration in 1970 to implement emissions controls and vehicle fuel standards, but an estimated 60,000 Americans still die from this pollutant every year.</p><p>To reduce deaths from PM2.5, individual behavior can't make much of a difference. If you live in a polluted place, your choices to reduce your exposure are basically to move or to hold your breath. But as a society, we can improve air quality by increasing the use of clean energy, eliminating the use of solid fuels such as coal and wood for cooking and heating, improving crop- and forest-burning practices, and designing better transportation, buildings and industries. Regulations of vehicles, heating and industry in the U.S. have led to substantial, although far from sufficient, progress in this area, including reducing sulfur dioxide in the air by more than 90% in the past 40 years and PM2.5 by 40% in the past 20 years.</p><p>Urban planning also has a big role to play. Making city streets more walkable and bicycle-friendly can promote commerce as well as health, and better building standards can conserve money and energy while reducing pollution. Improved rail and bus services greatly reduce emissions and pollution while also increasing the efficiency of commutes and employees' access to their jobs.</p><p>Globally, use of wood, dung and charcoal for indoor heating and cooking is a major driver of deforestation, respiratory illness and pollution. As we phase out use of nonrenewable fossil fuels, replacing solid fuel sources with propane as an interim measure, as, for example, India has been doing in recent years, is a win for the environment and for human health.</p><p>Controlling the three main drivers of the cardiovascular disease pandemic in the U.S. could save hundreds of thousands of lives a year; controlling them globally could save millions from cardiovascular disease and millions more from cancer, lung disease and other causes. The effort won't be easy, but the main difficulty isn't medical or scientific—it is political. By structuringenvironments to support health, we can save lives, boost productivity and make our health systems more efficient. Progress will require putting the interests of all of society—including every company that doesn't sell tobacco, salty food or polluting forms of energy—above the interests of these three industries.</p><p>Will the Covid pandemic usher in an era of opposition to all government public-health measures? Perhaps, but it might also lead to a recognition that some public-health actions are essential because, without them, there is no practical way for individuals to control their own health risks. If politicians and other leaders take effective action on tobacco, hypertension and air pollution—and clearly communicate the benefits of doing so—we may come to see that the problem isn't government action but rather inaction in the face of a deadly disease's obvious causes.</p><p>Dr. Frieden is president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
