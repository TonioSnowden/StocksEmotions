  "title": "Asda to take on extra £500m debt after petrol station sale collapses ",
  "text": "<p>Asda is planning to take on half a billion pounds in extra debt and stump up about £250m of its own cash after plans to sell its petrol stations to its owners' other company, EG Group, collapsed. </p> <p>Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the brothers behind EG, and their private equity backers TDR Capital, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c65e8172-94c5-46ce-b895-a327dbd9b119\">agreed to buy Asda last year</a> and had planned to finance the acquisition in part by selling the petrol stations to their own forecourts business for £750m.</p> <p>However, EG Group said on Monday that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f18a086-c73a-4555-bad3-85dcf609c2c7\">forecourts deal had been called off </a>because of “changes to the financial evaluation” of the transaction, leaving the brothers and TDR in need of £750m. </p> <p>That will now come from £500m of debt and £250m from Asda's balance sheet, Asda said in a statement. The Issa brothers and TDR had already loaded Asda with £3.7bn of junk-rated debt.</p> <p>The sale of the petrol stations had been an important part of a complicated series of asset sales and debt deals put together to enable EG Group's owners to complete the £6.8bn acquisition of the UK supermarket, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db8a8d62-f734-43d2-9028-7ae70cf0f833\">using less than £800m of their own money</a>. </p> <p>EG and Asda said on Monday that once the two businesses started sharing commercial information about the petrol stations sale, their teams could not agree on the deal. </p> <p>Asda and EG's teams were allowed to start sharing the information after the Competition and Markets Authority lifted its “hold separate order” in June, they said in a statement. </p> <p>That “resulted in several changes to the financial evaluation of the proposed transaction”, they said. “As a result, EG and Asda have decided they will no longer proceed with the transaction.”&#xa0;</p> <p>While the orders, also known as initial enforcement orders, generally stop parties from sharing commercially sensitive information, they do not prevent them from sharing information for due diligence and integration planning purposes, according to guidance from the CMA. An EG Group spokesman did not immediately comment.</p> <p>EG will now redeem a £675m bond that it issued to finance the proposed deal. The group still intends to pursue other commercial initiatives with Asda, including the rollout of Asda On The Move convenience stores.</p> <p>It said it “continues to anticipate synergies as a result of its growing relationship with Asda”.</p> <p>The sale of the company's distribution assets for well over £1bn, another component of the transaction financing, is not affected by the collapse of the forecourts deal. </p> <p>The Issas and TDR had planned to sell Asda's petrol stations to EG at a valuation of 11 times their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, they said in February. At the time, they expected the deal to close by June. </p> <p>That would have seen EG Group paying a much higher multiple for the petrol stations than the Issas and TDR paid for the whole of Asda, which was about 5.7 times its £1.2bn earnings in the year to December 2019.</p> <p>Asda bonds were slightly lower following the news. “It's a negative for them,” said one fixed-income analyst. “The forecourts are not as profitable as the stores and if they cannot sell them to EG it's unlikely they'll be able to sell them to anyone else.”</p> <p>The news will also be watched by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, the US private equity group that owns EG rival Motor Fuel Group. It is in the process of acquiring Wm Morrison, the UK's fourth largest supermarket chain and another big retailer of petrol and diesel. </p> <p>Petrol stations used to be a big driver of footfall to large supermarket groups, but as fuel retailing has become more competitive the price gap between supermarkets and independent operators has narrowed.</p> <p>There are also longer-term concerns about the ramifications of electric vehicles for fuel stations. Supermarkets are busy installing thousands of electric charging points in their generally underutilised car parks; the time required for a rapid charge is compatible with a full shopping trip.</p> <p>However, fuel retailing is still a useful source of working capital for retailers, who buy large volumes of fuel at advantageous prices and sell it to drivers long before they have paid suppliers for it.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/4bd654ba-bc66-4510-9ff6-1e2603f87880.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Kaye Wiggins, Robert Smith and Jonathan Eley 2021 'Asda to take on extra £500m debt after petrol station sale collapses ' FT.com 18 October.
