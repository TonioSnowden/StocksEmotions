  "text": "<p>   Abbott's tests, meanwhile, were in short supply in stores and online retailers. The Biden administration committed $3 billion to help boost test production and federal officials worked to help more companies secure authorization. The administration struck an agreement with retailers including Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. to sell over-the-counter tests including the BinaxNow at-cost for three months, after criticism that the tests were too expensive. </p><p>   Consumers and public-health experts in the U.S. also started getting more comfortable with at-home diagnostic tests. Before the pandemic, such tests were confined to a small number of diseases and conditions, including HIV and pregnancy. Some medical professionals and health officials had early concerns about the accuracy of the tests or worried that officials would lose track of the number of cases. But by the time the Delta wave was in full swing, many were more willing to deploy and encourage at-home testing. </p><p>   As the Delta wave cooled off in the fall, test makers briefly caught up with demand. Then the Omicron variant arrived and pushed orders higher than ever. </p><p>   Abbott fell behind again. Mr. Ford said he found bare shelves where the BinaxNow was meant to be stocked at his local pharmacy near Chicago over the holidays. Abbott tried to lure workers from other companies including Amazon.com Inc. warehouse workers, paying $25 an hour and offering free meals and twice-weekly Covid-19 testing. </p><p>   It also faced new challenges from market entrants ACON Laboratories Inc. and iHealth Labs Inc., among others. President Biden increased the pressure by pledging to send one billion tests to Americans. </p><p>   \"We're pretty agnostic to the test itself. Whatever gets the job done,\" said Richard Pescatore, a former Delaware health official who is now chief medical officer at Grapefruit Testing LLC, which helps organizations with Covid-19 mitigation. </p><p>   Abbott's share of the U.S. retail seesawed, from 80% in mid-November to 22% by mid-January and then back up to 44% by mid-February, according to Bernstein analysts. In the last three months of 2021, Abbott booked $2.3 billion in global Covid-19 test sales, compared with $511.2 million in Covid-19 sales for competitor Quidel, the companies reported. </p><p>   Quidel's QuickVue at-home test nonetheless made inroads in U.S. retail market share during the holiday surge in demand. \"Despite the ebbs and flows of demand, we continued to aggressively ramp our production capacity,\" said Quidel's chief executive, Douglas Bryant. \"We never wavered, and that proved to be critically important when the Omicron variant hit.\" </p><p>   Now Covid-19 cases are dropping, as is demand for the fast-acting tests. Infectious-disease epidemiologists said that if new variants don't emerge, the spring could bring a respite from the pandemic. Researchers from Arizona State University and other institutions said last week that over-the-counter test capacity will likely shrink from 535 million tests in February to 415 million in April and below 400 million in May. </p><p>   The Biden administration has asked test makers for ideas on managing demand volatility, supply challenges and production impediments. Sustaining the Covid-19 test supply was also part of a new response plan the administration announced March 2. </p><p>   Mr. Ford said a government-industry partnership would help maintain test-making infrastructure in preparation for future Covid-19 flare-ups: \"I think that people realize even with low case numbers, that it's still important to test, it's still important to do surveillance, it's still important to do screenings.\" </p><p>   The company has set what it calls a conservative Covid-19 test-sales forecast of about $2.5 billion for all of 2022 while the CEO keeps a close eye on production at the Gurnee plant, regularly visiting the line in the required hairnet and white lab coat that make him unrecognizable to many of the rank-and-file. He checks the whiteboard listing hourly production for each line: green for above-average output; red for below-average. </p><p>   In an adjoining warehouse, shelves meant to store the boxes aren't full because tests are being shipped out so quickly. Abbott plans to keep operating the facility indefinitely. </p><p></p>",
