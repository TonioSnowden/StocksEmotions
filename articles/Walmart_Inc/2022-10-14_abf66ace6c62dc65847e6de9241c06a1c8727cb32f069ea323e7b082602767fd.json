  "text": "<p>With some creative packing, it is extraordinary what one can jam into a single grocery bag. Two decades ago, America had three major national supermarket chains. Soon that trio could become one.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/402f0f70-c2d7-437b-ade6-3f21727d4dfc\">Kroger</a> announced that it would acquire Albertsons at an aggregate value of $25bn. Albertsons had already consumed Safeway seven years ago. The combined group will have 5,000 stores and more than $200bn in annual revenue.</p> <p>The grocery business has traditionally reported skinny operating margins of 5 per cent at best. The entry of Amazon, Costco and Walmart exacerbated the cut-throat competition. A combination of Kroger, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/fda756b0-b041-4d88-805c-a78b05de46ce\">Albertsons</a> and Safeway may pass regulatory scrutiny because of this encroachment by general retailers and the success of ecommerce. </p> <p>Kroger already has a plan to lighten its load when competition authorities review the deal. It has committed to create a new listed company, holding between 100 and 375 stores, with existing Albertsons shareholders getting shares in this spin-off. Kroger may divest other stores for cash as well. The SpinCo is a tax and time-efficient way to satisfy antitrust regulators keen to reduce any of Kroger's regional market concentration. </p> <p>How well such a diminutive chain is received by the public market remains to be seen. But the mooted valuation ascribed by Albertsons and Kroger — three times ebitda from stores alone — is reasonable. While awaiting the regulatory review, Albertsons shareholders will be paid a fifth of the deal price in a special dividend as compensation.</p> <p>Despite the brutal economics, private equity has minted fortunes in the grocery business. KKR's controversial 1986 buyout of Safeway eventually netted that firm $7bn in deal profits. Albertsons' largest shareholders today are Cerberus and a series of property investors who first invested in the chain in 2005 and will crystallise billions in profits themselves. The shelf life of US grocery deals can be a long one.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Kroger/Albertsons: US grocer bags rival to take on Amazon and Walmart' FT.com 14 October.
