  "title": "Business News: Apollo Weighs Offer for Grocer Morrisons",
  "text": "<p>The announcement came two days after a group of investors led by Fortress agreed to acquire Morrisons for more than $8.7 billion, a bet that the retailer can thrive in a hypercompetitive industry grappling with the shift to online commerce. New York-based Fortress has joined forces with Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and the real-estate arm of Koch Industries, a private conglomerate headed by billionaire Charles Koch.</p><p>The U.K.'s fourth-largest grocery-chain operator had already last month rejected a GBP 5.5 billion takeover proposal, equivalent to $7.6 billion, from Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. The buyout firm has until July 17 to make a formal offer, and has said it was considering one.</p><p>Morrisons shares rose 11% Monday to GBP 2.67, above the level of the Fortress-led bid, which is worth GBP 2.54 a share, including a two-pence special dividend.</p><p>At the height of the pandemic last year, Morrisons and other grocery operators across Europe and the U.S. were pushed to ramp up online delivery services for homebound consumers and keep many of their stores open for those who needed to make in-store visits. But the costs of adding new safety protection measures and additional capacity to meet online sales growth in some cases undercut profits and weighed on the companies' stock prices.</p><p>Based in northern England, Morrisons operates 497 supermarkets along with a network of cafes, gas stations and convenience-store outlets. The retailer also has a wholesale operation that includes supplying groceries to Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Now and other online delivery services.</p><p>The retailer's e-commerce sales tripled in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31. But the costs to meet that demand by adding additional capacity among other Covid-19-related expenses, combined with a drop in fuel sales and the closure of company cafes during lockdown, offset much of that gain.</p><p>Morrisons eked out a year-over-year revenue gain of 0.4% to GBP 17.6 billion while operating profit sunk 51% to GBP 254 million over the same period.</p><p>The retailer's prospects appear to be improving, underscoring the takeover interest in the company. It said its latest quarter ended May 9 showed signs of significantly lower Covid-19-related costs and a rebound in profit from fuel and food-to-go sales.</p><p>Still, the Fortress group's bet on Morrisons is risky. The U.K. is considered one of the world's most competitive grocery-store markets, where Morrisons competes with three bigger operators and two established German discounters, Aldi and Lidl.</p><p>That competition pushed Walmart Inc. in February to sell a majority stake in Asda Group Ltd., Britain's third-largest grocery company, to TDR Capital, a Europe-focused buyout firm, and U.K.-based entrepreneur brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa. The bidders beat out Apollo for that business.</p>",
