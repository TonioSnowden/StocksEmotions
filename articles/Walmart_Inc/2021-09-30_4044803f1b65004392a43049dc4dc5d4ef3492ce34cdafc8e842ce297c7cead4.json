  "title": "Texas Judge Leads Tally of Cases With Financial Conflicts --- Gilstrap didn't recuse in 138 suits involving firms in which he or his wife had an interest",
  "text": "<p>The companies included Microsoft Corp. (53 cases), Walmart Inc. (36 cases), Target Corp. (25 cases) and International Business Machines Corp. (9 cases).</p><p>A 1974 federal law requires judges to disqualify themselves from cases if they, their spouse or minor children hold a financial interest in a plaintiff or defendant, including the interest of a beneficiary in assets held by a trust.</p><p>The Journal investigation, which compared judges' financial-disclosure forms against their court dockets, found that 131 federal judges violated this law from 2010 to 2018, in a total of 685 cases. Judge Gilstrap had several dozen more violations than the runner-up.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, also disclosed one of the largest holdings in a conflicted company. He had a patent-infringement case against a Walt Disney Co. unit while he or his wife reported holding between $100,001 and $250,000 of Disney stock. The plaintiff later withdrew its claim.</p><p>The 64-year-old Judge Gilstrap, one of America's most prominent district judges, said he believed he didn't need to recuse himself from some cases because they required little or no action on his part, and in other cases because the stocks were in a trust created for his wife without her stock-picking input. Legal-ethics experts disagree on both counts.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap declined interview requests. \"I take my obligations related to potential conflicts/recusals seriously,\" he said in one of seven emails to the Journal. \"Throughout my judicial career, I have endeavored to comply with all such obligations, and I will continue to do so.\"</p><p>Federal district judges have considerable discretion on matters of fact finding and other pretrial issues, and this can be especially important in patent litigation, a complex area of law.</p><p>Friends and other lawyers said they couldn't imagine that Judge Gilstrap would ever be swayed by his or his family's investments in making court rulings. \"That man is as pure as the driven snow in terms of his ethics and personal responsibility,\" said Brad Toben, the dean of Baylor University Law School and a longtime friend of the judge.</p><p>An unusually large role in patent litigation has made the Eastern District of Texas a lightning rod for criticism from some academics, corporations and think tanks.</p><p>These critics say its rules encourage patent holders to bring suits there because they are dispatched swiftly, often with quick settlement payouts to the plaintiffs. A 2016 article in the Southern California Law Review described how it said the court engaged in \"forum selling,\" a pejorative twist on \"forum shopping,\" the practice of lawyers seeking out friendly legal venues.</p><p>In one suit, a McKinney, Texas, company called Biscotti Inc. alleged that Microsoft's Xbox One services infringed a patent covering live video-chat capabilities. A jury found in Microsoft's favor in 2017.</p><p>Biscotti sought a new trial, for reasons including an assertion that a video shown to the jury about videoconferencing calls broke evidentiary rules..</p><p>\"The video does not present the sort of prejudice that would justify a new trial,\" Judge Gilstrap said. \"A plethora of other evidence in this record supports the jury's verdict in this regard.\" For most of the nearly five years he oversaw the case, Judge Gilstrap's disclosure forms listed between $15,001 and $50,000 of Microsoft stock.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap took unusually strong action in one 2015 case involving a stock held in his wife's trust.</p><p>A firm called Iris Connex LLC sued Microsoft and 17 other technology companies alleging that their computer and smartphone devices infringed its patent for videoconferencing. In a 2016 ruling, Judge Gilstrap said that \"no reasonable juror could find the accused camera system\" with fixed cameras violated a patent held by the plaintiff that called for a movable camera.</p><p>He granted summary judgment, though the defendants hadn't requested it. He cited precedent that said disposing of the claims at such an early point in the infringement case was highly unusual \"but entirely appropriate at an early stage in a case where . . . the issues are cut and dry.\"</p><p>In a later ruling, Judge Gilstrap also called Iris Connex's lawsuit \"exceptionally bad,\" said the company was a shell meant to insulate the true owner of the patent against sanctions for filing frivolous cases, and ordered him to pay attorneys' fees and expenses to one of the defendants.</p><p>Lawyers for Iris Connex and a spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap said he removes himself from cases involving companies in which he or his wife hold stock -- but not when those stocks are held in a trust created for his wife and her descendants. He said a trustee makes investment decisions for the trust and holds legal title to its assets, and the trust will continue to exist after his wife's death.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap said he checked the trust's characteristics against ethics guidance provided to other federal judges and believes that \"its structure, the limitations it imposes, and the Trustee's discretion place it in a category of trusts which would not require recusal.\"</p><p>Legal experts told the Journal his wife has an interest in the trust's stocks, even if she doesn't hold legal title to them. Federal law defines a \"financial interest\" in a party as either a \"legal or equitable interest,\" such as a beneficiary's interest in a trust.</p><p>\"The judge must recuse if the trust for the spouse has even one share of stock in a party,\" said Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor and author of a judicial ethics casebook, who reviewed the filings for the Journal.</p><p>Investments in his wife's trust should be disclosed if she either is the legal owner of the trust or has an equitable interest, said Ben Johnson, a law professor at Pennsylvania State University, who published research on recusal failures among district judges. \"He would have to recuse.\"</p><p>Judge Gilstrap's financial disclosure forms make no distinction between the trust's assets and stocks the judge and his wife hold in other investment accounts.</p><p>In emailed statements, he declined to provide an accounting of the stocks in the trust but confirmed that Microsoft was among them, reiterating that he believed he had no duty to recuse in cases involving the company.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap initially said he had no duty to recuse himself from cases involving parties in which his family's other investment accounts held stock, because the cases identified by the Journal were handled by a magistrate judge or required only \"ministerial\" actions by Judge Gilstrap.</p><p>After the Journal contacted him, he sought counsel from the U.S. judiciary's ethics committee. A Sept. 2 opinion by the committee, provided to the Journal by Judge Gilstrap, said the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges \"requires recusal when a judge has a financial conflict, regardless of the substance of the judge's actual involvement in the case,\" and \"encompasses a situation where the Clerk's Office assigns you a case, even where you do not act.\"</p><p>Judge Gilstrap said he would follow the panel's guidance. \"In hindsight and considering the attached opinion from the Committee, I now understand that, despite my lack of any involvement or action, such cases result in a need for me to recuse,\" he said.</p><p>He declined to say whether he sought an opinion from the committee on whether he was required to recuse in connection with his wife's trust.</p><p>Court dockets give no indication Judge Gilstrap or the court clerk has notified parties that he had a financial interest while assigned to the cases.</p><p>Fifty-seven judges have told clerks to issue such court notices, in 345 lawsuits, after the Journal identified violations.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap joined the federal bench in 2011, nominated by ex-President Barack Obama and recommended by two Texas GOP senators. He reported that he orhis family owned a total of nearly $1.8 million in shares of more than three dozen companies. In 2018, he reported holding $3.7 million in stocks among total assets of more than $8 million.</p><p>Shares he disclosed owning when nominated included $16,521 of Microsoft, $6,915 of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and $1,756 of Cisco Systems Inc. Within days of his confirmation, his docket filled with over 100 cases, including suits that named Microsoft, JPMorgan and Cisco as parties. By the end of the year, he had over a dozen cases involving firms in which he or his wife had stock, the Journal found.</p><p>A magna cum laude graduate of Baylor with a degree in religion, Mr. Gilstrap went to Baylor Law School. In 1984 he co-founded a firm in Marshall focused on patent law.</p><p>Court rules at the time let plaintiffs file patent suits anywhere the defendant's product was sold. Marshall acquired a reputation for having juries sympathetic to plaintiffs and for being a place where suits could go to trial quickly.</p><p>A series of judges in the Eastern District of Texas adopted local rules that promised a \"rocket docket\" for patent cases. Since 2011, Judge Gilstrap has heardnearly 15% of the over 47,800 patent cases filed in federal courts.</p><p>Assets reported by Judge Gilstrap and his family include companies that are typically defendants in patent suits.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap has retained or enhanced rules that made the court attractive to plaintiffs' lawyers seeking to enforce patents rights, who often seek to settle suits quickly.</p><p>The Eastern District's outsize role in patent litigation has eased since 2017, when the Supreme Court limited plaintiffs to bringing their suits where defendants have an established place of business. The district now is only the third-busiest, of 94 court districts, in patent cases. Judge Gilstrap, though, is still one of the busiest patent judges.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap disqualified himself from a patent case in early 2012 but kept the case when it boomeranged back to him after brief stops in the courtrooms of two other judges.</p><p>In the suit, the plaintiff alleged its patent was infringed by a tool on the websites of McDonald's Corp. and several other companies to help people find stores near them. Judge Gilstrap recused himself without explanation. Asked recently about it, he said, \"This was a long time ago, but I suspect the presence of McDonald's Corp. (which I hold in a personal brokerage account) would have prompted\" him to bow out.</p><p>The judge to whom the case was reassigned retired after about two months. The district court assigned it to another judge, but later took it away from that judge in a rebalancing of caseloads. The case landed in Judge Gilstrap's docket again in January 2013. This time, he didn't recuse himself.</p><p>McDonald's was no longer a defendant, having settled. The plaintiff, however, had filed more suits alleging that various retailers, banks and big-box stores were infringing its patent. Judge Gilstrap consolidated these suits.</p><p>Of the more than two dozen companies that were by then parties, Judge Gilstrap's disclosure forms showed investments in five: Home Depot Inc. and JPMorgan (each $15,001 to $50,000 worth) plus Microsoft, Target and Walmart (each up to $15,000).</p><p>Walmart and the plaintiff, LBS Innovations LLC, entered into an agreement to dismiss the claims against the retailer in September 2013. Judge Gilstrap discarded some of LBS's infringement claims against the remaining companies in a January 2014 ruling. Settlements with Home Depot, JPMorgan, Microsoft and Target quickly followed.</p><p>Judge Gilstrap said the stocks in the five companies were assets of his wife's trust and didn't require his recusal.</p><p>Eric Buether, a lawyer who represented LBS in the case, said, \"My experience is that he's a fastidious judge who holds all parties and lawyers to obey the rules and [I] would not expect this to be anything other than an innocent error if there even were one.\" Mr. Buether has a trial in Judge Gilstrap's court starting next week.</p>",
