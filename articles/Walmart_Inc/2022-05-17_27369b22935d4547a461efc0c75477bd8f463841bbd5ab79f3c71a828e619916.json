The control group, the category that goes directly into GDP accounting, rose 1% in April,\" Roach said.</p><p>However, shares of retailing giant Walmart Inc. WMT fell 7% in premarket trading after it reported fiscal first-quarter profit that missed expectations.

Capacity utilization rose to 79% in April from 78.2% in the prior month. The capacity utilization rate reflects the limits to operating the nation's factories, mines and utilities. Economists had forecast a 78.6% rate.</p><p>Market watchers have been trying to determine whether stocks have fallen enough to warrant a bounce for hard-hit equities, notably in the tech sector.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of China tech names rallied, with Pinduoduo Inc. PDD up more than 10%, Tencent Music Entertainment Group TME up 4.3%, Alibaba Group Holding BABA up over 8% and NetEase Inc. NTES gaining over 3%.</p><p>China's top economic officialgave a public show of support for digital platform companies Tuesday, suggesting Beijing may be ready to let up on a year-long clampdown on technology giants as it battles a slowing economy.</p><p>JPMorgan raised the ratings for the stocks of seven Chinese tech firms on Monday, to overweight from underweight. \"Only in March analysts at the bank had called the sector 'uninvestable,'\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, in a note to clients.</p><p>However, Bank of America's May global fund manager released Tuesday showed the highest cash levels since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S., the biggest short position on tech stocks since August 2006, and the biggest equity underweight since May 2020.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything event at 2 p.m., followed by appearances from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and after the market close, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of Twitter Inc.
