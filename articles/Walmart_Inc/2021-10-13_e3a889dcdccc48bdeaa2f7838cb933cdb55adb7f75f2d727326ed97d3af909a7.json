  "title": "L.A. Port to Operate Around the Clock to Ease Cargo Logjams; One of the nation's busiest ports set to operate 24/7 to ship goods to stores ahead of holiday season",
  "text": "<p>Expanded operations at the Port of Los Angeles, which declined to comment ahead of the announcement, would nearly double the hours that cargo can move, according to the White House. It said the extra shifts have been agreed to by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents dock workers.</p><p>The American supply chain has struggled to adapt to a crush of imports as consumers shifted from services to home goods, including electronics, and as businesses rush to restock pandemic-depleted inventories. Tens of thousands of containers are stuck at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, the West Coast gateways that move more than a quarter of all American imports. Dozens of ships are lined up to dock, with waiting times stretching to three weeks.</p><p>The supply-chain snarl is leading to higher prices and helping drive inflation, which accelerated slightly in September, posing another challenge for President Biden, whose policy agenda is tied up in negotiations in Congress. The administration has been confronted with an array of supply-chain problems, affecting everything from lumber to semiconductors, and it has been seeking ways to partner with private industry to ease the backlog.</p><p>Walmart Inc., FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. are among the companies that have stepped up operations at the ports, according to a senior Biden administration official, with the expectation that other companies will adopt the same cycle. The companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>we want to hear from you</p><p>How are supply chain issues having an impact on your holiday shopping? Tell us in the form below.</p><p>\"By taking these steps, they're saying to the rest of the supply chain, 'You need to move, too, let's step it up,'\" the official said.</p><p>The White House said commitments from six companies would allow 3,500 additional containers a week to move at night through the end of the year.</p><p>Through the first eight months of this year, the neighboring ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handled more than 13.6 million containers, measured in 20-foot equivalent units, a shipping industry trade measure. That included the equivalent of 893,098 loaded inbound containers in August, or more than 200,000 each week, according to figures from the ports.</p><p>To get around the delays, some retailers like Walmart, Home Depot Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. are paying for their own chartered ships as part of wider plans to mitigate the disruptions.</p><p>Mr. Biden is scheduled to meet virtually on Wednesday afternoon with directors of the ports, union officials, chief executives, including those from Target Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co., as well as trucking and rail associations. Mr. Biden is then expected to deliver remarks.</p><p>\"This is a good first step, although it is quite astonishing, and a measure of how severe this is, that it apparently takes the personal involvement of the president of the United States to get this obvious measure implemented,\" said Bjorn Vang Jensen, vice president of global supply chain at Denmark-based marine data company Sea-Intelligence ApS.</p><p>\"It is also encouraging to see that President Biden is meeting with representatives of both importers as well as the trucking and rail communities,\" he added. \"Without the full engagement of all these supply chain constituents, you could keep the port open round the clock for nothing, as containers would just continue to pile up in the yard.\"</p><p>There has been disagreement over 24/7 operations and finger pointing among key players in the supply chain, which includes port workers, truckers, warehouse operators, railways and retailers. On top of all that, there is a shortage of workers.</p><p>When the Port of Long Beach initially launched its expanded hours, it failed to attract more trucks, with operators saying the process was burdensome.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in an interview with CBS Evening News on Tuesday, acknowledged there would be some shortages in the coming months.</p><p>\"But there is an ample supply of goods,\" she said. \"And I think there's no reason for consumers to panic about the absence of goods that they're gonna want to acquire at Christmas.\"</p><p>Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com</p><p>L.A.
