  "text": "<p>\"EPA is taking a major action to help keep global temperature rise in check,\" agency Administrator Michael Regan said.</p><p>The effort has bipartisan support and backing from the industry. The Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group for equipment manufacturers, has said U.S. companies have spent billions of dollars developing alternative chemicals to sell globally, which would get a boost if the U.S. joins international efforts to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs. The group says most of this equipment sold in the U.S. is manufactured in the U.S.</p><p>Chemours Co., the DuPont Co. spinoff, said it has spent $1 billion developing new products for customers anticipating a phaseout of HFCs.</p><p>\"Issues like global warming provide the US an opportunity to lead the world in research and technology,\" Mark Vergnano, the company's president and chief executive said in an email. \"If done right, regulation could help to bring about additional investment.\"</p><p>New EPA estimates in the proposal say it would produce a net gain for the economy of $284 billion from 2022 through 2050. Those gains come from reduced compliance costs for the industry and by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere.</p><p>The rules would cut the equivalent of 4.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from 2022 through 2050, or almost three years of U.S. power-sector emissions at 2019 levels.</p><p>HFCs are synthetic, widely used coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners. They have long accounted for less than 2% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. But they can also linger in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and their heat-trapping capacity can be hundreds or thousands of times that of carbon dioxide.</p><p>Companies with major U.S. operations, including Honeywell International Inc., Chemours and Johnson Controls International PLC, are among the many that have surged into the potential new market. Some retailers like Walmart Inc. have also been supportive of federal regulation, saying it would help them meet pledges to cut emissions by helping clean up their refrigerated sections.</p><p>The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers had previously warned that putting these rules in place too quickly could rapidly raise costs. Consumer prices for appliances might eventually rise only as much as about 2%, as has been the case in previous coolant phaseouts, the industry group Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy has said.</p><p>Nearly all refrigerators sold in the U.S. are likely by year's end to be made without HFCs, said Kevin Messner, the top lobbyist at the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. A phaseout for all home appliances is likely by 2024, he said.</p><p>---</p><p>Austen Hufford contributed to this article.</p>",
