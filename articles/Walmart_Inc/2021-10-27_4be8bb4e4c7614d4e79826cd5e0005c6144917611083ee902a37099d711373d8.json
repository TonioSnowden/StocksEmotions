  "title": "The Property Report:  Retailers Look to Own Warehouses  ----  By Mark Maurer",
  "text": "<p>   Retail giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. think they have found a way to boost their e-commerce operations and save money: Own the warehouses where they stack piles of products. </p><p>   While most retailers still tend to lease the shops where they sell products, more firms are calculating that they will save money in the long run and have more control by owning the warehouse where they store and distribute their goods to online customers. </p><p>   The 25 largest U.S. retailers acquired about 38 million rentable square feet in new industrial space last year, up from 18.8 million square feet the previous year, according to commercial-real-estate data provider CoStar Group Inc. That is the highest total for at least the past 10 years. </p><p>   Amazon is the largest corporate owner of U.S. industrial space, with 78 buildings spanning 83.6 million square feet, according to data and research firm Real Capital Analytics. Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Kroger Co. and Dollar General Corp. have also purchased industrial space over the past year. </p><p>   Some businesses are buying this space in an effort to counter an inventory squeeze caused by supply-chain bottlenecks. Companies want as much inventory in their stores and facilities as they can get, creating a greater need for industrial storage space to support it. </p><p>   \"These properties are essential to getting the goods that you need into the country and flowing through the supply chain to the consumer,\" said Juan Arias, a senior consultant at CoStar. </p><p>   Many retailers also have record levels of cash and are eager to spend it on assets like real estate, similar to the way a number of big tech companies are buying office space. </p><p>   And by acquiring their own fulfillment or distribution centers, retailers are making an investment. Industrial real estate in recent years has become one of the best-performing U.S. property markets, as businesses build out e-commerce operations to meet surging demand from online shoppers. </p><p>   The industrial sector's property values have grown 39% over the past 12 months, compared with 20% growth for that of all commercial property in that period, according to an October report from data-analytics firm Green Street. </p><p>   The 25 largest retailers owned 155.1 million square feet in industrial space at the end of 2020, a more-than-fivefold increase from 10 years earlier, according to CoStar. </p><p>   The retailers still lease about three times the amount of space they own, but that gap is narrowing. </p><p>   Costco owns about 12 million square feet of U.S. industrial space, nearly double that of five years ago, said Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti. In May, Costco paid $345 million to acquire an existing 1.6 million-square-foot facility in Ontario, Calif., a move to expand its West Coast distribution network and better handle Asian imports. </p><p>   The warehouse-club operator historically has owned the majority of its distribution centers because of its strong cash position, Mr. Galanti said. The company last month said its cash and cash equivalents totaled $11.26 billion, up 34.3% from the 2019 period. </p><p>   \"Owning and controlling it yourself, we feel we can provide the best service and the best price to our members,\" Mr. Galanti said. </p><p></p>",
