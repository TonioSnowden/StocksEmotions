  "title": "Biden to Reallocate Unordered Vaccines To States in Need",
  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc. increased this year's sales forecast for its Covid-19 vaccine to about $26 billion, a 73% increase that reflects the shot's growing role in a long-term global vaccination campaign.</p><p>World-wide demand for Covid-19 vaccines will remain in force for at least several years as people seek to maintain protection as the virus circulates, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said Tuesday.</p><p>The new goals are part of the next phase of the Biden administration's vaccination campaign, which will focus on addressing vaccine hesitancy and eliminating barriers that make it difficult for some people to access the shots, such as not knowing where to get the vaccine or difficulty signing up for appointments. The administration is also preparing to distribute shots to adolescents. The shift in policy regarding states' allocations is intended to account for the fact that demand is higher in some states than others.</p><p>Mr. Biden, a Democrat, urged people to get vaccinated, and he said on Tuesday the administration's push was going to be more tailored: \"It's going to get more granular rather than large.\"</p><p>Officials said that Mr. Biden's new goal was informed by infectious disease experts who believe a 70% vaccination rate would lead to a sharp decline in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. A senior administration official said that isn't the same as herd immunity -- the stage when enough people would be protected from the virus that it can no longer spread through the community easily -- which the official described as an elusive number.</p><p>The administration said Mr. Biden was ordering the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help with pop-up vaccination clinics and mobile units, in addition to directing pharmacies in the federal vaccination program to offer walk-in shots. CVS Health Corp. and Walmart Inc. said on Tuesday that they will allow walk-ins at all locations. CVS, along with several other retail pharmacies, had recently begun offering same-day appointments and several chains already allowed walk-ins on a limited basis.</p><p>Officials informed states of the new policy for allocating doses on a call with governors Tuesday morning.</p><p>Many states are seeing vaccine appointments go unclaimed. Arkansas, Mississippi and dozens of counties in Iowa recently cut back on vaccination orders because of drops in demand. Iowa declined 75,280 of 105,300 doses offered to its counties for the week of May 10, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Public Health said.</p><p>Jennifer Fulcher, director of immunization at Mississippi's Department of Health, said the state didn't order its full allotment of first doses for the current week. She said private providers have ordered 1,000 vaccine doses since the state received the last allotment, and none have been ordered for the state health department's drive-through vaccination sites.</p><p>Meanwhile, other states have asked for more doses. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called on the Biden administration last month to send additional doses to the state amid a rise in cases there. At the time, the administration didn't grant the request for additional doses.</p><p>Bobby Leddy, a spokesman for Ms. Whitmer, praised the Biden administration's new vaccine reallocation decision. He said Michigan \"continues to draw down every vaccine that we need to meet the needs of Michiganders, and we are grateful for the Biden administration's actions to increase the availability of vaccines.\"</p><p>The federal government distributes vaccine doses to states based on population on a weekly basis. Previously, doses that went unordered by states were carried over to the state's allocation for the following week. Under the new plan, those doses could be distributed to other states that request additional shots. Unordered doses will be put into a pool that other states can take advantage of, according to administration officials.</p><p>Administration officials said it is up to individual states to decide whether they want to forfeit their doses and offer them up to other states. States' allocations won't be reduced in the future if they don't order all of their allocated doses on any given week.</p><p>The U.S. has administered more than 246.8 million vaccine doses, according to federal data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal. About 79% of doses distributed in the U.S. have been administered. But the pace of the daily vaccine doses administered has been declining since mid-April, according to the CDC.</p><p>---</p><p>Sharon Terlep, Jon Kamp and Melanie Grayce West contributed to this article.</p>",
