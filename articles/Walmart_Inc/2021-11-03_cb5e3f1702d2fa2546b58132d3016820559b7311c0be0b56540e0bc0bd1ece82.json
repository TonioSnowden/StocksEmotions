  "title": "'CoComelon' Owner Nears Sale to Blackstone-Backed Company for More Than $2.75 Billion; Deal would mark second major entertainment acquisition this year for firm led by Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs after Hello Sunshine deal",
  "text": "<p>A deal for Moonbug Entertainment would be the second major deal this year for the Blackstone-backed entertainment venture, which has yet to find a name for itself and is run by former Walt Disney Co. executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs. Earlier this year, the company spent $900 million to acquire Hello Sunshine, the media company founded by Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Moonbug was the subject of takeover interest, citing the company run by Messrs. Mayer and Staggs as a suitor.</p><p>Earlier Wednesday, The Information reported that the Blackstone-backed firm was nearing a deal to buy Moonbug for about $3 billion.</p><p>\"CoComelon\" was one of the breakout hits of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to data firm Parrot Analytics, with parents turning to the show's gentle melodies and computer-generated toddlers to entertain their children during lockdown. The show, which has scored billions of views on YouTube, has given rise to a spinoff series on Netflix Inc. and merchandise in Walmart Inc. stores.</p><p>The race for video-streaming subscribers is driving media companies to sell or merge with bigger players to better compete with the likes of Netflix. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc. said it was purchasing MGM for about $8.45 billion including debt, part of a bid to expand its Amazon's Prime Video service. AT&amp;T Inc.'s WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. earlier this year reached a deal to combine their assets, part of a plan to create a streaming titan that would put Discovery's homespun TV shows under the same corporate umbrella as HBO.</p><p>Moonbug is looking to meet the growing appetite for children's content as the pipeline for popular shows from traditional TV networks runs dry. Demand for children's content grew by nearly 58% since the beginning of 2020, according to Parrot Analytics, far outpacing the increase in overall demand for content.</p><p>London-based Moonbug was co-founded in 2018 by Rene Rechtman and John Robson, former employees of Disney and ViacomCBS Inc.'s Paramount Pictures. Moonbug scouts for popular children's shows and characters on video platforms like YouTube—including the suspender-clad educational narrator \"Blippi\" and early-childhood series \"Little Baby Bum\"—and builds franchises that could include streaming-TV deals, movies and merchandise.</p><p>Mr. Mayer said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in August that he and Mr. Staggs are creating a new entertainment company for Hollywood's streaming era. Some media companies are reluctant to license shows and movies to rivals, Mr. Mayer said, creating an opportunity for a new independent player.</p><p>\"The big guys aren't licensing their content outside of their own closed walled gardens,\" Mr. Mayer said at the time. \"And that's where a scaled, independent entity like ours can really have an advantage in the marketplace.\"</p><p>Media Mergers</p><p>More WSJ coverage on media company deals, selected by the editors.</p><p>* Amazon to Buy MGM, Bagging a Lion to Help Wage Streaming Battle (May 26)</p><p>* Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine to Be Sold to Media Company Backed by Blackstone (Aug. 2)</p><p>* AT&amp;T Agrees to Merge Its WarnerMedia Assets With Discovery (May 17)</p><p>Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com and Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com</p><p>'CoComelon' Owner Nears Sale to Blackstone-Backed Company for More Than $2.75 Billion</p>",
