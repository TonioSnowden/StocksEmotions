  "title": "Kroger to Buy Albertsons in $24.6 Billion Deal That Would Create New Grocery Giant; The combination, which faces likely regulatory scrutiny, would give the grocers greater scale",
  "text": "<p>The deal would also bolster the grocers' market share and technology to compete better with Walmart Inc., the top U.S. grocery seller by sales, and Amazon.com Inc., which has been expanding its food operations.</p><p>\"It allows us to do things we are doing in an accelerated way,\" Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen, who will serve as CEO and chairman of the combined company, said in an interview.</p><p>For Kroger, Mr. McMullen said, Albertsons brings a complementary footprint, with stores in parts of the country where Kroger has none, and that the deal will lead to faster and more profitable growth. Together, the companies said, their stores would supply groceries for an estimated 85 million households.</p><p>The companies said that Kroger will acquire Albertsons for $34.10 a share and that the deal assigns Albertsons roughly $20 billion in equity value. They said the enterprise value of $24.6 billion includes the assumption of about $4.7 billion of Albertsons' net debt. As part of the transaction, Albertsons will pay a special cash dividend of up to $4 billion to its shareholders.</p><p>The deal would create a new power among U.S. supermarket operators, which generate around $812 billion in combined annual revenue, according to an estimate by market research firm IBISWorld. Analysts said it could face a rigorous regulatory review, with federal antitrust enforcers having challenged some mergersunder the Biden administration. Kroger and Albertsons, which both operate stores in places including Southern California, Washington, Texas and Washington, D.C., said they expect to sell overlapping stores as part of the deal to help win regulatory approval.</p><p>Together, Kroger and Albertsons could command about 13% of the food-retail sales in the U.S. following divestitures for regulatory approval, according to J.P. Morgan analystsâ€”smaller than Walmart's 22%.</p><p>The companies expect integrating operations to take about four years, Mr. McMullen said. The combined entity will have a new name, with the companies' current store names staying the same.</p><p>Kroger shares declined 7.3% Friday, as U.S. stocks broadly traded lower. Albertsons shares fell 8.5% Friday, after jumping Thursday when the deal discussions were reported.</p><p>Kroger shares declined nearly 4% in Friday morning trading. Albertsons shares fell 6.5%, after jumping Thursday when the deal discussions were reported.</p><p>Kroger's stock had risen 2% from Dec. 31, 2021 through Wednesday's close, while Albertsons' shares were down about 15% during the same period, compared with a 25% decline in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p><p>Kroger and Albertsons began engaging in serious deal talks about two months ago, Mr. McMullen said. He and Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran have known each other since Mr. Sankaran's previous role at PepsiCo Inc. as head of Frito Lay's North America business. Mr. McMullen also worked with former Albertsons CEO Bob Miller when Mr. Miller led Fred Meyer stores, which Kroger acquired in 1998.</p><p>Both companies have been working with attorneys on potential divestitures that they anticipate will be required to secure regulatory approval, Mr. McMullen said. The companies anticipate that process could take up to two years, he added, with the deal expected to close in early 2024.</p><p>\"We would hope and expect that the [Federal Trade Commission] would understand this supports union jobs,\" Mr. McMullen said. The deal would also allow the companies to invest in keeping prices low, technology and other operations, he said. They have done work on potential buyers they plan to engage with, he said.</p><p>FTC representatives had no immediate comment.</p><p>The companies said Kroger plans to invest in lowering prices for consumers and expects to direct about $500 million in anticipated cost savings toward that goal. About $1.3 billion would be invested into Albertsons stores to improve customers' experience, the companies said. They said Kroger will fund the deal with cash and proceeds from new debt financing.</p><p>As part of the regulatory clearance process, the companies said they plan to establish an Albertsons subsidiary to be spun off to Albertsons shareholders before the merger's closing. The subsidiary would consist of between 100 and 375 stores, which the companies have agreed to identify, they said.</p><p>Combined, the companies said they would have a bigger network of stores, distributors and suppliers, in addition to a national reach and greater manufacturing footprint. Integrating their supply chains would shorten the time it takes products to hit store shelves, executives said on a call with analysts. Pooling customer data would help the companies engage better with shoppers, such as offering personalized promotions, they said.</p><p>The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, one of the biggest labor groups representing grocery employees, said Friday that its officials were discussing the Kroger-Albertsons merger, and that the union will oppose any deals threatening the jobs of workers. Some local UFCW chapters said the deal would hurt workers and customers.</p><p>Together, the companies said they employ more than 710,000 workers and operate about 5,000 stores. They generated more than $200 billion in combined sales in their 2021 fiscal year.</p><p>Kroger, based in Cincinnati, operates more than 2,700 grocery stores, including its namesake locations as well as regional chains like Fred Meyer and Ralph's, and it generated $137.9 billion in sales in its 2021 fiscal year. Albertsons runs nearly 2,300 supermarkets across the U.S., including the Safeway and Vons chains, and reported $71.9 billion in sales for fiscal 2021.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analysts estimated Thursday that the two companies might have to divest themselves of roughly 350 to 450 stores, or 7% to 10% of their footprint, to appeal to regulators. Creating a strong No. 2 behind Walmart could give the combined entity more leverage in negotiations with vendors and help it push back on price increases, they wrote, though they expect regulators to focus more on the enlarged company's regional influence versus its national share.</p><p>For Kroger and Albertsons stores that might need to be sold, there aren't clear buyers, given that many of those stores are unionized, industry analysts said.</p><p>Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, said in February that it was reviewing strategic options, including potential transactions, to boost value for its shareholders and expand its business, less than two years after the company went public. Albertsons has worked to improve its operations and has benefited from increased at-home food consumption during the pandemic, but its shares have largely stayed flat over the past year.</p><p>Grocers generally have performed well in recent years, benefiting as consumers directed more of their food purchasing toward supermarkets during the pandemic. Companies have raised prices over the past year in response to what executives have said are rapidly increasing costs, and consumers are still spending on essentials even as they are pulling back on spending elsewhere. Kroger and Albertsons have said consumers are trading down as prices rise, buying lower-cost store brands or items on sale.</p><p>Kroger to Buy Albertsons in $24.6 Billion Deal That Would Create New Grocery Giant</p>",
