  "text": "<p>Chief Executive Helena Helmersson said sales in its physical stores increased \"substantially\" while online sales did well, too. The company has been working to reduce the need to mark down clothes by speeding up its supply chain and collecting and mining more customer data.</p><p>Overall, sales for the quarter rose 17% to 54.5 billion Swedish kronor, or about $5.35 billion. After tax profit rose to 3.68 billion Swedish kronor from 2.77 billion kronor a year earlier. Gross margin climbed to 54.8% from 53.9%, beating analyst estimates.</p><p>Shares were up 3.6% in afternoon trading in Stockholm. The company also said Wednesday it would buy back three billion Swedish kronor worth of its own shares.</p><p>Many companies are dealing with surging energy, commodities and transport prices, on the one hand, and growing caution on the part of consumers to spend freely on the other. H&amp;M said Wednesday it was trying to offer customers low prices despite high inflation and would also stay focused on its fashion lineup.</p><p>Retailers have offered up a mixed bag of results recently with some American chains like Macy's Inc. and Dollar Tree Inc. reporting strong sales increases as shoppers emerging from the pandemic spent more on clothing for work and special occasions. Shoppers have been turning to discount chains for necessities to offset rising costs for food and fuel. Others like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have reported steep profit declines amid rising supply-chain, wage and inflation-related costs. H&amp;M rival Gap Inc. last month reported a steep sales decline and swung to a net loss, in part blaming macroeconomic conditions.</p><p>Zara-owner Inditex SA earlier this month reported strong quarterly sales, particularly in the U.S., and said about 90% of its stores had reopened. The Spanish retailer recently said its flagship brand Zara would start charging consumers for returns as it works to keep a lid on costs.</p><p>H&amp;M estimates that sales in June will decrease by 6% in local currencies from a year earlier mainly due to its decision to pause sales in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.</p><p>Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com</p><p>H&amp;M Reports Jump in Earnings, as In-Store Sales Rise</p>",
