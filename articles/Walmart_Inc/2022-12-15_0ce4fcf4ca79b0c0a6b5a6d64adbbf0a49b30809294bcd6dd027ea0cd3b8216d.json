  "title": "Retail Sales, Manufacturing Declines Point to Slowing Economy; Shoppers spent less in November on holiday-related items and autos as Fed continued raising rates",
  "text": "<p>The Fed on Wednesday</p><p>raised its benchmark interest rate 0.5 percentage point to a 15-year high and signaled plans to continue lifting rates through the spring. Fed officials have increased rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s to cool the economy and bring down inflation, which is running near a 40-year high.</p><p>\"Most households are acting strategically, planning for a road ahead that may be more difficult to traverse, with higher interest rates, the housing slump, and ongoing inflation—and the very real possibility of a recession,\" said Craig Johnson, president of the retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners.</p><p>U.S. stock losses deepened Thursday as investors digested the Fed's rate plans.</p><p>The economy has shown signs of slowing, and inflation has eased from a summer peak, but the labor market remains tight despite layoffs in sectors such as tech and real estate. Jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell by 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims are up from lows this spring, but remain at levels that suggest many employers are holding tight to workers.</p><p>The drop in November manufacturing output included declines in consumer goods and business equipment products, contributing to a 0.2% drop in overall industrial production, the Fed said. Industrial production also measures utilities and mining output.</p><p>The November decline in retail sales—which includes spending at stores, online and at restaurants—marked an abrupt shift in spending, at least for goods.</p><p>Shoppers spent less in November on holiday categories including electronics, clothing and sporting goods. Spending on autos and furniture also fell sharply, though gasoline sales fell slightly. The pullback occurred online and at department stores in a month that encompasses Thanksgiving, and Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions.</p><p>Consumers, however, spent more on everyday items such as food and healthcare products. They also increased spending on restaurant meals, in a sign that demand for services remains strong despite rising prices.</p><p>Unlike many government reports, retail sales aren't adjusted for inflation and can reflect price differences in addition to purchase totals.</p><p>Retail sales grew 6.5% in November compared with a year earlier, the slowest year-over-year growth since December 2020. It was also less than a 7.1% increase in the consumer-price index for the same period.</p><p>Households also continue to spend more on staples such as food, eroding discretionary holiday spending, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at research firm Forrester. \"Retailers are anticipating a not-great holiday season, they have a ton of inventory and are promoting a lot,\" she said.</p><p>Marcus McNeil, 32 years old, said he is shopping for deals for his 2-year-old's gifts, as inflation eats into his wages.</p><p>\"I'm trying to work longer hours just to be able to give my son a decent Christmas,\" said Mr. McNeil, who works as a customer-service representative for a water-utility company in Homewood, Ill.</p><p>\"It's definitely not like Christmas last year or the year before—you could get a lot of items for your money. Now you have to be more selective,\" Mr. McNeil said. He added that he is trying to save money on grocery and heating bills by packing a sandwich for lunch and \"trying to bundle up and stay warm.\"</p><p>H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB on Thursday said its rate of growth slowed in the fourth quarter. And large retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have noted a shift in consumer spending in recent months. Shoppers have given priority to spending on food and other necessities, more often forgoing spending on toys, furniture and other discretionary spending, said executives at those companies during earnings conference calls.</p><p>Costco Wholesale Corp. last week said sales growth slowed slightly in the most recent quarter compared with recent years as some shoppers bought fewer big-ticket discretionary items.</p><p>The retail-sales report offers a partial picture of consumer demand because it doesn't include spending on services such as travel, housing and utilities. The Commerce Department will release new household spending figures covering goods and services on Dec. 23.</p><p>\"It's a story of slowing momentum,\" said Rhea Thomas, senior economist at Wilmington Trust. She said spending on goods has slowed as consumers shift spending to services, a change from earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>Some consultants and industry groups have predicted slower sales growth for the overall holiday season compared with last year. The National Retail Federation, a trade association, estimates that the holiday shopping season—which encompasses November and December—makes up about a fifth of annual sales for retailers.</p><p>Bank of America last week said spending by consumers using its credit and debit cards decreased in a number of categories in November compared with the prior month, particularly on gasoline, online shopping and home improvement.</p><p>Still, its card data showed consumer spending on leisure services such as air travel outpaced spending on durable goods in recent months, suggesting consumers are giving priority to experiences over physical gifts this holiday season.</p><p>High numbers of tourists visiting Missoula, Mont., this fall helped drive shoppers to Missoula's Imagination Station, according to owner McKenzie Brambo, who said the toy store has been busy.</p><p>Still, she said the business has felt the pinch from inflation and suppliers adding shipping surcharges to invoices, such as \"container charges.\"</p><p>\"There is the concern of the way the market's going, who knows, it makes it hard to project next year and what we're going to buy,\" Ms. Brambo said, adding \"it definitely seems like we're trying to be more cautious moving forward with inventory.\"</p><p>Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com</p>",
