  "text": "<p>The pharmacy practice act in every state actually requires the pharmacist to judge the appropriateness of the medication order and take appropriate action to ensure patient safety, including refusing to dispense the prescription, if necessary. Requiring the clinical indication or diagnosis be placed on every prescription order would dramatically improve pharmacists' ability to fulfill this essential legal and professional responsibility.</p><p>Prof. Michael T. Rupp</p><p>Midwestern University College of Pharmacy, Glendale</p><p>Glendale, Ariz.</p><p>---</p><p>Every time I write a prescription for a Drug Enforcement Administration controlled substance, I write my unique DEA registration number on that prescription. The federal government thus knows what physician writes the prescriptions for all controlled substances. The opioid epidemic described by J. D. Vance in \"Hillbilly Elegy\" was the responsibility of a relatively few physicians writing the prescriptions that have fueled this deadly epidemic. Some are physicians acting in good faith who overprescribe without appropriate concern for the addictive potential of these substances. After all, the New England Journal of Medicine in 1980 published a physician's letter stating these medications are safe in patients \"with no history of addiction.\"</p><p>Most are written, however, by physicians who at best are absolutely irresponsible, or at worst essentially drug dealers with a license to deal. The Justice Department knows who these physicians are because they have the records already. Literally, the DOJ has their (DEA) number. It doesn't need to go after Walmart when it knows who is responsible -- the physicians.</p><p>Em. Prof. Douglas A. Kramer, M.D.</p><p>University of Wisconsin School of Medicine</p><p>Middleton, Wis.</p><p>---</p><p>The civil suit against Walmart filed by the Justice Department is appropriate and long overdue in challenging the actions of Walmart management that usurp the decisions that should be made by its pharmacists. Considering the consequences of their actions, there should be criminal charges against Walmart and its management rather than a civil suit.</p><p>The pharmacist's paramount responsibility is to patients. Their licensure by states provides the authority and responsibility to independently exercise their professional judgment on behalf of their patients. The assertion that \"[s]tate laws require pharmacists to fill prescriptions that have been validly written by qualified medical practitioners\" is not correct. The pharmacist is the last defense in protecting patients against prescribing errors and other drug-related problems. Pharmacists are in the best position to identify situations in which opioids or other medications are prescribed in a manner that results in abuse, diversion and deadly consequences. Walmart pharmacists wanted to refuse to dispense these prescriptions, but their management rejected their efforts to do so and created a situation in which the continued employment of the pharmacists would be at risk if they exercised their best professional judgment instead of complying with the profit-motivated management decisions.</p><p>The deadly actions of Walmart and its management have now been exposed, and there must be consequences.</p><p>Daniel A. Hussar, Dean emeritus</p><p>Philadelphia College of Pharmacy</p><p>Newtown Square, Pa.</p>",
