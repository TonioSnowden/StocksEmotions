  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Instagram Parenting Guru Tackled  Toddler Tantrums, and Now Potty  ----  By Ellen Gamerman",
  "text": "<p>   Becky Kennedy is promoting her parenting brand in places that are conventional -- like the \"Today\" show and NPR -- and places that are not, like the bottom of a children's potty. </p><p>   The clinical psychologist, \"Dr. Becky\" to the desperate parents who found her child-rearing advice during their late-night Instagram scrolls at the height of the pandemic, has just released her first book, \"Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be.\" It is a road map for parents that gives priority to connection with children over punishment and rewards. </p><p>   In the next couple of weeks, Dr. Kennedy will unveil her first product partnership, an \"all-in-one potty kit\" from Miami company Frida. A caricature of her face in gentle pastels appears with tips on a printed guide tucked inside the toilet that parents remove from the bowl to read. The product, which incorporates Dr. Kennedy's preferred term \"potty learning\" instead of \"potty training,\" will be sold at retailers including Walmart, Target and Amazon. </p><p>   Dr. Kennedy sells $54 workshops and $23-a-month subscriptions on her website, or \"community,\" as she calls it. The platform, slickly designed by a former product manager from fashion site Rent the Runway, features video tutorials and suggested scripts for tough conversations with children. It launched five months ago and has nearly 15,000 members. </p><p>   Dr. Kennedy, 39, who lives with her husband and three children, ages 10, 7 and 5, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, sees an untapped market. If people are willing to hire personal trainers, she argues, they should feel OK about paying for a parent coach, too. </p><p>   The 1.4 million followers on Dr. Kennedy's \"Good Inside\" Instagram account include celebrity moms such as Gigi Hadid, Jennifer Garner and Eva Mendes. Dr. Kennedy is planning Instagram Live spots with author Katherine Schwarzenegger, who is married to actor Chris Pratt, and Meena Harris, niece of Vice President Kamala Harris. </p><p>   Every decade, an Alpha parent seems to emerge. The 1980s introduced Heidi Murkoff's \"What To Expect\" empire of mom-to-mom advice. (Sing to your baby in the womb!) In the 1990s, it was Dr. William Sears and \"Attachment Parenting.\" (Let babies sleep in their parents' beds!)In 2001, the baby whispering method was the gospel. (Find your baby's personality type!)In 2011, it was Amy Chua, author of the bestselling \"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,\" which had Americans trying to raise children with the discipline and high expectations of Chinese parents. </p><p>   Dr. Kennedy's style focuses largely on empathy, curiosity and play. (Pretend you're having a meltdown and regulate it! Act out solutions with stuffed animals when your child is rude!) </p><p>   Her Instagram account took off when working adults were trapped at home with their children during Covid. Moms and dads felt an urgent need for help and had the time to attempt her self-aware scripts, which hold that their kids are good people having a hard time. \"Remember, our kids are always absorbing the versions of themselves we reflect back,\" she cautions in the book. </p><p>   Many adults raise their children as their own parents did, Dr. Kennedy writes, which is to say, they treat the job like animal training. The result, she argues, is parenting that fails to teach life lessons and raises future adults more likely to struggle with shame, lack of self-confidence and an inability to trust their own instincts. </p><p>   Now parents are back in the office, kids are in school, and more third-party disciplinarians are delivering timeouts and demands for apologies, the exact opposite of Dr. Kennedy's method. </p><p>   \"People do often say that this parenting style takes time, but I think really it's just a matter of how we spend our time,\" Dr. Kennedy says. \"Either we spend our time connecting to our child, or we spend our time managing resistance, power struggles and our own parent-guilt spirals.\" </p><p></p>",
