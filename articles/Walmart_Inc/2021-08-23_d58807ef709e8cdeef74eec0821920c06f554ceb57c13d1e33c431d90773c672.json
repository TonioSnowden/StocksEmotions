  "text": "<p>Former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester is to become the chair of easyJet.</p> <p>Hester will join easyJet's board as a non-executive director from the start of September and will succeed John Barton as chair three months later, the airline said. He signed up for an annual pay package of £314,568.</p> <p>Hester said he was “a longstanding admirer of easyJet, and from my own experience as a customer, I am very excited to be joining the airline and look forward to playing my part in driving its continued success.</p> <p>“I see so many opportunities for this iconic brand in the coming years, all underpinned by its proven business model, unrivalled network and loyal customer base. I am convinced we can be winners in the European airline industry of the future, serving customers well and driving attractive shareholder value. I can't wait to join the easyJet team. ”</p> <p>Hester was chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008 until 2013, having succeeded Fred Goodwin. He then became chief executive of RSA Insurance from 2014 to May 2021 when it was bought by Tryg and Intact Financial Corporation.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Shaftesbury</strong>, the central London landlord, said in a trading update that West End footfall has to date recovered to between 50 and 60 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. The company reported a “significant” reduction in vacancies, a trend it expected to continue to improve. For the six months to March 2021 it had collected 45 per cent of its rent roll, up from 43 per cent at interim results in May. </p> <p><strong>WPP</strong> said it had agreed to buy Satalia, a UK based technology company developing artificial intelligence and machine learning whose clients include BT, Tesco and Unilever. The advertising group did not reveal terms of the deal.</p> <p>Outsourcer <strong>Mitie</strong> agreed to sell its document management business to Zurich-based Swiss Post Solutions for £40m on a debt-free cash-free basis. The company said it would continue offering document management to its customers via its preferred supplier partnership with SPS. The division delivered revenue of £48m and an ebitda of £4.2m for the twelve months to March, Mitie said.</p> <p><strong>Burford Capital</strong>, the&#xa0;litigation financing group, said new business hit record levels in the first half with direct commitments exceeding $500m. A low level of case activity as a result of Covid meant only one significant win in the period. Burford&#xa0;expects to report a loss of around $70m for the first half given one-time non-cash accruals, or a $20m profit on an underlying basis.</p> <p>Chain maker <strong>Renold </strong>said in a trading update that strong momentum has been maintained in the new financial year, resulting in the continued recovery of both revenues and order intake. Revenue for the four months ended July was up 13.6 per cent year on year to $62.5m, the company said. As a result, Renold now expects adjusted operating profit for both the first half and full year to be higher than both market expectations and the equivalent prior year period.</p> <p>Apollo is said to be running the rule over <strong>J Sainsbury</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bidders-train-guns-on-sainsburys-sh8228nst\">Sunday Times reported</a>. The US private equity group has been scouring the industry for targets after being outbid for Asda last year, and remains in talks to join the Fortress-led consortium bidding for Morrisons. Any involvement in that deal may preclude a move for Sainsbury's, the paper said.</p> <p><strong>Female board members</strong> at the UK's largest companies are paid about&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-96b90579-b7cd-44a8-ba7e-cad6be5c6faa/xpaXcdGiB0FAJW4n0BJKzA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjBbNXP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvOTZiOTA1NzktYjdjZC00NGE4LWJhN2UtY2FkNmJlNWM2ZmFhP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjEyMzJhZGY4MTExMjcwMDA0ZDkxZmRhJnNlZ21lbnRJZD0yMjAxMWVlNy04OTZhLThjNGMtMjJhMC03NjAzMzQ4YjdmMjJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphH4UuI2HUgSkqUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">40 per cent</a>&#xa0;less than their male counterparts, according to new data that reveal the gender pay gap is widest in the upper ranks of corporate Britain.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Sanjeev Gupta's metals conglomerate <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> is in talks with White Oak Global Advisors about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c704054-dfca-428b-b941-f5e54edd2266\">refinancing his European operations</a>, in a deal that could end months of uncertainty for thousands of steelworkers. The San Francisco-based private finance group has already stepped in to provide new funding for GFG's Australian steel plant and associated mines but talks between the two have recently broadened out to include other parts of Gupta's empire, several people familiar with the situation have confirmed.</p> <p><strong>PayPal</strong> said it will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The rollout marks the first expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-launches-crypto-buying-selling-uk-2021-08-22/\">Reuters reported</a>. Bitcoin briefly rose above $50,000 on Sunday to reach a more than 3-month high.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson <br></strong>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e77a83b-bf88-4efb-8294-31db74db03c5\">backlash has begun</a> against environmental, social and governance-themed investing. A mood of growing self-congratulation in boardrooms has been mirrored by growing public dissatisfaction. More transparency, better data and greater accountability are badly overdue.</p> <p><strong>Mohamed El-Erian</strong> <br>It would not be a surprise if Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, in a keynote speech this week at the annual confab of central bankers at Jackson Hole, opts to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a71ae5c8-5ea4-4097-9119-6af8da91c2dd\">fly under the radar screens of markets</a>. But the longer Powell waits to detail his own thinking, the greater the challenges to maintaining Fed unity, and the bigger the risk that the central bank will be forced into a more disorderly slamming of the policy brakes down the road.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Hester appointed chair of easyJet' FT.com 23 August.
