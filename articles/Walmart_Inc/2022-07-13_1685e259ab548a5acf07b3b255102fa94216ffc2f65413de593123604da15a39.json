  "text": "<p>   Walmart Inc. has agreed to buy 4,500 of Canoo Inc.'s forthcoming electric delivery vehicles, as the retail giant looks to bolster its e-commerce delivery service with a fleet powered by electricity. </p><p>   Under the purchase agreement, Walmart has an option to purchase up to 10,000 of Canoo's all-electric delivery vehicles, called the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle. </p><p>   The delivery vans, which Canoo says is optimized for last-mile delivery, is expected to begin hitting the road next year. The companies plan to kick off advanced deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in the coming weeks to refine vehicle configuration, they said Tuesday. </p><p>   The companies didn't place a dollar figure on the deal or say when Canoo, which has previously aired concerns that it may not have enough cash on hand to continue operating for long, would receive payment. </p><p>   The deal sent shares of Canoo, which last year put its headquarters in Walmart's hometown of Bentonville, Ark., soaring nearly 80% to $4.25 a share. At one point on Tuesday, the stock had more than doubled to $5 a share. The stock is still down some 45% so far this year. </p><p>   Walmart said it would use the vehicles to fulfill online orders, including groceries and general merchandise, while helping push the company to reach its goal of achieving zero-emissions by 2040. </p><p>   Walmart is locked in a battle with Amazon.com Inc. and other rivals in the U.S. e-commerce space, with a particular focus on last-mile delivery. </p><p></p>",
