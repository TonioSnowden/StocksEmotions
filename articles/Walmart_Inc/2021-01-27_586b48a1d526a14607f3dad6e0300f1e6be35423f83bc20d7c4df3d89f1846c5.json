Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed0059c9-1ea5-4ba9-a1ff-88004b59e71d\">urged Brussels</a> to force companies to obtain permission before shipping jabs from the bloc.</p> <p>Pascal Soriot, chief executive of Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, described the company's delivery schedule as a “best effort” rather than a “commitment”, further enraging Brussels officials already angry at what it sees as the unfair priority given by the company to its UK orders.</p> <p>EU tensions were heightened today when the regional governments of Madrid and Catalonia complained of supply shortages. Madrid said it was halting its vaccination programme for at least 10 days because of a lack of supplies and Catalonia warned it could run out of the vaccine by Thursday.</p> <p>French pharmaceuticals group Sanofi said today it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a831fcdd-5793-3374-b281-80c4afe06640#post-59972\">accelerate production</a> of the BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and add millions to the EU supply.</p> <p>The EU has faced frequent criticism over its failure to get the vaccine into the arms of its citizens quicker. The UK, by contrast, has now vaccinated (with the first of two shots) more than a tenth of its population and the US has also made a strong start.</p> <p>The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has yet to be formally approved by the European Medicines Agency, the bloc's regulator, and Brussels has been less supportive of financial research support for pharma groups, the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e92cf4f6-2fa2-42e7-beb8-2c0b04af864c\">Lex column</a> points out. </p> <p>But the frustration with government vaccination programmes is not confined to the EU. In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb1b273d-1df2-4ec9-8aad-f4b79de5ee19\">Brazil</a>, a group of companies dismayed at the slow rollout of vaccines has looked at buying doses directly from manufacturers. In the US, private sector companies including Amazon, Walmart and Starbucks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/295384a2-6ab1-479a-b760-ddf28bb25cc0\">have offered to help</a> the new Biden administration accelerate distribution.</p> <p>One exception is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3aae4345-46cc-4636-a3f9-a93a6762f87f\">Israel</a>, which has managed to secure more vaccine than it needs after agreeing to share the country's epidemiological data with manufacturer Pfizer.&#xa0;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/044ef5c8-d07e-47df-9264-769457130991\">FT</a>, however, cautions against “vaccine nationalism”. Export bans “risk retaliation from other trading partners, disrupt supply chains and do little to expand overall vaccine production, which must be the common goal”, the Editorial Board said (you can read more on the proposals in our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/875f6a1f-e740-4a4d-b203-24e43c09b654\">explainer</a>).</p> <p><strong>Bookmark this</strong>: <em>More than 71m coronavirus jabs have now been administered in 65 countries.

But he disagrees with the notion that “this crazy bubble will burst soon”. “We've stopped dancing, we are standing closer to the door, but we haven't left the party yet,” he writes. </p> <p>Read more in our ongoing <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/runawaymarkets\">Runaway Markets </a>series.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Jumps in sales of PCs, video-gaming demand and increased use of <strong>Microsoft's</strong> cloud services helped the company's revenues surge 17 per cent to $43.1bn in the fourth quarter and its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/720ba9e9-8cea-4583-b26e-d98a74c4db21\">shares</a> to hit an all-time high. Chief executive Satya Nadella said the pandemic had led to “the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry”.</p> <p>Reduced demand for air travel was part of the reason airline manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e6b8a47-199e-4b24-951f-d009a0185223\">Boeing</a> reported a record annual loss of almost $12bn and postponed the introduction of its new 777X jet until late 2023. Cash outflows at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eeacfa60-a6a9-4007-a094-99bba5a5a834\">Rolls-Royce</a>, which makes aeroplane engines, will hit $2bn this year. Total flying hours for its engines this year are expected to be just above half pre-pandemic levels. </p> <p>Fears over <strong>new variants</strong> of coronavirus have thrown the spotlight on to how quickly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bfe4375-ef37-4168-9a86-1c48be6cd5b1\">drugmakers</a> can adapt their vaccines. Pharma correspondent Hannah Kuchler and science reporter Anna Gross explain how development times are shrinking. </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Updated global forecasts from the <strong>IMF</strong> show the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/341577c5-92f2-4bd3-a235-331d0db5dbbd\">US and China</a> leading the race for economic recovery, leaving Europe and EMs in their wake. “Faster progress on ending the health crisis will raise global income cumulatively by $9tn over 2020 to 2025, with benefits for all countries, including around $4tn for advanced economies,” the fund said in its latest global economy forecasts. The <strong>UK</strong> — which yesterday passed the milestone of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/675d737e-88a5-4d84-9222-013eb5fdf6e3\">100,000 deaths from the disease</a> — will fare particularly badly, the IMF said, and would not recover lost output until 2023. </p> <p>French finance minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07ee0a9e-4db2-4ca0-8b05-521ab2e11898\">Bruno Le Maire</a> told the FT that the<strong> EU's €750bn</strong> <strong>recovery fund </strong>was “too slow and complicated”. Member states need to explain how they will use the grants and loans by the end of April and once approved by the European Commission they can be disbursed in the second half of the year. Germany's former finance minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba177185-90c6-41cc-8989-5efe77689392\">Wolfgang Schäuble</a> said the EU had spent too much time arguing about the size of the fund and how it should be distributed, and not enough “thinking about what to spend it on”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a831fcdd-5793-3374-b281-80c4afe06640#post-59981\">Germany</a> today cut its forecasts for growth while separate data showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a831fcdd-5793-3374-b281-80c4afe06640#post-59971\">consumer confidence</a> in Germany and France had plunged. </p> <p><strong>US President Joe Biden</strong> said for the first time he was ready for compromise on his $1.9tn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e4b2cb7-b3bb-4c79-a9af-83b9085ea7af\">coronavirus recovery plan</a>, possibly lowering the income threshold for people to receive another round of stimulus cheques. The <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong> is meeting for the first time this year to decide interest rates — the first under the new president — as it reviews economic progress. It will issue a statement today at 2pm ET: here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f60fecc-d3a7-49f6-85bd-d9d5ac0de4ea\">five things to watch</a>. </p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Reader NotBillGates comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8edfb238-48b6-43a3-ab8b-1a0d951f811c?commentID=cb47fd55-6ec1-45a9-9830-e83be1d25b0f\">Retail has a place on the UK high street of the future</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Business rates are not fit for purpose in a post-digital economy. However, there would appear to be a couple of easy fixes: <br>1. Conduct the overdue rating revaluation now to recognise the shift in value that has occurred from retail to industrial and logistics property which would significantly redress the outdated burden placed on retail property.<br>2. Introduce a congestion charge for delivery vehicles that enter urban areas to reflect the changing nature of commerce. It's fair, easy to enforce and in line with local authorities' stated objective of reducing carbon emissions in urban areas. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Itching for some adventure after months of lockdown?
