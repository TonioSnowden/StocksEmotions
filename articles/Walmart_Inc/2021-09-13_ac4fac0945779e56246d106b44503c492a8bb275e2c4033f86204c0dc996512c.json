  "text": "<p>Shares of Walmart were little changed on the day and has gained 1.2% in the year to date, trailing gains of over 14% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and 19% for the S&amp;P 500 index SPX.</p><p>Litecoin is a virtual coin that has largely been overshadowed by the likes of bitcoin BTCUSD and Ether ETHUSD on the Ethereum blockchain. Some describe as crypto silver compared against bitcoin, which is seen as digital gold.</p><p>A message on a verified Twitter account associated with litecoin, which touted the fake partnership with Walmart, was deleted and a number of media venues retracted headlines and stories that had published the falsified report.</p><p>A request for comment from Walmart via email wasn't immediately returned.</p><p>https://twitter.com/MorningBrew/status/1437419704184885249?s=20At last check, litecoin LTCUSD was changing hands at $181.26, or down about 1.5% on CoinDesk, but was still boasting a year-to-date return of about 50%.
