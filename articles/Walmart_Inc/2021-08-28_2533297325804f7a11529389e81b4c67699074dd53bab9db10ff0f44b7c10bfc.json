  "text": "<p>Pfizer and BioNTech SE took their shot and won. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people 16 and older, the agency's first full approval. Regulators green-lit the shot last year on an emergency-use basis, just as they did for Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccines. Public-health officials see the FDA's approval as a key step to convince hesitant individuals to get the shot and to encourage employers to mandate it, especially as cases tied to the contagious Delta variant surge. Pfizer shares added 2.5% Monday.</p><p>WALMART INC.</p><p>WMT -1%</p><p>Walmart delivery drivers will soon be dispatched to other businesses. The big-box retailer is opening up its in-house delivery platform, Spark Driver, so that the gig workers delivering Walmart orders can make additional drop-offs along the way. The delivery person wouldn't arrive in a Walmart vehicle or Walmart attire, making it an option for other big chains as well as smaller businesses. The Walmart offering joins a crowded field of players looking to handle last-mile deliveries, including a similar service called Shipt, which is owned by rival Target Corp. Walmart shares lost 1% Tuesday.</p><p>DELTA AIR LINES INC.</p><p>DAL +1.9%</p><p>Delta won't let unvaxxed workers fly under the radar. The airline on Wednesday said it would impose monthly $200 health-insurance surcharges for employees who don't have their Covid-19 shots, starting in November. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will require employees and visitors to be fully vaccinated starting Sept. 7, while Walt Disney Co.'s Florida theme-park workers must get shots by Oct. 22. Delta shares rose 1.9% Wednesday.</p><p>AIRBNB INC.</p><p>ABNB +10%</p><p>Airbnb has the welcome mat out for Afghan refugees. The home-sharing company said Tuesday it will offer free, temporary housing around the world for 20,000 people fleeing Afghanistan during the Taliban takeover. Airbnb and its nonprofit, Airbnb.org, will work with resettlement agencies and nongovernment organizations. As of Tuesday, 165 Afghan refugees had been housed. The rapid return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan created a desperate rush among residents to leave the country, as Afghans flooded the Kabul airport. Airbnb shares gained 10% Tuesday.</p><p>SALESFORCE.COM INC.</p><p>CRM +2.7%</p><p>Salesforce isn't slacking off as the Delta variant spreads. The new owner of workplace messaging platform Slack Technologies Inc. on Wednesday reported a jump in sales for most recent quarter, thanks to continued demand for cloud services from the pandemic's remote-work boom. Salesforce projects record sales for the current quarter, its first with Slack fully on board after completing its acquisition last month. Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor said the Delta variant has reinforced the adoption of digital tools after upending return-to-work plans. Salesforce shares rose 2.7% Thursday.</p><p>HP INC.</p><p>HPQ -0.6%</p><p>The pandemic supercharged computer demand, but HP can't keep up. The company is struggling to meet customer appetite for laptops and PCs as shortages and supply-chain issues hold back sales. \"We are selling everything that we build,\" CEO Enrique Lores said Thursday. HP isn't alone. Dell Technologies Inc. on Thursday also reported a swelling backlog. A semiconductor shortage drove up prices and hamstrung production in many industries, and some say the end isn't in sight yet. Intel Corp. CEO Pat Gelsinger expects the shortfall to last into 2023. HP shares lost 0.6% Friday.</p><p>PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC.</p><p>PTON -8.5%</p><p>Peloton is facing an uphill ride as its pandemic boom ends. The exercise equipment maker enjoyed a surge in demand after the onset of the pandemic, but on Thursday the company slashed the price of its original stationary bike by 20% and predicted more muted growth in the coming year. Executives told investors they were trying to add as many customers to Peloton's subscription workout classes as possible, even though the price cut and higher shipping costs would lower near-term profits. Peloton shares fell 8.5% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
