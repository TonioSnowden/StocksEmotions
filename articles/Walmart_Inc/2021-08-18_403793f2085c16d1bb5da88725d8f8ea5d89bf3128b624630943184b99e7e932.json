This suggests workers are in their strongest bargaining position for several decades.</p> <p>According to FT commentator Martin Sandbu, we could be experiencing a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a91aa7dc-ac9f-4811-82e7-ce96bd2af99d\"> profound shift in the relationship</a> between employer and employee, a dynamic on show in the highly charged debate about returning to the office, and in some cases, whether those who continue to work from home should earn less.</p> <p>Pay cuts for remote workers were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c52a7a2-aa65-11ea-abfc-5d8dc4dd86f9\">floated in the US by Facebook</a> last year and are said to be under consideration at several of its tech rivals. The idea has now reached the UK government, where an unnamed minister has suggested that people who have been working from home have had a de facto pay rise because they are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eceaa014-cbd9-4b2a-82ab-69a4fca07ff3\">no longer paying commuting costs</a>.</p> <p>As our Lex column points out, some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7f57278-dd6b-43f5-a95f-abc7afc436ff\">double standards</a> are at work here. Employers that argue that staff who work remotely should earn less because their costs are reduced rarely increase pay when workers' costs go up — for example, when they have more children. Companies also benefit from reductions in office rental and utility bills which are outsourced to workers.</p> <p>Columnist Sarah O' Connor argues that cutting pay for remote workers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a37150e3-7480-4181-90e4-1ce9dc5d1d39\">is a risky move</a>, highlighting that some are paid differently for the same work. New systems would also have to be set up to constantly adjust wages to market conditions and employee moves.</p> <p>Moreover, the FT argues, the switch to more flexible arrangements during the pandemic has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cbf34b2-3c12-4e12-bb7f-bcd903d89c9f\">benefited employees and employers alike</a> — making it easier for workers to balance a range of commitments as well as reducing company costs. Employers should focus on persuasion rather than coercion to entice workers back, it argues. And ministers should steer clear of suggestions that home workers are skiving — something not backed up by evidence.</p> <p>Cack-handed efforts to coerce and cajole staff back to the office say less about workers and much<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce5ee7f-e94a-4cf0-b9a3-83a35e1530a8\"> more about their bosses</a>, writes management editor Andrew Hill. “If after 15 months, you have only a ‘suspicion' about what your people are up to, and find it ‘hard to know' who are your top performers, you are guilty of neglect at best, mismanagement at worst,” he says, concluding: “They should think twice before blaming their team's location for failings whose cause can often be found much closer to home.”</p> <p><em>What has your employer done to persuade you to return to the office?

The pick up in the housing market was reflected in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/010a9adc-7310-4329-9615-1d8363346dba\">strong trading results</a> from <strong>Persimmon</strong>, one of the country's largest housebuilders.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong> was rocked by an outbreak of coronavirus, resulting in a new government lockdown, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87006c97-a4e7-4989-9e9a-f3785ec8023b\">tumble in the country's currency</a> and a planned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/251c5d86-34cf-4a2c-a74c-327a7890bacd\">interest rate rise</a> being delayed. The Reserve Bank of&#xa0;New Zealand&#xa0;had been&#xa0;expected to become the first central bank in the developed world to raise rates during the pandemic.</p> <p>Tourism across Europe has been badly affected by the pandemic but <strong>Switzerland</strong>, which has promoted itself heavily as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f22f9002-69a2-4582-8f33-f2121f24426d\">destination for Asian travellers</a>, has suffered particularly badly. The industry accounts for about 3 per cent of Swiss gross domestic product and 4.4 per cent of jobs, making it one of the country's most important economic sectors (and roughly twice the size of watchmaking).</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Norway's $1.4tn oil fund</strong>, the world's second largest sovereign wealth fund, reported a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c9f7dec-7a28-4d67-bc4b-60717ebc9f26\">return of 9.4 per cent</a> in the three months to the end of June, boosted by rising oil prices and strong performances from banks. The fund acts as a giant index fund, owning 1.4 per cent of every listed company in the world as well as a mix of bonds, property and energy assets.</p> <p><strong>Carlsberg</strong> increased its full-year profits guidance as it reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d7253d4-875c-473c-9b9a-2b02152445a0\">better than expected second quarter sales</a> of DKr18.7bn ($2.9bn). The world's third-largest brewer said markets were returning to a “more normal” environment in Europe but were still constricted by new waves of coronavirus infection in most Asian countries apart from China. </p> <p><strong>Walmart</strong>, the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6d84d75-b9c6-416e-9bcb-418c445fe0fa\">raised its full-year targets</a> for the second time in three months as it benefited from back-to-school spending, despite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8138bbe4-3c45-469e-9a47-a67c7b0e3df5#post-ec814dd4-5f84-4000-add1-ec08ba9af6fe\">US consumer confidence waning</a> over the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus. Rival <strong>Target, </strong>seen as one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4029a256-9653-4859-b5da-4e4c0ad22c52\">big winners from the pandemic</a>, also reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4eb3ae37-1ba5-49fa-a8b5-0b85c8181ec4#post-dc356c4a-70e2-483a-b963-4f011507d36e\">strong sales</a> for the three months to the end of July.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><strong>Eric Rosengren</strong>, president of the Boston Fed, called for a swift end to the central bank's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bafad111-01e5-4600-b34c-13028c3826ea\">emergency bond-buying programme</a>. He joins other hawkish voices in suggesting the bank could begin tapering purchases this year as it makes progress on inflation and jobs targets. Minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting are published at 2pm ET on Wednesday. </p> <p>Rating agencies warned that current easy access to <strong>corporate finance</strong> in the US could lead to a wave of defaults after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32a57864-d983-46b0-bbfa-85fd2d2361e5\">‘clear signs of risk taking'</a>. Companies had already borrowed record amounts to cope with the pandemic downturn in 2020, while sales of low-grade debt this year are set to reach an all-time high.</p> <p>Dividends for <strong>UK investment trusts</strong> fell 3.1 per cent in the first half of 2021 compared with the year before — the first drop <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb68dd22-48dc-48e3-abee-7f17a353ed78\">since the aftermath of the global financial crisis</a> — as pandemic-era cuts from companies filtered through. Despite the drop, payouts for trusts have performed relatively well against the wider market and advocates believe them to be well-suited to cope with “market dislocations”.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>EuropeaninBritain</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb7c3f69-7b03-4536-b455-d88088076a7c?commentID=4efc24d1-8e5c-437c-9f32-c1012755c6de\">‘It's a tough life': Hospitality crisis deepens chef shortages</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Many bigger chains are failing to pay even the so called London Living Wage of £10.80, which is the first reason. Secondly, the UK and particularly London, has lost its name and reputation as a good place to be and work. Many who left in the pandemic will not return because they have either found their native countries can offer much more, or they found better pay and conditions closer to home on the continent. Lastly, training kitchen porters to become chefs in a short time only explains the drop in food and service quality and rise in factory pre-made concept across the UK's dining scene. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>“A world grappling with the twin threats of pandemic and climate emergency deserves an apocalyptic reading list,” says management editor Andrew Hill. Take your pick from the longlist for the Financial Times and McKinsey <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2529e4d9-0ca2-4bec-bc14-8d6626651408\">Business Book of the Year Award</a>.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Should remote workers be paid less?'
