  "title": "Lyft and Uber's fork on road to profit",
  "text": "<p>Lyft has just won the race to profitability ahead of its ride-hailing rival Uber, but there are hopeful signs that the latter is not far behind.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Lyft<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/lyft-earnings-q2-2021.html\"> reported its first adjusted profit</a> — a modest $23.8m — a quarter ahead of target and said it expected to maintain profitability from now on. It benefited from the easing of Covid-19 restrictions as riders returned to using its service, although it had to spend more to attract drivers back to accommodate them.</p> <p>Lyft is a one-dimensional company compared to Uber, serving the US market and focusing on taxi services, while its rival is international and is tackling food and grocery deliveries as well.</p> <p>On Wednesday,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b961f11-5228-4d59-ae1e-14e819677325\"> Uber fell well short</a> of Wall Street estimates for an adjusted loss of $325m, as it recorded a $509m one, but it reiterated its goal of posting a quarterly profit by the end of the year. Incentives to lure back drivers were blamed for the poor results, with Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi saying the majority of the drivers attracted back were “resurrected” workers who had returned to the platform, with the company reverting to “good old-fashioned phone calls” to get them back on board.</p> <p>Spending on incentives is easing now and there is no current price war with Lyft, so profitability could be closer. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say they remain bullish on Uber, with its Eats delivery business holding up well and also attracting people to use the ride-hailing service. <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/how-it-works/uber-pass/\">Uber Pass,</a> a monthly subscription service that gives savings on rides and delivery, is driving 30 per cent of delivery bookings and the on-demand grocery service has partnerships with the Albertsons, Walgreens and Costco chains.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6add6eeb-77e4-45d7-82a0-d0c8ce166c61\">Lex says </a>Uber always seems to be on the cusp of proving it can make money, before disappointing with unexpected costs, and it is little wonder that its shares are still below its IPO price. Regulation remains a hard-to-price threat to profits too and if Uber is forced to pay more benefits to its drivers then its goal of sustained profitability may be a milestone moved even further into the distance.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Apple plans iPhone scanning — exclusive</strong><br>Apple intends to install software on American iPhones to scan for child abuse imagery,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14440f81-d405-452f-97e2-a81458f5411f\"> report Madhumita Murgia and Tim Bradshaw</a>, raising alarm among security researchers who warn that it could open the door to surveillance of millions of people's personal devices. Apple detailed its proposed system — known as “neuralMatch” — to some US academics earlier this week.</p> <p><strong>2. Indian Supreme Court may review phone spyware</strong><br>India's Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d6c9e0b-bb66-4387-ba70-9db8f70d6348\">begun hearing journalists' pleas </a>for an independent, court-supervised investigation into allegations that Narendra Modi's government misused spyware to surveil opposition politicians, reporters and officials. Traces of NSO Group's Pegasus software were found on the smartphones of an opposition political strategist and seven Indian journalists.</p> <p><strong>3. Walmart's Flipkart faces big Indian fine</strong><br>Indian authorities are<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85207008-5510-43a1-9867-dd7d85767678\"> threatening to fine </a>Walmart-owned ecommerce group Flipkart and its founders for alleged historic violations of the country's foreign investment laws. Flipkart confirmed on Thursday that it was under investigation by the country's Enforcement Directorate, with reports saying the group faced a fine of $1.35bn.</p> <p><strong>4. ByteDance forced to retrench in education</strong><br>TikTok owner ByteDance has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52649a5b-e4b2-4e83-8b68-d903a7697747\">started lay-offs </a>at its education division after new Chinese government regulations made some of its businesses illegal. The Beijing-based company had acquired half a dozen companies in recent years and announced plans in February to recruit 10,000 more employees, but several thousand may now be let go.&#xa0;Investors in other education companies are exploring how to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45c0c4c3-b578-4aac-8aed-ea4267633834\">claw back their capital.</a></p> <p><strong>5. Rakuten's 5G lifeline</strong><br>Japan's biggest ecommerce group may have just found its salvation. Rakuten has won its first contract to export 5G network-building technology to German wireless carrier 1&amp;1. It is the turnround opportunity the lossmaking company needs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0eaeb287-cbc2-48d3-8115-9b27967a3a3b\">says Lex</a>.</p> <h2>Forwarded from&#xa0;Sifted&#xa0;—&#xa0;the European start-up week</h2> <p>Berlin-based&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/gorillas-doordash/\">grocery start-up Gorillas</a>&#xa0;is in talks to raise a new funding round led by the US's largest food delivery company DoorDash, potentially valuing the company at around $2.25bn. This may seem like a big number, but it is a far cry from the $6bn valuation that Gorillas was hoping to get earlier this year, according to sources close to the company. This comes&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/gorillas-wework/\">amid signs of internal strife at&#xa0;Gorillas</a>,&#xa0;which has been hit&#xa0;by protests by its delivery riders in Berlin and it has also been accused of arbitrary firings and a hostile environment at the HQ.<br><br>In other&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/rankings/european-startups-top-rankings\">European start-up</a>&#xa0;news this week, UK-based events company&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/hopin-fundraise-series-d/\">Hopin said that it had raised another $450m</a>&#xa0;in funding, valuing the company at $7.75bn just months after closing a previous round. The raise cements Hopin's position as the fastest-growing European tech start-up of all time and one of Europe's largest private companies. It's another sign of accelerating fundraising timelines for fast-growing companies in Europe. Finally, Sifted this week looked at how&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/startups-super-soldiers/\">armies were turning to young companies for a technical edge</a>&#xa0;and at the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/rankings/parisian-startups-top-rankings\">Parisian start-ups to watch in 2021</a>.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Google's new Nests</h2> <p>Google today<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-google-nest-latest-cams-and-doorbells-are-here/\"> launched a new generation</a> of Nest Cams and an update on its Doorbell.
