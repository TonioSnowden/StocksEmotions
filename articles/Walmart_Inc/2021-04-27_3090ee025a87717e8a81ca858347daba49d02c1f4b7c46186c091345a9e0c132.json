Now the Australian financier<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cca3ab83-22d6-4bc3-8c24-1208e1c0f981\"> is at the centre</a> of Britain's biggest lobbying scandal in a generation.</p> <p>While the political fallout from <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>'s rise and fall is now dominating British newspaper front pages, there is a bigger corporate finance story lurking in the background that is only just getting going: <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>.</p> <p>The 49-year-old trader-turned-industrialist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b52c95c-83bb-4c17-9ed8-d28320cbab7f\">has also proved</a> himself a savvy political operator, beguiling politicians across the spectrum with his vision of a greener steel industry.</p> <p>Gupta has in a few short years stitched together a sprawling metals-to-banking conglomerate, through an acquisition spree of steel plants and other ageing industrial assets, which has seen his so-called <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> hit $20bn in annual revenues.</p> <p>And much of the financial firepower underpinning that rise came from the now-collapsed Greensill Capital, which disclosed in court last month that it had an eye-watering $5bn of debt exposure to Gupta's businesses.</p> <p>The so-called saviour of steel has more than just the collapse of his main lender to contend with.</p> <p>A recent run of Financial Times investigations have shone an uncomfortable light on <strong>Liberty Commodities</strong>, the trading firm the Indian-born businessman says he established from a Cambridge university dorm room in 1992.</p> <p>The company advertises itself as “one of the leading independent non-ferrous traders”, with annual turnover of more than $6bn. But the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e450c8f9-29fa-432b-98fd-5885edb4680f\">revealed</a> earlier this month that some of the invoices it has raised financing against appear to be dubious.</p> <p>Companies named on the paperwork deny doing business with Liberty, raising suspicions of fraud. In a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29488e0a-8e4d-4989-ba4c-b1e26872851d\">letter to the FT</a> expressing his disappointment with the article, Gupta said he refuted “any suggestion of wrongdoing”.</p> <p>Now the FT has revealed just how much of Liberty Commodities' revenue has at times relied on a loose network of related companies, which insiders call the “Friends of Sanjeev”.</p> <p>While ostensibly independent, employees of the GFG Alliance were often deeply involved in their administration, at times co-ordinating audits, signing loan documents on their behalf and even helping set up corporate websites.</p> <p>The FT has been able to piece together the ways these seemingly independent entities are interwoven with one another — through a revolving door of shareholders and directors — using public records, together with interviews with people directly involved in many of the transactions.</p> <p>Go deeper with DD's Rob Smith and the FT's Cynthia O'Murchu and Michael Pooler <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca5f4d3-6ae1-46ce-8729-ce2f2d4ab9f7\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The incoming Credit Suisse chair opens up over lunch&#xa0;</h2> <p>Lunches with the FT can be notoriously riotous affairs.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/864c3a96-fbf1-11e5-b5f5-070dca6d0a0d\">shared</a> six pints of ale, a bottle of wine and two glasses of port in 2016, while <strong>Richard Desmond</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2915b0b8-0f67-11e5-897e-00144feabdc0\">once nonchalantly added</a> a £580 bottle of château Palmer to the FT's tab.</p> <p>Not so with <strong>António Horta-Osório</strong>, the outgoing <strong>Lloyds Bank</strong> boss and incoming <strong>Credit Suisse </strong>chair.&#xa0;</p> <p>The tennis fanatic has been on something of a fitness drive throughout lockdown, skipping breakfast and taking early morning 5km runs four times a week. In the process, he lost 3kg.</p> <p>During <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6140672-bc98-4c38-913c-75af869803c3\">his recent lunch with the</a> FT's Patrick Jenkins, the Portuguese banker avoided alcohol and pudding, settling instead for dressed crab, Dover sole and his trademark green tea.</p> <p>Horta-Osório knows more than most about the importance of staying physically and mentally healthy when taking on high-octane jobs. Within months of being parachuted into the part-nationalised Lloyds in 2011, he was diagnosed with stress-related exhaustion and sent to the Priory clinic to recover.</p> <p>“The reason why I really stopped sleeping is because I could see that the bank could die,” the 57-year-old told the FT. “I could not share this with anyone. I took it really to heart as my responsibility to save it.”</p> <p>Horta-Osório faces an equally daunting challenge as he joins Credit Suisse next week.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Swiss lender has been pummeled by twin crises surrounding <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> and <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong> in recent months. These have come on the back of a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb708ba2-ea8c-4c66-9190-0255fa5112e3\"> series of calamities</a> stretching back over several years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last week Credit Suisse went<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7a958d0-3fc0-456a-9f01-3077b772e41b\"> cap in hand</a> to its shareholders, seeking to raise $1.9bn to help bolster its balance sheet.</p> <p>It is fair to say the bank's shareholders are not overjoyed with its recent escapades. Several told the FT this week that they planned to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93e6ef82-7280-496e-8af5-ba84a24a639d\"> vote against</a> <strong>Andreas Gottschling</strong>, the Credit Suisse board member in charge of risk oversight, at the group's AGM on Friday.</p> <p>Horta-Osório's abstinence may well be tested in the months ahead.</p> <h2>The revolving door and Jones Day</h2> <p>When it came to<strong> Donald Trump</strong>'s presidency and big law, <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcbd038f-23a3-4c8d-81e0-867ed84ea8a7\">was most often </a>seen as the law firm with the closest ties to the US president. That was largely thanks to alumni such as <strong>Bill Barr</strong>, who served as Trump's attorney-general.&#xa0;</p> <p>But when it comes to enduring links to the Trump movement and Republican party politics, <strong>Jones Day</strong> is the firm to watch.&#xa0;</p> <p>Founded over a century ago in Cleveland, Ohio, Jones Day once made its name representing businesses in the industrial Midwest, including <strong>Standard Oil</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But in recent decades, it has developed into a powerhouse in Washington, where its prominence is symbolised by the proximity of its office to the US Capitol.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>However, its relationship with those running the US reached new heights during the Trump presidency.&#xa0;</p> <p>The firm earned more than $25m in fees from the Trump campaign and funnelled more lawyers into positions in the administration than any other. The list <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb033782-ab98-11e8-94bd-cba20d67390c\">included</a> <strong>Don McGahn</strong>, Trump's first White House counsel.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now those lawyers are flocking back to the firm. But its closeness to the former president and by extension, the far-right movement in the US, has rattled some within its ranks.&#xa0;</p> <p>Jones Day is notoriously secretive, even by the standards of its big law rivals. Insiders call its compensation system a “black box” and managing partner <strong>Stephen Brogan</strong> has ruled the roost for almost two decades with unusually broad discretion to control its operations.&#xa0;</p> <p>Go deeper with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4cb0ae4-bf18-4cd5-bce8-b7436f4e3fe6\">this look at the firm</a>, which employs about 2,500 lawyers and makes over $2bn in revenue annually, by the FT's Kate Beioley and DD's Arash Massoudi.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Private equity firm <strong>Searchlight Capital Partners</strong> has appointed<strong> Ajit Pai</strong>, former chair of the<strong> US Federal Communications Commission</strong>, as a partner.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bernd Osterloh</strong>, the head of <strong>Volkswagen</strong>'s works council, which represents most of the manufacturer's 300,000 workers in Germany, is leaving the post to become head of human resources at truck-subsidiary <strong>Traton</strong>, and will be replaced by his deputy<strong> Daniela Cavallo</strong>. His resignation was greeted with silent relief by VW's top brass. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fda38e53-c045-49d7-9909-c4b92604dfe9\">Read why here.&#xa0;</a></p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone </strong>has hired former <strong>LeumiTech</strong> chief <strong>Yifat Oron</strong>, as a senior managing director and head of the firm's new office in Tel Aviv. She was previously the chief executive of an Israeli tech banking platform and before that a partner at a venture capital firm.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart listens</h2> <p><strong>A secretive world</strong> This BBC profile takes you inside the lives of Mohsin and Zuber Issa, the brothers from Blackburn who run a debt-fuelled petrol station empire and have just bought UK supermarket chain Asda — though they hate being described as billionaires.

Though CVC walked away, another firm could step up to the plate.
