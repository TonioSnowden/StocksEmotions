  "title": "U.S. News: Child Care's High Cost and Low Availability Hit Home in Iowa",
  "text": "<p>In Iowa and around the country, in blue and red states alike, the cost of child care is weighing down families, one of several compounding problems in a sector that politicians of both parties agree is in need of reform.</p><p>Some families spend nearly one-third of their income on child care. Parents are competing for limited options. As more people leave the workforce or demand higher pay, child-care centers can't find staff willing to work for little more than minimum wage.</p><p>The rapid spread of the Omicron variant is making things worse. Parents, children and child-care providers are contracting the virus in record numbers, further straining the economy.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans in Washington say they recognize the problem, but disagree on the solutions. The prospect of a remedy from the narrowly divided Congress remains a long shot, but some lawmakers have said there is enough common ground to forge bipartisan compromise.</p><p>Democrats have proposed spending hundreds of billions of dollars to remake the country's child-care system, which they describe as the biggest federal child-care investment in history. Their proposal would subsidize child care for many Americans, while seeking to raise wages for workers, increase the number of child-care providers and improve the quality of care.</p><p>\"It can make it possible for people who might be on the margin now between working and not working to make that decision to be in the labor force or be in the labor force for longer hours,\" Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said of the Democrats' proposal.</p><p>But the Democrats' plans, which are included in broader education, healthcare and climate-change legislation, are stalled in the Senate after Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) raised concerns about the overall spending levels in the bill. Mr. Manchin's vote in the 50-50 Senate is key because Democrats hope to pass their social-spending legislation without Republican support.</p><p>Senate Republicans are unanimously opposed to the broader social-spending package and some have specifically criticized the child-care proposal, arguing it could end up making it harder for families to find care. If the measure does pass, some GOP governors could choose to opt out of the program.</p><p>Republicans in Congress have proposed several child-care measures, but the GOP hasn't coalesced around one plan. GOP lawmakers have called for expanding tax credits to employers who provide on-site care and giving child-care providers additional support through grants and Small Business Administration programs.</p><p>Iowa exemplifies the problems playing out around the nation. The number of child-care programs in the state decreased 56% during the last decade, and the number of available spaces for children dropped by 6%, according to data compiled by Iowa Child Care Resource and Referral, a nonprofit that provides child-care consultation, technical assistance and training. Child-care workers make as little as $8-to-$10 an hour.</p><p>Judy Wolf, president of the Marita Theisen Childcare Center in Dubuque, said most of her new workers have quit within 90 days because they can make more money working at McDonald's or Walmart.</p><p>Under the Democrats' proposal, an eligible family of four in Iowa making $68,568 or less wouldn't pay for child care. A family making $114,280 -- 125% of the state median -- would pay about $4,571 a year, or 4% of their income. A family making more than $228,560 -- 250% of the median -- would pay for the full cost of child care out of pocket.</p><p>To qualify for the subsidies, parents must be working or engaged in other activities like going to school.</p><p>The legislation also seeks to expand the market of licensed child-care providers; by some estimates, more than half of the U.S. population lives in areas without enough licensed facilities.</p><p>Brittany Graham, 29, spent more than four months looking for child care for her toddler daughter. Open spots are so hard to find in this part of northeastern Iowa that she is coordinating with her child-care provider about when she should have a second baby.</p><p>She said she was the 120th person on a waiting list at one day-care center. \"By the time you give me a call, my child won't be an infant anymore,\" Ms. Graham said she told workers at the center.</p>",
