  "title": "Costco Shareholder Vote Signals Focus on Supply-Chain Emissions; Shareholders voted for a resolution calling for a tougher climate plan, against the wishes of the retailer's board",
  "text": "<p>The company's board opposed the proposal. \"While we seek and will continue to seek to influence our suppliers to reduce their emissions, we cannot directly control their actions,\" Costco said in its statement against the resolution.</p><p>Shareholder resolutions aren't legally binding in the U.S., but they can put pressure on companies to make changes and raise the possibility that investors could vote to remove executives if they refuse to take action.</p><p>A Costco spokeswoman said the company's board \"will consider the vote and take further action as appropriate.\" She added that Costco takes climate change seriously and has a climate plan. Ahead of its shareholder meeting, Costco said it would cut emissions from its operations and energy purchases by 2% a year, which doesn't include its supply chain.</p><p>Support for shareholder proposals on greenhouse-gas emissions rose to an average of around 59% last year, compared with 25% in 2017, according to Heidi Welsh, director of the nonprofit Sustainable Investments Institute.</p><p>\"With all of the majority votes, proponents are going into 2022 with a lot of momentum,\" Ms. Welsh said.</p><p>U.S. companies are facing 57 votes on greenhouse-gas emissions this year, though many will likely be withdrawn if investors reach agreements with management, Ms. Welsh said. Last year, there were 10 such votes.</p><p>\"Investors are going to hold companies' feet to the fire,\" she said.</p><p>Proposals specifically covering supply-chain emissions and scientific recommendations on climate change are a newer focus for investors, she said.</p><p>\"The supply-chain impacts for climate, for labor, it all is of interest because it has an impact from the sustainable investors' perspective on the company's business,\" Ms. Welsh said. \"It's seen as affecting the bottom line if companies don't attend to all of their emissions.\"</p><p>Tracking and reducing supply-chain emissions is a challenge for many companies, but it is particularly difficult for retailers, according to CDP, which runs a global carbon disclosure system. The nonprofit estimated last year that retailers' Scope 3 emissions were 28.3 times greater than their operational emissions, one of the highest among the sectors it reviewed.</p><p>\"Investors are demonstrating that they expect Costco to align with its peers,\" said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management Inc., which filed the resolution and holds nearly $6 million in Costco stock. The environmentally focused fund manager said Costco is among a few of the biggest U.S. companies that don't have a major climate commitment.</p><p>\"It's likely a wake-up call for other companies,\" she said.</p><p>Despite the challenges in managing supply chains, other large U.S. retailers have greenhouse-gas emission targets that follow scientific recommendations. Competitors Walmart Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Target Corp. have plans that cover their supply chains, which won endorsements from the Science Based Targets initiative, a nonprofit group that checks whether corporate plans to limit climate change align with the Paris agreement.</p><p>Walmart aims to avoid a gigaton of greenhouse-gas emissions from its supply chain by 2030. It rewards suppliers that help it get there. Last year, Walmart launched a program that pays suppliers earlier if they score higher with CDP.</p><p>In its statement against the resolution, Costco said transitioning to a low-carbon business model poses a \"monumental challenge\" for the company. Costco said it would work over the next three fiscal years to determine its emissions and a course of action that considers scientific recommendations.</p><p>\"We need more time to determine how we can achieve meaningful and operationally-viable absolute CO2 [equivalent] reductions in our operations and our global value chain,\" Costco said.</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Costco Shareholder Vote Signals Focus on Supply-Chain Emissions</p>",
