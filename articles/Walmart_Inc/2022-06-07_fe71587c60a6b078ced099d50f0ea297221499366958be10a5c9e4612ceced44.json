  "title": "Target Warns Profit Will Drop Because It Has Too Much Inventory; The retailer is discounting excess inventory to make way for in-demand goods",
  "text": "<p>Big retailers benefited over the past two years from the pandemic rush to buy patio furniture, laptops and home d√©cor, as shoppers were buoyed by savings and government stimulus checks. Now many of those same stores are grappling with a swift reversal of buying behavior with consumers spending less on goods in favor of services and necessities such as food and fuel.</p><p>Two weeks after reporting lower-than-expected profits, Target said Tuesday it will further reduce some of its profit estimates for the year because it will more quickly unload excess inventory in the current quarter. Target said last month inventory rose 43% in the most recent quarter as demand for outdoor furniture, small appliances and some electronics declined faster than expected and supply-chain snarls delayed the arrival of many goods past the ideal selling window.</p><p>\"We've had some additional time after earnings to really evaluate the overall operating environment,\" said Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell in an interview. That includes watching consumer behavior as they face high rates of inflation, he said, and seeing many other retailers talk about high inventory levels during their earnings presentations. \"We have to be decisive and get out in front of this to make sure this doesn't linger through the back half of the year.\"</p><p>Target shares fell more than 9% in premarket trading. The company's stock price is down 31% for the year as of Monday, compared with a roughly 14% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Dealing with the excess inventory as quickly as possible could benefit Target if it is able to restock its shelves with more in-demand inventory later in the year while competitors are still working through excess items, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Target said it aims to cancel orders when possible or use promotions to remove all excess inventory during the current quarter. Canceling will result in additional fines, while discounting reduces the profitability of each sale. Mr. Cornell wants the inventory cleared out to fully stock stores with products in high demand such as food, beauty products and back-to-school items, he said.</p><p>Target now expects its second-quarter operating margin rate will be in a range around 2%, down from its late-May estimate of around 5.3%. For the full year the company expects to be slightly below earlier forecasts because of the moves it is making in the second quarter, said Mr. Cornell.</p><p>In May Target said it expected full-year operating margin to fall in a range around 6%. The company continues to expect full-year revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digit percent range.</p><p>Target's lower profit estimates are the latest sign that many retailers are struggling to navigate a rapidly changing environment. Sales are growing at many retailers, but profits have suffered as costs rise amid inflation and consumers spend more of their disposable income on experiences such as travel, entertainment and dining out.</p><p>Walmart Inc. posted lower-than-expected profits when it reported earnings last month, in part because of labor costs that were higher than it anticipated and spending shifts. Walmart, the country's largest retailer by revenue, also reported inventory was up around 33% in the most recent quarter. The rise reflected buying behavior, the higher costs of goods because of inflation and a sudden uptick in goods moving through U.S. ports after Walmart earlier bought products aggressively to meet demand.</p><p>At Walmart's annual shareholder meeting last week, executives said around 20% of the elevated inventory consists of items the company wishes it didn't have, but much of the rest is to restock shelves or sell later this year. \"It's going to take this quarter and probably part of next, maybe a couple of quarters would be the best way to describe it, to get back to where we want to be,\" said John Furner, head of Walmart U.S.</p><p>The rise of inventory is likely to lead to more discounts, something retailers had avoided during the product scarcity of the pandemic. Gap Inc., Macy's Inc. and other apparel retailers said they resorted to discounting in recent months to clear out excess inventory of products such as casual clothes as more people dress for returning to the office and travel.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How have your spending habits shifted in the past year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Macy's net sales jumped 13.6% in the spring quarter compared with a year before. But Macy's said markdowns to clear the excess inventory would weigh on profit margins going forward and warned of higher promotional levels throughout the industry as other retailers do the same. Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in an interview in late May that the shift away from casual clothes to more dressy attire was dramatic and happened faster than the company had anticipated.</p><p>Target is also adjusting sales forecasts, promotion plans and cost expectations by category. The retailer is planning for more demand in food and beverage and beauty, and reducing expectations for categories such as home, the company said Tuesday. Target also said it is pursuing options to cut costs, including through negotiations with vendors.</p><p>\"We were chasing hard in 2021 to get more of the inventory that our guest was looking for,\" said Mr. Cornell. \"Unfortunately we ran into delays. Inventory arrived late. Now that it is here the demand signal has changed.\"</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Target Warns Profit Will Drop Because It Has Too Much Inventory</p>",
