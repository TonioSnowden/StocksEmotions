  "text": "<p>\"We understand this was a moment that can never be forgotten, particularly for the surviving associates,\" he wrote. \"We'll work closely with the team to decide how and when we might remodel and reopen in a way that will help them move forward.\"</p><p>Mr. Furner said the retail giant was paying for funeral, travel and other expenses for families of the employees who were killed. \"We're so sorry, and we're here for you,\" he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, a Walmart store worker who survived the shooting filed a lawsuit against the company claiming she complained about harassing behavior by Mr. Bing two months before the incident.</p><p>Donya Prioleau, 27, said she filed a formal written ethics complaint on Sept. 10 about inappropriate remarks by Mr. Bing including about her age and appearance, according to the suit. Her mother also visited the store that same day to speak with the store manager, the suit claims.</p><p>The 11-page lawsuit, filed in Chesapeake Circuit Court, doesn't say that Ms. Prioleau told the company or managers that Mr. Bing was dangerous. It seeks $50 million in damages.</p><p>A Walmart spokesman said the company is reviewing the complaint and will respond with the court. The company said it is conducting an investigation and supporting employees and their families.</p><p>Ms. Prioleau says she was at the store last week and witnessed Mr. Bing shoot several of her colleagues, according to the suit. She had been employed with Walmart as an overnight stocker since last spring, according to the lawsuit, and Mr. Bing was her manager. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Bing had been disciplined on several occasions for behavior, including allegedly bullying and harassing other employees.</p><p>Before the shooting, the lawsuit claims that Mr. Bing had told store employees, including managers, that if he was ever fired he would retaliate and repeatedly asked co-workers if they had received their active-shooter training.</p><p>Mr. Bing could be combative and difficult to work with, according to two former co-workers. In interviews with The Wall Street Journal, they said he would cover his cellphone camera with tape because he said he worried the government was tracking him.</p><p>Mr. Bing—who had worked at Walmart since 2010, according to the company—left a \"death note\" that police said they retrieved from his cellphone. In it he claimed that he had been the target of bullying. He wrote, \"I was harassed by idiots with low intelligence and a lack of wisdom.\"</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Says Chesapeake Store Will Remain Closed After Shooting, Will Continue to Pay Staffers</p>",
