  "title": "Business News:  Dollar Tree Fights Rising Costs  ----  By Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>    Dollar Tree Inc. is famous for selling most of its products -- from a pair of flip-flops to a small bottle of detergent -- for a dollar apiece. </p><p>   The strategy, which draws in loyal shoppers looking for bargains, has left the discount chain with less room than rivals to manage rising costs this year. The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed up transportation rates, workers' wages and prices for some raw materials. </p><p>   \"We are still going to deliver at a dollar as our customers have expected for over 30 years,\" said Michael Witynski, a grocery veteran who joined Dollar Tree in 2010 and took over as its chief executive a year ago. The challenge, he said in a recent interview, is to continue to find ways to buy products such as holiday decorations, snacks and craft supplies for around 43 cents, then charge $1 to shoppers. </p><p>    Prices are rising for a range of goods and services as shipping and manufacturing remain snarled by the pandemic and other factors. At the same time, demand for many products is high while U.S. consumers continue to emerge from last year's lockdowns. In many cases, consumer-goods companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and General Mills Inc. are passing those price increases onto consumers. For a chain that attracts shoppers with mostly $1 products, adapting can be more challenging. </p><p>   The majority of Dollar Tree's products are store brands, which gives it flexibility in an inflationary environment. Last year Dollar Tree changed the packaging on a bestselling over-the-door metal hanger, Mr. Witynski said, moving to a smaller, less-expensive cardboard hook for shelf display. The retailer started shipping $1 gift bags, another big seller, in boxes of 72, up from 24 to save on shipping costs, he said. Cartons of fresh eggs fluctuate between 18, 12 or 6 packs, depending on costs. </p><p>   The company is also experimenting with higher prices. It is adding some products, such as basketballs and travel neck pillows, for $3 and $5 in some Dollar Tree stores. It's also building what it dubs \"combo stores,\" a location that combines a Dollar Tree with a Family Dollar, a chain the company bought in 2015 that sells products at many price points. In total, the company has nearly 16,000 U.S. locations. </p><p>   Some investors worry this year is different from decades past. Dollar Tree has \"benefited for the majority of the 35 years, and certainly 25 years as a public company, from operating in a very low inflationary environment,\" said Peter Keith, retail analyst at Piper Sandler, which downgraded his rating on the stock last month. </p><p>   Around 70% of Dollar Tree workers are part-timers, according to financial filings, which leaves the company exposed because part-time wages are rising amid competition for hourly staff and laws that raise the minimum wage, Mr. Keith said. Dollar Tree's current small rollout of higher-priced products won't be enough to offset wage, shipping and other cost increases, he predicts. </p><p>   A Dollar Tree spokesman said wage pressure isn't new to the company. \"We have managed throughout and will continue to do so,\" he said. </p><p>   During the pandemic Dollar Tree's sales increased more slowly than other discount competitors such as Dollar General Corp. and Walmart Inc. That is because the chain sells more discretionary items such as party supplies at a time when people didn't have parties and instead were spending more on food and household goods, Mr. Witynski said. </p><p>   Dollar Tree stores are mostly in suburban locations and target middle-income shoppers browsing knickknacks for fun. Its Family Dollar chain, like Dollar General, targets lower-income families and sells items at different price points. Dollar General stores are concentrated in rural areas, while nearly half of Family Dollar stores are in urban locations. </p><p>   Dollar Tree's stock is down around 8% so far this year, while the overall market has climbed, including many retail competitors who have benefited from pandemic buying trends. Dollar General shares are up about 15% so far this year. </p><p></p>",
