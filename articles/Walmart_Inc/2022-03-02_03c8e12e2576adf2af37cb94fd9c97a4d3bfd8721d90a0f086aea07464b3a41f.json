  "title": "Increased Store Traffic  Boosts Target's Revenue  ----  By Sarah Nassauer and Charity L. Scott",
  "text": "<p>   After a two-year pandemic run that brought Target Corp. billions in sales, the retailer wants to keep growing by building more stores and e-commerce hubs and new lines of business. </p><p>   Sales grew at the Minneapolis-based retailer in the most recent quarter, helped by stronger traffic in its stores through the holiday season and growth across its merchandise categories including food, apparel and home goods. </p><p>   Strong revenue growth helped offset higher supply-chain costs and spending on wages for Target. Earnings rose nearly 12% from a year earlier to $1.54 billion, or $3.21 a share. Earnings excluding items also came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts. </p><p>   Comparable sales, which include sales from stores or digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 8.9% in the quarter ended Jan. 29 from a year prior, the company said. Digital sales increased 9.2%. </p><p>   For the full year, Target's revenue hit $106 billion, compared with $77.1 billion for the year ended Feb. 1, 2020, before the pandemic upended the global economy and consumer buying patterns. </p><p>   Other large retailers such as Walmart Inc. reported strong sales growth in the latest fiscal year, including the holiday shopping period. Those retailers were able to use their heft and e-commerce networks to navigate worker shortages due to the Omicron variant, supply-chain snarls and rising prices. </p><p>   Smaller retail chains, such as Kohl's Corp., have said delays on inventory arriving in stores dampened sales growth and pandemic complexities ate into profits in recent months. </p><p>   Consumer spending remains strong even as prices rise. In January spending rose a seasonally adjusted 2.1% from the previous month, with personal income staying steady, the Commerce Department said. </p><p>   Surveys, however, are showing an increasingly dour mood among consumers through the latest phase of the pandemic combined with the effects of inflation among other developments. </p><p>   \"Consumers are still worried about Covid, but they are looking for that touch of normal in their lives,\" Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell told analysts Tuesday. </p><p>   The financial performance through the first two pandemic years will be difficult for many retailers to replicate. Target expects revenue and adjusted earnings per share to increase this year at a slower pace than 2021. Kohl's, which also reported quarterly financial results Tuesday, forecast net sales in fiscal 2022 to increase 2% to 3%, compared with the nearly 22% increase the previous year. </p><p>   Target is focusing on investing in its stores while also growing digital sales, company executives told analysts at a New York event Tuesday. Around 19% of Target's total sales are now digital, up from 8.8% in 2019. Most of those sales come from store inventory -- store workers packing up orders for home delivery or to bring to customers in parking lots. </p><p>   The company is building large warehouses that use automation to quickly pack same-day delivery orders near city centers such as Chicago, to expand the business faster, executives said. It also plans to expand Roundel, its internal media operation that works with brands and ad agencies, to be a $2 billion operation over the next several years. </p><p>   Target shares rose about 10% in Tuesday trading. </p><p>   Kohl's is banking on partnerships like one it has with beauty-products seller Sephora to help lift its sales. It also plans to invest in its physical locations, including moving merchandise like activewear to the front of stores. </p><p>   The department-store chain's latest report also comes as it fends off criticisms from activist investors. It rejected a $9 billion takeover offer from a consortium backed by hedge fund Starboard Value LP. That rejection garnered criticism from Jonathan Duskin, the manager partner of Macellum Advisors GP LLC, which has a roughly 5% stake in the retailer and has pushed for board changes. </p><p>   On Tuesday CEO Michelle Gass pushed back on criticism that the company's board isn't open to opportunities to boost shareholder value. Kohl's also said that it would double its quarterly dividend and buy back at least $1 billion of its stock this year, which Ms. Gass said in an interview is a testament to the company's confidence in its strategy. </p><p>   \"While we have tremendous confidence in our future, we are testing and assessing that plan against other alternatives,\" she said. </p><p>   Kohl's shares rose roughly 2%. </p><p>   In response to inflation, Target aims to keep prices lower than competitors during the current year, executives said. \"We have many levers to combat costs, and price is the one we pull last, not first,\" according to the company's chief financial officer, Michael Fiddelke. </p><p>   The company expects the tight labor market and supply-chain snarls to continue this year and is watching consumer spending without the benefit of government stimulus, he said. </p><p>   On Monday, Target said it would offer hourly workers a minimum wage of $15 to $24, and expand the pool of employees eligible for company health benefits. </p><p></p>",
