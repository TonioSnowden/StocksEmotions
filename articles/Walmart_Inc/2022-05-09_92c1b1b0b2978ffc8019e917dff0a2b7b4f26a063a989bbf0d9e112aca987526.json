  "text": "<p>Wm Morrison has won the battle for McColl's with a last-minute offer for the crisis-hit&#xa0;convenience store chain that beat a rival bid from petrol station operator EG Group.</p> <p>The grocer said on Monday that it would buy McColl's out of administration, taking on all of its 1,160 stores, staff and two pension schemes with more than 2,000 members.</p> <p>The convenience store group has debts of about £145mn and its lenders, as of last summer, included Barclays, HSBC and Bank of Ireland. Morrisons' offer comprises repaying the secured debt in full, with “a distribution also expected to unsecured creditors”.</p> <p>The sale is likely to protect many of the 16,000 jobs that were at risk in the event of McColl's collapse. But Morrisons, which is owned by the private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, has made no assurances as to what would happen to underperforming McColl's stores.</p> <p>The outcome will be a blow to EG, whose owners, the billionaire Issa brothers, also control grocery chain Asda. EG's offer to buy McColl's had been favoured on Friday night and would have prevailed had delays to the formal appointment of an administrator not given Morrisons more time this weekend to make a counter offer.</p> <p>David Potts, Morrisons chief executive, said the deal was a “good outcome for McColl's” although he was “disappointed that the business was put into administration”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“This transaction offers stability and continuity for the McColl's business and, in particular, a better outcome for its colleagues and pensioners,” he said. </p> <p>McColl's already has close commercial ties with Morrisons, which remains a supplier and its largest unsecured creditor. Morrisons said in its most recent trading update that it had an exposure to McColl's of up to £130mn, mostly consisting of stock.</p> <p>McColl's operates 270 outlets run under the Morrisons Daily brand, a joint venture that was set to grow to 450 shops by the end of the year. Potts said he would look to build “on the proven strength of the Morrisons Daily format”.</p> <p>Convenience stores such as those operated by McColl's received a trading boost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, when consumers preferred not to travel too far from home, but have since reverted to their traditional function of small top-up shops.</p> <p>McColl's was valued at about £200mn when it floated in 2014, but has found it hard to compete with larger companies such as Tesco, J Sainsbury and Co-op. After announcing it was on the brink of collapse on Thursday, McColl's market value dropped as low as £3mn.</p> <p>So-called prepack administrations happen when the buyer of a bankrupt company is lined up before administrators are appointed, and can be contentious. They tend to wipe out&#xa0;existing shareholders and also enable the new owners to pass on pension fund liabilities to the&#xa0;industry lifeboat, the Pension Protection Fund. Trustees of McColl's pension scheme&#xa0;have written to the government, asking it to ensure its members' benefits are protected.</p> <p>EG confirmed it had been “interested in rescuing McColl's business”, saying its proposal would have saved the jobs of 16,000 staff, increased hourly pay, and maintained “currently trading stores” while funding McColl's pension schemes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Morrisons' winning bid was first reported by Sky News.</p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson and Alex Barker 2022 'Morrisons wins battle for UK convenience group McColl's ' FT.com 9 May.
