CoStar last month offered to buy CoreLogic at roughly $95.76 a share, or about $6.9 billion. </p><p>\n  Stone Point Capital LLC and Insight Partners last month agreed to buy CoreLogic for $80 a share. </p><p>\n  -- Dave Sebastian </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  WALMART </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Minimum Dropped </p><p>\n  For Express Delivery </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Walmart Stores Inc. said it has dropped the $35 minimum order requirement for its two-hour express delivery service. </p><p>\n  The Bentonville, Ark., company said the move follows feedback from customers, who said they sometimes need items fast but don't meet the minimum order size for the service, which Walmart launched last year and costs $10 more than regular delivery. </p><p>\n  Walmart currently offers express delivery from nearly 3,000 stores, reaching roughly 70% of the U.S. population </p><p>\n  -- Colin Kellaher </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  TYSON FOODS </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Vaccinations Offered </p><p>\n  At Plants in Iowa </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Tyson Foods Inc. said it would offer free, on-site Covid-19 vaccinations to thousands of workers at its Iowa plants this week. </p><p>\n  The meatpacker on Monday said it expects many of its 13,000 Iowa employees to be inoculated at or near company facilities in Columbus Junction, Council Bluffs, Independence, Perry, Sioux City, Storm Lake and Waterloo. </p><p>\n  The company said more than 2,000 U.S. employees were recently vaccinated either on-site or through an external source. It said it also plans to vaccinate employees this week in Wilkesboro, N.C.; Albany, Ky.; and Noel, Mo. </p><p>\n  In December, Tyson said it fired seven managers of an Iowa plant after the companys investigation into allegations that they had wagered on Covid-19 infections among employees </p><p>\n  -- Dave Sebastian </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  DANONE </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Faber Steps Down </p><p>\n  As Chief Executive </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Emmanuel Faber said he would step down as chief executive of French yogurt maker Danone SA while remaining chairman, after calls from activist investors for him to leave both roles. </p><p>\n  The board on Monday unanimously backed Mr. Faber's plan to remain chairman while conducting a search for a successor as CEO. </p><p>\n  Artisan Partners, a U.S.-based fund that says it owns more than 3% of the company, has publicly criticized Mr. Faber for the company's lagging share price and reorganizations. </p><p>\n  -- Nick Kostov </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MACY'S </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Harper to Leave Post </p><p>\n  As Operating Chief </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Macy's Inc.
