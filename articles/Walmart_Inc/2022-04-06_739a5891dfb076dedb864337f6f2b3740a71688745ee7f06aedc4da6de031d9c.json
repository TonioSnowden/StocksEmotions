  "text": "<p>Government bonds kept selling off Wednesday, with yields rising for a fourth straight session, on the prospect of further rate increases by the Fed, after the worst quarter for U.S. bonds in more than 40 years.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose 0.05 percentage point to 2.606%, the highest level since March 2019, from 2.554% Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The Fed raised interest rates in March for the first time since 2018. Minutes from that meeting showed that central-bank officials last month considered raising rates by a half-percentage point but decided on a quarter-point increase in light of the uncertainty surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>\"Many participants noted that one or more [half-percentage-point] increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified,\" the minutes said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3% after Fed governor Lael Brainard said the central bank was strongly committed to curbing inflation. The comments by Ms. Brainard, who last year advocated sticking with easy-money policies, bolstered expectations the Fed will reduce its $9 trillion asset portfolio alongside rate increases. Fed officials were nearing agreement on a plan to reduce their bondholdings, the March minutes said.</p><p>\"After Brainard's comments yesterday, the market was bracing for more bad news from the Fed's minutes,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. \"However, it looks like the minutes pretty much were in line with her comments about how the balance-sheet reduction will be implemented. \"</p><p>The prospect of higher rates and a smaller Fed balance sheet has buffeted global markets that had benefited from two years of easy monetary policy by the Fed and other major central banks. Expectations of higher short-term rates have hit the mortgage market, sending the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 4.9% last week, the highest rate since 2018, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p><p>That has rocked shares of home builders, which fell Wednesday across the board, the losses accelerating after the release of the Fed minutes. PulteGroup fell $1.15, or 2.7%, to close at $40.75, Lennar was down $3.42, or 4.3%, to $75.45, and D.R. Horton slid 2.92, or 3.9%, to $71.13. The SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders exchange-traded fund, off 2.3% Wednesday, has lost nearly 30% this year, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"Today is massive de-risking\" as money managers raise cash in a highly uncertain global economy, said Aidan Whitehead, head of equity trading at JMP Securities. \"The uncertainty is driving the volatility, and there's so much of it, particularly when it comes to rates.\"</p><p>He said big investors are largely sitting on the sidelines ahead of earnings season, which will provide indicators about which sectors of the economy are still growing amid a broad slowdown in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Matthew Luzzetti, Deutsche Bank's chief U.S. economist, said in a report Tuesday that aggressive tightening by the Fed \"will push the economy into a recession.\"</p><p>\"It is very clear to everyone [the Fed is] going to engineer a rapid tightening cycle,\" said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier. \"It is possible that the Fed engineers a soft landing, but it would be quite miraculous,\" he added, referring to a situation in which the central bank brings inflation under control without pushing the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>Twitter slipped 0.4%, or $0.21, to close at $50.77. Shares of the social-media company rose this week after filings showed Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had amassed a big stake. Twitter said Tuesday Mr. Musk would join the board. Tesla shares dropped 4.2%, or $45.40, to close at $1045.76. Chip maker Nvidia fell 5.9%, or $15.24, to $244.07.</p><p>Rivian Automotive shares, after rising in early trading after the electric-vehicle maker reported first-quarter production and deliveries that it said were in line with its forecasts, dropped 5%, or $2.09, to $40.10.</p><p>Retailer Walmart closed up $2.52, or 2.3%, to $154.99, a new high and its first record close since November 2020.</p><p>The war in Europe is adding to unease among investors. The Ukraine conflict—and sanctions imposed on Russia by the West—threaten to drive up commodity prices, adding to the inflationary pressures prompting central banks to raise rates. The European Union is taking steps to reduce its energy imports from Russia, but has yet to sanction the purchase of oil and natural gas.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, warned that Russia's invasion \"will have enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond.\" Disruptions in food supplies from the war will affect \"million of people around the world,\" she said.</p><p>In commodities, Brent-crude futures fell $5.57, or 5.2%, to $101.07 a barrel. Brent has fallen in six of the last eight sessions. U.S. allies said they would release close to 60 million additional barrels of oil from their reserves in a continuing bid to tame prices.</p><p>Record Covid-19 cases in China are adding to concerns about global supply chains and growth in China, one of the world's biggest economic engines. Key manufacturing indexes in China recently hit their lowest levels since the February 2020 Covid-19 shock, according to ABN-AMRO Senior Economist Arjen van Dijkhuizen.</p><p>\"With lockdowns in large cities such as Shanghai continuing, we expect these drags to remain visible in April, and perhaps longer,\" he wrote in a Wednesday note. \"The Chinese leadership has repeatedly stressed the need for vigilance on the pandemic front.\"</p><p>Overseas markets retreated. The Stoxx Europe 600 closed down 1.5% under pressure from shares of auto and technology companies, snapping a three-day winning streak. Germany's DAX index, meanwhile, fell 1.9%, its largest one-day percentage decline since early March. The Shanghai Composite Index was flat, Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.9%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com</p><p>Tech Stocks Sink, Bonds Sell Off as Investors Study Fed Minutes</p>",
