  "title": "Nasdaq leads stocks lower in tech rout after Snap's earnings warning; Snap shares plunge more than 41%",
  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped almost 223 points, or 0.7%, to about 31,658.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was down nearly 64 points, or 1.6%, at 3,910.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP slumped almost 337 points, or 2.9%, to around 11,199.</p><p>U.S. stocks finished higher on Monday, with the Dow industrials surging 618.34 points, or 2%, to 31,880.24. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>The U.S. stock market is back on the decline Tuesday, failing to extend Monday's relief rally in a bruising session for technology-related stocks.</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was leading major U.S. stock benchmarks lower Tuesday, adding to big losses so far this year. The Nasdaq is down 28.2% through Monday from its record close of 16,057.44 reached Nov. 19, 2021.</p><p>\"Tech is getting the worst of it\" Tuesday after social-media company Snap Inc. delivered an earnings warning in a slowing economy, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, in a phone interview. Nolte said that he expects the U.S. may fall into a recession in six months to 18 months.</p><p>Opinion: Snap's warning of a weaker outlook sends ripples through tech stocks</p><p>Snap SNAP shares were down more than 41% Tuesday afternoon, following the company's warning late Monday that it would likely miss quarterly estimates as the economy has \"deteriorated further and faster than anticipated.\"</p><p>\"That's stopped all the 'worst is over' pundits in their tracks. It highlights how fleeting swings in sentiment are now and that investors are running at the first sign of trouble,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.</p><p>Other social-media companies that rely on advertising as a revenue stream were also getting battered, with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. FB down more than 9%, Pinterest Inc. PINS tumbling more than 22%, Google parent Alphabet GOOG GOOGL off more than 6% and Twitter Inc. TWTR down 4.5%.</p><p>The technology sector has particularly suffered this year as shares of companies that shot to popularity during the pandemic have retrenched amid a shifting economy. Also extremely sensitive to interest rates, the sector has been unraveling in anticipation of the Federal Reserve raising rates to combat high inflation.</p><p>\"The market continues to turn itself inside out and back to front as it tries to decide if it has priced all of the impending rate hikes, soft landing or recession, inflation or stagflation, China, Ukraine, U.S. summer driving season, supply chains, the list goes on. The result is a day-to-day chopfest, and it seems clear that volatility is the winner,\" said Halley.</p><p>Opinion: 'I feel like I am reliving the summer of 2008.' Strategist David Rosenberg sees bear market sinking the S&amp;P 500 to 3,300</p><p>Meanwhile, sales of new homes in the U.S. slowed in April to an annual rate of 591,000, tumbling 16.6% from 709,000 in March, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast sales to take place at a 750,000 annual rate.</p><p>The drop, which came amid high prices and soaring mortgage rates, marked the fourth straight month of declines in new home sales.</p><p>\"The consumer backdrop is softening,\" said David Page, head of macroeconomic research at AXA Investment Managers, in a phone interview Tuesday. The housing market is \"always one of the first areas to start to soften in the face of rising rates.\"</p><p>See: New home sales plunge as high prices and rising mortgage rates discourage buyers</p><p>In U.S. economic data, businesses expanded at the slowest pace in several months, reflecting the effects of high inflation, ongoing supply shortages and some softening in customer demand, according to the S&amp;P flash U.S. purchasing managers indexes.</p><p>But it isn't all doom and gloom, with some market watchers arguing that last week's retail-led selloff after disappointing results from retailers Walmart Inc. WMT and Target Corp. TGTdidn't necessarily signal the U.S. consumer is in trouble.</p><p>\"We think it is appropriate to spend a minute looking at one thing that continues to go right for the U.S. economy (and which we are hopeful will prove to be a catalyst for a more constructive mood on Wall Street) and that is the consumer, as last week we learned April retail sales were up a robust 0.9% month to month,\" said Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Advisor Solutions, in emailed comments.</p><p>\"Even the extremely disappointing results out of Target —- and other retailers last week —- seem to have had less to do with end consumer demand, and more to do with mix of goods sold and cost inflation,\" he wrote. \"It has become difficult to maintain an optimistic view of things of late; but if the consumer is hanging in there, we think we should too.\"</p><p>Investors may be looking for more policy clues from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who was due to give opening remarks at a Native American development conference at 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Read: Guggenheim's Minerd believes fine art, real estate will outperform stocks, sees bitcoin bottoming at $8,000</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of Dole PLC DOLE fell 10.9% after the food distributor swung to a first-quarter loss and revenue fell short of estimates.</p><p>* Best Buy Co.
