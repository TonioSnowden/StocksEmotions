  "text": "<p>The losses were broad-based, with all 11 of the S&amp;P 500's groups notching declines.</p><p>Stocks have come under pressure from the escalation in tensions between Russia and Western allies over Ukraine. The White House warned that a Russian invasion could be imminent, and diplomatic efforts have so far been inconclusive.

Western officials said Wednesday that Russia was actually continuing its military buildup.</p><p>\"We've got to put more focus on what's being done on the ground, rather than what's being said,\" said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. \"My presumption is that this will be sorted out diplomatically.
