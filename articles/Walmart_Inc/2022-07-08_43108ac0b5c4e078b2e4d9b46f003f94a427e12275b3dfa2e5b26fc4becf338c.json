  "title": "Business News: Levi Strauss Sales Grow 15%; Inventories Rise as Expected",
  "text": "<p>Levi both operates its own stores and sells its products through larger retailers such as Target Corp., Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc.</p><p>Executives have said the company has benefited from growth in denim sales in the U.S., expanding its product line and bringing more premium products to market. Price increases on some products last year and earlier this year haven't damped demand, executives said in April.</p><p>Company leaders said during an earnings call that Levi has also benefited from a more casual dress code as people opt for jeans over slacks in post-pandemic office settings.</p><p>The jeans maker is also attempting to bolster its direct-to-consumer business, with plans to accelerate investments in stores and online platforms.</p><p>Levi's revenue gains come as a range of retailers grapple with excess inventory that could restrain orders from suppliers. Target, a major Levi customer, in June issued a profit warning amid a glut of inventory, which is causing it to cancel orders with vendors and offering large discounts on unwanted items.</p><p>Still, Chief Executive Chip Bergh said Levi's business with Target is \"doing really well\" despite retail headwinds.</p><p>\"We feel really, really good about our position right now in wholesale. We haven't seen any signs of cracks, and I think, again, that speaks to the strength of the Levi's brand,\" Mr. Bergh said during an earnings call.</p><p>Target and Levi have bolstered their partnership recently, with the chain adding the denim wear to an additional 300 stores last spring, up to 800 total stores.</p><p>Inventories are rising across a range of retailers. Factory closures, shipping delays and long production cycles prompted companies to place orders with overseas factories further in advance, making it more difficult to match supply with rapid changes in consumer demand.</p><p>At Levi, inventories rose 29% in the second quarter from a year earlier and 11% from the first quarter. The company said that the growth was in line with expectations and reflected efforts to reduce supply-chain risk and meet consumer demand. Executives said during the earnings call that they are comfortable with on-hand inventory levels.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
