  "title": "Vol. 35, No. 10: Chair",
  "text": "<p>Until now, we had held the line on using chair, except for the piece of furniture; or in quoted matter; or in its traditional use for an academic chair​, such as the chair of the biology department​​ (the ​use in academia is a reference to a teaching throne).​ We also pushed back against using chair as a verb.</p><p>The stylebook will continue to discourage chair as a verb, and not recognize the clunky noun chairperson. ​However, it became increasingly clear that the trend of using chair as a title will only grow, both at companies and organizations including government entities. So we will use the title if that is what the person or organization uses. The Securities and Exchange Commission had called its lead commissioner a chairman from the first one in 1934 through 2021, but lists its current leader, Gary Gensler, as chair.</p><p>Some chairmen and chairwomen are just fine with those titles, thank you, so we don't use chair as a default. As with honorifics (Ms., Mr., Mrs., Dr., etc.), reporters should always ask, if necessary, to get the preferred title right.</p><p>The stylebook now reads:</p><p>CHAIR, CHAIRMAN, CHAIRWOMAN. Any of these terms is acceptable, depending upon which the organization or individual prefers. Avoid chairperson. Capitalize the words as formal titles before names: Chairman Peter Thiel; Peter Thiel, the chairman; Chairwoman Roberta Gardner; Roberta Gardner,​ ​the chairwoman. But: meeting chairman Brodie Martin. ​In corporate contexts, we generally don't need the phrase of the board after the title, unless needed to distinguish from other roles mentioned in the article.​</p><p>We're not British</p><p>W​e love our British friends and readers, but the Journal is written in American English. Or it is supposed to be. Briticisms​ and British spellings still worm their way into our copy.</p><p>S​o, this is another reminder that we should avoid informal British phrases and British spellings in articles. \"Using phrases known elsewhere but not common in the U.S. can lead to misunderstandings among U.S.-based readers about what we are trying to convey​,\" says Neal Lipschutz, a Journal deputy editor in chief. \"Also, we shouldn't often use informal language of any sort in our own voice​,\" he says.</p><p>One recent example was the use of the phrase \"drawing a line under\" in the le​ad paragraph of a​n article as filed. In the U.S., drawing a line (often in the sand) means a boundary that won't be crossed. Some quick online research reveals the former phrase means ending something or considering a bad situation to be over. We also used the phrase \"on the back foot\" in an article about the war in Ukraine. While this phrase is understandable, it is still better to avoid.</p><p>Also recently, we used scheme (as a noun) as a synonym for plan (noun) in a​nother article as filed. \"In the U.S., of course, the word scheme has a significantly more negative connotation than the neutral plan​,\" says ​Neal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Americans don't queue up and aren't sacked by their companies.</p><p>​Causing a 'stir'</p><p>The latest overused word that editors have noticed is stir as a verb, especially in headlines. (Such a nice, short word, for print space!) \"We are stirring concern, usually, ​or outrage​,\" says Enterprise Editor Matthew Rose. \"It's vague and limp and passive and a cop​-out, because it never addresses the underlying news event. And unless it's in a recipe, I think we should stop doing it.​\"</p><p>At the risk of stirring up controversy, we agree with Matthew.</p><p>Missing links?</p><p>We want our journalism to be seen, read and shared. Healthy linking practices in WSJ.com articles make that more possible, notes editing chief Alexandra Kaptik. It is also considered good practice to link to competitors' work when we are crediting them for a scoop.</p><p>But, Lex says, be judicious when linking.</p><p>\"Linking (aka, adding related-content URLs) does a lot more than simply point readers to more information; linking serves to build our authority on the subject,\" says Lex. \"In fact, adding links to digital articles is essential to Google finding and valuing our content. But we can't use any ole links. They need to be URLs that point to quality content, and we need to curate those URLs and match keywords.\"</p><p>If we are citing another publication that broke a story, it is considered good digital hygiene to link to that report on WSJ.com. That information, of course, must be independently corroborated and the publication credited in the article. We should avoid merely repeating others' reporting, and linking to it, simply to fill gaps in our reporting.</p><p>Adding external links in articles means value for the reader, accuracy of the content and endorsement of the site, adds Lex. Even if it's an official site, proceed with caution. Refrain from linking to a site with any kind of fundraising (GoFundMe) or petition or endorsement (Vote for Smith), unless there is approval from the Standards department.</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* We're doing a good job with this, but another reminder: As we plead every year, let's avoid 'Tis the Season headlines or leads unless you really come up with a clever twist.</p><p>* Kanye West or Ye? The musician and designer Kanye West changed his name to Ye. At this point, he is much more recognized as Kanye West, so Journal articles are using that name, and Mr. West on second reference. But we include a phrase near the top of the article that notes his new name. For example: Mr. West, who goes by Ye, says…. Or: Mr. West, who has changed his legal name to Ye, says….</p><p>* We lowercase religious in religious Zionism and religious Zionists when referring to the movement and its followers, but uppercase when referring to the name of the political party, Religious Zionism.</p><p>* Stock action: Remember to include stock movements in articles about companies where the stock's fate is relevant. And for broad stock-market movements, we still want to include the familiar Dow Jones Industrial Average, not just the S&amp;P 500, despite the latter's being a broader index.</p><p>* Companies seem to be \"pausing\" a lot lately, as in \"pausing hiring\" or \"pausing spending.\" It has become a euphemism for stopping, often for an undetermined time. And in any case, let's not use the redundant \"temporarily pause.\"</p><p>* We don't use exclamation points in company names (Yahoo not Yahoo!), but we should be careful to include them if that is how a musical title is spelled. So: \"Oklahoma!\" and \"Hello, Dolly!\"</p><p>* Decadelong is one word, along with yearlong, monthlong, daylong and their plurals, such as decadeslong.</p><p>Progressive/liberal</p><p>A reminder that we shouldn't consider liberal and progressive as synonyms, as some writers do. If appropriate, we do refer to people as being conservative or liberal, but the progressive label is usually nothing more than political spin. After all, as Style &amp; Substance has asked before, who doesn't like to be considered progressive? In any case, it is best to describe an individual's specific views rather than to affix a broad label.</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"The $300 Million Sneaker King Comes Undone,\" by Sam Enriquez and Matthew Rose.</p><p>* \"Hershey's Turnaround Story Isn't Sweet. It's Salty,\" by Erik Holm, Ben Cohen and Ethan Smith.</p><p>* \"The Most Honorable Character in Twitter v. Elon Musk,\" with deck: \"The Delaware Court of Chancery is no place for theatrics, and the judge presiding over the case has kept things on track,\" by Ben Cohen and Ethan Smith.</p><p>* \"There's a New Menace Stalking Suburbia. Meet the McBasement,\" by Matthew Rose.</p><p>* \"Orders for Cocaine, Deaths by Fentanyl,\" by Beth Blackshire.</p><p>Notifications above the rest</p><p>Here are some of the top mobile push alerts, both on WSJ's native app and via Apple News. Our aim is to highlight the storytelling our editors do on locked screens, typically in 140 characters or fewer.</p><p>* The company that lost $800 billion</p><p>* The airplane of the future is coming—and it looks seriously weird</p><p>* \"Are we going to the salon tonight?\" She answered the text, and it cost her $1.6 million.</p><p>* On the same day, three New Yorkers—a trader, a lawyer and a social worker—ordered cocaine from a delivery service. Within hours, all three were dead.</p><p>* Help wanted. This job pays $103,000—or maybe $206,000.</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* In Pennsylvania, more than 685,000 ballots had been cast through the mail as of Wednesday. That is four times more than the roughly 167,000 that were cast in 2018 before the state law changes.</p><p>* The country's newly inaugurated president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was open to Huawei building 5G networks in his country.</p><p>* Scott Yates, an entrepreneur from Denver, has been campaigning to fix the time in the U.S. since his wife got tired of him whining about the semiannual clock changes.</p><p>* Republicans spent about $30 million and Democrats another $19 million in that race.</p><p>* Under the terms of the deal, Walmart agreed to pay between $2 to $3 per subscriber per month for Paramount's ad-supported plan.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* The \"times more\" math error again: 685,000 is about four times as much as or equivalently, three times more than 167,000.</p><p>* He was open to Huawei's building 5G networks. Huawei, the subject of a gerund (building), takes possessive form.</p><p>* Again, the gerund requires the possessive: his whining.</p><p>* As the stylebook says, another means the same amount. Often, an additional is the phrase that is called for. In this case, the word isn't needed at all.​</p><p>* Between calls for an and. So we meant $2 and $3.</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.</p><p>ISSN 1054-7041</p><p>Vol. 35, No. 10: Chair</p>",
