  "title": "Veteran-Focused Black Rifle Coffee Going Public Through $1.7 Billion SPAC Deal; Coffee seller focused on military veterans is going public by combining with SPAC SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp. I.",
  "text": "<p>Black Rifle Coffee Co. is going public by combining with a special-purpose acquisition company in a merger that values the coffee seller focused on military veterans at about $1.7 billion, the companies said.</p><p>Known for its pricier coffee and firearms-themed products such as its AK-47 Espresso Blend, Black Rifle is combining with the SPAC SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp. I.</p><p>Black Rifle also sells branded apparel and produces digital content to promote its products to veterans and first responders.</p><p>Founded by former Green Beret Evan Hafer in 2014, Black Rifle has capitalized on consumers' desire to shop at brands that support social causes. Mr. Hafer vowed in 2017 to hire 10,000 veterans after Starbucks Corp. promised to hire 10,000 refugees following then President Donald Trump's executive order barring more refugees from entering the country.</p><p>Today, about half of Black Rifle's roughly 600 employees are military veterans, a total that Mr. Hafer said in an interview he expects to grow after the SPAC deal.</p><p>\"This just reaffirms my commitment to that promise,\" he said.</p><p>Salt Lake City-based Black Rifle expects sales this year to grow about 40% to roughly $230 million. Most of the company's revenue comes from online sales. It also has seven physical stores across the country and sells through large outlets such as Walmart Inc. </p><p>Former Green Beret Evan Hafer founded Black Rifle in 2014. He has said he hopes to keep the company focused on veterans' issues rather than a certain political party.

Many startups have become PBCs, with investors increasingly giving priority to companies' missions.</p><p>\"We want to do well for ourselves and do good for our community,\" Joe Reece, the SPAC's executive chairman, said.</p><p>Shares of the SPAC rose 15% to $11.31 on Tuesday after the deal was announced.</p><p>Black Rifle is raising $100 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the deal. The hedge fund Engaged Capital—one of the firms that backs the SilverBox Engaged SPAC—is also putting in $100 million.</p><p>Black Rifle and the SPAC have also raised additional funds in case SPAC investors withdraw money before the deal closes. Such withdrawals tend to occur when a SPAC's shares trade below its listing price and have surged lately, making it harder to complete deals. The SilverBox SPAC currently has $345 million.</p><p>Some of the cash from the deal will be used to pay down Black Rifle's debt and cover transaction costs.</p><p>Also called a blank-check firm, a SPAC raises money, then lists on a stock exchange with the sole intention of combining with a private firm like Black Rifle to take it public. After a deal is announced, the company releases detailed financial statements. Regulators review its information, then approve the deal. After it closes, the private company replaces the SPAC in the stock market.</p><p>Such deals have emerged as common alternatives to traditional initial public offerings for startups in the past few years, in part because companies merging with SPACs can make business projections that wouldn't be allowed in IPOs.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you invest in the Black Rifle Coffee SPAC deal? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Investor excitement has returned to SPACs and the companies they take public after shares of the SPAC that is taking Mr. Trump's new social-media venture public recently skyrocketed.</p><p>SilverBox Engaged is backed by Engaged and several other investment firms: private-equity firm Boxwood Capital, merchant bank Helena Capital and debt investor Silver Rock Financial.</p><p>The SPAC team and Black Rifle executives and investors have agreed to forfeit some of their shares if the stock doesn't hit certain thresholds. Such steps are intended to ease concerns about SPAC deals disproportionately enriching insiders—who typically get cheap shares—at the expense of other investors.</p><p>Both companies are also donating some shares to the BRCC Fund, Black Rifle's veteran-focused charity.</p><p>Black Rifle has made political headlines in recent years, but Mr. Hafer said he hopes to keep the company focused on veterans and unaffiliated with a political party.</p><p>Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who is on trial for killing two people and wounding another during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wis., was photographed wearing a Black Rifle Coffee T-shirt when he was released on bond late last year.</p><p>Mr. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty. A photo from the U.S. Capitol riot in January then captured a man wearing tactical gear and a Black Rifle Coffee hat jumping over a railing with a handful of plastic handcuffs.</p><p>Mr. Hafer said the company has likely lost some customers after trying to distance Black Rifle from such incidents. The incidents let him clarify the firm's veterans-focused mission, he said.</p><p>The company will be renamed BRC Inc. after the deal closes.</p><p>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>Veteran-Focused Black Rifle Coffee Going Public Through $1.7 Billion SPAC Deal</p>",
