  "text": "<p>Roughly 727,000 fewer students enrolled in undergraduate programs this past spring compared with the same time last year, according to the National Student Clearinghouse, which collects student data from around the country. The year-over-year declines were nearly as steep in the fall term.</p><p>Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the share of new high-school graduates who enrolled in college last fall was the lowest it has been in 20 years, just shy of 63%. And many others who started school in the fall quickly withdrew, say college officials.</p><p>\"The stakes are huge,\" said Lee Gray, senior director of education and advocacy at the Oasis Center, a Nashville-based nonprofit with a range of youth services. \"If we don't do our jobs to the point of exhaustion, just to have a conversation about where they're at and where they want to go, and is education still a part of their plan, it's going to be a huge failure.\"</p><p>Even in a normal year, students can disappear from the pipeline, a phenomenon known as summer melt. Sometimes they get off a waiting list at another school. More often, they miss a deadline and panic, or just settle into the workforce.</p><p>About 1,750 Metro Nashville Public Schools seniors who filled out state or federal financial-aid applications didn't actually enroll last fall -- a melt rate of 42% and about 1,000 more lost students than in the prior year, according to the Tennessee College Access and Success Network.</p><p>The college-going rate in the city fell to the lowest level in more than a decade. And those already in college dropped out in droves, with 59% of first-year students staying on for their second year, down from 75%.</p><p>The first step in connecting with the former students is identifying whom to target. New requests for the National Student Clearinghouse's Student Tracker, which lets high schools see college enrollment details for their graduates going back eight years, are up 50% this spring. They can track whether former students enrolled, where they transferred, and if they graduated or dropped out.</p><p>The Oasis Center is pulling data for students from its 11 partner high schools and, now that it has wrapped up most of its work with the 2021 senior class, chasing down those from 2020.</p><p>In Massachusetts, Springfield Public Schools officials have been comparing Clearinghouse records to senior surveys about postgraduation plans. Some enrolled as anticipated at schools such as Holyoke Community College and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Others aren't registered there, or anywhere.</p><p>Yolanda Johnson, Springfield's executive officer for student services, recalls thinking, \"Oh my gosh, it's all falling apart,\" as national figures on college enrollments were reported.</p><p>In Springfield, 37% of 2020's graduates enrolled in college, down from 45% in 2019.</p><p>Angel Miguel Font Hernandez graduated from Springfield's Roger L. Putnam Vocational Technical Academy in the spring of 2020, but disliked online courses so much that he decided against starting college right away. Instead, he kept working part time at Wendy's, eventually shifting to a full-time job at Walmart. Most of his friends took jobs rather than enroll in school, too, he said.</p><p>Earlier this month Mr. Hernandez reached out to his former Putnam counselor for help filling out a financial-aid application and paperwork for Springfield Technical Community College. He wants to go into law enforcement, he thinks, or maybe teaching. Now he is nudging friends, with a simple refrain: \"Bro, we gotta go to college.\"</p>",
