  "text": "<p>Struggling US department store operator Kohl's is in dire need of a new look, reckons <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/kohls-investor-engine-capital-idCNL4N2SR2N6\">Engine Capital</a>. The New York-based hedge fund is pushing the retailer, in which it holds 1 per cent, towards a sale or spin-off of its ecommerce division to revive its lagging stock price.</p> <p>Engine argues that Kohl's online business, assuming it generates $6.2bn in annual revenue, could be worth $12.4bn alone. That is substantially more than the company's current $7.7bn market value. </p> <p>For sure, Kohl's could use a refresh. Even before the pandemic, the retailer was struggling with stagnant sales growth and falling profits. Shares are pretty much where they were a decade ago. At just 7 times forward earnings, the stock has one of the lowest valuations in the retail sector. Big box retailers like Target and Walmart command multiples that are almost three times higher. </p> <p>Yet Kohl should resist Engine's proposals. Their ideas may be compelling but, like clothes that look good in the fitting room, these are flawed in the brutal light of reality. Spinning off the ecommerce unit would reduce, or even eliminate, the benefits of omnichannel retail.</p> <p>Companies most successful in surviving the so-called retail apocalypse are those that use their physical stores to fulfil online orders within local markets. Whether by creating micro-distribution centres in back rooms or using stores for kerbside and in-store pick-up services, this omnichannel approach keeps shipping costs down and helps drive foot traffic to physical stores. Engine says the two entities could contract to keep the omnichannel experience for the customer seamless. But in practice this would be complicated and messy.</p> <p>The call for an outright sale also seems oddly timed. Kohl's shares have already rallied by a third this year and management is proactively taking steps to overhaul the business. These include becoming a drop-off point for Amazon returns and opening Sephora shops inside its department stores to attract younger shoppers. Management deserves more time to show investors it can turn the company around.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Kohl's: activist wants retailer to try on new look' FT.com 6 December.
