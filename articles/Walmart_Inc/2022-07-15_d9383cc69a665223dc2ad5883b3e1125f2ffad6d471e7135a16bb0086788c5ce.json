Executives discussed reducing its private-label assortment in the U.S. by well over half, one of them said.</p><p>The move was initiated after a review of the business by Dave Clark, a longtime Amazon executive who took over as head of its global consumer business in January 2021, the people said. Clark left the company last month. As a result of that review, Clark pushed the team to focus on bestselling commodity goods, along the lines of Target Corp.'s TGT \"Up &amp; Up\" or Walmart Inc.'s WMT \"Great Value\" brands, rather than offer the extensive range of items Amazon currently does, the people said.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>12 hours of misery at Heathrow: Huge crowds, lost bags, endless cancellations.</p><p>People have money but feel glum â€” what does that mean for the economy?</p><p>Amazon slashes its private-label selection, considers exiting business under regulatory pressure</p>",
