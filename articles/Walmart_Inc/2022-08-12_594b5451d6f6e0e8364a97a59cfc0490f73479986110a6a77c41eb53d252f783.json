  "text": "<p>Savings from those actions will amount to between $8 million and $9 million this year, and about $15 million to $17 million next year, the company said. It reiterated plans to open 40 stores this year, which would bring its total to 201.</p><p>Warby Parker is one of several brands that launched as online disrupters and are turning to bricks-and-mortar selling in search of profits. Since its initial pitch of eyeglasses starting at $95, the company has expanded into offering eye exams and contact lenses.</p><p>In March, the company said sales growth would be lower for the year compared with 2021, but attributed lower demand to the disruption caused by the Omicron variant of Covid-19 earlier in the year. Now, executives say, inflation is a drag on consumer spending, and the company is unsure when this period of higher prices will end.</p><p>\"We're really being conservative in our assumptions,\" Dave Gilboa, Warby Parker co-founder and co-chief executive, told analysts during a conference call, adding that customers are making fewer discretionary purchases. \"We're not counting on that pent-up demand to show up in our forecast.\"</p><p>Warby Parker said it now expects net revenue between $584 million and $595 million for the year, compared with its prior forecast of $650 million to $660 million. The latest forecast implies year-over-year revenue growth between 8% and 10%, instead of between 20% and 22%.</p><p>Shares of Warby Parker were up roughly 19% for the day, closing at $16.90.</p><p>The company's stock is down about 64% so far this year, compared with a 12% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Investors bidding up the shares on Thursday were more focused on the long-term growth outlook of the company more than the aggressive reduction in targets in the short-term, said Ed Yruma, an analyst for Piper Sandler. \"They're less than 1% of the optical market, they have attractive price points, they could easily triple the store count over time,\" he said.</p><p>Warby Parker became the latest retailer to lower its guidance, following companies including Walmart Inc. and sneaker maker Allbirds Inc., as higher prices cause consumers to pull back on spending.</p><p>In the latest quarter, Warby Parker posted revenue of $149.6 million, up 14% from the previous year. Its net loss widened to $32.2 million, or 28 cents a share, as the company said it reported higher expenses including those tied to stock-based compensation. On an adjusted basis, the loss was a penny a share, which narrowly beat analysts' forecasts.</p><p>The company said its gross margin fell from the prior year, attributing the decline to its growing contact lens business.</p><p>Average revenue per customer increased 8.2% during the quarter to $254.</p>",
