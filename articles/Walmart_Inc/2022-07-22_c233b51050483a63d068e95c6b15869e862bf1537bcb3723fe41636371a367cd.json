  "title": "Amazon Public Policy Executive Jay Carney Leaving Tech Giant for Airbnb; Move is the latest in a string of senior-ranking Amazon employees to defect from the company",
  "text": "<p>The home-sharing company said Mr. Carney will start at Airbnb in September and will report to co-founder and Chief Executive Brian Chesky. Mr. Chesky said Mr. Carney is the \"perfect person to lead policy and communications at Airbnb,\" citing his work in government, technology and his time as a journalist.</p><p>Amazon in 2015 hired Mr. Carney, a former longtime Time magazine reporter who had joined the Obama administration on the vice president's staff before becoming White House press secretary. Amazon realized it was late to government relations, and its ever-growing empire was coming under pressure from regulators at the time of his hiring.</p><p>While Mr. Carney has close ties to those in the current White House administration, his power at the White House was neutered during his tenure at Amazon. Mr. Biden, Mr. Carney's former boss, has often publicly criticized Amazon, and Amazon was often shunned at prominent White House events where CEOs were hosted.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Carney directed a frustrated message at Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, after Mr. Biden hosted the CEOs of Walmart Inc., Gap Inc., Lowe's Cos. and JPMorgan Chase Co., said people familiar with the exchange. Amazon wasn't invited, and Mr. Carney pleaded for Amazon to be considered for future events, the people said. In December, Mr. Carney messaged Mr. Klain questioning him about a Politico article stating that Mr. Biden was embracing Amazon rival Walmart, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>While Mr. Carney became a close consigliere of Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, who also espoused an aggressive stance with regulators and lawmakers, he hasn't had the same rapport with current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Jassy has been more inclined to court lawmakers on the Hill and make Amazon's case more diplomatically, said people who have attended meetings with him.</p><p>At Amazon's D.C. offices, many employees had grown frustrated with Amazon's—and Mr. Carney's—approach to public-policy, The Journal has reported. A series of nasty tweets aimed at lawmakers that were written by Mr. Carney, Mr. Bezos and other senior Amazon executives infuriated many on the public policy team, The Journal has reported.</p><p>In an email this morning to his senior leaders, Mr. Jassy said: \"Since joining the company in 2015, Jay has scaled and led the Public Policy and Public Relations teams across all of our businesses and geographies with the overarching goal of ensuring that policy makers, reporters and customers are all accurately informed about Amazon's contributions to economic growth, job creation, innovation and sustainability—as well as our unmatched focus on customers.\"</p><p>Amazon is conducting a search for Mr. Carney's replacement, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Denny Jacob contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon Public Policy Executive Jay Carney Leaving Tech Giant for Airbnb</p>",
