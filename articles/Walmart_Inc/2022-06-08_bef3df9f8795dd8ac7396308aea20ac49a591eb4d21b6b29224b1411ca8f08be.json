  "title": "Target Signals  High Inventory  Will Hit Profit  ---  Retailer plans to use  discounts to unload its  surplus of goods as  shopper demand shifts  ----  By Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>    Target Corp. warned its profit would drop because it needs to cancel orders with vendors and offer discounts to clear out unwanted goods, the latest sign of the sudden mismatch between supply and demand inside U.S. stores. </p><p>   Big retailers benefited over the past two years from the pandemic rush to buy patio furniture, laptops and home decor, as shoppers were buoyed by savings and government stimulus checks. Now many of those same stores are grappling with a swift reversal of buying behavior, with consumers spending less on goods in favor of services and necessities such as food and fuel. </p><p>   Less than three weeks after reporting a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, Target said Tuesday it has further tempered its profit outlook for the year. Inventory rose 43% in the April quarter as demand for outdoor furniture, small appliances and some electronics declined faster than expected and supply-chain snarls delayed the arrival of many goods past the ideal selling window, Target previously said. The company is moving faster to unload excess inventory in the current quarter. \"We've had some additional time after earnings to really evaluate the overall operating environment,\" Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. That includes watching consumers' behavior as they face high rates of inflation, he said, and seeing many other retailers talk about high inventory levels during their earnings presentations. \"We have to be decisive and get out in front of this to make sure this doesn't linger through the back half of the year,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Cornell said he wanted to share the new profit estimates ahead of Target's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday. Target's stock opened down more than 7% Tuesday but the decline moderated and it closed down 2.3% to $155.98. The shares are down 33% for the year, compared with a roughly 13% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Shares of other big retailers including Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. also closed lower, in contrast with gains in major U.S. stock indexes. </p><p>   \"Coming so soon after its downbeat quarterly results, today's update from Target comes across as somewhat careless,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. The update could signal that demand for some categories, such as home goods -- an area where Target sells a variety of products -- has deteriorated further, Mr. Saunders said. </p><p>   The warning also underscores the growing challenge of forecasting demand as spending shifts to entertainment, inflation squeezes shoppers, and supply-chain snarls ease. Order books for many retailers are developed nearly a year in advance, meaning that they are projecting sales for goods and fashion trends well before consumers typically would be ready to buy them. </p><p>   Many retailers said they have too much inventory on hand when they reported earnings in recent weeks, including Walmart, Macy's Inc. and Gap Inc. Some are discounting goods, as well as holding on to some items to sell at the seasonally appropriate moment, retail executives have said. </p><p>   They pointed to rapidly changing shopper preferences, as well as unpredictable import shipping schedules, as some of the reasons for an oversupply. </p><p>   Dealing with the excess inventory as quickly as possible could benefit Target if it is able to restock its shelves with more in-demand goods later in the year while competitors are still working through excess items, a Target spokeswoman said. </p><p>   Target said it aims to cancel orders with suppliers when possible or use promotions to remove all excess inventory during the current quarter. Mr. Cornell wants to restock stores with products in high demand such as food, beauty products and back-to-school items, he said. </p><p>   Target now expects its second-quarter operating margin rate will be in a range around 2%, down from its late-May estimate of around 5.3%. For the full year, the company expects to be slightly below earlier forecasts because of the moves it is making in the second quarter, Mr. Cornell said. In May, Target said it expected full-year operating margin to fall in a range around 6%. The company continues to expect full-year revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digit percent range. </p><p>   Target's lower profit estimates are the latest sign that many retailers are struggling to navigate a rapidly changing environment. Sales are growing at many retailers, but profits have suffered as costs rise amid inflation and consumers spend more of their disposable income on experiences such as travel, entertainment and dining out. </p><p>   Walmart posted lower-than-expected profit when it reported earnings last month, in part because of labor costs that were higher than it anticipated and spending shifts. Walmart, the country's largest retailer by revenue, also reported inventory was up around 33% in the most recent quarter. The rise reflected buying behavior, the higher costs of goods because of inflation and a sudden uptick in goods moving through U.S. ports after Walmart earlier bought products aggressively to meet demand. </p><p>   At Walmart's annual shareholder meeting last week, executives said around 20% of the elevated inventory consists of items the company wishes it didn't have, but much of the rest is to restock shelves or sell later this year. \"It's going to take this quarter and probably part of next, maybe a couple of quarters would be the best way to describe it, to get back to where we want to be,\" said John Furner, head of Walmart U.S. </p><p>   Macy's net sales jumped 13.6% in the spring quarter compared with a year before. But the company said markdowns to clear the excess inventory would weigh on profit margins going forward and warned of higher promotional levels throughout the industry as other retailers do the same. Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in an interview in late May that the shift away from casual clothes to more dressy attire was significant and happened faster than the company had anticipated. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
