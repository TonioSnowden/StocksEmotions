  "title": "U.S. News: Walmart, Disney Require Shots for Certain Workers --- Moves come as federal health guidelines shift and cases in the U.S. continue to increase",
  "text": "<p>Disney said Friday its vaccine requirement applies to salaried and nonunion workers, while Walmart said its vaccine mandate applied to corporate staff and regional managers.</p><p>\"As we all know, the pandemic is not over, and the Delta variant has led to an increase in infection rates across much of the U.S.,\" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon wrote in a memo announcing the requirement.</p><p>Walmart isn't requiring all of its 1.6 million U.S. workers to get Covid-19 shots. The mandate, unveiled in a staff memo Friday, doesn't apply to its store and warehouse staffers, the bulk of its workforce. Instead it is encouraging those employees to get vaccinated by offering a $150 bonus.</p><p>Disney said it would require salaried and nonunion employees in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated within 60 days, and that it had begun conversations with its labor unions. In addition, all new hires would be required to be fully vaccinated before starting. Disney had about 170,000 employees world-wide as of April 3, according to a securities filing.</p><p>Both companies have also adopted new mask rules for customers this week. Disney said it would require visitors to wear masks indoors at its U.S. theme parks, while Walmart is asking shoppers to wear masks inside stores in U.S. counties deemed at high risk of viral transmission.</p><p>Walmart said it would implement a system to verify which of its U.S. workers are vaccinated. Previously, Walmart and many employers used the honor system to identify which workers aren't vaccinated and should be masked. Corporate staff and regional managers will need to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 4.</p><p>Major U.S. businesses are adjusting to new federal health guidance and rising U.S. Covid cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that vaccinated people resume wearing masks in some indoor spaces, reversing its earlier guidance. On Friday, the CDC said vaccinated people may spread the Delta variant.</p><p>Earlier this week, Google and Facebook Inc. said they would require workers returning to offices to get vaccinated. Rival Amazon.com Inc. said it wouldn't mandate workers to get vaccinated.</p><p>Companies including Uber Technologies Inc. and Twitter Inc. announced delays to plans to return to their corporate offices. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc., instructed staff to wear masks at offices, regardless of vaccination status.</p><p>In a separate memo Friday to staff, Walmart said it would encourage, but not require, shoppers to wear masks inside its stores. In counties with \"substantial\" or \"high\" transmission rates as defined by the CDC, new signage in stores will ask all customers to wear masks, said a company spokesman. In other areas, it will keep current signage that asks non-vaccinated shoppers to wear masks.</p><p>---</p><p>Maria Armental contributed to this article.</p>",
