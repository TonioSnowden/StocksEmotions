  "title": "Kohl's First-Quarter Sales Fall as Retailers Struggle With Inflation; Department-store chain posts a wide earnings miss as it awaits buyout bids",
  "text": "<p>While sales were up in March from a year ago, Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass said that the top line fell in April as inflation spurred consumers to tighten their belts. She said the year has started off below the company's expectation and cut its full-year guidance.</p><p>Shares, down about 12.6% so far this year, fell more than 6% in premarket trading.</p><p>The results are the latest warning sign this week on the retail environment, which has sparked a major selloff of shares across the sector.</p><p>Large retailers from Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. are increasing sales at rates far slower than they did during the height of the pandemic, and now profits are falling on higher costs. Shoppers are also switching from discretionary purchases to lower-margin items like groceries and other household staples, pressuring profits.</p><p>Big home-improvement chains Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. are seeing transaction counts fall, but revenue is being supported by higher pricesfor items across their stores.</p><p>Kohl's also provided an update on its sales process, saying it expects bids to come in for the chain in the coming weeks. It has alreadyfielded offers from bidders including the private-equity firm Sycamore Partners and Canada's Hudson's Bay Co.</p><p>As that plays out, some executives are leaving the company. In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, Kohl's said that its chief merchandising officer, Doug Howe, is leaving the company, and that Chief Marketing Officer Greg Revelle will be stepping down in June.</p><p>The sales process came after Kohl's rejected a $9 billion takeover offer from a group of activist investors in February for being too low and adopted a poison pill to prevent them from buying up more than 10% of the company.</p><p>It recently won a proxy battle, as shareholders backed Kohl's slate of directors over an activist's push to replace up to 10 of the 13 board members.</p><p>For the quarter ended April 30, Kohl's reported earnings of $14 million, flat from the prior year. Per-share earnings came in at 11 cents. Analysts had been expecting 69 cents a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Total revenue was $3.5 billion, below analyst estimates for $3.7 billion.</p><p>The company is now expecting no more than 1% growth in net sales for the year, after previously forecasting that its full-year top line would rise between 2% and 3%. It also expects annual earnings to be between $6.45 and $6.85 a share, marking a 60 cent per-share reduction from the midpoint of its previous guidance.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Kohl's First-Quarter Sales Fall as Retailers Struggle With Inflation</p>",
