  "text": "<p>Beyond helping the environment, better recycling systems are \"a huge business opportunity,\" Mr. Gonen says over the phone from his office in Manhattan, not far from the home he shares with his wife and two young children. \"CEOs are recognizing that gaining access to high-quality recycled content will enable them to manufacture for a lot less money and with a lot less volatility,\" he explains.</p><p>Mr. Gonen believes that idealistic younger shoppers and the pressure of social media have changed the equation for big consumer-goods companies: \"CEOs have to deal with the fact that they can't hide practices that might be upsetting to consumers anymore.\" A recent global survey from the IBM Institute for Business Value found that half of consumers said they paid an average of 59% more for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible in the past year.</p><p>Businesses, Mr. Gonen says, are increasingly leading the way in innovating greener methods for making and recycling products. Closed Loop develops and leads industry consortiums to create such products, working with Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Starbucks to design thermal cups and packaging that is easier to recycle and reuse, and with CVS Health, Kroger, Target and Walmart to design the best replacement for the single-use plastic bag.</p><p>Mr. Gonen was five years old when he moved from Israel to the U.S. with his mother and sister after his parents divorced. He attended what he calls \"one of the worst public schools in Philadelphia in the 1980s, when the city was a very rough place.\" Although he was taught that America is a meritocracy that rewards hard work, he recalls gazing around his shabby school in 4th grade and thinking, \"No one's going to make it out of here.\"</p><p>Mr. Gonen's single mother, a schoolteacher, struggled to provide for her children, but she managed to get her kids into a better public school in the suburbs and shepherded her son to his many swim team practices and meets. His skills in the water earned him a scholarship to swim and play water polo at a top suburban private school, which meant waking at 5 a.m. to be in the water by 6:30 a.m. three days a week. \"I developed the discipline to make the most of an opportunity,\" he says.</p><p>To earn money, Mr. Gonen babysat and did odd jobs for his water polo coach, who was starting to design sustainable homes as an architect. Mr. Gonen learned from him about passive design, arranging windows and spaces to maximize natural sources of heat and shade. \"I looked around and noticed that most homes were built inefficiently,\" he says. \"They just use a lot of oil and gas to cover it up.\"</p><p>Mr. Gonen says he arrived at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst eager to one day build a business that solved some of the social and environmental problems he kept noticing around him. To that end, he studied history and economics: \"If you want to change systems, you need to put in the effort to understand how they're built.\"</p><p>After graduating in 1997, Mr. Gonen spent a few years in management consulting, first at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), then at Deloitte. The jobs felt wide of his passions, but the tech boom was a fine time to learn how to code and figure out how businesses work. To strengthen this grasp, Mr. Gonen pursued an M.B.A. at Columbia; the university became a seed investor for his first business, RecycleBank, which he created with a friend while he was still a student in 2003. \"They put in the first $100,000 and exited a few years later with over $1 million, which is a pretty good return,\" he says.</p><p>RecycleBank uses software and coupons at major retailers to reward households for what they recycle. During Mr. Gonen's tenure as CEO from 2003 to 2010, the company spread to 50 cities and claimed to have diverted millions of pounds of material from landfills, earning plaudits from the World Economic Forum and the United Nations. Yet he and his investors had conflicting visions for the company, so he left. \"I learned a valuable lesson about why it's so important to have mission-aligned investors,\" he says.</p><p>Mr. Gonen was still pondering next steps when Mayor Michael Bloomberg tapped him in 2012 to manage New York City's recycling programs as the Deputy Commissioner for Sanitation, Recycling and Sustainability. In his two years grappling with the country's largest solid-waste management system, Mr. Gonen introduced programs to recycle electronics, apparel and organic waste, and helped pass legislation banning Styrofoam in the city. He says that Mr. Bloomberg's personal imperviousness to financial pressures gave him a latitude he likely wouldn't have had elsewhere. \"In most other administrations, I would've been shut down by special interests,\" he says. \"My experience in government was great and very unique.\"</p><p>When Mr. Gonen launched Closed Loop in 2014, it was mainly to help update and expand recycling systems around the country. He notes that the upfront cost for top-notch recycling infrastructure is daunting, but the investment can pay off by reducing landfill costs and increasing the quality of the bales of paper, metal and plastic to be sold and reused. New York City, for example, paid over $450 million to export and landfill its waste, much of it recyclable, in 2021. Closed Loop estimates its investments have kept nearly 4 million tons of materials in circulation and nearly 7 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions out of the atmosphere.</p><p>Although Mr. Gonen is happy to make the business case for a circular economy, he recommends public policy changes, too. He suggests it's a problem that there are no incentives for Americans to waste less and recycle more, and he would like to see corporations charged for unrecyclable products and packaging that ends up in landfills. Rather than have waste be \"treated as a cost of the commons,\" born by the thrifty and the profligate alike, he generally recommends more sticks and carrots to encourage better behavior.</p><p>\"I'm a big believer in motivating consumers and companies through self-interest,\" Mr. Gonen explains. \"Ultimately it boils down to who pays? Who pays to send all of this stuff to landfills?\"</p><p>Investor Ron Gonen Thinks a Greener Economy Depends on Businesses</p>",
