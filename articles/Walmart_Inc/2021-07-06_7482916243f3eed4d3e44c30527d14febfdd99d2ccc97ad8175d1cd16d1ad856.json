  "text": "<p>Ministers will request a meeting with executives at UK supermarket chain Wm Morrison over a pending £9.5bn takeover by a group of private equity firms, seeking reassurances over jobs and investment.</p> <p>On Saturday morning, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd0219a-6acb-4e17-be9f-69c54c85e330\">Morrisons recommended the bid</a> led by SoftBank-owned Fortress, which offered 252p a share and a 2p special dividend, alongside a long list of commitments to safeguard the company's employees, suppliers and pension holders.</p> <p>The deal has drawn political attention as part of a wave of private equity takeovers of UK businesses since the start of the year.</p> <p>Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary, is expected to ask for a meeting with Morrisons chair Andrew Higginson in coming weeks, according to people familiar with the situation, seeking reassurances over jobs, pensions and the chain's UK operations.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, Kwarteng declined to comment on the meeting request, but added that he was “monitoring the situation”.</p> <p>He said: “Morrisons is a historic brand name and [I am] very interested in seeing how the situation develops. We need to assess what's going on before making rush judgments. You have to look at behaviour, specifics and track record and see that certain safeguards are kept.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Kwarteng added that private equity buying UK businesses “was not in itself a bad thing”, and that “global Britain” would thrive on foreign investment.</p> <p>Seema Malhotra, shadow business minister, urged the government to scrutinise the deal and ensure the buyers made commitments to protect the workforce, pension scheme and the supply chain.</p> <p>“The government's indifferent approach to takeovers means British businesses are far too often bought by companies with short-term aims and without the interests of the British economy, businesses, workers and customers in mind,” she said.</p> <p>Morrisons accepted the Fortress-led offer after last month rejecting a 230p a share bid from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da5c8b25-3535-41d6-80c4-944340d17e42\">Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</a>. Apollo, which lost out last year in a bidding battle for Asda, another UK supermarket chain, said on Monday that it was “in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer”.</p> <p>Fortress has written to the government offering reassurances over its intentions for the company. The letter, which has been seen by the FT, said that Fortress is “acutely aware of the wider responsibilities that come with ownership of a business with Morrisons' history, culture and importance to the British public”.</p> <p>The letter was signed by Joshua Pack, co-chief investment officer of credit funds at Fortress, on behalf of the firm. Pack said that “I want to reassure you that we fully intend to be a supportive and responsible owner of Morrisons, should we complete the transaction successfully.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Commitments that the groups have made about the future of Morrisons, which traces its roots back to a market stall opened in 1899, include keeping the company's headquarters in West Yorkshire, safeguarding pensions and maintaining a £10-an-hour minimum pay deal for staff.</p> <p>“We are committed to being a good steward of Morrisons through the next stage of its evolution.”</p> <p>Mark Kelly, managing director at investment bank Cowen, said in a note on Monday that the “only risk worthy of any level of discussion would be the scope for the UK secretary of state for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy to intervene”.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>But he added that Fortress had gone to great lengths to address this. “There is indeed a very low risk of the UK government intervening.”</p> <p>On Monday, the UK's largest asset manager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d1a6019-6571-478c-8b1f-f267bb582f0d\">Legal &amp; General Investment Management</a> warned that private equity firms must not be allowed to acquire Morrisons for the “wrong reasons”, such as profiting from the supermarket chain's property portfolio or “levering the company up with debt”.</p> <p>The union Usdaw also expressed concern about the deal and said they were seeking “urgent” meetings with management and the potential new owners to ensure “the long-term future of the business are protected throughout this process”.</p> <p>Morrisons declined to comment.</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas, Peter Campbell, Patricia Nilsson and Jim Pickard 2021 'UK ministers to seek assurances over Morrisons takeover' FT.com 6 July.
