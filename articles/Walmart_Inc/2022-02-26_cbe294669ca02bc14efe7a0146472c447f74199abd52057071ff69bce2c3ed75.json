  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Container Ships  Have Edge in Talks  Over Freight Rates  ----  By Costas Paris",
  "text": "<p>   Container ship operators and big importers such as IKEA and Walmart Inc. will soon negotiate freight rates that could affect the prices consumers pay for everything from jeans to cars. </p><p>   Yearlong freight contracts, which contribute up to three-quarters of annual revenue for ship operators, will largely be settled at the TPM conference in Long Beach, Calif., this coming week. The average price to move a 40-foot box from China to the U.S. West Coast is likely to be between $7,000 and $8,000, a record high for annual freight pacts and higher than last year's average of around $5,500, according to executives of carriers and importers involved in the talks. </p><p>   After two years of supply-chain disruptions and transportation delays through the Covid-19 pandemic, importers are putting a premium on reliability and predictability of services, with some seeking longer-term freight contracts, analysts say. More than a quarter of all shipping containers entering the U.S. are cargo for large importers such as Walmart and Amazon.com Inc., among others, according to ship operators and freight forwarders. </p><p>   \"We are now increasingly seeing importers sign up to yearly contracts early as well as to contracts of a longer duration,\" said Lars Jensen, chief executive officer of Denmark-based advisory firm Vespucci Maritime. \"It is about managing risk in an environment where the uncertainty about the stability of the supply chain in 2022 continues to be very high.\" </p><p>   Representatives from several carriers and cargo owners declined to comment on the freight talks. A range of companies in recent months have said higher transportation costs or efforts to get around supply-chain issues have eaten into their profit margins, with some projecting expenses to remain at elevated levels this year. </p><p>   \"We've never had such market dynamics, with the liners holding all the cards,\" said Patrik Berglund, CEO of Norway-based transportation data and procurement specialist Xeneta. \"The top five operators control three-quarters of all container capacity. That's a lot of pricing power to very few players.\" </p><p>   Earnings for container shippers took off during the pandemic, as demand for manufactured goods like appliances, cars and home-improvement materials soared, with not enough ships to move them. At the same time, labor shortages from Covid-19 outbreaks at ports across the world and not enough truck, rail and warehousing capacity extended delivery times. </p><p>   To replenish falling inventories, a number of importers booked sailings with spot rates that were separate from their annual freight contracts. Some importers paid daily rates of more than $20,000 per box in sailings across the Pacific Ocean last year, with vessels waiting for weeks to unload cargo at choked ports that had no space to bring in more containers. Large importers also went as far as chartering their own ships to get around port delays. </p><p>   Spot prices to send a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles have eased but continue to hover around $16,000, according to the Freightos Baltic Index, compared with about $4,700 a year earlier. </p><p></p>",
