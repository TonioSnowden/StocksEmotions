  "text": "<p>Over the past six months, Amazon leadership instructed its private-label team to slash the list of items and not to reorder many of them, the people said. Executives discussed reducing its private-label assortment in the U.S. by well over half, one of them said.</p><p>The move was initiated after a review of the business by Dave Clark, a longtime Amazon executive who took over as head of its global consumer business in January 2021, the people said. Mr. Clark left the company last month. As a result of that review, Mr. Clark pushed the team to focus on bestselling commodity goods, along the lines of Target Corp.'s \"Up &amp; Up\" or Walmart Inc.'s \"Great Value\" brands, rather than offer the extensive range of items Amazon currently does, the people said.</p><p>(More to come)</p><p>Write to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon Has Been Slashing Private-Label Selection Amid Weak Sales</p>",
