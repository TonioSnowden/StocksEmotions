  "title": "Stocks Continue Fall After Wednesday Selloff; S&P 500 nears bear-market territory; 10-year Treasury yields fall",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.9% Thursday, putting it about 15% below its all-time closing high. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which entered bear-market territory earlier this year, pared early losses and was recently up 0.2%.</p><p>Kohl's gained 1% in Thursday trading despite saying sales weakened in April, making it the latest retailer to point to inflationary pressures on demand. Walmart and Target this week said higher costs ate into profits in the latest quarter, leading to a selloff of their shares that rippled through the broader market.</p><p>Cisco Systems tumbled 13% after the communication-equipment firm missed analyst expectations for its quarterly results. BJ's Wholesale Club said gasoline sales boosted revenue and profit in its first quarter, sending shares 10% higher.</p><p>\"The critical bit here is how earnings hold up,\" said Desmond Lawrence, senior investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \"We're in a very uncertain time, so we expect more volatility.\"</p><p>Investors bought government bonds, perceived as a haven asset in times of economic uncertainty. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.805% from 2.884% Wednesday. The move put yields, which had shot up for much of the year as the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, on course to fall for seven in nine trading days. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Labor Department said new applications for unemployment benefitsrose for the third week in a row. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, remain historically low.</p><p>Earnings reports from some of America's biggest retailers in recent days added to concern that the highest rate of inflation in four decades is catching up with U.S. consumers and pitching the economy toward a recession. Investors were already grappling with the end of an era of loose monetary policy that had stoked big gains for stocks and other riskier assets.</p><p>The war in Ukraine, meanwhile, is adding to the inflationary pressures prompting the Fed to embark on a series of interest-rate rises and to reduce its bondholdings. And Covid-19 shutdowns in China have led to a sharp slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.</p><p>The combination of factors has fed into steep losses for stocks and some corporate bonds, and many investors expect the volatility to continue. \"The price action suggests it's not over,\" said Philip Saunders, a portfolio manager at Ninety One, an asset manager based in the U.K. and South Africa.</p><p>The last time the S&amp;P 500 fell into a bear market was during the pandemic panic in March 2020. It was short lived, and the market quickly launched on a two-year rally that peaked this Jan. 3. The Dow industrials, which are more weighted to old-line industrial companies and banking stocks, has performed less badly and is still some ways from bear market territory.</p><p>\"Throw monetary policy tightening into the mix, we've got a recipe for volatility and investor jitteriness,\" said Clara Cheong, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>In energy markets, global oil benchmark Brent crude fell 1.6% to $107.36 a barrel.</p><p>International stocks retreated, tracking the U.S. selloff. The Stoxx Europe 600 shed 1.7%, led lower by shares of financial-services and food-and-beverage companies. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 2.5% as shares of Tencent dropped 6.5% after the videogame giant reported its worst quarterly profit drop since listing in the city.</p><p>Among individual European stocks, Credit Suisse Group lost 2.7% after Fitch Ratings downgraded the bank's credit rating to BBB+. Swiss private bank Julius Baer Gruppe dropped 7% after saying its assets under management fell in the first four months of the year.</p><p>Elsewhere in Asia, the CSI 300 index of the largest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen edged up 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.9% and South Korea's Kospi Composite declined 1.3%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Continue Fall After Wednesday Selloff</p>",
