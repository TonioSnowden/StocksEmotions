  "text": "<p>This week is the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 169 companies reporting, amounting to nearly half of the S&amp;P 500's market cap, according to Credit Suisse. Investors will be keeping a close eye on how companies assess the current economic backdrop and if they are cutting back on business investment.</p><p>Cutting back on investing in new ventures or operations \"tells you that maybe they're worried about the cash they have available and they're not willing to take that longer term view,\" said Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco.</p><p>In premarket trading, shares of Walmart fell 9.3% after the country's largest retailer warned that higher prices for food and fuel were causing consumers to pull back. Target shares also fell 5.1% premarket. The firm noted excess inventories would lead to declining profits going forward in a warning issued in early June.</p><p>General Motors shares fell 3.3% premarket after the car maker's second-quarter profit fell short of estimates. Shares of Raytheon Technologies fell 3.1% premarket after the aerospace and defense company reported second-quarter profit that beat expectations but sales that came up short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>Moody's shares fell 4.3% premarket after the credit rating, research and risk analysis company said its profit and revenue for the second quarter fell. Corning shares dropped 4% after the specialty materials maker's third-quarter guidance fell short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>But the earnings reports also included some bright spots. General Electric shares added 4.1% after the company reported better-than-expected results. Consumer-product manufacturer 3M jumped 4.4% premarket after it said it would spin off its healthcare business to create two public companies. Shares of Archer Daniels Midland added 4.5% following better-than-expected quarterly results.</p><p>Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Alphabet, Visa, Mondelez Internationaland Chipotle Mexican Grillwill report after the closing bell.</p><p>Earnings reports are being scoured for clues as to how corporations are faring in a difficult environment. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point Wednesday for the second straight meeting in an effort to tame inflation. Some investors are worried that the fast tightening of financial conditions will compound economic pressure brought by Covid-19, supply-chain disruptions and the Ukraine war to tip the U.S. economy into recession.</p><p>\"You could see a long period of slower growth,\" Invesco's Ms. Taylor said. \"There's a lot of what's going on right now that can't be modeled.\"</p><p>A wave of fresh economic data is due. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas, will show how home prices fared in May amid rising mortgage rates. Figures are expected at 9 a.m. ET.</p><p>The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, which measures American attitudes toward jobs and the economy, is expected to have declined in July when figures are released at 10 a.m.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.759% from 2.819% Monday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 4.8% from its 5 p.m. ET level Monday to trade at $21,113.72 apiece Tuesday, according to CoinDesk.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 1.8% to $101.95 a barrel.</p><p>European natural-gas prices rose on concerns that Russia's cut to the Nord Stream pipeline could mean a shortage in Europe come winter. Benchmark futures climbed 10% to â‚¬198.00 a megawatt hour, equivalent to $202.35, according to FactSet, adding to a jump on Monday.</p><p>European countries on Tuesday reached a watered-down agreement to curb their consumption of natural gas over the next eight months in an effort to shield their economies from a possible cutoff of Russian supplies.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.1%. UBS Group shares slid 7.1% after the bank reported a small increase in second-quarter earnings, but the results fell short of analysts' expectations. Unilever shares added 2.4% after the retailer said it expects underlying sales growth for the full year to exceed previous guidance, driven by higher prices, although volumes are forecast to be under pressure.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed mostly higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.7%. Alibaba Group Holding will pursue a primary listing of its stock in Hong Kong, hedging its bets as regulatory pressure on Chinese companies grows on both sides of the Pacific.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.8%, and South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 ticked 0.2% lower.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Slip With Major Earnings on Tap</p>",
