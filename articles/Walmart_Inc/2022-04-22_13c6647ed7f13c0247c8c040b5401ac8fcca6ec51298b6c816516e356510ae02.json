  "text": "<p>   I've witnessed \"America's Shoplifting Epidemic\" (Review &amp; Outlook, April 9) twice in recent weeks at Walmart. The thieves scanned and bagged the items but then walked out without paying. The bags passed inspection at the door, if the guard was even paying attention. Each time I reported the thefts to an employee. \"That happens all the time\" was the response. </p><p>   Jill Berry </p><p>   Joliet, Ill. </p><p></p>",
