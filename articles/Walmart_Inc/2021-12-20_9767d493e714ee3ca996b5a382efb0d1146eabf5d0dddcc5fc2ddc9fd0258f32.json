  "text": "<p>Brian Wright of San Diego secured gifts for clients of the communications firm where he is employed by the middle of November to ensure they arrived on time. But the 22-year-old has yet to make any purchases for the roughly eight people on his personal Christmas list.</p><p>\"There's an advantage to late shopping without much of a plan,\" said Mr. Wright, who intends to begin his shopping just days before Christmas. \"You don't know what you don't know. So, I'll just pick from what's available.\"</p><p>The federation has said holiday retail sales this year could rise as much as 11.5% from last year, up from its initial forecast of an increase as much as 10.5% to $859 billion. The industry group defines the holiday season as Nov. 1 through Dec. 31. Chains such as Walmart Inc. reported strong sales heading into Black Friday, while others such as Gap Inc. have warned product shortages would crimp sales.</p><p>Earlier holiday shopping contributed to October retail sales rising 1.7% from the month before. Sales rose more modestly in November, which economists attributed to lingering inflation and supply shortages in addition to consumers' purchases happening earlier in the season.</p><p>So far, consumers have done more of their holiday shopping at physical stores this year than in 2020, when a spike in Covid-19 infections put a damper on traffic.</p><p>If the current season's trend continues, there should be a surge in store visits from shoppers buying last-minute gifts and groceries, although it is too early to tell how the new Omicron variant might impact consumer behavior, said Ethan Chernofsky, vice president of marketing for data analytics firm Placer.ai.</p><p>\"Ship-by\" dates for the least expensive services offered by the U.S. parcel carriers have passed, making online shopping a potentially risky option for people who want their orders delivered by Christmas Eve.</p><p>The last Saturday before Christmas is consistently the second-busiest shopping day for stores by traffic of the holiday season after Black Friday, said Peter McCall, a retail services consultant for Sensormatic Solutions, which tracks store foot traffic. Despite the increase in early shopping this year, \"Panic Saturday\" is expected to hold on to that spot when the final data come in, he said.</p>",
