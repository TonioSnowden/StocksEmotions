  "title": "Contaminated-Baby-Formula Investigation Turns Murky; CDC says it is unlikely to find definitive link between sickened infants and Abbott plant in Michigan",
  "text": "<p>Food and Drug Administration inspectors found traces of the bacteria, cronobacter sakazakii, at Abbott's Michigan plant in February, raising the possibility that contaminated formula from the plant had caused the infants' illnesses. The FDA declined to comment on whether its inspection in February was prompted by reports of cronobacter illness in infants.</p><p>Cronobacter is a common bacteria, but typically doesn't affect healthy adults. It is a danger to infants, whose immune systems aren't strong enough to defend against it, though such cases are thought to be rare. Cronobacter bacteria are known to survive in dry foods such as powdered baby formula.</p><p>But when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed the genetic makeup of bacteria found in the Abbott plant and two of the four infected babies, the results didn't confirm a connection. If genetic sequences from the samples had matched, it would have gone a long way to establishing a connection to the manufacturing plant. But the babies' bacteria didn't match each other or the strains found in Abbott's plant.</p><p>\"It all leaves the entire situation in a big uncertain mess,\" said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota and a former epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, who isn't involved in the investigation.</p><p>Powdered baby formula can also become contaminated during preparation as it is combined with water, said Aliyar Cyrus Fouladkhah, associate professor at Tennessee State University's department of agricultural and environmental sciences. There have been sporadic cases of infants catching the bacteria from the natural environment, said Dr. Fouladkhah, and researchers in the past have found the bacteria on refrigerators, kitchen sinks and countertops.</p><p>In this case, one patient sample did match a cronobacter sample found in opened infant formula from the patient's home, a CDC spokeswoman said. \"It is possible that the cases included in this investigation occurred due to contamination of the formula after it was opened, which is how cronobacter often gets into powdered formula,\" she said.</p><p>The investigation is more complex than typical outbreaks because cronobacter isn't among the diseases healthcare professionals are asked to report to the CDC, and because there is no routine surveillance for the bacteria.</p><p>\"It is unlikely that a definitive link will be found,\" the spokeswoman said.</p><p>The FDA said the investigation is continuing. The CDC said it hasn't been notified of additional cases of potentially related infections, and that there is no pending testing related to this investigation.</p><p>FDA inspectors said five samples collected from surfaces in Abbott's Michigan plant tested positive for cronobacter, but that none came from areas that typically come into direct contact with the powdered formula. The FDA said an analysis of product samples from the plant tested negative for cronobacter.</p><p>The FDA said in March that it had removed a case of salmonella illness from its investigation after determining there wasn't enough information to definitively link the illness to powdered formula</p><p>The FDA conducted 19 inspections of the Michigan plant in fiscal years 2009 through 2021, according to agency data. FDA inspectors said they found potential violations at the facility from 2019 through March 2022, including powdered formula that tested positive for cronobacter in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>\"This remains an open investigation with many moving parts,\" an FDA spokeswoman said.</p><p>Abbott doesn't believe the four infant illnesses were caused by contamination at its plant, a spokesman said. \"Like the FDA, we have not found any cronobacter sakazakii or salmonella in any of our testing of distributed products,\" the Abbott spokesman said.</p><p>In February, Abbott issued recalls for certain lots of powdered formula sold under the brand names Similac, Alimentumâ€¯and EleCare because of the risk of possible contamination with cronobacter. Abbott's Michigan plant has stopped production while the company works with the FDA to resolve the problems cited by FDA inspectors, the company and the FDA have said. FDA inspectors also found standing water in powdered-formula production areas.</p><p>Abbott issued a recall as a precautionary measure while the company completed additional analyses, the spokesman said.</p><p>The recalls have exacerbated a shortage of formula around the U.S., where large retailers including Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. have placed limits on how much baby formula consumers can purchase online or in certain stores. Abbott said it is increasing production at a factory in Europe and airfreighting supplies to the U.S. to help alleviate shortages.</p><p>That the FDA found five distinct cronobacter samples at Abbott's Michigan plant suggests other strains could have been circulating there too, including those that sickened the infants, said Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, who isn't involved in the investigation.</p><p>\"Testing food is very limited because it's never going to be representative of the entire lot,\" said Dr. Diez-Gonzalez.</p><p>Proving the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness is difficult, even in cases when bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli sicken many people, Dr. Diez-Gonzalez said. Investigations can be harder when dealing with cronobacter illnesses because the number of infants infected is so small, he said.</p><p>\"You have very little evidence to work with, but the risk is so great you have to take action,\" said Dr. Diez-Gonzalez.</p><p>Write to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com</p><p>Contaminated-Baby-Formula Investigation Turns Murky</p>",
