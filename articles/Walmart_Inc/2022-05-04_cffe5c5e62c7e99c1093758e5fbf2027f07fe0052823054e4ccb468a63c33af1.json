  "text": "<p>CVS Health Corp. first-quarter sales rose more than 11% as the pharmacy chain continued to benefit from administering Covid-19 vaccines and selling at-home tests.</p><p>The Woonsocket, R.I.-based company said Wednesday that it administered more than six million Covid-19 tests and over eight million Covid vaccines in the first three months of the year.</p><p>Demand for Covid-19 testing surged during the start of the year as the wave of cases driven by the Omicron variant swept through the U.S. The company's same-store sales, which include stores open at least 12 months plus digital channels, grew by 10.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier, shortly after the first vaccines had been authorized.</p><p>CVS logged $76.83 billion in revenue in the period, which included a 9.2% sales increase in the retail segment, as consumers scooped up take-home test kits. At the same time, in-store Covid-19 testing decreased.</p><p>CVS executives warned in February that they didn't expect the authorization of a new Covid-19 booster shot this year and that the benefits from Covid-19-related sales could wane, especially in the second half of 2022.</p><p>The drugstore chain has won over new customers throughout the pandemic and executives expect some of those shoppers to stick around.</p><p>CVS, drugstore rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., grocery chains and big-box stores such as Walmart Inc. have played prominent roles in the U.S. effort to distribute Covid-19 vaccinations across the country. Many have also been key to the federal effort to make available rapid, at-home Covid-19 tests.</p><p>Before the pandemic, CVS and other drugstores were struggling to fend off a growing number of online rivals. Covid-19 has proved a welcome tailwind. Now, CVS is in the midst of trying to remake itself as a broad healthcare provider. The retailer said last year it would close about 900 of its around 10,000 stores over three years and open more primary-care clinics.</p><p>Staffing shortages have stressed both CVS and Walgreens as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians have scrambled to juggle Covid-19 testing and vaccines with filling prescriptions and serving customers.</p><p>CVS has seen its costs rise, in part due to wage increases, over the past year. Total cost of products sold rose to $45.51 billion in the quarter, up from $40.90 billion a year earlier.</p><p>In the three months ended March 31, CVS posted a quarterly profit of $2.32 billion, or $1.74 a share, up from $2.22 billion, or $1.68 a share, in the year-ago period.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings were $2.22 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $2.17 a share. Sales also came in ahead of consensus views.</p><p>Sales rose nearly 13% in its healthcare benefits segment. In the pharmacy services segment, sales rose almost 9%. And in the retail segment, sales rose more than 9%.</p><p>The company raised its 2022 earnings outlook slightly, now expecting per-share earnings between $8.20 a share and $8.40 a share, an increase of 10 cents on either end.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Sales Up 11%, Lifted by Covid-19 Demand</p>",
