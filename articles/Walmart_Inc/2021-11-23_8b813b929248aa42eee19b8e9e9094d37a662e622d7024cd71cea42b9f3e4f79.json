  "text": "<p>The counties argued that by enabling the opioid crisis, the pharmacy companies created a public nuisance. Each county said the crisis cost them about $1 billion in costs related to law enforcement, social services and courts.</p><p>The verdict in the bellwether case is being closely watched by attorneys elsewhere as similar cases play out against pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors.</p><p>Plaintiffs attorneys for the counties issued a joint statement calling the verdict an \"overdue reckoning.\"</p><p>\"For decades, pharmacy chains have watched as the pills flowing out of their doors cause harm and failed to take action as required by law,\" the attorneys said. \"Instead, these companies responded by opening up more locations, flooding communities with pills, and facilitating the flow of opioids into an illegal, secondary market.\"</p><p>Michael DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, said the company strongly disagreed with the verdict.</p><p>\"Pharmacists fill legal prescriptions written by DEA-licensed doctors who prescribe legal, FDA-approved substances to treat actual patients in need,\" he said. \"We look forward to the appeals court review of this case, including the misapplication of public nuisance law.\"</p><p>Lawyers for the other companies couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com</p><p>Walgreens, Walmart and CVS Pharmacies Contributed to Opioid Epidemic, Ohio Jury Finds</p>",
