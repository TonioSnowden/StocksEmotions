  "title": "Target Says Rising Crime and Theft Are Hurting Its Results; Retailer is investing in training and technology to deter criminal activity at its stores",
  "text": "<p>\"Along with other retailers, we've seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business,\" Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on the call.</p><p>A Target spokesman said Wednesday that retail crime incidents at Target were up 50% from a year ago. He didn't say the number of incidents that happened each year. Target has more than 1,900 stores in the U.S., according to its website. Company executives said they expect retail theft and inventory problems to worsen.</p><p>Target shares dropped more than 12% on Wednesday after the company's quarterly profits missed analysts' expectations. The retailer lowered its forecasts for the holiday season, saying shoppers slowed their spending in recent weeks amid high inflation, rising rates and overall economic uncertainty.</p><p>Target, along with retailers including Walmart and Kohl's, has been offering discounts to get rid of excess inventory it accumulated this year after consumers began spending less on goods.</p><p>But Target is also trying to combat a different inventory problem. The company said it is working with others to stop shortages stemming from theft, which executives said was a problem across the industry. Retailers Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. didn't mention crime in their earnings reports this week.</p><p>Organized retail crime was a \"modest pressure\" on Home Depot over the last quarter, a spokeswoman said. The company has used technology to try to make it more difficult to steal from stores, she added.</p><p>Walmart didn't immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.</p><p>Target said it was investing in training and technology to deter theft, with changes already being rolled out in some stores. The company spokesman declined to elaborate on the measures, saying it would defeat the point to outline how the company plans to stop theft.</p><p>Theft is a growing problem in U.S. stores, retailers say. Organized crime rings have stolen billions of dollars worth of items from stores, the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail, a trade association, has said. Companies including Ulta Beauty Inc. and TJX Cos., which runs TJ Maxx and Marshalls, have said they earmarked money for investigating and stopping thieves.</p><p>Retailers lost $94.5 billion last year because of organized theft, employee theft and other related factors, the National Retail Federation said in a September report. That figure was up from $90.8 billion in 2020.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you noticed an increase in shoplifting? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Last year, 21 executives from retailers including Target and Home Depot sent a letter to Congress expressing concern over an increase in organized retail crime. They urged legislators to pass a law that could deter people from selling stolen goods online.</p><p>Law-enforcement officials have said Amazon.com Inc. is one of the biggest outlets for criminals to sell items they took from stores.</p><p>Stores including Home Depot and Best Buy Co. ramped up security during the holiday shopping season last year. Criminal groups committed a string of high-profile thefts across the U.S. over last Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Target Says Rising Crime and Theft Are Hurting Its Results</p>",
