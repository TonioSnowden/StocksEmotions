  "text": "<p>The document request isn't part of any law-enforcement action, the FTC said in a press release. Instead, the agency said it is looking to understand the reasons behind the widespread supply-chain problems that have crimped economic growth.</p><p>The agency is also seeking documents and information from&#xa0;Kroger&#xa0;Co. KR, &#xa0;C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers Inc., Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc., McLane Co.,&#xa0;Tyson Foods&#xa0;Inc. TSN,&#xa0;and&#xa0;Kraft Heinz&#xa0;Co. KHC.&#xa0;&#xa0;The companies have 45 days to respond.</p><p>The order will require the companies to detail how they are navigating the&#xa0;supply- chain crisis, including how it has affected the availability of transportation, delayed orders and led to increased prices. The FTC also wants to know what companies are doing to fix the problems and how they allocate products among stores when products are scarce.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Ghost kitchens are proving to be a messy business, as Reef Global shows.</p><p>Workers quit jobs in droves to become their own bosses.</p>",
