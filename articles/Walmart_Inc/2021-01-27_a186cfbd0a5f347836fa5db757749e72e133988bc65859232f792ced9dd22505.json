  "text": "<p>Pepco, the European discount chain that owns Poundland, has reported resilient sales growth in its most important trading quarter to the end of December as its owner restarted the process of selling it off.</p> <p>Same-store sales at the group, which is owned by the heavily indebted South African conglomerate Steinhoff, fell 2.1 per cent in the quarter because of lockdowns that closed some of its central and eastern European operations. But sales at those stores that remained open rose 5.5 per cent.</p> <p>These included the Poundland chain in the UK and its Dealz shops in Ireland, both of which were classed as essential retailers. Sales grew 4.3 per cent over the period for these brands.</p> <p>For the Pepco chain of more than 2,000 discount clothing shops, sales were up 6.6 per cent at stores trading throughout but down 6 per cent overall.</p> <p>Total group sales were up 9 per cent after the effect of exchange rate fluctuations were stripped out, reflecting new store openings.</p> <p>Andy Bond, the former Asda boss who is now chief executive of Pepco, said he “felt good about the resilience of the business in these tough times”.</p> <p>Although blanket store closures because of the pandemic were mainly confined to Slovenia and the Czech Republic, he said that “every single store in eastern Europe was impacted by Covid in some way”, including restrictions on opening times, products on sale or numbers of customers in stores.</p> <p>At Poundland, which accounts for about a fifth of group profits, trading was boosted by the introduction of frozen food ranges, following last year's acquisition of Fulton Foods, and the relaunch of its homewares range.</p> <p>About 23 per cent of Poundland revenue now comes from products priced above and below the £1 price level, part of a strategy to expand its ranges. “As we've introduced more price points in each category it has been universally successful,” said Mr Bond.</p> <p>The sales update followed a statement to the South African stock exchange from Steinhoff on Monday, which said that efforts to sell Pepco would now resume after being suspended when the pandemic began.</p> <p>The group, which needs to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/864e1a92-9292-4932-be7f-b2b50fef6747\">sell assets to reduce debt</a> after an accounting scandal, said a “range of strategic options” were under consideration.</p> <p>“The process remains in its early stages and no definitive decision has been taken with respect to any specific course of action or timing.”</p> <p>Although Pepco does not sell online, arguing that its small average basket sizes and low prices are incompatible with ecommerce, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/236b692b-71e1-4e65-a729-13811ffbfd08\">it is opening stores rapidly</a>.</p> <p>It opened 87 in the first quarter, including in new markets such as Italy and Serbia, which it said were trading “measurably ahead of expectations”. The company remains on track to open more than 400 stores over the full year.</p> <p>Mr Bond said that while Pepco was “open-minded” on ecommerce “we do not get the sense that it's the way people want to shop for deep value” and pointed out that several other high-profile retailers had prospered without selling online.</p> <p>Pepco's sales are likely to exceed £3bn in the current financial year, meaning that in revenue terms it is not far behind B&amp;M, the listed discounter that joined the FTSE 100 last year.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'European discount chain Pepco reports ‘resilient' growth' FT.com 27 January.
