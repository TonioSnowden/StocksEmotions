  "text": "<p>Deep below the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival lies a dark secret: a dingy basement market where schlocky low-budget movies are bought and sold like lumber, financing is scraped together and dreams are born or — more often — die. This is one of the settings for <em>Clapboard Jungle</em>, an unblinking autobiographical documentary in which tirelessly aspiring Canadian film-maker Justin McConnell takes us through the toils of a stalling career in the indie horror movie biz.</p> <p>Initially, he is no more appealing than the gorefests he is touting as he sits in a grotty apartment playing back yet another rejection message while halfheartedly doing bicep curls. Pale, overweight and perpetually sweaty, if success is 99 per cent perspiration, he is surely well on his way. Yet for all the hallmarks of loserdom, McConnell is beaten down but never quite beaten: when one project stalls, he shoots another short, writes another slasher, takes it to more markets, starts assembling financing again, like an umpteenth house of cards. And the less anyone wants to invest in his films, the more invested you become, wondering if this underdog will ever have his day.</p> <p>Dotted through this quixotic journey is a gaggle of talking heads relating their own travails. Some are high priests of horror: George A. Romero, Guillermo del Toro, Paul Schrader. The rest are mostly a who's who of who's that? If you ever wanted to hear the makers of video-store relics such as <em>Critters 2</em> and <em>Leprechaun 3</em> dispense their wisdom, this is your chance. As a how-to guide on how to make it, it's haphazard; as an ethnographic study it's fascinating. Observing this oddly loveable tribe of mostly male, seminocturnal creatures in their shapeless black T-shirts and bad facial hair, you may begin to understand what makes them tick.</p> <p>And what of our haggard hero? For him a modicum of success — with a project called <em>Lifechanger</em> of all things — is vindication enough. Still pale, still sweaty, still with a wardrobe by Walmart, but suddenly wearing something new too: a triumphant gleam in his eye. At least he now knows he is chasing a dream, not just a delusion. </p> <p>★★★☆☆</p> <p><em>On digital platforms from April 19</em></p><p>Source: Raphael Abraham 2021 'Clapboard Jungle — lifting the lid on the indie horror film business' FT.com 14 April.
