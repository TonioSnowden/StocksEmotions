  "title": "Stocks Jump on Promising Inflation Data",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 34.48 points, or 0.9%, to 3991.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 56.22 points, or 0.2%, to 33592.92. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 162.19 points, or 1.4%, to 11358.41 as tech stocks extended their recent run.</p><p>Investors have fixated on signals about the path of inflation as they try to gauge when the Federal Reserve will moderate its aggressive campaign of interest-rate increases. The central bank's swift lifting of rates as it seeks to tame price increases has helped drive the S&amp;P 500 down 16% in 2022.</p><p>Data Tuesday showed that increases in U.S. supplier prices slowed in October. The producer-price index rose 8% on a 12-month basis, down from a revised increase of 8.4% in September and much lower than the 11.7% increase in March.</p><p>Stocks gained as investors latched onto the additional sign that inflation may have turned the corner.</p><p>Last week, the S&amp;P 500 notched its largest two-day percentage gain since 2020 after consumer-price data showed that inflation eased in October to its slowest pace since January.</p><p>\"We've obviously been through a very tough period for inflation, but there really is now good evidence that the worst is behind us,\" said Charlie Bobrinskoy, portfolio manager and head of the investment group at Ariel Investments.</p><p>Comments this week from a senior official at the Fed bolstered expectations that the central bank will moderate its raising of interest rates. Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said Monday that it likely will be appropriate soon to shift to a slower pace of rate increases.</p><p>Asian stocks rallied, pushed higher by China's new plan to ease pressure on its property market and its relaxing of Covid-19 pandemic controls. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 4.1%. The index is now back in a bull market, measured as a rise of 20% or more from a recent low. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite gained 1.6%.</p><p>Early Wednesday, the Hang Seng was down 0.6% and the Shanghai benchmark was down 0.2%.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.4%.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 3.798% from 3.865% Monday. The benchmark government bond's yield has climbed from 1.496% at the end of 2021.</p><p>The jump in yields has threatened the long-popular view that investors should load up on stocks because they had no alternative. An increase in the appeal of lower-risk assets could weigh on the outlook for major equity indexes.</p><p>Among individual stocks, Walmart shares jumped $9.05, or 6.5%, to $147.44 after the retailer reported revenue that topped analyst expectations and raised its fiscal-year guidance.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rose $7.66, or 11%, to $80.46 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a stake in the chip maker.</p><p>Investors are continuing to watch for contagion from cryptocurrency markets, which have been hammered in the past week as the fallout continues from the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. On Tuesday, cryptocurrency prices were relatively stable.</p><p>Oil prices rose, with Brent crude adding 0.8% to $93.86 a barrel.</p>",
