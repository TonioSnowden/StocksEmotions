  "title": "EXCHANGE --- In Tech, There's Regular-Big And There's Pandemic-Big --- After a year of booming revenue and earnings, five companies now account for nearly a quarter of the total stock-market value of the S&P 500",
  "text": "<p>The quintet set records for sales and profits. Revenue at Apple, the world's most highly valued company, jumped 54% to the highest level it's ever hit for the first three months of the year. Amazon logged its fourth straight record quarterly profit -- a stretch when its total earnings exceeded those of the previous three years combined.</p><p>\"Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. They're accelerating,\" said Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, whose revenue rose 19% in the latest quarter.</p><p>The stock market gives a glimpse of just how enormous these companies have become in this extraordinary period: Combined market value for the five companies is now over $8 trillion, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total value of the companies in the S&amp;P 500. That is nearly double the percentage five years ago.</p><p>$47 billion</p><p>APPLE</p><p>Apple's iPhone sales from January to March. That was a 66% jump from a year earlier, thanks to new models with next-generation 5G technology. Consumers spent more on the premium iPhones, too, with the average retail price in the U.S. up $52 from a year earlier to $847, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners LLC.</p><p>145 million</p><p>MICROSOFT</p><p>Active daily users for Microsoft's workplace collaboration tool, Teams. That's almost double the year-ago figure, and up from around 20 million in November 2019. Mr. Nadella has said the pandemic accelerated adoption of a range of digital tools, benefiting its operations from business software to cloud-computing to videogames.</p><p>950,000</p><p>AMAZON</p><p>U.S. employees for Amazon, which had 500,000 U.S. workers about a year ago. The company hired at a brisk pace to meet pandemic-induced demand for essential goods and shorten delivery times. Amazon is now the country's second-largest non-government employer after Walmart Inc., and it said this past week it is hiring for tens of thousands of positions across the country.</p><p>49%</p><p>ALPHABET</p><p>Advertising revenue growth in the latest quarter at YouTube, Google's video arm. YouTube became the nation's entertainment hub during a stay-at-home year, attracting so many viewers that its ad sales hit $6 billion in the quarter, just 16% less than Netflix Inc. generated for the period. Google squeezed more money out of brands with new ad formats that enable direct purchases within YouTube.</p><p>3.45 billion</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>People who used Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp at least once within the last month. That's up nearly a sixth from the 2.99 billion figure a year earlier. As people stuck at home lived more of their lives online and sought out more information and interaction, the company's seemingly ubiquitous reach grew even further.</p>",
