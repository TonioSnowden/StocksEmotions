  "title": "U.S. News: U.S. Campaign Will Press For Distancing and Masks",
  "text": "<p>The decision to focus on masks and distancing and to temporarily narrow its vaccine campaign announced Jan. 21 reflects what health authorities have been saying for weeks: Mask wearing, social distancing, and testing are critical as new variants spread, because there might not be enough vaccines to inoculate most people in the U.S. until late summer. Meanwhile, states including New York, Massachusetts, Iowa, North Dakota, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington have relaxed mask mandates or indoor-dining restrictions.</p><p>Scarcity of vaccine doses and complications in the rollout have led to long waits for shots in many states.</p><p>Vaccine skepticism remains a barrier to getting shots to populations most at risk. About one-third of Black adults say they plan to avoid the vaccine, compared with about one-fifth of Hispanic and white adults who don't plan to get vaccinated, according to recent survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p><p>The virus has killed Black, Latino, Native Americans and Pacific Islanders at double the rate of Asian-Americans and whites, according to adjusted mortality rates from APM Research Lab, which analyzes national data.</p><p>Some public-health experts said the government shouldn't delay any message designed to combat vaccine skepticism.</p><p>\"It takes time to build trust,\" said Leana Wen, a health policy professor at George Washington University. \"This is not something that should wait.\"</p><p>The campaign focused on masks and distancing will build on initiatives already under way, including spots featuring President Biden and first lady Jill Biden urging social distancing and testing in a prerecorded Super Bowl appearance and Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical officer for the administration, on mask wearing, according to a person familiar with the plans.</p><p>The Biden campaign has been stressing public-health practices as a way to counter governors and local leaders who are relaxing measures such as mask wearing and indoor restrictions. Members of Mr. Biden's Covid-19 team this week said in a briefing they are encouraging governors to uphold public-health measures aimed at curtailing spread of the virus.</p><p>\"We're in such a critical period to combating the virus, and hope to continue to work to persuade and partner with states and localities to continue to follow sensible public-health measures until such time as we're in a situation where the case rates are down -- are down lower,\" Andy Slavitt, White House senior adviser for the Covid Response Team, said Monday.</p><p>The variant first identified in the U.K., known as B.1.1.7, is spreading rapidly in the U.S. and is expected to become dominant in March. It is about 40% to 70% more transmissible.</p><p>A number of states, localities, businesses and nonprofits are ramping up their own messaging campaigns to encourage people to get vaccinated.</p><p>Wyoming has launched ads to counter vaccine skepticism, and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, on Feb. 5 announced a $2.5 million campaign urging residents to get vaccinated, with ads in English and Spanish.</p><p>The Ad Council, a nonprofit that helps make public-service campaigns, will be rolling out spots about the vaccine and public-health measures with the Covid Collaborative, a coalition of experts on health, the economy and education. They have raised $37 million for their vaccine education initiative from companies such as General Motors Co. and Walmart Inc.</p><p>CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, a nonprofit and the largest health-care company in the mid-Atlantic region, on Feb. 5 launched a campaign in Washington, Maryland, and northern Virginia about the importance of the vaccine.</p>",
