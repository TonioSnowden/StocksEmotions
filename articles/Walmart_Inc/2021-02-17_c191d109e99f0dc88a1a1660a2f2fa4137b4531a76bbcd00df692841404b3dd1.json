  "text": "<p>2250 GMT - The annual investor day for infrastructure investor Infratil revealed \"stronger signals\" of a push into Asia renewable energy and niche data opportunities, says Macquarie. The bank, which is keeping a neutral rating on Infratil, said management also indicated there had been no \"reengagement\" from Australia's largest pension fund, AustralianSuper , following Infratil's rejection of its surprise takeover offer in December. UBS , meanwhile, said investor day highlighted Infratil's growth options and the potential for a step change in earnings from some investments, helping to underpin its buy rating. (stephen.wright@wsj.com)</p><p>2232 GMT - Janus Henderson has trimmed its exposure to renewables a little by pulling back on the likes of Vestas or Neste and upping bets on renewables developers including Algonquin, NextEra, Enel and Iberdrola , says Daniel Sullivan, head of global natural resources. He sees better risk-reward in those stocks, he says. Janus nevertheless continues to favor renewable energy over fossil fuels, he says. While the outlook for inflation and the US dollar suggest oil prices may head higher, \"we are mindful of integrated oil,\" Sullivan says. \"The sector is pricing in $50-$60 per barrel, meaning that it doesn't look particularly attractive in our eyes unless the long end of the oil-price curve improves\" and \"given the multi-decade move away from fossil fuels, it's hard to see that happening.\" (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)</p><p>2012 GMT - It's perhaps unfair to blame any one energy source on the massive power outages from a brutally cold and snowy storm that swept through Texas Sunday night into Monday, leaving millions of Texans without electricity just when they needed it most. Still, data from the US government 's EIA would seem to indicate wind-driven electricity generation collapsed more than anything else as the turbines froze up. The EIA data of Texas's ERCOT electricity grid indicates wind fell 92% to just 649 megawatt hours between Sunday at 8 pm and Monday at 8 pm, while natural gas fell 30% to 30,917 MWh, nuclear fell 26% to 3,785 MWh, and coal fell 25% to 8,023 MWh. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</p><p>2005 GMT - Engine No. 1, the recently launched activist fund seeking four board seats at Exxon Mobil , reported a $38M position in the energy giant as of Dec. 31, according to a Tuesday filing. The firm, which makes both active and passive investments, also reported small positions in a handful of other large companies including Amazon.com , Microsoft and Square Inc. The firm was launched by tech investor Chris James in December with around $250M under management and focuses on so-called impact investing. (cara.lombardo@wsj.com; @CaraRLombardo)</p><p>1839 GMT - US benchmark oil prices rise 1% to end above $60 for the first time since Jan. 7, 2020 as a brutal string of winter storms sweep across oil-rich Texas and Oklahoma, causing significant disruptions to crude-oil production. Prices had climbed even higher overnight, nearing $61 a barrel, but retreated some during the NY trading session as investors worried the storms wouldn't only hurt supplies, but would also hurt demand, especially as more than 10% of US refining capacity is forced to shut due to equipment failures or precautionary shutdowns. Today's 1% rise to a closing price of $60.05 a barrel is the tenth increase in the past 11 sessions. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</p><p>1732 GMT - Grain traders informally surveyed by Dow Jones say that they expect the EIA's ethanol report this week to show a decline in domestic ethanol production. Production is expected to decline by as much as 100,000 barrels per day, reflecting the continued slowdown in the economy amid lingering issues with coronavirus and winter storms snarling travel in much of the country. Demand for corn, which is linked heavily to the ethanol market, is a main driver for corn futures Tuesday, with the most-active CBOT contract up 2%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)</p><p>1713 GMT - A nearly unprecedented, severe batch of cold and snow has turned Texas, the largest US state except for Alaska and the most-populous state except for California, into a desolate winter wasteland of icy, empty highways and shuttered businesses. What's more, many regions including Dallas are preparing for yet another snowstorm later this evening. Walmart has temporarily closed most of its Texas stores--including ones from the northern panhandle above Amarillo to those along Mexico's border at Brownsville. The website PowerOutage.US says more than 4M electricity customers in Texas are without power, while the city of Abilene has had to shut off water completely. A disaster declaration was made for all 254 Texas counties. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</p><p>1749 GMT - European stocks close mostly lower as traders stayed wary, while Wall Street made modest gains on its return from Monday's public holiday. The Stoxx Europe 600 drops 0.06%, the FTSE 100 falls 0.1%, the CAC-40 is flat and the DAX subsides 0.3%. The price of a barrel of Brent crude retreats 0.4% to $63.02. The Dow rises 0.2% as traders set the prospect of US economic stimulus and rising vaccinations against natural jitters about market gains since the start of the month. \"The timid trading in the US reflected a cautious European session,\" says Connor Campbell at Spreadex . (philip.waller@wsj.com)</p><p>1558 GMT - US benchmark oil prices remain higher after a three-day weekend, and are on course for the 10th daily increase over the past 11 sessions, up 0.6% near a 13-month-high $59.82 a barrel. Driving prices higher are worries of up to a 10% drop in crude-oil production in places like Texas's Permian Basin as severely cold weather forces disrupts wellhead activity and freezes up equipment. But refineries are also shutting, which could bearishly mean weaker demand for crude. Saudi Aramco 's 603k bpd Motiva Port Arthur refinery in Texas remains shut due to the cold, the company says, while Exxon confirms it's shutting its 561k Baytown and 362k bpd Beaumont refineries. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</p><p>1429 GMT - The winter storm that left millions of Texans in the dark and prompted a state of emergency has also disrupted the earnings reporting season. Texas-based Occidental Petroleum , Pioneer Natural Resources , Trinity Industries and American Campus Communities all postpone this week's planned 4Q releases to next week due to the harsh winter weather and widespread power outages across the Lone Star State. (colin.kellaher@wsj.com)</p><p>1239 GMT - In the same way a summer heatwave in California revealed the weaknesses of solar power, a severe Texas cold snap is exposing the problems with wind power. Texas grid operator ERCOT's chief executive Bill Magness cites \"frozen wind turbines\" as a major cause of electricity outages that are forcing millions of people in Texas -- the US's top wind-power state -- to bundle up in their homes in the dark with layers of clothes and blankets in sub-freezing temperatures. California -- the US's top solar-power state -- had similar rolling blackouts affecting millions last summer as air-conditioning demand surged during the late-afternoons, just when solar production begins its natural decline.
