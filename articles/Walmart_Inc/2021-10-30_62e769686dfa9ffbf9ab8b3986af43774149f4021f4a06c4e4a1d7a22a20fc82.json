  "text": "<p>\n  Karachi Vice </p><p>\n  By Samira Shackle </p><p>\n  Melville House, 246 pages, $27.99 </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Residents of any American metropolis who think that they live in civic hell because of homeless men on the subway, gangland rat-a-tat in the inner city and shoplifters at Walmart should steal a glance at Karachi for a jolt of harsh perspective. Would they prefer life in this Pakistani conurbation of 20 million people served by 30,000 underpaid (and often easily bribed) cops, a city racked by ethnic violence, political turf wars (fought with AK-47s), territorial battles between crime dons (also fought with AK-47s), and widespread Islamist extremism (expressed in periodic and pitiless public bombings)? </p><p>\n  Add to these ingredients a staggering lack of urban planning and sanitation, chronic water shortages, a barely functioning legal system, unprotected property rights and a total absence of public ambulances, and you have a city of which you will feel bound to ask -- your mouth agape -- how it can even begin to provide a tolerable existence to the people who must live there. And yet, despite being \"the front line of global urbanization at its most unforgiving\" -- as described by Samira Shackle, an Anglo-Pakistani journalist -- Karachi has an \"almost gravitational pull\" for the thousands of people who arrive there each day. They come to \"escape the inequalities of their rural homes\" and to make their fortunes in a place whose population -- fewer than 500,000 at the time of Pakistan's creation in 1947 -- is today more than double that of New York City. </p><p>\n  How do the people of Pakistan's largest city cope with its lawlessness, its choking air and sewers, its venality and its blinding inequalities of income and opportunity? These are some of the questions Ms. Shackle asks in \"Karachi Vice: Life and Death in a Divided City,\" a sociopolitical biography of the city from which her maternal grandparents and their four children left for Britain in the 1970s -- forsaking, as migrants, their own city of migrants. </p><p>\n  Millions of Karachi's residents first arrived as -- or are descended from -- Muslim refugees who fled west to Pakistan from predominantly Hindu India at the time of partition. These migrants, who answered the call to populate the new confessional Muslim state, are still referred to as mohajir (the Urdu word for refugee). It is a label that signals their continued marginalization in a country of indigenous Sindhis, Baloch, Punjabis and Pashtuns. Yet the Mohajirs, now as combus-tible a part of Pakistan's ethnic mosaic as any other group, claim the city of Karachi as their own bastion. </p><p>\n  Ms. Shackle was born in Britain and chose in 2012 to live in Karachi. She quickly found that the city bore little resemblance to the one her family left behind, having become a place with its own tribal geography, whose internal borders you cross at your own peril if you are from the wrong ethnicity or political party. In times of strife, a Pashtun bus driver could be shot dead in a Mohajir neighborhood; a Mohajir resident, straying from his zone of ethnic safety into the fiefdom of others, could be tortured to death by Baloch gangsters. Workers from the militant pro-Mohajir party MQM had better avoid areas controlled by the PPP -- a Sindhi-flavored national party affiliated with the Bhuttos, Pakistan's leading political dynasty -- and all live in fear of the Tehreek-e-Taliban, a largely Pashtun terrorist group whose bloody accomplishments include an attack on Karachi's international airport. </p><p>\n  \"Karachi Vice\" is in the nature of a jigsaw story, pieced together from interviews Ms. Shackle conducted between 2015 and 2019 with five Karachiites who are, in her view, broadly representative of the city's demographic types. They include Safdar, a Pashtun ambulance driver for a private charitable foundation that offers the only ambulance service in this vast city; Parveen, a Baloch woman whose enlightened working-class father permits her to finish high school and become a teacher in a slum classroom; Siraj, an educated Mohajir who works for an NGO -- in Orangi, the largest slum not merely in Karachi but all of Asia -- for which he maps unauthorized homes and alleyways to facilitate basic services to the people who live there; and Jannat, a Sindhi woman whose village on the fringes of an ever-expanding Karachi is swallowed up by real-estate developers who have acquired its land illegally and bulldozed villagers' homes. </p><p>\n  Ms. Shackle's dramatis personae tell tales that teach us not only of Karachi's mighty hardships but also of the breathtaking humanity that lies beneath the city's hellish carapace. The most Westernized of all her interlocutors is Zille, a dutiful son who bowed to his father's wishes that he study for a degree in engineering, only to become a crime reporter on a leading television channel. As his career on camera thrives, he moves his family out of the scruffy and crime-ridden district of Landhi and into the more salubrious neighborhood of Gulshan, where they are \"hardly ever kept awake by gunfire.\" He even buys his own car. </p><p>\n  \"Karachi Vice\" should be read as a companion to Declan Walsh's \"The Nine Lives of Pakistan\" (2020), which portrays the entire country through the lives of nine sociocultural representatives. Although Ms. Shackle confines herself to Karachi, her book is no less exhaustive in its examination of the confounding complexities of Pakistan's society. By the end, a reader is on intimate terms with her characters, willing them on in their fight to survive and their endeavor to keep indignity at bay. </p><p>\n  On his first outing as a trainee ambulance driver, Safdar and his super-visor encounter a body that has been left unattended for some days. \"A cloud of flies formed a buzzing halo and a teeming heap of maggots crawled over every visible part of flesh.\" Safdar vomits in reaction, but instead of receiving sympathy from his mentor he gets a sharp slap to the face. </p><p>\n  Elsewhere, the teacher Parveen -- now working for an NGO that arranges for flood relief -- visits an underworld don to ask for a charitable donation. The don's mansion is in the middle of her own slum, Lyari, and \"the scale of the house and its luxuries was terrifying; it spoke of riches beyond Parveen's imagination and a frightening level of power.\" The spunky Parveen gets into an argument with the don over morality, and leaves empty-handed. \"I just want to tell you,\" she says to him, \"that if someone does not value education, I do not consider them human.\" </p><p>\n  The best stories, inevitably, come from Zille, the TV crime reporter. Much of his job involves breaking news on Karachi's many mafias: the water-tanker mafia, the real-estate mafia, the transport mafia -- even an \"exam mafia.\" Zille was reporting on an organized gang that had been stealing examination papers and sharing the answers with students for a fee. In a city of such cutthroat competition, an extra percentage point on a test score confers an invaluable advantage on an applicant for a place at a medical college or for a scarce government job. Exam mafias are rife in Karachi. And so Zille stands outside an exam center, microphone in hand, reporting on the story. \"He was mid-sentence,\" Ms. Shackle writes, \"when someone walked out of the low-rise building behind him and punched him in the face, knocking the microphone to the ground and leaving him speechless.\" </p><p>\n  Zille gathers his equipment, mops his nose and departs. Karachi to the core, he is bloodied but unbowed. </p><p>\n  Most important, he has his story. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Varadarajan, a Journal contributor, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at New York University Law School's Classical Liberal Institute. </p><p></p>",
