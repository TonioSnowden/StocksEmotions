  "text": "<p>Google can hit refresh after a court battle over copyright. The Supreme Court on Monday ruled the unit of Alphabet isn't liable to Oracle Corp. for copyright infringement based on how it built its Android smartphone-operating system, erasing the prospect of a multibillion-dollar award to Oracle. The court, in a 6-2 opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, threw out a lower-court ruling for Oracle that said Google's Android infringed its copyrights on the Java software platform. The nation's highest court ruled Google's copying of some Java API code was fair use. Alphabet shares added 4.1% Monday.</p><p>ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC</p><p>RDS.A +1.3%</p><p>Shell's pandemic recovery hit a slippery patch thanks to a winter cold snap. The company said Wednesday that gains it made from higher oil prices in the first quarter would be partly offset by disruption related to a winter storm in Texas. As millions of Texans were left without power, the freeze resulted in outages at refineries and chemical plants and disruption of pipeline flows. Oil giants reported some of their worst results on record for 2020, after lockdowns sapped demand for oil and sent prices lower. American depositary shares of Shell gained 1.3% Wednesday.</p><p>NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD.</p><p>NCLH +7.2%</p><p>Cruise companies are anxious to set sail again. Norwegian Cruise Line said Monday it asked federal health authorities to let it depart from U.S. ports starting July 4, saying its vaccination requirement for passengers and crew is a sufficient precaution against Covid-19. Norwegian and other major cruise lines haven't sailed in the U.S. since coronavirus outbreaks halted voyages last year. Norwegian shares rose 7.2% Monday.</p><p>NETFLIX INC.</p><p>NFLX +1.4%</p><p>Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is coming to Netflix. The entertainment giant has reached a multiyear agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment for domestic streaming rights to the studio's theatrical movies, the companies said Thursday. The deal will start with Sony Pictures' 2022 movie slate, and Netflix will have a first-look option to pick up movies Sony is making specifically for streaming platforms. Among the releases that will land on Netflix after their theatrical runs are future \"Spider-Man\" movies. Netflix shares rose 1.4% Thursday.</p><p>GENERAL MOTORS CO.</p><p>GM -1.2%</p><p>A worsening chip shortage offers new roadblocks for General Motors. The auto maker said Thursday that it will halt production at several North American factories and extend shutdowns at others due to semiconductor supply issues. The new plants affected include one in Tennessee and another in Michigan. The moves follow recent news that Ford Motor Co. would deepen North America production cuts. That includes idling for two weeks a factory near its headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., that makes the F-150 pickup truck, its biggest moneymaker. GM shares fell 1.2%.</p><p>MCDONALD'S CORP.</p><p>MCD +0.5%</p><p>McDonald's isn't loving it at Walmart anymore. The fast-food giant is closing hundreds of restaurants located in the largest U.S. retailer's stores as more shopping goes online and fast-food restaurants depend more on drive-through windows for sales. The pandemic has made indoor dining unappealing -- or prohibited -- for many shoppers. Around 150 McDonald's stores will remain at U.S. Walmart locations after another wave of planned closures that are expected by this summer. There were once roughly 1,000 McDonald's restaurants inside Walmart stores. McDonald's shares added 0.5% Friday.</p><p>AMAZON.COM INC.</p><p>AMZN +2.2%</p><p>Amazon workers won't be unionizing in the Yellowhammer State. The e-commerce giant got enough votes to defeat union efforts in Alabama, as an estimated 71% of warehouse workers in Bessemer, Ala., who cast ballots voted against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, according to a Wall Street Journal tally. It's a victory for Amazon in its biggest battle yet against labor-organizing efforts. The election fueled national debate over working conditions at one of the nation's largest employers. Amazon shares gained 2.2% Friday.</p>",
