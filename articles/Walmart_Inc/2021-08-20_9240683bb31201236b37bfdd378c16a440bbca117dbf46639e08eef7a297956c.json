  "text": "<p>“As anticipated, during the quarter we saw a decline in DIY demand versus last year as many families transitioned back to pre-COVID purchase patterns and weekend mobility after Memorial Day,” said Lowe's LOW Chief Executive Marvin Ellison on the earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.</p><p>“But because of the agility of our Total Home strategy, we were able to capitalize on Pro demand, driving growth of 21% this quarter and 49% on a two-year basis. This level of Pro growth would not have been possible without our intense focus on the Pro customer over the past 24 months.”</p><p>See:Lowe's stock gains after surprise growth in sales, profit and same-store sales beat expectations</p><p>In April, Lowe's announced new professional amenities, including a new Pro Zone.</p><p>Raymond James maintained its market perform rating on Lowe's stock despite results that analysts called “impressive.”</p><p>“That said, we remain on the sidelines for now, as we are concerned about more muted near-term performance in 2H21 relative to peers, given Lowe's smaller Pro exposure of ~20%…combined with the need to spend a notable amount of capital on long-term supply chain projects,” wrote analysts led by Bobby Griffin.</p><p>“This was evident in F2Q, with Home Depot's comps outpacing Lowe's by610 basis points.”</p><p>Chief rival Home Depot Inc. HD reported quarterly sales that exceeded $40 billion for the first time on Tuesday, but same-store sales fell short.</p><p>“While&#xa0;Lowe's has made many improvements to its&#xa0;Lowe's For Pro's program, which is reflected in the 21% sales growth it posted for this segment, it is coming from behind as Home Depot is still the preferred choice of a majority of professionals,” wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData.</p><p>“Some of this is habitual, but a lot is also down to a perception that Home Depot has a superior range, is better at having items in stock, and offers a wider selection of services. Over the quarters ahead, it will be vital for&#xa0;Lowe's to correct some of these perceptions and double down on attracting professionals if it wants to boost growth.”</p><p>Also:Walmart and Home Depot beat earnings expectations but a number of factors are putting a squeeze on the consumer shopping spree</p><p>Wedbush analysts also factor in the impact of lumber prices on DIY projects.</p><p>“The company's updated outlook assumes the home improvement market will moderate given lower levels of commodity inflation and a continued increase in consumer mobility driven by a return to work and school; however, the environment remains fluid with the delta variant trends creating new uncertainty,” analysts said.</p><p>Wedbush rates Lowe's stock neutral with a $210 price target.</p><p>And: Why now might be the best time to buy lumber</p><p>Lowe's stock has gained 6.3% for the week so far, compared with a 2.5% decline for Home Depot.</p><p>Lowe's shares have added 26.2% for the year to date, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, which is up 17.3%.</p>",
