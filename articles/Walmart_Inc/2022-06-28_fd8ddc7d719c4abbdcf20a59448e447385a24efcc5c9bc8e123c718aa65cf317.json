  "title": "Stock-Exchange Startup Gets $100 Million Investment Funded by Walton Family Member; Silicon Valley's Long-Term Stock Exchange gets a check from James Walton, who partnered with a venture fund",
  "text": "<p>The investment comes as traditional venture-capital firms are pumping the brakes on funding startups right now, wary of taking on new risk when the markets and economy appear to be in a tenuous position. Companies are instead having to strike deals at big discounts to their prior funding rounds, cut costs or look to less common investors, such as corporations, to write checks.</p><p>Mr. Walton, the grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton, is a philanthropist and conservationist, a co-leader of the social impact fund Wend Collective. He and The Space Between, the venture fund with which Mr. Walton partnered to provide the funding, started discussions with the exchange months ago.</p><p>The exchange was talking to Mr. Walton, TSB and several other investors about a Series C funding round this winter when the markets \"dropped out on us,\" said LTSE founder and chief executive Eric Ries. Other investors who said they would participate in the funding round backed out, skittish from a stock market roiled by soaring inflation, a war between Russia and Ukraine, and a swift retreat from fast-growing companies, including most tech stocks.</p><p>Mr. Walton and TSB remained present, though, Mr. Ries said, describing near-daily conversations.</p><p>The executives at TSB have experience in the venture world, having invested early in companies such as ride-sharing company Lyft Inc. and Virta Health Corp. They also have longstanding ties to the Silicon Valley stock exchange to which they are writing a big check. The TSB team includes Andy Lam and Tabreez Verjee, formerly of Uprising Ventures, an early investor in LTSE. Other partners are Holly Grant, former chief operating officer at LTSE, and Xue Devand, a board adviser to LTSE.</p><p>The LTSE pitches itself as a new framework for environmental, social and corporate governance investing. Stock exchanges mostly only operate as trading platforms for companies' shares, though they also serve as gatekeepers for corporate governance. There are more than a dozen exchanges in the U.S., though trading and listings are dominated by two: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc. Both exchanges also tout advisory services around ESG.</p><p>Companies that list on the LTSE do so as a secondary listing. They write their own long-term themed commitments, such as aligning executive and board compensation with performance. The commitments are then monitored by the exchange, which essentially gives an ESG stamp of approval.</p><p>Despite the support from Silicon Valley, LTSE struggled at first to persuade companies to list with them. Last year, tech companies Twilio Inc. and Asana Inc. became the first two companies to dual list their shares on the startup exchange. Others are also considering listing their shares, according to people familiar with the matter, including secondhand retailer ThredUp Inc.</p><p>Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com</p><p>Stock-Exchange Startup Gets $100 Million Investment Funded by Walton Family Member</p>",
