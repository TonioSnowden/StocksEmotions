  "title": "U.S. News:  White-Collar Workers Bear Brunt of Recent Layoffs  ----  By Theo Francis and Emily Glazer",
  "text": "<p>   Recent rounds of layoffs at large U.S. companies mark a departure from the usual pattern as executives navigate fears of an economic slowdown: This time, white-collar workers have been among the first and hardest hit. </p><p>   Demand has fallen sharply for professionals in technology, legal, scientific and finance fields, and companies that ramped up staffing during the pandemic, including tech firms, are slowing down hiring or cutting jobs as they shutter some projects or scale back others. </p><p>    Amazon.com Inc. is cutting roughly 3% of its staff, or as many as 10,000 workers, in its retail, devices, human-resourcesand other divisions, but it is leaving largely untouched its hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is concentrating layoffs in its recruiting and business teams as it cuts 13% of its workforce, or about 11,000 people. Layoffs at Ford Motor Co., Walmart Inc. and fast-fashion company H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB are also targeting salaried and office staff, rather than production or retail workers. </p><p>   \"There's a very clear white-collar recession in demand for labor,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job site ZipRecruiter Inc. </p><p>   Based on a survey conducted in October, economists put the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at 63%. The Federal Reserve is seeking to lower the risk by raising interest rates enough to cool inflation without inducing higher unemployment and an economic downturn. </p><p>   \"I don't think we're going to see millions of job losses in any given month,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, a strategy consulting unit of Ernst &amp; Young LLP. \"But we're likely to see more of a slowdown in the jobflow.\" </p><p>   Typically in previous economic downturns, companies in capital-intensive industries -- including mining, manufacturing and construction -- were among the first to lay off workers, followed by those employing armies of lower-wage staff or in highly cyclical businesses like air travel and hospitality, Ms. Pollak said. As a slowdown deepens and recession looms, companies begin to lay off white-collar professionals. </p><p>   Now, the biggest slowdowns in job postings have been in industries dominated by white-collar workers, according to a ZipRecruiter analysis. Since June, when the Federal Reserve accelerated its interest-rate hikes and market concern about a downturn surged, tech job postings have fallen 36%. Those for business services jobs fell 32%, while science and legal jobs are down about 31%. </p><p>   By contrast, advertising for travel jobs has edged up in the same period, while food and retail job ads declined by 4% to 5%. \"Those industries seem quite far away from any kind of contraction,\" Ms. Pollak said. </p><p>   A white-collar slowdown has yet to show up in the most recent federal employment data. Job openings remain plentiful, and economists forecast that Friday's employment report will show a gain of 200,000 jobs in November. </p><p>   Job cuts are up sharply from earlier this year, but through November, 2022 has seen fewer job cuts than almost any year since at least 1993, second only to last year, according to recruiting firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The tech sector, however, has seen more layoffs through November than any year since 2002. </p><p>   One consolation for laid-off professionals, and for the economy: High-skilled employees are more likely to find another job relatively soon, said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan labor economist. \"They may be absorbed into a lower paying job, but I don't think they'll end up being unemployed for long.\" </p><p></p>",
