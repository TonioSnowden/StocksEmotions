  "title": "Asda chief Burnley to step down after £6.8bn private equity buyout",
  "text": "<p>Roger Burnley has said he will step down as chief executive of Asda, just months after the private equity firm TDR Capital and the billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a978525-d0cc-4a14-ba83-63732ee14067\">to buy the UK supermarket group </a>in a £6.8bn deal. </p> <p>Burnley, who has led the grocer since 2018, will stay in the role until next year while its owners recruit a successor, <a href=\"https://corporate.asda.com/newsroom/2021/03/18/asda-leadership-update\">Asda said in a statement</a>. </p> <p>“My decision to leave Asda is personal,” Burnley said. TDR Capital and the Issa brothers “have both a real passion for this great business and great ideas to enhance its continued success”, he said, adding he was “committed to leading this great business for the next year and delivering our strategy”. </p> <p>Asda's new owners plan to run it “over the next five years and beyond”, the statement said. The 54-year-old Burnley has decided he is not the right person to lead the company during that period, according to two people briefed on the matter. </p> <p>The Issa brothers and TDR said Burnley had “protected and enhanced an exceptionally resilient business which we are proud to own”.</p> <p>The brothers, who run the petrol-station business EG Group, previously indicated Burnley would stay on after the deal, which was announced in October and completed last month. They said in February that they were “committed to supporting” Burnley and his team “as they continue to reposition the business to drive long-term growth”. </p> <p>TDR and the brothers have arranged an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79964b33-2406-41c8-8f24-4ff5552f1669\">intricate series of asset disposals and debt deals</a> to fund the bulk of the cost of buying the retailer. They plan to sell its petrol stations to EG Group, while loading Asda with £3.7bn of junk-rated debt. </p> <p>Walmart, which has owned the company since 1999, has kept a minority stake. </p> <p>Sky News first reported Burnley's departure. </p> <p>Asda's sales growth has lagged behind rivals. The supermarket group last month said it planned to make <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c26016cd-45b6-48a5-8e47-320dd90799f3\">5,000 store staff redundant</a> as it shifted toward online grocery orders, hiring 4,500 new workers to staff its online operation. </p> <p>Burnley said at the time that the coronavirus pandemic had “shown us that businesses have to be prepared to adapt quickly to change”. </p><p>Source: Kaye Wiggins in London 2021 'Asda chief Burnley to step down after £6.8bn private equity buyout' FT.com 18 March.
