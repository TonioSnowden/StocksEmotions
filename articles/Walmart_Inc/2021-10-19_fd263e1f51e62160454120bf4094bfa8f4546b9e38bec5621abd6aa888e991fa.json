The American Rescue Plan \"is projected to cause a transitory increase in the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, which translates into a core inflation rate that is about 0.3 percentage point higher per year through 2022,\" bank analysts wrote in the report. \"The impact of the ARP on inflation rests on the transitory nature of the fiscal spending increase, but also on the stability of longer-run inflation expectations,\" they added. Inflation has surged well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target over recent months, which Fed officials have attributed to supply driven shocks they believe will ease as the coronavirus pandemic wanes.</p><p>â€”By Michael S.
