  "title": "Republicans Step Into Amy Klobuchar's Antitrust Trap; Her bill won't end Big Tech's censorship of conservative views, but it would crush American businesses.",
  "text": "<p>One of the bill's Republican co-sponsors, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana—echoing Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla of California and Chris Coons of Delaware—said before Thursday's committee vote that the bill would need serious revisions or he wouldn't support bringing it to floor. Mr. Kennedy, like many Republicans, saw the trap for conservatives that Ms. Klobuchar is setting—and stepped into it anyway. With the hope of curbing Big Tech's heavy-handed \"content moderation\" censorship of conservatives, many Republicans still are supporting this badly written bill, which promises chaos for markets, disruption for consumers, and socialism for American business.</p><p>Even Democrats on the committee expressed discomfort that the bill had no hearing in the committee, which would have allowed expert witnesses to explain how it is a Pandora's box. If a full hearing had been held, Republicans would have learned that this bill wouldn't protect conservative speech online. In fact, it would make woke censorship much worse. Ms. Klobuchar's bill would subject tech companies to fines of up to 15% of their annual revenue—the most severe fines ever—for vaguely defined offenses disconnected to any specified harm. With Silicon Valley executives subject to draconian penalties, they would have to look constantly to regulators to know how high to jump. One obvious way to avoid the chopping block of progressive regulators like Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan would be to become more woke than ever before.</p><p>This bill would also mandate tech stagnation by adopting severe innovation-killing restrictions and regulations like those of the European Union. Ms. Klobuchar's bill would outlaw \"self-preferencing,\" essentially turning Big Tech companies into public utilities. Google couldn't give preference to Google Maps. The bill's language makes it possible for a company to claim it was harmed if it comes up second in a search on any platform. These companies also would be forbidden from preloading their apps on the smartphones they produce. Amazon says the bill would \"degrade the benefits of Amazon Prime that customers love.\" These companies would have to reject the small businesses that market and sell products through them or risk losing trillions of dollars in equity while ending services consumers like.</p><p>But wait, as American inventor Ron Popeil used to say, there's more! Mrs. Feinstein called the possibility that the bill could disadvantage American tech companies \"very dangerous.\" Its passage would be a security nightmare for American consumers and a victory for China. The bill's interoperability mandate would grant competitors, including Chinese companies beholden to the Communist Party, free and total access to the proprietary hardware, software, systems, platforms and infrastructure of companies like Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>It would also require that these U.S. companies share their data with competitors. If you think the amount of personal data held by Big Tech is concerning, imagine the consequences of requiring large tech companies to share your personal data with Chinese competitors. If enacted, Ms. Klobuchar's bill would cause a massive government-mandated data breach. An attempt to amend the bill in committee did not solve the problem</p><p>Proponents of this bill claim it targets only Big Tech firms with huge subscriber bases and levels of equity, but companies with heavy digital traffic from consumers and subscribers are likely to grow into the crosshairs of this bill, ranging from grocers and retailers like Walmart and Publix, to Visa, IBM, AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Netflix. They would be subject to all the punitive provisions being marketed by Ms. Klobuchar as only being aimed at Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.</p><p>Worst of all, the bill would make the Federal Trade Commission a superagency by expanding its budget by $300 million along with the almost unlimited power to persecute American business with its vast menu of potential offenses. At some point, overregulation becomes ownership. Ms. Klobuchar's bill ultimately would effectively give the FTC chairman a virtual seat on the board of every major U.S. company.</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who said he is \"committed to stopping Big Tech's manifestly anticompetitive, unjust and abusive behavior,\" offered a sobering question to his Republican colleagues about this bill. \"What do we gain by giving deep-state bureaucrats control over Big Tech?\" he asked before voting against sending the bill to the Senate floor. \"They don't want to break up Big Tech to protect us, but to control it and use it against us. We can't hand the keys to Big Tech over to radical ideologues more concerned with power and control than they are with prosperity and economic freedom.\"</p><p>Censorship of conservatives by Big Tech companies can be addressed by requiring companies that enjoy the liability protections of Section 230 to give consumers procedural and legal redress against censorship. When it comes to antitrust, the Senate would do well to remember the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm.</p><p>Mr. Bork is president of the Antitrust Education Project.</p><p>Republicans Step Into Amy Klobuchar's Antitrust Trap</p>",
