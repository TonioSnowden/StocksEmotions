  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Walmart Drops Mask Rules  For Vaccinated Workers  ----  By Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   Walmart Inc. said Friday that vaccinated workers don't need to wear masks while on the job and it would end a special sick-pay program for Covid-19 illnesses, changing its policies after several states lifted indoor mask mandates. </p><p>   The retail giant, which has about 1.6 million U.S. workers, previously required all U.S. staff to wear masks and requested shoppers wear masks in localities that required them. </p><p>   In a memo to staff, Walmart said it would stop offering paid Covid-19-related sick leave next month, except when required by local governments. The policy gave hourly workers extra paid time off for Covid-19 illnesses, exposures or Covid-like symptoms, beyond their standard sick-leave pay. </p><p>   It also will drop a daily health screening given to workers when they start a shift in all areas except a handful of states that require it. Unvaccinated workers must still wear masks, the memo said. </p><p>   Walmart was one of the first big private employers to adopt a mask requirement in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic emerged. Walmart eased its mask requirements for vaccinated workers and shoppers in May 2021, but then reimposed the rule for some workers last July when the Delta variant caused a jump in infections. </p><p></p>",
