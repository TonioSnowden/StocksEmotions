  "text": "<p>Top News</p><p>Powell: Bottlenecks Could Lead to Longer Interval of High Inflation</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that a recent spell of higher inflation might last longer than central bank officials had anticipated, but he repeated his expectation that the price surge should eventually fade.</p><p>\"The current inflation spike is really a consequence of supply constraints meeting very strong demand.

On Wednesday, the facility took in $1.416 trillion from money-market funds and other eligible firms, compared with negibile levels of activity in spring. Many firms like to buttress holdings however they can at month end, and for some parking cash with the Fed is a good way to do that, so it is likely inflows could be even larger on Thursday, the last day of September and the third quarter.</p><p>—Michael S.
