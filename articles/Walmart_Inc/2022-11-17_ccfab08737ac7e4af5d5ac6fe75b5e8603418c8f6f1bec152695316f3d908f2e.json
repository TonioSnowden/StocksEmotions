  "text": "<p>But it added: \"Given the macro uncertainty, we will not reiterate or update our guidance through fiscal-year 2024.\" Executives said they would offer a financial outlook for 2023 and beyond in its fourth-quarter earnings release.</p><p>The outlook was more downcast than the one executives gave in August, when they cited \"strong performance\" through the first half of the year and touted the company's digital strategy. At that time, management said they hoped to boost sales to $10 billion by fiscal 2024.</p><p>Shares tumbled 8.9% in after-hours trading Thursday.</p><p>For its third quarter, Williams-Sonoma's WSM results were a mixed bag. The company reported net income of $251.7 million, or $3.72 a share, compared with $249.5 million, or $3.29 a share in the same quarter last year.</p><p>Revenue was $2.19 billion, compared with $2.05 billion in the prior-year quarter. Same-store sales rose 8.1%. The company reported gross margin of 41.5%, a decrease from a year ago, weighed down in part by higher freight costs.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to earn $3.73 a share on revenue of $2.15 billion, with a same-store sales gain of 6.6%.</p><p>The results and the stock action add to a mixed response from investors this week.</p><p>Wall Street has tried to gauge consumer demand amid still-elevated prices, and retailers' preparedness for the holidays, as inflation reshapes what shoppers buy and leaves retailers overhauling inventories in response. Shares of Ross Stores Inc. ROST jumped after it reported results on Thursday. So didshares of Walmart Inc. WMT. Target Corp. TGT, however, fell, after the chain warned of weaker sales trends up ahead.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma stock is down 23% year-to-date, while the S&amp;P 500 Index SPX has fallen 17% this year.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma warns of 'macro uncertainty' in outlook, stock falls</p>",
