  "text": "<p>   Several family members behind retailing giant Walmart Inc. said Tuesday they are helping launch a new art and music festival in their hometown of Bentonville, Ark., in a bid to turn the city into a cultural destination. </p><p>   The event, inspired by Texas's Austin City Limits Festival, is called FORMAT (For Music + Art + Technology) and will take place the weekend of Sept. 23. Performances will include bands such as Rufus Du Sol, Phoenix, The Flaming Lips and The War on Drugs alongside art performances and immersive pieces by visual artists, including Nick Cave, Pia Camil and Jacolby Satterwhite. </p><p>   The event offers a glimpse into the cultural ambitions of the next generation of Walmart heirs. Alice Walton, the daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, has long been known in art circles as a major collector who opened Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville 11 years ago. But the festival is being spearheaded by two of her nephews, Steuart and Tom Walton, and the latter's wife, Olivia Walton. </p><p>   The younger Waltons are outdoorsy types who like to hike and ride bike trails. The brothers are also pilots and run a flight school as well as oversee real-estate ventures in the city. Olivia, a New Yorker and former NBC News reporter, moved to Arkansas soon after she and Tom married in 2016. Together, they are teaming up on FORMAT with a creative firm called Triadic as well as with C3 Presents, the concert promoter behind Chicago's Lollapalooza. </p><p>   Olivia Walton, 37 years old, who recently took over as Crystal Bridges's chairwoman, said the festival got its start two years ago during the pandemic when Triadic pitched the concept to her and her husband, who is 38, and the couple realized how much they missed watching live music. They also saw a festival as a way to invest in the region's creative economies beyond Crystal Bridges. </p><p>   \"If you love a museum, you go a couple times a year, but if you love a band, you'd go see them play a couple times a month if you could,\" Ms. Walton said. </p><p>   The festival aims to start small, with an audience of up to 17,000 people in their 30s and 40s, rather than the 80,000-plus crowds of mostly college students who typically attend festivals such as Tennessee's Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, organizers said. Tickets will start at $275, and 400 camping sites will also be available to stake. </p><p>   Tom Walton, who collects contemporary art with his wife and brother, said he is a big fan of music festivals. To build on his aunt's artistic legacy, it is equally important that the visual arts enjoy equal billing with the rock bands, he said. \"The idea that art has to be in a museum is something we're trying to get away from,\" he said. </p><p>   To kick off festivities in September, artist Doug Aitken will land his mirrored hot-air balloon on the festival grounds, a 300-acre field surrounded by woods owned by the Waltons. Dotting the field will be stages and immersive spaces designed by artists such as Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman. </p><p></p>",
