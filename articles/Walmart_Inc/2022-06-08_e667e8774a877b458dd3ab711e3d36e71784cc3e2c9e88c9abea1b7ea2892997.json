  "title": "Target CEO Says Unloading Excess Inventory Is a Necessary Pain; Brian Cornell's decision to shed excess goods quickly is the latest abrupt strategy shift for the CEO",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Cornell, who joined Target as CEO in 2014, surprised some investors on Tuesday when he said the retailer would report lower profits this quarter because it will move to quickly shed excess inventory due to shifting buying patterns. The news came less than three weeks after Target reported lower-than-expected profits, in part due to the cost of managing bloated inventory. Now the company will quickly cancel orders or sell products at a discount during the current quarter, eating further into profits, Mr. Cornell said.</p><p>Other retailers with too much inventory on hand—including Walmart Inc., Macy's Inc. and Gap Inc.—have said they would discount some items and hold on to others to sell at a seasonally appropriate moment.</p><p>\"We have to be decisive and get out in front of this to make sure this doesn't linger through the back half of the year,\" Mr. Cornell said in an interview earlier this week. Target's stock sank 7% when the market opened Tuesday, then recovered some value throughout the day, eventually closing down 2.3%.</p><p>During its annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, Target executives were asked why the company cut profit forecasts so quickly after its earnings announcement.</p><p>\"While we've continued to see strong traffic and sales growth since we reported our first quarter results we've watched as many competitors have reported elevated inventory levels,\" said Michael Fiddelke, Target's chief financial officer. \"As such we announced yesterday that we are taking a number of actions to further right-size our inventory.\"</p><p>Target shares rose slightly on Wednesday to close at $156.70.</p><p>Target's announcement isn't out of character for Mr. Cornell. The 63-year-old executive joined Target after leadership stints at PepsiCo Inc. and Sam's Club. When Mr. Cornell took the helm at Target, the retailer had struggled with a long streak of weak sales, in part due to a data breach that eroded trust with some shoppers.</p><p>Mr. Cornell soon decided the company should exit all stores in Canada, scrapping an international expansion that had already cost it $4 billion. That strategy differed from some competitors such as Walmart and Costco Wholesale Corp., which had already opened stores in multiple countries outside the U.S. Target, Mr. Cornell said, would narrow its focus on the U.S., where it would concentrate on a handful of categories such as baby, fashion and e-commerce.</p><p>\"This difficult decision in Canada allows us to focus all of our energy on strengthening and executing our plans in the U.S.,\" Mr. Cornell said on a conference call at the time. Target's shares closed 1.8% higher that day.</p><p>Sales improved in some quarters, though overall the chain still lagged behind some peers. Among the problems, Mr. Cornell determined: Prices were too high, and stores needed remodels.</p><p>So in February 2017, on the day Target announced weak holiday sales, Mr. Cornell outlined a comeback plan for the U.S. business at an analyst meeting in New York. Target, he said, would spend billions of dollars to refurbish stores, use stores as e-commerce hubs, introduce better store brands and cut prices.</p><p>Target's stock fell 12%, at the time its biggest one-day drop since 2008.</p><p>\"It was hard to climb those stairs and stand in front of that audience looking at me wondering why we made this decision,\" Mr. Cornell said of that day in a 2019 interview.</p><p>The plan largely worked, then got a big boost from Covid-19. Comparable sales, those from stores or digital channels operating for at least 12 months, have increased each year since. After the pandemic hit, sales rose 19.3% in the fiscal year that ended in January 2021, and rose 12.7% in the next fiscal year, which ended this past January. Shoppers flocked to new services Target began offering, to buy online and pick up in store parking lots or receive home delivery. Customers bought more furniture, outdoor gear and food to cook at home than before the pandemic. Target added over $25 billion to annual revenue over two years of the pandemic.</p><p>Now Mr. Cornell is facing a new high-wire act as consumer trends shift again.</p><p>\"We've had some additional time after earnings to really evaluate the overall operating environment,\" said Mr. Cornell in an interview earlier this week. He said that includes watching consumers' behavior as they face high rates of inflation, and seeing many other retailers talk about high inventory levels during their earnings presentations.</p><p>Shoppers aren't buying as many pandemic favorites such as patio furniture and small kitchen appliances, instead spending on food and entertainment. Some items arrived late after shipping delays, Mr. Cornell said. \"Now that it is here, the demand signal has changed.\"</p><p>\"Target's long-term strategy remains the same,\" a spokesman said. \"The announcement we made yesterday was about addressing obstacles in the near-term.\"</p><p>After Tuesday's profit warning, some investors expressed shock. \"To cut this year's profitability expectation so meaningfully back to back like this is quite jarring for a business that is supposed to be relatively predictable,\" said John San Marco, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, which has a 0.14% stake in Target, according to FactSet.</p><p>Target did extremely well during the pandemic, he said. \"It's not clear why they are sort of facing disproportionate pain right now when the consumer environment just became choppy,\" he said. Target's core strategy—serving shoppers in stores and digitally with a curated assortment—still makes sense long term, he said.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Target CEO Says Unloading Excess Inventory Is a Necessary Pain</p>",
