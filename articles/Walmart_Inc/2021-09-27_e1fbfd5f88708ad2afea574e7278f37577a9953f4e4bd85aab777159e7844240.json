  "text": "<p>\"When companies are looking ahead to peak season. . .the word I'm hearing most often is 'terrified,'\" said Dan Johnston, chief executive and co-founder of WorkStep, a startup whose software helps companies hire and retain supply-chain workers.</p><p>Workers to fill online orders and push merchandise out to stores are in short supply in a tight U.S. labor market in which service industries say the lack of available staff is hampering their recovery efforts.</p><p>\"There is a huge amount of demand for jobs and people, and we have not shifted people across into our industry at the rate that demand has changed,\" said Kraig Foreman, president of e-commerce for DHL Supply Chain North America, a unit of Deutsche Post AG whose contract logistics customers include running-shoe maker Brooks Sports Inc. and Italian candy giant Ferrero International SA.</p><p>DHL Supply Chain aims to hire 12,000 seasonal workers in North America for this year's holiday peak, a 20% increase from 2020. The company is raising pay and adding hundreds more collaborative robots that navigate warehouses to help workers pick orders.</p><p>Demand for distribution workers skyrocketed as more consumers shop online, in part because picking, packing and shipping e-commerce orders is more labor-intensive than traditional warehouse operations that distribute wholesale goods or replenish store inventory.</p><p>The pandemic accelerated e-commerce adoption as homebound consumers loaded up digital shopping carts. Covid-19 also deepened pressure on blue-collar labor ranks, with some people leaving the workforce because of concerns about getting sick or to care for family members.</p><p>Big retailers who once devoted seasonal hiring to store workers are bringing in more workers to logistics operations geared toward online demand. Walmart plans to hire 20,000 workers for its supply chain operations ahead of the holidays. Target Corp. plans to hire 100,000 seasonal staffers this year, about 30,000 fewer than last year's goal, but the retailer said it tripled the number of store-fulfillment workers over the past two years.</p><p>The push for workers is driving sharp increases in pay. Wages for e-commerce workers have jumped to as much as $19 an hour from between $13 to $15 an hour in recent years in some markets, logistics executives said.</p><p>Starting pay for Amazon warehouse workers is up to $22 an hour in some locations, the company said, while the average hourly wage for supply-chain workers at rival Walmart is now $20.37.</p><p>The tight labor market added $450 million to FedEx Corp.'s costs in the most recent quarter, the delivery giant said last week, with those headwinds expected to persist through the end of the year.</p><p>The staffing crunch is accelerating automation across largely manual warehousing and fulfillment operations.</p>",
