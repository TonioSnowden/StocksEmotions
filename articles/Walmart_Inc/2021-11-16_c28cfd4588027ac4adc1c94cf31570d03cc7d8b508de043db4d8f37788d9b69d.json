  "title": "Global brands' use of ‘virgin' plastics on track for significant drop by 2025",
  "text": "<p>The use of brand new “virgin” plastics by some of the world's largest brands has peaked and is on track to fall significantly by 2025 as the use of recycled packaging grows.</p> <p>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which promotes a “circular economy” to cut waste and emissions, said data from multinational companies including Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever showed their total use of virgin plastics had fallen for the second year running in 2020.</p> <p>The 63 consumer goods groups and retailers involved in the project are set to cut their use of non-recycled plastics by almost a fifth by 2025 overall, compared with 2018 levels, said the foundation. It collects annual data from organisations that signed a global commitment to cut plastic waste led by the foundation and UN Environment Programme.</p> <p>This will save 8m tonnes of virgin plastics from being produced annually by 2025, equivalent to 40m barrels of oil remaining in the ground, the foundation said.</p> <p>About a fifth of the world's plastic packaging is used by consumer goods makers and retailers such as Walmart that signed the commitment, which includes targets for plastic use. Packaging providers can also sign up.</p> <p>Sander Defruyt, who leads the foundation's New Plastics Economy initiative, said he expected that companies outside the group would continue increasing their use of virgin plastics. But he said the peak among those taking part was a key moment.</p> <p>“It's a very significant milestone. If you put it in a historical perspective, virgin plastic use for this industry has been going up quite rapidly for decades . . . Some of the largest brands and retailers in the world are showing it can be done and showing that business growth can be decoupled from virgin plastic use,” he said.</p> <p>Unilever, for example, which makes Dove soap and Domestos bleach, increased recycled content to 11 per cent of its plastic packaging in 2020, up from 5 per cent a year earlier, and said it was “well on track” to reach its 25 per cent target by 2025.</p> <p>Others lagged behind: Mars reported using no recycled plastic packaging in 2020, despite a target of 30 per cent by 2025. It said it was especially hard to incorporate recycled plastic into the flexible packaging it uses for many products, but that it had trial schemes under way.</p> <p>Defruyt said progress on recycling in the industry was not being matched by work to eliminate the need for single-use plastic by creating reuse and refill schemes, which require much bigger changes to business models.</p> <p>These are essential to reversing climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, he added. “We can't recycle our way out of this,” he said.</p> <p>The foundation is calling for a global agreement on plastic pollution to push forward regulation and investment. It hopes a February meeting of the UN Environment Assembly will take steps towards a deal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/384d2502-3857-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\">Nestlé</a> said it was piloting bulk deliveries, packaging-free drinks dispensers and reusable packaging. It also said it supported a global treaty on plastics.</p> <p>Challenges include the fact that “for reuse systems to be adopted at a larger scale, reuse collection bins need to be made widely available as is the case with recycling bins”, it said.</p> <p>PepsiCo, which also backs a treaty, said its SodaStream fizzy drink machines, which avoid single-use plastic bottles, were available in more than 40 countries.</p> <p><em>This story has been updated to say that 63 consumer goods groups and retailers are involved in the project, rather than 65 and that for Unilever recycled content was 5 per cent of its plastic packaging in 2019, not 1 per cent</em></p><p>Source: Judith Evans 2021 'Global brands' use of ‘virgin' plastics on track for significant drop by 2025' FT.com 16 November.
