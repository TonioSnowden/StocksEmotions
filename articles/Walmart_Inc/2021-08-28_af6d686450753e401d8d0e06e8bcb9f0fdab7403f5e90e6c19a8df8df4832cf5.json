  "text": "<p>\n  I hope that when they have kids, they take them to the distant corners of this fascinating world. And I hope my grandchildren taunt their parents into eating something called splendid balls (a delicious Uzbek dumpling filled with beef, onion, olive and apricot) off a menu in Samarkand, because it isn't a serious dining dare if you know what you're biting into. Horse. Scorpion. Giraffe. Splendid balls. Memories. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ms. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.

These tricks we've learned (sometimes painfully) might open a new chapter of fun for you and your children. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Test the waters first. Taking kids under 5 on a tour of Rome is a waste of time and money. Start getting your travel mojo back with a road trip or short jaunt. Hitting Colonial Williamsburg or driving up the Pacific Coast Highway is a relatively easy way to gain a sense of rhythm -- and understanding of just how much cultural immersion your family will tolerate. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Choose destinations that resonate. Tying big trips to what school-age kids are learning will bring their classrooms to life. Have the children help pick a place they'll be studying, then visit local museums and watch relevant movies to give everyone some baseline knowledge. Warning: Cities aren't always ideal, as they require lots of walking. Consider Crete, Oaxaca, Oman, Taiwan. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Don't pack too much in. Accept that you won't see everything on one retreat. A decent cadence is to have breakfast at the hotel, do one exciting activity in the morning, hang by the pool or somewhere else refreshing in the afternoon and make evenings an adventure. And when you visit a museum, pick two highlights, then get out. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Gamify whatever you can. The Walmart Challenge (set a low amount to spend; have parents judge who scores the best item) works almost anywhere. Finding a ridiculous phrase each day that everyone has to work into casual conversation can animate bored kids. Start a collection. Try your own dining dares. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Break some rules. Serendipity makes travel exhilarating. So don't worry if breakfast comes from a street cart or bedtime is late. And order room service! Kids won't remember the brutal 4 a.m. layover, but they will cherish an evening of burgers in robes. </p><p>\n  -- Heidi Mitchell </p><p></p>",
