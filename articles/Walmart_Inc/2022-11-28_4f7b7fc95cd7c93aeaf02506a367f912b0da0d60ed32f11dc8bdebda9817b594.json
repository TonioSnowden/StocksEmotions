  "title": "U.S. News:  Employers Rethink Need for a Degree  ----  By Austen Hufford",
  "text": "<p>   The tight labor market is prompting more employers to eliminate one of the biggest requirements for many higher-paying jobs: the need for a college degree. </p><p>   Companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Delta Air Lines Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. have reduced educational requirements for certain positions and shifted hiring to focus more on skills and experience. Maryland this year cut college-degree requirements for many state jobs -- leading to a surge in hiring -- and incoming Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned on a similar initiative. </p><p>   U.S. job postings requiring at least a bachelor's degree were 41% in November, down from 46% at the start of 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the future of work. Degree requirements dropped even more early in the pandemic. They have grown since then but remain below prepandemic levels. </p><p>   The shift comes as demand for workers remains high and unemployment is low. Job postings far outpace the number of unemployed people looking for work -- 10.7 million openings in September compared with 5.8 million unemployed -- creating unusually stiff competition for workers. </p><p>   The persistently tight labor market has accelerated the trend that builds on a debate about the benefits and drawbacks of encouraging more people to attend four-year colleges and as organizations try to address racial disparities in the workplace. </p><p>   Some occupations have universal degree requirements, such as doctors and engineers, while others typically have no higher education requirements, such as retail workers. There is a middle ground, such as tech positions, that have varying degree requirements depending on the industry, company and strength of the labor market and economy. </p><p>   Lucy Mathis won a scholarship to attend a women in computer science conference. There, she learned about an IT internship at Google and eventually dropped out of her computer science undergraduate program to work at the company full time. The 28-year-old now makes a six-figure sum as a systems specialist. </p><p>   \"I found out I had a knack for IT,\" she said. \"I'm not good at academics. It's not for me.\" </p><p>   More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have completed Google's online college-alternative program that offers training in fast-growing fields such as digital marketing and project management, the company said. It and 150 other companies are now using the program to hire entry-level workers. </p><p>   The majority of its U.S. roles at IBM no longer require a four-year degree after the company conducted a review of hiring practices, spokeswoman Ashley Bright said. </p><p>   Delta eased its educational requirements for pilots at the start of this year, saying a four-year college degree was preferred but no longer required of job applicants. </p><p>    Walmart Inc., the country's largest private employer, said it values skills and knowledge gained through work experience and that 75% of its U.S. salaried store management started their careers in hourly jobs. </p><p>   \"We don't require degrees for most of our jobs in the field and increasingly in the home office as well,\" Kathleen McLaughlin, Walmart executive vice president, said at an online event this fall. </p><p>   A four-year college degree holder has more lifetime earnings than one without. The lifetime earnings of a worker with a high-school diploma is $1.6 million while that of a bachelor's degree holder is $2.8 million, according to a 2021 report by the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University. </p><p>   But many people don't finish college and are left with mountains of debt -- more than 43 million people in the U.S. hold a total of $1.6 trillion in student-loan debt. While a college degree can provide specific workplace skills, workers can gain the skills needed for many jobs without a four-year degree. </p><p>   Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan in March said the government would review college-degree requirements for every state job. State and local governments have struggled to hire workers in the tight labor market. </p><p>   Half a year later, Maryland said the program is showing early signs of working as intended. The number of state employees hired without a four-year degree from May to August is up 41% from a year before while the number of all employees hired is up 14%. </p><p></p>",
