Revenue for the three months through December stood at $1.3 billion, up 34% from the same quarter in 2020.</p><p>The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash as consumers grew more accustomed to the ease and convenience of ordering meals and groceries through apps. To capitalize on the shift, DoorDash expanded its offerings to deliver everything from groceries to alcohol and pet food. It also expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed directly on the websites retailers including Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc.</p><p>The continued strength of food-delivery and its expansion into new segments led DoorDash to forecast the total value of orders on its platform to grow to as much as $50 billion in 2022, from about $42 billion in 2021.
