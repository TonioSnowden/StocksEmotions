  "text": "<p>The boss of J Sainsbury said there would be less choice of some product lines over Christmas and refused to rule out rising prices in the new year as retailers face inflationary pressure and supply chain problems.</p> <p>Simon Roberts, chief executive of the UK's second-largest supermarket, said the group would use its scale, supplier relationships and cost-saving programme to keep availability strong and minimise the effect of inflation.</p> <p>The issues are particularly acute in the group's Argos general merchandise chain, which has significant market share in areas such as toys and consumer electronics.</p> <p>Its sales in the first half were down 7.3 per cent year on year in the 28 weeks to September 18, “impacted by supply challenges, unseasonal weather and lower demand for home office equipment and technology in the second quarter”.</p> <p>Roberts said shipping times from Asia, normally about 25 days, had extended to “north of 40 days” on occasions. An annual pre-Christmas promotion on toys had been delayed by two weeks as a result.</p> <p>“We forward bought a lot of container capacity so we're confident we'll get everything through that we planned for, but there are some challenges,” he added.</p> <p>In consumer electronics particularly, “there will be less stock available than would normally be the case”, mostly because of the chip shortages.</p> <p>“That's well understood, I think customers are hearing that and shopping early,” he added.</p> <p>Currys, the UK market leader in electronics, also acknowledged the problems in a first-half trading update. It said it had “put in place measures to mitigate the well-publicised supply chain disruption caused by industry-wide availability challenges and labour shortages” and left its full-year profit guidance unchanged. </p> <p>In Sainsbury's grocery operation, where a shortage of lorry drivers in the UK had made distribution more challenging, Roberts said the picture was improving.</p> <p>“We've done a lot of work through the back of the summer . . . over the last six to eight weeks we've seen improved availability in a number of areas and we've stabilised where it was more difficult.” </p> <p>Grocery sales in the first half rose 0.8 per cent compared with a period last year when demand was high because of the UK's first national lockdown. Against the equivalent period before the pandemic, sales were up 9.1 per cent. </p> <p>British Retail Consortium figures show food price inflation inching up to 0.5 per cent overall in October. Roberts said that while he was unable to predict the trajectory of food prices into the new year, the company was committed to keeping price rises to a minimum.</p> <p>Since taking over as chief, Roberts has made improving Sainsbury's pricing a priority, especially on “centre of plate” lines such as meat, fish and poultry, where it was perceived as expensive compared with rivals. </p> <p>Underlying group pre-tax profit was £371m, up from £301m last year and £238m the year before as costs fell, while the interim dividend was 3.2p a share.</p> <p>Sainsbury's continued to expect underlying pre-tax profit of at least £660m in the year to March 2022. It is committed to cutting net debt by at least £950m by March 2023 and generating average retail free cash flow of at least £500m a year over the three years to March 2025. &#xa0;</p> <p>Shares in the group, often touted as a takeover target after rivals Wm Morrison and Asda were acquired by private equity groups this year, were down 3.5 per cent in mid-morning trade on Thursday.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Sainsbury's warns of reduced product choice as supply constraints hit Argos' FT.com 4 November.
