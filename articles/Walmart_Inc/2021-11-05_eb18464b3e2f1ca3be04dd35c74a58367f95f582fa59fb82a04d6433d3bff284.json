  "text": "<p>The release, which was posted to Kroger's investor relations' page, was taken down. The spokeswoman said releases from PR Newswire, a platform for distributing announcements for media outlets to see, automatically feed to the press-release section on Kroger's website.</p><p>PR Newswire didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>This isn't the first time a fraudulent news release has been put out on behalf of a major retailer saying some type of cryptocurrency would be accepted as payment. Shares of little-used cryptocurrency litecoin surged in mid-September after a fake news release that was purportedly from Walmart Inc. said customers could use the cryptocurrency as payment.</p><p>Shares of Kroger were down 2% in morning trading. The price of Bitcoin Cash briefly topped $630 Friday morning on the fake press release but fell shortly after, according to CoinDesk.</p><p>Bitcoin Cash,an offshoot of bitcoin, was developed with the idea of fixing problems that were keeping bitcoin from becoming a mainstream way to pay for things. Its underlying technology is similar to bitcoin, but changes were made to Bitcoin Cash to try to make transactions faster and with lower fees.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>Kroger Says News Release on Grocer Accepting Bitcoin Cash Is Fraudulent</p>",
