  "text": "<p>\"This type of fraud really skyrocketed with Covid-19,\" said Dajana Gajic-Fisic, who heads e-commerce risk operations for Finish Line Inc. and the U.S. arm of JD Sports, sellers of athletic shoes and apparel. Both companies are owned by JD Sports PLC. \"There were a lot of people with a lot of time on their hands, and they researched how to do this,\" Ms. Gajic-Fisic said.</p><p>Here is how it works. A consumer places an online order with a retailer. After the package arrives, the consumer -- or the professional refunder the consumer hired -- calls the retailer's customer-service department and says they didn't get the package.</p><p>Professional swindlers research the return policies of individual retailers and know the loopholes, said Karisse Hendrick, founder of fraud-prevention company Chargelytics Consulting. \"They game the system through trial and error,\" she said. \"Sometimes they'll use an insider who has worked in customer service for a particular retailer.\"</p><p>Many retailers will simply issue a refund, particularly if the items are under $500, Ms. Hendrick said.</p><p>Proving a package was delivered to the correct address is difficult, particularly since some carriers stopped requiring customers to sign for deliveries during the pandemic. Even when signatures are used, they often aren't that helpful. \"People just scribble something, and it's hard to know what it says,\" Ms. Gajic-Fisic said.</p><p>When signatures are required, professional swindlers instruct consumers to use fake names, Ms. Hendrick said.</p><p>A FedEx Corp. spokeswoman said the company investigates criminal activity and cooperates with authorities. A United Parcel Service Inc. spokesman said the company uses a range of tools, including software that determines vehicle location at the drop-off point, to crack down on fraud. He said with the rise in e-commerce, there has been an uptick in these types of scams.</p><p>Amazon drivers now take pictures of packages when they drop them off, which makes it harder to claim non-receipt. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\"Fraud is a problem for all retailers that costs the overall U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars each year,\" said Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove. A Target spokeswoman, Kayla Castaneda, said the company's cyber-fraud team is aware of attempts to take advantage of the returns process and puts protections in place to detect and stop it. Both companies said they work with outside partners, including law enforcement and the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, to combat fraud.</p><p>Forter Ltd., which provides fraud-prevention technology to retailers, said some clients reported a 33% jump in \"item not received\" abuse over the past 12 months.</p><p>The uptick presents unique challenges for retailers. The chains can't afford to chase away legitimate customers with restrictive return policies. But they need to crack down on the scams, which can be three times as costly as credit-card fraud, Ms. Hendrick said. One reason return fraud is more costly is that it is newer and there is less technology to prevent it, she said.</p><p>It can be hard to separate legitimate returns from fraudulent ones.</p><p>Some retailers, including Finish Line and Under Armour Inc., now require customers to fill out an affidavit when items don't arrive. The form asks questions such as whether customers checked with their neighbors to ensure the package wasn't mistakenly dropped off at the wrong address. The goal is to slow down the refund process and deter bad actors, the retailers said.</p><p>Finish Line and Under Armour don't call the forms affidavits to customers, to avoid scaring them off. At Finish Line, it is a return refund form and at Under Armour it is called certification of nondelivery.</p><p>\"Certification of nondelivery is less harsh,\" Christina Jordano, Under Armour's digital fraud manager, said recently on an industry panel to discuss the problem. She said the company was concerned that calling it an affidavit wouldn't be customer-friendly.</p><p>Some chains are considering going a step further, by having customers fill out a police report for missing items. But that isn't a fail-safe either.</p><p>\"The problem with police reports is that police departments have different reports, and it's difficult to validate that they are legitimate and not something customers created themselves,\" Ms. Gajic-Fisic said.</p><p>The number of professional refunders offering their services has grown so much that the competition is driving down prices. Going rates now run about 7% to 20% of the value of an order, down from 15% to 30%, Ms. Hendrick said.</p><p>\"It's gotten very competitive,\" she said. \"Some people are making $20,000 a day doing this.\"</p>",
