  "title": "Business News:  Mental-Health Counseling  Comes to Retail Locations  ----  By Sharon Terlep",
  "text": "<p>\n   CVS Health Corp. is betting Americans will get therapy at the same place they buy their snacks, soda and prescription drugs. </p><p>\n  The pharmacy company is among several retailers, including Walmart Inc. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., that are experimenting with offering counseling services in or near stores. They see potential as the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted more people to seek help for addiction, depression and other issues, according to federal data. </p><p>\n  \"It's creative and we certainly need the help,\" said Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \"It's an interesting idea to post a mental-health resource at a place where people already are at.\" </p><p>\n  CVS earlier this year started stationing mental-health providers, typically a licensed clinical social worker trained in cognitive behavioral therapy, at 13 locations in Houston, Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla., as a pilot program. The company said it saw a surprisingly high return rate for customers who had an initial consultation, and is now expanding the program to 34 locations in those areas. </p><p>\n  Some healthcare providers question how many people are comfortable seeking therapy in such a public setting, despite a growing acceptance and understanding of mental-health issues. CVS says other customers would have no way of knowing that a person is getting mental-health help, given that the stores offer a range of wellness services. Mental-health services are advertised inside the stores, where an area designated for medical services includes a private room for counseling sessions. </p><p>\n  \"We're not putting up a big neon sign: 'Getting therapy here,' \" said Cara McNulty, president of behavioral health for CVS-owned Aetna Inc. </p><p>\n  A mental-health assessment costs $129; a 30-minute counseling session is $69. Based on the assessment results, a customer could return for a few therapy sessions, or they might get a referral for extensive services from a family doctor, psychiatrist or another local resource. People without insurance are referred to a community organization that helps the uninsured, CVS said. </p><p>\n  \"We're dealing with a system that is broken and confusing,\" said Aetna's Ms. McNulty. \"Often people don't know where to go, who to see and what they need to be seen for. When you really democratize access to care by putting mental-health support in a retail setting, it makes access easier for people.\" </p><p>\n  Retail pharmacies have been pushing deeper into healthcare to offset rising competition from online retailers and slower profit growth from prescription drugs. At the same time, more for-profit companies are looking to upend traditional mental-health models. Last year, there was a record level of investments from venture-capital firms into therapy startups such as Talkspace and Calm, according to market researcher CB Insights. </p><p>\n  CVS, with its Aetna insurance business, stands to benefit as both a seller of services and as a payer, given that seeing a counselor at one of the stores costs less than alternatives such as an emergency-room visit. An in-store therapist wouldn't provide long-term therapy or treatment for disorders that require more than five or six visits. </p><p>\n  Walmart is adding in-person counseling via its Walmart Health locations, which are medical centers attached to Walmart Supercenters. The retailer offers in-person counseling at Walmart Health sites in Arkansas and Georgia and plans to expand to Illinois and Florida this year. An initial 60-minute visit costs $60, according to Walmart's website. </p><p>\n  Walgreens is adding mental-health offerings as part of a deal with primary-care provider VillageMD to attach doctor's offices to hundreds of drugstores. </p><p>\n  Some mental-health experts say they are concerned about potential pitfalls in mixing retail and therapy. Adding another entity to what they say is an already convoluted system could complicate care, they say. Retailers also will need to ensure that there is no incentive to push a customer toward psychiatric medication, said Dr. Duckworth of the mental-illness alliance. </p><p>\n  Mental-health advocates generally say they welcome any system that will provide easy and visible access to services. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Tech Assists Rising </p><p>\n  Demand for Therapy </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Projects to offer mental-health therapy in stores come in addition to teletherapy models offered by retailers, healthcare organizations and other private companies that surged in popularity when much of the country was locked down by pandemic restrictions during parts of last year. </p><p>\n  Emergency rooms, family doctors and therapists say they are seeing a sharp increase in substance abuse, suicide attempts and people suffering with mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Along with mounting stress, mental-health experts say that more people are open to getting help, as celebrities from singer Demi Lovato to gymnast Simone Biles go public with their struggles. </p><p>\n  From August 2020 to February 2021, the percentage of adults with recent symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder increased to 41.5% from 36.4%, according to a joint survey by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Census Bureau. Emergency-room visits for mental-health crises among 12- to 17-year-olds increased 31% between 2019 and 2020, the CDC reported in June. </p><p></p>",
