  "text": "<p><strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> raised profit targets for the current year after reporting a continued recovery in demand.</p> <p>The platinum chemicals specialist cautioned however that end market demand remains uncertain with the potential for supply chain disruption in autos markets. </p> <p>For the year ending March 2022, Matthey guided for underlying operating earnings growth in the&#xa0;low to mid teens based on constant precious metal prices and constant currency. Consensus forecasts for underlying earnings centre at around £600m, implying little or no growth. </p> <p>For the full year ended March Matthey posted a pre-tax profit of £238m, down 22 per cent on higher administrative costs, impairments and restructuring charges. Revenue grew 8 per cent to £15.7bn driven by higher average precious metal prices.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Equiniti</strong>, which does paperwork for investment managers and hedge funds, has agreed to be taken private by private equity group Siris Capital for £673m. The deal, priced at 180p per share, represented a 56 per cent premium to its closing stock price on February 8 when Siris's interest was made public. </p> <p><strong>Daily Mail and General Trust</strong> reported a 17 per cent drop in half-year adjusted pre-tax profit to £47m as growth from corporate information services was offset by the temporary shuttering of its events business and a weaker performance from newspapers and websites. Revenue from consumer media, which includes its newspaper operations, fell 13 per cent on an underlying basis to £604m. </p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> and Sanofi said they have begun enrolment for a phase-three clinical trial of their Covid-19 vaccine candidate with a target of gaining regulatory approval in&#xa0;the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Insurer <strong>Aviva</strong> said in a trading update that new business premiums were steady at £8.3bn in the first quarter. The positive performance reinforces confidence in hitting previously announced targets, said chief executive officer Amanda Blanc.</p> <p>Retailer <strong>Pets At Home</strong> posted an annual underlying pre-tax profit to March of&#xa0;£87.5m, down 6.4 per cent year on year but ahead of previous guidance. The company said that strong momentum across retail and veterinary operations had continued in the new financial year, underpinning an underlying pre-tax profit target of between £120m to £130m.</p> <p><strong>AJ Bell</strong> posted a pre-tax profit to March of £31.6m on revenue of £73.9m, up 39 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. The investment platform reported total net inflows for the year of £3.1bn, lifting its assets under administration by 35 per cent to £65.2bn.</p> <p><strong>Bodycote</strong> said it was “cautiously optimistic” about the remainder of the year after revenue trends improved across most of its key markets. The engineer said group revenue from the start of the year to the end of April was £208m, down 4 per cent adjusting for currency movements, as subdued conditions in aerospace and defence offset a recovery in automotive markets.</p> <p><strong>Tate &amp; Lyle</strong> cautioned that current year earnings will weaken year on year because of “significantly lower” commodities profits and an increase in the adjusted effective tax rate. The ingredients maker posted a £335m pre-tax profit for the year ended March, up 6 per cent, on flat revenue of £2.8bn. Tate said it continued to explore the sale of a controlling stake in its Primary Products division to a long-term financial partner.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Big Oil suffered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa9946b9-371b-46ff-b127-05849a1de2da\">a climate backlash</a> on Wednesday after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/340501e2-e0cd-4ea5-b388-9af0d9a74ce2\">a court ordered</a> <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> to aggressively slash carbon emissions and <strong>ExxonMobil</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da6dec6a-6c58-427f-a012-9c1efb71fddf\">shareholders backed</a> an activist investor that said the supermajor faced “existential risk” because of its focus on fossil fuels. Campaigners hailed the day as a breakthrough moment in the oil industry's history, as the urgency of the climate crisis arrived at the door of some of the world's biggest fossil fuel producers.</p> <p><strong>Tesla</strong> is set to take the unusual step <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49459668-7eab-4589-8338-059e06b9fd8a\">of paying in advance</a> for chips to secure its supply of the crucial materials and is also exploring buying a plant as part of efforts to overcome the global shortage, according to people familiar with the matter. The US electric-car maker is discussing the proposals to secure chip supply with industry operators in Taiwan, South Korea and the US, they said. </p> <p>Shares in China's fastest-growing ecommerce company <strong>Pinduoduo</strong> fell again <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b2e3e24-8ae7-488d-a7de-eafeece077cc\">on Wednesday</a>, adding to a rout that has knocked $100bn off its market value since February. Pinduoduo's Nasdaq-listed shares fell as much as 7.1 per cent after the shopping app booked a first quarter net loss of Rmb2.9bn ($454m) despite reporting revenues of Rmb22.2bn ($3.47bn), a rise of 239 per cent on the previous year and above analysts' expectations.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>Buyouts of familiar names such as pub landlord Marston's and Asda have mobilised the Daily Mail this week to run articles such as “Ten deals to make your blood boil”. It's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f78278eb-4b31-4982-b06b-f334738ae824\">worth pausing</a> to look at the conditions that created the current deal glut and what's clear is that this is not a feeding frenzy but at a release of pent-up demand within a narrowing window to act.</p> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>Usually corporate governance is the bailiwick of the Financial Conduct Authority. Preserving national security falls to the government. Blocking listings, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2af96a47-4a9f-4380-9ec9-fa25021b908d\">as the government plans to do</a>, is no way to foil spooks.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Johnson Matthey raises profit targets but warns about uncertainty in the autos industry' FT.com 27 May.
