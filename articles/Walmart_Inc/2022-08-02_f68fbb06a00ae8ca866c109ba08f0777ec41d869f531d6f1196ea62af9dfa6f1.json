  "title": "PayPal stock jumps 9% as company confirms Elliott stake and names EA exec as new CFO amid earnings beat; Elliott has a roughly $2 billion investment in PayPal, cheering 'unmatched and industry-leading footprint,' as payments company beats earnings expectations",
  "text": "<p>PayPal shares PYPL jumped 9% in late trading Tuesday, after rocketing to their best day in two years last week amid reports that Elliott had taken a stake in the business. Elliott confirmed the involvement in Tuesday's report, just as the activist investor did Monday afternoon with struggling Pinterest Inc. PINSas it reported earnings</p><p>\"As one of PayPal's largest investors, with an approximately $2 billion investment, Elliott strongly believes in the value proposition at PayPal,\" Elliott Managing Partner Jesse Cohn said in a statement included in PayPal's release. \"PayPal has an unmatched and industry-leading footprint across its payments businesses and a right to win over the near- and long-term.\"</p><p>He added that PayPal's report \"highlights a number of steps that have been underway and are being initiated to help realize the significant value opportunity\" in the business.</p><p>The company is bringing on Electronic Arts Inc. EA Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen to serve in the same role at PayPal. He replaces John Rainey, who stepped down earlier this year to become Walmart Inc.'s WMT CFO.</p><p>Even before Jorgensen joins the company Wednesday, PayPal executives announced a variety of financial initiatives including a new $15 billion share-repurchase authorization and cost-savings program that they expect will deliver $900 million in savings this fiscal year and $1.3 billion in savings next year. The executives are targeting operating margin expansion for 2023.</p><p>A key question headed into PayPal's report was whether the company would again lower revenue guidance for the full year after a string of cuts earlier this year. Executives ended up reducing their forecast and now model roughly 10% growth on a spot basis, versus a prior outlook for 11% to 13% growth. They also model roughly 11% growth on a currency-neutral basis, which is at the low end of the company's previous range.</p><p>Executives also anticipate about $3.87 to $3.97 in adjusted EPS for the full year. The company's previous forecast called for $3.81 to $3.93 in adjusted EPS.</p><p>For the latest quarter, the company posted a net loss of $341 million, or 29 cents a share, whereas it logged net income of $1.18 billion, or $1.00 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. The loss in the latest quarter reflected negative impacts from strategic-investment losses and a tax charge related to acquired intellectual property.</p><p>On an adjusted basis, PayPal earned 93 cents a share, down from $1.15 a share a year earlier but above the FactSet consensus, which was for 87 cents a share.</p><p>PayPal's revenue climbed to $6.81 billion from $6.24 billion, while analysts had been modeling $6.78 billion.</p><p>The company generated $339.8 billion in total payments volume, or the value of transactions processed through its platform, up from $311.0 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts were expecting $342.8 billion in TPV.</p><p>PayPal had 429 million active accounts as of the second quarter, essentially flat with its first-quarter total but up from 403 million active accounts in the second quarter of 2021. Executives said earlier this year that they would become less focused on absolute user growth as they looked to better monetize PayPal's higher-value users.</p><p>For the third quarter, PayPal's management team expects net revenue growth of 10%, or 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The projection would equate to about $6.80 billion, whereas analysts tracked by FactSet were looking for $6.78 billion.</p><p>PayPal executives also expect 94 cents to 96 cents in adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, while analysts had been anticipating 95 cents.</p><p>The company is engaged in an \"information-sharing agreement\" with Elliott and will \"continue collaboration across a range of value-creation opportunities,\" per the release.</p><p>PayPal stock jumps 9% as company confirms Elliott stake and names EA exec as new CFO amid earnings beat</p>",
