  "text": "<p>A fine-art painter by trade, São Paulo native Siloé Oliveira covers not only the shovels and seeds of gardening on his YouTube channel, Suburban Homestead. He also applies his visual acumen, via 3-D sketches, as he walks viewers through the development of his Frederick, Md., garden. \"I try to share the principles I learned in the study of art to help people craft more pleasing and harmonious spaces,\" he said. In a recent episode from his \"Cottage Garden\" series, for example, the self-described weekend gardener brings to bear concepts such as balance, symmetry, rhythm and proportion as he positions beds for a vegetable garden alongside his modest Victorian home. And before he breaks up and transforms the concrete of a skinny sidewalk-like strip into a curving, beckoning path (he's frugal, too), he injects a lesson on conjuring a sense of place. He also imparts practical tips like this: The easiest way to suss out the sunny spots in your garden is to note where winter snow melts first.</p><p>Down-Home Planting</p><p>Perpetual putterer Jessica Morgan's YouTube channel, Kreatyve Gardenista, takes you along as she landscapes her Greensboro, N.C., home, her first. Projects often commence with her invite of \"Let's get to work, y'all\" and include planting spring beds, moving shrubs to better locations and potting plants (with homey tips like laying a dryer sheet at planter bottoms to keep soil from spilling out the drain hole). She gleefully unbags sad-looking hydrangeas snagged from Walmart's clearance rack, then shows the massive, perked-up blooms that later flank her front door. Like a charmingly obsessed friend, the mortgage banker introduces species she is adding, then zooms in on them and quietly enthuses, \"Hey, you guys, look at that. Isn't it gorgeous?\" Totally infectious.</p><p>Plots Across the Pond</p><p>Partners of the West London outdoor-design firm The Distinctive Gardener, Nick Gough and Douglas Vieira created their eponymous YouTube channel in 2018 because they believe everyone should have access to good garden design, said Mr. Gough. Against a soundtrack of classical music, the pair admits viewers into British and European home gardens. \"People love to be taken through each design and for me to describe the elements and why we included them,\" said Mr. Gough. In explaining, for instance, the reasons Hakonechloa grass and spiky Salvia were planted to help transform a London row-house plot into a flower-filled oasis, he says, \"They provide movement and excitement.\" Before-and-after images lend the makeovers that much more kick.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are your favorite gardening channels?
