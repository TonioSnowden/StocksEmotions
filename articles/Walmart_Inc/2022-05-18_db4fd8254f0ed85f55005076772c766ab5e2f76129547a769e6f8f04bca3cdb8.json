  "title": "Biden Invokes the Defense Production Act to Increase Baby-Formula Supply; The administration is also authorizing flights to import baby formula from overseas",
  "text": "<p>\"Imports of baby formula will serve as a bridge to this ramped up production, therefore, I am requesting you take all appropriate measures available to get additional safe formula into the country immediately,\" Mr. Biden said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.</p><p>Last week, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki played down the possibility that the U.S. could invoke the Defense Production Act to boost production of infant formula in the short term.</p><p>\"The production of baby formula is so specialized and so specific, that you can't say to a company that produces something else: Produce baby formula,\" she said.</p><p>The White House has come under pressure in recent days to address a baby-formula shortage that was caused by a mix of supply-chain issues and a recall, which led to empty shelves at some stores, product restrictions and panic among parents and caregivers searching for formula to feed babies.</p><p>Earlier this week, U.S. health regulators took steps to allow more foreign baby formula on American shelves, easing rules that had effectively prevented shipments from many overseas manufacturers. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday said it encouraged the overseas manufacturers to apply to ship their formula to the U.S.</p><p>Even with the change in rules, an FDA official said it could be weeks before the products come to U.S. store shelves. Manufacturers will first have to apply with the agency to be able to ship their products to the U.S., and then the agency will have to conduct a review to assure quality control and safety.</p><p>Later Wednesday, the House is expected to pass legislation to give the FDA $28 million, which Democratic supporters of the bill said would enable the agency to hire staff to ensure the quality of new infant formula.</p><p>The House also was set to pass a separate bill that would allow people buying formula through the federally funded WIC program to switch brands during shortages. Currently, states may obtain waivers enabling recipients to buy off-contract formula, but the process isn't automatic during emergency periods. WIC is administered by the states, providing food assistance to pregnant and postpartum women and young children, subject to income caps.</p><p>Supplies of baby formula have been running low since late 2021, and shortages deepened after Abbott Laboratories, which makes Similac baby formula, in February halted production at its biggest factory while food-safety regulators investigated possible contamination. Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, maker of Enfamil products, has dealt with pandemic-driven shipment and transport delays, while smaller formula brands have been limited on how much they are able to increase production.</p><p>Abbott said Monday it had reached an agreement with the FDA to reopen the Sturgis, Mich., plant, and the company has said it is working to boost production of Similac at other facilities, while flying in some formula from Europe. Reckitt is running plants seven days a week to produce more Enfamil, the company has said, and Gerber parent Nestl√© SA has said it would bring in extra formula by plane from Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p><p>Administration officials previously said the White House had been working with Abbott and the three other formula makers to identify transportation, logistical and supplier hurdles to increasing production of formula at their U.S. and FDA-approved facilities.</p><p>The FDA on March 1 asked some retailers to limit customers' formula purchases, and Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Kroger Co. and other retailers have implemented buying limits in stores and online. As of early May, about 21% of powdered baby formula was out of stock in U.S. stores, research firm IRI estimated.</p><p>Some retailers have sought alternate supplies, though with limited success. Some supermarket operators have tried to use store brands to fill the gaps, though those supplies have run short as well. Doctors and consumer groups have said buying limits prompted some consumers to buy as much as they could, making shortages worse, while resellers have purchased formula to sell online.</p><p>Annie Gasparro and Jaewon Kang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Invokes the Defense Production Act to Increase Baby-Formula Supply</p>",
