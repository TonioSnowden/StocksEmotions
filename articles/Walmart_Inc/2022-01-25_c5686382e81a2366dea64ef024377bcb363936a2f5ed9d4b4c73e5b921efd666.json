  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  The Uyghurs, Isolationism and the Warriors",
  "text": "<p>   Regarding Daniel Henninger's column \"Progressive to Uyghurs: Drop Dead\" (Wonder Land, Jan. 20): The plight of the Uyghurs finally hit the front page when Chamath Palihapitiya, minority owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, admitted he couldn't care less about them. Early last week my workout pals asked, \"What's a Uyghur?\" A few days later, they were all over it. </p><p>   The NBA and its licensees rely on the Chinese government for a growing share of its revenue. One cannot expect Mr. Palihapitiya to bite the hand that feeds his players. Indeed, Chinese money and influence are embedded in most aspects of our economy. What Mr. Henninger calls \"progressive isolationism\" is really a lack of will to see beyond the bottom line. </p><p>    Connie Lovell </p><p>   Pinehurst, N.C. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    If by \"care\" Mr. Palihapitiya means doing anything to punish the Chinese Communist Party, then he is correct. We still buy Chinese goods at Amazon and Walmart, send our team to the Olympics, watch China-wood movies and wokify our military. </p><p>    Brian Brandt </p><p>   Lansdale, Pa. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Thirty years ago, Golden State Warriors guard Sarunas Marciulionis resurrected the Lithuanian national basketball team following a half-century of Soviet oppression. He did so with the financial and in-kind support of Warriors leadership (Donnie Nelson), the corner bank (Bank of America) and a popular local rock band (the Grateful Dead). In the 1992 Olympics, Mr. Marciulionis led Lithuania to a bronze-medal victory over the Russians. The players were celebrated as heroes. </p><p>   I encourage Mr. Palihapitiya to brush up on the history of the team he owns. </p><p>    Thomas C. Shumaker Jr. </p><p>   Jackson, Wyo. </p><p></p>",
