  "title": "How Alice Walton Is Doubling Down on Her Mega-Museum in Arkansas; The only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton brought priceless artworks to Bentonville. Now, a decade on, she's taking on the establishment with ambitious expansion plans to make the museum—and the town—a world-class destination.",
  "text": "<p>When Walton announced plans for Crystal Bridges she could have used a guard dog. In 2005, she outbid New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art for Asher B. Durand's 1849 painting Kindred Spirits for $35 million, setting an auction record for an American artist, and revealed plans to open a museum. The art press was vicious. \"Not-so 'Kindred Spirits,'\" was the L.A. Times headline for an article that claimed Walton committed a crime against humanity by using Walmart cash to snatch up important pieces of American art and squirrel them away in Bentonville, Arkansas.</p><p>Now, as she celebrates the museum's 10-year anniversary, does she remember that furor? \"How could I forget?\" Walton, 71, says with a laugh. \"I was so naive about opening a museum. I thought we would just go about our business and buy the art and build the building and then one day open the doors and say, 'Come on in.' I felt like Kindred Spirits was really important to our collection and to the story we wanted to tell as an American art museum.\" The negative attention did not deter Walton, who went on to acquire more important pieces from iconic American artists (including Georgia O'Keeffe, Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Kehinde Wiley, Titus Kaphar and more) and hired renowned architect Moshe Safdie to build a 200,000-square-foot museum space on the edge of a natural spring on her family's land. The doors to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art opened on November 11, 2011—\"Veteran's Day!\" Walton remembers—and the cultural map of Middle America was redrawn.</p><p>\"Alice did have adversity accomplishing her dream. Not all people were helpful in helping her obtain the works she wanted to share,\" says the artist James Turrell. \"I must say Alice has more patience and perseverance than most people have, and that she is somebody who proceeds with clear purpose and is very goal-oriented in a persistent manner.\" The Way of Color is the name of Turrell's SkySpace, as his site-specific light installations are termed, at Crystal Bridges. \"Alice commissioned the Skyspace work in person, and it was the fastest completed Skyspace of any of the more than 100 Skyspaces I have done.\"</p><p>In the past decade, more than five million visitors have visited the museum's 120-acre campus, which includes five miles of trails that connect to downtown Bentonville. According to Walton, many visitors in its first year told her that they had never been to a museum of any kind before. \"The motivation for Crystal Bridges was access for all and particularly for people who never had it,\" Walton says. The museum welcomes 50,000 schoolchildren each year as part of its free educational field-trip program; it has become a destination for art aficionados from around the country. And it's free of charge.</p><p>This April, the museum announced that its space would grow by 50 percent, adding 100,000 additional square feet of art galleries—increasing exhibition space by 65 percent—as well as an \"event plaza\" space and educational programming space. Safdie will again oversee the architecture, which will incorporate materials such as local timber and fieldstone. Construction is set to begin in 2022 and is anticipated to be completed in 2024.</p><p>\"There has always been this kind of disparagement and downcast look at Middle America from the coasts,\" Walton says. \"I wanted to do Crystal Bridges primarily for the community and the region, but I also wanted to inspire people to get to know this beautiful part of the heartland and change their view about what exists here. That was a very intentional thing, and it's one of the things I'm most proud of.\"</p><p>The entire Walton brood grew up in these Arkansas woods. Sam Walton founded Walmart in 1962, and was the father of four children. (He died in 1992, after building the nation's largest retail chain at the time.) Alice, who did not make her career in the family business, was the youngest. She attended Trinity University in San Antonio and earned a bachelor's degree in economics and finance. Before Crystal Bridges, she was the head of all investment-related activities at Arvest Bank Group and, in 1988, founded the investment bank Llama Company in Fayetteville, Arkansas, serving as president, chair and CEO. She was married and divorced twice and has no children.</p><p>In the family, she is part of what is known as G2, which stands for second generation; G3, composed of Walton's nieces and nephews, continues to build out Bentonville's cultural attractions. Between 2010 and 2020, the population of Bentonville rose nearly 55,000, an increase of over 50 percent. \"Bentonville was a town of 2,000 when I was growing up,\" Walton says. \"But who's counting?\"</p><p>\"She created a museum that was not a 19th-century idea of a museum, with ascending steps, gatekeepers on top who get to decide who can come in and who can't and curators who've prepackaged what you are about to experience,\" says Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, a social justice philanthropic organization with an endowment of $16 billion. \"The first impression is the beauty of the context of Northwest Arkansas.\"</p><p>Walker met Walton in 2014, when she called on him to discuss the lack of diversity among curators in American museums. \"That's how my love affair with Alice Walton began,\" he says. \"People often think these projects are sort of follies when, in fact, they represent the future. It demonstrates the possibility of when a visionary like Alice commits to building a great institution,\" Walker says. \"She joins a pantheon of intelligent, determined and courageous women who have defined American culture.\" He compares her to Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr., whose art collection was the foundation of what became the Museum of Modern Art. \"They are of an ilk of women who had to endure the harsh and unfair sexist critique from male gatekeepers,\" he says.</p><p>Thelma Golden, the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem, groups Walton with figures such as Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of New York's Whitney Museum, \"a woman who created an incredibly important institution in the face of many who questioned its validity and importance,\" and Peggy Guggenheim, who was criticized for being eccentric in her day but whose Venetian palazzo is now a renowned international art destination. \"I'm impressed by her perseverance, her sense of purpose, her clear intention,\" Golden says. \"Alice's idea about making art available to her community, and to do so with the highest standards, is an incredibly important way to imagine her legacy.\"</p><p>In a rare interview from her home in Arkansas, Walton talks about her life in art, the first decade of Crystal Bridges and how, this summer, when some of America's other famous billionaires were booking travel to other galaxies, she announced the museum's expansion plans. \"I am not a part of the space brigade,\" she says.</p><p>Derek Blasberg: Did your father have any interest in art?</p><p>Alice Walton: Absolutely none.</p><p>DB: I was told he was the one who introduced you to James Turrell.</p><p>AW: That was through aviation. James is an aerospace engineer by background, so they swapped planes way back when. [Sam Walton was famous for flying his own aircraft to Walmart stores around the country for surprise check-ins.] It wasn't that my dad didn't like [art], but, like me, he'd never been exposed to it.</p><p>DB: What are your earliest art memories?</p><p>AW: I would start with nature because nature to me is the greatest art form. I've never distinguished much between nature and art. I think they're so integrated. On our family camping trips, I learned to do charcoals and watercolor, self-taught, with a little help from my mom. I would paint the scenery that inspired me. We weren't a museum-going family, because we didn't have access to museums. I'd been to the Gilcrease [Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma] once or twice, but, like so many families in rural America, it wasn't a part of our life…. That's an important issue for people in major metropolitan areas to understand. If you don't have access, you don't know it exists, and it can't influence your life in the positive and great ways that art does influence our lives.</p><p>DB: Do you remember the first piece of art that you ever acquired?</p><p>AW: I saved up my nickel-a-week allowance and paid 25 cents for a copy of Picasso's Blue Nude in my daddy's five-and-dime Ben Franklin store.</p><p>DB: How old were you?</p><p>AW: Somewhere between 8 and 10, I suspect.</p><p>DB: Did you know who Picasso was? Or did you just like the color blue?</p><p>AW: I'm not sure I remember my exact process, but I thought it was so special. I really treasured it. That's why I've never forgotten it.</p><p>DB: Would you say your collecting strategy is still similar to saving nickels and buying stuff you like?</p><p>AW: The museum's collection started in the '90s when I started buying watercolors. I had seen two Winslow Homer watercolors that I absolutely fell in love with. But when I saw the price tag, I said, \"I better start learning what I'm doing here. This is not inexpensive.\" I started reading art history books and learning about the artists. I was hooked because it gave me a view of American history and an in-depth view of the things that history doesn't cover. [Art answers] all the cultural questions and the divisive issues and inequities of each age. Those things weren't covered in the history books I got to read. The history I learned through art is much richer and much more relevant to the issues we face today in this country. I call it history in 3-D.</p><p>DB: How did you know Crystal Bridges was your calling?</p><p>AW: When I first started thinking about a museum, [I asked myself] What can I do for my part of the world, which I love so much, that wouldn't get done without my contribution? I went back to what my mother always told me when I was little. I'd ask her what to give [my cousin] Nancy on her 10th birthday, [for example] and she'd make me furious by saying, \"Give the thing you love the most.\" I was thinking about what I could do to show gratitude for this region, and Mama's words came into my head. I thought, What do I love the most? And it had to be art.</p><p>DB: Did you know this was the spot that you wanted to build it?</p><p>AW: It was our family land, where we all grew up. I brought up the idea of building a museum in one of our family meetings in the late '90s, and they said, What? We talked about it and thought, What would be the economic impact? What could it do for the region? I wanted it close to the town square. Having spent quite a lot of time in New York and having a total love and admiration for Central Park and what it brings New Yorkers, I wanted us to have something where people from all over the region could take a walk in the forest and get to know what this part of the world is all about. We talked for a couple of years, literally, and then the family voted on whether they wanted to do it. They all agreed.</p><p>DB: So it was a unanimous decision?</p><p>AW: It was a unanimous decision, yes.</p><p>DB: Being a female in the art world must have included some daunting moments. How have you dealt with sexism in what you've done with Crystal Bridges?</p><p>AW: I guess my answer is, it's not my first rodeo. If you're a woman and you want to get things done, you understand it's there and you work through it. It's better today than it was back when I was in the finance world in the '70s. But it still exists. I'm excited about Black Lives Matter and the focus on diversity and equal opportunity. That's what this country has always been about, but we still have a lot of work to do in terms of equal opportunity. I believe Crystal Bridges is right in the middle of that, and I'm proud of that.</p><p>DB: Newsweek called Crystal Bridges the most woke museum in America. Of all the museums in this country, a white woman's museum in a red state being called the most woke was, to me, unexpected.</p><p>AW: Well, we never cease to surprise you! I loved it. It goes back to a willingness to take risks and try new things and attack those difficult stories that museums should be telling.</p><p>DB: Almost half of the work from the contemporary art galleries is by artists of color. Did that work begin before the social justice movements of last year?</p><p>AW: In 2014, we started actively focusing on making our collection more diverse. We had been open about three years, and we took a view of ourselves, our staff, our board and our employees and of our collection. And we went, Whoa, this is not a picture of America. We need to be the picture of America as a staff and as an institution. Interestingly enough, we unintentionally ended up with one of the strongest collections of women artists. That happened naturally, the reason being women were so ridiculously undervalued. And I love value.</p><p>DB: In a post-#TimesUp world, everyone's looking for female artists now.</p><p>AW: [The museum collected female artists] from the start. It has been a joy for me to see that the problem of undervalued women artists has changed drastically in the last 10 years. And the same with African-American and other diverse artists too.</p><p>DB: I won't ask what your favorite piece is but I know you have a soft spot for Jeanne, a 1904 painting by Alfred Maurer.</p><p>AW: She is definitely one of my favorites. She's a bit scary. She's a woman of the night in Paris. She's got dead birds on her hat and blood running from her mouth. I bought her before the museum opened, so I had her in my home, and when I first saw her I didn't think I could live with her. But it's one of those fascinating things about great art: What you first see and react to changes over time. She changed totally in terms of the relationship I had with her. She actually became one of my best friends. I created this real bond with her, trying to understand her place and the difficulty of her life. That's what I love about Jeanne. She was the hardest one to have leave my house.</p><p>DB: How much art do you have in storage?</p><p>AW: Not much! I have this obsession about getting things out of storage. When we designed Crystal Bridges, I cut the storage in half before we even started the building because I said if it's not on our walls it needs to be on someone else's. I want us to be lenders to museums across the country. That has been the mandate. I want all of Crystal Bridges' collection to be available to Art Bridges [Walton's organization that supports American art programs at smaller museums around the country] when the curators don't have things on the walls. I want them out.</p><p>DB: Are you expanding Crystal Bridges to show more of the collection?</p><p>AW: [The expansion asks] \"We're an American art museum, and what is that?\" I've never believed we can tell the whole [American] story without the critically important Native American story, and the critically important craft story, which is such a strong part of our region and culture. Our board voted to incorporate both into the collection.</p><p>DB: One reason the Native American story may be tough to tell is because Arkansas is on the Trail of Tears, the forced displacement of Native Americans in the mid-19th century from their ancestral land by the U.S. government.</p><p>AW: One of the major roles we play as a museum is approaching and telling difficult stories, and we don't want to shy away from them. We collaborated with all of the regional tribes on the first contemporary Native American show a couple of years ago to make sure that we were presenting things as they should be from their perspective. We will continue to do that. One of my favorite sculptures in the sculpture grounds is a piece called The Place Where They Cried, by Pat Musick, which tells the story of the failures [of the U.S. government toward Native Americans].</p><p>DB: Art has increasingly become a political vehicle. Do you think this museum has a political mission as much as it does an educational and inspirational one?</p><p>AW: We all are all about telling the American story in an honest and open and fair and equitable way and creating access for people that haven't traditionally had access to it. So, if that's your charge, you're right in the middle of political issues. One of my favorite exhibitions was Border Cantos: Sight and Sound Explorations from the Mexican-American Border in 2017, which presented the issue of immigration on the border. [Photographer] Richard Misrach and [sculptor/composer] Guillermo Galindo's exhibition exposed all the issues, all the pain, all the suffering [of immigration]. And it brought humanity to this contentious political issue. Those kinds of exhibitions are important. Our job is not to tell people what they should think. It's to present the truth in an open way [so] that they can find their own narrative.</p><p>DB: You have an apartment in New York and you travel extensively, but has Arkansas always been home?</p><p>AW: Yes, and I've never been confused about that. I'm thrilled with the impact that Crystal Bridges and the efforts of my nieces and nephews and the whole family have made. I would say Crystal Bridges was the spark of a new kind of energy that could exist in this region.</p><p>DB: What would you like to see happen in Bentonville in the future?</p><p>AW: I hope we continue to grow wisely. Bentonville was traditionally a poor community, one of the poorest parts of Arkansas when I was growing up. That is not the case today, due to the tremendous success of multiple companies in the region. We're really focused on encouraging technology companies and innovators to move here, too. The history of this region, with J.B. Hunt Transport, Tyson Foods and Walmart, three Fortune 500 companies all developing here, is an entrepreneurial background and an entrepreneurial spirit. We've got to keep that energy and that creative piece as a dynamic part of the economy. Bringing in the tech sector is a family goal and a regional goal.</p><p>DB: Last question, and it's an obvious one: Do you still shop at Walmart?</p><p>AW: Yes! I get all my groceries at Walmart! And my fishing poles and my fishing lures, too.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p><p>The Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art is 200,000 square feet and is growing by 100,000 square feet, an increase of 50 percent. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the museum was 100,000 square feet and would double in size. A sculpture in the museum's collection is The Place Where They Cried, by Pat Musick. An earlier version of this article incorrectly called the work The Place Where They Cry. (Corrected on Sept. 8.)</p><p>How Alice Walton Is Doubling Down on Her Mega-Museum in Arkansas</p>",
