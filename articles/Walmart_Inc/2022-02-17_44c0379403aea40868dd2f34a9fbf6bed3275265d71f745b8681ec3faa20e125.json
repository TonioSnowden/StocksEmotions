  "title": "Dow Falls More Than 600 Points, Its Worst Day of 2022; Losses are broad-based, with nine of 11 S&P 500 groups notching declines",
  "text": "<p>The losses were broad-based. Tesla fell 5.1%, Morgan Stanley dropped 4.9% and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. slid 4.1%. Nine of the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 declined, led by the technology and communication services groups, which both fell about 3%.</p><p>Stocks have come under pressure in recent sessions from the escalation in tensions between Russia and Western allies over Ukraine. The White House warned that a Russian invasion could be imminent, and diplomatic efforts have so far been inconclusive.</p><p>The geopolitical tensions come as investors have already been grappling with high inflation and preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. These shifts have whipsawed the stock and bond markets.</p><p>\"The absolute key factor for this year is going to be inflation and monetary policy,\" said David Spika, chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management. \"The Ukraine issue is a short-term blip.\"</p><p>The developments have injected volatility across markets throughout the week. Moscow said it had pulled back some troops, which spurred a rally in markets earlier in the week. Western officials said Wednesday that Russia was actually continuing its military buildup.</p><p>All three major stock indexes are on track to notch weekly losses. The Dow is off 6.8% from its record set in early January, and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have suffered even steeper losses in 2022.</p><p>\"We've got to put more focus on what's being done on the ground, rather than what's being said,\" said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. \"My presumption is that this will be sorted out diplomatically. If markets go down a lot more, then I would think it would be an opportunity to buy.\"</p><p>Mr. Jackson said he isn't expecting a major change from Russia while its ally, China, hosts the Winter Olympics. The Games conclude this weekend, so \"we still have a little while to go before we can feel things have really dissipated on a permanent basis,\" Mr. Jackson said. \"In the interim, it's a propaganda game.\"</p><p>Some investors have said they expect inflation and monetary policy to stay center stage in coming months.</p><p>\"High and rising inflation has justly become the key preoccupation of investors. It is affecting consumer spending, business outlook, politics and, most importantly, the direction of monetary policy,\" JPMorgan Chasestrategists wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>Shares of big tech companies have been particularly sensitive to the prospect of rising interest rates. Thursday's drop in the shares of Facebook's parent pushed the company out of the ranks of the 10 largest global companies by market value. The stock is down 46% from its September peak.</p><p>Fresh data showed that weekly U.S. jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, came in at 248,000, up from the previous week. Economists had expected claims to continue edging down, given the tight labor market.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note edged down to 1.972%, from 2.044% Wednesday. Gold prices rose 1.6% to $1900.70 a troy ounce.</p><p>In corporate news, Walmart shares rose $5.35, or 4%, to $138.88 after it reported a profit that beat estimates and increased its dividend. The country's largest retailer by sales indicated it has been able to navigate higher supply-chain and wage costs, labor shortages and rising prices.</p><p>DoorDash shares surged $10.14, or 11%, to $105.03 after the food-delivery company reported a jump in revenue. Palantir Technologies tumbled $2.20, or 16%, to $11.77 after posting a wider loss.</p><p>Nvidia declined $20.04, or 7.6%, to $245.07 despite reporting record sales, making it one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500. It said its automotive segment saw a sharp drop in revenue because of supply-chain issues.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.7%.</p><p>Asian benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index was little changed, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com.</p><p>Dow Falls More Than 600 Points, Its Worst Day of 2022</p>",
