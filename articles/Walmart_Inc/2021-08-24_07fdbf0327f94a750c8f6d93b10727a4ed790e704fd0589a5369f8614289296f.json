Johnson and Biden spoke last night and according to an account from the White House they discussed the evacuation plans as well as “forging a common approach to Afghanistan policy”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Taliban has appointed Haji Mohammad Idris, a longstanding member of the Islamist militant group, as acting head of the central bank. </p> <p>The financial system in Afghanistan is under severe pressure from lack of cash and public panic.&#xa0;Most automated teller machines ran out of money the day before the Taliban seized Kabul and banks have been closed since the group took control more than a week ago.</p> <h2>More on Afghanistan: </h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Politics:</strong> The chaos in Afghanistan is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab721d36-9c63-4df5-a974-ad9b55872376\">testing Democrats' opposition</a> to US military intervention.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Tech: </strong>Ehtesab, an Afghan-led and funded app, helps Kabul residents <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/972ad8e2-54a5-4300-a317-56cc2612bfef\">steer clear of danger</a> with alerts on areas to avoid.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>The US must be realistic about its influence over the Taliban, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e11e101-15e1-4c2a-bd31-6ee2b3ec540c\">writes General John Allen</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Editorial:</strong> The Taliban should not have a veto on the Afghanistan evacuation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae4bc37d-2e5b-425e-a2ba-5eab90d479d2\">argues</a> the FT's editorial board. </p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you think the US should extend its evacuation deadline?
