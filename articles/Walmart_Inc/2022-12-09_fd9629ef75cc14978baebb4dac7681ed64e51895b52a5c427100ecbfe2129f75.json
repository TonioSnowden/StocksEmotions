  "title": "Costco Sales Growth Cools as Consumers Shift Discretionary Spending; The warehouse retailer reports a rise in revenue from membership fees",
  "text": "<p>The slower growth is both due to the quarterly comparison with massive growth last year and some pullback on spending, said Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti on a call with analysts Thursday. \"It rains on all of us during these tougher times particularly with bigger ticket discretionary items,\" said Mr. Galanti. Sales of food and household goods are strong, he said.</p><p>In recent months, large retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have noted a shift in consumer spending as food and gas prices remain elevated. Shoppers have given priority to spending on food and other necessities, more often forgoing toy, furniture and other discretionary spending, said executives at those companies during earnings conference calls.</p><p>Costco, which sells items in bulk to paying members, tends to attract higher income shoppers than many of its big-box competitors, in part, because shoppers need to have enough money to buy large quantities, even if prices are lower per item.</p><p>More high-income shoppers are coming to Costco for lower prices on a per item basis, said Mr. Galanti on the call.</p><p>Costco said sales hit $54.4 billion in the three months ended Nov. 20, beating analyst expectations of $50.4 billion, according to FactSet.</p><p>Inventory on hand declined versus previous quarters when Costco and other retailers rushed to buy goods amid supply-chain snarls and high demand. Demand for many items fell as inflation hit spendingand some of those items arrived late, bloating inventory across retailers heading into the holiday season.</p><p>Over the most recent quarter Costco offered bigger discounts to move through some late-arriving inventory, said Mr. Galanti. Some items such as fans and air conditioning units will be stored for sale next year, he said. \"Hopefully that's not a pressure point going forward. Certainly I don't think it will be as much,\" he said. At Costco inventory rose 10% in the most recent quarter, compared with the same period last year.</p><p>Costco, which earns the bulk of its profit through membership fees, reported a year-over-year increase in revenue from membership fees to $1 billion from $946 million in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, its merchandise costs decreased more than 8% to $47.8 billion.</p><p>Overall for the quarter, Costco's net income rose to $1.4 billion, or $3.07 a share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.98 a share, for the prior year.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com and Sabela Ojea at sabela.ojea@wsj.com</p><p>Costco Sales Growth Cools as Consumers Shift Discretionary Spending</p>",
