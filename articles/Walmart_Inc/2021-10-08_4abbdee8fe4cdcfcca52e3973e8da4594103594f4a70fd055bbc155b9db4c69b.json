The question now is whether employment gains are sufficient to keep the Federal Reserve on track to scale back monetary policy stimulus.</p><p>Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 194,000 in the month, compared to the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000, the Labor Department reported Friday. However, the unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, versus expectations for 5.1%, and August's report was raised 366,000 from 235,000.</p><p>“Even considering the upward revisions to prior months of an extra 169,000 jobs, today's number was still a huge miss compared to the 500,000 jobs economists were expecting,” wrote Bryce Doty is senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors&#xa0;, in emailed comments.</p><p>The spread this summer of coronavirus delta variant likely discouraged job seekers in September, despite many companies being desperate to hire, economists and business leaders say.</p><p>The labor market remains depleted from last year's recession and job growth was stronger earlier this year. In the first seven months of 2021, the economy added an average 636,000 jobs a month.</p><p>“This&#xa0;jobs number could call into question the starting point for taper late this year,” said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Va., “There are lots of positives in the report, like an uptick in average hourly earnings, but not enough to sugar coat the fact the employment picture remains murky with all the covid related cross currents.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Washington avoided an unprecedented federal default after the Senate voted late Thursday to raise the government's debt ceiling into December. The reprieve is temporary as lawmakers must head back to the bargaining table before the end of the year.</p><p>Optimism around a deal was enough to rally stocks, but that faded by Friday as investors took to the sidelines ahead of September payrolls data.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Camber Energy Inc.&#xa0;CEI remained the hottest name on Wall Street, as the oil-and-gas company's stock is once again the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges ahead of Friday's open as the recent rollercoaster ride looked set to continue.</p><p>Shares of ChemoCentryx Inc.&#xa0;CCXI&#xa0;soared on Friday after the company said that it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its ANCA-associated vasculitis therapy.</p><p>Sam's Club, the Walmart Inc.&#xa0;WMT&#xa0;warehouse shopping club, announced its holiday plans on Friday, which include the launch of a direct-to-home wine delivery service.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of AstraZeneca&#xa0;AZN,&#xa0;+0.74%&#xa0;gained on Friday after the company said an experimental asthma drug it is developing with Amgen&#xa0;AMGN&#xa0;has been given an orphan drug designation as a treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis, a rare inflammatory disease.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The U.S. oil benchmark&#xa0;CL00BRNX21 was up 1% to $79.11 a barrel, and headed for its seventh-straight weekly gain, with the contract up 4% for the week. Gold futures&#xa0;GC00&#xa0;were up modestly at $1,759.80&#xa0;an ounce.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY,&#xa0;a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was flat.</p><p>In European equities trade, the Stoxx Europe 600&#xa0;XX:SXXP fell 0.3% and London's FTSE 100&#xa0;UKX,&#xa0;-0.03%&#xa0;was flat.</p><p>China's CSI 300 index XX:000300 rose 1.3% as markets returned from a multiday holiday.
