  "text": "<p>    Ford Motor Co., Stellantis NV and General Motors Co. reported earnings last week. In some editions Monday, a Business &amp; Finance article about auto makers incorrectly said the earnings reports were earlier this week. Also, Walmart Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. warned last week that higher prices were leading shoppers to pull back. The same article incorrectly said the companies made the warnings this week. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Little or none of  Ferrari NV's 3% reduction in energy used to produce cars in the past year came from an employee's proposal. In some editions Monday, a Journal Report article about the company incorrectly attributed the reduction to the employee proposal. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    The length, width and height of the 2022 Taiga Orca Carbon personal watercraft are 9.5 feet, 3.8 feet and 3.4 feet, respectively. The vehicle's dimensions were given incorrectly as 3.5, 3 and 3.8 feet in the Rumble Seat column about electric personal watercraft in Saturday's Off Duty section. </p><p>   (See: \"OFF DUTY --- Gear &amp; Gadgets -- Rumble Seat: The Polarizing Jet Ski Gets a Quiet Makeover \" -- WSJ July 30, 2022) </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Readers can alert The Wall Street Journal to any errors in news articles by e-mailing wsjcontact@wsj.com or by calling 888-410-2667. </p><p></p>",
