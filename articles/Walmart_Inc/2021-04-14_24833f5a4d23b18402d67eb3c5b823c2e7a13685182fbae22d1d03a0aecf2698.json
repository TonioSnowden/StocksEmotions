  "text": "<p>Nearly every day, the 33-year-old salesman hits the streets of New York City, visiting one small shop after another in his quest to get the crisps stocked by every independent grocer in town. So far, he's persuaded 220 stores to carry the snack. Just 9,780 to go, he estimates.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Markiewicz, who serves as Whisps' area sales manager and oversees the local distribution network, stopped outside a bodega in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He scans the store's snack selection, which features 99-cent bags of Wise potato chips. This isn't promising. Whisps, which are on the expensive side -- Target sells a 2.12-ounce bag for $3.99 -- typically sell better amid higher-priced snacks.</p><p>But Mr. Markiewicz isn't deterred. He approaches the high counter, smiles, and launches into his pitch: \"How you doing, sir? I work for a New York-based company and we sell a cheese crisp. I'm going to give you a sample of these . . .\" The counterman interrupts, stating that the manager is out.</p><p>But Mr. Markiewicz leaves satisfied. He now has the manager's name and a reason to return.</p><p>In the hypercompetitive snack world, Whisps already is successful. The 35-person company, launched in 2015, sold more than 30 million bags last year at 65,000 retail locations across the U.S., including chains such as Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co. Independent market research shows one out of 20 households buys the snack, according to Whisps.</p><p>So why is the company courting New York City bodegas?</p><p>It's partly a matter of pride, says the company's chief executive, Ilana Fischer, a former management consultant and lifelong cheese fanatic. Many New Yorkers never see the snack because they do their shopping at independent stores, she said.</p><p>\"I have this brand I'm so proud of and my friends say, 'What are Whisps?'\" says Ms. Fischer. \"I say, 'It's a big brand and they're everywhere but here!'\"</p><p>There's also a business reason. The city's independent groceries represent a huge market. \"If I found a retail chain that had 10,000 stores, I'd put a salesperson against closing that business in a heartbeat,\" she says.</p><p>That person, of course, is Mr. Markiewicz. He has a tough job. A sales rep targeting a national chain can nail a thousand locations by closing one deal with one buyer. For Mr. Markiewicz, it's one store at a time.</p><p>He's not unarmed. He speaks fluent Spanish, which immigrant owners appreciate. He carries glossy brochures depicting all nine flavors and a messenger bag stuffed with an iPad and snack samples. If an owner says there's no room on store shelves he can build a cardboard display or attach a clip strip to a store rack.</p><p>On a good day, about one out of 10 stops results in a sale, he says. His first sale last week comes at Awesome Deli, a Williamsburg sandwich joint where owner Jamal Shamsan expresses immediate interest.</p><p>Mr. Markiewicz jumps into action, providing the cost for each case and explaining the gross-profit percentage Mr. Shamsan would earn if he prices the 2.12-ounce bags at $3.99, $4.99 or $5.99.</p><p>He offers an incentive -- 30 free single-serve packs that Mr. Shamsan can give to customers buying a sandwich. Bingo!</p><p>Down the street, the register man at a bustling deli slowly nods at Mr. Markiewicz's rapid-fire pitch: \"We're-a-New-York-based-cheese-crisp-company-one-ingredient-100%-cheese-13-grams-of-protein-one-gram-of-carbs-no-sugar-three-of-the-flavors-are-lactose-free-keto-friendly-gluten-free!\"</p><p>The counterman says he'll order the crisps using a phone app he uses to buy products from Bronx-based J &amp; J NY Distributors Corp, one of three local food-distribution companies carrying Whisps.</p><p>The winning streak ends at a Latin bodega. The elderly counterman, speaking Spanish, says he leaves the buying to his son.</p><p>The day's last stop is Parkview Market in Williamsburg. It was one of the first independents to stock Whisps, and Mr. Markiewicz visits often to ensure the owner is happy. \"Staying in is just as hard as getting in,\" he says.</p><p>Parkview co-owner Mike Ennab says more than 20 salespeople visit his deli every week, but Whisps was an easy yes: \"I love cheese!\"</p><p>\"It sells. The packaging is cool,\" he says. He gives Mr. Markiewicz a friendly nod. \"Plus, I like the guy!\"</p><p>---</p><p>anne.kadet@wsj.com</p>",
