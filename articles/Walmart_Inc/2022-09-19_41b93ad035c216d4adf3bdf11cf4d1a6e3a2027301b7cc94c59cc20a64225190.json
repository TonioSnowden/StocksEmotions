  "title": "Amazon, Pfizer Among Companies Pledging to Hire 20,000 Refugees; Major U.S. companies will help integrate recent wave of Afghans and Ukrainians",
  "text": "<p>\"As refugee crises start to fade from the headlines, companies must recognize that hiring refugees is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do,\" said Hamdi Ulukaya, the Chobani chief executive and founder of Tent, in a statement ahead of the event.</p><p>More than 100 major U.S. companies have signed up to join the Tent Partnership network.</p><p>The hiring goal of 20,000 is just a fraction of the total of Afghan and Ukrainian arrivals over the past year. U.S. government data shows close to 80,000 Afghans have arrived in the U.S. since the collapse of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan. An International Rescue Committee report published last month said about 41,000 of the resettled Afghans are working age and many of them have joined America's workforce.</p><p>The IRC report didn't say how many had found jobs. The average salary, based on a survey of 1,800 Afghan arrivals, was just over $16.50 an hour and the main hiring sectors have been manufacturing, retail and food services, the IRC data showed.</p><p>The Tent Partnership says around 150,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the U.S. on a variety of visas, including tourist visas, which wouldn't make them eligible to work. About 50,000 have arrived through the U.S. government United For Ukraine program, which aims to provide Ukrainians with a pathway to seek refuge in the U.S.</p><p>Major companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have emerged as key destinations for Afghans and other refugees looking for their first job in America.</p><p>Monday's pledges included a promise by Amazon, which says it will hire 5,000 refugees in the next three years, and by Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Marriott International Inc., which have each pledged to hire 1,500 refugees. Pfizer said it would hire 500 refugees.</p><p>\"Being displaced from your homeland and having to start again somewhere is never easy, which is why we are committed to helping where we can,\" said Janet Saura, vice president, employee relations, WW Amazon Stores and Corporate.</p><p>Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon, Pfizer Among Companies Pledging to Hire 20,000 Refugees</p>",
