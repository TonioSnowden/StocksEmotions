  "text": "<p>Early signs pointed to more muted activity than last year. People spent $5.3 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, up 2.9% from the holiday last year, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks spending on websites. Adobe forecasts that online spending on Black Friday itself will be between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, up 1% to 3% from a year ago.</p><p>Gabriela Faria, a 26-year-old substitute teacher from Yonkers, N.Y., was at her local Kohl's by about 5 a.m. to take advantage of deals for her Christmas shopping. Also, she said, because after two years of avoiding the Black Friday tradition because of Covid, \"I'm over online shopping.\"</p><p>She and her friends made a plan to go out this year. \"We want to go and touch things, see them and just get them now,\" she said.</p><p>At the store, about a half-dozen employees clustered near the front entrance greeting arriving customers. The registers were free of lines, and signs advertised discounts throughout the store.</p><p>With many stores closed on Thanksgiving, retailers prepared for a surge on Friday. Sales, excluding car dealerships, were forecast to increase 15% compared with Black Friday last year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all payment types. Sales at physical stores were expected to rise 18% on Black Friday, while online sales were expected to be up 3.7%, Mastercard said.</p><p>\"This is the closest to a normal Black Friday that we've had in several years,\" said Stephen Lebovitz, chief executive of mall owner CBL &amp; Associates Properties.</p><p>Many retailers started dangling big discounts in October to unload excess inventory as supply-chain bottlenecks have eased. But the bargains weren't enough to tempt some shoppers as concerns about inflation and the economy continued to mount. Macy's Inc., Kohl's Corp. and other chains said sales slowed in October and early November as people delayed holiday purchases, although the business picked up in recent weeks as cold weather blanketed the Northeast and other parts of the country.</p><p>On Wednesday, the University of Michigan released its November consumer-sentiment index, which fell 5.2% from October and is down 15.7% compared with November 2021. \"Along with the ongoing impact of inflation, consumer attitudes have also been weighed down by rising borrowing costs, declining asset values and weakening labor-market expectations,\" said Joanne Hsu, the survey's director.</p><p>One casualty of the pandemic that isn't returning in full force is the traditional door-buster -- goods offered at deep discounts for a limited time, typically during early-morning hours, to draw customers. Shoppers often lined up for deals on big-screen TVs and other goods. At times, the crowds turned dangerous, as people stampeded into stores to get items before they sold out. \"Door-busters scare people,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry adviser of market-research firm NPD Group Inc. \"They don't want to fight the crowds and get up at 4 a.m.\"</p><p>Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy Co., and Macy's are among the chains that stopped doing door-busters during the pandemic, when they had to limit the number of people in stores for health reasons. They have switched to promotions that run for longer periods, sometimes all day or a week.</p><p>Target has been dropping new deals every Sunday since October, including Black Friday deals available this week. Walmart started offering \"Black Friday Deals for Days,\" starting Nov. 7. Best Buy's Black Friday sale began Nov. 20. And Macy's started offering early-access deals on Nov. 7, with its entire Black Friday promotions available Nov. 20 through Nov. 26.</p><p>\"We were getting complaints from customers, who were coming in only to find the item they wanted was sold out,\" Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said of its door-busters. \"People want to shop when they want to shop. They don't necessarily want to come in during that morning window.\"</p><p>Arianna O'Dell, a 32-year-old songwriter who lives in Manhattan, bought a dishwasher in October for 30% off as a Christmas present for herself. \"I thought, maybe I should wait until Black Friday,\" Ms. O'Dell said. \"But I didn't want to be up until midnight on Thanksgiving.\"</p>",
