  "text": "<p>U.S. equities have wavered over the past week, after a strong run this year. The Dow has jumped 18% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 25% and the Nasdaq is up 23%. Stocks have been boosted by aggressive central-bank support, though many central banks are starting to pare back their stimulus programs. The Federal Reserve has started to \"taper\" its bond-buying program, and the Bank of England could raise interest rates as soon as next month.</p><p>Worries about inflation have also sapped markets of the momentum that propelled stocks to records earlier in the fall. Higher rates could knock stocks and other riskier assets that have benefited from 18 months of monetary stimulus.</p><p>\"We're moving toward a period now of maybe a bit more volatility,\" said Frank Ã˜land Winther, global chief strategist at Danske Bank, pointing to Covid-19 cases in Europe, trouble in China's property sector and inflation in the U.S. as potential challenges for the market. \"The returns we have seen this year so far just cannot continue.\"</p><p>Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department said, suggesting consumers weren't put off buying by rising inflation. Walmart and Home Depot reported higher sales.</p><p>But that doesn't paint the full picture, said Peter Boockvar, the chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Since March, inflation has been increasing faster than retail sales and wages. That means that in real terms, both have been falling. \"It's hard to sustain retail sales on a volume basis when real wages are down,\" he said.</p><p>Government bond yields fell, pivoting from a recent advance. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.603% Tuesday from 1.621% Monday. Yields move in the opposite direction of prices.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies retreated, a sign that riskier assets could be losing momentum. Bitcoinbriefly fell below $59,000, its lowest price in November.</p><p>The decline hit stocks in the crypto industry. Bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase Global fell 1.9% and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital slid 3.3%.</p><p>Energy markets were volatile. European natural gas prices jumped almost 10% after German regulators suspended the certification process for a new pipeline linking Russia to Germany. Traders had hoped that Nord Stream 2, which is completed but not operational, would start to send gas toward Western Europe in the coming months.</p><p>Gold prices slipped 0.2% to about $1,873 a troy ounce. The precious metal has rallied to five-month highs in a sign of growing unease about the inflation outlook.</p><p>Overseas stock markets were mixed. Gains for telecom and auto stocks pushed the pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.2%. Vodafone Group rose more than 5% after the U.K. telecom company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Thyssenkrupp jumped 12% after a media report said the German conglomerate was looking to list its electrolysis unit.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.3%, Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1% and China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%.</p><p>Stocks Edge Higher as Retail Sales Grow</p>",
