  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: In Kroger Deal, Key Is Local Overlap",
  "text": "<p>Kroger's plan to acquire rival Albertsons, announced last week, would combine the biggest and second-biggest supermarket companies in the country by sales, which operate a combined total of about 5,000 stores stretching from California to Washington, D.C.</p><p>The companies' combined market share of 13% of U.S. grocery sales would rank below Walmart's 22%, and their combined annual sales of more than $200 billion would remain below the nearly $500 billion generated by Amazon, which has been pushing into the U.S. grocery market via its 2017 deal for Whole Foods Market and other services.</p><p>\"The merger will accelerate our position as a more compelling alternative to larger and nonunion competitors,\" Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said when the deal was announced, without naming specific rivals. Kroger and Albertsons said that merging will give them more of a national footprint and a wider network of suppliers, in addition to greater manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and Cory Booker (D., N.J.) this week urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the proposed merger, warning about its potential effect on consumers. Ms. Klobuchar, chairwoman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights, and Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) said they would hold a hearing on the proposed deal next month.</p><p>FTC representatives declined to comment.</p><p>The antitrust enforcers who could decide the Kroger-Albertson deal's fate have tended in other cases to examine potential impacts at a local level, according to antitrust lawyers and industry advisers. That includes considering market share and overlaps in specific geographic regions, including some big-box retailers that sell groceries along with other goods, they said.</p><p>Benjamin Dryden, a partner at Foley &amp; Lardner LLP, said that competition authorities have typically looked within a radius of between two to 10 miles to measure grocery markets and exclude discounters, such as dollar stores, from their analysis. \"The FTC is going to take this very seriously,\" he said.</p><p>The companies have said that they believe they have a path to regulatory approval with divestitures. When announcing the deal, they said that they are prepared to establish a subsidiary with 100 to 375 stores that would be spun off to Albertsons shareholders and that they have agreed to determine which stores to potentially divest. The companies have agreed to sell up to 650 stores.</p><p>In some markets, Kroger and Albertsons-owned supermarkets compete head-to-head for shoppers' dollars. Kroger in Southern California operates Ralphs supermarkets while Albertsons runs its eponymous chain as well as Vons. In Chicago, Kroger runs the Mariano's chain and Albertsons operates the competing Jewel-Osco stores, and in Seattle, Albertsons owns Albertsons and Safeway while Kroger runs Fred Meyer and QFC.</p><p>Kroger and Albertsons would compete more effectively as a combined entity, the companies said, as new competitors push into the market and shoppers increasingly buy groceries online.</p><p>Kroger and Albertsons likely had anticipated a lengthy and thorough antitrust review and are trying to get ahead of issues the FTC may be concerned about, said Alexis Gilman, a partner at Crowell &amp; Moring LLP who previously spent seven years at the agency.</p><p>The agency would likely look at the range of stores that Kroger and Albertsons will propose selling, and the executive teams of those stores, antitrust lawyers said.</p><p>\"The FTC is a lot more rigorous in their review of remedy packages and divestiture buyers,\" Mr. Gilman said, versus how the agency approached deals under administrations over the past few decades. He said there is a heightened chance the agency chooses to litigate a case, rather than settling it.</p>",
