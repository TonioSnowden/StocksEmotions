  "text": "<p>Dixons Carphone has reinstated its dividend after a sales boom in homeworking equipment, coffee machines and game consoles during lockdowns helped it swing back to profit.</p> <p>The London-listed group, which is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0179e20-3557-4df5-b618-9f89618aef3d\">rebrand its UK business Currys</a>, said on Wednesday that online sales of electronics more than doubled to £4.7bn in the year to May. </p> <p>Soaring demand for gadgets and devices among people stuck at home helped the company reach a pre-tax profit of £33m, compared with a £140m loss the year before. It also offset the impact of store closures, with like-for-like revenues up 2 per cent to £10.3bn. </p> <p>“Technology has become even more central to people's lives,” said chief executive Alex Baldock, adding that three-quarters of Dixons' customers were now spending more on tech than before the pandemic, which changed habits in working and entertainment.</p> <p>With lockdown restrictions still in place in countries including the UK, it is yet unclear which lockdown habits people will stick to.</p> <p>Dixons said there was evidence of its markets being “structurally larger post-pandemic”, while analysts at Investec expected electronic sales in the UK and Ireland to drop by roughly 4 per cent over the next year.</p> <p>The financial boost from lockdown sales prompted the company to reinstate its dividend at 3p a share, adding that this was “expected to grow”. It has also repaid furlough support worth £73m and £144m in VAT deferrals to the UK government.</p> <p>Ben Hunt, analyst at Investec, said Dixons' “strong” full-year results had alleviated fears that online sales would turn out to be profit dilutive. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98253d92-6823-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">Store closures</a>, however, hit Dixons' largely store-based mobile phone business, which had £89m in losses before interest and tax. </p> <p>Dixons' share price, which over the year has recovered close to its pre-pandemic levels, was down by slightly above 1 per cent on Wednesday morning. </p> <p>The group had previously considered floating its Nordics business, something that Baldock said it had decided against. </p> <p>Baldock also brushed off a question regarding potential private equity bids following recent interest in supermarkets Asda and Morrisons. “We are super focused on what lies within our control,” he said.</p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson 2021 'Dixons reinstates dividend after homeworking boosts sales' FT.com 30 June.
