  "title": "Walmart Makes Progress on Emissions Target By Winning Over Suppliers, CSO Says; An effort to spur Walmart's suppliers to decarbonize is halfway toward a goal of reducing emissions by 1 gigaton",
  "text": "<p>Walmart says it has enlisted more than 70% of its suppliers, measured by 2021 sales, to report their emissions through the initiative. Walmart works with them to procure renewable energy, use packaging that reduces waste and adopt farming practices that sequester emissions. It regularly updates the program, including through the launch last year of a supply-chain finance program that rewards suppliers with better terms if they set science-based emissions targets or score highly with CDP, an environmental-disclosure organization.</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin discussed Walmart's approach to incentivizing suppliers in an interview with WSJ Pro Sustainable Business. A former director at consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., she is also president of the Walmart Foundation and a board member of the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, nonprofit groups that are influential in corporate climate action. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>WSJ Pro: What have you learned from getting halfway to 1 gigaton?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: One, this project really reinforces the idea of shared value. If you can make a case to people that pursuing an action benefits their organization, their goals and others that matter to them, you're going to make a lot more progress.</p><p>Second, we've tried to encourage broad participation by making it easy to get started and then having an escalator of ambition. It's daunting to say we have to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. We learned that if we translate that bold, important scientific ambition into specific, near-term, concrete steps that benefit the participant, as well as supporting society, you can make a lot of progress.</p><p>WSJ Pro: Was the first half-gigaton the low-hanging fruit?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: For suppliers that started early, they most likely tackled easier things and now it may get harder. The good news is we're engaging more and more suppliers. This last year alone, we added 1,000 new suppliers; we have 4,500 in total that have engaged since the beginning. So that's point one.</p><p>Second, we've only just begun to exhaust the suite of potential actions that suppliers can take. Project Gigaton is structured around six arenas—energy, transportation, waste, packaging, product design and nature. Every year, we add new calculators—paths that help suppliers identify potential actions they can take and then translate them into emissions reduction based on the best science from our partners, CDP and WWF and EDF [Environmental Defense Fund] and so on.</p><p>Point three, technological innovation is unlocking additional ways to succeed. For example, under nature, for years we've been working on fertilizer optimization, and now we're getting better science around things like carbon sequestration and soil.</p><p>WSJ Pro: What are some of the easier ways for suppliers to cut emissions, and what is more challenging?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: In the early days, we saw a lot of focus on the energy pillar. Energy efficiency is a great place to start because you save money as an organization. Many folks were working on things like converting to LED lightbulbs or improving the efficiency of their equipment in their factory, improving fuel efficiency of their vehicles.</p><p>More difficult would be, for example, fertilizer optimization, because you need to have engagement with the farmers. You have to know where to apply it precisely on the field and that requires different equipment in terms of monitoring and decision-making.</p><p>We provide a breakdown of the projects and you'll see more things in energy that you might have in nature in the early days. But we anticipate people to start to work in some of these other arenas as they gain confidence and as the pathways evolve.</p><p>WSJ Pro: How do you encourage suppliers?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: There's a couple ways you do it. One is simply by asking them. Typically, people say, 'OK. I'm going to please my customer.' Second, we've held workshops with suppliers.</p><p>Then we build their capabilities to set smart goals—specific, measurable, actionable goals, time-bound—and we can connect them to resources to help them. If they want to get started, for example, in packaging, but they don't know where to begin, we have our sustainable packaging playbook and a recycling playbook. We have many NGO partners that we can connect suppliers to. We've invested in publicly available tools, like something called Plastic IQ, which helps a supplier determine the optimal packaging.</p><p>The third thing has been to support them with specific programs. We work with Schneider Electric to put together a renewable-energy power purchasing agreement that suppliers can buy into. Lots of suppliers, especially smaller ones, don't have renewable-energy procurement teams.</p><p>We have a supplier financing program we developed with HSBC. It offers some better financing terms to private-brand suppliers and the possibility of getting early invoice payments if they're setting science-based targets in line with the 1.5 degree [global warming] scenario and making progress on them.</p><p>WSJ Pro: You've talked about carrots. Are there any sticks?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: We haven't had to get out the stick. We're getting the impact we need with the design of the program we have. I would say maybe the one stick [is that] suppliers want to please their customer and we're an important customer.</p><p>WSJ Pro: How do you deal with laggards?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: We'll call them into Bentonville and have the conversation, sometimes individually—especially if it's a bigger supplier who we think should have the capability and the wherewithal to go down the path on this—sometimes in a group. In the early days, we noticed in our top several hundred suppliers there were 100 that hadn't gotten started. We had a meeting where we pulled them all together. We didn't call it the nonresponder meeting; it was a workshop for Project Gigaton to help people get started, and we brought in experts to help. We literally filled a room in downtown Bentonville with round tables, everybody at tables with experts at each table, and we had a series of discussions and presentations. Certainly in the early days we did things like that. Now we have a head of steam, the momentum is pretty strong.</p><p>WSJ Pro: Could Walmart drop suppliers who don't move fast enough?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: We haven't done that to date. Could we in the future? I don't know. I don't see that we would need to do that, if I consider who's engaged in this already and the progress they're making.</p><p>WSJ Pro: Do you think you'll hit the goal before 2030?</p><p>Ms. McLaughlin: I don't know. I hope that we do because the world needs bold action and accelerated impact. Whether we do or not, we'll keep going. That's just an interim milestone. It is certainly not the end of the line for us.</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Makes Progress on Emissions Target By Winning Over Suppliers, CSO Says</p>",
