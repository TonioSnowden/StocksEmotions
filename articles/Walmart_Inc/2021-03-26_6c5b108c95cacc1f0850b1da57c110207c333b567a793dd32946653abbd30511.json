  "title": "World News:  Companies Explore  Alternatives to Suez  ----  By William Boston and Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   European and international companies are bracing for possible rising costs and growing supply-chain complications as the blockage of the Suez Canal heads into a fourth day amid signs of still longer backlogs. </p><p>   Retail and manufacturing importers are watching for delays in their supply chains that already are strained by global disruptions, and some are considering alternative routes, including sending goods using pricier airfreight or on ships sailing around Africa, which could stretch out deliveries by as long as two weeks. </p><p>   \"We are keeping an eye on the situation,\" a spokesman for Dutch brewing giant Heineken NV said, adding that a few of the company's containers are delayed. \"We feel comfortable for now with the contingencies we have in place,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   The companies are tracking the growing backlog at the Suez Canal as authorities there struggle to refloat the Ever Given, a 1,300-foot ship operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Group that got stuck in the canal. </p><p>   The Suez Canal backup mostly won't affect big U.S. retailers directly, but European companies will see a hit in an already tight shipping market, said Chris Sultemeier, a former executive vice president of logistics for Walmart Inc., the largest importer and retailer in the U.S. \"The Suez is primarily used for Asia to Europe traffic, so from a consumer goods, retailer standpoint it will have a dramatic effect on Europe,\" he said. </p><p>   Executives at some businesses are weighing the costs of waiting for the canal to reopen -- which could be days away or longer, according to shipping experts -- against the costs and timing of other transportation options. </p><p>   Freight rates for shipping containers from Asia to Europe, which have soared over the past year as retailers and manufacturers have rushed to restock inventories depleted during the pandemic, have remained steady during the Suez blockage, but that could change if it drags on. </p><p>   \"If the delays continue though, that's another story,\" said Eytan Buchman, chief marketing officer at Freightos, a Hong Kong-based digital shipping rate provider. \"If it gets bad enough and carriers choose to reroute around Africa instead of waiting for the canal to clear, importers will obviously experience delays due to the longer transit time,\" Mr. Buchman said, \"and likely increased prices because of the additional costs associated with the longer route.\" </p><p>   For the broader global economy, the Suez Canal obstruction is unlikely to have a serious impact, said Simon MacAdam, a senior global economist at Capital Economics. </p><p>   The U.S. Federal Reserve is monitoring the Suez Canal incident, and its models point to \"some slowdown in production\" as a result of broader supply-chain issues, Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday. He added that such issues could place modest upward pressure on prices of certain goods. \"But that should be something that is temporary,\" Mr. Powell said. </p><p></p>",
