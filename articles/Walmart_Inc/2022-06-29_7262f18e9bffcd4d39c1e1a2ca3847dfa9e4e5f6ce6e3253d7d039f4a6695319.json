  "title": "What Are Abortion Pills and How Widely Are They Used? Medication abortion accounts for more than half of procedures nationwide",
  "text": "<p>In these states especially, physicians and public-health experts are anticipating a surge in demand for the pill-based procedure known as medication abortion, which accounts for more than half of abortions in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute, a policy group that supports abortion rights and tracks abortion statistics. Access wouldn't be straightforward, however, and there could be potential legal ramifications for patients and healthcare providers. What is medication abortion?</p><p>Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion or plan C, involves the administration of so-called abortion pills to terminate a pregnancy. Patients obtain the pills from a prescribing clinician or from online pharmacies and can take the medications in a clinical setting or at home.</p><p>In the U.S., medication abortion has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Though their efficacy decreases as gestational age increases, abortion pills can be safe and effective beyond the 10-week mark, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In countries including the U.K., abortion pills are used to terminate pregnancies of up to 24 weeks. For later-term abortions, the pills are administered in clinical settings.</p><p>Two medications—mifepristone and misoprostol—are typically used in a medication abortion regimen. A single dose of mifepristone is followed by a course or several courses—depending on the number of weeks of pregnancy—of misoprostol pills. The regimen is safe and highly effective, reproductive health experts say, with efficacy rates of 95% if administered at 10 weeks of pregnancy or earlier.</p><p>Mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy; it and misoprostol are typically used in a medication abortion regimen.

Misoprostol is available as a generic drug and under the brand name Cytotec, which is manufactured by Pfizer Inc.</p><p>In the U.S., mifepristone is sold under the brand name Mifeprex, manufactured by Danco Laboratories, a pharmaceutical distributor based in New York, and Korlym, made by Silicon Valley-based Corcept Therapeutics. Korlym isn't prescribed or marketed for abortion in the U.S. and is approved by the FDA only for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, a hormonal disorder. A generic version of the drug, also known as RU-486, was approved by the FDA in 2019 and is distributed by GenBioPro Inc., a Nevada-based pharmaceutical company.</p><p>Costs for a medication abortion vary by state and aren't always covered by insurance. The regimen can cost up to $750, according to Planned Parenthood. U.S. telehealth providers including Hey Jane, Just the Pill and Choix charge $350 or less for a medication abortion, including pills and a medical consultation.</p><p>How common is the use of abortion pills, or medication abortion?</p><p>Medication abortion accounted for 54% of abortions in the U.S. in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Since 2000, when the FDA approved mifepristone, a steadily increasing proportion of patients have chosen medication abortions. Some 37% of U.S. abortions were medication abortions in 2017, up from 14% in 2005.</p><p>How do abortion pills work?</p><p>Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol causes uterine contractions and bleeding. Physicians say the experience is similar to a miscarriage, and typically involves several hours of heavy bleeding and cramping.</p><p>The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is very effective at terminating a pregnancy of up to 10 or 11 weeks. In rare cases where an abortion isn't completed, an additional dose of misoprostol can be taken. While extremely unlikely, an in-clinic procedure may be necessary if multiple rounds of misoprostol are ineffective.</p><p>How is medication abortion different from the morning-after pill?</p><p>While medication abortion terminates pregnancy, the morning-after pill, or emergency contraception, helps to prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation and curbing implantation. There are three types of emergency contraception pills: progestin-only pills like levonorgestrel (sold under the brand name Plan B, among others), ulipristal (brand named Ella) and combined emergency contraception pills that consist of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. </p><p>More than 30 states require a clinician to be physically present with a patient before prescribing mifepristone. PHOTO: Michael Noble Jr. for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Are abortion pills safe?</p><p>Yes. Studies have shown the two-medication abortion regimen to be safer than widely used drugs including acetaminophen, penicillin and Viagra. Major complications have been reported in less than 0.4% of patients, according to a 2013 scientific review of the efficacy and safety of the two-medication regimen. Common side effects of the regimen include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache and dizziness. The symptoms are typically short-lived and usually abate after a day or two.</p><p>The additional risk to patients taking abortion pills at home is minimal so long as the medication is acquired from reliable sources, said Nisha Verma, an obstetrician-gynecologist and ACOG fellow.</p><p>\"However, it is important that people taking medications at home have access to safe, nonjudgmental, and supportive care within the formal medical system if they need it at any point,\" Dr. Verma said. \"People who do have questions or concerns before, during or after a self-managed abortion should be able to safely and confidently get the care that they need.\"</p><p>Following a medication abortion, patients experiencing prolonged fever, severe cramping that doesn't resolve with over-the-counter painkillers, or have continued symptoms of pregnancy should seek medical care.</p><p>According to ACOG, there are a small minority of patients for whom medication abortion isn't recommended, including those with ectopic pregnancy and chronic adrenal failure. In cases of ectopic pregnancy, a medical emergency in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, patients can either be treated with a medication called methotrexate or undergo surgery. For other at-risk patients, in-clinic procedures would be the only abortion option available.</p><p>Do you need a prescription?</p><p>In the U.S., abortion pills require a prescription from a healthcare provider. Until recently, the FDA required patients to pick up mifepristone in person from a clinical setting. The agency lifted that restriction in April 2021 and allowed abortion pills to be sent by mail.</p><p>But more than 30 states require a clinician to be physically present with a patient before prescribing mifepristone. Some states have partial bans of medication abortion: In Indiana, medication abortion is banned starting at 10 weeks of pregnancy. In Texas, it is banned from seven weeks.</p><p>Patients can buy abortion pills without a prescription from online pharmacies based overseas. International health providers including Aid Access connect U.S. patients to physicians in Europe and mail them abortion pills from outside the country. The FDA has said that the online sale of abortion pills that aren't regulated by the agency is a violation of U.S. law.</p><p>\"Healthcare providers based internationally may feel more insulated\" from potential legal ramifications in the U.S., said Julia Kaye, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project.</p><p>The safety of these imported medications is also not guaranteed. Plan C, an abortion-pill advocacy group, has a pill-finding guide on its website, organized by state. For each provider listed, Plan C highlights any potential legal or safety risks. </p><p>Medication abortion accounted for 54% of abortions in the U.S. in 2020. A Planned Parenthood office in Chicago.

Wade affect access to abortion pills?</p><p>According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based advocacy organization, 25 states will likely ban or severely restrict access to in-clinic abortion procedures and medication abortions as a result of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Patients in those states would need to go to greater lengths to obtain abortion pills, such as traveling to another state or using an online pharmacy or international health provider. Those options may be inaccessible to many people, said Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic in New York.</p><p>\"Most people don't have the time or the funds,\" Dr. Shah said. \"A lot of people are going to be turning to the internet, and some may be forced into a pregnancy that they did not intend on continuing.\"</p><p>Many states had already moved to restrict medication abortions before outright bans went into place following the Supreme Court's ruling on June 24. Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill criminalizing mail-order abortion pills, while South Dakota's Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed a bill restricting medication abortions via telemedicine that goes into effect July 1. Louisiana's ban on mail-order abortion pills starts Aug. 1.</p><p>There could also be heightened legal risks. Since 2000, at least 60 people have been prosecuted in the U.S. for obtaining a medication abortion or helping someone do so, according to Plan C. If abortion becomes illegal in swaths of the country, many more patients and health providers could be charged for seeking abortions, including using mail-order services for abortion pills.</p><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both said they would defend access to abortion pills.</p><p>Would overturning Roe v. Wade affect birth control?</p><p>While Roe v. Wade doesn't specifically apply to contraceptives, reproductive rights advocates and legal experts say its overturning could have spillover effects on other rights that have been codified in law, including same-sex marriage and interracial marriage, as well as access to birth control.</p><p>Justice Samuel Alito had asserted in the leaked draft opinion that the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade concerned the constitutionality of abortion \"and no other right.\" But some legal scholars say the move could be interpreted more broadly as a challenge to the right to privacy, which forms the basis of several other laws including a right to contraception access.</p><p>A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that internet searches for abortion medication reached 350,000 during the week of May 1 to May 8, the period following the leak of the Supreme Court's draft ruling. The searches were found to be more common in states with restrictive reproductive rights.</p><p>National retailers including CVS Health Corp., Walmart Inc. and Rite Aid Corp. have seen demand spike for emergency contraception following the Supreme Court's decision. The three retailers have begun limiting the purchase of the morning-after pill, which is often referred to and sold under the Plan B brand without a prescription.</p><p>Are states that support abortion rights thinking of expanding access to abortion pills?</p><p>Lawmakers in some states, including New York, California and Connecticut, are drawing up legislation that would widen access to medication and in-clinic abortions. Measures that are being considered include protecting physicians from prosecution for prescribing abortion pills to out-of-state patients. Some states are working to increase their capacity to provide abortions.</p><p>Are healthcare providers already seeing a surge in demand for medication abortion?</p><p>Yes. Several providers have reported a marked increase in demand. \"We're absolutely seeing a huge increase in requests,\" said Christie Pitney, Plan C's provider coordinator and chief executive officer of Forward Midwifery. Some patients are requesting an advanced provision of abortion pills to have on hand in case of a future pregnancy, Ms. Pitney said.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>What Are Abortion Pills and How Widely Are They Used?</p>",
