  "text": "<p>Target and Walmart are proving “old economy” shares can crash on bad news, just like tech stocks. On Wednesday, Target announced poor first-quarter results. These included an operating profit margin of just 5 per cent, roughly half of the figure from the same quarter a year ago. Naturally, Target cited soaring labour and freight costs. More shockingly, the value retailer showed it does not know what goods consumers want to buy. </p> <p>A year ago, Target inventories were flying off shelves so fast that the business expended no net cash filling warehouses. In the most recent quarter, however, inventory balances ballooned by a whopping $1.2bn. At the same time, inventory impairments ate into profitability. </p> <p>Target blamed the mismatch on “bulky categories” such as kitchen appliances, televisions and outdoor furniture. The company has spent two years playing catch-up with pandemic shifts in taste. But now inflation is forcing Americans to conserve cash for groceries and essentials.</p> <p>Merchants who sell physical products — whether exercise bikes or microwave ovens — have to guess what customers will buy months in advance. The cost of going short is immediate lost revenue and market share. The cost of winding up long is registered in discounts on unpopular lines. Target shares, which soared during 2020 and 2021, fell 25 per cent on Wednesday, a $25bn loss of market value. Life will not get any easier for Target and other US retailers if an economic recession is imminent.</p> <p>Target announced results a day after Walmart. The numbers of the Bentonville behemoth reflected the similar inflationary challenges with fewer inventory misfires. Its shares are down 18 per cent this week. </p> <p>Retail is not just a low margin business. It requires careful management of working capital and supply chains. The smallest errors ripple through to profitability and cash flow. Disciplined companies can weather external challenges. Target is a diversified retailer. A bad year will sting shareholders but is not quite the existential crisis gripping the likes of Peloton.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Target: consumer demand guessing game foxes a pandemic winner' FT.com 18 May.
