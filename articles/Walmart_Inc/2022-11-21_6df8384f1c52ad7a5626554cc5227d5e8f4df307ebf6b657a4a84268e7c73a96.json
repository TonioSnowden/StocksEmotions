As the company also uses LIFO for tax purposes, the resulting lower taxable income means it pays less tax. Since what it pays for merchandise is the same regardless of the inventory costing method it uses, its after-tax cash flow will be higher than it would be under FIFO (first in first out) or average cost. Of course, this assumes its inventory levels don't fall during 2022, drawing older — and lower — merchandise costs into cost of sales.</p> <p><strong>Tim Sutton</strong> <br><em>Brackley, Northamptonshire, UK</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Understanding Walmart's inventory conventions' FT.com 21 November.
