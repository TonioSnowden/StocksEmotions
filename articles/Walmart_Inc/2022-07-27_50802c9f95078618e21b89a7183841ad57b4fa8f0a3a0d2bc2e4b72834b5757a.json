  "title": "Shopify Didn't Deliverr; Shopify's big bet on post-pandemic e-commerce failed, but its purchase of Deliverr Inc. last May has some on Wall Street keeping the faith",
  "text": "<p>The e-commerce tech enabler said Wednesday morning that it overestimated the pandemic's ability to permanently expand that market and that it now must recalibrate its business to meet a current reality that isn't much different from before Covid hit. The company reported slower than anticipated revenue growth for the second quarter, swinging to an operating loss. Its guidance implies third and fourth quarter revenue growth could come in well below Wall Street's expectations, leading to continued adjusted operating losses for the second half of the year. Despite the disappointing results, Shopify's shares, down roughly 80% over the past year, actually rose 3% in early morning trading following the report.</p><p>Shopify's results come just one day after the company said it was laying off about 10% of its workforce as consumers step back out to shop and pull back on online orders. Shopify's workforce ballooned from 1,900 in 2016 to roughly 10,000 in 2021, according to the company's filings—with much of the recent head count additions in support of what founder and Chief Executive Tobi Lütke had believed would be a permanent five- or 10-year acceleration in shopping mix from offline to online.</p><p>Turns out, he bet wrong: Mr. Lütke suggested in a blog post Tuesday that, in fact, the pandemic had virtually no impact on the adoption rate of U.S. e-commerce, noting the mix of e-commerce has reverted \"to roughly where pre-Covid data would have suggested it should be at this point.\"</p><p>E-commerce growth hasn't been Shopify's only big bet. Shopify said Wednesday it continues to plan to allocate $200 million to capital expenditures this year, as it works to strengthen its logistics profile and fulfillment network. In May, the company announced its largest acquisition ever, a $2.1 billion purchase of U.S. fulfillment specialist Deliverr Inc. As evidence of Shopify's commitment to logistics, the company said Wednesday that the acquisition added 450 employees— nearly half the number Shopify laid off this week across areas such as recruiting, support and sales.</p><p>It might be that Shopify has little choice but to invest in fulfillment as it works to compete for merchants against Amazon, which offers its estimated 170 million Prime members free and fast shipping for a price. As Covid fears abate, speed and convenience are really the only things keeping consumers shopping online. Shopify has outlined a goal of delivering packages in two days or less to more than 90% of the U.S. population.</p><p>Is now really the best time for Shopify to be investing so aggressively in its own business, though? Earlier this week, Walmart significantly cut its operating-income guidance for the current quarter, citing declining consumer demand and discounting in general for discretionary merchandise such as apparel. Walmart, at least, is able to lean into essential goods such as groceries—a luxury the majority of Shopify's small-business customers certainly don't have.</p><p>Wall Street is keeping the faith. Despite Shopify's massive stock declines this year, nearly half of analysts still had a Buy rating or equivalent heading into Wednesday's earnings report. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said earlier this year that an investment in Shopify would require trust that management is an efficient allocator of capital. Over the past eight years, Shopify's gross margin has averaged over 55%. But even before Wednesday's lower-than-expected guidance, analysts were forecasting that margin to dip below 50% in the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p>Supporting Shopify's stock at these levels is likely valuation. At their pandemic highs, Shopify shares fetched nearly 50 times enterprise value to sales. That multiple is now under 5 times, compared with an average of more than 11 times from the company's 2015 initial public offering to Spring of 2020 when the pandemic set in.</p><p>BMO analyst Simeon Siegel predicted in a sector-earnings preview this week that guidance revisions by companies would either be viewed as surprise or relief, based on investors' confidence going in. Those who had been \"awash in fear,\" he wrote, might be willing to pay more for a sense of \"troughing.\"</p><p>That could end up being the case for Shopify, assuming its shares continue to edge higher. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt even painted Shopify's layoffs this week in a positive light calling the move \"the great reset.\"</p><p>For a company that has shed nearly $175 billion in market value since November, perhaps the anticipated sale in Shopify shares is finally upon us.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>Shopify Didn't Deliverr</p>",
