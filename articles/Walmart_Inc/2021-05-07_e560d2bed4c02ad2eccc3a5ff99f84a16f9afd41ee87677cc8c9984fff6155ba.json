  "title": "Business News: Walmart Buys Health Provider MeMD in Push Into Virtual Care",
  "text": "<p>The strategy comes in response to Amazon.com Inc.'s business model, according to people familiar with the situation. Amazon relies on profits from its cloud computing and advertising businesses to fend off competitors online with fast, but often less profitable, home delivery of millions of products.</p><p>The MeMD deal opens another front in which Walmart and Amazon will compete, as Amazon recently announced plans to provide its telehealth service, Amazon Care, to its nearly 1 million U.S. employees by summer. Amazon Care, which now serves company workers in Washington state, will also be offered to other employers.</p><p>Just as Amazon leveraged its own data centers to create a new business selling cloud computing to customers as Amazon Web Services, both Amazon and Walmart are taking what they learn paying for the healthcare of their giant workforces to offer expansive services to their customers, helping them move into the growing U.S. healthcare market.</p><p>Many of the world's biggest companies continue to have an interest in transforming healthcare and reducing costs. Amazon initially sought to do so through a venture called Haven that it operated with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. It was set up in 2018, and it ended operations in February after failing to make progress on various pilot projects in healthcare. The company has also expanded its pharmacy offerings.</p><p>The telehealth sector is becoming increasingly competitive as giants like Walmart and Amazon jump in. Shares of the long-time sector leader Teladoc Health Inc. dropped 3% in after-hours trading following the deal's announcement.</p><p>The heightened competition has led to a wave of consolidation among telehealth providers in recent months. Others that have merged or been acquired include Doctor on Demand, MDLive, and PlushCare.</p><p>Other retailers are trying to expand further into healthcare. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and rival CVS Health Corp. are competing to become treatment centers for patients with costly conditions. Both have expanded their telehealth offerings during the pandemic, and last year Walgreens said it would attach doctors' offices to hundreds of drugstores.</p><p>Two years ago, Walmart started opening a handful of clinics in stores, with doctors and dentists offering flat-fee primary care, such as $25 dental X-rays and $40 office visits.</p><p>Walmart can build its healthcare businesses by catering to consumers who crave lower prices and more transparency in healthcare costs, according to some of the people familiar with the situation, using its approximately 4,700 stores as a base.</p><p>---</p><p>Kimberly Chin and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p>",
