  "text": "<p>   Foot Locker Inc. raised its outlook for the year after posting better-than-expected third-quarter results, with sales at existing stores edging higher. </p><p>   Shares rose nearly 9% to $35.88 in Friday trading. </p><p>   The New York City-based sneaker and athletic-wear retailer said same-store sales, which strip out effects of store openings and closings, were up eight-tenths of a percentage point from record levels seen last year. </p><p>   Overall sales slipped slightly to $2.17 billion due to the stronger dollar. Excluding the impact of currencies, Foot Locker said sales would have been up 3.3%. Analysts polled by FactSet expected sales of $2.09 billion. </p><p>   For the quarter ended Oct. 29, Foot Locker posted a profit of $96 million, or $1.01 a share, down from $158 million, or $1.52 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. </p><p>   Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings were $1.27 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $1.11 a share. </p><p>   Gross margin slipped, as the chain stepped up promotional activity and faced what it called modest supply-chain cost pressure. </p><p>   Heartened by its third-quarter performance, Foot Locker lifted its outlook for the year. It now expects annual sales to decline 4% to 5%, compared with its prior forecast for a 6% to 7% drop. Adjusted earnings are projected to reach $4.42 to $4.50 a share, an 11-cent jump from the midpoint of its previous guidance. </p><p>   Foot Locker's results come amid a mixed week of earnings from retailers ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. Macy's Inc. and Kohl's Corp. reported a drop in sales for their latest quarters as shoppers delayed their holiday purchases. Target Corp. said sales slowed, and it cut its outlook for the fourth quarter. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Walmart Inc. attracted more shoppers in its latest quarter, as its reputation for low prices attracted consumers feeling the effects of inflation. </p><p></p>",
