  "title": "DoorDash to Buy Finland Food-Delivery Startup in Deal Valued Above $8 Billion; Deal to acquire Wolt comes amid a wave of consolidation in the competitive food-delivery segment",
  "text": "<p>DoorDash said Wolt's co-founder and chief executive, Miki Kuusi, would lead DoorDash's overseas presence after the deal closes, which the companies expect in the first half of next year. Founded in 2014, Helsinki-based Wolt employs 4,000 people across 23 countries.</p><p>The merger sets up DoorDash, the biggest food-delivery app in the U.S., to compete with Uber Eats in Europe. DoorDash has increasingly sought to expand overseas after capturing a lion's share of its home market during the coronavirus pandemic. DoorDash expanded into Japan in this year's second quarter.</p><p>DoorDash shares advanced more than 3% in after-hours trading on the news.</p><p>San Francisco-based DoorDash announced the deal Tuesday in conjunction with third-quarter results. Revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 45% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, the company said, in line with the $1.18 billion average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>The pandemic made consumers more accustomed to ordering goods at the touch of a button, and DoorDash expanded into delivering everything from toothpaste to Tylenol and alcohol. It also expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed directly on the websites of retailers like Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc.</p><p>Although DoorDash hasn't posted an annual profit since its inception eight years ago, it was the only major U.S.-based food-delivery platform to turn a quarterly net profit last year during the pandemic.</p><p>Executives at DoorDash and Uber Eats have spent the past year testing ways to deliver long-term growth and profit.</p><p>DoorDash has been profitable on an adjusted basis before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization for more than a year, giving it more leeway to expand overseas and build new business verticals without attracting the kind of scrutiny that rival Uber drew after posting hefty losses along the way. The company's profit, by that measure, was $86 million in the latest quarter, on par with the prior year.</p><p>The company posted a $101 million net loss for the most recent quarter compared with a $43 million loss in the year-ago period.</p><p>DoorDash said it expects the value of orders placed on its app to be in a range of $10.3 billion to $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter. DoorDash earns revenue by taking a cut of these orders.</p><p>Write to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com</p><p>DoorDash to Buy Finland Food-Delivery Startup in Deal Valued Above $8 Billion</p>",
