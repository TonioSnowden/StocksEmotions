  "text": "<p>Bitcoin BTCUSD, ethereum ETHUSD and other cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the U.S. government and unlike the dollar DXY are not backed by the U.S. central bank.</p><p>It's not clear if there is a connection between Americans' trust in government and their interest in cryptocurrency, as Paul claims, but views of local and state government are near record lows, according to a&#xa0;recent Gallup survey. And only 39% of people trust the federal government, according to the same survey.</p><p>This is not the first time Paul has touted cryptocurrency — during his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, Paul's campaign accepted donations in bitcoin, in addition to donations in U.S. dollars.</p><p>In 2014, Paul said he would be more bullish on crypto if it was backed by stocks.</p><p>See also: Anthony Scaramucci is rooting for DWAC because he thinks it will keep Donald Trump from running in 2024</p><p>As crypto trading becomes more popular, companies are trying to capitalize on its interest — Walmart WMT has begun allowing shoppers to buy bitcoin at in-person kiosks, and Mastercard MA is set to announce bitcoin applications for banks and merchants, including wallets and bitcoin credit cards.</p><p>Bitcoin prices reachednearly $67,000 last week, a new high. The record came a day after the debut of the first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO.</p><p>Earlier in 2021, El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal currency — El Salvador also uses the U.S. dollar&#xa0;as legal tender.</p>",
