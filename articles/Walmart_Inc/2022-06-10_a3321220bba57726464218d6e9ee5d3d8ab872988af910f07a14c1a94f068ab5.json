Referencing that situation as a dust-up was irresponsible and negligent and I am sorry,\" Del Rio said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"I stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. I say that while also expressing my support as an American citizen for peaceful protest in our country.

Critics noted that the difference is that most of the protests against police brutality following Floyd's murder were peaceful and bringing attention to racial inequality, while the violent storming of the Capitol was intended to obstruct Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.</p><p>Several elected Democrats and and Republicans in leadership have also lamented the events of Jan. 6. President Joe Biden called the attack \"unprecedented assault\" on democracy. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the event a \"dark day for Congress and our country\" on the one-year anniversary of the mob storming the Capitol. And around the same time, fellow Republican Ted Cruz referred to Jan. 6, 2021 as \"a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol.\"</p><p>Read more: Mitch McConnell says the U.S. Capitol was 'stormed by criminals' on Jan. 6, 2021</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice has called the Jan. 6, 2021 incident an \"attack on the Capitol,\" and more than 840 defendants have been arrested in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia related to the obstruction of Congress. The attack caused approximately $1.5 million worth of damage, according to a May 2021 estimate from the Architect of the Capitol.
