  "text": "<p>As Halloween draws closer, many families are facing the difficult choice of whether to let their kids go out to collect candy during the pandemic.</p><p>“It's traditional, and its one of the funnest memories of childhood,” Erin Reid, a mother of three from Syracuse, N.Y., told MarketWatch. “The younger you are the more fun that holiday is. It's so cool, everything about it.”</p><p>See also: Rand Paul says crypto could become the reserve currency of the world if more people lose trust in government</p><p>Reid, 39, has two children who have outgrown trick-or-treating, but her youngest son Jaxx, 7, is at the age when kids usually like to go out to collect candy. Unfortunately, Jaxx was not allowed to go trick-or-treating last year over safety concerns surrounding the pandemic — the family opted for a small get-together instead.</p><p>“It was sad. I hate it, but that was better than him staying home,” Reid said.</p><p>See also: ‘I stand with Kyrie Irving': Sen.

We are going to take every precaution.”</p><p>Reid added that her trick-or-treating group will be small, and hoped “that parents just put candy out on the porch, that would be really great.”</p><p>She also added there is an individual in their home who is immunocompromised.</p><p>See also: Crypto complex recalls 1920s stock market with ‘rampant speculation, manipulation and theft,' says left-leaning think tank</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's “State of the Union” Sunday that it's an important time of year for children, so “go out there” and “enjoy it.”</p><p>Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week that trick-or-treating is safe, if done properly.</p><p>“If you're able to trick-or-treat outdoors, absolutely,” Walensky told CBS.</p><p>https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1442143367098290182The newest guidelines from the CDC about Halloween come as more Americans say they will up their Halloween-related spending this year.</p><p>Confirmed cases and hospitalizations of COVID-19 in the U.S. continued their recent steady decline on Monday, as the country looks to move past a July surge likely caused by the highly transmissible delta variant.</p><p>The&#xa0;CDC's vaccine tracker&#xa0;is showing that 185.5 million people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated, equivalent to about 56% of the population — that number has stayed relatively static for weeks.</p>",
