  "title": "S&P 500 Drops Into Bear-Market Territory; Stock Market Selloff Continues; All three major U.S. indexes poised to extend run of weeks in the red",
  "text": "<p>It has been decades since stocks have fallen for such a prolonged period. The Dow industrials are headed toward its eighth straight weekly loss, its longest such streak since 1932, near the height of the Great Depression. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are on course for their longest streak of weekly losses since 2001, after the dot-com bubble burst.</p><p>The driving force behind the selloff, investors say, is growing fears about the health of the U.S. and global economy. Money managers spent the first few months of the year worried that the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases would take a big toll on expensive stocks that had fueled the market's remarkable rally over the past several years. Investors fled shares of technology companies, pulling billions of dollars out of funds tracking the Nasdaq. Higher interest rates tend to dull the allure of companies that are hoping to deliver big profits years down the line.</p><p>This week, the pain spread well beyond the technology sector, alarming some investors. Major retailers reported their profits being hurt by rising costs and supply-chain disruptions, driving a selloff that led to Target and Walmart's worst one-day decline since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Shares of everything from banks to real-estate investment trusts to grocery store chains fell, too.</p><p>The ferocity of the selling sent investors and analysts a strong message: There are few, if any, safe parts of the stock market this year.</p><p>\"It's clear that in a very short period of time, we moved from a pandemic to an inflation scare to now, serious concerns about growth,\" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p>Until the Fed convinces investors it can tighten monetary policy and reel in inflation without tipping the U.S. economy into recession, it is unlikely markets will stabilize, analysts said.</p><p>\"We still need to build more evidence to convince markets that a soft landing is possible,\" said Arun Sai, a multiasset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, referring to the Fed's goal of slowing the economy enough to contain price pressures but not so much that it causes a recession.</p><p>Government bonds rallied Friday, benefiting from investors flocking toward assets that tend to perform well in times of economic stress. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury edged down on Friday to 2.785% from 2.854% on Thursday, heading for a third straight day of declines. Prices rise when yields fall.</p><p>Meanwhile, earnings drove outsize moves in some stocks.</p><p>Shares of Ross Stores slumped 22% after it posted a decline in sales and said it expects another drop this quarter. The retailer, like many other businesses, said its results were hurt by rising costs for transportation and labor.</p><p>Agricultural equipment maker Deere dropped 12% even though it posted higher sales and profit on strong demand. Its chief executive said supply-chain issues disrupted production levels and deliveries.</p><p>Most S&amp;P 500 companies have managed to produce earnings this quarter that have beaten expectations, said Kiran Ganesh, a multiasset strategist at UBS.</p><p>What's less clear is how companies will fare in the coming months.</p><p>\"The question is from the next quarter onward, where we will have the full impact of the jump in oil prices and the war in Ukraine,\" Mr. Ganesh said.</p><p>Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell about 5% to $28,734. The currency's price has fallen almost 58% since its November all-time high.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.7%. Asian stocks also rose, with the Shanghai Composite climbing 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumping 3%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500 Drops Into Bear-Market Territory; Stock Market Selloff Continues</p>",
