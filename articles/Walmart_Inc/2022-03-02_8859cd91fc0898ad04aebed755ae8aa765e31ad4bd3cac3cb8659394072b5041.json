  "text": "<p>EG Group, the petrol station company whose owners also control Asda, has told its investors for a third year running that it needs more time to produce audited accounts, citing the increased size and complexity of the business.</p> <p>The company, which has quickly grown into a sprawling empire through a series of debt-fuelled acquisitions, will request a waiver from bondholders so it can delay publishing the accounts, according to three people who attended an investor presentation. </p> <p>“It's basically a rinse and repeat of last year,” said one. Publishing audited financial statements within a prescribed period is a condition of most publicly traded debt issues. </p> <p>A three-page unaudited results statement issued by the group showed revenue for the year to December 2021 rising 23.5 per cent to $26.5bn and group cash profit of $1.45bn, 16.3 per cent ahead of the previous year. Net debt was $9.6bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>EG, owned by brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and the private equity group TDR Capital, also disclosed that it had not yet completed its annual review of goodwill impairment but intended to provide this in its annual report and accounts. </p> <p>TDR and the brothers agreed to buy Asda in 2020 and took control of the retailer last year. </p> <p>EG and its auditors KPMG cited difficulties caused by the pandemic when the release of audited results was delayed in 2021. </p> <p>One person close to the company said this year's delay was down to the knock-on effect of filing late last year, with auditors rushing to catch up. Another said there were capacity issues across the audit market. </p> <p>EG Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>KPMG, which took over as EG's auditor in 2020 after rival Deloitte resigned citing concerns about the group's governance, declined to comment because of client confidentiality.</p> <p>The delay comes as EG Group's owners <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d42a88a7-1c9c-43ce-add9-cbc60dc5d38e\">consider buying UK chemist chain Boots</a>, in what would be a multi-billion pound deal likely to require more debt issuance. </p> <p>The Issa brothers and TDR made early, non-binding bids last week in which they proposed two alternatives in which either the supermarket group or its owners could lead the buyout, one person close to the process said.</p> <p>In January EG received $237mn from being repaid in full with interest “in relation to the financial asset that it purchased” in the first three months of last year, it disclosed in its results this week. </p> <p>That refers to the Caffè Nero debt that the company snapped up as it attempted to buy the coffee chain, a person with knowledge of the matter said. </p> <p>During the year EG spent more than $700mn on acquisitions, including health-focused food chain Leon, KFC franchisee Amsric and Yorkshire-based bakery chain Cooplands as it sought to bolster its convenience and food-to-go operations.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley, Kaye Wiggins and Robert Smith in London 2022 'EG Group seeks audit delay for third year running' FT.com 2 March.
