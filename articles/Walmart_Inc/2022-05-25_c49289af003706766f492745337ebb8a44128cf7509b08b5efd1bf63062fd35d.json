  "title": "Business News:  Juneteenth Items  Spark a Backlash  ----  By Gareth Vipers",
  "text": "<p>   Walmart Inc. said it might remove some Juneteenth-related products from store shelves after a wave of social-media backlash that accused the retailer of inappropriately commercializing the holiday. </p><p>   \"Juneteenth holiday marks a commemoration and celebration of freedom and independence,\" Walmart said on Tuesday. \"However, we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate.\" </p><p>   The apology comes after social-media users posted images of Walmart's Juneteenth products in its stores, including the Great Value brand of Celebration Edition Juneteenth Ice Cream. Cartons of the red velvet cheesecake-flavored ice cream featured the red, yellow and green of the Pan-African flag and included the words \"Share and celebrate African-American culture, emancipation, and enduring hope.\" </p><p>   The company has a wider range of products in its stores commemorating the holiday, including decorations, clothing and books. </p><p>   Some people said Walmart selling certain products trivialized the June 19 holiday marking the end of slavery in the U.S. </p><p></p>",
