  "title": "Gloom Over Holiday Sales Looks Inflated; Americans may not be in good cheer about the economy, but robust retail sales data for October indicates they have their wallets open anyway",
  "text": "<p>Inflation did play some role in the sales gains, but even after taking it into account it looks as if people are buying more stuff. The report led many economists to revise their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates higher. JPMorgan Chase, for example, now forecasts GDP will grow at a 5% annual rate in the fourth quarter, versus its previous estimate of 4%.</p><p>The pickup in sales stands in contrast to surveys, such as the University of Michigan's, which show consumers have become downbeat. Ample savings and continued employment growth, it seems, can have more influence on how much people spend than how they feel about the world on any particular day.</p><p>The strength of sales in October also suggests that despite continuing supply-chain issues, holiday sales will be good. Walmart, for one, said on Tuesday that it has the inventory it needs to meet demand during what it expects to be a strong season.</p><p>There are still things to worry about. One is that retailers' pleading with people to get their holiday shopping done early, lest supplies run out, might have effectively pulled sales earlier. When it comes to consumers who adhere to a holiday spending budget, that may indeed be the case, but for many other people starting shopping early probably equates to buying more, as temptations to spend abound throughout the holiday season. Card spending figures suggest that so far this month, sales continue to do well.</p><p>Another concern is that while stores and other goods purveyors could do well over the holidays, services businesses might not have as much reason for merriment. Restaurant and bar sales were flat in October versus a month earlier, Tuesday's report showed, which might be an indication of how cooler weather is keeping diners away as outdoor seating arrangements become less comfortable.</p><p>Still, in contrast to last year, when rising Covid-19 cases among a completely unvaccinated population put a damper on holiday cheer, the backdrop is better. Indeed, some people might feel as if they have to make up for last year's muted celebration. For retailers, Christmas is looking anything but blue.</p><p>Gloom Over Holiday Sales Looks Inflated</p>",
