  "text": "<p>On Sept. 13, a number of news outlets reported that Walmart Inc. had entered into a “partnership” with litecoin to accept payments made using that cryptocurrency, citing a news release. That turned out to be false.</p><p>Litecoin rose in value by as much as 33% that day before ending with a 3% gain.</p><p>The event is a reminder to think before trading on what you read. Two red flags here: the notion of a “partnership” with a cryptocurrency as well as the idea that a company as large as Walmart would make such a bold move with a virtual currency that tends to fly under the radar (most attention and trading volume is focused on bitcoin and ether).</p><p>Mark DeCambre sheds more light on how cryptocurrencies can be exploited for financial fraud.</p><p>More on cryptocurrency markets:</p><p>Shiba Inu soars over 25% Friday as dogecoin copycat makes Coinbase debut</p><p>MicroStrategy buys more than 5,000 bitcoins in 3 weeks while it sells its own stock</p><p>NFTs have Cathie Wood excited: ‘This is how I felt when the internet came about'</p><p>AMC's deeper move into crypto cements Adam Aron as ‘King Silverback' of meme stocks</p><p>Billionaire Steve Cohen backs new cryptocurrency trading firm Radkl</p><p>More about cryptocurrencies' uncertain future</p><p>There are political rumblings surrounding cryptocurrencies, including questions from U.S. senators about how much authority the Securities and Exchange Commission has over virtual currencies. Even SEC Chairman Gary Gensler was uncertain, saying cryptocurrencies “may well be securities” during a Senate Banking Committee hearing this week.</p><p>The regulatory uncertainty was an important factor in a decision by Moody's Investor Service to initiate its debt-issuer rating of Coinbase Global Inc. at BB, which is a “noninvestment grade” or junk rating. Moody's assigned the low rating even while saying Coinbase's “financial profile suggests investment grade credit strength.”</p><p>More crypto concerns:</p><p>At end of the day, if bitcoin is successful governments will ‘kill it,' says Ray Dalio</p><p>‘If they are going to regulate it they better do it quickly,' says SkyBridge Capital's Scaramucci about crypto</p><p>Early signs of a housing slowdown</p><p>Getty Images/iStockphotoHome prices in many areas outside of major U.S. cities began to soar early in the coronavirus pandemic, with buyers often scrambling to outbid each other.

A yield of 1.38% on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes is hardly appealing, while an investment-grade corporate bonds index yield little more than 2%.</p><p>But there are exchange-traded funds with much higher yields that pay monthly while taking a relatively low-risk approach to investing in the stock market using this strategy.</p><p>It is not always a good idea to avoid taxes</p><p>Getty Images/iStockphotoAn investment adviser might suggest that you convert an individual retirement account to a Roth IRA to avoid a higher tax bill years down the line.
