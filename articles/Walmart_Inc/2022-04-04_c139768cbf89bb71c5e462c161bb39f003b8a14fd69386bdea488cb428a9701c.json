  "text": "<p>* Tappable: Tech Leaders Grapple With Expanded Roles</p><p>* At a Glance: The Environment for CIOs</p><p>How has the relationship between business and technology changed during the last 10 years?</p><p>Arvind Krishna, CEO, International Business Machines Corp.</p><p>I would say technology has gone from being a cost of doing business to one of the fundamental sources of competitive advantage. If I look at the sources of competitive advantage, 2,000 years ago it was physical resources. Then it was trading…the things you got from the land, gold, wheat, grain. Then it went to money. You then go to knowledge. Through the last century we talked about knowledge workers. Today, I think it's technology. I think tech is the fundamental source of competitive advantage today.</p><p>Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud</p><p>If you look at what has really fundamentally changed in technology, I would say it is the pervasiveness and speed with which new technology has been predominant. Part of it is the ease with which technology can now be adopted with many things being delivered, from computing as a service…Today everyone in the organization is a digital worker.</p><p>Martin Casado, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz</p><p>Ten years ago, if you started a software project, you really didn't know if you were going to complete it. It was more art than engineering. Certain people could do it and certain people couldn't, and it was hard to outsource. Now, with all of the tooling built around it, cloud, mobile, containers, all of these things…if you start a software project, it will almost certainly be completed, and it will be done better and faster than before. The question has moved from can you build it to how effective will it be.</p><p>Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer and chief development officer, Walmart Inc.</p><p>It was actually the creation of the cloud and distributed computing that…allowed us to get very powerful models. We can now collect and reason over the kinds of data that would have been unthinkable maybe about 10 years ago. And that has led to new capabilities…that couldn't have been possible, even just a few years ago.</p><p>Francesco Tinto, CIO, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.</p><p>More and more, we talk about new business models that become enabled by technology…how we create the experience for the user, the experience for the external customer, and more importantly, how we create value from the data…the combination of internal and external data, structured data and unstructured data.</p><p>Ron Guerrier, CIO, HP Inc.</p><p>Enterprise technology has become more distributed. In the past, we functioned in a homogenous environment where one system did everything, and now it's a combination of solutions. That's why it's important for CIOs to hire and cultivate talent who can connect the dots in a heterogenous model.</p><p>Alessandro Ventura, CIO and vice president of analytics and business services, Unilever North America</p><p>What has happened in the last couple of years has been the advent of platforms, and on these platforms you can create products in a more agile way, so they're a much more open ecosystem…You can get different software vendors to talk to each other. Integration is more turnkey.</p><p>Bill Braun, CIO, Chevron Corp.</p><p>The rapid, low-cost, highly capable sensors appearing everywhere on everything all the time…You can't buy a motor or a valve or anything anymore that doesn't have six different sensors on it. And so that data flow that's coming from the front edge of our business, and how to harness it…that's kind of like the Wild West to us. That's where you need the cloud. You need the compute. You need the AI to make sense of it.</p><p>Noelle Eder, Global CIO, Cigna Corp.</p><p>There's way more connectivity across companies, ecosystem to ecosystem now than there was 10 years ago. So this notion of sharing customers, sharing data, sharing experiences, and thinking of your technology environment as beyond the traditional borders, is dominant right now. You can see it show up from a risk-management standpoint in cybersecurity and supply chain. There's a lot of interdependency happening.</p><p>Atish Banerjea, CIO, Meta Platforms Inc.</p><p>Wherever there are big transformation programs that are happening in any sort of large enterprise today, you cannot really think of accomplishing that without the IT organization being the heart and center of it. As opposed to IT being a back-office function that was on the periphery, it has become the heart of how the company does almost anything, whether it's in the world of marketing or sales or finance. And that's a big change.</p><p>Ramon Richards, CIO, Fannie Mae</p><p>The CIO role today…is driven by a heightened focus on resiliency, information security, and data loss prevention. Businesses depend on technology as an integral part of how they operate and a key component for growth…As a result, the CIO will be responsible for highly reliable, resilient capabilities and partnering with chief information security officers and chief data officers to ensure preventative and detective controls are in place to protect technology assets from bad actors.</p><p>How have the roles of CIO and technology leader evolved?</p><p>Andreessen Horowitz's Mr. Casado</p><p>The CIO has become more, much more strategic. As a result, two big things happened. More and more is going under the CIO because more and more is digital. But as part of that, they also have to be on top of all the recent trends, which are changing faster than ever. I think at this point the role of the CIO is about understanding how large swaths of the company's business are going to be impacted by software in the next 10 years, rather than being about the purchasing of systems.</p><p>Google Cloud's Mr. Kurian</p><p>It's a great opportunity for CIOs. Technology adoption is becoming much easier so they can show value more quickly. The pandemic made it even more clear that technology is critical to differentiating how an organization [engages with] customers. And so the role of the CIO has changed materially because it allows them to adopt technology, work with the line of business leader and deliver transformation much more quickly than before. CIOs are not just managing a portfolio of applications…they are also building competency in software engineering, in areas like cybersecurity.</p><p>Jacqueline Guichelaar, CIO, Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>I would say it was becoming less technical to some extent, and the discussion around CIOs becoming more business oriented,…[as in] what are you actually doing for your customers? What are you doing for your business? The whole piece around keeping your team motivated from one challenge to the next while keeping the business running. We went from the pandemic, to responses to Russia-Ukraine. You're trying to hire and retain during the Great Resignation, and at the same time, we're re-engineering all of our systems. The CIO…is now the chief culture officer.</p><p>How has the CEO's relationship to the CIO changed?</p><p>IBM's Mr. Krishna</p><p>I think 10 years ago, many business leaders would feel perfectly competent to make a decision, and then the CIO would [execute it]. Now, even in my own process—I am a reasonable technologist—I would not make a decision without asking my CIO, \"What do you think? What does your team think? What do you and your team think is the best answer?\"</p><p>Ten years ago, we were all looking to optimize that [IT budget], squeeze it down by 10%. Now I actually don't care if you spend more, if that makes everyone else more productive. If you can do something that lets me scale revenue faster—because I can't hire more people, they just aren't available to hire—then that is incredibly useful and valuable. So the CIO is really a partner now, no longer the cost function that I have got to irritatingly pay heed to.</p><p>Google Cloud's Mr. Kurian</p><p>CEOs see that being a technology-enabled organization requires them to have some core competencies, and one of them is software development. And so we see CIOs also needing to build that long-term core competency and people capability.</p><p>How will enterprise technology and the role of the CIO change in the foreseeable future?</p><p>IBM's Mr. Krishna</p><p>Cybersecurity is the issue of the decade. I think that is the single biggest issue we all are going to face.</p><p>Walmart's Mr. Kumar</p><p>First, I think the capabilities of devices that are in people's hands…that is going to continue to have a very important, outsized impact on enterprise tech as a whole. The second thing is that these deep-learning models are going to get increasingly sophisticated. Enterprise tech is going to be deeply influenced by the ability to create these models and to be able to run compute and have intelligence at the edge.</p><p>HP's Mr. Guerrier</p><p>I expect the next generation of CIOs to be more diverse. Since the recent racial reckoning, many companies, including HP, recommitted themselves to advance diversity, equity and inclusion and launched goals to increase diverse representation. Setting measurable outcomes will lead to progress over time. As the CIO role becomes more strategic to the business and as our society becomes more heterogeneous, diversity will be increasingly important because it drives innovation and leads to business growth.</p><p>Matt Carey, CIO, Home Depot Inc.</p><p>Robotics is going to be key, as time goes on, and they become more and more mature. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in ways that actually enhance customers' experiences or associate experiences are going to be very key. The value of where we can apply technology to help save our customers time and money will be an important thing, no matter what business you're in.</p><p>Anil Bhatt, Global CIO, Anthem Inc.</p><p>The telehealth expansion with the focus on [augmented reality and virtual reality] is going to be very, very important.</p><p>Fred Killeen, vice president of global information technology and CIO, General Motors Co.</p><p>One of the key things for vehicle manufacturers is going from what, historically, has been a very physical process, building vehicles…to really moving to a full virtual process, which will speed the time to market.</p><p>Kathryn Guarini, CIO, IBM</p><p>Some technologies, including AI and blockchain, have been slower to drive change than they were predicted to. I think there's tremendous capabilities in both…in terms of real business impact. I think there's more to come. It's not any one entity that can deploy blockchain and have it be widely adopted. It requires both technology and business model changes that I think make it more challenging to drive. And I think quantum computing is going to emerge as being an essential component of enterprise technology…across industries like financial services, energy, utilities.</p><p>Reporting by Suman Bhattacharyya, Isabelle Bousquette, Tom Loftus, Angus Loten and Steven Rosenbush</p><p>Roundtable: The CIO in an Age of Disruption</p>",
