  "text": "<p>Dear readers, </p> <p>Railways have inspired a long history of extravagant forecasts. In the 1840s, UK promoters claimed new lines would carry four times as much traffic as the roads. When the bubble burst, shareholders —&#xa0; including the Brontë sisters and Charles Darwin —&#xa0; <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3573436-440b-11df-9235-00144feab49a\">lost heavily</a>.</p> <p>Jumping forward to the 21st century, scepticism is also required when considering projections used to justify HS2. This high-speed rail project is designed to speed up the links between London and cities in northern England. The&#xa0;UK government's economic case&#xa0;was always dubious. Repeated revisions of costs and benefits have made it even&#xa0;more so. The project <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4816829-2bd2-4652-ae8b-3d06a57c60e0\">fell apart</a> completely on Thursday when the government axed most of the planned line between the Midlands and Leeds.</p> <p>The political furore stirred up by the HS2 decision was not the only business issue bothering politicians this week. A planned sale of&#xa0;LV, one of the UK's oldest mutually owned life insurers, to private equity group Bain provoked widespread criticism. Bain's offer is fair. But it is losing the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d791656-247c-4989-a568-fc5c340cec75\">PR war</a> increasingly central to contentious UK takeovers. </p> <p>Sometimes it is better to walk away. Activist investor Elliott dodged a bullet after being outbid for US software company Riverbed in 2014. On Wednesday, Riverbed filed for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6393cf2-58c7-4fb5-957e-f24782775415\">bankruptcy protection</a>, laden with $2bn of debt and little profit. Buyout firms like software companies' predictable cash flows. But this example shows a high debt load leaves scant margin for errors. </p> <p>Elliott was also in the news after it disclosed a&#xa0;3 per cent stake in Europe's biggest supermarket group Ahold Delhaize. The hedge fund is renowned for its bruising challenges to management, but sensibly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ba1fcc-5d9d-4616-80eb-8bab920dfd61\">supports</a> Ahold's plans to carve out its online marketplace business Bol.com. The sale of a&#xa0; 20 per cent stake&#xa0;would free up cash that could be used to&#xa0;fend off new threats from meal delivery apps, grocery start-ups and Amazon. The online retail giant is expanding quickly in the US, Ahold's biggest&#xa0;market.</p> <p>Amazon's ambitions also pose&#xa0;a big challenge to Walmart, which is struggling with higher costs. The retailer has staged a remarkable <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f08eb96-9ef4-4851-9919-8426c0b47315\">recovery</a>. But the era of rising inflation means another reinvention is required.</p> <p>Amazon is also putting the squeeze on Visa. Ditching its credit cards in the UK sends a message to it and&#xa0;peer Mastercard that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af1fdbb6-bf89-4c6a-9c70-08a08648d958\">balance of power</a> is shifting. Their profitability is steep, with ebitda margins as high as 70 per cent. But the good times are coming to an end for one of business's most enduring duopolies.</p> <p>Paytm, a long-term Visa partner, also had a bad week. Its IPO, India's largest ever, flopped. The unprofitable company, which operates in a highly competitive market, was overpriced. The big stake held by China's Ant Group is an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da21a31a-7b4b-4067-93e3-b228285be0e0\">overhang</a>. Shares could have further yet to fall. </p> <p>When it comes to rich valuations, Tesla has few rivals. Its market value is twice that of JPMorgan Chase, which it is fighting in the courts. The argument is over the strike price of warrants that the bank bought in 2014 to help the electric vehicle company manage potential dilution from a convertible bond. Such a&#xa0;disagreement would normally be brushed under the carpet. But the breakdown in relations is not surprising,&#xa0; given the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2714225e-e7de-4957-b10f-ce5c52586ec1\">unpredictability</a> of Tesla. </p> <p>Not that US heavyweights such as JPMorgan have any difficulty seeing off challengers in their own market. One after another, European banks have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/669e6ad2-8b47-43c9-909d-faddc3213e95\">beating a retreat</a> from the US, bruised by tough competition and low interest rates. France's BNP Paribas is reportedly looking for a buyer for its US unit, Bank of the West, following similar moves by HSBC and Spain's BBVA.</p> <p>BBVA wants to spend some of the proceeds on gaining full ownership of Turkish lender Garanti. Though the deal looks inexpensive, it is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03251b66-a1f5-4d0c-92de-7b5a9a9d6a34\">gamble</a>. There is a&#xa0;risk of continuing&#xa0;value destruction as rampant inflation weakens the lira even further.</p> <p>For Turkey, the investment was a&#xa0;rare international show of confidence. Britain is far easier to pitch to foreign investors. As some of the uncertainty caused by Brexit and the pandemic fades, UK property is attracting overseas buyers. That is controversial in&#xa0;the case of homes. But the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a32f24a3-d87b-4ec5-95fa-19d715a0b53f\">issue</a> should not be exaggerated given that foreign ownership is below 1 per cent. &#xa0;</p> <p>Commercial real estate, by contrast, relied on overseas investors for half of investment last year. That interest should be sustained. Prime yields are significantly higher than for other European capitals. Though the work-from-home trend will limit demand for offices, it is not set to be as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c7d9031-b72d-44b6-9e2a-b363a8fffe98\">disruptive</a> to the office market as once thought. </p> <p>The return to the office may well mean more face time with the boss. If that is something to dread, consider&#xa0;the findings of&#xa0;a study linking earnings to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9f0ce45-73f4-4ffb-9cc1-e3ab66d1db69\">personality</a>. It found that meanness pays, though&#xa0;being outgoing or conscientious brings even bigger benefits.</p> <p>Money isn't&#xa0;everything, of course. Whatever your income prospects, have a safe and enjoyable weekend. </p> <p><strong>Vanessa Houlder</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Vanessa Houlder 2021 'Best of Lex: predictions, predations and promotions' FT.com 19 November.
