  "text": "<p>\"I'd call it a small spike,\" Steve Rendle, chief executive and president of Vans parent VF Corp., told analysts Friday on the company's second-quarter earnings call.</p><p>Mr. Rendle cautioned, however, that \"this is not a Vans annual event.</p><p>\"This . . . has helped raise some media attention that we'll leverage,\" he said, noting that the company will continue to build on its connection to pop culture.</p><p>The company will focus on \"things that we can control\" and on new products, Mr. Rendle said.</p><p>The Netflix show has become a global phenomenon since it premiered, hitting No. 1 in more than 90 countries, including the U.S.</p><p>For Netflix, \"Squid Game\" also serves as a source of merchandise. The streaming giant this month said it was teaming up with Walmart Inc. to create a digital storefront on the retailer's website that will offer merchandise tied to \"Squid Game\" and other hit shows.</p><p>Dressing up like the characters from the show has become a popular costume option for Halloween.</p><p>While the Vans brand got a boost from \"Squid Game\" in the latest quarter, it was still the weakest-performing brand when measured by revenue growth of those under VF's umbrella, which also includes the North Face, Timberland and Dickies.</p><p>Vans logged single-digit global revenue growth for the fiscal second quarter that ended last month, whereas revenue growth for the other three brands was all in the double digits.</p><p>Total revenue at VF rose 23% from the comparable quarter a year earlier to $3.2 billion. Profit jumped to $464.1 million, up from $256.7 million. Both revenue and adjusted earnings missed Wall Street's consensus estimates, according to FactSet.</p><p>The company saw product delays and reduced traffic into its stores during surges of Covid-19 cases weighing on its business, according to finance chief Matt Puckett.</p><p>\"Retailers remain bullish on the upcoming holiday season, and we are focused on delivering products in time to support strong demand signals,\" Mr. Puckett said.</p><p>Covid-19 lockdowns in VF's key sourcing countries have led to more manufacturing capacity constraints in its second quarter, the company said, with port congestion and other logistical challenges contributing to delays.</p><p>VF said it is expediting freight as needed, and that most of its supply chain is currently operating.</p><p>Shares of VF fell 4.5% on Friday, or $3.33, to $70.74.</p>",
