  "title": "After a Pandemic Pet Boom, Investors Should Fear Abandonment; Trupanion may be one of those stocks in line for a difficult post-pandemic adjustment as the pet craze abates",
  "text": "<p>The surge in impulse pet adoptions fueled by Covid-19 makes even extravagant Christmas seasons look morally unimpeachable. Almost 13 million households in the U.S. got an animal companion between March and December of 2020, the American Pet Products Association says. Spending on veterinary practices has shot up this year, according to analytics firm VetSuccess.</p><p>Sitting at the intersection between markets' obsession with growth stories and the vet boom is Seattle-based pet insurer Trupanion. Its shares have gained 250% in two years and trade at 13 times the firm's tangible book value—insurers usually hover around one—even though it has rarely turned a profit since its listing in 2014.</p><p>Only 1% of pets in the U.S. have medical insurance, compared with 30% in Sweden, 25% in the U.K. and 5% in France. Getting to French levels of coverage seems achievable, and it would expand Trupanion's addressable market from $1.3 billion to $6.7 billion. It isn't that Americans care less about their dogs and cats; they spend more on them per capita than anyone else. The problem is that Wall Street firms have traditionally seen pet insurance as a nice-to-have rather than a must-have, and priced it high while offering little.</p><p>Trupanion's subscription service has no coverage limits and has built a network of veterinary practices that accept payments directly from the insurer. That allows customers to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, even though it has proven controversial in the past, with the company receiving regulatory fines for aggressive marketing tactics, including rewarding a clinic for pushing its products.</p><p>Large marketing outlays—plus big stock-based compensation costs—mean the business doesn't make money. Of course, this is normal in a phase of expansion: Amazon.com's profits were paltry until 2016. Unlike at Amazon, however, gross margins at Trupanion have decreased as sales have jumped, because invoices kept pace with revenues.</p><p>Executives argue this is deliberate: They adjust expenses to target a level of operating profitability that returns to customers 70% of what they pay in premiums, adding more lifelong subscribers and years of steady future cash inflows. But the current retention rate of 99% would surely drop if coverage was less generous.</p><p>The investment case seems based on Trupanion being able to slash marketing costs at some point, allowing for some of its narrow gross profit margin of 13% to filter through to shareholders. Analysts are forecasting just that, according to Visible Alpha data: By 2030, they say, the cost of acquiring pets, which has more than doubled in five years, will stabilize at 130% of current levels without hurting retention. Net profit margins would be just below 5%.</p><p>While possible, it is optimistic. Trupanion has already narrowly undershot its own adjusted operating margin targets, and it competes with many incumbents that have now upped their game, as well as newcomers such as Zoetis and Walmart. Its subscription market share has recently plateaued, with the fastest growth coming from writing insurance on behalf of others—a low-profitability segment.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If you acquired a pandemic puppy or other pet, did you purchase insurance for them? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The company also says that data gathered from an expanding network and new business lines will generate efficiencies, but a raft of economic research suggests that in the insurance industry economies of scale are often underwhelming.</p><p>Investors need to question how much of Trupanion's sky-high valuation comes from providing the perfect combination of a growth and a pet narrative during the pandemic. Sadly, once the initial enthusiasm wears off, many people become insensitive to puppy eyes.</p><p>Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com</p><p>After a Pandemic Pet Boom, Investors Should Fear Abandonment</p>",
