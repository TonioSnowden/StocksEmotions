  "text": "<p>This week, FT Edit's deputy editor Hannah Rock has been fretting about renewing her mortgage. </p> <p>She wanted to understand why fixed mortgage rates in the UK are now over 6% when the Bank of England's interest rate is 2.25%. </p> <p>And she wanted to know what the turmoil over UK government borrowing since the “mini” Budget has to do with home loans. </p> <p>So she set out across the FT newsroom to consult our journalists and here is her account of what she found: </p> <h1>What's going on with mortgages? </h1> <p>I used to have recurring nightmares about&#xa0;tsunamis. Now I have them about my mortgage. </p> <p>My morning doom-scrolling has moved on from Covid and Ukraine to gilt yields and swap markets as I desperately try to figure out what is going on and whether I should simply sell up now and start fitting out a VW camper.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11302597.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Rates on two-year fixed mortgages in the UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0091bcdc-fbe8-4326-a66d-c6d391d1741e\">hit 6.46 per cent this week</a>, with five-year rates at 6.32 per cent. In the US, where it's more common for homebuyers to take out much longer deals, rates for a 30-year-fixed mortgage <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65572b7d-46e5-40ba-a59e-552802ee07c6\">have almost doubled</a> to 6.66 per cent.</p> <p>These rises came after central banks started raising interest rates to dampen inflation. But while the Bank of England and the Fed have hiked their rates rapidly, mortgage rates have risen even faster. </p> <p>So what is going on? Well, the first thing to note, according to the FT's banking and fintech correspondent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/siddharth-venkataramakrishnan\">Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan</a>, is that inflation seems to be harder for the central banks to tame than expected, so lots more interest rate rises are probably on the way. </p> <p>But in the UK, the markets have been in panic mode ever since the new prime minister Liz Truss, and her former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a huge package of tax cuts and energy bill reductions without saying how they would pay for them. </p> <p>As a result, says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/tommy-stubbington\">Tommy Stubbington</a>, capital markets correspondent, “people dumped gilts”, a fancy name for UK government bonds. The market reasoned that the government needed a tonne of money, so would start issuing lots more bonds. Investors started selling gilts in anticipation and it became <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e6b89a3-a63e-49df-8a04-0488b69e84f5\">a self-fulfilling prophecy</a>.</p> <p>As the value of UK gilts sank, their yield went up. This is the amount of money an investor receives for owning a bond as a percentage of its current price and the interest rate the government is paying. </p> <p>Unfortunately for mortgage borrowers, “all things are connected,” says Sid, including gilt yields and something called swaps. </p> <p>“The details of how these things work can make your head explode,” says Tommy. But in essence, while the central bank base rates tell you where interest rates are now, swaps are the “financial markets' best guess of where interest rates are going”. They track bond yields closely because both are, effectively, predictions about the same thing.</p> <p>In the world of swaps, your bank or lender agrees to swap interest payments with another financial institution. They might choose to swap for a fixed interest rate if they think rates will keep rising, or a floating rate if they think rates will fall. </p> <p>This is why, even with base rates at 2.25 per cent and 3-3.25 per cent in the UK and US respectively, mortgage rates are so much higher. “Banks are always trying to guess: ‘Is this going to be economical in two or five years?'” says Sid. </p> <p>With a click of his mouse, Tommy brings up a screen of ticker-tape numbers. The swap markets doing their work in real time. Their prediction? A UK base rate of 5.5 per cent and a US rate of 4.75 per cent by the middle of next year. </p> <p>Buckle up! It's time to load the camper van.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11395041.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h1>Our favourite pieces</h1> <p>• As a former Beijing correspondent, I remember covering the 18th Communist party congress in 2012 when Xi Jinping took over the leadership from Hu Jintao. Ten years on, and the biggest moment in China's political calendar begins again on Sunday. The FT's guide to what you can expect, and who is in and who is out, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74ef56a5-07f2-45bb-b151-eba0df32bf1c\">is a must-read</a> if you want to understand it all. <br><strong>Malcolm Moore</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalcolmMoore\"><em>(@malcolmmoore)</em></a> <br><em>Editor, FT Edit</em></p> <p>• Two pieces had me hooked this week, both on a similar theme: the trials and tribulations of trying to be a company with a conscience. It used to be that a business was there to serve its customers by selling the best product at the best price. These days, as Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson writes in his deep-dive about how <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0975d1e3-d95f-4b77-8d58-5d95a751f31a\">Walmart went woke</a>, they worry about “lightbulbs, refrigerants, soil erosion, systemic racism, plastic bags, gun violence, financial literacy, vaccine distribution, disaster preparedness, recidivism rates, cashew yields in Ghana and shark stocks in New Caledonia”. Over at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30efd993-8c23-4f1b-9385-132bbba3d863\">Ben &amp; Jerry's</a> you can add the Israel-Palestine conflict to that list, much to the alarm of parent company Unilever.
