  "text": "<p><br>Thousands of store workers at UK supermarket chain Wm Morrison have won the first round of their legal battle for equal pay.</p> <p>More than 2,300 Morrisons supermarket workers, most of them women, won an employment tribunal ruling on Tuesday that their roles can be compared to the jobs of colleagues in supermarket distribution centres.</p> <p>The ruling is important because the first step in an equal pay claim is often to establish whether jobs are comparable. It is not known if Morrisons will appeal the ruling.</p> <p>In the next stages of the case, judges must consider the legal questions of whether the two types of roles are of “equal value” and whether there is a reason — other than sex discrimination — for the two jobs not being paid the same. </p> <p>The supermarket workers are being represented by law firms Leigh Day and Roscoe Reid. </p> <p>UK retailers including Asda, J Sainsbury, Tesco, the Co-op and Next are all facing equal pay lawsuits and it has been estimated that equal pay claims brought by supermarket workers could cost the retail sector £10bn if the retailers eventually lose all their cases. &#xa0;</p> <p>This year, the UK's Supreme Court ruled in favour of 44,000 female supermarket workers in the first stage of their long-running equal pay claim against Asda. </p> <p>The court ruled that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db023ca7-d9a7-4912-8f5e-ca64aeaa4bf7\">Asda supermarket workers</a> could directly compare their roles to the pay of the mostly male staff who are employed at depots as part of Asda's distribution operation. The Asda workers still have to clear a number of legal hurdles to win compensation, which has been estimated at between £10,000 and £20,000 per employee. </p> <p>The Asda case is furthest advanced in the courts but lawyers said the cases could still take years to conclude. The supermarkets have argued that retail and distribution and logistics roles are fundamentally different and operate in very different environments.</p> <p>In June, thousands of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9d7e1b2-4bc9-4a65-b3e6-094d807b3737\">Tesco shop floor workers</a>, represented by Leigh Day, won a legal argument in their fight for equal pay when the European Court of Justice ruled that the “single source” test applied to businesses in the UK. This means a worker can compare their role to somebody working in a different part of the business if a single entity has the power to correct the pay gap.</p> <p>Emma Satyamurti, a partner in the employment team at Leigh Day, said: “This year has been a big one for supermarket equal pay claims, with this judgment following hot off the heels of the Asda Supreme Court ruling and the Tesco CJEU judgment.”</p> <p>Morrisons, which is the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1048786-60c3-4080-b2d5-b8da2b48a1d1\">private equity takeover battle</a>, said of the tribunal ruling: “The decision does not decide if retail and logistics roles are of equal value. Morrisons pays a fair day's wage for a fair day's work and will continue to fully defend these proceedings.”</p><p>Source: Jane Croft 2021 'Morrisons supermarket workers win first round in equal pay battle' FT.com 28 September.
