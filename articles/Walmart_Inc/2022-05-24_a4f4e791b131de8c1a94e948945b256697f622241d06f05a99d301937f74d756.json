  "title": "Walmart faces backlash over its Juneteenth-themed ice cream; The company apologized for releasing items connected to the holiday that 'caused concern'",
  "text": "<p>The ice cream isn't the only Juneteenth-themed item that Walmart is offering. Other products range from T-shirts to bottled water.</p><p>Juneteenth — June 19 — is the day that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. It became a federal holiday in 2021 and is slated to be observed this year on June 20, since June 19 falls on a Sunday.</p><p>In a statement released to some media outlets, Walmart said the \"Juneteenth holiday marks a celebration of freedom and independence. However, we received feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize. We are reviewing our assortment and will remove items as appropriate.\"</p><p>Walmart didn't immediately reply to a MarketWatch request for comment.</p><p>The response on social media to the rollout of the ice cream, particularly from the Black community, showed that many thought Walmart was trivializing the holiday by essentially commercializing it.</p><p>Others also pointed to the fact that Creamalicious, a Black-owned ice cream brand, already has a red velvet-cheesecake offering. They suggested that Walmart was copying the flavor concept when the company could have opted to sell the Creamalicious ice cream instead.</p><p>MarketWatch also reached out to Creamalicious for comment, but didn't receive an immediate response.</p><p>Walmart faces backlash over its Juneteenth-themed ice cream</p>",
