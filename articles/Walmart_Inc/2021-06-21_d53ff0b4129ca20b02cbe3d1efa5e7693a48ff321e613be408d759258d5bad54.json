  "text": "<p>   Mr. Biden may find some common ground with Republicans who, since Donald Trump's presidency, have become less enamored of free trade and other traditional business priorities. The Biden administration has already brought a complaint related to the treatment of workers and unions in Mexico under the provisions of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump negotiated with significant input from Democrats. </p><p>   So far, unions have played little direct role in the boost to worker leverage. Union membership in the private sector, at 6.3% in 2020, is trending near the lowest levels on records back to the 1970s, according to the Labor Department. Many of the businesses competing for less-educated workers aren't unionized. Workers at an Amazon center in Bessemer, Ala., voted not to form a union in April. </p><p>   William Spriggs, chief economist to the AFL-CIO, said unions' support for a $15 minimum wage and efforts to organize companies like Amazon deserve some credit for spurring change in low-wage workers' pay and conditions. </p><p>   Amazon said in May that it would hire 75,000 workers and offer $1,000 signing bonuses in some locations, while pledging to pay at least $15 an hour. McDonald's said recently that it wants to hire 10,000 employees at company-owned restaurants and raise pay at those locations. Walmart said it would raise wages for about 425,000 of its employees. </p><p>   Some smaller businesses are resigned to losing employees to better-paying competitors. Layne's Chicken Fingers restaurants have lost employees to Walmart, McDonald's and QuikTrip convenience stores, said CEO Garrett Reed. The Frisco, Texas, chain offers $11 or $12 an hour for entry-level jobs. </p><p>   Mr. Reed said he has pending deals to lease four locations in the Dallas area for restaurants. He is holding off on signing the leases because he worries he can't attract the needed workers, especially managers. </p><p>   \"There's only so much I can pay and remain profitable without raising prices too much,\" Mr. Reed said. He said he has elevated workers in their late teens and early 20s to general-manager positions paying over $50,000 a year. </p><p>   \"We're so thin at leadership that we can't stretch anymore to open more locations,\" he said. \"I've got a good crop of 16- and 17-year-olds, but I need another year or two to get them seasoned to run stores.\" </p><p></p>",
