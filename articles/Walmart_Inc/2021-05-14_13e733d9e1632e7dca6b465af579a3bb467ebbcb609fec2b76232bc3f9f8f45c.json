  "text": "<p>Hello from my London flat! This has been a busy week for the visual and data journalism team. As restrictions lift across the UK, we have updated our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272354f2-f970-4ae4-a8ae-848c4baf8f4a\">economic impact tracker</a>, which shows positive signs of recovery in some countries. Beyond the day-to-day work, I've been doing research for the FT's financial literacy charity. If you know any teachers in the UK who teach children aged 3-18, or you are one yourself, please feel free to <a href=\"https://survey.ft.com/jfe/form/SV_bplln6PsiEn53pA\">share this survey</a>.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy my pick of the week's stories, plus a few from elsewhere you shouldn't miss. <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/5a8d70c20bfc0e000429c348/subscribe/success\">Click here</a> if you'd like to receive Long Story Short by email every Friday.</p> <h1>1.&#xa0;Can AI decode facial expressions?</h1> <p>The story I've been most excited about this week is on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0b03d1d-f72f-48a8-b342-b4a926109452\">the “emotion business</a>”: how companies are cashing in on machine-learning to predict your feelings in real time. The <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/emotion-recognition/\">immersive interactive</a> lets readers play with — and judge — the technology for themselves. While there are lots of exciting applications, the technology — which reads facial expressions to determine your emotional state — can further cultural bias, be used by authoritarian governments for surveillance and propagate incorrect information. As one machine-learning scientist says:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“A machine . . . doesn't have ability to adjust in the moment if it misread what you said.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h1>2. ‘A competition for top of mind'</h1> <p>The battle over the $1.3tn US grocery market will shape how America shops in the future. As part of a new series on the future of retail, reporters Alistair Gray and Dave Lee delved into the battle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ab41b9e-a294-430f-951d-49cfc3415460\">between Walmart and Amazon</a> to dominate the sector, including the latter's experiments with brick-and-mortar outlets and the former's investment into driverless delivery to improve its “last mile” logistics. This comes after a year in which digital retail's share of the grocery market has tripled. As the chief executive of one ecommerce software company says:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“If [Walmart] cracks the digitisation of grocery, that's a huge opportunity for them to keep Amazon at bay.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h1>3. ‘People sleep better, they're less anxious'</h1> <p>Sarah O'Connor has rounded up some of the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fda3e7fd-8f46-4157-8bcf-bd5daac063cb\">fair workweek laws” in the US</a> — legislation that aims to make hours more predictable and fairly paid — and asks whether they are effective. While many sectors such as retail and fast food often employ “just-in-time” scheduling, this can cause stress for workers. New policies vary according to jurisdiction but generally require employers to give employees their schedules at least two weeks in advance. Studies show these laws are working for both sides.&#xa0;As one manager says:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“When you schedule willy-nilly . . . people just do the bare minimum. Just enough to not get fired.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h1>4.&#xa0;‘The mRNA hustler'</h1> <p>Is mRNA a one-hit medical wonder or the one we've been waiting for? While for decades scientists dismissed research into modified messenger RNA — the genetic material that acts like a courier for protein-building instructions in cells — it has become the vehicle for some of the most effective Covid-19 vaccines. This fascinating magazine piece details the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2978026-4bc2-439c-a561-a1972eeba940\">early trials and breakthroughs</a> that allowed the world to fight back against the pandemic and what mRNA could tackle next. Moderna's president says: </p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“What happens with the pandemic is that all of a sudden, a year forward, everyone believes in [mRNA] for all the rig</em>ht reasons.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>5.&#xa0;Such crypto, very joke, amaze</h1> <p>If you want a take on cryptocurrency from a writer who doesn't hold back, Alphaville reporter Jemima Kelly should be at the top of your list. This week, she's taken on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270\">dogecoin, the “joke” digital currency</a> that has surged 15,000 per cent since the start of the year (though by the time you read this, its value may be very different because of its high volatility). The conclusion is that while dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies are fun entertainment, crypto investment should not be taken so seriously: </p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“The digital coin is based on a meme showing the face of a Shiba Inu dog overlaid with an imaginary inner monologue.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>Quick hits</h2> <h4>OTHER FT STORIES THAT HAVE CAUGHT MY EYE THIS WEEK</h4> <ul>  <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3b021684-5e03-4215-9c39-44aef5c3c848\">rise and fall of billionaire financier Lex Greensill</a> is laid out in this video featuring six FT reporters who have been unravelling the web of businesspeople, politicians and companies involved in the saga. It does a great job simplifying a complex story around the biggest lobbying scandal in decades. </p></li>  <li><p>Longstanding tensions between <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be2cf535-8a93-486c-82fb-3995a19f839e\">Israel and Palestine escalated</a> this week, triggered by plans to evict Palestinians from their homes claimed by Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem. </p></li>  <li><p>Helen Barrett highlights two documentaries on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78aa7b69-3886-4a35-a040-4eae6466df51\">pioneering women in electronic music</a> — <em>Delia Derbyshire: The Myths and the Legendary Tapes</em> and <em>Sisters with Transistors.</em> I'm adding them to my list for the weekend.</p></li>  <li><p>Ahead of UK's national numeracy day next Wednesday, maths teacher and television quiz expert Bobby Seagull argues that the pandemic has shown us that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fb8583a-36ea-489c-831a-0c9fb94346bd\">numeracy skills have never been more important</a>. Having spent the past year working on our coronavirus trackers, I couldn't agree more!</p></li>  <li><p><strong>ICYMI</strong> This climate graphic smartly sets out how <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e025643a-c90f-4b07-ad08-01b81af5a4f0\">2030 emission targets by different countries</a> follow inconsistent parameters and are therefore difficult to compare. This data-driven slot is one I look forward to every week.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Best of the rest</h1> <h4>WHAT I'VE BEEN READING ELSEWHERE</h4> <ol>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/dining/h-mart.html\"><strong>The Lure of H Mart</strong></a> This read offered a touch of nostalgia for my homeland in the US. H Mart, the Asian grocery store chain, reported $1.5bn in sales last year, with 102 locations across the country. Having grown up in a midwest college town, where 94 per cent of the population was white when I was born, Asian grocery stores hold a special place in my heart. (The New York Times)</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://ampleroad.substack.com/p/these-losers-are-going-places\"><strong>These Losers are Going Places</strong></a> In this newsletter by writer Michelle Kuo, she discusses the emotions involved in moving back to a country her parents came from after years of trying to belong in the US. It shifted some of my own notions about my journey of moving countries as a child of immigrants. (A Broad and Ample Road)</p></li>  <li><p><strong>ICYMI </strong><a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.4/indigenous-affairs-education-land-grab-universities\"><strong>Land-grab universities</strong></a> This investigative story traced 11m acres of land in the US that were taken from tribal nations and sold to build up endowments at 52 American colleges. Make sure to check out the visualisations and interactive maps in the story, which was recently shortlisted for a data journalism award. (High Country News)</p></li> </ol> <h1>Before you go</h1> <p><strong>My data pick </strong>This graphic showing <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-up-and-moved-during-the-pandemic-heres-where-they-went-11620734566\">where Americans moved during the pandemic</a>, from the Wall Street Journal, reflects the stories I've heard anecdotally from friends back home. According to change of address forms filed with the US Postal Service, more than 7m households moved to a different county in 2020, half a million more than the previous year. Unsurprisingly, many left metropolitan cities for more affordable suburbs, midsize and small metro areas. As cities open back up, I'll be curious to see what this data looks like in the future.</p> <p>We always want to hear your thoughts and feedback, so drop me a line at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joannaskao\">@joannaskao</a> or email us at <a href=\"mailto:longstoryshort@ft.com\">longstoryshort@ft.com</a> — and have a great weekend</p> <p><strong>Joanna</strong><br><em>Visual and data journalism tech lead</em></p><p>Source: Joanna S Kao 2021 'A selection of the FT's biggest stories and best reads every Friday' FT.com 14 May.
