  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Walmart Drops Mask Rules For Vaccinated Workers",
  "text": "<p>In a memo to staff, Walmart said it would stop offering paid Covid-19-related sick leave next month, except when required by local governments. The policy gave hourly workers extra paid time off for Covid-19 illnesses, exposures or Covid-like symptoms, beyond their standard sick-leave pay.</p><p>It also will drop a daily health screening given to workers when they start a shift in all areas except a handful of states that require it. Unvaccinated workers must still wear masks, the memo said.</p><p>Walmart was one of the first big private employers to adopt a mask requirement in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic emerged. Walmart eased its mask requirements for vaccinated workers and shoppers in May 2021, but then reimposed the rule for some workers last July when the Delta variant caused a jump in infections.</p>",
