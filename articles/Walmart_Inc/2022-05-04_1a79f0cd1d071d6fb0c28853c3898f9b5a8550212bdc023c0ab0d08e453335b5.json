Walgreens plans to open doctors' offices at 600 or more of its locations by 2025.</p><p>The new executives, who were also named senior vice presidents, will start in their new roles this month and report to Tracey Brown, who joined the company last November as Walgreens' first president of retail products as well as its first chief customer officer.</p><p>Ms. Brown said the trio will help design products and services across the Walgreens business, evaluate which products and services will work best in which Walgreens locations and for which customer groups, and market the expanded healthcare offering.</p><p>New marketing chief Ms. Peters takes over the role from Patrick McLean, who left the company at the beginning of the year.
