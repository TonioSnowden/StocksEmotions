  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 index SPX rose 64 points, or 1.62%, to 4022.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 372 points or 1.1% at 33,909.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite climbed 261 points, or 2.3%, to 11,457.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 211 points, or 0.63%, to 33537, the S&amp;P 500 declined 36 points, or 0.89%, to 3957, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 127 points, or 1.12%, to 11196. The Nasdaq Composite is up 8.5% from its 2022 closing low hit on October 14, but remains down 28.4% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks rocketed higher on Tuesday morning after another batch of inflation data showed that whole prices rises were slowing in October for the second straight month.</p><p>The producer-price index climbed 8% over the 12 months through October, the Labor Department said Tuesday, easing from September's revised 8.4% increase. Last week, stocks surged after the October consumer-price index rose more slowly than expected.</p><p>Tuesday's PPI report helped support the notion that inflation has peaked, at least for now. </p><p> \"Bottom line, this data is further confirmation of the peak for now in inflation, evidence that we've been seeing for months. The question still unanswered is where does it settle out when all is said and done,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group.</p><p>In other news, the first face-to-face meeting between President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping helped support stocks listed in China and Hong Kong as some of the tensions between the world's two largest economies were seen to be easing.</p><p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng HK:HSI jumped 4.1%, taking its gains so far in November to 24.8%, as Chinese listed stocks shrugged off some soft retail sales data and welcomed signs of cooling U.S.-Sino tensions, along with signs that Beijing is preparing to support its beleaguered property sector. There were also more indications that the mainland government would ease COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>The upbeat tone from Asia — which included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TW:2330 jumping 7.8% on news Warren Buffett had boughta $5 billion stake — underpinned European bourses and U.S. futures.</p><p>\"The injection of optimism inserted into the limbs of the financial market after last week's U.S. CPI report showed some signs of fading yesterday although there's been a recovery in Asia as China continues to support the economy and the interpretation of Biden/Xi meeting yesterday is spun a bit more positively in Asia,\" said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Analysts increasingly expect stocks to enjoy a positive end to the year. \"The near-term picture still looks positive for U.S. benchmark indices and while momentum has reached intra-day overbought levels, this doesn't imply a selloff has to happen right away,\" said Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.</p><p>\"It still looks possible to gain further this week with targets up near SPX 4050-75 and larger targets up near 4120. While I do expect that recent gains will require some consolidation, this might hold off until late week ahead of a push higher post Thanksgiving into early December. Overall, last week's surge keeps trends positive near term,\" Newton added.</p><p>Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker added more fuel to the equity rally when he said early Tuesday that a 50 basis point hike in December would still be significant. Later in the morning, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr is set to testify on regulation at the Senate Banking Committee starting at 10 a.m. ET.</p><p>The Empire State manufacturing index for November showed a gauge of manufacturing activity in the state rose 13.6 points to 4.5 this month.</p><p>Finally, earnings from some of the largest retailers in the U.S. were released early Tuesday.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Walmart WMT shares jumped after the giant retailer swung to a net third-quarter loss, due to $3.3 billion in charges related to opioid legal settlements, but adjusted profit, revenue and same-store sales that were well above expectations and a full-year outlook that was above forecasts.</p><p>* Home Depot HD fell even after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, citing strength in project-related categories, but kept its full-year outlook intact.</p><p>U.S. stocks open at 2-month highs amid more signs of easing inflation</p>",
