  "title": "Don't Let Walmart's Slower Sales Fool You --- Retailer has ways to juice its bottom line",
  "text": "<p>The retailer had a standout holiday quarter. Net sales grew 7.4% in the quarter ended Jan. 31 compared with a year earlier. U.S. comparable sales grew 8.6%, far exceeding the 5.3% growth that analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. E-commerce sales grew 69% in the quarter. Yet Walmart shares fell almost 6% Thursday morning after results were announced and ended down 6.5%.</p><p>Two things may have weighed on investors. The company incurred a net loss of $2.1 billion and gave relatively muted guidance, saying that U.S. comparable sales would rise by a low-single-digit percentage this fiscal year compared with the 8.6% increase it saw for the last full fiscal year.</p><p>Neither is particularly worrisome. The loss is largely a result of charges related topreviously announced sales of foreign operations. As for the guidance numbers, growth was bound to slow after a bumper year. Before the pandemic, Walmart's U.S. comparable sales had been growing in the low-single-digit percentage range, if not declining, for the past decade. That has also been the case for other mature retailers such as Target and Kroger.</p><p>This means the real potential for a company like Walmart comes from how much more profit it can juice from a slow-growing revenue base. And things look promising on that front. Fueled by Walmart's e-commerce growth, advertising revenue nearly doubled last year and Walmart said Thursday that it should be a multibillion-dollar business in the near future. Morgan Stanley estimates that it could generate $4 billion of revenue and $2 billion of operating income by 2025. That would translate to roughly 9% of last fiscal year's operating income.</p><p>Walmart is a gigantic, reliable machine. It may not move fast, but even the small changes it is making today can alter the course of profitability dramatically.</p>",
