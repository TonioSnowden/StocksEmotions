  "text": "<p>    Walmart Inc. is seeking to hire a cryptocurrency expert, joining a growing number of companies looking to develop strategies for digital currencies such as bitcoin. </p><p>   The retailer posted a job for a digital-currency and cryptocurrency product lead based at its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. </p><p>   The hire would be expected to \"commit to a product roadmap and drive the project execution\" and serve as an expert on the job's subject matter, according to the posting. </p><p>   The job posting says the person it hires will \"identify customer needs and translate them into product requirements\" and that he or she will work with product and design teams. </p><p>   Amazon.com Inc. in July similarly posted an opening for an expert in digital currency. </p><p>   Walmart didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>    Bitcoin's daily trading volume and price began climbing in late July, even as traders face uncertainty over proposed tax regulations in Washington. </p><p>   Companies including Starbucks Corp. and Home DepotInc. accept cryptocurrency indirectly, through third-party applications that convert digital currency into dollars. </p><p>   Walmart is no stranger to blockchain, the technology behind the record-keeping system of cryptocurrencies. </p><p>   The retailer has used the technology to manage supply-chain data in a way that is simpler and more secure than the traditional array of bar codes, scanners, paper forms and individual databases. </p><p></p>",
