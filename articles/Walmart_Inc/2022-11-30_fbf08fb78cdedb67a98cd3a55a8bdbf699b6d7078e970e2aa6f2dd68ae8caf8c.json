  "text": "<p>\n  PENNSYLVANIA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  'Gasland' Fracker </p><p>\n  Pleads No Contest </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Natural-gas drilling company Coterra Energy Inc. pleaded no contest Tuesday to criminal charges related to the contamination of drinking water in a rural Pennsylvania town more than a decade ago. </p><p>\n  Coterra entered the plea in Susquehanna County Court, two years after the Pennsylvania attorney general charged its predecessor, Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp., with 15 criminal counts for allegedly causing flammable methane to leak from natural-gas wells into residential water supplies in Dimock, Pa. The company also agreed to pay $16.29 million for the construction of a new public water supply. The company will provide bottled water while the water system is under construction and pay water bills for between 18 and 20 homes for 75 years, according to prosecutors. </p><p>\n  Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said Coterra \"took full responsibility for the crimes Cabot committed.\" </p><p>\n  Dimock, a small community in the northeast corner of the state, gained national attention when the 2010 documentary \"Gasland\" showed residents lighting their tap water on fire. </p><p>\n  -- Kris Maher </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  VIRGINIA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Shooting Survivor </p><p>\n  Sues Walmart </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A Walmart store worker who survived a mass shooting last week filed a lawsuit against the company Tuesday claiming she complained about harassing behavior by the gunman two months ago. </p><p>\n  Donya Prioleau, 27, said she filed a formal written ethics complaint Sept. 10 about inappropriate remarks by the shooter, Andre Bing, including about her age and appearance, according to the suit. </p><p>\n  Ms. Prioleau says she was at the store last week and witnessed Bing shoot several of her colleagues, according to the suit. Bing killed six people and fatally shot himself. The suit, filed in Chesapeake Circuit Court, seeks $50 million in damages. </p><p>\n  A Walmart spokesman said the company is reviewing the complaint and will respond with the court. The company said it is conducting an investigation. </p><p>\n  -- Sarah Nassauer </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  HOUSTON </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Water Safe to Drink </p><p>\n  Again, Tests Show </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Houston said boiling water was no longer required after lab tests showed the city's water was safe to drink. </p><p>\n  The city on Tuesday lifted a boil-water notice that went into effect Sunday after a power outage at a water-purification plant caused the city's water pressure to drop. Low water pressure could lead to contaminants entering the water system. City officials said they never saw any indication the system was compromised. </p><p>\n  \"The water is safe to drink, brush your teeth, etc.,\" Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, said Tuesday in a tweet. </p><p>\n  Houston schools were closed for a second consecutive day on Tuesday. School officials said that logistical challenges caused by the boil-water notice prevented the district from being able to provide meals for its students and ensure safe water. </p><p>\n  -- Joseph De Avila </p><p></p>",
