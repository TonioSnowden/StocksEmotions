  "text": "<p>The companies argued that they had tried to stop pills from being illegally diverted and followed procedures required by federal and state regulators. They said others were to blame in the crisis -- and that the counties had failed to show that the pharmacies played a major role in the epidemic.</p><p>The verdict, delivered after a six-week trial, came in a bellwether case that was closely watched by attorneys elsewhere. Similar cases across the country continue to play out against pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, but Tuesday's verdict was the first against deep-pocketed pharmacy chains.</p><p>Bellwether cases typically don't carry precedential weight, but are often used by lawyers on similar cases around the country as a guidepost for settlement talks.</p><p>All three companies said they planned to appeal, arguing that Ohio's public-nuisance law had been incorrectly applied in the case.</p><p>The jury assessed only liability in the case. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who oversaw the trial, will determine how much the companies must pay to address the public nuisance created in the counties.</p><p>Plaintiffs' attorneys said they would be seeking damages of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for the two counties.</p><p>Michael DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS Health Corp., said the company strongly disagreed with the verdict. \"Pharmacists fill legal prescriptions written by DEA-licensed doctors who prescribe legal, FDA-approved substances to treat actual patients in need,\" he said.</p><p>Walmart Inc. said, \"Plaintiffs' attorneys sued Walmart in search of deep pockets while ignoring the real causes of the opioid crisis -- such as pill mill doctors, illegal drugs, and regulators asleep at the switch.\"</p><p>A spokesman for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said the court erred in allowing the case to go before a jury.</p><p>Shares of the three companies, which operate thousands of pharmacies, were little changed in Tuesday trading.</p><p>Although judges in opioid cases in Oklahoma and California recently issued judgments against plaintiffs' public-nuisance claims in cases involving drugmakers, some legal experts said it was difficult to say whether the Ohio case could meet a similar fate on appeal. Public-nuisance laws also vary by state.</p><p>\"The public-nuisance theory in general is pretty novel and untested as it applies to the sale of controlled substances,\" said Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia.</p><p>Judge Polster has consolidated suits filed by more than 3,000 communities against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies and chosen some cases as bellwethers.</p><p>Lawyers for the counties had argued that the pharmacies were the last line of defense to prevent the spread of addiction in the communities.</p><p>Defense attorneys had countered by saying the companies tried to stop pills from being illegally diverted and that others were to blame for the crisis.</p><p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs hailed Tuesday's verdict.</p><p>\"For decades, pharmacy chains have watched as the pills flowing out of their doors cause harm and failed to take action as required by law,\" said lawyers for the plaintiffs in a joint statement.</p><p>Two other chains, Rite Aid and Giant Eagle, previously reached settlements with the two counties. The companies had denied wrongdoing.</p><p>More than 80 million opioid pills were shipped to Trumbull County, with a population of less than 200,000, from 2006 to 2012, according to government data. More than 60 million opioid pills were shipped to Lake County, with a population of about 230,000, over that time.</p><p>The opioid crisis has triggered myriad lawsuits by states, local governments, and others against players in the pharmaceutical industry. The lawsuits allege drugmakers pushed their painkillers for uses far beyond what was medically necessary and that distributors and pharmacies didn't do enough to halt masses of pills from flowing into communities.</p><p>In July, states unveiled a $26 billion settlement with drug companies to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits. The nation's three largest drug distributors -- McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp., and Cardinal Health Inc. -- and drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson negotiated the deal for more than two years.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned a $465 million opioid-related judgment against J&amp;J. The court found that the state's public-nuisance law didn't apply to \"manufacturing, marketing and the selling of prescription opioids.\"</p><p>Opioids were involved in more than 70% of the nearly 841,000 drug overdose deaths since 1999, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>",
