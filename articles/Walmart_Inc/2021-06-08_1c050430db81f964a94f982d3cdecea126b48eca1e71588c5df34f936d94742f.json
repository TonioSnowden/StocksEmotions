  "text": "<p>A few years ago, I witnessed a small but spirited protest while lining up to buy a magazine at King's Cross station in London. A woman in front of me gestured towards a self-checkout kiosk and declared: “I will <em>not</em> talk to that <em>machine</em>.”</p> <p>Most of us can relate. Self-checkout machines can be dehumanising and using them comes with the inescapable sense that you're putting someone out of a job — if not today, then at some point in the future.</p> <p>How does the woman I saw at King's Cross feel about self-checkouts today, I wonder? Coronavirus has shifted our perspective. Automation may now stand for cleanliness, safety and speed. Getting in and out with your goods as quickly as possible, avoiding as many people as you can. Or, even better, ordering it from home. Even as vaccination rates rise, some of these habits will&#xa0;endure.</p> <p>“The desire to avoid interpersonal face-to-face contact is a really new feature,” says the Brookings Institution's Mark Muro, who studies consumer attitudes around technology. “It may be that face-to-face service becomes an elite luxury good.”</p> <p>Businesses have adapted fast. In September, Walmart, America's largest employer, introduced a new store layout plan, touting its effectiveness in limiting “contact between associates and customers”. Through its kerbside pick-up service, it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1b11c8-200c-4f7c-a431-6460f90bb95d\">experimenting with robotic systems</a> that can grab goods off specially-built shelves faster than any human.</p> <p>Restaurants are changing too. Chipotle introduced a new design for its outlets and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/chipotle-invests-in-softbank-backed-driverless-delivery-startup-nuro.html\">invested in a driverless delivery start-up</a>. In New York's Times Square, Taco Bell opened its first digital-only location in the US, with minimal front-of-house staff.</p> <p>In many cases, the pandemic has simply accelerated existing plans to reduce the presence of human workers in retail. Perhaps the most advanced effort has come from Amazon. Its Amazon Go stores (Amazon Fresh in the UK) use a system of overhead cameras and shelf-weight monitors to track when you've picked up an item, charging your account automatically after you leave. Amazon is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-store-technology-idUSKBN20W0OD\">licensing this checkout-free technology</a>, named “Just Walk Out”, to other retailers.</p> <p>Many of these innovations still rely on staff to run smoothly, but it is hard to avoid the sense that humans are being pushed into the margins, such as the workers who step in to correct machines when they falter or the cooks employed in the growing number of “dark” stores and kitchens that satisfy the huge demand from food delivery&#xa0;apps.</p> <p>Perhaps the best argument for increased automation is that some of the positions we stand to lose are monotonous, physically exhausting, low-status roles. We&#xa0;should be glad to hand these over to machines.</p> <p>Others will point out that these innovations create new jobs, which they undoubtedly do — though unevenly. Seegrid, a maker of autonomous forklift trucks in Pittsburgh, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/19/automation-labor-economy/\">told The Washington Post</a> its revenues had doubled during the pandemic. Ominous for those in the forklift truck-driving business, but a good omen for those in automation. The company said it is set to increase its workforce from 150 to 350 by year's end.</p> <p>Amazon defends itself against accusations that its efforts will put people out of work by pointing to its rapidly expanding workforce — half a million new workers signed on in the past year — and its investments in educational programmes for the “new” jobs, such as computer vision engineering and cloud computing.</p> <p>Such initiatives help. But what sets this revolution apart from others in human history is the speed at which the changes are expected to be felt. In its Future of Work report, published in February, McKinsey estimated that some 17 million US workers would need to transition to new jobs by 2030, having revised its pre-Covid-19 projections up by a quarter.</p> <p>Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia noted current labour shortages would provide companies with an added incentive to invest in pandemic-proof machines rather than bring back staff on higher wages. Such a pattern would follow a trend of automation investment that has come in the wake of previous recessions, raising the spectre of a “jobless recovery”, where demand for the work returns but the human becomes less sought-after.</p> <p>The researchers urged governments to intervene, to provide a safety net for those displaced by automation and support for the transition to a new way of working. Resistance feels increasingly futile.</p> <p><em>Dave Lee is the FT's San Francisco correspondent</em></p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Dave Lee 2021 'Why robot checkouts are on the rise in the age of Covid' FT.com 8 June.
