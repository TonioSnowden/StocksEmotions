  "text": "<p>The stock AMZN dropped 1.9% in afternoon trading, reversing an intraday gain of as much as 2.4% earlier in the session.</p><p>With the stock down 6.9% for the week, it was headed for an eighth-straight weekly decline. That would be the longest weekly losing streak since the 10-week stretch through the week ended March 7, 2008.</p><p>The stock has been hit hard by growing investor concerns over retailer earnings, due to rising inflation and slowing demand, coupled with increasing freight and delivery costs. Those concerns were exacerbated this week by hugely disappointing earnings reports from Amazon rivals Walmart Inc. WMT and Target Corp. TGT</p><p>Read more about NY Gov.
