  "text": "<p>Clayton, Dubilier and Rice plans to appoint Sir Terry Leahy as chair of supermarket group Wm Morrison after winning the £10bn takeover battle for the UK grocer, said two people briefed on the private equity firm's plans.</p> <p>Leahy, who was chief executive of UK grocery market leader Tesco for more than a decade, has been a senior adviser to CD&amp;R since he left the supermarket group in 2011. The firm edged out rival bidder Fortress Investment <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d990b0f-2728-4126-adee-d4111aae7a45\">by just a penny a share</a> in an auction process run by the UK's takeover regulator on Saturday.</p> <p>“There are very strong indications he will become chair,” said one of the people. “It will follow a similar model to B&amp;M,” he added, referring to the discount retailer that Leahy chaired <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9488ed6-c762-328a-8e23-63bba8b3b33e\">for five years</a> after CD&amp;R acquired a majority stake in it in 2012.</p> <p>“I would expect him to be an involved non-executive chair,” said another person, adding that CD&amp;R's usual modus operandi at investee companies was to establish a board with a mix of internal and external appointees.</p> <p>Leahy's expertise in buying and marketing is viewed as particularly complementary to the skills of Morrisons' chief executive Dave Potts, who is known for his organisational skills and attention to detail. </p> <p>Leahy, 65, is also a director of Motor Fuel Group, the CD&amp;R-owned petrol station chain that is expected to feature in any expansion of Morrisons' convenience store business.</p> <p>Morrisons' existing non-executives, including chair Andrew Higginson and senior independent director Rooney Anand, will step down once the deal has completed in late October, having orchestrated a bidding war when the price rose from an initial 230p a share to almost 290p.</p> <p>The takeover still needs to secure approval by shareholders at a meeting set for October 19. Columbia Threadneedle, one of Morrisons' biggest shareholders with a stake of about 8 per cent, signalled late on Saturday that it would accept the offer.</p> <p>Potts' team will continue to run the business day to day. In its offer documentation, CD&amp;R stressed it was “committed to supporting the existing team” which had “built the differentiated customer proposition and excellent in-store execution that define the business today”.</p> <p>“CD&amp;R will support Morrisons in further building on these strengths as [it] has successfully done with a number of its portfolio companies over the years.”</p> <p>CD&amp;R, Leahy and Morrisons all declined to comment. </p> <p>Many analysts had assumed that Potts, who is 64 and has run Morrisons since 2015, would have stepped down this year or next if it had remained a public company, with chief operating officer Trevor Strain the most obvious internal candidate to replace him.</p> <p>It is less clear how and when this succession might now play out. Those who know him say Potts had been reinvigorated by the challenges of the pandemic. Morrisons' responses to it, especially in the first few months when it launched new initiatives such as boxed grocery deliveries, were widely praised.</p> <p>Another complicating factor is the situation at Asda, where Roger Burnley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/163d92fa-d227-4877-8554-406ee0fa0335\">quit as chief executive</a> in August following its takeover by TDR Capital and the Issa brothers earlier in the year.</p> <p>The company is looking for a replacement and running the UK's third-largest grocer is on paper an attractive opportunity for the likes of Strain and other senior executives at rival supermarkets — especially given that the most likely internal candidates at Asda <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91f30cc3-5b73-495d-8978-a875628f1c3c\">have all left</a>. </p> <p>But those familiar with the company say Mohsin Issa is spending more time at its Leeds headquarters and becoming more involved with decision-making, raising questions about how much independence an incoming chief executive might have.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Leahy lined up to become Morrisons chair after takeover' FT.com 3 October.
