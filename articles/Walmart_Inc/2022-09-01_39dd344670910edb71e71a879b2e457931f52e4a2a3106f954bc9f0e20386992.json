  "title": "Xinjiang Rights Report Ratchets Up Standoff Between the U.S. and China; Beijing denounces U.N. report that alleges possible crimes against humanity for China's treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities",
  "text": "<p>His remarks echoed a statement issued earlier in the day by China's Permanent Mission to the U.N. in Geneva, which denounced the U.N. report as a \"politicized document that disregards facts\" and \"uses disinformation and lies fabricated by anti-China forces as its main sources.\"</p><p>The propaganda department of China's Communist Party has instructed state media to portray the U.N. report as a concoction of anti-China forces, according to people familiar with the matter. Foreign diplomats say China would likely marshal a full response on the international stage, such as by mobilizing friendly governments to support its positions at major forums, including at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, which is due to convene this month.</p><p>The 46-page U.N. report, published Wednesday, said China's government may have committed crimes against humanity in its treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang—an assessment that broadly supports critical findings by Western governments, human-rights groups and media detailing mass abuses in the region.</p><p>Researchers have in recent years documented a far-reaching Communist Party campaign in Xinjiang to forcibly assimilate Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, in an effort to impose stability in a region once racked by ethnic violence and sometimes deadly attacks against symbols of Beijing's authority. These efforts included the use of mass-internment camps for political indoctrination, the imposition of strict birth controls and restrictions on religious practices, as well as policies that resulted in forced labor and family separations.</p><p>In its Wednesday report, the U.N. rights agency assessed that serious human rights violations have been committed in the course of the Chinese government's efforts to combat terrorism and extremism, and that its use of arbitrary and discriminatory detention \"may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.\"</p><p>It wasn't clear what the U.N. rights agency or other related bodies might do to follow up on the report, which the agency has said doesn't represent a formal investigation. The agency's top office—the high commissioner for human rights—is vacant after the latest incumbent, Michelle Bachelet, stepped down at the end of Wednesday.</p><p>The U.N. hasn't announced Ms. Bachelet's successor, the choice of which—diplomats and activists say—could affect how the report contributes to continuing international efforts to press China on its rights record. Rights watchdogs have urged the U.N. to use the report as the impetus for creating a formal inquiry to investigate human-rights violations in Xinjiang and punish the perpetrators.</p><p>\"This is pretty much the first time that a highly independent, multilateral institution has said that Beijing is perpetrating significant human-rights violations,\" said Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. \"This report is significant ammunition in the hands of Western nations that seek to hold China accountable at the U.N.\"</p><p>Ms. Bachelet, who took office as high commissioner in September 2018, has led a yearslong effort by the U.N. rights agency to assess claims of rampant abuses in Xinjiang. She pledged to issue the findings in a report, which became a matter of contention as Beijing lobbied against its publication, while U.S. officials and rights activists accused the U.N. of delaying its release.</p><p>The report was released just minutes before midnight in Geneva, where the rights agency is based, on the final day of Ms. Bachelet's four-year term. She said in June that she wouldn't seek a second term.</p><p>The Chinese government, which reviewed the report ahead of publication, responded with denunciations that reiterated its official position on Xinjiang—that the Communist Party's policies in the region are reasonable responses to the threats of terrorism and religious extremism, and succeeded in restoring stability and economic development.</p><p>Beijing has mounted an extensive lobbying campaign on Xinjiang issues over recent years, including efforts to influence discussions at the U.N. Human Rights Council and persuading Muslim-majority countries to speak in support of China. Last week, Ms. Bachelet told reporters that she had come under heavy pressure to not issue the Xinjiang report.</p><p>The report could be discussed at the U.N. Human Rights Council when it holds its next regular session from Sept. 12 to Oct. 7. China currently holds a seat on the 47-member council, and its term expires next year.</p><p>\"It is time for the U.N. Human Rights Council to set up an independent international mechanism to investigate\" rights abuses in Xinjiang, Agnès Callamard, secretary-general of rights watchdog Amnesty International, said in a statement after Ms. Bachelet's report was published. \"All member states have a moral obligation to support proposals to discuss the report and establish an investigatory mechanism, or else be left on the wrong side of history.\"</p><p>Beijing, which has long insisted that it upholds an international system centered on the United Nations, sought to draw a distinction between the broader organization and one of its highest-profile agencies. Mr. Wang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Thursday that the U.N. human-rights office's actions and its Xinjiang assessment \"don't represent the United Nations at all, let alone the international community.\"</p><p>A formal U.N.-backed investigation would present the stiffest diplomatic challenge to date against Beijing's defense of its actions in Xinjiang.</p><p>The U.S. State Department and lawmakers in Canada, the U.K., and France have argued that China's actions in Xinjiang amount to a form of genocide—a label that wasn't used in the U.N. report published Wednesday. China has denied any rights abuses in Xinjiang and denounced the genocide allegations as \"the lie of the century.\"</p><p>The International Criminal Court based in The Hague decided not to investigate allegations of abuse in Xinjiang in 2020, citing its lack of jurisdiction. Beijing decided against ratifying the treaty that established the court decades ago.</p><p>Some researchers argue that the U.N. assessment's findings are robust enough to withstand any Chinese attempt to undermine them. \"The report is very conservative and very methodical\" in its use of Chinese government documents, as well as the conclusions it draws from them, said Mr. Zenz, the U.S.-based fellow, who came to prominence as one of the first researchers to examine rights abuses in Xinjiang using official data and papers. \"That is the report's strength, which makes it very hard to refute for Beijing.\"</p><p>Some activists and diplomats say the timing of the report's release may have been chosen for political reasons. By publishing it just before stepping down as the U.N.'s top human-rights advocate, Ms. Bachelet avoided having to personally manage the fallout with Beijing, while potentially giving her successor a relatively clean slate for future engagements with the Chinese government.</p><p>The U.N. rights agency didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In Wednesday's report, the agency recommended that businesses take \"all possible measures\" to ensure respect for human rights, including conducting due diligence in a transparent manner and assessing the risks that their products and services may contribute to rights abuses.</p><p>The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Thursday that the U.N. report could prompt fresh scrutiny by Western governments and consumers for foreign businesses to demonstrate their supply chains and operations in Xinjiang are free from forced labor practices. This adds to existing challenges facing European corporations such as high reputational risks and the inability to conduct independent, third-party audits in Xinjiang, the chamber said in a statement.</p><p>Several U.S. multinationals including Intel Corp. and Walmart Inc. have already tried to distance themselves from the region in the run-up to a U.S. law effectively banning all goods imported from Xinjiang.</p><p>The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act presumes all goods made in the region or by entities connected to the local government there were made with forced labor and blocks these items. The law went into effect in June.</p><p>Some prominent multinationals have come under scrutiny for their business links in Xinjiang. German car maker Volkswagen AG runs a car assembly plant with its Chinese joint-venture partner in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. Tesla Inc. opened a car dealership in Urumqi in January.</p><p>Volkswagen said it was seriously concerned about the findings in the report. It said all employees at the Xinjiang plant were employed by the Chinese joint venture, and they found no evidence that the staff were forced to work there. Tesla didn't reply to a request for comment.</p><p>In Wednesday's report, the U.N. said there were indications that labor and employment schemes in Xinjiang involved elements of coercion, and there was an \"urgent need for further clarification\" by Chinese officials about the use of \"vocational education and training centers\"—Beijing's label for mass internment camps—and their links with work.</p><p>Liza Lin in Singapore and Qianwei Zhang in Beijing contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Xinjiang Rights Report Ratchets Up Standoff Between the U.S. and China</p>",
