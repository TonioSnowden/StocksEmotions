  "text": "<p>Joe Biden and Xi Jinping held <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a066d8bd-5aee-4445-936f-d61518a2dcbe\">extensive talks about Taiwan</a> in a virtual meeting yesterday but failed to establish any “guardrails” to ensure that tensions over the island do not escalate into a dangerous conflict.</p> <p>The US president opened the three-hour meeting by telling his Chinese counterpart that they had to ensure competition between the powers did “not veer into conflict”. But the two leaders failed to reach agreement or find any way to ease tensions over Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.</p> <p>Taiwan has evolved into a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/231df882-6667-4145-bc92-d1a54bccf333\">flashpoint</a>&#xa0;as China increasingly flies fighter jets and bombers into its air defence identification zone.</p> <p>China has suggested that Biden was weakening the “one-China” policy, under which the US has recognised Beijing as the sole seat of government since the countries normalised relations in 1979. Biden has made policy changes that have made it easier for US officials to engage with Taiwanese counterparts.</p> <p>Xi warned Biden that advocates of Taiwan independence and anyone supporting them were “playing with fire” and would “burn themselves”, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency.</p> <p>Biden wanted to hold an in-person summit but Xi has not left China for almost two years because of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p><em>Thank you for reading FirstFT Americas.
