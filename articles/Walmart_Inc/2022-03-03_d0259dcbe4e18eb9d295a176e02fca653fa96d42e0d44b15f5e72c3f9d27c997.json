  "title": "Amazon to shutter its 4-star, Books, and Pop Up stores to focus on grocery, Go and fashion",
  "text": "<p>“We've decided to close our Amazon 4-star, Books, and Pop Up stores, and focus more on our Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go, and Amazon Style stores and our Just Walk Out technology,” a spokesperson for the e-commerce giant said in a statement.</p><p>“We remain committed to building great, long-term physical retail experiences and technologies, and we're working closely with our affected employees to help them find new roles within Amazon.”</p><p>Amazon AMZN store workers who choose to leave the company will receive severance.</p><p>There will be a total of 66 closures in the U.S. and two in the U.K. Final opening dates will vary by location.</p><p>See:Target stock soars after record profit with more growth ahead</p><p>And: Walmart's advertising business soars 130% to reach $2.1 billion</p><p>While these stores are closing, the company is investing in other stores, including the Amazon Style store, coming to the Los Angeles area; a larger Amazon Go store in Washington state, which will incorporate Just Walk Out technology; and two additional Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go. The first Starbucks SBUX Pickup with Amazon Go opened in New York City in November 2021.</p><p>There will also be more than a dozen new Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. and U.K.</p><p>Stores have taken on renewed significance in retail, becoming vital parts of the purchase fulfillment and customer service efforts of chains like Target Corp. TGT, Walmart Inc. WMT and many others.</p><p>But GlobalData says these Amazon stores had issues.</p><p>“They were designed for people to pop in and browse rather than as destinations where people would head on a mission to buy something,” wrote Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData.</p><p>“Ultimately, this wasn't great for driving footfall – especially in an era where people are visiting shops less. The other issue is the assortment which, in many outlets, was disjoined and unfocused.”</p><p>Moreover, the stores didn't have the same customer benefits that many others have these days.</p><p>“Interestingly, other than some payment technologies, Amazon never really connected its stores an online in the way that many retailers have done,” the note said.</p><p>“Options to order online and pickup from stores, or check stock levels before heading out, were non-existent. This, in our view, was a lost opportunity.”</p><p>Amazon stock is up 1.2% over the past year while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has gained nearly 15%.</p><p>More: Target to test Starbucks orders and merchandise returns at curbside pickup</p>",
