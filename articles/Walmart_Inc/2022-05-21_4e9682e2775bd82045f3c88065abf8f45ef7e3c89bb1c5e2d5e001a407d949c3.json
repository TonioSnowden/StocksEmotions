  "text": "<p>\n  SPIRIT AIRLINES INC. </p><p>\n  SAVE +13% </p><p>\n  A hostile takeover for Spirit Airlines is taking flight. JetBlue Airways Corp. said Monday it is appealing directly to the discount carrier's shareholders by launching a tender offer for their shares, after Spirit rejected JetBlue's $3.6 billion bid in favor of an existing deal with Frontier Group Holdings Inc. The Spirit board on Thursday urged shareholders to reject the bid over concerns that a deal with JetBlue would be blocked by antitrust regulators. Spirit shareholders are set to vote June 10 on whether to accept the Frontier deal, which would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline. Spirit jumped 13% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  MCDONALD'S CORP. </p><p>\n  MCD -0.4% </p><p>\n  The Golden Arches are leaving Russia. McDonald's said on Monday it would sell its business there, ending more than three decades in the country over its invasion of Ukraine. The fast-food giant said in March it would temporarily close its 847 restaurants in Russia while continuing to pay the 62,000 people it employs there. On Thursday, the company said it agreed to sell its Russian business to existing licensee Alexander Govor, who operates 25 restaurants in Siberia. Mr. Govor will now operate McDonald's entire Russian restaurant portfolio under a new brand. McDonald's shares slipped 0.4% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WALMART INC. </p><p>\n  WMT -11% </p><p>\n  Inflation is denting big-box retailers. Walmart said Tuesday that higher product, supply-chain and employee costs ate into its quarterly profit. The next day rival Target Corp. posted weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and said it would rather absorb higher costs than raise prices. Investors dumped shares of both, as inflation holds close to its highest level in four decades. Walmart shares lost 11% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  APPLE INC. </p><p>\n  AAPL -5.6% </p><p>\n  Covid cases and worker complaints took a bite out of Apple's return-to-work plans. The iPhone maker on Tuesday paused plans to start bringing employees back to the office an extra day a week, sticking with two days back each week for now. Apple had been gradually increasing the number of days in the office as it rolled out its hybrid work plans. The pause comes amid an increase in Covid-19 cases in the San Francisco area and complaints from some workers over the proposed increase. Some have left the company over its effort to gather in person more. Apple shares fell 5.6% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  PFIZER INC. </p><p>\n  PFE +1.3% </p><p>\n  More kids are now eligible for Pfizer's booster shot. The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday cleared Pfizer and BioNTech SE's Covid-19 booster for 5- to 11-year-olds, expanding access to the extra shot to about 28 million children. The decision permits a third dose of the shot at least five months after the second dose. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that children in the age group receive the booster, paving the way for pharmacies, doctors and other vaccination sites to begin making the shots available. Pfizer shares added 1.3% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  NETFLIX INC. </p><p>\n  NFLX -7% </p><p>\n  More bad news for Netflix. The streaming giant said it is cutting about 150 employees in a new round of layoffs as it grapples with slowing revenue growth and a shrinking subscriber base. The job cuts make up about 2% of Netflix's total workforce. A company spokeswoman said most of the employees being laid off are based in the U.S., and that the layoffs were based primarily on business needs rather than individual performance. The announcement follows the company's first subscriber loss on a quarterly basis in over a decade. Netflix shares fell 7% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  FORD MOTOR CO. </p><p>\n  F +0.6% </p><p>\n  Ford recalled thousands of SUVs because their engines may catch fire. The auto maker on Thursday recalled about 39,000 vehicles, including its 2021 Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs built between late 2020 and early 2021. Ford advised owners to park outside and away from structures after receiving reports of under-the-hood fires while the vehicles were parked and off. The auto industry is confronting a wave of such reports, many of them in electric models where the blaze is suspected to stem from battery defects. Ford shares rose 0.6% Thursday. </p><p></p>",
