  "title": "Retail Earnings Drive Stock Market Decline; Disappointing first-quarter results for Target, Walmart send shares of several major retailers lower",
  "text": "<p>Shares of retailer Target sank 24% after the company posted quarterly earnings that missed analysts' expectations, hurt by supply-chain costs and inflationary pressures. If such a fall holds through the trading day, it would mark the worst day for the company's share performance since the October 1987 market crash.</p><p>Walmart shares declined 5.7%, extending Tuesday's 11% drop after the retailer reported that it is getting squeezed by higher food prices and other rising costs. Shares of Dollar Tree Inc. fell 17% while Dollar General Corp. lost 12%. Shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. declined 11%.</p><p>\"We're seeing a continued shift in the composition of consumption, moving away from goods and back toward services,\" said Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. \"Naturally, that's going to weigh on these goods retailers.\"</p><p>Consumer staples and consumer discretionary were the worst-performing sectors Wednesday, down 4.3% and 4.2%, respectively.</p><p>Stocks have largely fallen in recent weeks as investors contemplated the global economic outlook, central banks' plans to tame inflation, geopolitical tensions and China's zero-Covid strategy. The culmination of factors has boosted volatility in markets. Even with Tuesday's rally, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 16% this year.</p><p>At the forefront of investors' minds is decades-high inflation in the U.S., how much policy makers are willing to tighten financial conditions to subdue it and what that means for economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday the central bank's resolve in combating inflation shouldn't be questioned, even if it requires pushing up unemployment.</p><p>\"Our expectation is that growth will start to slow down over the next few months,\" said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International, adding that he anticipates that the Fed's actions will help curb inflation. \"Then the next step for the Fed will be to focus on the growth shock.\"</p><p>The mix of concerns hitting markets has led Mr. Ahmed to adopt a more cautious investment approach in recent weeks, he said.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring whether Russia's war against Ukraine could further bolster geopolitical tension. Finland and Sweden formally applied for NATO membership on Wednesday, a move that, if approved, would fundamentally transform the security landscape of Northern Europe.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.938% from 2.969% Tuesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, fell 1.2% to $110.57 a barrel. Oil prices have been highly reactive in recent months to both Russia's war against Ukraine, which could disrupt supplies, and lockdowns in major Chinese cities that sap demand. Shanghai's government has begun preparing the city for reopening.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 declined 0.7%. The British pound fell about 0.6% against the dollar after fresh figures showed that U.K. annual inflation reached a four-decade high of 9% in April as higher energy prices fed through households' utility bills.</p><p>In Asia, new data showed that Japan's economy contracted in the first three months of this year, when restrictions related to a resurgence of Covid-19 infections held back consumer spending. Despite that, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.9% higher.</p><p>South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng each added 0.2% Wednesday. China's Shanghai Composite declined about 0.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Retail Earnings Drive Stock Market Decline</p>",
