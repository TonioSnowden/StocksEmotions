However, the funds were allocated to countries roughly in proportion to their share of the global economy, meaning low-income nations received just $21bn of the total.</p> <p>Oxfam said the amount was “nowhere near enough” and urged developed countries to “channel their SDRs” to address the “massive gulf” between them and their poorer counterparts. The IMF itself has previously said low-income countries needed <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/04/07/sp-fostering-a-fair-recovery\">$450bn over the next five years</a> to fund their recovery from the crisis.</p> <p>The most visible disparity between rich and poorer countries — highlighted by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a539196-22cd-4d99-8a58-6a258ec1225f#post-71c54a7c-a43c-4bff-b4bc-030364ae2d86\">Asian Development Bank</a> report calculating that the pandemic has pushed up to 80m people in the region into extreme poverty — has been the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84269839-1236-4ef7-ad30-9261f6126553\">“terrible inequity”</a> in vaccine distribution. The situation has been heightened by the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus and has prompted renewed calls for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66adc278-7191-4b8b-a0fc-b33e915d4631\">intellectual property rules</a> around vaccines to be relaxed — a move resisted by the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, proposals by some countries such as the US and UK to offer vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9125c02b-ecaa-4bf3-820e-67ff65155ccb#post-c8a3ea4a-12ab-4137-b6f2-715a5c10728f\">booster shots</a> — a move bolstered by new research showing the effectiveness of some vaccines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a539196-22cd-4d99-8a58-6a258ec1225f#post-4980e608-8db6-4b2f-a538-850fb3621130\">wanes within six months</a> — have been slammed by the World Health Organization, which called for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9125c02b-ecaa-4bf3-820e-67ff65155ccb#post-c1d4e3fb-5c04-4db7-a8a9-5b2244ccff98\">two-month moratorium</a> on supplementary doses amid fears of shortages in poorer countries being exacerbated.</p> <p>WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for urgent action to combat this “vaccine injustice”. Of the 4.8bn doses delivered globally, 75 per cent have gone to just 12 countries, he said yesterday.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>Business confidence in <strong>Germany</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09f7d2fe-44e6-4f1f-abe5-5a17b75570ad\">fell for the second consecutive month</a> in August as supply chain problems and Covid-19 fears hit the eurozone's largest economy, with concerns growing in hospitality and tourism. The fall in the Ifo index reflects similar findings in the Zew index and this week's PMI survey.</p> <p>US president Joe Biden's <strong>$3.5tn domestic spending</strong> proposals have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35409788-f5f3-466e-9095-ab0a55ff98b2\">edged forward</a> in Congress. Biden has pledged to address longstanding structural problems in the US economy and make recovery from the pandemic more even.</p> <p>Hotel groups in <strong>Spain</strong> are offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a539196-22cd-4d99-8a58-6a258ec1225f#post-2eaba489-ba2c-4083-bb04-51bf0a2af7e5\">discounts of up to 35 per cent</a> in a bid to attract tourists to take early autumn holidays, when Covid-19 vaccination programmes will be further advanced. They are keen to attract visitors from Germany and other European countries, where foreign travel restrictions have been eased, to offset the steep drop in British tourists.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Clipper Logistics</strong>, which manages supply chains for Asos, John Lewis and Asda, reported a 31 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to £28.8m in the year to April, as online shopping in the UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4caacb7d-28fa-4295-8d3a-ef812da50040\">surged during the pandemic</a>. The “e-tail” boom has been one of the few bright spots for the British economy.<br><br>The decision by the US Food and Drug Administration to grant full approval to the <strong>BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 jab</strong> has spurred American companies to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed019a6-903f-4cfc-aaa1-777f00fa148a\">demand their staff are vaccinated</a> before returning to the office. Goldman Sachs said vaccination would be mandatory from September 7 while similar announcements were issued by Deloitte and CVS Health.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the unexpected winners from the pandemic has been the <strong>plastic surgery industry</strong> as homeworking and isolation made people less self-conscious about post-surgery recovery. Private equity group Bain Capital announced on Wednesday that it had sold its controlling stake in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30e12a0a-8b90-418a-8a15-c326cd582295\">South Korea's leading Botox maker</a> to a consortium of investors for $1.5bn.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><strong>Hedge funds</strong> that profit from distressed companies are enjoying a bumper year as the stimulus-driven rally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74c50d58-d46e-4c1f-b806-3725ec7581fb\">lifts the price of debt</a> that had been near default, highlighting the speed of corporate recovery from the pandemic. Borrowing costs for companies have dropped across the board, even helping severely-stricken industries such as cruise lines, air carriers and hotel groups raise billions to tide them over. </p> <p><br><strong>David Giroux</strong>, a top active fund manager at T Rowe Price, has retreated from US equities, highlighting investor fears that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67142c8b-d4f2-4eef-9d34-1f66da3cb5c2\">stocks are being over valued</a> since their rebound from pandemic lows. The blue-chip US S&amp;P 500 index has risen by nearly a fifth this year, reaching a new all-time peak this week.</p> <p>Is there really a link between <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> prices and US Covid-19 cases? FT Alphaville reporter Jemima Kelly casts an eye over some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aef6cba4-1c94-4b9a-a4b3-329077b72dea\">rather dubious claims</a> and serious crimes against charts. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>Paul Hope</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09b8b6aa-c545-4499-a615-d256cfa4e62e?commentID=1a7dd9c5-2003-4799-ae5c-3e072faf8ce3\">US gig workers carry on the fight for rights as jobless aid comes to an end</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Gig workers are in a vulnerable position. As the work has low barriers to entry and requires easy skills, there's steep competition. Once in a pay cheque to pay cheque gig work cycle, there's little way up or out. Organising for better conditions is the only way “up”. On the other hand, the companies that profit from gig work do so largely through regulatory arbitrage and the disruption of previously organised systems to support and sustain workers ie Uber disrupting taxi cab cartels. <br><br>It's quite bleak. Especially because these companies are not profitable, they have become a way for capital to flush out worker protections by loss-leading platform gig work to greater market share. But there's no market equilibrium in sight. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>The pandemic has changed not only how we do our jobs but also the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6677ddac-3f25-485a-8bc1-d4c000f467f8\">clothing we do them in</a>. But the result will not be the relaxed utopia that clothes-haters expect, argues US financial commentator and style guru Robert Armstrong: “There is a reason that kids are happier in schools that require uniforms (though they may deny it) — it's one less thing to worry about. Freedom will turn out to be a lot of work.”</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Developed countries urged to help poorer nations fight Covid' FT.com 25 August.
