Top sellers included Pok√©mon cards, Legos, and Hot Wheels among toys, Apple MacBooks and AirPods among tech items, smart TVs and air fryers, the firm said.</p><p>Heading into the holiday season, consumers showed signs of restrained spending on some items as the price of food, gas and other productsremained elevated.

Join the conversation below.</p><p>Spending is still happening, said NRF President Matthew Shay on a call with reporters Tuesday, as many people give priority to holiday celebrations and unemployment is still low. People have done roughly half of their holiday shopping so far based on surveys, Mr. Shay said. \"There certainly is a recognition and concern about prices and inflation and yet people are still out spending,\" he said.</p><p>Shoppers spent an average of $325.44 on holiday purchases over the weekend, up about 8% from 2021, the NRF said. U.S. consumer prices in October were up about 7.7% from the same month a year ago, a slowdown from June when inflation hit the highest level in four decades, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>Online spending grew at a slower pace over Black Friday weekend compared with last year as some shoppers favored bricks-and-mortar stores. Online sales on Black Friday rose 2.3% to $9.12 billion, according to Adobe. On Thanksgiving people spent $5.3 billion online, up 2.9% from the holiday last year, data show.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Black Friday Weekend Drew Millions of Shoppers Back to Stores</p>",
