  "text": "<p>One started as a yeast delivery business around Tyneside in the north of England, the other as a seller of deli-style sandwiches in London. But Greggs and Pret A Manger — major rivals for a share of the UK's lunchtime spending — now find themselves fighting an increasingly tough battle for customers after a year that has upended the takeaway food market.</p> <p>With commuters forced to work from home for most of the past 14 months and city centre footfall dwindling to record lows, Greggs and Pret have had to compensate for a drastic lack of people looking for a quick lunch. Both have slashed staff, taken out loans and trialled or sped up development of new revenue streams, from selling frozen goods in supermarkets to hot dinners via delivery. </p> <p>The rapid adaptation of their business models during the pandemic shows the severity of the challenge that fast-food operators have faced and how operations may need to permanently change.</p> <p>Pano Christou, Pret's chief executive, described the effort as a “tectonic shift”. “Pret relied on customers coming to our stores and that was it,” he said. Today, his motto is “take Pret to the people”.</p> <p>In September, facing uncertainty over how quickly consumers would return, Pret launched a £20 monthly coffee subscription that has pushed digital sales to 40 per cent of its total. One adviser to food retail businesses described it as “a gateway drug” to Pret. “That repeat visit is very valuable,” they said.</p> <p>The chain also started to trial click-and-collect services from eight of its Manchester shops this week, ahead of a nationwide rollout, and now sells coffee on Amazon and frozen croissants in Tesco and Sainsbury's.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Greggs, which began to pursue an “omnichannel” approach before the pandemic, has expanded at-home delivery to 800 of its 2,078 shops, increased its range in Iceland supermarkets and will launch a new app in the second quarter of this year. It has also signed a deal for concessions in Tesco stores after an initial trial with Asda in February 2020. </p> <p>Pret opened its first concession in Kensington Tesco this month with Peterborough Tesco likely to follow, according to job adverts on its website. Both companies have agreed deals to open sites in motorway services and petrol station forecourts.</p> <p>“Greggs is there to be available when someone has left the house for another reason,” said chief executive Roger Whiteside. “One place people will always go, in my opinion, is the big supermarket.”</p> <p>From their respective starts — Greggs 82 years ago and Pret in 1986 — both brands have been driven by a need to sell easy food to passers-by, but they have different customer bases. Pret, whose first store was in Hampstead, London, catered to the urban white-collar commuter market selling fresh salads and sandwiches with ingredients such as prosciutto and crayfish.</p> <p>Greggs was a bakery initially, only later entering the takeaway food market with affordable pastries, doughnuts and bacon rolls. </p> <p>Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, described the Newcastle-based chain as “a sugar and salt-laden brand that has been revitalised under the leadership of Roger Whiteside into something of a hip national treasure”. The launch of Greggs' vegan sausage roll in 2019 shot the chain to nationwide fame and it upgraded profits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c4e1b2c-0459-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd\">four times</a> that year.</p> <p>Thanks to its central London focus, the pandemic has been less kind to Pret, which was forced to seek <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fefb6bf4-ceb6-46fb-8db8-49fc7d34dc37\">emergency funding</a> from banks in April last year and subsequently received £185m in extra capital from its owner, the Luxembourg based consumer goods group JAB. </p> <p>Greggs has been cushioned by its wider distribution of stores on high streets around the UK. In December, it repaid a £100m government-backed loan and last month said it expected profits to be almost double analyst consensus estimates this year and to return to near-2019 levels.</p> <p>Yet the crisis has forced both into markets where they might not have expected to overlap. Pret, which has never offered “meal deals”, said it was now considering discount offers, while Whiteside said that Greggs had accelerated plans to compete more as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fb6d73a-5d24-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98\">coffee shop</a> with seats. Both have pushed into the delivery and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8368776-f377-4462-a2fc-cfe31544104d\">hot dinner</a> market, with Pret offering mac 'n' cheese and Greggs selling pizza via the likes of Deliveroo and Just Eat, although Christou said that dinners are likely to be something Pret puts on a backburner while it focuses on recovering its core lunchtime trade.</p> <p>Both have also made changes to their plans for new sites. Pret had almost three-quarters of its 420 shops in London before the crisis but is now looking for shops in northern England, where Christou says the chain has had “really strong resilient sales”.</p> <p>“It's always been about being where your customer is . . . [but] all the things that would have contributed to strength pre-pandemic have changed,” said Erin Brookes, managing director of corporate transformation at Alvarez &amp; Marsal, which advised Pret during the pandemic. “Airports are pretty empty and the city has a whole different distribution.”</p> <p>Greggs, meanwhile, is encroaching on traditional Pret turf with openings at Canary Wharf, Greenwich and St Pancras in London. A radical reset of rents in the capital has made previously unaffordable sites a more attractive proposition. It is aiming for at least six more sites in central London as part of plans to reach a total of 3,000 shops during the next 10 years.</p> <p>Pret is likely to face the greater challenge as the two businesses emerge from the crisis, said Simon Stenning, a consultant who has worked for hospitality brands including Pret and Hilton. It must maintain its freshly made, premium cachet while broadening its range and competing with its cheaper northern rival.</p> <p>“[Greggs] has been pushing upwards with a quality coffee and food offer and is almost coming up to meet Pret,” Stenning said. However, he added that Pret “will fight tooth and nail” to retain the standards that it is known for: “Pano has worked at Pret for 20 years. He knows what is at Pret's core.”</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock 2021 'Pret A Manger vs Greggs: who will win the battle for lunch?' FT.com 4 June.
