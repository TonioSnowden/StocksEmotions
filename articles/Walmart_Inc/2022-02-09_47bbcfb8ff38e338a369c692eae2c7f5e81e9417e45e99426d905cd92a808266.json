  "text": "<p>Ilya Lichtenstein, 34 years old, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, were arrested without incident Tuesday morning in Manhattan, the department said. They have promoted themselves on social media as entrepreneurs with deep knowledge of tech and a love of travel.</p><p>According to court documents, the suspects allegedly conspired to launder nearly 120,000 bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex's platform in 2016 after a hacker breached the exchange's systems and initiated more than 2,000 unauthorized transactions. The transactions funneled the stolen bitcoin to a digital wallet being controlled by Mr. Lichtenstein, federal prosecutors said.</p><p>\"Today's arrests, and the department's largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,\" said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \"In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions.\"</p><p>At the couple's appearance in Manhattan court Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman set bond at $5 million for Mr. Lichtenstein and $3 million for Ms. Morgan, requiring that their parents' homes be posted as security. The judge also ordered that they not have devices with internet access and prohibited them from conducting cryptocurrency transactions.</p><p>Anirudh Bansal, a lawyer for Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan, told the judge that his clients had been aware of the government's investigation since November and hadn't tried to flee the country. Mr. Bansal declined to comment further.</p><p>Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan face charges relating to conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. They weren't charged with carrying out the hack of Bitfinex. The Justice Department's investigation is ongoing, officials said.</p><p>Hong Kong-based digital-currency exchange Bitfinex said it was hacked in 2016, causing the price of bitcoin to sharply drop. At the time, the value of the stolen bitcoin was valued at around $70 million, officials said.</p><p>Bitcoin, like many virtual currencies, can fluctuate wildly in price and has soared enormously since 2016. The $3.6 billion recovered by the Justice Department is the value of the bitcoin at the time of seizure, which occurred last week, officials said. Overall the current value of the stolen bitcoin linked to the hack is valued today at about $4.5 billion, officials said, but only about 94,000 of the roughly 119,754 stolen bitcoin were recovered.</p><p>Bitcoin is a popular type of so-called cryptocurrency, a kind of digital currency that exists as open-source computer code and that is maintained by the operations of a vast world-wide network of computers. Officials said the fact that blockchain -- the inalterable ledger that records bitcoin transactions -- is public was helpful in their investigation.</p><p>The Justice Department created a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team last October to prosecute criminals that rely on cryptocurrency and recover illicit proceeds.</p><p>Last year, authorities were able to claw back about $2.3 million in bitcoin that was paid by Colonial Pipeline Co. to a Russian ransomware gang that hacked the major conduit.</p><p>The couple arrested Tuesday, Mr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Morgan, used their laundered proceeds to purchase a variety of goods and assets, including gold, nonfungible tokens and Walmart gift cards, officials said. Only a small portion of the stolen money had been spent by the time of their arrest, according to officials.</p><p>The couple is believed to have access to $330 million in bitcoin that the government hasn't located, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maggie Lynaugh said.</p><p>Ms. Morgan and Mr. Lichtenstein, who also goes by the nickname Dutch, have promoted themselves as veteran tech and crypto entrepreneurs, according to their social-media posts. Their enterprises include co-founding Demandpath, a venture-capital fund, and Endpass, a cryptocurrency wallet.</p><p>On Medium, a publishing platform, Mr. Lichtenstein's profile describes him as a \"tech entrepreneur, explorer, and occasional magician.\"</p><p>Ms. Morgan's profile on Forbes.com, where her articles are posted, says she is an international economist and serial entrepreneur specializing in software development.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
