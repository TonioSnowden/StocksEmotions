  "title": "Business News:  Workers Abandon Careers in Hospitality  ---  As Covid-19 brings  millions of job losses  in the industry, many  find other service roles  ----  By Kathryn Dill",
  "text": "<p>   The head waiter has become a grocery manager. The conference coordinator works at a software company. And the hotel-sales boss is now in marketing. </p><p>   Workers at America's hotels, restaurants, bars and convention centers have been among the hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and the lack of travel have caused many gathering places to close or reduce their staff. Since February 2020, the leisure-and-hospitality sector has shed nearly four million people, or roughly a quarter of its workforce. As of January 2021, 15.9% of the industry's workers remained unemployed; more than any other industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p><p>   As a result, millions of hospitality workers -- a group that includes everyone from front-desk clerks to travel managers -- are trying to launch new careers. Some have transitioned to roles that tap skills honed over years of public-facing work in high-pressure environments. Others have seized the moment to remake themselves for different occupations. Many remain conflicted about leaving an industry they say continually provides new experiences and engenders lasting relationships. </p><p>   A year ago, Ellen White was head trainer at Public Kitchen on New York City's Lower East Side. There, she schooled the restaurant's workers on the finer points of high-end service. </p><p>   Ms. White supported herself working in restaurants for nearly two decades while acting, until she was furloughed from her restaurant job when the pandemic took hold last spring. Now, she applies that attention to detail to her job as a customer-service representative for a company that processes at-home Covid-19 tests. </p><p>   \"It's easy for me to quell someone's nerves or to calm someone down,\" says Ms. White, 36 years old. \"I'm so used to being face to face with an angry person about cold salmon.\" </p><p>   Others have used the opportunity to develop a new skill set. Jaclyn Garcia, 32, struggled to find work after losing her job as a national sales manager at Loews Hotels &amp; Co. \"It was seven months of just feeling like you're not good enough, after being at the top of your company and your career,\" Ms. Garcia says. </p><p>   She eventually turned to Aspireship, a tuition-free online software-as-a-service, or SaaS, sales-training program. In November, after completing Aspireship's training course, she landed a job as an account manager at ProEst, a construction-estimate software company. </p><p>    Corey Kossack, Aspireship founder and chief executive, launched the program after years of watching workers struggle to pivot into SaaS sales because they didn't have industry skills or certifications. The company partners with employers, earning a fee when companies hire Aspireship grads. </p><p>   \"When the pandemic hit, it created these specific pockets of people who were more motivated than ever to make these moves,\" said Mr. Kossack, a veteran of the software industry. \"The single greatest one has been people coming from hospitality.\" </p><p>   Rachael Ballas, 32, had worked her way up from banquet manager of a small resort in Kentucky to group sales manager at Kimpton Hotels in Chicago, but says she already had been considering a move to another industry when she was laid off in March. </p><p>   \"I wasn't feeling very challenged anymore,\" says Ms. Ballas, who joined ActivePipe, an email marketing platform for real-estate professionals, as an account manager in December. As part of the team, Ms. Ballas says she finds herself pursuing clients; previously she fielded more inbound interest. \"It's given me more of a sense of fulfillment and meaning again.\" </p><p>   Major employers have factored the industry exodus into their own hiring. Last spring, before announcing a plan to hire an additional 150,000 workers across the U.S., Walmart Inc. representatives reached out to the National Restaurant Association and the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Foundation to alert both organizations to the company's desire to hire furloughed hospitality workers. </p><p>    Ginger Fields, head of talent at Farmers Insurance, said she noticed several years ago that the company was getting more applicants from the hospitality industry and that many became successful in direct sales and customer service. Of 100 workers hired between late 2020 and early 2021 for customer-service roles, the company said more than a third have hospitality- or service-industry backgrounds. </p><p>   \"Challenging situations, thinking on their feet, problem-solving, being resilient, moving on to the next customer interaction with a smiling face -- we find it translates really well,\" Ms. Fields said. </p><p></p>",
