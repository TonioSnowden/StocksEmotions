  "title": "U.S. News:  In Uvalde, Guns Get  New Political Focus  ----  By Elizabeth Findell",
  "text": "<p>   UVALDE, Texas -- On a recent hot evening, in a town that two months ago saw a gunman kill 19 children and two teachers in a classroom, a few dozen people filtered into an auditorium to look for political solutions to prevent gun deaths. </p><p>   They live in a congressional district that in just five years has been the site of or has neighbored three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. The 500-mile-wide district extends from El Paso, 6 miles from a 2019 Walmart massacre, to the eastern edge of San Antonio, 18 miles from a 2017 Sutherland Springs church slaughter. It includes Uvalde and reaches almost to Odessa, the site of a 2019 drive-by shooting spree. </p><p>   \"We need to send a message to every local and state official that supports the sale of AR-15s to children that your days are numbered because we are coming after you in the voting booth,\" said Aide Escamilla, a local professor who has called for raising the age for such gun purchases from 18 to 21 or older. Dr. Escamilla said she voted for GOP Gov. Greg Abbott in 2018 but doesn't plan to vote for him again because of his response to the shooting. </p><p>   Across South and West Texas -- where people from all over the state flock to hunting ranches to shoot game, ranchers want protection in remote areas and target shooting is popular -- guns are a way of life. But after mass violence in Uvalde and other nearby areas, many residents are showing a new interest in making changes to gun policies. </p><p>   In Uvalde, a city of 16,000 in a county that voted 60% for then-President Donald Trump in 2020, hundreds of locals marched in the streets in 100-degree heat to call for greater gun-control measures. Residents successfully appealed to city leaders in nearby Hondo to cancel a rental of city property for a Friends of the NRA fundraiser. They are brainstorming ways to fight assault-rifle sales within the county. </p><p>   The renewed gun-control advocacy is pushing local political leaders -- Democrats and Republicans -- to embrace moderate changes to gun laws. The district's congressman, Tony Gonzales, was recently among just 10 House Republicans to support the first major gun legislation since 1994. </p><p>   Texas Sen. John Cornyn has drawn backlash from fellow Republicans for co-sponsoring the Safer Communities Act, which tightens some gun-buying provisions and provides mental-health funding. For Mr. Gonzales, a supporter of gun rights, his vote for the legislation represented the mood of his district. </p><p>   \"One thing after the Uvalde shooting that I heard across my constituency, [including] the most conservative folks. . .was 'Hey Tony, we need to do something,'\" said Mr. Gonzales. </p><p>   Some 180 people in Uvalde County have registered to vote since the May shooting at Robb Elementary School, according to registration records. </p><p>   Miguel Cerrillo, whose 11-year-old daughter, Miah, testified to a U.S. House committee that she survived the siege by covering herself in a classmate's blood to play dead, registered to vote for the first time. He was motivated by fury at political officials at all levels and a belief that racism was at play in the handling of the shooting, he said. He would also like to see the age to buy assault rifles raised to 21. </p><p>   \"We want all new people; they're not doing anything good,\" said Mr. Cerrillo, noting specifically that he wanted members of the school board and city council replaced, as well as Mr. Abbott. He didn't specify his party affiliation. </p><p>   Federal records show background checks for gun purchases in Texas increased in the month after the shooting. Brian Kanke, a Hondo Republican and National Rifle Association member who owns a business supplying deer and other animals to hunting ranches, said 18-year-olds should be allowed to buy guns because they can be drafted into war, and said he believes anyone on a mission to kill will find a way to get weapons. </p><p>   While many supporters of guns have been quieter in the aftermath of the shooting, Mr. Kanke said their views will show through in November, and if the legislature makes any move toward new gun measures, \"We'll gladly let our legislature know our opinion,\" he said. </p><p>   The Uvalde City Council, county commissioners and school board all recently approved resolutions urging Mr. Abbott to call a special legislative session to raise the age to buy assault weapons. </p><p>   Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughin, a Republican, called to raise the purchase age of such weapons, telling county Commissioner Ronald Garza, a Democrat who introduced the resolution, \"Definite hell yes, I agree with you,\" in remarks during a city council meeting. </p><p>   Mr. Abbott hasn't announced a special session of the legislature. A spokeswoman for the governor, Renae Eze, cited actions he has taken including allocating money for mental-health and resiliency resources and requesting several school-safety and training reviews. </p><p></p>",
