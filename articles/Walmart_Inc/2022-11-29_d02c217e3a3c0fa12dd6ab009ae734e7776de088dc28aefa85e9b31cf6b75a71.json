The estimates were part of a consumer survey the retail trade group conducted with Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics. The group's forecast called for about 166 million people to shop over the five-day period.</p><p>The figures are in line with other data over the weekend that showed more shoppers headed back to the social activity of shopping. Some early data shows they didn't buy more items than last year during those visits, but spending by dollar amount rose steadily amid higher prices.</p><p>Photos: Black Friday Is Back </p><p>PHOTO: Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Retail sales between Thanksgiving and this past Sunday rose 10.9% from a year earlier, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures all forms of payment. The data, which includes spending at restaurants, but not automobiles, aren't adjusted for inflation.</p><p>Heading into the holiday season, consumers showed signs of restrained spending on some items as the price of food, gas and other productsremained elevated. Executives from retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. said in recent weeks shoppers had pulled back on discretionary spending and were eating into their savings to make purchases.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do holiday retail numbers suggest about the state of the economy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Spending is still happening, said NRF President Matthew Shay on a call with reporters Tuesday, as many people give priority to holiday celebrations and unemployment is still low. People have done roughly half of their holiday shopping so far based on surveys, Mr. Shay said. \"There certainly is a recognition and concern about prices and inflation and yet people are still out spending,\" he said.</p><p>Shoppers spent an average of $325.44 on holiday purchases over the weekend, up about 8% from 2021, the NRF said. U.S. consumer prices in October were up about 7.7% from the same month a year ago, a slowdown from June when inflation hit the highest level in four decades, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>Online spending grew at a slower pace over Black Friday weekend compared with last year as some shoppers favored bricks-and-mortar stores. Online sales on Black Friday rose 2.3% to $9.12 billion, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks spending on websites. On Thanksgiving people spent $5.3 billion online, up 2.9% from the holiday last year, according to Adobe.</p><p>By Monday, as more shoppers headed back to work, spending online grew more quickly. Sales by dollar value grew 5.8% to $11.3 billion on Monday, compared with the same day last year, according to Adobe Analytics. The numbers aren't adjusted for inflation.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Millions of Shoppers Returned to Stores Over Black Friday Weekend</p>",
