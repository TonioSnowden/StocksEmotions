  "text": "<p>Between 2013 and 2018 over $197 million in payments sent or received at Walmart were the subject of fraud complaints, it said. The agency said Walmart was aware that fraudsters were using its systems and didn't do enough to stop it.</p><p>\"The company did not properly train its employees, failed to warn customers, and used procedures that allowed fraudsters to cash out at its stores,\" said the FTC.</p><p>Walmart called the suit \"factually misguided and legally flawed,\" and said it would fight it. Walmart also said the FTC denied it the due process of hearing from the company directly.</p><p>Walmart stores allow shoppers to transfer money using services such as Western Union and Ria for a fee. Customers can send or pick up cash or make bank deposits in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico, as well as through a network of partner locations in other international locations.</p><p>The five-member commission voted 3-2 in favor of filing the civil penalty complaint.</p><p>The FTC is asking the court to require Walmart to return money to customers and pay financial penalties.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
