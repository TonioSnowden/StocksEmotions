  "text": "<p>Stocks have rallied in recent days as data indicated pricing pressures moderated last month for both consumers and suppliers. Investors are betting that a slowdown in inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to ease up on interest-rate increases.</p><p>\"Clearly there are these hopes for a true peak in inflation and hawkishness from central banks,\" said Thomas McGarrity, head of equities at RBC Wealth Management. But he cautioned that stocks are likely to remain volatile as investors face the rising risks of a global recession in 2023.</p><p>\"We're not completely out of the woods yet,\" he said.</p><p>Investors are also watching for clues on how consumers are coping with inflation and high borrowing costs. Data Wednesday showed U.S. retail sales rose 1.3% in October from the prior month. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1.2% increase.</p><p>Quarterly updates from U.S. retailers have offered a more mixed picture.</p><p>Target on Wednesdaysaid its shoppers pulled back in the latest quarter amid a worsening economic outlook. That contrasted with more upbeat results from retailers including Lowe's and Walmart, which on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected salesfor the fall quarter.</p><p>The results \"pointed to some resilience for the U.S. consumer,\" said Louise Dudley, an equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. \"A lot of investors will be looking towards how that holiday spending comes through, and whether the consumer does go out and spend or not.\"</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 3.732%, from 3.798% Tuesday. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to near-term interest rate expectations, rose to 4.361%, from 4.359%. Yields fall as prices rise.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar continued to come under pressure after a blistering rally this year. The WSJ Dollar Index edged down 0.2% Wednesday but remains up more than 10% this year.</p><p>Cryptocurrency prices were slightly lower as the fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX spreads. Bitcoin slipped 2.3% from its 5 p.m. ET price to $16,489. Ether fell about 2%.</p><p>In commodity markets, prices for Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 1.8% to $92.18.</p><p>European stocks were lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.7% while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 slipped 0.1%. The domestic-focused FTSE 250 index fell 1.8% after data showed U.K. inflation rose to a fresh 41-year highin October on surging energy prices.</p><p>In Asia, indexes were mixed.
