We still buy Chinese goods at Amazon and Walmart, send our team to the Olympics, watch China-wood movies and wokify our military.</p><p>Brian Brandt</p><p>Lansdale, Pa.</p><p>---</p><p>Thirty years ago, Golden State Warriors guard Sarunas Marciulionis resurrected the Lithuanian national basketball team following a half-century of Soviet oppression. He did so with the financial and in-kind support of Warriors leadership (Donnie Nelson), the corner bank (Bank of America) and a popular local rock band (the Grateful Dead). In the 1992 Olympics, Mr. Marciulionis led Lithuania to a bronze-medal victory over the Russians. The players were celebrated as heroes.</p><p>I encourage Mr. Palihapitiya to brush up on the history of the team he owns.</p><p>Thomas C. Shumaker Jr.</p><p>Jackson, Wyo.</p>",
