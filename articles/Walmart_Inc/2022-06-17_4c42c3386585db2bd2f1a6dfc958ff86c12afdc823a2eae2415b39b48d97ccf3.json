  "title": "Walmart Is Pulling MyPillow Products From Shelves; MyPillow's chief executive faces litigation over his unproven claims of fraud in the 2020 election",
  "text": "<p>A Walmart spokeswoman said MyPillow products remain available online. She declined to elaborate on the decision.</p><p>Mr. Lindell, in an interview, said Walmart executives told him MyPillow products were pulled from store shelves because they didn't meet the retailer's internal rating criteria.</p><p>He also said he believed Walmart stopped selling the items in stores because of his advocacy against electronic voting machines.</p><p>MyPillow sales have increased recently, Mr. Lindell said. He said he offered a lower price on his products, which Walmart refused.</p><p>Dominion Voting Systems sued Mr. Lindell and MyPillow for more than $1.3 billion in damages last year. The suit asserts Mr. Lindell made false accusations that Dominion had rigged the 2020 election for President Biden. Mr. Lindell countersued; a judge in May dismissed the countersuit.</p><p>No court or election authority has found widespread fraud in the 2020 election.</p><p>Mr. Lindell said he expects his company will lose around $20 million a year, adding that Walmart is the largest seller of his company's flagship product.</p><p>In addition to pillows, MyPillow sells towels, sheets and mattresses. Other retailers have also stopped selling MyPillow products since Mr. Lindell began promoting the election-fraud claims. Twitter Inc. permanently suspended Mr. Lindell last year for repeatedly violating its civic-integrity policy, Twitter has said.</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com.</p><p>Walmart Is Pulling MyPillow Products From Shelves</p>",
