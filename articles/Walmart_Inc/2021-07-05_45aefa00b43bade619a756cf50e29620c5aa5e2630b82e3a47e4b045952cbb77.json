  "text": "<p>You wait 122 years for a bidder then three arrive at once.&#xa0;</p> <p>What can be learned from the very public auction for Wm Morrison between some of the world's biggest buyout funds? The agreed £6.3bn offer from a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd0219a-6acb-4e17-be9f-69c54c85e330\">Fortress-led consortium</a> over the weekend is unlikely to be the end of the story. Apollo Global Management has already said it is weighing up a counterbid. Spurned suitor Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice is still working on its response.&#xa0;</p> <p>The easiest question to answer is: why now? After a rash of bids for London-listed companies this year the answer is well rehearsed. Brexit-related sterling volatility and resistance among fund managers to buy UK domestic stocks over the past half decade has left them looking cheap versus international peers. </p> <p>Britain is in the bargain basement during a worldwide race to close deals before inflation raises the prospect of higher borrowing rates, and before legislative threats such as reform of US capital gains tax rein in potential returns.&#xa0;</p> <p>Morrisons presents a relatively straightforward target. It promises utility-like cash generation paired with freehold property, logistics and manufacturing assets that under private ownership should be easier to gear. As the business is healthy, preserving the culture is the main complication. All sides want to appear respectful to the legacy of Ken Morrison, whose dislike of debt helped maintain independence for a chain that opened for business in 1899 and went public in 1967.</p> <p>The Fortress consortium has won backing from management by promising to change very little. Its commitments set a bar for other bidders to match or go hostile. </p> <p>Yet it is worth remembering that Morrisons has been touted around potential buyers before. Members of the founding family sounded out private equity funds in 2014 after a profit warning exhausted their patience with chief executive Dalton Philips. There were no takers. Trading uncertainties and financing costs proved too great.&#xa0;</p> <p>Back then, everyone knew what was ailing Morrisons. The grocer lacked the scale needed to compete on price against Asda, Tesco and the discounters. Investments in convenience and online delivery looked too late to make a difference. Advertising campaigns were deemed to miss the mark in the chain's northern heartlands and in the south of England, which was still commonly viewed as hostile territory despite the acquisition of Safeway a decade previously.</p> <p>What has changed since? Surprisingly little. Annual turnover has barely moved between then and now. Market share has been stuck for more than a decade at approximately 11 per cent. And while profitability has improved under David Potts, chief executive since 2015, the valuation has not.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Morrisons' financial conservatism, vertically integrated supply chain and social responsibility often attract praise. But before it became a takeover target investors had shown few signs of caring. On the day in 2014 when news first broke that the founding family was open to a sale, the stock peaked at 250p; the Fortress consortium over the weekend offers just a 4p premium to that level.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now the market is buying Morrisons in anticipation of a bidding war. It is a bet that the company is about 50 per cent more valuable in private ownership than they had been prepared to pay a month ago. Yet there is nothing in Fortress's plan that could not have been achieved under the current ownership structure. </p> <p>UK supermarkets are cheap thanks to decades of incoherent expansion strategies and self-destructive price wars. The sector's significant change in recent times came with the junk bond-funded takeover of Asda by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79964b33-2406-41c8-8f24-4ff5552f1669\">TDR Capital and the Issa brothers</a>, which threatens to neuter a historically troublesome competitor with a deep-pocketed US owner. Buyout funds stepped in after equity investors failed to react to this easing of competitive pressure on the sector. </p> <p>The accepted offer on the table relies not on financial engineering or asset stripping but on the likelihood that supermarket prices will now start to rise and life will get more difficult for the average British shopper. Any higher proposal will use that assumption as a starting point. It all makes for a desultory measure of the efficiency of public markets.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'A Wm Morrison bidding war is a failure of public markets' FT.com 5 July.
