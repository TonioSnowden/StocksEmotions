  "title": "Stocks Mixed With Retail Earnings in Focus; Walmart shares rose after the retailer raised its outlook for fiscal year",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have largely rallied in recent days, with the S&amp;P 500 climbing for four straight weeks as of last Friday. Weak data on China's economy and U.S. manufacturing are weighing on sentiment, spurring concerns that the momentum may be fading, investors said.</p><p>The retailers' earnings reports are being scrutinized for signals about how rising prices are affecting consumer spending. Walmart and Home Depot reported on Tuesday and Target and others are scheduled for later in the week.</p><p>\"It's going to be about inventory levels, margins and pricing power and if consumers are still spending on discretionary, or if all their wages are going to food and energy,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>Shares of Walmart climbed 5.6% after the big-box retailer reported earnings that beat estimates and raised its outlook for the fiscal year, less than a month after it had issued a profit warning. Its CEO said the company had been able to cut costs in its supply chains.</p><p>Home Depot rose 3.9% after the retailer posted record quarterly sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates but also said customer transactions had declined.</p><p>Oil prices edged lower, with global crude benchmark Brent down 1.8% to trade at $93.47 a barrel.</p><p>The bond market continued to flash a recessionary signal, with the yield curve inverted. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 2.843%, down from 2.790% Monday, while the two-year yield reached 3.220%.</p><p>A data release Tuesday showed that housing starts in the U.S. declined in July from the previous month and were lower than economists had forecast.</p><p>Josh Jamner, an investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge, said he believed the fresh housing data was behind Tuesday's added market volatility and continued recessionary fears.</p><p>\"The cake is not baked. There's certainly a path and a chance for the Fed to navigate us towards a soft landing,\" Mr. Jamner said. \"This incremental data points says OK, let's slightly back away from that soft landing outcome.\"</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.1%. In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed with the Shanghai Composite Index closing little changed and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declining about 1%.</p><p>Stocks Mixed With Retail Earnings in Focus</p>",
