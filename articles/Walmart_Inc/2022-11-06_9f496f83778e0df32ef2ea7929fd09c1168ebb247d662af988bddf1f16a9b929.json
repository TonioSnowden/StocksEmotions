  "title": "'Kaufmann's' Review: Imperial Emporium; Jacob Kaufmann sold sundries to steelworkers, saved his money and bought a little shop. The result, over time, was Pittsburgh's retail giant.",
  "text": "<p>These retailing giants underwrote civic life in other ways. Their owners were often leading figures in philanthropy and local improvement projects. The stores opened career opportunities to women, who also availed themselves of the retailers' fashionable dining rooms. And their window displays, parades and other attention-seeking activities enlivened city life. As the former promotions director at one store explained: \"We made retailing theater.\"</p><p>That store was Kaufmann's, for decades a Pittsburgh landmark. Journalists Marylynne Pitz and Laura Malt Schneiderman chronicle the proud voyage and eventual capsizing of this emblematic downtown dreadnought in \"Kaufmann's: The Family That Built Pittsburgh's Famed Department Store.\" The result is a revealing case study of the type of retail institution that once played such a prominent role in American life—as well as a portrait of the glittering Kaufmann family.</p><p>Like so many of the great American retailing families, the Kaufmanns were Jews—in particular, German Jews. Jacob Kaufmann, who started it all, came to America in 1868 as a young man, driven by anti-Semitism, economic woes and his own adventurous spirit. Trudging 10 to 20 miles daily in all weather, he joined other immigrants \"peddling small sewing items such as buttons, needles, and thread to the coal miners and mill workers of western Pennsylvania.\"</p><p>Jacob learned his customers' cultures and languages, gave credit, saved his money, invested in a horse-drawn cart, sent for his brother Isaac, and with him bet everything on a little shop. They catered to steelworkers and their families, following their father's principles: \"Good merchants make small profits and many sales. . . . Deal fairly and be patient and in time dishonest competitors will crowd your store with customers.\"</p><p>Two more brothers came, all worked furiously and the family enterprise grew with Pittsburgh, eventually into an enormous store. By the turn of the 20th century, the Kaufmanns were hugely successful. Excluded from the Duquesne Club, the luxurious redoubt of Carnegie and Frick and Mellon, the Kaufmanns helped launch the Concordia Club as a Jewish alternative. The brothers, ever wealthier, built or acquired mansions and held debutante parties but also established a pattern of philanthropy. As the first-generation Kaufmanns died off, their descendants fought over money and power. Some family members even started a competing store. But the multi-faceted 20th-century emporium that Kaufmann's came to be was built up by Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr. (1885-1955), one of Jacob's nephews, who consolidated his grip on the business through legal and financial maneuverings and an instrumental marriage to his cousin Lillian.</p><p>The consummate merchant prince, E.J., as he was known, wasn't content with mere profit, though he no doubt believed most of his costly initiatives contributed to the bottom line. But he genuinely felt a larger obligation, and he acted on it—for example, by organizing and funding relief efforts for desperate Pittsburghers during the Depression. At the same time he invested a fortune to remodel Kaufmann's into an Art Deco retail palace.</p><p>His vision, and that of so many downtown retailers who strained to create temples of elegance and plenty, was to achieve success by elevating and enlarging the lives of everyday shoppers rather than by catering to their coarser instincts. Thus, after commissioning a series of immense murals by Boardman Robinson (\"The History of Trade\") for Kaufmann's, E.J. unveiled them at a 1930 gala, where he told 600 guests: \"The highest achievement of commerce is the patronage of beauty.\"</p><p>E.J. was a patron of beauty in his private life as well, even aside from his role as Pittsburgh's leading playboy. His most enduring aesthetic contribution was to commission two extraordinary houses: first, Frank Lloyd Wright's iconic Fallingwater, in the countryside of western Pennsylvania; and then, in Palm Springs, Calif., a modernist gem by Richard Neutra today known as the Kaufmann House.</p><p>A paternalistic employer, E.J. saw to it that Kaufmann's workers had everything from continuing education for career advancement to subsidized summer vacations (though, like most stores, Kaufmann's was slow to hire blacks beyond menial positions). Benefits were generous, and proper speech and comportment were emphasized. \"Employee-written articles,\" the authors note, \"urged sales clerks to say 'Madam' instead of 'Lady' when addressing shoppers, and 'This is fashionable' rather than 'This is nifty.' \"</p><p>After World War II, like many family-operated department stores, Kaufmann's was sold to a larger outfit, in this case the May Co. The years that followed, though prosperous at first, were marked by trends that would prove fatal, including the rise of the automobile, the flight of affluent shoppers from downtown, and the advent of such discount powerhouses as Walmart, Target and Costco.</p><p>\"Kaufmann's\" is concise and deeply researched if a bit pedestrian. For a deeper sense of the man behind the store, try Franklin Toker's \"Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E.J. Kaufmann, and America's Most Extraordinary House\" (2003). Still, for understanding the rise and fall of department stores, by all means visit \"Kaufmann's.\"</p><p>Mr. Akst writes the Journal's weekly news quiz.</p><p>'Kaufmann's' Review: Imperial Emporium</p>",
