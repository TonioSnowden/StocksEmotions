  "title": "Business News: Walgreens Profit Gets Boost From Covid-19 Vaccines",
  "text": "<p>Covid so far has hurt Walgreens more than it has helped, the company said.</p><p>Store sales are down amid pandemic-related lockdowns, prescription volumes dropped as people put off medical care, and sales of cold-and-flu products tanked as Covid precautions prevented many people from getting sick from other bugs. Meantime, the company is spending more to keep workers and customers safe and stores stocked.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced in March that it would increase the payment rate for vaccines to $40 for each dose, up from $28 for a single dose and $45 for two doses.</p><p>It isn't clear if all insurers will match the government's $40 rate, Walgreens finance chief James Kehoe said, though the company's increased profit forecast is based on that reimbursement rate.</p><p>The company reported a stronger profit for its latest quarter, a performance that comes as it looks to make itself a cornerstone in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines under new Chief Executive Rosalind Brewer.</p><p>Rivals including CVS Health Corp., as well as supermarket chain Kroger Co. and Walmart Inc., are also pushing to get consumers to visit their locations to receive vaccines.</p><p>\"Our team will move swiftly and decisively to best serve the needs of our patients, customers and communities around the world, at this critical time and beyond,\" said Ms. Brewer, who took the helm at Walgreens earlier in March.</p><p>Walgreens on Wednesday reported $32.8 billion in sales from continuing operations for its quarter that ended Feb. 28, up almost 5% from the year-earlier period.</p><p>Comparable sales in the U.S. were up 2%, including a 4.5% gain in pharmacy items. Demand for other retail products was lower, amid a weaker cough, cold and flu season, the company said.</p><p>Profit rose to $1.03 billion, or $1.19 a share, from $946 million, or $1.07 a share, for the year-earlier period. After adjustments, Walgreens reported earnings of $1.40 a share, ahead of what analysts expected for that metric.</p>",
