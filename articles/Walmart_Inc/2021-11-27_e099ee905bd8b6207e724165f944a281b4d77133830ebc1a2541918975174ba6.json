  "text": "<p>\n  TARGET CORP. </p><p>\n  TGT -2.5% </p><p>\n  Many retail employees had something to be thankful for this year: no work on Turkey Day. Target, Walmart Inc. and other merchants kept their physical locations closed on Thanksgiving for another year, after holiday closures during the pandemic proved popular with customers -- and employees. Target said Monday it would make the store closures permanent; its chief executive called it \"our new standard\" in a letter to employees. Other retailers like Walmart said they were using closures this year to show their appreciation to employees and boost retention. Target shares lost 2.5% Monday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  DEERE &amp; CO. </p><p>\n  DE +5.3% </p><p>\n  Nothing runs like a Deere, even during a strike. The manufacturer saw minimal fallout from its recent workers' walkout, reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits and forecasting continued strong sales at higher prices next year. Employees represented by the United Auto Workers union returned to their jobs last week after a five-week strike, ratifying a new contract that provides them higher wages, bonuses and other benefits over six years. Deere said the deal will cost the company as much as $300 million a year during the contract. Deere shares rose 5.3% Wednesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC. </p><p>\n  AAL -8.8% </p><p>\n  A new Covid variant is causing fresh turbulence for airlines. Governments across Europe and Asia placed new restrictions on flights and travelers from a swath of southern Africa to stem the transmission of a variant identified in the region. Airline shares fell sharply Friday amid worry that broader travel bans could be imposed just as many parts of the world were starting to fly again. American Airlines shares fell 8.8% Friday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  BEST BUY CO. </p><p>\n  BBY -12% </p><p>\n  People are shopping at stores again. Best Buy reported Tuesday that its U.S. e-commerce sales fell 10.1% from a year earlier, a period when many shoppers bought goods online while stores were closed due to Covid-19. Consumers are still spending freely on sporting goods and kitchen appliances, as overall consumer demand remains strong in spite of rising prices and global supply-chain snarls. Best Buy expects a strong holiday season but a slowdown in sales growth versus earlier in the year, said Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas. Best Buy shares plummeted 12% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  J.M. SMUCKER CO. </p><p>\n  SJM +5.7% </p><p>\n  Higher prices didn't jam sales for Smucker's spreads. The company behind Jif peanut butter and its namesake jellies said sales in the second quarter rose as higher prices and demand helped it offset higher costs and supply-chain challenges. J.M. Smucker said in August it would raise prices to combat cost inflation. Weather in places like Brazil, Texas and the Pacific Northwest also drove up costs for commodities. The company said it planned to pass the higher costs through to consumers, raising prices on coffee and other products. Smucker shares rose 5.7% Tuesday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS INC. </p><p>\n  ZM -15% </p><p>\n  Zoom is suffering from Zoom fatigue. The videoconferencing company reported a slowdown in quarterly sales growth as more people return to work. Zoom has been unable to maintain the strong growth of the pandemic's earlier days driven by a large shift to remote work. The company also faces increased competition, as Microsoft Corp.'s Teams application poses one of the biggest challenges to Zoom's market share. Zoom shares lost 15% Tuesday, but recovered some of that drop Friday as new concerns about a Covid-19 variant pushed its stock back up. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GAP INC. </p><p>\n  GPS -24% </p><p>\n  Gaps in the global supply chain are creating new problems for Gap. On Tuesday it said factory closures and port delays caused it to miss out on sales while spending extra on air cargo, joining a growing list of clothing companies facing similar challenges. Victoria's Secret &amp; Co., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. and other chains, which rely on Asia for much of their production, have also warned of transportation problems and production delays that left them unable to capitalize on strong consumer demand. Gap shares plunged 24% Wednesday. </p><p></p>",
