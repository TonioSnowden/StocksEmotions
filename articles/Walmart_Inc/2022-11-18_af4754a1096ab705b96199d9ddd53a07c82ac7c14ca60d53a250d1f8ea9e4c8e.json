  "title": "Foot Locker Lifts Outlook After Better-Than-Expected Third Quarter; Shares soar after retailer boosts profit, sales views even as markdowns cut into margins",
  "text": "<p>The New York City-based sneaker and athletic-wear retailer said same-store sales, which strip out effects of store openings and closings, were up eight-tenths of a percentage point from record levels seen last year.</p><p>Overall sales slipped slightly to $2.17 billion due to the stronger dollar. Excluding the impact of currencies, Foot Locker said sales would have been up 3.3%. Analysts polled by FactSet expected sales of $2.09 billion.</p><p>For the quarter ended Oct. 29, Foot Locker posted a profit of $96 million, or $1.01 a share, down from $158 million, or $1.52 a share, in the same quarter a year ago.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings were $1.27 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $1.11 a share.</p><p>Gross margin slipped, as the chain stepped up promotional activity and faced what it called modest supply-chain cost pressure.</p><p>Heartened by its third-quarter performance, Foot Locker lifted its outlook for the year. It now expects annual sales to decline 4% to 5%, compared with its prior forecast for a 6% to 7% drop. Adjusted earnings are projected to reach $4.42 to $4.50 a share, an 11-cent jump from the midpoint of its previous guidance.</p><p>Foot Locker's results come amid a mixed week of earnings from retailers ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. Macy's Inc. and Kohl's Corp. reported a drop in sales for their latest quarters as shoppers delayed their holiday purchases. Target Corp. said sales slowed, and it cut its outlook for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Walmart Inc. attracted more shoppers in its latest quarter, as its reputation for low prices attracted consumers battered by inflation.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Foot Locker Lifts Outlook After Better-Than-Expected Third Quarter</p>",
