  "title": "Why did the Dow plunge? 'Stagflationary shockwaves' destroy a bear-market bounce; Dow plunges almost 1,200 points Wednesday, stocks erase Tuesday's rally",
  "text": "<p>\"It's never wise to make too much of a bounce which has not achieved significant technical progress, particularly when no real capitulation has occurred, despite ongoing bearishness,\" said Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, in a Tuesday note.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 1,164 points, or 3.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX shed 4% to end at 3,923 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 4.7%. That comes after the Dow jumped more than 400 points on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 2% and the Nasdaq rallied 2.8%.</p><p>Equities last week tumbled sharply, with the S&amp;P 500 coming within a whisker of entering bear market territory —- a drop of 20% from a recent peak —- before bouncing on Friday. A close below 3,837. 25 would mark a 20% drop from the large-cap benchmark's Jan. 3 record finish.</p><p>See: Despite bounce, S&amp;P 500 hovers close to bear market. Here's the number that counts</p><p>While the S&amp;P 500 has yet to technically enter bear territory, analysts have noted the selloff has demonstrated bear-market characteristics. Some technical analysts have been wary of calling a near-term bottom as the selloff in equities, while steep, had remained largely orderly.</p><p>A failure by the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, sometimes referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, to push above the mid-30 range was seen as one sign that investors hadn't made the sort of \"capitulation\" that often clears the way for a sustained rebound. However, some positive market internals on the upside during Friday's and Tuesday's bounce have some analysts looking for some near-term upside, which could continue to confound market bears.</p><p>Wednesday's weakness came as investors, who had brushed off severely disappointing results from Walmart Inc. WMT a day earlier, were rattled as rival Target Corp. TGT also revealed that it saw its margins take a hit from rising labor and fuel costs. Target shares dropped 24.9%, leading losses across the retail sector.</p><p>Read: Target stock plunges as profit drops on consumer spending shifts and jump in freight costs</p><p>\"The relief rally trap door sprung when the S&amp; P 500 4,000 pins snapped after Target's earnings results exacerbated some recession fears that continued the theme of rising inventories detailed by Walmart on Tuesday. And the broad-based sell-off absolutely hammered tech,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, in emailed comments.</p><p>\"Indeed, contagion from bellwether consumer earnings prints is sending stagflationary shockwaves through the market, and equities suffered another massive bout of indigestion after [Tuesday's] Alka Seltzer moment,\" he said.</p><p>What was particularly troubling was that Target was supposed to be shielded from a sharp rise by the U.S. dollar versus major rivals because it's a domestic-only retailer, noted Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier &amp; Associates, in a note.</p><p>Remarks on Tuesday by Jerome Powell, read as a hawkish affirmation of the central bank's resolve to tighten policy until inflation convincingly falls even if it causes economic pain, were also cited as a factor, he noted.</p><p>\"More than ever, evidence of peak inflation may be needed for a sustained market recovery,\" Navellier wrote.</p><p>See also: Stock investors are now starting to feel the 5 stages of bear-market grief</p><p>Why did the Dow plunge?
