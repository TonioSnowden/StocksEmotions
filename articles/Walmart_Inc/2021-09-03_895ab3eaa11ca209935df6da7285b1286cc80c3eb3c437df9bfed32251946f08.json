  "text": "<p>Sales at Asda fell from last year's pandemic-driven peak in the group's first full quarter under new ownership, as two more top executives quit the supermarket chain.</p> <p>Chief operating officer Anthony Hemmerdinger and chief strategy officer Preyash Thakrar have both left the UK's third-largest food retailer with immediate effect.</p> <p>Hemmerdinger was seen as the most obvious internal candidate to succeed Roger Burnley, the previous chief executive who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/163d92fa-d227-4877-8554-406ee0fa0335\">cleared his desk</a> last month despite initially indicating he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a604bfa-df76-4466-8e5c-ed652c23b068\">remain in post</a> for a year.</p> <p>The duo are the latest in a series of senior executives to leave the business since it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f814b7c7-4b35-47a3-9b87-8af2153001be\">acquired in February</a> by Mohsin and Zuber Issa, two brothers who made their fortune building up fuel retailer EG Group, alongside private equity group TDR Capital.</p> <p>Steph Strike, the longstanding head of the George clothing label, and interim finance director Rob McWilliam have also quit in recent months, though there have also been high-profile new hires in other areas and McWilliam was replaced on a permanent basis by his former deputy John Fallon.</p> <p>Asda is still searching for a new chief executive, with some reports indicating that Ian McLeod, a former Asda executive currently running Asian food retailer Dairy Farm, could return to the UK to take up the role.</p> <p>However, one person with knowledge of the company said that in the meantime, Mohsin Issa in particular had been taking a more active role in the day-to-day running of the company since the UK's competition regulator cleared the acquisition in June.</p> <p>Same-store sales excluding fuel fell 0.7 per cent to £5bn in the quarter to June, a performance that the Issas described in a statement as “incredibly resilient”. In the same quarter last year all supermarkets benefited from the closure of the entire hospitality industry and all retail deemed non-essential.</p> <p>In the quarter, sales were up 3.1 per cent from the same period in 2019, before the pandemic struck, with sales of premium food ranges notably higher. General merchandise sales, a more important part of the mix at Asda than at many rivals, were also up.</p> <p>Adjusted underlying earnings were £315m in the quarter, though no comparative figure was given.&#xa0;</p> <p>Like all supermarket groups, Asda has seen the share of online grocery as a percentage of the total slip as the rollout of vaccines has made customers more confident about shopping in store. This is likely to have boosted margins given that in-store shopping is still generally more profitable than home delivery. </p> <p>The Issas confirmed plans to open just under 30 Asda On the Move convenience stores at EG petrol stations over what remains of this year, with another 200 planned for 2022. Asda will supply the stores under a wholesale agreement.</p> <p>“We continue to see significant opportunities to drive innovation across the business and we look forward to working with the Asda team to execute our growth strategy,” the brothers said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Kaye Wiggins</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'Asda sales slip as more executives quit' FT.com 3 September.
