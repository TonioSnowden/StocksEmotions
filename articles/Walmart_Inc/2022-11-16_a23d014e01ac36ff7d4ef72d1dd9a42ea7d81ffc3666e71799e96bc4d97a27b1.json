  "title": "Target's Flagging Margins Aren't a Red Flag; The miss at the retailer isn't entirely surprising given its heavier reliance on discretionary goods",
  "text": "<p>But the retailer's own ambitious operating margin guidance of 6% in the back half of its fiscal year seems to have created a target on its own back. They deteriorated in the most recent quarter to 3.9%, about half of what they were a year earlier.</p><p>This was for a variety of reasons: Not only are customers snapping up items on sale and shunning full-price purchases, but Target also called out higher theft, which it estimates has shrunk its gross profit by more than $400 million year to date compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Inventory also remained higher than expected and was up 14% compared with a year earlier. This part is less concerning, though, given that much of that excess was due to the early arrival of holiday inventory. Lead times for shipping have gotten unexpectedly shorter recently—about three weeks less last quarter compared with a year earlier, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on the earnings call on Wednesday.</p><p>This was the third consecutive quarter in which Target has missed Wall Street expectations on earnings per share, though—a glaring blemish for a company that is so used to beating them. Target's stock shed more than 11% on Wednesday.</p><p>Things aren't exactly looking up, either. Target said demand only worsened later in the quarter. The retailer now expects a low-single digit percentage decline in comparable sales in the fourth quarter and slashed its operating margin expectation to 3%. The company said it would start a cost-cutting effort aimed at saving $2 billion to $3 billion over the next three years.</p><p>Much of Target's weakness compared with Walmart, which reported strong results a day earlier, is to be expected given its higher dependence on selling discretionary goods. While Walmart is seeing new traffic from higher-income customers trading down, Target isn't exactly known for being the cheapest destination.</p><p>Customers clearly still like shopping there, though. Traffic, or the number of transactions, rose 1.4% last quarter from a year earlier. And demand actually looks surprisingly healthy in certain categories such as beauty products, which saw sales grow by a midteens percentage. Food and beverage sales grew by a low double-digit percentage, only slightly behind Walmart's U.S. division. Meanwhile, Target's apparel sales were down only slightly.</p><p>Given its price and product positioning, Target doesn't have a great record during downturns. In a research note, BMO Capital Markets said that, among big and small-box retailers it covers, Target troughed at the lowest valuation during the recession.</p><p>But Target is clearly focused on the longer game, taking short-term hits to the bottom line to improve customer experience. Notably, the company took painful impairments to clear up space for new merchandise in its second fiscal quarter and it plans to hire 100,000 seasonal employees for the holidays, in line with last year, unlike Walmart, which reduced its seasonal employee count.</p><p>It appears well-positioned to pull customers away from department stores during the holidays given its partnerships with popular brands such as Disney, Ulta Beauty and Apple. Its holiday assortment will include toys from FAO Schwarz and gourmet gifts from British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer.</p><p>Target's laser focus on customer experience is probably going to weigh on its bottom line for a while, but hitting short-term targets isn't the way to win the long game.</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>Target's Flagging Margins Aren't a Red Flag</p>",
