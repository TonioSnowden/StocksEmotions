  "title": "Spending Report to Offer Clues About Consumers' Strength This Holiday Season; Government to release October figures on spending, inflation and income",
  "text": "<p>An October household spending report will show how consumers fared as the holiday season approached, with high inflation and rising interest rates weighing on the economy.</p><p>The Commerce Department will release spending, income and inflation figures at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday. The report will offer a broad picture of consumer health, with spending trends on services such as travel, housing and utilities.</p><p>\"Households are heading into the holiday season in fairly good shape,\" said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. He said that he expects that \"all in all, it's going to be another solid holiday shopping season, with unemployment low and wage growth still solid.\"</p><p>Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimated that consumer spending grew 0.8% in October, a pickup from the preceding month when it rose 0.6%. They also estimated that personal income rose steadily and inflation as measured by the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge—the personal-consumption expenditures price index—eased a little but remained high.</p><p>Consumers have spent robustly in recent months, despite persistently higher prices and rising borrowing costs from the Fed's campaign against inflation. Spending on services has been particularly strong as Americans caught up on travel and experiences they missed out on during the pandemic.</p><p>A still-tight labor market, with high demand for workers and low unemployment, is helping fuel household spending, though companies in the tech, entertainment and real-estate industries have announced a wave of layoffs in recent weeks.</p><p>Solid consumer spending helped drive third-quarter U.S. growth, which the government on Wednesday said was stronger than initially estimated. Retail spending rose sharply in October, and shoppers spent more over the post-Thanksgiving weekend this year than the year before.</p><p>There are signs that consumer spending—the main driver of economic growth—could be reaching a limit, however.</p><p>Household spending rose faster than incomes in August and September, a sign more people are dipping into savings or taking on credit-card debt to keep up spending amid high inflation. The personal-saving rate, the portion of after-tax income that consumers don't spend, in recent months has fallen to its lowest levels since 2008.</p><p>Shoppers, meanwhile, pulled back on discretionary spending and used savings to make purchases, executives from retailers including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. said recently.</p><p>A Fed report released Wednesday suggested that U.S. economic growth eased this fall, with business activity in some parts of the country stalling or declining. Businesses also expressed greater uncertainty and increased pessimism for the U.S. economy as prices and interest rates continue to rise, according to the central bank's latest compilation of economic anecdotes from around the country, known as the Beige Book.</p><p>Consumer sentiment deteriorated in both October and November, according to the Conference Board, a business research group, which said Tuesday that \"the economy has lost momentum as the year winds down.\"</p><p>Gunnar Jackson, 27 years old, treated himself to vacations this year in Vail, Colo., and Washington, D.C., after building up savings during the pandemic, most of which he used separately for a down payment on an investment property.</p><p>\"I could save more than I am, but also after having a year or two in lockdown and not being able to do what I want, there's more of a desire to do what I want,\" said Mr. Jackson, a project manager for a general contractor in Memphis, Tenn.</p><p>He said he isn't saving as much now. He also is changing spending habits because of rising prices, by dining out less and cooking in, preparing meals in bulk on the weekends.</p><p>Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com</p><p>Spending Report to Offer Clues About Consumers' Strength This Holiday Season</p>",
