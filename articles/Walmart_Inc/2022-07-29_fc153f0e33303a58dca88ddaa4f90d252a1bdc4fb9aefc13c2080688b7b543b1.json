  "title": "Luxury Brands Send a Confusing Economic Signal; Consumer confidence is at record lows in the eurozone and isn't great in the U.S., yet demand for expensive handbags and jewelry is off the charts",
  "text": "<p>Other European names reported similar trends earlier this week. Christian Dior's owner LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said sales increased by 21% year over year in the half. Kering grew by 16%, although its Gucci brand, which generates the lion's share of group profit, looked a bit weak in the U.S.</p><p>Spending by Americans and Europeans is roaring, despite headlines of all-time-low consumer sentiment in the eurozone and greater caution in the U.S. Many luxury brands have more than doubled the size of their sales in America compared with prepandemic levels. And boutiques in Paris and Milan are now full of U.S. tourists taking advantage of the euro's weakness relative to the dollar.</p><p>Because of their wealthier customers, demand for luxury brands might be more immune to the challenges other businesses now face. Walmart recently said shoppers have pared back on clothing, and Amazon.com's results this week showed a slowdown in e-commerce spending.</p><p>U.S. credit card data from Bank of America does show that shoppers earning less than $50,000 a year, who powered luxury sales in 2021, are rethinking their priorities as food and gasoline prices increase. But this has been more than offset by demand from core luxury spenders.</p><p>Unusually, recent stock-market falls haven't made luxury shoppers cautious. The S&amp;P 500 is off 14% this year, while the S&amp;P China 500 index is down almost a fifth. However, property markets, which have an impact on the wealth effect that drives spending on goods nobody needs, have been resilient. House prices are still close to record highs in the U.S., despite rising interest rates. A mortgage boycott by Chinese home buyers is causing jitters but no crash so far. Chinese households in particular have a large share of their wealth tied up in real estate.</p><p>Investors have been nervous about how long the spending spree can continue, but appear to be reassured by the latest earnings. On Friday, Hermès shares gained 8% in early trading—an unusually big swing for a stock traditionally seen as a haven. Over the past decade, the stock has closed up more than 5% only a dozen times.</p><p>It is counterintuitive that the ultimate discretionary purchase might be defensive in a downturn. So far, it is hard to find evidence otherwise.</p><p>Write to Carol Ryan at carol.ryan@wsj.com</p><p>Luxury Brands Send a Confusing Economic Signal</p>",
