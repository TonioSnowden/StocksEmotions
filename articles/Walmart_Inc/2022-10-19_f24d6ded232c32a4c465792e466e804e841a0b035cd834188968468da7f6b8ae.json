There's been a bit of \"moderating or disinflating\" in proteins, and there's also been \"some deflation\" in televisions and the broader world of consumer electronics, he said.</p><p>Walmart next reports earnings Nov. 15.</p><p>Walmart is still seeing 'strong' demand and spending, its U.S. CEO says</p>",
