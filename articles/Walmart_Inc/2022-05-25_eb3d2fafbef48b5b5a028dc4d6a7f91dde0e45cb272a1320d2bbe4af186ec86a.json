  "text": "<p>On a conference call Wednesday, executives said they were being cautious given the uncertain macroeconomic situation but that they hadn't seen big shifts in consumer spending. Executives said they haven't had to resort to additional discounting to sell items.</p><p>\"The marketplace has not shifted dramatically in any meaningful way,\" CEO Lauren Hobart told analysts. \"We are just being appropriately cautious as we look toward a lot of things that are outside of our control when we look at the rest of the year.\"</p><p>Ms. Hobart said a 40% increase in inventory levels at Dick's was healthy and there were areas where she wished the company could find even more goods to sell. \"We are still chasing products in certain categories,\" she said. \"We are not anticipating any significant markdown risk.\"</p><p>Shares of Dick's rose about 10% in afternoon trading Wednesday, after falling earlier in the session with the earnings release. Before the quarterly report, the shares had dropped nearly 40% year to date.</p><p>Retailers across the sector have said that consumer demand waned in the recent quarter without the spending boost from last year's government stimulus. Inflation has curbed consumer spending and squeezed profit margins that are already under pressure from continuing supply-chain disruptions and rising shipping costs.</p><p>Dick's new forecast calls for same-store sales to fall between 2% and 8% this year, compared with an earlier projection of being flat to down 4%. Per-share earnings adjusted for certain items are expected to be between $9.15 and $11.70, compared with the company's prior guidance of $11.70 to $13.10.</p><p>Even major retailers, including Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., that posted higher first-quarter saleshave been caught up in a major selloff of retail stocks as they face higher costs and less demand for higher-margin discretionary items.</p><p>For the quarter ended April 30, Dick's reported earnings of $260.6 million, or $2.47 a share, down from $361.8 million, or $3.41 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were $2.85 a share, above Wall Street expectations of $2.52, according to FactSet.</p><p>Revenue came in at $2.7 billion, down from $2.9 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting $2.6 billion.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>Dick's Lowers Sales Goals but Says Consumer Spending Still Strong</p>",
