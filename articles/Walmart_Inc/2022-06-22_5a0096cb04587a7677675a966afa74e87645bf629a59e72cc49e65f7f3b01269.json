  "title": "One Price Dodging Inflation: China-to-U.S. Shipping Rates; Freight costs are down by a third since the start of the year as some importers cut orders",
  "text": "<p>Business is brisk at U.S. ports, as container shippers handle orders from retailers bringing in merchandise for the back-to-school selling season and late-year holidays. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., the two biggest U.S. import gateways, handled a combined 936,937 containers last month, the highest monthly volume since May 2021, a record month.</p><p>\"We may look for better deals, buy burgers instead of steaks, but we are still buying,\" said Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. \"Rates depend on supply and demand, and people are still looking for container space wherever they can get it.\"</p><p>Supply chains have been rattled over the past two years as a result of Covid-19 infections world-wide, as well as sharp changes in consumer-buying habits during the pandemic. Earlier in the health crisis, retailers and other companies began to load up on inventory as consumers—bolstered by their savings and government stimulus—increased their purchases of goods.</p><p>The surge in order volumes helped push ocean shipping rates—and profits for liners—to record levels. It also exacerbated port bottlenecks and shortages of containers, freight trains, truck drivers and warehouse space. Container ships move more than 95% of the world's manufactured goods.</p><p>Some companies have cut orders with vendors, and retailers such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. said they were dealing with excess inventory because of over ordering. Retailers' inventory levels have increased by dollar value, but an important performance ratio—inventory to sales—remains low because of customer demand, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade group.</p><p>\"As long as consumers continue to buy at a record pace, retailers will need to continue stockpiling goods to meet the extremely high levels of demand,\" said NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay.</p><p>Prospects for activity to remain at current levels are murky. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are among groups that have slashed their forecasts on global economic growth amid the war in Ukraine, recent Covid-19 lockdowns in China and rising food and energy prices.</p><p>Inbound container volumes across the 10 largest U.S. ports have fallen by an average of 25% since May, according to liners and terminal operators. Port operators are gradually clearing up their container depots, and the line of ships waiting to dock outside Los Angeles and Long Beach was down to 22 ships last week from 109 in January, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California.</p><p>Industry analysts aren't expecting freight rates to fall in tandem. Capacity is still tight as nearly all available container ships are sailing and deliveries of new ones aren't slated to begin until next year. Big liners and charterers also have contracts beyond this year with many of their customers, companies say.</p><p>As fuel prices rise, shipowners are expected to add or increase surcharges to help defray the expense. Bunker fuel prices are now at $670 a ton, 80% higher than before the pandemic, according to bunkering data by London-based shipping adviser Braemar.</p><p>\"The test for freight rates will come in a few weeks when the peak season is in full swing,\" said Lars Jensen, CEO of Denmark-based Vespucci Maritime. \"If spot rates don't go up in the summer, it will be a strong sign that demand is falling. This means lower rates going forward but not falling off a cliff.\"</p><p>The shipping alliances boxship operators have formed in recent years enable them to share ships and port calls, making it easier to control capacity and keep freight levels stable.</p><p>\"Although we've probably seen the worst in port congestion, Asia is still not completely open and Americans are still buying. Container ships continue to be a quite safe bet, with strong returns for at least another year,\" said Evangelos Marinakis, the chairman of Athens-based Capital Maritime Group, which runs 42 boxships that can move 230,000 containers.</p><p>Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com</p><p>One Price Dodging Inflation: China-to-U.S. Shipping Rates</p>",
