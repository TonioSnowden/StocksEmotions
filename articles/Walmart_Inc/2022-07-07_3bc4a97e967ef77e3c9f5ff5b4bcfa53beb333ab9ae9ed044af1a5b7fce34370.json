  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Amazon is the kind of dining partner that should help Grubhub get looks from the rest of the room. </p><p>\n  On Wednesday, Grubhub's owner Just Eat Takeaway.com said it signed a deal to offer Amazon Prime members in the U.S. a free one-year trial of its Grubhub+ membership plan. Diners can order online food takeout with no delivery fees, a service that would normally cost $9.99 a month. JET rose more than 13% in the U.S., though it is down almost two-thirds this year. </p><p>\n  Grubhub has been losing market share in the U.S. for some time. It went from being the No. 1 food-takeout app to holding a 14% market share, behind DoorDash with 59% and Uber Eats with 27%, according to Bank of America. </p><p>\n  Teaming up with Amazon is a smart way for Grubhub to tackle this problem without spending too much. In return for access to its millions of Prime subscribers, the tech giant will get warrants for 2% of Grubhub's equity, and an additional 13% if performance targets are met. JET thinks the partnership will boost Grubhub's earnings from next year. </p><p>\n  The alternative for Grubhub would be an expensive ad campaign when investors are worried about losses. And the partnership gives the company access to diners at home. Before the pandemic, Grubhub was more reliant on orders from office employees than its rivals, a business that hasn't fully recovered due to the shift to remote working. </p><p>\n  A similar deal between Amazon and London-listed takeout app Deliveroo was successful. After offering Amazon's U.K. Prime members unlimited free delivery, subscriptions for Deliveroo's loyalty program in that market quadrupled year over year by March 2022, UBS notes. The U.S. tech company previously took a 16% stake in the British startup. </p><p>\n  Ideally, JET would sell Grubhub outright. Activist investor Cat Rock Capital suggested in November that Amazon, Walmart or Instacart could buy the business. But a year after JET's $4.3 billion all-share takeover of Grubhub closed, analysts at Berenberg think the U.S. brand would fetch around $1 billion. Grubhub's founder and former chief executive Matt Maloney may be teaming up with private-equity firms for an offer in that ballpark, according to reports. A takeover by a big U.S. rival, who might find synergies to justify paying more, is unlikely due to antitrust rules. </p><p>\n  The partnership probably isn't a prelude to a takeover by Amazon, at least if Deliveroo's experience is anything to go by: The tech company was happy to let its stake be diluted in the startup's initial public offering last year. But if access to Amazon's U.S. consumer base helps Grubhub to improve sales, that is still a positive for shareholders. </p><p></p>",
