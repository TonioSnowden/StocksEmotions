  "text": "<p>Public-health officials say it's the clearest route to herd immunity, where the most vulnerable in the population are protected against COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and to stop the spread of potentially more severe variants.</p><p>Currently, approximately 64% of the U.S. population is vaccinated against the virus — over 212 million people — and roughly 42% have received a booster shot, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Vermont has the highest percentage of people who received the booster (57.4%) and New Hampshire has the lowest (19.7%). As we brace for Year 3 of the pandemic, COVID-19 has&#xa0;killed 898,2168&#xa0;Americans.</p><p>In fact, deaths are now averaging 2,597 per day in the U.S., a 21% increase over 14 days, according to the&#xa0;New York Times tracker.&#xa0;Daily deaths are now&#xa0;higher than the peak last fall&#xa0;when the more virulent delta variant was dominant.</p><p>Two texts, three days apart</p><p>This study of 689,693 customers from 4,700 Walmart pharmacies, published in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, set out to discover the best way to “nudge” people to get vaccinated.</p><p>Using the flu vaccine as their subject, the researchers tested 22 different text reminders using a slew of behavioral science principles. These texts increased vaccination rates by an average of 2 percentage points (6.8%).</p><p>Their No. 1 method of persuasion was both persistent, yet friendly. It didn't tell them what to do, but it did gently remind them that there was a shot with their name on it at their local pharmacy.</p><p>“The top-performing intervention included two texts three days apart and stated that a vaccine was ‘waiting for you,'” it found. “Forecasters failed to anticipate that this would be the best-performing treatment, underscoring the value of testing.”</p><p>These findings, the researchers wrote, “can potentially inform efforts by pharmacies and hopefully also providers and governments around the world in the ongoing campaign to encourage full vaccination against COVID-19.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/katy_milkman/status/1488861888448372738?s=20&amp;t=NsRk_0F8OFGAeUb_gdGyYA</p>",
