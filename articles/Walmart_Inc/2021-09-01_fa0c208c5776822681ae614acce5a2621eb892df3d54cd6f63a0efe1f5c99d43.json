  "title": "The Afghanistan Crisis: Aid Groups Mobilize to Help Refugees --- Agencies that reduced budgets, staff in recent years race to sign on workers, raise money",
  "text": "<p>Some leaders of those groups say the government hasn't provided precise figures on how many Afghans the organizations should be expecting to take on -- or how quickly those people will arrive. The Department of Homeland Security, the lead agency coordinating the resettlement effort, didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>Resettlement-agency leaders held a call Sunday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in which he pledged his cooperation but mostly listened to the issues raised, according to two people on the call.</p><p>The groups also don't know which of the arriving Afghans will come with approved Special Immigrant Visas, which entitle them toa panoply of services, including months of healthcare and food assistance. The visa program was designed for Afghans who worked alongside the U.S. military during the two-decade war.</p><p>The government has told agencies to expect as many as 50,000 Afghans to arrive without visas, meaning that without a change to the law their resettlement will rely much more heavily on private donations.</p><p>\"We're going to make it work, no matter how difficult, but I'd be lying to you if I said we aren't concerned,\" said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, one of the contracted resettlement agencies.</p><p>The effort would be a heavy lift under any circumstance but is made all the more challenging because of cutbacks the nine resettlement agencies say they were forced to make under former President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump had accepted a record low number of refugees each of the years he was in office.</p><p>The agencies, most of which are affiliated with religious denominations, are paid by the U.S. government according to how many refugees they resettle. Under the Trump administration, they collectively closed about a third of their offices, according to Refugee Council USA. The low resettlement numbers meant that many of the relationships that organizations maintain -- with landlords willing to rent to new arrivals and businesses willing to hire refugees -- also atrophied.</p><p>But while the organizations are lacking in resources, they say they are making up for it in surging interest from ordinary Americans coming forward to donate their time, goods and even spare rooms to assist the effort.</p><p>Major U.S. companies have also made offers to help, with Airbnb Inc. pledging to house up to 20,000 Afghan refugees world-wide and Walmart Inc. promising $1 million to refugee groups.</p>",
