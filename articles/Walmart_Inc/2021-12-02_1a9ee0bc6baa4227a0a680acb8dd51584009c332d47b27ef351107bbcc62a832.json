  "title": "Consumers Eating at Home Lead to Higher Sales at Kroger; Grocery chain raises full-year guidance, but says costs are increasing because of transportation, other supply-chain costs",
  "text": "<p>Kroger said net profit attributable to the company was $483 million, down from $631 million a year earlier. Earnings were 64 cents on a per-share basis, compared with 80 cents last year.</p><p>Kroger and other food retailers are recording lower profits, partly because they say they are spending more on sourcing and delivering products. Companies say they continue to wrestle with persisting shortages across a range of items such as pet food and beverages, and are spending more on freight, warehousing and labor to keep their shelves stocked.</p><p>Supply-chain challenges have improved slightly in recent weeks but haven't bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, industry executives say. Supermarket executives say they are securing food from a wider network of suppliers and storing more inventory to work ahead of supply issues.</p><p>These efforts are adding to overall costs in the U.S., fueling the highest inflation in three decades. Grocery prices rose 5.4% in October from a year ago, with meat, poultry, fish and eggs increasing 11.9%. Pork prices climbed 14.1%, the highest annual increase since 1990. As meat prices remain high, consumers are switching to cheaper types of meator store brands and retailers are anticipating more shoppers to seek bargains in the coming months.</p><p>Still, consumer spending remains strong, executives say, and grocery sales are higher than they were before the pandemic, as people continue to work remotely and cook more at home.</p><p>Kroger's shares rose about 11% at $44.64 Thursday morning.</p><p>Executives from Kroger, Walmart Inc. and other big retailers met with President Biden earlier this week to discuss the supply chain. Also this week, the Federal Trade Commission said it is seeking information from grocers and retailers about how they are managing supply-chain challenges as the agency looks into higher prices and anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>The new Covid-19 variantis causing concern among supermarkets that rely on consumer-facing workers and are trying to keep up with steady demand. Some companies say they are waiting for more clarity on the Omicron variant before imposing major changes and are also standing by to see how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's vaccine requirement will shake out. Many say they worry that either, or both, could worsen worker shortages.</p><p>Kroger raised its adjusted earnings for the year to around $3.40 to $3.50 a share from $3.25 to $3.35 a share as it earlier projected.</p><p>Merchandise costs, which includes advertising, warehousing and transportation, rose 9% from last year to $25 billion.</p><p>Write to Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com and Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>Consumers Eating at Home Lead to Higher Sales at Kroger</p>",
