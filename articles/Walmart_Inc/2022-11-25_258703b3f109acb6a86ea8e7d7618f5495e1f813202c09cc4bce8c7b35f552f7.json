  "text": "<p>Mr. Bing—who had worked at Walmart since 2010, according to the company—left a \"death note\" that police said they retrieved from his cellphone. In it, he wrote, \"I was harassed by idiots with low intelligence and a lack of wisdom,\" and \"I remained strong through most of the torment but my dignity was completely taken away beyond repair.\"</p><p>A representative for Walmart didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Apparently referring to some co-workers, Mr. Bing wrote, \"They laughed at me and said that I was like Jeffrey Dahmer,\" a serial killer who murdered people between the 1970s and 1990s. Mr. Bing said one person \"had been trying to get rid of me since day one,\" he wrote in a note in which police appeared to redact named individuals. \"After I heard that I lashed out.\"</p><p>He added: \"The associates gave me evil twisted grins, mocked me and celebrated my down fall.\"</p><p>The note also includes references to his phone allegedly getting hacked. Two former co-workers of Mr. Bing said in interviews that he would cover his cellphone camera with tape because he was worried the government was tracking him, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. He could be aggressive and difficult to work with, they said.</p><p>Police said Mr. Bing had no criminal history. A search of his house yielded a box of ammunition and a receipt and other paperwork related to the purchase of the 9mm handgun, they said.</p><p>Police on Wednesday identified five of the dead victims as Lorenzo Gamble, Brian Pendleton, Kellie Pyle, Randall Blevins and Tyneka Johnson. The name of a 16-year-old male victim wasn't released because he was a minor. All six were Walmart associates, a company spokesman said earlier.</p><p>Several other people were injured in the shooting. As of Friday, two of them remained hospitalized, one in critical condition and the other in fair and improving condition, according to police.</p><p>Write to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Virginia Walmart Shooting Suspect Claimed Co-Workers Harassed Him, Police Say</p>",
