  "title": "Planners Battle Over Marking U.S. 250th Anniversary; The federal effort to commemorate 2026, mired in dissension, faces allegations of impropriety",
  "text": "<p>The foundation, the commission and an affiliated nonprofit—collectively called America250—were sued on discrimination claims last month by four female former executives of the foundation who allege they were effectively forced out by the \"boys club\" running the project after objecting to what their lawsuit says was \"cronyism, self-dealing, mismanagement of funds, potentially unlawful contracting practices and wasteful spending.\" The foundation denies the allegations.</p><p>With Mr. DiLella's leadership under fire, his allies put forward a resolution that augments his power, reduces public access to official proceedings and limits members' ability to vote on budget and planning issues or speak at commission meetings. Mr. DiLella convened the March 9 session over Zoom and proceeded to a vote without debate.</p><p>Several commissioners, including some members of Congress, sought to speak, people who attended said. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D., N.J.) held up a sign reading, \"I Demand to Be Heard.\" Mr. DiLella ignored both her and Rep. Robert Aderholt (R., Ala.), who also asked to speak, said former Rep. Joseph Crowley (D., N.Y.), who serves on the commission as a private citizen.</p><p>\"What was done was very authoritarian and not at all in the Spirit of '76,\" Mr. Crowley said. Mr. DiLella has said the changes would make America250 operate more like a business, people who spoke with him said.</p><p>Some members say Mr. DiLella should step down.</p><p>\"We've suffered through four years of these antics with no vision at all for 2026,\" said Commissioner Andrew Hohns, chief executive of Philadelphia investment firm Newmarket Capital. \"There has been little to no focus on the hard work of historic preservation, capital and community investment, and planning for the celebration or building its legacy.\"</p><p>Mr. DiLella, chief executive of Equus Capital Partners Ltd., declined interview requests.</p><p>\"We have hit many roadblocks along the way, and there may be more,\" he said through a spokesman, \"but we are on the right path to fulfill our sacred mission to honor this great country.\"</p><p>America250's tentative plans include an online showcase of attractions such as the Sturgis, S.D., motorcycle rally and the park in the Compton, Calif., area where Serena and Venus Williams learned to play tennis, according to a presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Also proposed are a Young People's Continental Congress and a television cooking show called \"The Great American Mixing Bowl.\" A National Semiquincentennial Convention that assembles \"delegates from every corner of the USA to engage in constructive dialogue regarding our country's next 250 years\" would cap the project, the presentation says.</p><p>The foundation, which was chartered to raise funds for the commission, set a fundraising goal of $250 million, with a $10 million target for this year and $50 million in 2023, according to a March report viewed by the Journal. It has had little success so far in lining up corporate sponsors. Walmart Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Bank of America Corp. were approached but have made no commitments, people familiar with the matter say. A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment; representatives of Walmart and Home Depot didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is the sole national sponsor to date, agreeing to provide $10 million over five years in exchange for a role in planning and presenting the observances; after the discrimination allegations were reported, Meta said it was reviewing the arrangement.</p><p>Meta has provided $2 million so far, making the company the foundation's second-biggest funding source. The first is the commission itself, which has transferred $11.8 million to the foundation, according to a December internal report viewed by the Journal.</p><p>Congress established the Semiquincentennial Commission in 2016 and has so far allotted nearly $30 million for planning and events leading to July 4, 2026. Eight lawmakers and 16 private citizens, appointed in equal numbers by Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, make up the voting members. Cabinet secretaries, heads of federal institutions such as the Smithsonian and retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy hold nonvoting seats.</p><p>The Semiquincentennial's troubles recall those of the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, assigned in 1966 to plan for the 200th anniversary. Congress scrapped the panel in 1973 in the midst of allegations of political favoritism, commercialism and mismanagement. President Richard Nixon tapped Navy Secretary John Warner to salvage a scaled-down observance ahead of July 4, 1976.</p><p>While the Bicentennial project was the subject of presidential addresses, congressional hearings and newspaper investigations, Semiquincentennial planning has attracted little attention. Some say that is partly because Mr. DiLella has given leadership roles to his connections in the Philadelphia business community who lack expertise in public history or planning events on the scale of a world's fair or the Olympic Games.</p><p>Mr. DiLella named his friend Frank Giordano as the commission's executive director, at a $156,000 government salary, disregarding an early commission vote to conduct a nationwide search. Mr. Giordano holds two other jobs: chief executive of both Encore Series Inc., producer of the Philly Pops, and his family business, Atlantic Trailer Leasing Corp. He sits with Mr. DiLella on the boards of Encore Series, the National Italian American Foundation and Roman Catholic High School, which Mr. DiLella attended. Both men are past presidents of the Union League of Philadelphia, a private club, and remain board members.</p><p>According to the former employees' lawsuit, Mr. Giordano works for the Semiquincentennial about 10 hours a week. An America250 spokesman said he works 40 hours. The spokesman issued a statement saying that Mr. DiLella acted within his powers as chairman. \"Any inference that Mr. Giordano's appointment was not in conformity with law is not based in fact or law,\" the statement said.</p><p>Mr. Giordano didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Foundation counsel Thomas McGarrigle sits on the Union League board too, as does commission counsel Joseph Del Raso, who is also on the Encore Series and Italian American boards.</p><p>Mr. McGarrigle didn't respond to a request for comment, but his law firm, Reed Smith, said in a statement that its lawyers had provided hundreds of hours of pro bono work in the foundation's early days. \"Since the Foundation has received funding, the firm continues to provide representation when requested at significantly reduced hourly rates,\" the firm said.</p><p>Mr. Del Raso didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. DiLella hired the daughter of his firm's vice president as director of communications and operations in his commission chairman's office, and a former Equus intern for a similar job in his separate capacity as foundation chairman. Mr. DiLella, who attended Villanova University, endowed a real-estate center there and serves on the school's board of trustees, has brought on several of its alumni: Mr. McGarrigle, Mr. Del Raso and the two chairman's aides all are graduates, as is Richard Subbio, the commission's government-relations director.</p><p>Mr. DiLella selected Maven Communications, which does publicity for his company, to handle America250's public relations. According to the December report, Maven has received $610,000 so far. Rebecca Devine, its co-founder, is Mr. DiLella's colleague on the Roman Catholic High School board. Mrs. Devine didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How should the 250th anniversary of the United States be commemorated? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. DiLella was appointed to the commission in 2017 on advice of Sen. Patrick Toomey (R., Pa.), who also serves as a commissioner. A year later, President Donald Trump named Mr. DiLella chairman.</p><p>Last year President Biden renewed Mr. DiLella's chairmanship at the urging of Commissioner David Cohen, a former Comcast Corp. executive who now serves as ambassador to Canada, people familiar with the matter say.</p><p>\"The president chose to redesignate Dan DiLella based on several recommendations from people who know him and his work,\" a White House official said.</p><p>Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin+1@wsj.com</p><p>Planners Battle Over Marking U.S. 250th Anniversary</p>",
