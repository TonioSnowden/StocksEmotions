  "text": "<p>During the past two quarters, cash-back cards offered an average 1.11% per dollar spent, up from 1.08% in the beginning of the year and the highest level since at least 2010, according to WalletHub.com. Miles or points offered have reached their highest level in over a decade, at 1.2 miles or points per dollar spent.</p><p>Banks are venturing in new directions to appeal to a broader set of consumers. Capital One Financial Corp., known for subprime and travel-rewards credit cards with modest annual fees, launched Venture X, a $395-a-year card that comes with access to its first airport lounge. American Express Co. recently added a benefit for Walmart Inc. shoppers to its Platinum card that has a $695 annual fee.</p><p>Nearly every card issuer has the same goal: to find cardholders with good credit scores who will carry balances. These customers are among the most lucrative for banks, and their absence is keenly felt. Big banks' credit-card profitability fell last year to the lowest level since 2009, according to the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Credit-card spending declined sharply in the early days of the pandemic, when travel was off limits and restaurants were closed. Balances on general-purpose and store credit cards went in the same direction, falling by $166 billion from January 2020 through April 2021, according to credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc. Many cardholders closed their accounts altogether. The total number of open credit cards in the U.S. fell 7% from January 2020 to March 2021.</p><p>Credit-card spending has since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Balances have not.</p><p>Visa said spending on its U.S. credit cards increased 20% to $622 billion during the last quarter compared with a year prior. Some 40.4 million general-purpose credit cards were issued during the first seven months of this year, an 83% increase from last year, according to Equifax. Credit-card balances on general-purpose and store credit cards in the U.S. increased 5% to $784 billion from this past April, when they bottomed out, to September, according to Equifax. Balances continued to rise in October, card issuers said.</p><p>America's two biggest banks -- JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. -- said credit-card purchase volume during the third quarter increased 30% and 26%, respectively, from a year earlier. Card balances increased by about 2% at JPMorgan and fell 4% at Bank of America.</p><p>A decline in credit-card debt is, of course, a good thing for consumers. Smaller balances mean lower interest payments and less risk of credit-damaging defaults. Missed payments on credit cards remain near record-low levels.</p><p>Banks say many people have the ability to pay their card bills in full because of their higher-than-usual savings. They expect that to decline as stimulus money runs out and people revert to their pre-pandemic spending habits.</p><p>Banks, meanwhile, hope spending now will pay off in the future. There tends to be a lag between account openings and rising balances, issuers say, and pent-up demand means consumers are primed to spend.</p><p>AmEx marketing spending increased 26% in the third quarter from a year prior to $1.4 billion. Earlier this year, the company said it expected to spend more than $5 billion on marketing in 2021. The company says a small portion of its revenue comes from interest charges.</p><p>Capital One's marketing spending soared 165% in the third quarter from a year earlier, with card marketing being \"the biggest driver of total company marketing trends,\" Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said on the bank's most recent earnings call.</p><p>Marketing expenses at Discover Financial Services rose 50% in the third quarter from a year earlier. New credit-card account openings in the first nine months of this year rose 27% from the same period a year earlier, but balances were up only about 1%.</p><p>\"The efforts we're putting towards getting new accounts are close to entirely offset by elevated payment rates,\" said Discover Chief Executive Roger Hochschild. The company expects cardholder-payment rates to fall to pre-pandemic levels in 2023.</p>",
