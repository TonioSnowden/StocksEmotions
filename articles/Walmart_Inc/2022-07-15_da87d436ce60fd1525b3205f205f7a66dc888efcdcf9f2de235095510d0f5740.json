  "text": "<p>Wordle, which offers players six tries a day to guess a five-letter word, was created by Josh Wardle, a software engineer from New York. He created a prototype for the game in 2013 before resurrecting it during the pandemic for his partner, who enjoys word games.</p><p>When the Times bought Wordle in January for a price \"in the low-seven figures,\" Mr. Wardle said the game \"has gotten bigger than I ever imagined.\"</p><p>Now the Times is betting that Wordle's success will translate from the screen to the physical world.</p><p>The board-game version of Wordle comes with dry-erase boards on which users mark down a secret word devised by one of the players, the Times and Hasbro said in a joint statement Thursday. The player who needs the fewest guesses wins.</p><p>Until its October launch, the board game is available to preorder in North America for $19.99, the Times and Hasbro said. The board game will be sold by Hasbro, Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Walmart Inc.</p><p>A Times spokeswoman said Friday that \"Wordle: The Party Game\" was the first board game the company was set to release in years. It previously had crossword board games in 1985 and 1997, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>Wordle has spawned a number of spinoff versions since its launch, including Cloudle, which challenges players to guess a city's weather forecast, and Subwaydle, a New York-subway themed puzzle.</p><p>Spotify Technology SA said Tuesday that it was acquiring Heardle, a game in which players have six tries to guess a song title based on its opening notes. Spotify didn't disclose deal terms.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>Attention Wordle Fans, the Viral Sensation Is Becoming a Board Game</p>",
