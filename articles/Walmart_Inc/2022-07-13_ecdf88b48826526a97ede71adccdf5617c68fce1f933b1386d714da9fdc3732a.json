  "text": "<p>Inflation ran hot last month. It might be about to look cooler, though perhaps not cool enough.</p><p>The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.3% in June from a month earlier, putting them 9.1% higher than a year earlier. That marked the highest pace of inflation since November 1981. A lot of the gain was driven by the jump in gasoline prices: Core prices, which exclude food and energy items in an effort to better track inflation's trend, were up 5.9% from a year earlier. That was down a touch from May's 6%, and from March's multidecade high of 6.5%, but is still way too warm for anyone's comfort.</p><p>The inflation report cemented expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will raise their target range on overnight rates by three-quarters of a percentage point when they meet in two weeks. That shifts investors' focus to what might happen at the Fed's subsequent policy-setting meeting in late September. By then, the picture could look different, as prices for many of the things that pushed inflation higher have lately shown signs of turning over.</p><p>Start with gasoline. The average price of a gallon of regular in June was $4.93, according to the Energy Information Administration, up from $4.44 in May. But pump prices have been falling, with regular fetching $4.65 as of Monday. And to judge by the decline in gasoline-futures prices since last month, further price declines are probably coming.</p><p>Prices for a variety of other inflation drivers have also been falling. The S&amp;P GSCI agriculture index, which includes crops such as corn and cocoa, has fallen by a quarter since its May peak, while the industrial-metals index has fallen by a third. Wholesale used-vehicle prices slipped in June from May, according to Manheim, which should lead to lower prices on dealer lots.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How concerned are you about inflation over the next year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Meanwhile, excess inventories are leading retailers such as Walmart and Target to put more items on sale. For many of the goods that Americans loaded up on since the pandemic struck, such as appliances and furniture, there should be markedly less inflation, or outright price declines, in the months ahead.</p><p>The degree to which inflation cools, and how the Fed might respond, is the big question. Price relief won't be showing up everywhere. Rent increases have been steep, and because the Labor Department uses rents to impute homeowners' shelter costs, the effect will be pronounced. Rents and imputed rents account for 31% of consumer spending, by the Labor Department's measure, and 40% of core spending. These rent effects won't be as large in the Fed's preferred inflation measure from the Commerce Department, which puts a lower weighting on shelter costs, but they could still be strong enough to keep inflation elevated.</p><p>Moreover, even if the inflation readings come down markedly, the Fed may worry the reprieve is only temporary. If the job market is still strong, policy makers might conclude first that rising wages could put lasting upward pressure on prices, and second that the economy has enough underlying strength to weather more rate increases. Investors hoping for a reprieve from the Fed will have to wait a while yet.</p><p>Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com</p><p>Inflation May Have Peaked, but the Fed Won't Back Off</p>",
