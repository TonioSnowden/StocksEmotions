  "text": "<p>I applaud the efforts of many of your readers and journalists to address sustainability, but could we not all reduce our impact on the environment by being more patient about receiving packages? How many things do we actually need shipped overnight or even in two to three days? I recently ordered a few items from Walmart. In the pursuit of free shipping, I ordered $35 worth of merchandise, expecting it all to come together, which makes logistic sense. Instead I got numerous random deliveries, which burnt fossil fuel each time and necessitated a surfeit of packing supplies (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfafff92-9e37-4fa4-ab29-ba4c6ea4f1ef\">July 20</a>). </p> <p>On a global scale, cargo ships burn less fuel if they travel more slowly, but consumer demand for goods means full speed ahead is often chosen over a more efficient method of transport. </p> <p><strong>Catherine Lau</strong> <br><em>Longmont, CO, US </em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Online shopping delivery is getting out of hand' FT.com 11 August.
