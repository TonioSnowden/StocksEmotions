The U.S. and its allies have accused Russia of planning to use false reports of attacks on separatists as a pretext for an invasion. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Russia has filed a report with the United Nations alleging that Ukraine's military has committed “crimes” against residents of the eastern Donbas region.</p><p>“This is likely to be the bigger concern for NATO and the U.S., if separatist forces try and goad Ukrainian forces into a counter-response, thus creating an excuse for a Russian incursion, and for all hell to break loose,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.</p><p>President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday morning that a Russian invasion could happen in the next “several days.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, addressing the U.N. Security Council, called on Russia to withdraw troops and to resume negotiations over security concerns.</p><p>Investors sifted through a batch of U.S. economic data, including a rise in first-time jobless claims, a January fall in housing starts and a fall in the Philadelphia Fed's regional manufacturing index.</p><p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who has called for more aggressive rate increases than his colleagues, on Thursday said too much “mindshare” has been devoted to the idea that inflation will moderate at some point.</p><p>Wednesday's minutes of the January Federal Reserve meeting provided few new details for investors who are now pricing about six interest rate increases this year, but investors are becoming concerned that the Fed may not be able to slow inflation without slowing the economy. Fed officials will have another round of inflation and employment data before making their decision next month.</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Tesla Inc.TSLA fell 5.1% after news that U.S. highway safety authorities opened up an investigation into “phantom braking.”</p><p>Shares of Walmart Inc.WMT were in focus, rising 4% after reporting fourth-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations and raising its dividend.</p><p>Palantir Technologies Inc.PLTRgrew revenue more quickly than anticipated in its latest quarter, though earnings per share fell short of expectations.
