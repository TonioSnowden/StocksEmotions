  "text": "<p>In the next couple of weeks, Dr. Kennedy will unveil her first product partnership, an \"all-in-one potty kit\" from Frida. A caricature of her face in gentle pastels appears on a printed guide tucked inside the toilet that parents remove from the bowl to read. The product, which incorporates Dr. Kennedy's preferred term \"potty learning\" instead of \"potty training,\" will be sold at retailers including Walmart, Target and Amazon.</p><p>Dr. Kennedy already sells $54 workshops and $23-a-month subscriptions on her website, or \"community,\" as she calls it. The platform, slickly designed by a former product manager from fashion site Rent the Runway, features video tutorials and suggested scripts for tough conversations with children. It launched five months ago and has nearly 15,000 members.</p><p>The 1.4 million followers on Dr. Kennedy's \"Good Inside\" Instagram account include celebrity moms like Gigi Hadid, Jennifer Garner and Eva Mendes. Blake Lively recently gushed about the book on her Instagram. Dr. Kennedy is planning Instagram Live spots with author Katherine Schwarzenegger, who is married to actor Chris Pratt, and Meena Harris, the niece of Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>Every decade, an Alpha parent seems to emerge. The 1980s introduced Heidi Murkoff's \"What To Expect\" empire of mom-to-mom advice (Sing to your baby in the womb! Don't forget to involve your partner!). In the 1990s, it was Dr. William Sears and \"Attachment Parenting\" (Let babies feed on demand! Let babies sleep in their parents' beds!).</p><p>In 2001, the baby whispering method was the gospel (Find your baby's personality type! Figure out what your baby is trying to tell you!).</p><p>In 2011, it was Amy Chua, author of the bestselling \"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,\" which had Americans trying to raise children with the discipline and high expectations of Chinese parents. Dr. Kennedy's style takes a new twist, focusing largely on empathy, curiosity and play.</p><p>The author sees an untapped market. If people are willing to hire personal trainers for their bodies, she argues, they should feel OK about paying for a parent coach, too.</p><p>\"It's insulting, it's patronizing, and it's really awful that the media would perpetuate an idea that parents don't deserve the resources and support that people in other important jobs get,\" said Dr. Kennedy, 39, who lives with her husband and three children ages 10, 7 and 5 on Manhattan's Upper West Side. \"'Good Inside' is so much bigger than 'Dr. Becky.'\"</p><p>Her Instagram account took off when working adults were trapped at home with their children during Covid. Moms and dads felt an urgent need for help and had the time to attempt her self-aware scripts, which hold that their kids are good people having a hard time. \"Remember, our kids are always absorbing the versions of themselves we reflect back,\" she cautions in the book.</p><p>Many adults raise their children as their own parents did, Dr. Kennedy writes, which is to say, they treat the job like animal training. The result, she argues, is parenting that fails to teach life lessons and raises future adults more likely to struggle with shame, lack of self-confidence and an inability to trust their own instincts.</p><p>Now parents are back in the office, kids are in school, and more third-party disciplinarians are delivering timeouts and demands for apologies, the exact opposite of Dr. Kennedy's method. (In fact, Dr. Kennedy suggests that parents might apologize on behalf of a reluctant child to model the behavior and then discuss it together later.)</p><p>It takes patience—and buy-in—to say to a child who won't listen: \"What if I talked while I was dancing around in circles, would that make it more enticing?\" Imagine a teacher saying some version of that line from the book 25 times a day.</p><p>\"People do often say that this parenting style takes time, but I think really it's just a matter of how we spend our time,\" Dr. Kennedy counters. \"Either we spend our time connecting to our child, or we spend our time managing resistance, power struggles and our own parent-guilt spirals.\"</p><p>Dr. Kennedy recently signed with a Hollywood agent. She has a jammed book tour that included a stop at Glennon Doyle's \"We Can Do Hard Things\" podcast, where she made co-host Abby Wambach cry three times in the first half-hour. The aim is to re-parent not just kids, but their parents, too, she says. On the morning show \"Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna,\" Dr. Kennedy declared parents \"rock stars\" for trying their best. Co-host Jenna Bush Hager told her, \"We feel better already.\"</p><p>This summer, Dr. Kennedy met with fellow mom Gwyneth Paltrow in the Hamptons on Long Island, N.Y., where they recorded an episode of Ms. Paltrow's \"Goop\" podcast.</p><p>On the show, Ms. Paltrow turned confessional, asking Dr. Kennedy for help balancing discipline with support for a child's unique personhood. \"I was really a stickler about manners, and so was my kids' dad,\" Ms. Paltrow said. \"But when they were pushing back, if I look at it through that lens of like, 'Wow, I'm really projecting this existing social paradigm on my kids of what's right and wrong,' like, how do you do that?\"</p><p>Just before the pandemic, Dr. Kennedy was researching an idea for a product she called a \"sleep button\" that children could push to hear a parent's voice for comfort in the middle of the night. She made a prototype for her own kids that included a few bars of \"You Are My Sunshine\" and a private sleep mantra. The venture never took off, but Dr. Kennedy put her research on Instagram, and soon parents were coming in droves. (She is now considering reviving the button.)</p><p>Dr. Kennedy's Good Inside company is housed in a Manhattan office with 17 employees. She created the enterprise with a graduate school friend, Erica Belsky, whose husband, venture capitalist Scott Belsky, served as a sounding board early on. The company Red Antler, whose clients include Instagram-friendly brands like Allbirds shoes and Casper mattresses, came up with the \"Good Inside\" name.</p><p>Now comes the little toilet, which Frida calls a disrupter in the potty space. The product offers new features for child comfort and parent cleanup, as well as a step-stool that children can use to climb onto an adult toilet on their own. The company shares with Good Inside the same goal, to arm adults with tools to navigate parenthood, as well as a similar \"relevant and fresh\" visual aesthetic that eschews juvenile touches like \"Paw Patrol\" characters, said Frida chief executive Chelsea Hirschhorn.</p><p>A promotional image for the potty features a dad in white shorts—brave, given the task—who sits with his child in a spotless bathroom. Both are looking at a guide titled \"Turd's the Word.\" It is opened to the first page, where a smiling Dr. Becky is already there, waiting to greet them.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Would you consider using a parenting coach?
