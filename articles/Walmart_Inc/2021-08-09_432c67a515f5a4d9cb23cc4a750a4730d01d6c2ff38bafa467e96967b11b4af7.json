  "text": "<p>The UK takeover regulator has given Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice an extended August 20 deadline to make an offer for Wm Morrison, in the latest twist in a bidding war between two US private equity groups for control of the UK's third-largest supermarket chain. </p> <p>CD&amp;R, which had previously been given until 5pm on August 9 to make an offer or walk away, asked for more time after its rival bidder, SoftBank-owned Fortress, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b2286ee-e991-4f36-8d62-f9acbddf2721\">increased its bid to almost £10bn</a> on Friday. </p> <p>The Takeover Panel, which oversees UK mergers and acquisitions, said it granted the extension in the light of the grocer's decision to delay a shareholder meeting to vote on the Fortress offer. The new deadline would cease to apply if a third party announced a firm intention to bid, it said. </p> <p>The move indicates that an extended bidding war for the company is likely: the panel typically grants extensions to bidders only if convinced they are serious about making a higher offer. </p> <p>Private equity companies have stepped up their interest in UK-listed companies this year to take advantage of lower valuations in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic. </p> <p>CD&amp;R has asked some of its investors to put up extra funds for the Morrisons deal, said two people with knowledge of the matter. Buyout groups often include some of their larger backers such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds as “co-investors” in deals. </p> <p>Both bidders believe the regulator could eventually take the rare step of intervening to end the battle by holding an auction for Morrisons. Separately, the Takeover Panel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab7753be-8bc8-4e0d-b00e-edcae1809b18?\">announced on Monday an auction</a> for the inhaler company Vectura, which tobacco group Philip Morris International and private equity firm Carlyle are vying for control of. </p> <p>Private equity interest in Morrisons first became public in June when the grocer said it had rejected an offer from CD&amp;R. Fortress had made several approaches to the company, and agreed a £9.5bn deal with Morrisons' board in early July. </p> <p>CD&amp;R counts Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, among its advisers. Morrisons' chair Andrew Higginson previously worked alongside Leahy at Tesco. </p> <p>Fortress manages about $53.1bn in assets and is best known for its work in credit and distressed investing situations.</p> <p>CD&amp;R's offer may face antitrust scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority because the company also owns Motor Fuel Group, which operates more than 900 petrol stations.</p> <p>The competition watchdog forced the owners of MFG's rival EG Group to sell some sites when they bought Asda this year.</p><p>Source: Kaye Wiggins 2021 'Morrisons takeover battle extended as CD&amp;R given more time to bid' FT.com 9 August.
