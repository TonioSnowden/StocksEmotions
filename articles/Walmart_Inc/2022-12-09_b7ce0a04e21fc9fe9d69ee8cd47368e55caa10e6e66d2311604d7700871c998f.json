  "text": "<p>Our household has a ranking system for fiction, starting at the extreme negative: “I wish that I had all the time back this black hole of a novel sucked from my life”. At the extreme positive pole is “husband-worthy”. My spouse reads little fiction, and I only pass him the gems.</p> <p>Jonathan Dee's eighth novel (his 2011 novel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a420d62-0c64-11df-a941-00144feabdc0\"><em>The Privileges</em></a> was a Pulitzer Prize finalist) <em>Sugar Street</em> made the spousal cut. Pithy, dry, sometimes trenchant. Plenty of narrative drive. A fast read that doesn't tell us more than we need to know. Indeed, Dee tells us a great deal less than we need to know. If being cruelly stingy on a loaded back-story is a tried-and-true device, never argue with what works.</p> <p>Although we're provided a couple of aliases, one of the factoids of which we're deprived is the white, vaguely middle-aged narrator's name, which he has abandoned. Let's call him X. Driving through a region of the US he never cites, X informs us, “I have no ID at this point, neither fake nor real. I cut up my driver's license right before I hit the road. Which means I have to stay at or below the speed limit at all times, signal every turn, come to a complete stop. I'm the most law-abiding driver in America.”</p> <p>X is absconding — from the law, from his past (whatever that might be), from anyone he has ever known. He aims to become perfectly anonymous, even to himself. Accordingly, he is intent on avoiding surveillance cameras, which not only rules out the interstate highway system but chain stores such as Target and Walmart. The supreme difficulty these days of dodging the watchful eye of various Big Brothers is, of course, part of the point. X's determination not to furnish any party data constrains his choices and exiles him to the social fringe. Even accessing the internet on a library's free computer requires producing photo ID.</p> <p>X is travelling with an envelope containing $168,048 in cash. We have no idea where the dosh is from, and Dee is not going to tell us. X has done something. While it was probably bad, more than one textual clue hints that it might have been heroic. From the start we worry about that envelope, from which any loner could be easily parted, although X does plenty of worrying for us. While he's trying to check into a motel with no identification by leaving a large cash security deposit, does the whole wad come with, or can it briefly remain stashed under the driver's seat? Only the money facilitates X's quest to set up shop in an ugly, nothing city as a perfect nobody.</p> <p>X ditches his car, whose registration could locate him, and rents a shabby upstairs room in a shady part of a town from a hard, take-no-prisoners hospital shift worker in her thirties. The incongruously named Autumn is instinctively suspicious of X, who pays for six months up front. A callous, contemptuous woman and a heavy drinker, Autumn is no pushover. Luckily, X doesn't want to form a relationship with anybody. Yet, just like those security cameras, he discovers how damnably difficult connections with one's neighbours are to avoid.</p> <p>“No place to go, no place to be,” he notes once settled. “No interactions, no relationships. That's when you can feel time passing, doing its work on you. I mean actually feel it. The day tingles like stepping out of a bath. I can feel time on my skin.”</p> <p>The unnamed city has a substantial refugee population, many of them children, with whom X exhibits an unfocused liberal sympathy. “I can see from your face that you're one of those types gets a boner thinking about the plight of the poor refugee but let me tell you something,” Autumn scoffs. “Whatever these kids have gone through, it's made them worse not better. Not their fault but so what? They're nightmares.”</p> <p>The set-up is well conceived, as well as laden with our foreknowledge that X's mission to remain anonymous is doomed, that his past will catch up with him, and that this story will end badly. Although X's ambition to achieve anonymity mixes with a desire for purification, for goodness, for expiation and redemption, the text teems with the anger and misanthropic disgust that seems to fuel so many of America's white, disaffected, male mass murderers. X even expresses disdain for Jonathan Dee's undertaking: “What are books anyway, in this world? Little antiquities. A library is a sort of roadside museum.”</p> <p>Dee's style is clean, raw, terse. What's close to a novella (and I love novellas) is perfectly paced. The voice conveys a yearning for something better against a bone-deep cynicism: “I always wanted peace, and I used to imagine that made me some kind of radical. But now I get it that peace is self-serving; peace protects the status quo and those who like it.” You sure won't see the ending coming. I'm not honestly certain why this physically slight novel is as good as it is — although, as I said, never argue with what works. </p> <p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FaJZkx\"><strong>Sugar Street</strong></a> by Jonathan Dee, <em>Corsair £16.99, 224 pages/Grove Atlantic $26, 206 pages</em></p> <p><em>Lionel Shriver's most recent book is ‘Abominations: Selected Essays from a Career of Courting Self-Destruction' (Borough Press, 2022)</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Lionel Shriver 2022 'Sugar Street by Jonathan Dee — X marks the plot' FT.com 9 December.
