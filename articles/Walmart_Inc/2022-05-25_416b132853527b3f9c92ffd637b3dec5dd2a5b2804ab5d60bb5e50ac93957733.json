  "text": "<p>Ramos, a former student at Uvalde High School, shot his grandmother before going to Robb Elementary School, police said. He left his vehicle outside the elementary school in Uvalde and carried a handgun inside, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.</p><p>Two police officers who responded to the scene were shot, but are expected to survive, the governor said.</p><p>\"What happened in Uvalde is a horrific tragedy that cannot be tolerated in the state of Texas,\" said Mr. Abbott, a Republican.</p><p>At the current death toll, Tuesday's shooting in Texas was the deadliest at a U.S. school since the slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012, where 20 children and six staff members died. In 2018, an attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., left 17 students and staff dead. Historically, elementary schools haven't been the sites of mass shootings with as much frequency as high schools or middle schools.</p><p>Before Tuesday's shooting the massacre at a Buffalo supermarket on May 14 in which 10 people were killed was this year's worst mass shooting in the U.S. That record stood for a little more than a week.</p><p>The Uvalde school district reported an active shooter at Robb Elementary School just after 11:30 a.m. local time Tuesday. The school, according to the district's website, teaches second- to fourth-grade students.</p><p>All district and campus activities, after-school programs and other events were canceled. The district said parents could pick up students at regular dismissal times at their respective campuses and officers would be there to escort the students to their parents' vehicles.</p><p>\"Parents please be patient as lines will be long,\" the school district said in a post on social media.</p><p>After the shooting, Uvalde Memorial Hospital said 13 children arrived by ambulance or bus for treatment and two people arrived deceased.</p><p>University Health, in San Antonio, said it had received two patients from the shooting, a child and an adult. The hospital said the adult was a 66-year-old woman in critical condition. Hospital authorities didn't confirm whether the woman was the shooter's grandmother.</p><p>The child, identified as a 10-year-old girl, was also in critical condition.</p><p>Late Tuesday, authorities were in the process of notifying victims' families, said Pete Arredondo, Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District's chief of police.</p><p>Armando Ramos, an uncle of Salvador Ramos, said in an interview that he didn't think his nephew intended to target the school but wound up there after a police chase. Salvador Ramos's grandmother, whose name he declined to share, is currently in surgery, he said.</p><p>President Biden was briefed on the shooting as he flew back to Washington from a trip to Asia and gave remarks Tuesday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>\"His prayers are with the families impacted by this awful event,\" she tweeted.</p><p>The president ordered the flag at the White House and across federal property to be flown at half-staff until sunset Saturday.</p><p>Gov. Abbott said he had instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers to work with local law enforcement to investigate the shooting.</p><p>Some of the nation's worst mass shootings have unfolded in Texas in recent years. A 2017 mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killed 26 people.</p><p>The following year, a 17-year-old opened fire at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, killing 10 people.</p><p>In 2019, a gunman killed 23 and wounded 22 at a Walmart store in El Paso.</p><p>On Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report on active-shooter incidents in the U.S. in 2021 that showed a 50% increase from 2020. According to the FBI, 103 people were killed and 140 wounded in last year's 61 active shooting incidents, excluding the shooters.</p><p>â€”Alex Leary, Dan Frosch and Sadie Gurman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com and Elizabeth Findell at elizabeth.findell@wsj.com</p><p>Texas Shooter Kills at Least 18 Children and One Teacher in Elementary School</p>",
