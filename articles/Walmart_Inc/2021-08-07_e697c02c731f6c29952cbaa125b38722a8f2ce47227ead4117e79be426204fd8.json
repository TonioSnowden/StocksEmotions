  "text": "<p>Square wants a bigger slice of the payments industry. On Aug. 1, the company best known for its signature white card reader that plugs into phones said it has agreed to acquire the installment-payment company Afterpay Ltd. The deal illustrates how financial technology companies are seeking scale to challenge the big banks. A key attraction was a growing wariness toward traditional credit among younger consumers, a group particularly hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Square plans to add Afterpay as an option through its smaller merchants. Square shares soared 10% Monday.</p><p>MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC.</p><p>MAR -1.6%</p><p>The Delta variant is an unwelcome guest that could spell trouble for Marriott in the fall. Although cancellations have slowed from earlier in the pandemic, the hotel chain's finance chief said on Tuesday that some cancellations for group bookings later this year could be attributable to the spread of the highly transmissible strain of Covid-19. Marriott did post gains for the June quarter driven by leisure travel, and said it expects demand for business and group stays to rise in the fall. Marriott also anticipates more workers returning to offices on a hybrid basis. Marriott shares fell 1.6% Tuesday.</p><p>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC.</p><p>ATVI -3.5%</p><p>Activision Blizzard is hitting reset. The videogame publisher replaced executives while facing a gender-bias lawsuit and calls to improve its culture. Activision said Tuesday that J. Allen Brack had stepped down as president of the studio behind hit franchises such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch. The company also said a human-resources executive was no longer in his role. A California agency sued the company last month, accusing Mr. Brack and others of failing to respond to employee complaints of harassment. Activision Blizzard shares decreased 3.5% Tuesday.</p><p>LYFT INC.</p><p>LYFT -11%</p><p>Lyft got a surprising lift. The ride-share company notched its first-ever measure of profitability a quarter earlier than expected, after the pandemic initially crushed demand. Strong ride-hailing demand in the second quarter and cost cuts throughout the pandemic enabled Lyft to post its first profit on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Still, the company continues to deal with the effects of the pandemic, and the spread of the Delta variant could present renewed challenges during the rest of the year. Lyft shares dropped 11% Wednesday.</p><p>SPIRIT AIRLINES INC.</p><p>SAVE -4.1%</p><p>Spirit has a lot of angry customers on its hands. Chief Executive Ted Christie apologized for five days of flight cancellations that upended plans for thousands of people, saying the budget carrier struggled to resolve problems that spiraled out of control. The airline has canceled over 1,700 flights since Aug. 1, including more than half of its schedule for the day on Thursday, according to flight tracking firm FlightAware. Mr. Christie said this week's difficulties were the culmination of a month of delays and operational problems that snowballed. Spirit shares lost 4.1% Friday.</p><p>PEPSICO INC.</p><p>PEP +0.2%</p><p>Tropicana is getting squeezed out of PepsiCo's drink lineup. The beverage giant said Tuesday it would sell the orange-juice maker and other brands to private-equity firm PAI Partners. PepsiCo joins Nestle SA and Coca-Cola Co. in shedding well-known but less profitable brands to refocus on products that appeal to changing consumer tastes. Consumption of fruit juices and sugary sodas is down, while demand is up for beverages that help people stay awake or offer health benefits. PepsiCo shares added 0.2% Tuesday.</p><p>UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS INC.</p><p>UAL +0.8%</p><p>Vaccine mandates are coming to corporate America. United Airlines will require its 67,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated this fall, as the Delta variant drives an increase in Covid-19 infections. Walmart Inc. and Microsoft Corp. imposed vaccine mandates mostly on white-collar workers returning to offices, and Tyson Foods Inc. will require all workers to get the vaccine by Nov. 1. United Airlines shares rose 0.8% Friday.</p>",
