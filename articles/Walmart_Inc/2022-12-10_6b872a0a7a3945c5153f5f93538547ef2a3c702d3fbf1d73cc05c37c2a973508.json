  "title": "U.S. News:  Walmart Probed Complaints About Shooter  ----  By Sarah Nassauer",
  "text": "<p>   More than two years before a Walmart supervisor shot and killed six workers, Walmart Inc. executives investigated employee workplace complaints against him, according to former and current employees. </p><p>   Last month, Andre Bing killed six co-workers and left four others injured before fatally shooting himself at the Chesapeake, Va., store where he worked, police say. The 31-year-old had worked at Walmart since 2010 and was the overnight shift manager. A number of the victims were shot in the store's break room. </p><p>   Walmart's handling of Bing and what it knew about problems at the store have been raised in two lawsuits brought against the company by employees who survived the attack. Both suits allege Bing demonstrated a pattern of disturbing workplace behavior. A Walmart spokesman said the company is reviewing both complaints and will respond with the court. </p><p>   In early 2020, Walmart regional managers interviewed members of the store's overnight shift about Bing after several complaints that he was an unkind manager and engaged in threatening behavior, according to the former and current employees familiar with the investigation. </p><p>   \"We were individually interviewed,\" said Amanda Land, a former employee at the Chesapeake store. Bing \"was not easy to get along with,\" said Ms. Land, who left the store in 2020. \"He thought people were always talking crap about him,\" she said. </p><p>   It couldn't be learned which steps Walmart took after the investigation. A spokesman for Walmart declined to comment. Family members for Bing couldn't be reached. </p><p>   Separately, people who had worked with Bing said in recent interviews that he could be combative and difficult to work with. They said he would cover his cellphone camera with tape because he said he worried the government was tracking him. </p><p>   \"Andre did a lot of weird things,\" said Nathan Sinclair, who worked at the Chesapeake Walmart until recently, during an interview soon after the shooting. \"Andre was an aggressive person.\" </p><p>   Bing bought a 9mm handgun the morning of the attack and left behind a note alleging he was harassed and ridiculed by co-workers, according to police. In it, he wrote, \"I was harassed by idiots with low intelligence and a lack of wisdom.\" </p><p>   The lawsuits were filed in Chesapeake Circuit Court in the aftermath of the attack by two store workers who survived the shooting, claiming that they had complained to Walmart managers about harassing behavior by Bing months before the incident. </p><p></p>",
