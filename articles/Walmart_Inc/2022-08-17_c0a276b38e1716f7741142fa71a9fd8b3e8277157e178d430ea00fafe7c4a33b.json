  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fb6f361-a7bb-4b98-8100-6847b5df79b4\">UK inflation</a> has hit double digits for the first time in more than 40 years, raising the possibility of interest rates rising further and faster, and coming hot on the heels of labour market data showing real levels of wages falling rapidly.</p> <p>The leap in July's CPI to 10.1 per cent, the highest in the G7, was up from 9.4 per cent in June and fuelled by a 12.7 per cent&#xa0;increase in food prices, the biggest increase in more than 20 years. Excluding volatile food and energy, the core rate was also more than expected, hitting 6.2 per cent.</p> <p>Short-term <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4117ce75-c7ec-491f-86e3-84f25e039323\">UK government bonds</a> sold off sharply on the news as traders lifted their expectations for Bank of England rate rises to more than two percentage points by May next year. </p> <p>Economics editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1559808099531251712\">Chris Giles</a> argues the BoE needs to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bb08941-a091-446b-a048-c6a981af8bea\">acknowledge the mistakes</a> in its approach to containing inflation and that Boris Johnson's replacement as prime minister should look afresh at its mandate. (You can read what the two Tory contenders think about the economy and other key issues in our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9354505-a692-4640-aec1-1e38c5d2f14d\">explainer</a>). </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c233c60e-7d88-465a-9b8b-c35b6a5ca339\">Giles points out</a>, BoE policymakers are keen to highlight what they see as the benefits of an independent central bank controlling inflation. One even deployed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haskelecon/status/1559580484211916800\">data going back some 800 years</a> (!) to make his point. </p> <p>Today's news follows yesterday's report that real levels of UK wages fell at the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28f2b344-e2a6-4e10-bf4a-c924660eded0\"> fastest rate for at least 20 years</a> in the second quarter, highlighting the difficulties facing households even before <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e220c77a-9644-4147-bca8-7f5459bb1f50\">energy bills</a> rise sharply in October. </p> <p>Separate <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/cpihconsistentinflationrateestimatesforukhouseholdgroupsapriltojune2022\">ONS analysis</a> showed poorer households were facing greater rates of inflation because they spend a bigger proportion of their budgets on energy and food, the two fastest rising components. </p> <p>Economists said the hit to households would feed through to lower economic growth. Jamie O'Halloran at Pro Bono Economics, an organisation that advises the charitable sector, said the rapid rise in prices was “driving a punishing cost of living crisis, with the threat of recession looming ever nearer”.</p> <p><em>Compare trends across the globe with our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\"><em>global inflation tracker</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Germany's Uniper, Europe's biggest importer of Russian gas, on ‘<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2805e7eb-9cef-4756-bd5c-e4f71b699b92\">brink of insolvency</a>'</p></li>  <li><p>Egypt's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c546074b-6115-4a4d-bc58-6b7c3fbfc532\">central bank governor</a> resigns</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08be8ddf-4841-4cfb-bcb5-a5b6e820dff4#post-e1c00717-5d52-465e-b752-141aa0253706\">US retail sales</a> hold steady in July as spending on petrol drops </p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08be8ddf-4841-4cfb-bcb5-a5b6e820dff4\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>A further rise in <strong>natural gas prices</strong> in Europe and the US threatens to tip some of the world's biggest economies into recession.

Denmark's Vestas, the world's largest maker of wind turbines, and Ørsted, the world's biggest offshore wind farm developer, said governments needed to simplify their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d502c7-c1f7-4b07-9ad6-67f110507cad\">planning processes</a>. </p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p><strong>Kenyan</strong> presidential contender Raila Odinga is challenging the narrow victory of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1abc9fbe-8395-4ac4-8a85-65426a51223d\">William Ruto</a> in the election to succeed Uhuru Kenyatta. The uncertainty has sparked fears of a return of the deadly post-election violence of 2007 and 2017.</p> <p>Former Salomon Brothers economist Henry Kaufman — Wall Street's original <strong>Dr Doom</strong> — says the US Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47d407c1-2353-4068-90a7-27a9f901f051\">needs to “toughen up</a>” its fight against inflation. “If you want to change someone's action, you can't slap them on the hand, you have to hit them in the face,” he argues.</p> <p>Markets editor Katie Martin discusses the impact on investors as central banks move from quantitative easing to <strong>quantitative tightening</strong> in their struggle to contain inflation in the new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/848b9a3d-0d24-4fd6-b1a4-9202c23b6142\">Behind the Money</a> podcast.</p> <p><em>Are we heading towards a global recession?

The Lex column says the problems could push China back towards coal and an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e61b8df8-0a12-46d6-be10-f6a20ceac6d0\">increase in carbon emissions</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tencent</strong>, China's most valuable company, reported its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5ccc093-1bf6-4503-a7f6-1729fbc04c99\">first ever fall in quarterly profit</a>. The tech business is also being affected by changing consumer behaviour: “The international games market is experiencing a post-pandemic digestion period as players resume offline activities,” it said.</p> <p><strong>Walmart</strong>, the world's biggest retailer, and DIY chain <strong>Home Depot</strong> both reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/331a22d4-022e-4639-8ba8-354a6a23c038\">better than expected results</a>, lessening fears of a looming US recession. Walmart shrugged off recent profit warnings while Home Depot reported its highest quarterly sales and earnings on record.

A London restaurateur said his wage bill had increased almost 20 per cent in the past year in attempts to attract staff. “The growth in hospitality in the last 30 years has been fuelled almost entirely by a non-British workforce,” he said.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Apple chief <strong>Tim Cook</strong> has told his staff to return to the office three days a week from September to preserve the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8080070-4c41-4193-8382-4f5c8e9c5097\">in-person collaboration that is so essential to our culture</a>”.</p> <p><strong>August</strong> is the traditional time for making yourself scarce at the office.
