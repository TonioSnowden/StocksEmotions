  "text": "<p>With Trump suggesting he will declare a 2024 candidacy, he is 10 points ahead of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the latest PredictIt showing. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is also a potential GOP contender, is far behind both men, with only a 5% chance of winning the party's presidential nomination. Pence spoke Tuesday morning in Washington to the National Conservative Student Conference, blasting \"big tech, big media, big government [and] even big business\" for advancing what he called a \"pernicious woke agenda.\"</p><p>On a week featuring both a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision and important data on the U.S. economy, Trump is scheduled to speak at the America First Agenda Summit, a program of the America First Policy Institute. That non-profit organization is headed by Brooke Rollins, who ran the Domestic Policy Council in the Trump White House. Former National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is vice-chair of the institute's board.</p><p>Trump has openly flirted with, but not declared, a 2024 campaign. Doing so would subject him to campaign-finance requirements. Trump's odds of winning the GOP nomination are currently at 44%, while the odds for DeSantis sit at 34%, according to PredictIt.</p><p>That's a reversal from a bit more than a month ago, when DeSantis's odds outstripped the former president's.</p><p>Read: Betting markets favor DeSantis over Trump for 2024 Republican presidential nomination, as Elon Musk voices support for Florida governor</p><p>The former president is scheduled to speak on Tuesday afternoon.
