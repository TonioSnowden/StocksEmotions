  "text": "<p>Mr. Cornell surprised some investors on Tuesday when he said the retailer would report lower profits this quarter because it will move to quickly shed excess inventory due to shifting buying patterns. The news came less than three weeks after Target reported lower-than-expected profits, in part due to the cost of managing bloated inventory. Now the company will quickly cancel orders or sell products at a discount during the current quarter, eating further into profits, Mr. Cornell said.</p><p>Other retailers with too much inventory on hand -- including Walmart Inc., Macy's Inc. and Gap Inc. -- have said they would discount some items and hold on to others to sell at a seasonally appropriate moment. \"We have to be decisive and get out in front of this to make sure this doesn't linger through the back half of the year,\" Mr. Cornell said.</p><p>During its annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, Target executives were asked why the company cut profit forecasts so quickly after its earnings announcement.</p><p>\"While we've continued to see strong traffic and sales growth since we reported our first-quarter results we've watched as many competitors have reported elevated inventory levels,\" said Michael Fiddelke, Target's chief financial officer. \"As such we announced yesterday that we are taking a number of actions to further right-size our inventory.\"</p><p>Target shares rose slightly on Wednesday to close at $156.70.</p><p>When Mr. Cornell joined Target, the retailer had struggled with a long streak of weak sales, in part due to a data breach that eroded trust with some shoppers.</p><p>Mr. Cornell scrapped an international expansion that had already cost it $4 billion. Target, he said, would narrow its focus on the U.S., where it would concentrate on a handful of categories such as baby, fashion and e-commerce. Sales improved in some quarters, though overall the chain still lagged behind some peers. Among the problems, Mr. Cornell determined: Prices were too high, and stores needed remodels.</p><p>So in February 2017, on the day Target announced weak holiday sales, Mr. Cornell outlined a comeback plan for the U.S. business. Target, he said, would spend billions of dollars to refurbish stores, use stores as e-commerce hubs, introduce better store brands and cut prices.</p><p>The plan largely worked, then got a big boost from Covid-19. Comparable sales, those from stores or digital channels operating for at least 12 months, have increased each year since. Shoppers flocked to new services Target began offering, to buy online and pick up in store parking lots or receive home delivery.</p><p>Now Mr. Cornell is facing a new high-wire act as consumer trends shift again. \"We've had some additional time after earnings to really evaluate the overall operating environment,\" he said earlier this week. He said that includes watching consumers' behavior as theyface high rates of inflation, and seeing many other retailers talk about high inventory levels.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
