  "text": "<p>The filing comes as Instacart's growth slows following a pandemic-fueled boom, when people turned to the company's app to order groceries online rather than going to physical stores. The company raised more than $265 million in March 2021 from investors at a $39 billion valuation. It became the biggest grocery delivery company, counting supermarkets Kroger Co. and Walmart Inc. as customers. Instacart also began delivering from nonfood retailers like Best Buy Co. and expanded its advertising business to boost sales and offset costs associated with delivery.</p><p>In 2021, Instacart named Fidji Simo, a longtime executive at Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., as chief executive. Apoorva Mehta, co-founder and former CEO of Instacart, became executive chairman, saying at the time that Ms. Simo would help take the company public and expand its business.</p><p>Mr. Mehta and Ms. Simo last year also discussed possible deals with competitors DoorDash Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., people familiar with the matter previously said.</p><p>Instacart's business has grown turbulent, as competition increases and consumer habits shift. Instacart's sales grew by 330% from 2019 to 2020, according to 1010data Services LLC, but increased 15% in 2021.</p>",
