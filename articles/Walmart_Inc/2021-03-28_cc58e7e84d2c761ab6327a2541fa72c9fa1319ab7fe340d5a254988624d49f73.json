  "text": "<p>Tipping is a touchy subject in the US. For some, it is a social obligation and a way to ensure good service. For others, it is a relic of the discriminatory Jim Crow era. For workers who are expected to bring their wages up to a legal minimum with tips, they simply help make ends meet.</p> <p>Who to tip, how much to tip and whether to tip at all have become thorny questions since the pandemic closed restaurants and fuelled food deliveries. Surprisingly large sums are involved. One study reckons tips in the US food industry alone are worth <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.2.215\">$47bn a year</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>DoorDash drivers highlighted <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-doordash-exclusive/exclusive-low-tips-long-waits-doordash-takes-on-drivers-walmart-gripes-idUSKBN2BE175\">the issue</a> this week, complaining of low tips or none at all when making deliveries to Walmart customers. Groups such as DoorDash, Postmates, Seamless, Shipt and Instacart are among those benefiting from the food delivery boom.</p> <p>Americans who are accustomed to tacking on an extra 20 per cent for their restaurant server are less free-handed towards delivery workers who bring them meals and groceries.</p> <p>Payment technology has added to tipping fatigue. Credit card readers such as Square confront customers with an ever-expanding cast of workers to tip. The devices have been blamed for tip inflation by recommending tip amounts. A 15 per cent gratuity was once considered standard. It is now common for customers to be asked to tip 25-30 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>It makes for awkward encounters between customers and workers. To what extent should one be obliged to give workers something extra simply for doing their jobs? Postal workers get no tips. Why should delivery drivers?&#xa0;</p> <p>US labour laws are the problem. America is probably the only G8 country that allows businesses to offload the burden of paying workers a minimum wage on to customers. <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped\">In New Jersey</a>, for example, employers only have to pay tipped workers $4.13 an hour if tips bring total earnings up to the minimum wage of $12 an hour.</p> <p>In a national crisis, gig delivery workers should be rewarded for putting their health at risk. But that reward should come on top of a living wage — not be the source of it. </p> <p>The link between tips and good service is weak. Japan has no tipping culture but excels at service. It is time for the US to phase out subminimum wages for tipped workers.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
