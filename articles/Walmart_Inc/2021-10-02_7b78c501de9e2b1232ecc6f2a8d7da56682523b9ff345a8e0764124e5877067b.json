  "text": "<p>US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice has triumphed in the four-month long takeover battle for Wm Morrison with a bid of £9.97bn including debt for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket.</p> <p>The fate of the grocer, which was founded in 1899 and has been a quoted company since 1967, was sealed in an auction process on Saturday, supervised by the UK's takeover regulator.</p> <p>The winning bid of 287p a share was 2p a share above CD&amp;R's existing offer and just a penny above the 286p offered by a consortium led by SoftBank-owned Fortress Investment. Its bid represented an enterprise value of £9.95bn. </p> <p>Joshua Pack, managing partner at Fortress, said Morrisons was “an outstanding business” and wished it and its new owners “the very best for the future”.</p> <p>He added that the UK “remains a very attractive investment environment from many perspectives” and pledged to continue exploring opportunities there.</p> <p>CD&amp;R is paying a 61 per cent premium to the price of Morrisons' shares before the saga began, while the total transaction value is 11.8 times the group's underlying profit for the year to January 2021, before adjusting for the reimbursement of a government business rates holiday. </p> <p>The grocer's board met on Saturday afternoon and unanimously recommended the revised offer. Chair Andrew Higginson said it “represents excellent value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders”.</p> <p>Sir Terry Leahy, the former Tesco chief executive who is now a senior adviser to CD&amp;R, said the firm was “gratified by the recommendation” and looked forward to the shareholder vote to approve the deal. </p> <p>“We continue to believe that Morrisons is an excellent business, with a strong management team, a clear strategy, and good prospects.”</p> <p>The shareholder meeting will take place on October 19. At least three-quarters of those voting must approve the transaction in order for it to proceed. </p> <p>The battle for Morrisons started behind the scenes in the spring and became public in early June, when the company confirmed that it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0abdbc0d-051e-4b75-bb41-194ef2ef25d5\">rejected a 230p a share</a> approach from CD&amp;R. </p> <p>For much of the summer, Fortress appeared to have the upper hand, securing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd0219a-6acb-4e17-be9f-69c54c85e330\">board recommendation</a> for a 254p a share bid and then <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b2286ee-e991-4f36-8d62-f9acbddf2721\">increasing it to 270p</a> in order to head off a counterbid.</p> <p>But CD&amp;R struck back in August, tabling a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c55630f-9a8e-447c-8b8f-dabb11c72983\">higher-than-expected</a> 285p a share offer and persuading the group's directors to switch their recommendation. It also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83f7114a-9434-421a-bc4c-a6e71d81488b\">reached an agreement</a> to strengthen the group's two defined-benefit pension schemes by transferring additional property into them. </p> <p>The Takeover Panel then stepped in, reaching agreement among all the parties to conclude the bidding war <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b9e0c92-76cf-4c85-b097-afb48698b9df\">using an auction process</a> conducted over up to five rounds on a single day.</p> <p>Shares closed at 296p on Friday, suggesting investors expected the bidding to go higher than it did. Independent retail commentator Nick Bubb described the auction as “a bit of a damp squib”.</p> <p>CD&amp;R has pledged to retain the group's existing management team — many of whom worked with Leahy at Tesco — and uphold the legacy of Sir Ken Morrison, the son of the group's founder who transformed it into a national player. </p> <p>“We remain confident that CD&amp;R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of an important British grocery business,” said Higginson.</p> <p>But given how high the bidding has gone, analysts believe either bidder will have to make <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/938db064-119e-42d1-af7a-1d542c72b668\">significant asset disposals</a> and cost savings in order to generate a reasonable return on their investment. </p> <p>The transaction, which if approved will complete towards the end of October, caps a period of remarkable upheaval in the UK's highly competitive supermarket sector.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a global pandemic that has tested their operational capabilities to the limit, two of the four biggest grocers with a quarter of the market between them, will have changed hands.</p> <p>In February Asda, the third-biggest supermarket, was sold to a consortium of TDR Capital and the Blackburn-based Issa brothers. </p> <p>The Morrisons marathon will generate a bonanza for investment banks, lawyers and public relations advisers in the City; according to the scheme documents from both sides, Morrisons will spend about £56m on financial and legal advice, while CD&amp;R's bill is expected to reach about £63m. Fortress expects to spend £53m.</p> <p>CD&amp;R will now spend millions more arranging a multibillion-pound debt package to help finance the takeover.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'CD&amp;R triumphs in £10bn Morrisons battle' FT.com 2 October.
