  "title": "Lululemon, Abercrombie Warn of Omicron Impact on Holiday Sales; Retailers say fourth-quarter sales won't be as strong as expected, citing reduced staffing or inventory shortages",
  "text": "<p>Lululemon said it is expecting results for the quarter to come in toward the lower end of its forecasts. In early December, Lululemon said it was expecting revenue of $2.13 billion to $2.17 billion over the three-month stretch, with adjusted per-share earnings of $3.25 to $3.32.</p><p>Abercrombie now predicts that net sales in the January-ended quarter will be flat to down 2% compared with 2019 levels. Previously, it had forecast that net sales would be up 3% to 5% on a two-year comparison.</p><p>\"We did not have enough inventory to keep pace with customer demand, resulting in lost sales during the peak holiday selling period,\" CEO Fran Horowitz said.</p><p>Some big retail chains like Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were able to sidestep many supply-chain problems by importing goods early in 2021 or by chartering their own vessels to get around port backlogs. But Gap Inc. and other smaller chains warned they might not have enough items in stores for the holidays.</p><p>The Omicron wave has sent Covid-19 cases to unprecedented levels in the U.S., leaving companies scrambling to maintain their operations as the virus disrupts the lives of staff and customers.</p><p>Discount chain Big Lots Inc. also cut its fourth-quarter financial projections on Monday, citing a sales slowdown since early January that it attributed to the weather and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.</p><p>Some forecasters have expressed concern that Omicron could exacerbate tightness in supply chains and labor markets already stretched thin by pandemic conditions. Monthly employment data released Friday suggested that companies have been competing for a limited pool of workers, with wages growing 4.7% year over year last month.</p><p>Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month shortened the time that people are asked to stay isolated after contracting Covid-19, opening the door for people to return to work faster after an infection.</p><p>Lululemon posted solid sales growth in each of the fiscal year's first three quarters, with revenue leaping by double digits year over year in each three-month span. Fourth-quarter sales of $2.13 billion, at the low end of Lululemon's forecast, would still mark roughly 23% growth over 12 months.</p><p>Since early 2020, Vancouver, British Columbia-based Lululemon has won out from the decline of in-person work as shoppers traded khakis and dresses for sweatpants and T-shirts. As with other retailers, Lululemon also benefited from a surge in online ordering.</p><p>Omicron's recent drag on Lululemon adds to evidence that the latest Covid-19 wave is once again denting in-person sales for retailers across the board.</p><p>\"I think Lululemon is one of the best-in-class operators, a brand that's had tremendous momentum,\" Stifel analyst Jim Duffy said. \"If Omicron is impacting them, it's certainly impacting others.\"</p><p>Shares of Lululemon fell about 2% on Monday, recouping some of the losses from earlier in the day. Abercrombie and Big Lots issued their updates after markets closed. Abercrombie shares rose about 6% in after hours trading, while Big Lots fell about 7%.</p><p>Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Lululemon, Abercrombie Warn of Omicron Impact on Holiday Sales</p>",
