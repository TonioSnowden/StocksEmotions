  "text": "<p>Wm Morrison hinted at improved cash returns to investors after reporting a “good start” to its financial year. </p> <p>The UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain pledged to “refresh” its long-term capital allocation plans at interim results in September and said the financial year ending 2023 should be “another year of meaningful profit growth”.</p> <p>In a first-quarter trading update, Morrison said it was increasingly confident of meeting guidance set out in March. It reported “encouraging signs both of significantly lower direct Covid-19 costs and of the recovery of profit lost due to the pandemic in areas such as fuel and food-to-go”.</p> <p>Same-store sales for the 14 weeks to May 9 were up 2.7 per cent versus the same period last year, Morrison reported. Including fuel, sales of which fell sharply during the first lockdown, sales were up 4.7 per cent.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>THG</strong>, the UK ecommerce and technology company, said it raised $320m with an overnight share placing at 596p, equal to the previous day's close, having initially targeted $270m. The Manchester-based company, formerly known as The Hut Group, said after the close on Monday that it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d8962cf-6ea9-49c0-8c0f-9abae4afa59a\">struck a deal with SoftBank</a> of Japan to accelerate its expansion. Masayoshi Son's investment group will buy a stake of about 10 per cent in THG for $730m.</p> <p><strong>Amigo</strong>&#xa0;said the vast majority of customers have voted in favour of its plan to pay reduced compensation. The guarantor lender, which has warned it cannot afford to meet compensation costs in full, said votes in favour of its settlement represented 95.1 per cent of the total cast. The Financial Conduct Authority on Monday wrote to Amigo to say it would oppose in court the group's attempt to wind up operations via a Scheme of Arrangement, even if approved by a majority of creditors. The FCA contests that creditors' claims being significantly reduced while other stakeholders such as shareholders are not being asked to contribute.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>FirstGroup</strong> said it has reached agreement with the Department for Transport on the termination fee payable for the Transpennine Express following last year's emergency nationalisation of train franchises. The DfT will pay FirstGroup an additional £6m over and above the £42.5m already paid into the operating company, it said. The DfT has extended emergency measures until September following its conclusion that Transpennine Express would have remained solvent had the pandemic not occurred, FirstGroup added. The decision allows FirstGroup to release an £80m provision held in reserve.</p> <p><strong>City Pub Group</strong> said trading since outdoor reopening has been encouraging, with the 24 pubs currently open and trading at 77 per cent of 2019 levels. The acquisitive company set a long-term target of more than doubling its estate to 100 pubs. Its full-year results showed revenue down 57 per cent to £25.8m resulting in a pre-tax loss of £6.5m from a £1.3m profit the year before. </p> <p>Sector peer <strong>Revolution Bars</strong> said its sites able to open have been trading “extremely strongly” in spite of “the often unseasonably cold weather”. Venues able to partially open have delivered 48 per cent of 2019 level sales in the four weeks to May 9, it said. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p>Outsourcer <strong>Capita</strong> said it had poached Tim Weller, G4S's chief financial officer. Weller will become Capita's CFO from Wednesday having held the same position at G4S since 2016. Gordon Boyd, Capita's interim CFO, will step down on the same date as planned, the company said.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile</h2> <p><strong>Amazon</strong> set a record in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83107255-d3f2-416b-aba9-37a8cadb0296\">the corporate bond market</a> on Monday. The ecommerce group raised $18.5bn of debt across bonds of eight different maturities, ranging from two to 40 years and paying a similar interest rate on some to the US government. On its $1bn two-year bond, it paid just 0.1 percentage points more than the yield on equivalent US Treasury debt, a record according to data from Refinitiv. Today also sees the launch of a new series <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ab41b9e-a294-430f-951d-49cfc3415460\">on the future of retail</a>, starting with the Amazon versus Walmart battle for control of America's $1.3tn grocery market. </p> <p>The FBI on Monday identified <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0afb53f0-f382-442a-9a32-02824ce8bb70\">DarkSide</a>, an organisation believed to be run from Russia by an experienced team of online criminals, as being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea2afceb-3770-414e-a14e-1238675fe63a\">“responsible”</a> for compromising <strong>the Colonial pipeline network</strong> that was the subject of a cyber attack on Friday and shut down. The Colonial Pipeline Company, which is backed by a group of investors including private equity group KKR and the Koch Industries conglomerate, said it would restore most service by the end of the week.</p> <p><strong>Vice Media</strong>, the youth-focused news and entertainment group, has launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/942bf107-3824-4611-b0f7-b4816d4ee2a5\">a free-to-watch online television channel</a> to capitalise on the boom in streaming as it prepares for a stock market listing. Under chief executive Nancy Dubuc, the former chief executive of A&amp;E Networks who took over from founder Shane Smith in 2018, Vice has been revisiting its business model while aiming to keep its reputation for edgy content and sway with millennials. </p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>The byzantine approach we take to rewarding top executives often means wailing about payment for failure. It turns out the system <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/207622c5-7df7-453a-9fcf-e6d1538b70f1\">can't really cope with paying for success either</a>. AstraZeneca is&#xa0;facing a revolt&#xa0;at its shareholder meeting today over the pay for Pascal Soriot, its talented chief executive whose performance in the job actually lives up to the multimillion-pound billing.</p> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>Only once government measures such as the furlough scheme end will it become clear whether provisions made for losses at Provident's remaining divisions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95a23a4e-1bb2-46d3-ac8b-412ae90b641b\">are high enough</a>.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Wm Morrison hints at cash return for shareholders after a ‘good start' to the year' FT.com 11 May.
