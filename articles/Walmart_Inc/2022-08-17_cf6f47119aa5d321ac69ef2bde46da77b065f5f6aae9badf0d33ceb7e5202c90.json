  "text": "<p>\"I'm Glad My Mom Died,\" a new memoir by former Nickelodeon star Jennette McCurdy, had all the makings of a publishing hit: a provocative title, an eye-catching cover, organic online buzz and glossy profiles that centered on the author's troubled childhood and Hollywood secrets. But no one was fully prepared for the response the book received.</p><p>Within a day of its Aug. 9 release, \"I'm Glad My Mom Died\" sold out at major retailers including Amazon, Target, Walmart and Barnes &amp; Noble, as well as most independent bookstores. At the store Books Are Magic in Brooklyn, which hosted a 300-person event with Ms. McCurdy on the book's publication day, 400 copies sold out in under 24 hours. Emma Straub, the store's owner, said she hadn't seen that happen since the September 2021 release of Sally Rooney's \"Beautiful World, Where Are You.\"</p><p>\"We felt confident the book would be a bestseller based on the enthusiastic response of early readers and reviewers, strong pre-order numbers and significant media interest, and the book was well positioned to succeed in the marketplace,\" a Simon &amp; Schuster spokesperson wrote in an email. \"But demand on the order of what we are currently experiencing with 'I'm Glad My Mom Died' is a rare and unpredictable phenomenon.\"</p><p>The book's success can be chalked up, in part, to the author's enduring fan base. Though no longer acting, Ms. McCurdy, 30, is known for her days on the Nickelodeon series \"iCarly\" and the spinoff \"Sam &amp; Cat,\" in which she starred opposite Ariana Grande. In the memoir, she describes a life and career tightly controlled by her mother, Debra McCurdy, who died in 2013 after a long battle with cancer. Per Simon &amp; Schuster, sales from the first week totaled 200,000 across all formats, including audiobooks and orders awaiting fulfillment. Her book is currently No. 3 on Amazon's best-seller list. (Ms. McCurdy, who previously contributed essays to The Wall Street Journal, was not available for comment.)</p><p>Kristina Rivero, a bookseller on the Books Are Magic events team, said she flagged the title as one to watch, even though Simon &amp; Schuster had not done much to promote it to the store. \"They didn't actually send us the book by default,\" Ms. Rivero said. \"I had reached out multiple times requesting a copy of it in advance.\" (A Simon &amp; Schuster spokesperson said \"galleys were proactively shared with booksellers,\" and some influencers received gift boxes including the book and a yellow tote bag with the phrase \"I'm Glad\" on it.)</p><p>Many publishers have been forced to adjust their print allotments to contend with supply-chain issues and an ongoing paper shortage. Per Simon &amp; Schuster, the initial print run of Ms. McCurdy's book was 70,000, and demand for the title has outpaced production enough that the publisher \"went back to press even before the book came out.\" Soon, there will be over 330,000 copies in print. The second printing will be \"coming off-press at the end of the week,\" according to the publisher, and distributed across several retail channels.</p><p>Excitement around the book has spawned a secondary market of sorts. On eBay, sellers are listing first-edition hardcovers and signed copies, some for close to $200 a piece.</p><p>When Lexi Carey, 24, found a listing for the book on Amazon for just $12, she ordered it immediately. \"I was like, 'Maybe it's just really cheap,'\" she said. (The list price for \"I'm Glad My Mom Died\" is $27.99.)</p><p>The listing, on closer inspection, contained several negative reviews from disgruntled customers who said they had not received a copy of the hardcover book but rather a paperback that appeared nearly identical to \"I'm Glad My Mom Died.\" Except on its cover was the word \"NOTEBOOK\" in black block lettering, and inside the pages were blank and lined. It wasn't long before Ms. Carey received her own notebook in the mail.</p><p>Mary Rasenberger, the CEO of the Authors Guild, a professional organization that helps authors protect their copyrights, said in a written statement that the guild has seen \"every possible scam and infringement of books on the Amazon platform\" in recent years, including \"outright counterfeits, cutting and pasting from other books to create a 'new' one and republishing other people's books with a new cover.\" The Authors Guild has been working with Amazon to curb these practices since 2018.</p><p>Julia Lee, an Amazon spokeswoman, confirmed that the \"I'm Glad My Mom Died\" notebook is no longer for sale and wrote in an email that the e-commerce platform has \"taken appropriate action on the publisher account.\" Customers who purchased the notebook may receive a refund, she noted, adding that, \"All publishers are required to follow our content guidelines and the terms and conditions of our service.\"</p><p>Ms. McCurdy's breakout success echoes recent testimony in the ongoing antitrust lawsuit between the Department of Justice and Penguin Random House, which last year announced a $2.18 billion bid to acquire Simon &amp; Schuster. The defense has stated that the Justice Department's argument—that the merger will limit competition—belies the realities of the book publishing business, where best-sellers are not always predictable.</p><p>The Simon &amp; Schuster spokesperson wrote that the publisher has been \"delighted and amazed by the incredible response to 'I'm Glad My Mom Died.'\" Ms. Straub of Books Are Magic described it as an anomaly in its genre.</p><p>\"There are a lot of books written and published by celebrities. Most of those books are garbage. Most of those books are fluffy, glossy puddles of nothing,\" she said. \"When one comes along that is honest and truly revealing and written by that person—and that person has a devoted audience who knows to trust them—it's a totally different experience.\"</p><p>No One Was Ready for Jennette McCurdy's Memoir</p>",
