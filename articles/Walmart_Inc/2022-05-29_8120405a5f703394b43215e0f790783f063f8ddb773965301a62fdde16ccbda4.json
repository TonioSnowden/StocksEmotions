  "title": "Workers' Share of Economic Pie Isn't Growing; Wages are up but so are prices and profits, so labor's share of economic income is flat",
  "text": "<p>In the first quarter of the year, wages and benefits made up 62.9% of national income (which is roughly equivalent to gross domestic product adjusted for depreciation), not far from the 62.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic became widespread in the U.S., according to the Commerce Department.</p><p>The labor share spiked in the first half of 2020, when pandemic lockdowns tipped the economy into recession and business income fell faster than payrolls. But it dropped back in the second half of the year as the economic recovery took hold.</p><p>There are two likely explanations for the failure of the labor share to rise. First, wage increases in the tight labor market largely went to people switching jobs, who represent a relatively small share of the workforce in any given month.</p><p>Job switchers saw a median wage increase of 7.2% in April, whereas those who stayed at their jobs saw a 5.3% median wage increase, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p><p>Second, strong consumer demand gave firms the power to raise prices and collect higher revenues.</p><p>Businesses also benefited early in the pandemic from the $1 trillion Paycheck Protection Program, which consisted of forgivable loans to businesses to discourage them from laying off workers. As those loans are forgiven, they are counted as profits.</p><p>Those gains on the revenue side of the ledger more than offset the wage increases on the cost side of the ledger. In other words, as workers, Americans benefited from tight labor markets, which pushed average hourly wages 5.5% up in April from a year earlier. But as consumers, they have lost out as inflation reached 8.3% in April.</p><p>\"We've seen some nominal wages pick up but not as fast as inflation, which says to me that workers are just not quite as able to demand the full amount of wage increases to keep them harmless,\" said Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.</p><p>Many economists and Federal Reserve officials worry that rising wages could keep up the pressure on inflation. Officials at the Fed's May meeting said \"their business contacts had continued to report that substantial increases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers,\" according to minutes of the meeting released May 25.</p><p>But some economists point to the labor share to argue that there is little risk that higher wages will feed into higher inflation, a phenomenon known as a \"wage-price\" spiral.</p><p>\"There's growth, there's a strong labor market, there are wage pressures but it's just not on a broad level an acute type of power shift into labor and into a price-wage spiral,\" said Wenzhe Zhao, director of global economies and strategy at Credit Suisse.</p><p>Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC, a research firm, wrote in a report, \"It is not quite right to characterize this as an overheating labor market but rather one where labor is holding its own.\"</p><p>In principle, the share of an economy's income that goes to worker compensation and the share that goes to capital in the form of profits and interest on business debt should not vary much because relying too much on one or the other would be inefficient.</p><p>Over the last two decades, however, the share of U.S. income that goes to labor has fallen, despite periods of low unemployment.</p><p>Some economists see signs that the labor share might start to tick up in the months ahead if wage pressures continue to mount. Companies such as Target and Walmart have also reported that rising costs are eating into profits.</p><p>On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has kicked off an aggressive plan to raise interest rates to cool the labor market and bring down inflation, which could hold down wage increases.</p><p>\"We probably will see the labor share increase a bit, but if it doesn't increase now I don't know when it's going to increase,\" said Aaron Sojourner, an economist at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com</p><p>Workers' Share of Economic Pie Isn't Growing</p>",
