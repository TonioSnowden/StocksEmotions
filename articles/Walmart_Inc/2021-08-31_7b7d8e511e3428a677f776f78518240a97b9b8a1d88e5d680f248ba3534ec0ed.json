  "title": "Koch VC Arm Leads $85 Million Round in Self-Driving Truck Startup; The venture unit of the Koch Industries conglomerate is betting that automation in the transport of goods will be broadly taken up across the economy",
  "text": "<p>Gatik charges businesses a fee to set up a fixed route for its self-driving rigged box trucks to run, then charges the companies a fee for the service. Its trucks are made in partnerships with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. These manufacturers make products—in this case trucks—for other companies or brands.</p><p>Koch's venture arm, Koch Disruptive Technologies, made the investment. But besides the capital infusion, KDT will introduce Gatik to Koch's supplier and customer networks, and other Koch companies as well could become Gatik customers, said Byron Knight, chief operating officer at KDT.</p><p>Mr. Knight said Gatik's service is a good fit for Koch Industries, the sprawling Wichita, Kan.-based industrial conglomerate headed by billionaire Charles Koch.</p><p>\"Efficiency gains in the supply chain are very important to our continued success and we're looking forward to a mutually beneficial relationship with the team at Gatik,\" Mr. Knight said.</p><p>Gatik says its service could one day allow companies to slash costs by replacing the drivers who serve these routes with trucks that could continuously cover the runs solo. The service might also help address a widespread shortage of truck drivers.</p><p>The financing round also included investors like Wittington Ventures, FM Capital, Dynamo Ventures and Trucks VC. With the proceeds, Gatik has raised roughly $115 million since it was founded in 2017.</p><p>While investors have poured capital into autonomous vehicle and mobility startups in recent years, big obstacles continue to dog the sector. Of them, most troubling is the technology's uneven ability to deal with sudden situations in the real world, a factor that continues to keep drivers employed and push out timelines for widespread adoption.</p><p>While Gatik has done limited commercial runs without a driver, most of its revenue is generated by its trucks running routes with an operator still in the cab, Gatik's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Gautam Narang said.</p><p>\"We don't have a business unless we can take the driver out,\" Mr. Narang said.</p><p>Gatik's focus on shuttling between fulfillment centers and businesses is simpler than operating robo-taxis in city traffic and makes it easier to remove drivers sooner, Mr. Narang said. For instance, the company can limit routes to those that only require right-hand turns instead of trickier left-hand turns, he added.</p><p>KDT, Mr. Knight said, is willing to take positions with long horizons and is optimistic on Gatik's ability to perfect its fixed-route autonomous technology. Launched in 2017, KDT invests in startups off Koch Industries' balance sheet, as opposed to raising pools of capital from limited partners. It invests in startups across sectors like energy, construction, robotics and logistics.</p><p>In 2019, Gatik and Walmart began a pilot program where Gatik trucks moved customer orders on a two-mile route in Arkansas between a Walmart fulfillment center and a retail store.</p><p>And earlier this year, Gatik and Isuzu North America Corp. agreed to put the autonomous technology in Isuzu medium-duty trucks. The first of those vehicles will be on the road this year, Gatik said in April.</p><p>Write to Marc Vartabedian at marc.vartabedian@wsj.com</p>",
