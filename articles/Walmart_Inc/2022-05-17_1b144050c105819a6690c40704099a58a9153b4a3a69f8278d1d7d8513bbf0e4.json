  "title": "Technology:  Marriott Puts Data to Use in Media Venture  ----  By Megan Graham",
  "text": "<p>   Marriott International Inc. is introducing a media network this month with Yahoo Inc. that will help advertisers target consumers, in part by using the hotel chain's data on its guests, to bring them ads on places such as the hotel's websites and, eventually, on the TV sets in their rooms. </p><p>   Marriott Media Network comes as the marketing industry is developing new ways to reach consumers amid a wave of privacy changes, including a plan by Alphabet Inc.'s Google to block third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. Brands and ad sellers are increasingly looking to use \"first-party data\" -- information they collect themselves in the course of direct consumer interactions, instead of taking it from third parties -- to target ads. </p><p>   And a growing range of businesses are building media networks that incorporate their own data on their customers. Walmart Inc. lets advertisers use its data to send targeted digital ads to shoppers across the web, for example. DoorDash Inc., Kroger Co. and CVS Health Corp. have also been offering advertisers more ways to reach consumers using retailer data. </p><p>   Net ad revenues for retail media advertising in the U.S. will grow to more than $60 billion in 2024 from $41 billion this year, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. But the space will continue to be dominated by Amazon.com Inc., which is expected to nab 77% of the spend this year. </p><p>   A media network in the hotel category presents marketers with a different array of opportunities, the companies said. On the road, travelers need things like ground transportation, personal items they forgot to pack and entertainment during their stay, said Chris Norton, senior vice president of marketing channels and optimization at Marriott International. </p><p>   \"It's really about connecting advertisers that will be able to fill some of those needs in our ecosystem and bring it together in one spot,\" Mr. Norton said. </p><p></p>",
