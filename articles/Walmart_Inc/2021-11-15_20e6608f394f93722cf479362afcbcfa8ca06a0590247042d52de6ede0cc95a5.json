  "title": "The Elizabeth Holmes Trial: Texas Investor Emerges as Complicated and Fiery Witness for Both Sides; Alan Eisenman invested about $1.2 million in blood-testing startup and lost it all",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Eisenman invested about $1.2 million into Theranos on behalf of himself and his family, making him the smallest investor included in the government's case against Ms. Holmes. The retired money manager and financial planner doesn't have the stature of Theranos's most high-profile investors, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the Walton family of Walmart Inc., and the family of Betsy DeVos, who later served as education secretary.</p><p>Nonetheless, over the course of two days of testimony, Mr. Eisenman managed to capture the courtroom's attention as he sparred with the defense, was admonished by the judge and repeatedly blasted Ms. Holmes and her top deputy as liars who had cheated him out of his money.</p><p>He said in his testimony he would do whatever he could to tell his storyâ€”and he did, at times talking over Ms. Holmes's lawyer and the judge and sidestepping questions from the defense to offer a critical opinion about Theranos.</p><p>In an email he sent to a government agent that was displayed in court, Mr. Eisenman wrote: \"You know that I am a faithful part of your team, and will do all that I can to help your case.\" Defense attorney Kevin Downey said the email showed he was biased. Mr. Eisenman shot back that he had no bias and, like the government, wanted to see \"that justice be served.\"</p><p>\"I think that there was business fraud,\" Mr. Eisenman said. \"I think that I was lied to and taken advantage of.\"</p><p>Ms. Holmes faces a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She was founder of Theranos and ran the company until it shut down in 2018.</p><p>Mr. Eisenman is a striking figure: a tall man in his 60s with white hair and Texas drawl. At one point, he strode into the courtroom and stood in the middle of the gallery, holding above his head a large envelope of paperwork that the defense had subpoenaed from him. He seemed to lean into an aggressive cross-examination from the defense, at times rejecting questions he declared \"misleading\" or responding to a question with another question.</p><p>In one exchange, Mr. Eisenman testified that in 2015 he approached SharesPost Inc., the online marketplace for buying and selling shares in private companies that has since been acquired by Forge Global Inc., about selling his Theranos stock. Representatives from SharesPost told Mr. Eisenman he could likely get at least $14.75 apiece for his shares, which would have given his investment a value of at least $20 million, according to court testimony.</p><p>When Mr. Downey asked Mr. Eisenman about the potential windfall he could have gotten, Mr. Eisenman retorted: \"How is that relevant?\"</p><p>He didn't sell, and when asked on the witness stand how much his Theranos stake was worth today, Mr. Eisenman nearly yelled: \"It's worth zero.\"</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at Heather.Somerville@wsj.com</p><p>The Elizabeth Holmes Trial: Texas Investor Emerges as Complicated and Fiery Witness for Both Sides</p>",
