  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained almost 344 points, or 1.1%, to about 32,567, after rising 450 points at its session high.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 64 points, or 1.6%, at 4,072.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP jumped 248 points, or 2.1%, to 11,911.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow industrials finished less than 0.1% higher, the S&amp;P 500 closed 0.4% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2% to 11,662.79. The declines followed another losing week for all three major indexes amid a selloff that's seen the S&amp;P 500 fall to the brink of a bear market and tech shares crater.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>Investors were buying the dip Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>In volatile markets, \"you're going to get intermittent bounces,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, in a phone interview Tuesday. The stock market probably hasn't bottomed yet though, he said, as high inflation and rising interest rates remain a concern while \"panic mode\" — where the CBOE Volatility Index VIX spikes above 45 or 50 — has yet to be seen.</p><p>\"This is not the time to be going in and buying everything you can get your hands on,\" said Frederick. He favors a strategy of \"picking up very small quantities\" of \"quality\" stocks that are \"on sale\" and investors would like to own for the longer term while realizing that it's probably not a trade \"that's going to pay off right away.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales painted a picture of a healthy economic backdrop, rising 0.9% in April, slightly below the 1% advance forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Auto dealers led the way but most major retail categories posted gains. The increase in sales in March, meanwhile, was raised to 1.4% from an original 0.7%.</p><p>\"Retail sales in April show that the consumer is weathering the inflationary headwinds, rising for the fourth consecutive month,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, in emailed remarks. \"If pricing pressures can moderate enough to relieve some of the pressure on consumers, we expect a rebound in economic growth in Q2.\"</p><p>While \"the consumer is still pretty strong\" in the near term, consumer spending remains \"under threat\" as it's likely to \"deteriorate\" in the coming months \"unless we see inflation come down markedly,\" cautioned Frederick.</p><p>Shares of retailing giant Walmart Inc. WMT were down around 11 % though after it reported fiscal first-quarter profit that missed expectations. Analysts were wary of a slowdown for Walmart amid rising inflation given the retailer's exposure to lower-income customers. Shares of Home Depot HD, on the other hand, were up 1.7% after upbeat results.</p><p>In other U.S. data published Tuesday, industrial production rose 1.1% in April, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday, topping expectations for a 0.5% gain. Capacity utilization rose to 79% in April from 78.2% in the prior month. The capacity utilization rate reflects the limits to operating the nation's factories, mines and utilities. Economists had forecast a 78.6% rate.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything event at 2 p.m., followed by appearances from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and after the market close, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bank of America's May global fund manager released Tuesday showed the highest cash levels since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S., the biggest short position on tech stocks since August 2006, and the biggest equity underweight since May 2020.</p><p>Market watchers have been trying to determine whether stocks have fallen enough to warrant a bounce for hard-hit equities, notably in the tech sector.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of several China tech names rallied, with Pinduoduo Inc. PDD up 5.8%, Alibaba Group Holding BABA shares rising 5.2% and NetEase Inc. NTES edging up 0.4%. Tencent Music Entertainment Group TME gave up an early gain, trading down around 3.5%.</p><p>China's top economic officialgave a public show of support for digital platform companies Tuesday, suggesting Beijing may be ready to let up on a year-long clampdown on technology giants as it battles a slowing economy.</p><p>JPMorgan raised the ratings for the stocks of seven Chinese tech firms on Monday, to overweight from underweight. \"Only in March analysts at the bank had called the sector 'uninvestable,'\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, in a note to clients.</p><p>What companies are in focus?</p><p>* Shares of Twitter Inc. TWTR rose 2.9% after Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk tweeted that his $44 billion deal for Twitter 'cannot move forward' without more data on spam bots. Twitter, meanwhile, said in a statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it was committed to its deal to be bought by Musk for $54.20 a share.</p><p>* Home Depot Inc. HD shares gained 1.7% after the home-improvement retailer's first-quarter revenue and earnings beat Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>* Citigroup C jumped 8% after a regulatory filing showed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B BRK.A took a nearly $3 billion stake in the bank during the first quarter.</p><p>* Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL rose 7%, after the air carrier raised its passenger revenue outlook, citing an improving demand environment. The popular U.S. Global Jets exchange-traded fund JETS, which tracks the airline sector, gained 3.2%.</p><p>* The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old can get a booster dose of the vaccine made by BioNTech SE BNTX and Pfizer Inc.
