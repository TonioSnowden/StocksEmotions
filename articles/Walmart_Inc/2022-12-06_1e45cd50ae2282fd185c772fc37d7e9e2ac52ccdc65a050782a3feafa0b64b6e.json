  "title": "FTC Asks Kroger for More Information on Albertsons Deal; Regulators scrutinize $20 billion deal that would merge two of the biggest names in the U.S. grocery industry",
  "text": "<p>The request extends the 30-day waiting period, established under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, that federal antitrust regulators have to challenge a merger. The window will now remain open until 30 days after both Kroger and Albertsons have complied with the requests, unless the FTC elects to close it sooner.</p><p>Kroger said it still expects the deal, which the companies said values Albertsons at $24.6 billion when including the assumption of debt, to close in early 2024.</p><p>The grocers announced the blockbuster deal in October, saying that a merger would give them greater scale and better leverage in negotiations with vendors. The combination would also give the companies a better footing to compete with Walmart Inc., the top grocery seller in the U.S., as well as Amazon.com Inc. as it continues to expand into food sales.</p><p>As the largest and second-largest U.S. supermarket operators respectively, Kroger and Albertsons had anticipated that the merger would draw scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have ramped up enforcement under the Biden administration.</p><p>The deal would create a powerhouse in the U.S. supermarket industry that would generate around $812 billion in combined annual revenue, according to an estimate by market research firm IBISWorld. Kroger and Albertsons hold a combined market share of 13% of U.S. grocery sales, ranking them just below Walmart at 22%.</p><p>Lawmakers have expressed concerns about the deal's potential effect on consumers. Executives from both companies appeared before a Senate subcommittee last week, where they vowed to keep prices low and protect workers' jobs should the deal move forward.</p><p>The companies, which operate stores in places including Southern California, Texas and Washington, D.C., have said they expect to sell overlapping stores to win regulatory approval.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analysts estimate that the two companies might have to sell off 7% to 10% of their footprint to appease regulators. About 57% of Albertsons stores are located within 5 miles of a Kroger location, BMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania said in October.</p><p>Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com</p><p>FTC Asks Kroger for More Information on Albertsons Deal</p>",
