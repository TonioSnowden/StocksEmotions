  "text": "<p>The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported that retail sales rose by 1.3% in October from September, putting them 8.3% above their year-earlier level. That modestly outpaces the 7.7% year-over-year gain in consumer prices reported by the Labor Department over the same period, so -- with the caveat that retail sales represent only a portion of the spending basket the consumer price data is based on -- it looks as if retailers sold a bit more in inflation-adjusted terms than a year earlier.</p><p>Moreover, sales excluding auto dealers, gasoline stations, building-materials stores and food services and drinking places -- the \"control\" sales that economists look at to help get a read on gross domestic product -- rose by 0.7% in October from September, and was revised higher for the prior two months. That pushed up economists' assessment of where fourth-quarter GDP will land.</p><p>Not all retailers are experiencing sales gains, though. Sales at electronics and appliance stores, which were surging a year ago, were down 12.1% from last October. Department store sales were fell 1.6%. Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores, and at the category that includes sporting goods stores, hobby stores and the like, were up slightly, which puts them lower in inflation-adjusted terms.</p><p>Meanwhile, sales at food service and drinking places climbed 14.1% from a year earlier -- a reflection of how people are continuing to shift spending away from the goods they stocked up on during the pandemic toward services categories. Sales at building-materials stores were up 9.2%.</p><p>In its earnings call Tuesday, Home Depot noted that even though the housing market has slowed markedly, it continues to see solid home-improvement demand.</p><p>The changes in consumer preferences come on top of a shifting economic backdrop. Inflation is high, but looks as if it is cooling. The job market on balance looks strong, but appears to be not quite as tight as it was several months ago, which could slow wage gains.</p><p>High-profile layoff announcements at tech companies such as Twitter and Facebook parent Meta Platforms amount to a tiny sliver of the total U.S. employment, but many of those workers make substantially more than the typical earner, and that could weigh on spending at stores that cater to higher-income consumers.</p><p>So could the sharp declines in stock prices, since the well-off have far more of their wealth tied up in stocks than middle- and lower-income Americans.</p><p>That sets up a dynamic that appears to be good for stores such as Walmart, which on Tuesday reported results that topped estimates.</p><p>The big retailer said that three-quarters of the grocery market share it gained last quarter came from households that make more than $100,000 in annual income -- a sign that higher-income consumers are looking to economize.</p><p>For retailers that cater to the affluent -- or worse, to people who had until recently been minting gains in cryptocurrency -- the holidays might not be so bright.</p>",
