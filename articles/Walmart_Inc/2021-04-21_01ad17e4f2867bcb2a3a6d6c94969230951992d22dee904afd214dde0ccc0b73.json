  "title": "The Property Report:  Blackstone Bets on India's  E-Commerce Warehouses  ----  By Peter Grant",
  "text": "<p>   Blackstone Group Inc., the largest owner of office buildings in India, is about to become one of that country's biggest owners of warehouses. </p><p>   The investment firm is on the verge of buying 3.5 million square feet of industrial warehouses as well as development sites that could house an additional 18 million square feet of logistics properties, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm plans to spend about $720 million to buy the existing buildings and develop the sites, the people said. </p><p>   Blackstone and other big U.S. real-estate owners such as Prologis Inc. and Nuveen Real Estate have been gobbling up U.S. industrial properties for years, leasing buildings as fulfillment centers to capitalize on the explosion in e-commerce. </p><p>   Online retail growth, which has supercharged the value of industrial property in Europe and China, has been more modest in India. Online shopping accounts for 4% of retail sales in that country, compared with 12% in the U.S. and 24% in China, according to Prahlad Tanwar, logistics sector leader of KPMG in India. </p><p>   But the pandemic is accelerating Indian e-commerce because people prefer shopping from home during the pandemic. A new outbreak of Covid-19 cases in India sent cases soaring, forcing the government to order lockdowns. </p><p>   The Indian industrial market became more attractive to international investors in 2017, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented a tax overhaul. Government investment in roads, railways and other infrastructure also helped modernize the country's logistics business. </p><p>   Industrial property is gathering strength in India because online retailers are ramping up in the country. The two largest competitors are Amazon.com Inc. and Flipkart Group, which was acquired in 2018 by a group led by Walmart Inc. </p><p>   Other global players in the India industrial market include the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Everstone Group, a Singapore private-equity firm, which in 2017 formed a new venture with IndoSpace, a local company focused on logistics. </p><p>   Blackstone, which owns 18 million square feet of Indian industrial property, typically buys property and rarely develops from the ground up. But development is a big part of its India strategy because the country offers few large modern warehouses and distribution facilities for sale, according to Christopher Heady, the head of Blackstone's Asian real-estate group. </p><p>   \"You're talking about a country with one billion plus people with hardly any modern warehouses,\" said Mr. Heady, who declined to comment on the pending deal. </p><p>   Some global investors ran into problems in previous cycles when forming ventures with local Indian partners that turned into feuds. </p><p>   Mr. Heady noted that Blackstone successfully worked with Indian companies in the past on office developments. \"Although it has some of the risk you typically experience with development, the growth justifies that,\" he said. </p><p>   Blackstone is planning to purchase the portfolio from a venture of Warburg Pincus LLC and Embassy Group, according to people familiar with the matter. Embassy is one of India's largest property companies and a partner of Blackstone's in previous deals. </p><p></p>",
