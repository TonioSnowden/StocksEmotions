  "title": "Coca-Cola, McDonald's Will Be Last To Feel Pain --- Staples provide some resiliency in downturn",
  "text": "<p>Coca-Cola said it grew global organic sales in the second quarter by 16% from a year earlier, driven by price increases and higher underlying volumes. In North America, organic sales grew 13% while unit case volume was up 2%. Margins are down, but strong revenue is making up the gap: The company raised its outlook for full-year sales while keeping its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance unchanged.</p><p>Less dramatic, but also encouraging, were results from McDonald's, which said global comparable sales rose 9.7%, while U.S. sales were up 3.7%, driven by price increases. Both companies were trading up around 2% Tuesday morning.</p><p>When tough times hit, consumers tend to delay purchases of big-ticket items like cars or mattresses, Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey said on a call with analysts. As things worsen, they might trade down to private-label groceries, but trading down in beverages comes later when people are really feeling pinched. \"So we tend to have long lead times heading into a recession,\" he said. This analysis fits with a statement Monday from Walmart, which said consumers are spending more on groceries and consumables due to inflation, leaving less money for general merchandise.</p><p>At McDonald's, lower-income consumers in the U.S. are trading down to more value items and fewer combination meals, the company's chief financial officer said, but \"high single-digit\" price increases are keeping the chain's top line growing.</p><p>At the same time, Coca-Cola's Mr. Quincey said there has been \"a big, important reprioritization\" in consumer budgets toward things like travel, which consumers \"have missed out on over the last couple of years.\" This especially helps Coca-Cola, which gets a large portion of sales from venues like restaurants, theme parks, stadiums and the like. Away-from-home business, he said, is \"about as good as it's even been.\"</p><p>Consumer staples, in short, are fulfilling their traditional role in investor portfolios of providing some resiliency amid a downturn. But in this unique postpandemic situation, some like Coca-Cola are also offering unusual upside growth. Coca-Cola stock is up around 7% so far this year, compared with a 17% decline in the S&amp;P 500. That is refreshing indeed.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
