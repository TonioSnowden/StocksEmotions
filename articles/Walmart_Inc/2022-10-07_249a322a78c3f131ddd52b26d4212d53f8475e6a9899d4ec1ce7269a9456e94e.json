  "title": "Twitter, Exxon, Credit Suisse: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news",
  "text": "<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.</p><p>Energy prices could shoot higher again following the biggest oil-production cut by OPEC+ since 2020. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies, collectively known as OPEC+, agreed to slash output by 2 million barrels of oil a day. The move, which drew an immediate rebuke from the White House, is likely to boost already-high global energy prices and help oil-exporting Russia pay for its war in Ukraine. Delegates said the OPEC+ production cut will limit Russia's loss of market share; the country has lost about a million barrels a day of oil production since the war began in February. Energy stocks rallied, with Exxon shares rising 4% Wednesday.</p><p>Micron Technology Inc.</p><p>Micron is powering up its U.S. production. The chip maker plans to invest up to $100 billion to build a massive semiconductor manufacturing campus in upstate New York, the largest such facility in the country. The factory would increase the domestic chip supply and create nearly 50,000 jobs in the state. The plans follow the August passage of the bipartisan Chips Act, which subsidizes the construction or expansion of domestic semiconductor-fabrication plants. Intel Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. also have unveiled U.S. chip-factory investments in recent months. Micron shares gained 4.3% Tuesday.</p><p>Hasbro Inc.</p><p>A toy giant is learning that inflation is no fun. Hasbro on Tuesday projected a 15% drop in revenue in the most recent quarter, prompting the toy company to lower its full-year outlook amid worsening economic conditions. The firm—known for Nerf blasters and Monopoly board games—plans to cut costs that would save $250 million to $300 million annually over the next three years. Chief Executive Chris Cocks declined to comment on whether plans would involve a cut in its workforce. Hasbro will also step up investments in its key franchises, like Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Hasbro shares rose 2.2% Tuesday.</p><p>Tyson Foods Inc.</p><p>A meatpacking giant is making some choice cuts. Tyson is closing offices in Illinois and South Dakota as rising costs weigh on the company's bottom line after two years of soaring profit margins. Tyson said Wednesday that affected employees will be given the chance to relocate to the company's Springdale, Ark., headquarters in early 2023. The offices that are closing currently house roughly 1,000 workers, many in the company's prepared-foods and beef divisions. In recent months, Tyson's profits have come under pressure as consumer demand softens and cattle herds shrink, raising livestock prices. Tyson shares lost 1.2% Wednesday.</p><p>Costco Wholesale Corp.</p><p>Inflation isn't costing Costco. The warehouse retailer, which specializes in selling discounted bulk goods to paying members, posted higher salesin the most recent quarter. The company has remained a popular destination as inflation crimps consumers' spending power. Earlier in the pandemic, Costco largely benefited as consumers bought in bulk to limit their outdoor trips. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said the company has no specific plans for a membership-fee increase at the moment—contrasting with Walmart Inc.'s move in August to raise membership prices at its Sam's Club chain. Costco shares added 0.5% Thursday.</p><p>Credit Suisse Group AG</p><p>Credit Suisse is banking that a show of strength will reassure investors. The Swiss bank on Friday offered to buy back around $3 billion in bonds, a way to profit on its troubles and save on interest costs. Credit Suisse shares and debt sold off in recent weeks as concerns mounted over its financial health. The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 2 that Chief Executive Ulrich Körner had told employees that the bank was at a critical moment before it presents a strategy update on Oct. 27, sparking fresh concern and a frenzy of online discussions. American depositary shares of Credit Suisse soared 13% Friday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter, Exxon, Credit Suisse: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
