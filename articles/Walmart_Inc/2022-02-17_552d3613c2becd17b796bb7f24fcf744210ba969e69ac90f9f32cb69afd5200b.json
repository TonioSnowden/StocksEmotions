  "text": "<p>Stocks have come under pressure from the escalation in tensions between Russia and Western allies over Ukraine. The White House warned that a Russian invasion could be imminent, and diplomatic efforts have so far been inconclusive. Moscow said that it had pulled back some troops, which spurred a rally in markets earlier in the week. Western officials said Wednesday that Russia was actually continuing its military buildup.</p><p>\"We've got to put more focus on what's being done on the ground, rather than what's being said,\" said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. \"My presumption is that this will be sorted out diplomatically. If markets go down a lot more, then I would think it would be an opportunity to buy.\"</p><p>He isn't expecting a major change from Russia while its ally, China, hosts the Winter Olympics. The Games conclude this weekend so \"we still have a little while to go before we can feel things have really dissipated on a permanent basis,\" Mr. Jackson said. \"In the interim, it's a propaganda game.\"</p><p>Global oil benchmark Brent crude fell 2.4% Thursday, after rising early on, as traders monitored the Russia-Ukraine situation. Benchmark natural-gas prices in northwest Europe rose 3.2%. Europe is heavily reliant on Russia for gas, some of which flows through Ukraine.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.001% Thursday from 2.044% Wednesday.</p><p>The Russian ruble weakened 0.9% against the dollar. The currency has seesawed in recent days as investors tried to gauge the severity of the tensions, and is down 1.2% for the year.</p><p>U.S. earnings season is ongoing. DoorDash surged nearly 23% in premarket trading after the food-delivery company reported a jump in revenue. Palantir Technologies tumbled over 8% after posting a wider loss. Walmart rose 2.3% after it reported profit that beat estimates and increased its dividend.</p><p>Cisco Systems rose 2.7% premarket after reporting revenue and earnings above Wall Street's expectations, plus an increase to its stock-buyback program. Nvidia declined 2% despite reporting record sales. It said its automotive segment saw a sharp drop in revenue due to supply-chain issues.</p><p>Toy maker Hasbro rose 6.2% premarket after an activist investor began a proxy fight and pushed for a spinoff.</p><p>Weekly U.S. jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, came in at 248,000, up from the previous week.
