TGT tumbled 26% after the retailer reported earnings that fell far short of expectations.</p><p>\"The Target miss on top of misses from Walmart and Amazon certainly is saying something to investors about profit margin pressure,\" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management said in an interview. \"I think there's significant concerns that higher inflation, higher costs are starting to erode the earnings potential at the corporate level.\"</p><p>Shares of Lowe's Cos.

They're kind of using a hammer to put in a screw,\" Kevin Philip, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors said in an interview.</p><p>For Haworth, the emphasis in their portfolio has been global infrastructure. \"Part of our thought process on that is we think inflation is remaining more persistent, so more real assets exposure is is the tilt we're looking at really for portfolios,\" Haworth said.</p><p>\"Because inflation levels are remaining elevated and that's for some segments of the market creating opportunities to to grow earnings, unless we start to see absolute levels of economic activity really come down and take that out of the market,\" Haworth added.</p><p>Read: Fund managers' cash pile is the biggest since 2001, says Bank of America</p><p>On U.S. economic data, construction of new housesfell slightly in April for the third month in a row.
