  "text": "<p>If a deal goes through, it would be another sign of consolidation in the U.S. supermarket sector.</p><p>Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. agreed last month to combine in a $20 billion deal, saying the merger would boost their technology and scale and help the companies compete better against bigger rivals. Kroger and Albertsons said they expect to divest stores to secure regulatory approval; that process is in early stages.</p><p>Southeastern Grocers, which runs about 420 stores, primarily in the Southern U.S., was expected to generate about $9.6 billion in sales in 2020, according to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the planned initial public offering.</p><p>The company also operates more than 200 pharmacies and 140 liquor stores. Southeastern's primary market is Florida, where it competes against Publix Super Markets Inc., Walmart Inc. and Aldi, among others.</p><p>A Southeastern spokeswoman said that the company is always reviewing ways to enhance shareholder value and that it has an obligation to consider transactions that do so. She said the company will remain focused on its strategy.</p><p>Like other supermarkets, Southeastern has in recent years sought to build its fresh and private-label businesses, and to expand its loyalty program.</p><p>Southeastern filed to go public in 2020, then pulled the plan last year, saying that it had decided not to pursue the offering.</p><p>The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, which reduced its debt.</p><p>The pandemic brought a boost to the food-retail sector, as people bought more groceries and cooked at home more frequently.</p><p>At the same time, supermarket operators have said they are juggling higher costs of labor, continued supply-chain challenges and persistent price increases from suppliers.</p><p>Consumers are still spending on groceries, industry executives have said in recent months, but some have traded down to cheaper items and seeking more discounts.</p>",
