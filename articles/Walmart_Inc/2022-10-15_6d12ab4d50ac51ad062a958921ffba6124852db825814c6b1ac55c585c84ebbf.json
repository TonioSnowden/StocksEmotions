  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Kroger Sets  $24.6 Billion  Pact to Buy  Albertsons  ----  By Jaewon Kang",
  "text": "<p>   Kroger Co. said it is buying rival Albertsons Cos Inc. in a transaction that values the company at $24.6 billion, one of the biggest deals in the history of the grocery industry in the U.S. </p><p>   By combining, the companies would gain greater scale and leverage to negotiate with vendors. The deal would also bolster the grocers' market share and technology to compete better with Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. </p><p>   The companies said that Kroger would acquire Albertsons for $34.10 a share, and that the deal assigns Albertsons roughly $20 billion in equity value. They said the enterprise value of $24.6 billion includes the assumption of about $4.7 billion of Albertsons' net debt. As part of the transaction, Albertsons would pay a special cash dividend of up to $4 billion to its shareholders. </p><p>   The deal would create a new power among U.S. supermarket operators that generate around $812 billion in combined annual revenue, according to an estimate by market research firm IBISWorld. Analysts said it could face a rigorous regulatory review, with federal antitrust enforcers having challenged some mergers under the Biden administration. Kroger and Albertsons, which both operate stores in places including Southern California, Washington, Texas and Washington, D.C., said they expect to sell overlapping stores as part of the deal to help win regulatory approval. </p><p>   \"It allows us to do things we are doing in an accelerated way,\" said Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen, who will serve as CEO and chairman of the combined company, in an interview. </p><p>   Kroger and Albertsons began engaging in serious deal talks about two months ago, Mr. McMullen said, though he and Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran have known each other since Mr. Sankaran's previous role at PepsiCo Inc. as the head of Frito Lay's North America business. Mr. McMullen also worked with former Albertsons CEO Bob Miller when Mr. Miller led Fred Meyer stores, which Kroger acquired in 1998. </p><p>   Both companies have been working with attorneys on potential divestitures that they anticipate will be required to secure regulatory approval, Mr. McMullen said. The companies expect that process to take up to two years, he added, with the deal expected to close in early 2024. </p><p>   \"We would hope and expect that the [Federal Trade Commission] would understand this supports union jobs,\" Mr. McMullen said. The deal also would allow the companies to compete better with bigger food sellers by investing in keeping prices low, technology and other operations, he said. They have done work on potential buyers they plan to engage with, he said. </p><p>   The companies expect the integration to take about four years, he said. The combined entity will have a new name, with the companies' current store names staying the same and Kroger becoming the main banner. </p><p>   Together, Kroger and Albertsons could command about 13% of the food-retail sales in the U.S. following divestitures for regulatory approval, according to J.P. Morgan analysts, smaller than Walmart's 22%. </p><p>   The companies said Kroger plans to invest in lowering prices and expects to direct about $500 million in anticipated cost savings to reduce prices for customers. About $1.3 billion will be invested into Albertsons stores. </p><p>   Combined, the companies said they would have a bigger network of stores, distributors and suppliers, in addition to a national reach and greater manufacturing footprint. The companies said they would also be able to deliver fresh products from fields to homes by combining their supply chains, and they would offer about 34,000 private-label products. </p><p>   Kroger, based in Cincinnati, operates more than 2,700 grocery stores, including its namesake locations as well as regional chains such as Fred Meyer and Ralph's, and it generated $137.9 billion in sales in its 2021 fiscal year. Albertsons runs nearly 2,300 supermarkets across the U.S., including the Safeway and Vons chains, and reported $71.9 billion in sales for fiscal 2021. </p><p>   Albertsons' shares fell 8.5% on Friday, after jumping 11.5% on Thursday on reports of the merger talks. Kroger shares fell 7.3% on Friday. </p><p>   J.P. Morgan analysts estimated Thursday that the two companies might have to divest themselves of roughly 350 to 450 stores, or 7% to 10% of their footprint, to appeal to regulators. Creating a strong No. 2 behind Walmart could give the combined entity more leverage in negotiations with vendors and help it push back on price increases, they wrote, though they expect regulators to focus more on the enlarged company's regional influence, versus its national share. </p><p>   Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said in February that it was reviewing strategic options, including potential transactions, to boost value for its shareholders and expand its business, less than two years after the company went public. Albertsons has worked to improve its operations and has benefited from increased at-home food consumption during the pandemic, but its shares have largely stayed flat over the past year. </p><p></p>",
