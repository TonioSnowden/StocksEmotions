  "text": "<p><strong>One Adam Neumann sighting to start: </strong>the<strong> WeWork</strong> co-founder partied with early employees and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae75fcdb-6e63-4d58-bb9e-b22e82105690\">celebrated a $1bn windfall</a> as shares in the office-sharing group started trading on Thursday. </p> <p>Here's a photo of Neumann wearing a “Student For Life” T-shirt just before he and the employees of the co-working business chanted “We . . . Work”:</p> <h2>Dispatch from the Milken Conference&#xa0;</h2> <p>The world had yet to descend into a pandemic last year when then president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/431b35ca-53fd-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\">pardoned</a> the former junk bond king <strong>Michael Milken</strong> for violations of US securities laws.</p> <p>At the time, it looked like Milken would need to wait only a few months for a victory lap at his annual <strong>Milken Institute Global Conference</strong>, a confab ostensibly dedicated to finding solutions for the world's biggest issues.</p> <p>As it turned out, coronavirus got in the way — until this week, that is, when titans of finance and a smattering of elder statesmen finally reconvened at the sunny <strong>Beverly Hilton</strong> <strong>Hotel</strong> in <strong>Los Angeles</strong>. </p> <p>Booming asset prices have lifted the performance of many investment strategies, making already rich individuals even more wealthy. </p> <p>Trump has exited the White House and President <strong>Joe Biden</strong>'s administration has begun targeting private capital more aggressively than ever, an attitude that had many of the attendees, including<strong> Orlando Bravo</strong> of <strong>Thoma Bravo</strong> and <strong>Cathie Wood</strong> of <strong>Ark Investment</strong>, on edge. </p> <p>DD's James Fontanella-Khan, Sujeet Indap and Miles Kruppa attended, and they were mostly struck by the discussion around another hot-button issue: “cancel culture”.</p> <p><strong>Bari Weiss</strong>, the former <strong>New York Times</strong> writer, commanded one of the most engaged audiences of the event, drawing lines between her experience of being ostracised for criticising the “philosophy of woke” to the lives of <strong>Galileo </strong>and <strong>George</strong> <strong>Orwell</strong>. </p> <p>Weiss captured what appeared to be a huge fear among the predominantly white, male and wealthy crowd gathered in LA: that they too could be cancelled if they stepped out of line with mainstream liberal thought leaders. </p> <p>Outside the conference walls, investment managers spread out to neighbouring hotels for rapid-fire sessions where they pitched investors on new funds. Near a side entrance to the Beverly Hilton, anti-vaccine protesters heckled attendees, who mostly declined to engage in debate.</p> <p>Milken organisers said more than 2,000 people gathered at the conference, compared to about 5,000 in past years. Attendance had been capped at half the normal limit.</p> <p>On site, organisers implemented strict anti-coronavirus measures, requiring that all attendees be vaccinated and test negative for Covid-19 within days of the event. Hired staff enforced indoor mask-wearing with red stop signs.</p> <p>“Mike got the most restrictive N95s I think I've ever seen in my life,” said <strong>Josh Friedman</strong>, co-founder of the credit investing firm <strong>Canyon Partners</strong>, speaking on a panel.</p> <p>Titans of finance eagerly stripped off the masks at after-hours parties. </p> <p>At one cocktail gathering high up in the hills, <strong>Oaktree Capital</strong> co-founder <strong>Howard Marks</strong> briefly mixed with bankers and other hangers on, including the Ukrainian former heavyweight champion <strong>Wladimir Klitschko</strong> and the son of <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> co-founder <strong>Leon Black</strong>. </p> <p>Black himself also made a guest appearance on the conference sidelines, months after he was forced out of Apollo following revelations that he had made far larger payments than known to the late paedophile <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>.</p> <p>Most people seemed eager for more Milkens following the deprivations of the pandemic's darkest days. “We've got to get on with it,” said one banker, echoing a common refrain.</p> <h2>Sorry Chamath, Trump is the new Spac king</h2> <p>The former <strong>Facebook</strong> executive turned serial Spac issuer <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong> had a nice run as Wall Street's “Spac King”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The crown now falls on to the head of former US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who in the span of just one trading day, stormed the clubby world of special purpose acquisition companies and took the throne. </p> <p>On Wednesday evening <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c989fd1-2e1a-4509-a478-02bb494f40de\">Trump revealed</a> he was launching a social media platform called <strong>Truth Social</strong>, which will go public through a merger with a blank-cheque company named <strong>Digital World Acquisition Corporation</strong> at a valuation of $875m.&#xa0;</p> <p>Trump's brands, Truth Social and <strong>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group</strong>, are designed “to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech”, he said. </p> <p>Since the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill, Trump has been banned by major social media platforms including <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Facebook </strong>and <strong>YouTube</strong>. Most banks are loath to finance his ventures, both because of the terrible public relations and because of his tendency to run businesses into the ground. </p> <p>But there are few gatekeepers in Spacs. </p> <p>If cable television helped to make Trump president, it may be that Spacs are a cynical enough product to finance a post-presidency resurgence.</p> <p>On Thursday, Digital World was bid up by the day traders that had the over $200bn Spac market humming earlier in the year. Digital World rose 357 per cent yesterday, implying Trump's almost non-existent media business is worth billion of dollars.</p> <p>Hedge funds, who've found the perfect arbitrage in Spacs, once again showed the upside is unlimited. DD's Arash Massoudi, James Fontanella-Khan and Antoine Gara have a look at the funds who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d266e746-27af-46c8-a6d9-4081cfe3cc00\">struck it big</a> on Trump's Spac circus. </p> <p>Others weren't celebrating what might be the best Spac trade in history.</p> <p>“The idea that I would help [Trump] build out a fake news business called Truth makes me want to throw up,” says one large hedge fund investor who owned almost 10 per cent of Digital World. He sold every share he could early on Thursday morning, before the shares really got moving.</p> <h2>Britain's supermarkets lever up&#xa0;</h2> <p>DD readers might remember the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79964b33-2406-41c8-8f24-4ff5552f1669\">intricate series of debt deals and asset sales</a> that the billionaire brothers, <strong>Mohsin</strong> and <strong>Zuber Issa</strong>, and their private equity backers <strong>TDR Capital</strong> lined up in order to buy the UK supermarket <strong>Asda</strong> for £6.8bn while using only £780m of their own money. </p> <p>This week, one of the links in that complex chain broke. </p> <p>The Issas and TDR were going to raise £750m towards the Asda purchase by selling the supermarket's petrol stations to the other company they own, the highly leveraged petrol-pump business <strong>EG Group</strong>. On Monday, they said they were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f18a086-c73a-4555-bad3-85dcf609c2c7\">calling it off</a>. </p> <p>The UK's third-largest grocer will make up the £750m with £500m in fresh debt and £250m in cash from its balance sheet. </p> <p><strong>Moody's</strong> promptly downgraded Asda's debt in response, warning that under the rating agency's definition, gross debt would be almost six times earnings. (On Asda's numbers, net debt is 3.5 times earnings.) </p> <p>Still, the good news for Asda's bankers is that it expects to spend £12m on fees to raise the new debt. </p> <p>So why did the deal fall through? Asda told its investors that fuel suppliers wouldn't give EG Group the same terms that were available to the supermarket group. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcf639c1-2f0c-4d00-8e35-d018d228ab1e\">Catch up</a> on the latest from DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Jonathan Eley. </p> <p>It's perhaps unsurprising if suppliers are more wary of a highly leveraged petrol-pump roll-up. </p> <p>But bondholders are wondering why nobody realised this a long time ago, since the Asda purchase was agreed a year ago and the forecourts sale and its £750m price tag were announced back in February. </p> <p>They're also wondering just how much worse EG Group's supplier terms would have to be in order to merit calling off such an important transaction. </p> <p>The upshot is that Asda will take on even more debt than it already planned to, at the beginning of a new era of leverage in the world of UK supermarkets. </p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tiger Global</strong> has hired <strong>Martin Schimmler</strong> to help boost its presence in European private markets, according to Bloomberg.
