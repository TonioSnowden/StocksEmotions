  "title": "Technology:  Solar  Developer  Nexamp  Gets Cash  Infusion  ----  By Luis Garcia",
  "text": "<p>   Generate Capital, an investment firm focused on sustainable infrastructure, has invested $240 million in Nexamp Inc., as the solar developer looks to take advantage of a fast growing renewable-energy sector. </p><p>   Boston-based Nexamp plans to use the capital to build more solar farms serving communities and businesses across the U.S., said the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Zaid Ashai. </p><p>   The company recently signed a supply agreement with Walmart Inc. covering 23 community solar projects it owns across New York state. Roughly 50 megawatts, or 39%, of the projects' 129-megawatt total capacity will be allocated to the retailer, according to a press release announcing the deal. </p><p>   Nexamp, which is backed by clean-energy company Diamond Generating Corp., decided to bring in a new investor partly to speed up its growth, Mr. Ashai said. In addition to the Generate investment, Nexamp earlier this year raised $440 million in debt financing from a group of lenders. </p><p>   \"We wanted to make sure that we have a robust balance sheet to address all the growth opportunities that we're seeing,\" Mr. Ashai said. </p><p>   Nexamp's operating solar farms can generate more than 300 megawatts of electricity across 10 U.S. states and the company has about 700-megawatts in new projects in the works, according to a news release. </p><p>   It is looking to expand beyond the states where it already operates, which include Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland and New York, Mr. Ashai said. </p><p>   He added that Nexamp can benefit from Generate's \"different skill set\" compared with Diamond, which focuses on solar- and wind-power generation as well as energy services. </p><p>   San Francisco-based Generate, in turn, backs businesses and projects in a broader array of sectors linked to the economy's shift to clean energy, such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, water treatment and waste management. </p><p>   Nexamp plans to offer services to its customers in addition to solar-power generation, as the company believes it can help them reduce carbon emissions in things other than their source of electricity, Mr. Ashai said. </p><p>   \"We're getting customers asking us questions like, 'I'm really happy with community solar. What can I do next?'\" he said. \"'How do I get rid of my gas car? How do I decarbonize my spending? How do I make my home more energy-efficient?'\" </p><p>   Mr. Ashai hopes the infrastructure bill making its way through Congress will help the U.S. revamp its power grid, as improvements are critical to the expansion of the so-called distributed-solar sector, or the kind of local, relatively small projects Nexamp develops. </p><p>   The $1 trillion infrastructure bill shows that clean energy is a priority, but \"bolder\" steps are needed to boost the industry and address the threat of climate change, Mr. Ashai said. </p><p>   For example, tax credits for renewable-energy development could be extended until the U.S. crosses a certain threshold for carbon reduction, he said. </p><p>   \"The infrastructure bill is a small drop in the bucket,\" Mr. Ashai said. </p><p></p>",
