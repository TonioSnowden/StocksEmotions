  "title": "FDA Investigating Possible Link Between Hepatitis A and Recalled Strawberries: What to Know; Outbreak may have originated from two brands of organic strawberries sold at major chains",
  "text": "<p>Experts say that an outbreak of severe hepatitis in hundreds of children is probably not connected to the hepatitis A cases.</p><p>Here is what you need to know:</p><p>Which strawberries are being recalled?</p><p>The affected strawberries were sold between March 5 and April 25 under two brand names: FreshKampo and H-E-B, the FDA said.</p><p>The fruit was sold at chains including Aldi, Kroger, Safeway, Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joe's and Walmart, the agency said.</p><p>The strawberries were now \"past shelf life,\" the FDA said, but may still be in people's freezers. Anyone who stored the strawberries should throw them out.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the FDA declined Tuesday to say how many strawberries had been recalled.</p><p>Where did the outbreak originate?</p><p>The FDA is still investigating the cause of the outbreak. But it said that, based on \"epidemiologic and traceback data,\" strawberries were the likely cause.</p><p>The agency didn't say where the affected strawberries were sold. People fell ill between March 28 and April 30 in three states: California, where there were 15 cases, and Minnesota and North Dakota, where there was one case each.</p><p>At least 10 cases in Canada were potentially linked to the strawberries, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported on May 27. The fruit was sold between March 5 and March 9 in the Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces.</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Cuthbert, a retired professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said it was possible that the virus could have spread from people who harvested the strawberries with contaminated hands.</p><p>FreshKampo, which is based in Fresno, Calif., said it is working with the FDA to trace where the problem occurred.</p><p>Texas-based H-E-B said in a statement that its strawberries are safe to consume. \"H-E-B has not received or sold organic strawberries from the supplier under investigation since April 16,\" the company said.</p><p>Should I be worried?</p><p>\"If they haven't developed disease, then probably not,\" Dr. Alexander Ploss, a professor of molecular biology at Princeton University, said on May 31.</p><p>Symptoms of hepatitis A usually start between 15 to 50 days after consuming contaminated food or water, according to the FDA.</p><p>What is hepatitis A and what are its symptoms?</p><p>Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause liver disease in severe cases, according to the FDA. Its symptoms include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and jaundice. People usually recover within two weeks, but rare cases may lead to chronic relapsing infections.</p><p>The virus spreads through close contact with an infected person and sometimes through contaminated food or water, the agency said. Children under the age of 6 who are infected may be asymptomatic, but they would still be contagious.</p><p>Older people and people with liver disease are more susceptible to serious complications from the virus, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p><p>There are five types of hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A is the easiest one to spread but the least likely to cause liver damage, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.</p><p>Are hepatitis outbreaks rare?</p><p>No, said Dr. Stanley M. Lemon, a professor at the University of North Carolina's medical school.</p><p>\"It's not an everyday occurrence,\" he said, \"but it's certainly not unusual for this to happen.\"</p><p>From 2009 to 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified 37 hepatitis outbreaks that sickened 911 people and killed six. Since 2013, notable outbreaks have been connected to pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey, raw scallops in Hawaii, frozen strawberries imported from Egypt and fresh blackberries mainly in the Midwest.</p><p>While hepatitis A can spread among people, it is unlikely that the strawberries would cause a huge outbreak unless a food handler was infected, Dr. Lemon said.</p><p>How is hepatitis A treated?</p><p>If someone is infected but already vaccinated against hepatitis A, \"no further action is needed,\" according to the FDA. Children usually receive two doses of the vaccine after their first birthday, according to the CDC.</p><p>For people aged 40 and younger who aren't vaccinated, the FDA recommends they get one dose of the vaccine within two weeks of exposure. Those over 40 should instead get an immunoglobulin antibody treatment.</p><p>â€”This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Alyssa Lukpat at alyssa.lukpat@wsj.com</p><p>FDA Investigating Possible Link Between Hepatitis A and Recalled Strawberries: What to Know</p>",
