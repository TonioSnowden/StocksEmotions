  "title": "The Phillies Overcame Their Defense to Reach the World Series; Philadelphia won the NLCS over San Diego on Sunday, in part by improving its woeful defense enough to let Bryce Harper's bat put them over the top",
  "text": "<p>Last to qualify for the 12-team postseason in an 87-win regular season that seemed intent on identifying the team's flaws, the Phillies nevertheless discovered their better game as summer turned to fall. In no area did they come further than they did defensively, which allowed their pitching and offense–Harper batted .400 in the NLCS, including his opposite-field home run through the raindrops on Sunday against Padres reliever Robert Suarez, and Rhys Hoskins hit four home runs, for two–to shine.</p><p>The offense could carry the Phillies because of the work the team had put into shorint up its woeful defense. Late Friday night, when the Phillies had done all they could to lose and then win Game 3 of the NLCS, coach Bobby Dickerson eased through their clubhouse, stopping at a locker, running a hand over a shoulder, rekindling a process that doesn't really ever rest.</p><p>Dickerson is in charge of the Phillies' infield defense, which had just had itself another one of those days—some good, some not, and in the end everybody left breathless but still standing.</p><p>They tell themselves they can be proficient at the catching and throwing of baseballs, and sometimes they are. They also tell themselves to move on from the mistakes, which, for better or worse, can be a running conversation.</p><p>As Dickerson is fond of saying, \"You don't have to wait until tomorrow to have a good day.\"</p><p>That philosophy, along with a lot of mid-afternoon drills and the sort of buoyancy found in Walmart greeters and Peloton trainers, has the Phillies making their first World Series appearance since 2009.</p><p>By advanced defensive metrics, which are inexact, they are by far the worst defensive team remaining. By the more simplistic traditional statistics, however, that being fielding percentage, they are actually quite competent.</p><p>Generally, the Phillies catch the balls that are hit right at them, though there are problem areas at the outfield and infield corners, and even that bare minimum wasn't met Friday night. They also have trouble with the difficult plays, according to the more complex analytical models, mostly because they don't get to balls other defensive players get to, and outs are lost in that foggy area of not-an-error-but-probably-should-have-been-made.</p><p>And then, just to keep the conversation lively and the baseball world guessing, the guy who saved Game 3 with his glove was Phillies second baseman Jean Segura, who a few innings earlier flat dropped a short flip from his shortstop.</p><p>In their first 10 postseason games the Phillies committed five errors, two by third baseman Alec Bohm, two by first baseman Rhys Hoskins and the one by Segura, and yet here they are, pitching around and rallying back from the gaffes that would sink most seasons.</p><p>Segura also had Game 3's critical hit—a two-run single that closely followed his inability to catch a lobbed toss, capturing the Phillies' tendency to injure themselves and then heal up before the groans are fully expressed.</p><p>\"This game is about the mental part,\" Segura said late Friday night. \"At the end of the day, we're going to make a mistake. That's the play that I probably made 3,000 times in my life, but for some reason I missed it.</p><p>\"As a player, you learn from your mistake and you never put your head down. Just keep it up, continue to play the game, because you don't know how the game's going to end. Maybe that play can affect you through the game. So it's just part of the game. When you make a mistake, just keep going forward.\"</p><p>The Phillies have improved. Their inability to defend consistently was a factor in ousting manager Joe Girardi in early June, and it was speculated—and perhaps exaggerated—that Girardi's taut demeanor had exacerbated an already vulnerable aspect of their game. Rob Thomson stepped in, everybody took a breath, Bohm in particular seemed to benefit, and when it became clear their season teetered on their ability to catch the ball, Phillies players devoted a little more time to that.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, hours before Game 4, the Phillies held infield practice, the kind you would see before any high school game, a choreographed dance of two fungo hitters and two balls in play and seven infielders watching the ball all the way into their mitts.</p><p>\"So I just preached to my players, the infielders especially, and [outfield coach] Paco Figueroa does the same with the outfielders, we're gonna control what we can control, right?\" Dickerson said. \"We're gonna try to catch the ball, play within ourselves, not try to do something fancy and if we're gonna make a mistake we're gonna pull our pants up and go back to work…Right now, in the playoffs, things are speeding up on us a little bit again. And that's why I walk around, make my rounds at night and just say, 'Hey look, turn the page.'\"</p><p>They talk about that a lot, pulling up one's pants, clearing one's head, having one bit of misfortune remain one bit of misfortune and not an opening for many. Bohm, the 26-year-old former first-rounder with a soft voice and a big future at the plate, carries the flag for much of what the Phillies are trying to forget and accomplish. A difficult start to his season on the defensive side summoned boos at Citizens Bank Park. He was caught on video telling a teammate, \"I [f—ing) hate this place,\" meaning his home ballpark and the people who populate it, a low point that also marked the beginning of a new effort to pull his pants up.</p><p>There has been progress. The errors haven't buried him. He batted .300 in the first three games of the NLCS. And when the doubts come, Bobby Dickerson isn't far behind them.</p><p>\"You just gotta go through it,\" Bohm said. \"Obviously with the start we had we've been through a few things.\"</p><p>If there is a benefit, perhaps, from being bad at something for a half of a season, it's the knowledge that it doesn't have to be forever. A three-month issue that (for the most part) stayed a three-month issue can be a three-second issue that stays a three-second issue, which leaves head space for two hits that help piece together a lead (Bohm in Game 3) and the gloved two-hopper (Segura in Game 3) that protects that lead.</p><p>\"You don't have to say, 'OK, yesterday was a bad day,' or 'Today I'm having a bad day,'\" Dickerson said. \"Turn the page immediately. You make a mistake, move forward. And you know, for the most part, during our season, we were able to do that.\"</p><p>Dickerson's affection for Bohm is clear. How he admires the courage of a young man who is learning a difficult job in front of all these people and cameras. Sure, the season may be at stake with every ground ball. But Bohm shows up for early work. He sweats through the difficult parts. He endures the judgments of bleacher scouts and computer jockeys.</p><p>\"I'm more of a traditional guy,\" Dickerson said. \"If you get an opportunity to catch the ball and you catch it and you throw it to your buddy and he catches it, you didn't mess it up. Maybe God didn't give you a lot of range out there. That's not controllable today, right? If we had a whole team of Ozzie Smiths, we would be running all over the field catching everything, right? But what we can do is handle the ball when it comes to us. And for the most part, the guys have done that. We've done a decent job of that with a young infield. The shortstop [Bryson Stott] is in his first year in the major leagues. Bohm is 26 years old and the youngest third baseman in Phillies history to play in a playoff game. And he caught the ball, you know?\"</p><p>Mostly he did. Mostly they all did. So far, that's been enough for today. So far, there have been a lot of good days.</p><p>The Phillies Overcame Their Defense to Reach the World Series</p>",
