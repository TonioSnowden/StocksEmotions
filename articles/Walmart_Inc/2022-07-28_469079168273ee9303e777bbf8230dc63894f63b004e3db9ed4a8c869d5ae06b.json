  "text": "<p>Business-inventory woes are playing an outsize role in the economy's ups and downs.</p><p>The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, contracted in the second quarter after shrinking in the first. An important part of that contraction was the result of firms slowing the expansion of their inventories.</p><p>Businesses stocked up aggressively at the end of 2021 to get around supply-chain problems and in some cases in anticipation of robust consumer spending. In recent months, after realizing they had overstocked, many have slowed orders to suppliers and filled sales out of existing inventories, meaning less national output.</p><p>GDP contracted at an annual rate of 0.9% in the second quarter, after contracting at an annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter and expanding at a 6.9% rate at the end of 2021.</p><p>Some people define two consecutive contractions in quarterly output as a recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic group that is the official arbiter of recessions, doesn't: It defines a recession as a decline in activity across a range of indicators, including employment, which has been growing.</p><p>Slower inventory accumulation subtracted 2 percentage points from output in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department, meaning GDP would have grown had businesses not been trimming their stockpiles.</p><p>Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic output, expanded at a 1% annual rate adjusted for inflation. Business investment, another important growth driver, contracted at a 0.1% annual rate after expanding at a 10% rate in the first quarter.</p><p>Many U.S. firms have been warning of inventory problems for weeks. Walmart Inc., the nation's largest retailer, this week said it was cutting prices to reduce unsold goods after overstocking in the first quarter, an adjustment that will hit profits. Target Corp. last month also issued a profit warning, pointing to the bloated inventories it was trying to reduce.</p><p>\"We've built some cushion into our supply chain model,\" said Matt Ellis, chief financial officer of Verizon Communications Inc., which had been stockpiling handsets. As deliveries from suppliers stabilize, he told analysts, \"I would expect to see inventory levels have the opportunity to reduce.\"</p><p>Firms generally like to keep inventories as spare as possible to hold down their own cost of holding goods on shelves.</p><p>If firms address their inventory problems quickly, they could pivot back to normal order and production levels without far reaching damage to the economy. However, the inventory swings could be a sign of trouble.</p><p>In the past, sharp inventory corrections have often been accompanied by broader declines in economic activity, layoffs and outright recession. Such cycles were especially pronounced from the 1940s through the 1970s, when manufacturing was a larger share of the U.S. economy and more of the goods Americans consumed were made domestically instead of imported.</p><p>One complicating factor is that inventory fluctuations have been uneven across industries and companies. Mary Barra, chief executive of General Motors Co., said Tuesday that auto stockpiles remain exceptionally tight. \"The customers are there for our vehicles,\" she said. \"They've been waiting, and all indications are they remain ready to buy.\"</p><p>Another offsetting factor is that some stockpile reductions are hitting foreign suppliers, rather than U.S. firms, which diminishes the impact on U.S. output. An improved trade position added 1.4 percentage points to growth in the second quarter, a sign of such an adjustment taking place.</p><p>The key for the broader economy is how consumers respond in the second half of the year. Business inventories are meant to track sales to customers. If those sales drop, more inventory cutting could be in store.</p><p>\"We are still forecasting positive growth in the second half of the year. But there are substantial headwinds,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a macroeconomic research firm.</p><p>Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com</p><p>Inventory Swing Is a Key Culprit Behind U.S. Recession Talk</p>",
