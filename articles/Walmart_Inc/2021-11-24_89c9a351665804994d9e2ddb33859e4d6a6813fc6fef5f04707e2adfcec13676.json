  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: David Cameron</strong> lobbied<strong> Lloyds Banking Group</strong> to reverse a decision to cut ties with the ailing<strong> Greensill Capital</strong>, appealing to a board member who he had ennobled while prime minister. Full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a71460b3-7023-40b7-aab0-469228b7e517\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Are Spacs making a comeback?</h2> <p>The special purpose acquisition company gravy train has returned to the station just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. And the UK stock market is eager to get a seat at the table.</p> <p><strong>Hambro Perks</strong>, the London-headquartered venture capital firm, will seek to raise up to £150m for an acquisition vehicle in what could be the UK's first big blank-cheque debut since the government overhauled its rules to compete with New York's bustling Spac scene.</p> <p>The Spac will then be used to merge with a fast-growing private European tech business within 15 months, the group announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>Behind the wheel is <strong>Dominic Perks</strong>, a former <strong>McKinsey </strong>consultant and <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>banker who <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/6c3de8fa-2c9f-4748-9199-616fb3af83d1\">told the FT</a> that changes to the UK's listing rules had been “crucial” in bringing the Spacs company to London. </p> <p>But those tucking into London's slow-roasting Spac market may soon realise that blank-cheque deals are juiciest for the sponsors and Pipe investors (aka institutional investors who agreed to partake in deals through so-called private investment in public equity transactions), while retail investors are often left to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7c0f11c-b678-491d-9173-fe49ea29b4b8\">sort through the bones</a>.</p> <p>In the first quarter of this year, for example, US blank-cheque companies broke records in terms of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/321400c1-9c4d-40ac-b464-3a64c1c4ca80\">fundraising</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abcf1dad-833d-4620-ab57-96ea01d918ed\">dealmaking</a>. But when DD crunched the numbers, 65 per cent of the deals completed in 2021 at a valuation above $1bn are trading below $10 — the price at which they were floated.</p> <p>The market seemed to have caught on as redemptions from blank-cheque vehicles soared to an average rate of 52.4 per cent in the third quarter of this year amid a series of scandals. One top Wall Street banker proclaimed: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a9be04e-a298-49bb-a3d8-2efee22bca01\">“We'll never see Q1 again, never.”</a>&#xa0;</p> <p>Never say never. As DD's Ortenca Aliaj and Miles Kruppa report in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1723a8e-c146-4d48-8475-01cc9947a5d6\">this Big Read</a>, a new round of deals is sparking new signs of life into the market.</p> <p>Sponsors are hoping it's a sign of a maturing market, a bit like the steady resurgence of scandal-hit junk bonds in the 1980s.&#xa0;</p> <p>But here's the more likely scenario: a retreat from institutional investors over the past six months, whose Pipe investments previously turbocharged the market, means dealmakers are now forced to rely on a smaller group of initial investors who can then extract better terms.</p> <p>This means that sponsors may be forced to sacrifice a chunk of the huge windfalls they usually receive when a deal goes through, as private investors demand more for their money.</p> <p>But even as the fine print evolves, one thing remains true when it comes to Spacs: the higher up on the food chain, the better.</p> <h2>Decoding the Alden Global Capital playbook</h2> <p><strong>Alden Global Capital </strong>is one of two things, depending on who you ask.</p> <p>Critics call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/hedge-fund-vampire-alden-global-capital-that-bleeds-newspapers-dry-has-chicago-tribune-by-the-throat\">“the Grim Reaper of American newspapers”</a>, one of several unsavory nicknames applied over the years as the secretive New York hedge fund has gained notoriety for buying up local papers and ruthlessly slashing costs.</p> <p>If you ask <strong>Heath Freeman</strong>, the firm's president, it's the guardian angel of a dying industry. “It's important for people to understand that we actually try saving many newspapers from extinction. And put them on a path to sustainability,” he wrote to the FT in an email in January.</p> <p>(Read up on Alden's tactics in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c22075c-f1af-431d-bf39-becf9c54758b\">this informative long read</a>, published earlier this year.)</p> <p>Whatever Alden's motives, the firm wields its signature slash-and-burn methods with calculated efficiency. &#xa0;</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc436442-9105-448d-a4a9-4dc16019f04a\">acquiring</a> the remainder of <strong>Tribune Publishing</strong> it didn't already own in May, Alden has placed a bid to buy <strong>Lee Enterprises</strong>, the publisher of 90 daily newspapers including The Buffalo News, Sioux City Journal and Omaha World-Herald, for $24 a share.</p> <p>The deal would value the Iowa-based media company, which holds a number of papers once owned by <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>, at $141m. Should the takeover prove effective, staff at Lee's newspapers will by now know what to expect. </p> <p>Alden borrows its zero-based budgeting strategy straight from the playbook of feared corporate raiders, as DD's James Fontanella-Khan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/14d29d3f-301f-4f18-ba29-c1964e6d6a6e\">explains in this video</a>: sell prime real estate to recoup the purchase price of the papers, relocate the newsroom, then slash costs by cutting jobs and other resources.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/14d29d3f-301f-4f18-ba29-c1964e6d6a6e.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The hedge fund has now become the second-largest owner of newspapers in the US, second only to USA Today publisher <strong>Gannett</strong>, which it failed to acquire in 2019 when the publisher <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/967b63ce-2885-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\">claimed</a> it was not a credible buyer and had undervalued the media group. </p> <p>And it's not the only player in the game, as local newspapers have become prime pickings for hedge funds and private equity over the past decade amid shrinking print advertising revenues and the growth of online media.</p> <p>Private equity firm <strong>Cerberus Capital Management</strong> served as Alden's financial backer in the Tribune takeover among other transactions. More private lenders could soon follow suit. </p> <h2>The Time Warner fee machine</h2> <p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>'s purchase of entertainment group <strong>WarnerMedia</strong> back in 2016 turned out to be a costly mistake for the telecoms company. But for its bankers, the decision to buy and sell the media company unexpectedly five years later has proved highly lucrative.</p> <p>Investment banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbe6c9e5-5097-4f39-a826-6bb6601565f7\">netted more than $320m</a> from the sale of <strong>WarnerMedia</strong> to <strong>Discovery</strong> earlier this year, and some of the same advisers raked in big fees from <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>'s ill-fated 2016 acquisition, too. </p> <p>Take New York-based <strong>Allen &amp; Co</strong>. The secretive boutique bank, which doesn't have a website or an in-service public phone number, received $75m from Discovery for working on the merger. Five years earlier, the bank made $50m from the other side of the table — for advising WarnerMedia — then called TimeWarner — on the sale to AT&amp;T.</p> <p>Other banks involved in creating the world's second-largest media group include <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, which earned $15m for advising Discovery and a further $140m for financing services. In 2016, the Wall Street firm netted about $32m for advising AT&amp;T.</p> <p>The transaction will combine<strong> Discovery</strong>'s brands, which range from nature to history, with prized Hollywood media assets including the <strong>HBO</strong> network behind TV series <em>Succession</em>,&#xa0; the <strong>Warner Bros</strong> studios, and television channels including CNN.</p> <p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>'s deal with Discovery underlines how rapidly traditional media groups are rushing to compete in the streaming wars. The fees generated by investment banks highlight the rewards on offer for doing and undoing deals for clients.</p> <p>For the bankers, the outcome doesn't matter much. In the words of <em>Succession's </em>Logan Roy, “money wins”.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>KPMG</strong>'s partners have voted to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67380bd4-9625-440e-80cf-bf1be9f47e74\">extend the tenure</a> of<strong> Bina Mehta </strong>as chair of the UK firm until 2024 as it seeks to move on from the exit of her predecessor <strong>Bill Michael</strong>, who resigned after telling employees to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f569449-d113-48fe-b01a-9153f4c3d593\">“stop moaning”</a> about their work conditions during the coronavirus pandemic.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Lazard</strong> has entered into an exclusive M&amp;A partnership with <strong>Independence Point Advisors</strong>, the newly launched investment bank founded by industry veteran <strong>Anne Clarke Wolff</strong>.
