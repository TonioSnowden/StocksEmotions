  "title": "Yum! No, Yuck! Weird Ice Cream Flavors Churn Up Discord; 'We were really worried people might hate it'—and some certainly do, when it comes to savory varieties like ham, wasabi, mac 'n' cheese",
  "text": "<p>So the bagel flavor was the obvious choice when he discovered it—a cream-cheese concoction with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion and garlic. \"Whatever they're putting in there is fantastic,\" he says. His wife, Jemma Rifai, 32, agrees: \"Typically you relegate bagels to breakfast-lunch, but now I get to have a cheeky little spoonful throughout the day or night.\"</p><p>Their $12 pints of Everything Bagel ice cream are from Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, an Ohio company that's among a growing number of frozen-dessert makers offering flavors that are savory—and divisive.</p><p>After Merle Bellot tasted the bagel ice cream at her local scoop shop, the 46-year-old store manager from Sarasota, Fla., begged for samples of other flavors to cleanse her palate. \"All I could taste was onion,\" she says. \"It actually killed my sweet tooth in that moment.\"</p><p>Americans can now dig into ice-cream flavors like pizza, ham, wasabi and goat cheese. Brooklyn, N.Y., ice-cream maker Van Leeuwen in March began supplying Walmart stores with its Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese ice cream.</p><p>\"Texturally, it was such an easy one to make, because we're just using the cultured-milk proteins in the Kraft powder, and all ice cream needs milk protein,\" says Ben Van Leeuwen, the company's chief executive. It didn't add macaroni because noodles become very hard when frozen, he says, and \"We had to add a little extra turmeric to give it that Kraft orangey-yellow pop.\"</p><p>Tasters' reviews range from \"Weird but GREAT!\" by a commenter on Walmart's website to Valerie Storm's critique: \"I had like five spoons before I said 'Nope. I can't do this,'\" says the young-adult fantasy novel author in Tucson, Ariz. She plans to keep the rest for her brother to try before throwing it out.</p><p>The mac 'n' cheese ice cream is among \"disruptive activations\" Kraft is deploying \"to further cement our brands as cultural icons,\" says a Kraft Heinz spokeswoman. Walmart is carrying the flavor until May's end, a Walmart spokeswoman said, and in June will introduce other Van Leeuwen ice creams including Grey Poupon Dijon with Pretzels.</p><p>Savory frozen desserts were once mostly sorbets in fine-dining venues. Two decades ago, chefs were concentrating flavors to single, surprising chilled mouthfuls, says Sam Mason, co-founder of OddFellows, a Brooklyn ice-cream maker. It was a time, he says, of bell-pepper sorbet, wasabi-and-green-apple sorbet and \"anything that would really upset or intrigue people.\"</p><p>Savory ingredients began landing in ice creams more noticeably in the 2010s, food executives say. OddFellows began in 2011 when Mr. Mason mixed a tub of salty-pretzel ice cream. It has since produced ice creams containing beets, tobacco, chorizo, manchego, foie gras and—as part of a New York bodega-theme collection in 2020—bacon, egg and cheese.</p><p>Amateur ice-cream makers like Vicky Johnson-Dahl, too, are joining the savory trend. Ms. Johnson-Dahl, a 37-year-old cartographer, has churned out savory flavors in her Washington, D.C., kitchen such as borscht, tzatziki, sriracha and Philadelphia cheesesteak. \"I like all ice cream,\" she says. \"I especially like to make things that sound initially off-putting but actually taste surprising and delightful.\" Next on her list: sour cream and onion.</p><p>A 2022 survey from market-research firm Mintel found 13% of American adults said the addition of savory elements would encourage them to buy more ice cream. That percentage rose to 25% for those aged 25-34. \"Younger age groups are tending to be more experimental,\" says Sydney Olson, consumer-insights analyst for food and drink at Mintel.</p><p>There's little to suggest that demand for savory ice cream will eclipse sweet, said Matt Herrick, senior vice president for public affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association. At the group's annual Innovative Ice Cream Contest in March, flavors making the long list included miso, sesame and plum, and pandan and spicy Thai peanut. But most entrants were unabashedly sugary, as were the winners. First place in the Most Innovative Ice Cream Flavor category went to a black-raspberry-and-chocolate concoction.</p><p>\"Ice cream in particular has always been seen as an indulgence,\" Mr. Herrick said, \"and having that sweet base is really important to that idea of indulgence.\"</p><p>Jeni's created its Everything Bagel ice cream in 2020, when its development team unearthed the recipe for an everything-bagel topping it had first tried seven years before.</p><p>\"Our tiny team found it to be so deeply delicious,\" says founder Jeni Britton, \"but we were really worried people might hate it.\" They reduced the onion and garlic, but it didn't taste right, and they reverted to the original recipe. It sold out in nine days in January 2021, outselling the company's other flavors every day it was available. Its success saw Jeni's bring Everything Bagel back to grocery aisles and scoop shops in March 2022.</p><p>Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Foods, a trade publication, called Jeni's Everything Bagel \"its most polarizing flavor to date,\" saying \"while the idea of the flavor was met with varying reviews of both overwhelming adoration and vehement opposition, one thing everyone agreed on was that it tasted exactly like an Everything Bagel.\"</p><p>\"I wanted to hate, but it was simply too intriguing,\" says Chuck Anderson, 36, a Chicago-based designer, of Jeni's Everything Bagel. \"I kept going back to it in my freezer for weeks, just a bite or two, out of some kind of bizarre curiosity.\"</p><p>Jeni's previously experimented with other savory flavors, including Parmesan and zucchini bread, and young Gouda with moonshine cranberries. All are sweet—ice cream's \"scoopability\" depends on sugar content—but contain salty and aromatic elements. Ms. Britton embraces some people's distaste for savory flavors, publishing tweets like one calling her Everything Bagel \"DEE-SCUSS-TING\" along with positive reactions.</p><p>Mr. Rifai, who co-hosts a comedy podcast, and his wife, a flight attendant, went through two pints of Everything Bagel in March and ordered four more a few weeks later—just one week before their nuptials.</p><p>\"We felt like that maybe wasn't the best idea with the wedding approaching,\" Mr. Rifai said. \"But we thought, in case it sells out, let's get four more pints to indulge ourselves afterwards.\"</p><p>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</p><p>Yum!
