  "text": "<p>Some 6,500 pharmacies in all 50 states -- including those at CVS Health Corp., Walmart Inc. and regional grocers -- started receiving doses from the federal government on Thursday. They began taking appointments and in many places the slots were filled within hours.</p><p>There is no charge to receive the vaccine, but the chains require customers who are eligible under state rules to schedule an appointment.</p><p>The question of what to do with extra shots can be tricky. Doses, which can expire within hours after coming out of cold storage, might go unclaimed if people don't show for appointments, or if vials contain more doses than expected.</p><p>Pharmacies face demand from customers and their own employees, and they are subject to a patchwork of state and local rules that may forbid vaccinating those who don't meet current eligibility requirements.</p><p>Maintaining wait lists can prove difficult too, as customers can register for more than one list or try to book appointments without meeting state guidelines.</p><p>Each state has its own rules for vaccine eligibility, in addition to guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In some places, a vaccine provider can be penalized for inoculating a person who doesn't meet eligibility requirements, though generally those rules are relaxed when it comes to finding a use for spare doses that would otherwise expire, according to retailers and state guidelines.</p><p>Retail pharmacies are taking varied approaches to extra doses, with some saying they will give priority to their employees while others say they will try to find takers among the public and only vaccinate employees as a last resort, if at all. Most companies say they will coordinate with local health officials to ensure additional doses get to the right recipients.</p><p>CVS and Walgreens-Boots Alliance Inc., which will be the two biggest retail providers of vaccines, say they already have been vaccinating employees in small numbers with leftover doses that are set to expire and plan to continue as they vaccinate more broadly.</p><p>Drugstore employees already qualify for the vaccine under some state guidelines, because they are considered health-care or front-line workers. But companies say leftover doses, in many cases, can also go to workers who wouldn't otherwise qualify, such as cashiers.</p><p>\"Bottom line, we're not going to let a dose go to waste,\" a CVS spokesman said.</p><p>Walmart, which plans to administer federally allocated vaccine doses from stores in 22 states, adding to stores in 11 states already administering doses from state supplies, offers doses at risk of spoiling to shoppers or workers who qualify under state guidelines, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>\"We turn to individuals, including our associates, who fall within that priority to administer the remaining doses. If no one is available in that priority, where states allow, we move to the next priority,\" she said. In some states, including New York, Illinois, Maryland and New Mexico, retail workers are deemed eligible, she said.</p><p>Other retailers are consulting wait lists of eligible customers or announcing spare doses to shoppers at the store.</p><p>---</p><p>Sarah Nassauer contributed to this article.</p>",
