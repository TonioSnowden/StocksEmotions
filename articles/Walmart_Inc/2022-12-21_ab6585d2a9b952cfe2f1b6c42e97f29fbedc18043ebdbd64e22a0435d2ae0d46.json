  "title": "The Property Report:  Dollar Retailers Are  Adding New Locations  ----  By Kate King",
  "text": "<p>   Dollar stores, boosted by demand for less-expensive groceries and goods in underserved rural areas, are far outpacing other retailers in opening new stores. </p><p>   Bricks-and-mortar shopping has rebounded strongly since the height of the pandemic, with many companies now adding new locations. Leading the pack are the two largest U.S. dollar-store chains, Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree Inc., which combined expect to have opened more than 1,300 net new stores by the end of the fiscal year that ends in late January, according to the companies. </p><p>   Dollar stores' expansion shows their ability to thrive in far-flung areas that are too sparsely populated to attract other major retail chains, according to retail and real-estate analysts. Dollar stores are able to bring national buying power to places where the cost of labor and operations is lower than more urban and suburban areas, said Peter Keith, a senior analyst for financial-services company Piper Sandler. </p><p>   \"It's about providing convenience and value to customers that live in more remote areas,\" Mr. Keith said. \"They really can outcompete the local grocer in a smaller market.\" </p><p>   The growth of dollar stores has been significant over the past two decades. Dollar General now has roughly 18,800 stores across the U.S., compared with 5,000 in 2001, according to Coresight Research. Dollar Tree acquired Family Dollar Stores Inc. in 2015, and has since added more than 2,400 locations for a current total of more than 16,000. </p><p>   High inflation has increased the appeal of dollar stores' relatively low prices. But the expansion of the sector is rooted in structural changes in U.S. shopping habits that predate the current economic cycle, according to John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight. Surveys have shown that members of the millennial and Gen Z generations are more price-sensitive and tend to look for savings on retail and household goods in favor of spending more on services and experience-based purchases, he said. </p><p>   Shoppers also are turning to dollar stores for groceries, Mr. Mercer said. Dollar General and Dollar Tree stores are consistently among the most popular retailers for grocery purchases, along with companies such as Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Kroger Co., according to Coresight surveys. </p><p>   Dollar General, which claims to have more bricks-and-mortar locations than any other retailer in the U.S., began offering perishable items several years ago and is now selling fresh produce in about 3,000 of its 18,800 stores, Chief Executive Jeff Owen said during the company's third-quarter earnings call. The company plans to expand to a further 2,000 locations in 2023, he said. </p><p>   The company also is expanding its Popshelf initiative, a concept launched in 2020 that aims to attract higher-income shoppers. Popshelf sells home, craft and toy items, as well as beauty treatments. </p><p>   Dollar stores show no signs of slowing their growth. Mr. Owen told investors that he believes the sector can add 16,000 stores in the coming years. </p><p></p>",
