  "text": "<p>\"TikTok has become a beloved part of life for people around the world because of the creativity and authenticity of our creators,\" the company's statement said.</p><p>The app was the most downloaded nongame app in August 2021, according to Sensor Tower, an analytics firm.</p><p>TikTok said this summer that it plans to allow users to create longer videos, part of an effort to help its top users make more money.</p><p>The company didn't offer a breakdown of users by age in its statement. TikTok didn't respond to requests for more information about the geographic and demographic breakdown of its users.</p><p>The social-media platform's algorithms can drive minors—among its biggest users—to sexual and drug-related content, an analysis by The Wall Street Journal found.</p><p>The company said in a report earlier this year that it removed 89 million videos in the second half of last year. ByteDance also said this month that it would put a 40-minute daily time limit on the Chinese version of the app, known as Douyin, for those under age 14.</p><p>Algorithms and more than 10,000 people are responsible for policing TikTok content, but it has been hard to keep up with the growth of the platform, former executives have said.</p><p>TikTok launched in the U.S. in 2017, five years after ByteDance was founded.</p><p>TikTok ran into opposition in the U.S. when the Trump administration last year issued an executive order effectively banning the app in the country if it didn't find an American buyer to acquire its U.S. operations. U.S. officials had been worried about the user data the Chinese government would have access to.</p><p>Plans arose for TikTok's American operations to be acquired by a group including Walmart Inc. and Oracle Corp. but as of February this year, those plans were shelved indefinitely.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com</p><p>TikTok Tops 1 Billion Monthly Users</p>",
