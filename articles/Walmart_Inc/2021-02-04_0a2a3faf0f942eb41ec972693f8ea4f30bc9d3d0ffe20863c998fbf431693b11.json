  "title": "U.S. News: Minimum-Wage Push Re-Ups Debate",
  "text": "<p>Some large employers have done well during the pandemic, said Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of Mr. Biden's National Economic Council. \"The compensation for their employees hasn't necessarily reflected that. Raising the minimum wage is one way of giving workers a more fair slice of the revenues that they help generate.\"</p><p>Several states, including California, Florida and Massachusetts are on a path to reach a $15 minimum wage, but Mr. Ramamurti said the floor should apply to other areas. \"No matter where you work in America, if you work full time or 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty,\" he said.</p><p>Economists are divided. Some have looked at the patchwork of state and local increases and found little job loss relative to nearby areas with lower minimums. Others say jobs losses tied to a $15 minimum wage could be more severe, especially in states with a relatively low cost of living.</p><p>The previous high for the federal minimum wage was in 1968, at about $12.25 an hour, when adjusting to 2020 dollars. If the current rate were adjusted for inflation since it was set in 2009, it would be just under $9.</p><p>Opponents of a large increase say policy makers should be especially concerned with job losses in low-wage industries, such as the leisure and hospitality sector, which shed 3.8 million jobs last year. More than 37% of workers who earned the federal minimum wage in 2019 were employed in restaurants, hotels and other parts of the hospitality sector, according to the Labor Department. Retail workers accounted for nearly 23% of minimum-wage earners, and education and health employees, including home health aides, represented 14%.</p><p>\"It's a potentially catastrophic policy error,\" Kevin Hassett, former President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, said of the $15 minimum wage. The pandemic, he said, pushed many small businesses to the brink, but those restaurants and other firms are holding on, expecting profits when the economy can open up. A wage increase would cut into those and cause businesses to close. \"It's going to cost a lot of people their jobs.\"</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a 2019 study that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 could cost 1.3 million American jobs. The same study found the higher level could boost the pay of about 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million Americans out of poverty.</p><p>Many businesses support increasing the minimum but don't endorse a $15-an-hour level. Walmart Inc., the nation's largest private employer, starts workers at $11 an hour. Some other large employers, including Amazon.com Inc. and Target Corp. have raised their starting wages to $15 an hour.</p><p>Paul Flick, chief executive of Premium Service Brands, said he isn't opposed an increase, but more than doubling the minimum wage would cause franchisees for the brands his Charlottesville, Va., firm, operates -- including 360 degree Painting, Handyman Pro and Maid Right -- to raise prices for customers.</p><p>\"If they can't afford to buy the service then that means layoffs,\" Mr. Flick said.</p><p>While 29 states have raised their minimum wages above the federal floor, worker advocates say a higher mandate is also needed because employees in large cities such as Atlanta, Houston and Philadelphia can be paid as little as $7.25 an hour. Georgia, Texas and Pennsylvania follow the federal rate.</p><p>Wanda Lavender, 39 years old, said she earns $12 an hour in Milwaukee as an area manager at Popeyes restaurants. She took the position because it offered a raise from the $9-an-hour day-care job she held. She works 40 to 60 hours most weeks but said it is a struggle. An increase to $15 an hour would give her breathing room.</p><p>\"I miss the field trips and the performances and the parent-teacher conferences,\" she said. \"I can't take a day off to be with them because otherwise I won't make my bills.\"</p><p>The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said a $15 minimum wage would lower expenditures on public-assistance programs by between $13.4 billion and $31 billion annually. Those effects are why some Democrats say a minimum-wage increase could advance with a Senate majority through a procedure that generally can't be used for policies with limited or incidental effects on federal finances.</p>",
