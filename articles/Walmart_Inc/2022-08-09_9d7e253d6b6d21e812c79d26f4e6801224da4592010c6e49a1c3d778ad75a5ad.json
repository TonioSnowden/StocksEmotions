  "title": "What Brands Should Know as FTC Prepares to Update Green Marketing Guidelines; Marketers expect expanded definitions for some environmental claims and first-time guidance for others",
  "text": "<p>Federal Trade Commission guidelines for marketing claims using environmental terms such as \"carbon offsets\" are set to get a refresh.</p><p>The agency publishes its Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, also known as the Green Guides, to describe how consumers are likely to interpret certain claims and how marketers can substantiate them to avoid accusations of \"greenwashing,\" or deceptive environmental pitches. It last revised guidance in 2012 and a scheduled update is approaching.</p><p>But some marketers say the guidelines aren't very specific about some terms and don't provide specific guidance on others, including \"net zero.\"</p><p>The update might mean some marketers will want to change their practices or stop using certain claims to avoid FTC scrutiny or enforcement. It could also help level the playing field for those that give priority to sustainability in their marketing strategy.</p><p>Here is what marketers should know about the Green Guides, the coming revision and how some companies are trying to stay current in the meantime.</p><p>What exactly are the Green Guides?</p><p>The FTC's 2012 iteration of the \"Green Guides\" addresses terms such as \"non-toxic,\" \"free-of\" and \"carbon offsets.\"</p><p>The guides are not binding, but they are \"very helpful in assessing what the FTC views as permissible, and what the FTC views as impermissible,\" said Brook Detterman, a principal at environmental law firm Beveridge &amp; Diamond.</p><p>The FTC has taken action against some companies over sustainability claims.</p><p>\"If you're really doing something, you can communicate it,\" said Darrin Duber-Smith, a senior lecturer at Metropolitan State University of Denver's College of Business, adding that marketers must substantiate claims with facts.</p><p>\"If you exaggerate too much, you're going to get caught by the FTC,\" he said. \"And they're going to accuse you of false and misleading advertising.\"</p><p>What can happen if marketers make false claims?</p><p>The FTC can take action if marketers make claims inconsistent with guidance in the Green Guides. Even if it hasn't provided specific guidance for a claim, the FTC can still bring a case against a marketing claim it considers deceptive.</p><p>The agency this year sued Kohl's Inc. and Walmart Inc., arguing they falsely marketed dozens of rayon products as bamboo and deceptively claimed the textiles were made with eco-friendly processes.</p><p>The retailers agreed to pay a combined $5.5 million to settle the allegations, the FTC said.</p><p>The FTC also sued Truly Organic Inc. in 2019, alleging many of the company's products were falsely labeled with terms including \"100% organic.\" The company and its founder and chief executive agreed to pay $1.76 million to settle the complaint.</p><p>What could the FTC update this time?</p><p>The FTC has said that it will update the Green Guides this year, but noted in an email a review hasn't begun. It also said it would seek public comment and might hold workshops once the process is under way.</p><p>The FTC hasn't said where it intends to focus its revisions, but the agency may revisit labels it didn't cover in 2012, such as \"sustainable,\" \"organic\" or \"natural,\" observers said.</p><p>It might also rethink how much marketers need to substantiate claims and the role of life-cycle assessments in them, said Mr. Detterman. These kinds of assessments examine each stage in making a product, beginning with acquiring raw materials and concluding with final disposal.</p><p>\"Recyclable\" and \"reusable\" claims could also see updates, along with claims related to carbon offsets or being \"net zero,\" or balancing emissions produced with those removed from the atmosphere. The Green Guides address claims regarding carbon offsets but they could be more detailed, according to experts.</p><p>The updates could be a rude awakening for some companies.</p><p>\"I think a majority of brands have only started to really think about sustainability and more so responsibility in the last three to five years,\" said Jamie Richards, corporate social responsibility and sustainability lead at hair product brand amika LLC.</p><p>Amika examines each link in its supply chain to assess its carbon footprint, Ms. Richards added, noting that, \"Every piece of metal that goes into a tool is accounted for, every single gram of plastic that we produce is accounted for.\"</p><p>What would marketers like to see updated?</p><p>Ms. Richards said she hopes new guidelines provide more detail on areas such as recyclability because recycling practices and programs vary widely within the U.S.</p><p>She said marketers might want to label something as \"recyclable,\" but certain materials might not be accepted in certain areas. \"You put that as recyclable on both, when in theory, it's not really recyclable in one place,\" she said.</p><p>Mark Abrials, chief marketing officer and co-founder of mattress and bedding marketer Avocado Green Brands LLC, said the FTC should provide guidance on \"natural\" and \"organic.\"</p><p>\"Natural can mean anythingâ€”I mean, it means nothing, right?\" he said.</p><p>The FTC said in its 2012 update it wasn't providing advice on organic claims to avoid being duplicative or inconsistent with the USDA's National Organic Program. The FTC also said it lacked sufficient evidence on which to base general guidance for \"sustainable,\" \"natural\" claims and organic claims outside of NOP's jurisdiction.</p><p>Mr. Abrials said he would like to see more detail on carbon claims and carbon credits related to companies funding projects that lower carbon in the atmosphere or avoid emitting additional carbon.</p><p>Some marketers urged more scrutiny of whether companies actually adhere to guidelines.</p><p>\"I wish there was more accountability for some of the claims that brands make,\" said Abigail Knoff, marketing director at organic mushroom farming company Smallhold Inc. \"I think sometimes it's unintentional. And sometimes it's intentional. But regardless, I think it kind of harms consumer trust across the board.\"</p><p>How are marketers staying ahead?</p><p>The long wait for the next update to the Green Guides has driven some marketers to look elsewhere to stay ahead of the curve.</p><p>Ms. Richards said she watches major environmental policy, guidelines and regulations in the European Union to see where things could go. Amika sells products in the EU but many policies and regulations don't apply to the brand because it is private and too small, she said.</p><p>Marketers are also applying for sustainability certifications from various organizations, which can require implementing plans for reducing emissions, for example.</p><p>Mr. Abrials said Avocado is trying to be more transparent about materials used in its products, partly by using blockchain technology to track them.</p><p>Because of fraud and corruption in the textile industry, suppliers may falsely label a material organic, but recording each step in the supply chain on the blockchain helps Avocado speak about its components with more certainty and substantiation, he said.</p><p>That is important for Avocado because the sustainability of its products and their materials are an important part of its marketing. \"We don't run around and say, 'This is the softest this or the squishiest that,' or you know, 'Oh, feel this,'\" he said. \"We talk about all the reasons for it.\"</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>What Brands Should Know as FTC Prepares to Update Green Marketing Guidelines</p>",
