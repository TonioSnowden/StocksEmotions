  "text": "<p>Who knew napkins could be so controversial? There's a whole diatribe about them at the start of Xochitl Gonzalez's tale of a testy wedding planner struggling to reconcile her Puerto Rican roots with her job servicing the wealthy white elite of Manhattan. Olga Acevedo's clients demand snowy European linen “fine enough for a Tom Wolfe suit”. The hint could not be broader; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349726671?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0349726671\"><em><strong>Olga Dies Dreaming</strong></em></a> (Fleet, £16.99), with its top-to-bottom social span set upon a bedrock of racial instability, does bring to mind that master chronicler of American life — who is here given a 21st-century makeover and feminine twist.</p> <p>Without that Wolfe-like ambition, “Singleton plans perfect weddings but can't find a man” could be a chick-lit plot, but the Acevedo family's complex dynamics allow Gonzalez to cover some intriguing topical issues. Olga's brother Prieto is a congressman staunchly championing the less affluent in his Brooklyn constituency, as property developers mercilessly circle. Their father was a drug addict who died of Aids, and their mother Blanca, a political radical, abandoned them for the cause of Puerto Rican freedom and is now living under cover. Their only contact comes via her regular exhortatory missives, as cold as they are manipulative. </p> <p>With a touch of her mother's heartlessness, Olga is stringing along a wealthy white businessman with interests in Puerto Rico, aware she is cynically exploiting the “passionate Latina” stereotype. Her composure falters when she falls for mixed-race Matteo, who forces her to reconsider her complicity with all that she despises. Olga is flawed and fallible, but gains in self-knowledge and integrity as she's buffeted by hurricane-force plot developments. Matteo, however, remains a gluey romantic cliché in this rich, full-bodied saga. </p> <p>Mara, the protagonist of Sara Freeman's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1783787589?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1783787589\"><em><strong>Tides</strong></em></a>(Granta, £12.99), is a far less gutsy presence, but passivity turns out to be her superpower. Fleeing her marriage after a tragedy, she has washed up in a US coastal resort with no money or prospects save those that relative youth and a striking demeanour can bring her. As the tourists depart at the end of the season, she finds work and shelter at a wine shop. As well as being beautifully atmospheric, <em>Tides</em> is an intriguing exploration of the effect of sheer propinquity on romance. Like a barnacle, Mara clings to sad-sack Simon the proprietor, in the temporary absence of his glamorous wife, but finds herself becoming obsessed with his sheer ordinariness. How the venture ever makes money when Simon and Mara seem to be drinking half the stock themselves is a mystery. </p> <p>Equally rootless, but much more desperate, is Henry in Jakob Guanzon's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349702691?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0349702691\"><em><strong>Abundance</strong></em></a>(Dialogue Books, £14.99), living in his car with his seven-year-old son and namesake, after being evicted from a trailer park. Each chapter is headed by a dollar amount, underlining the pair's destitution, although the narrative also flashes back to more affluent, if not happier times, where we encounter vivid characters such as Henry's alluring but mean-spirited wife Michelle, and his best friend Al, whose hustles net the biggest return in both money ($50,000) and misery. </p> <p>Guanzon's lush prose elevates the backdrop of Walmart aisles, cruddy motels and public washrooms to a kind of grim poetry as the pair move restlessly onwards. Henry Sr provides a flimsy celebration for the boy's birthday with his last few dollars, irritated beyond measure by the child's grudging apathy. Every harsh word Henry utters only evokes memories of his own disciplinarian father, a Filipino immigrant, whom he fears to emulate. Guanzon's beady attention to detail and descriptive riffs often slow the action, but when the trajectory gives every indication of plunging endlessly downwards that feels like a mercy. </p> <p>Composed of blog posts, 4chan threads, records of police interviews and recovered text messages linked by an oblique narrative, Nat Ogle's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1788168356/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1788168356&amp;linkId=01c669b8a171d2c56c5a10fbb7c4247c\"><em><strong>In the Seeing Hands of Others</strong></em></a> (Serpent's Tail, £14.99) examines the psychology of those who care, and those who harm. </p> <p>The novel's central question is whether moderately successful actor Cameron Struth raped nurse Corina Slate after a drunken party in London. Corina's victim blog is vague on details, and it's not clear how much of Cam's lurid online existence, used in evidence, is the product of fantasy. As the legal case plods on, Corina continues to work in a renal unit, seeing in Ali, an anorexic patient, a mirror of her own trauma. <em>In the Seeing Hands of Others</em> feels overloaded with weighty themes not fully integrated but is nevertheless impressively ambitious and gripping.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Suzi Feay 2022 'Debut fiction: a showcase of emerging novelists' FT.com 6 January.
