  "title": "Inflation in Japan Is Finally Rising, but the BOJ Will Take It Easy With Monetary Policy; Central bank says with consumer demand still weak, higher interest rates could choke off economic growth",
  "text": "<p>Japan's consumer-price inflation is expected to approach the Bank of Japan's longstanding 2% target in the next month or two. That reflects surging energy prices, supply-chain bottlenecks and the yen's recent fall to a 20-year low against the U.S. dollar, which tends to push up the price of imports such as oil and food.</p><p>The normal central-bank playbook in such a situation would be to prepare for higher interest rates to control inflation. Higher rates would also tend to draw investor money into the yen, giving Japan a stronger currency with which to buy imports.</p><p>But the Bank of Japan, led by Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda, says it isn't ready to follow the Fed, which is preparing for multiple interest-rate increases this year. BOJ officials believe the current inflation is a one-time phenomenon driven by factors outside of Japan's control.</p><p>In the BOJ's mind, such \"cost-push\" inflation contains the seeds of its own demise because it is likely to tamp down demand and cool the economy.</p><p>\"Cost-push inflation caused by rising energy prices has negative effects on the Japanese economy by reducing households' real income and companies' earnings,\" Mr. Kuroda said in Parliament on Monday. \"It is appropriate to continue easy monetary policy so we can achieve the 2% inflation target in a stable and sustainable manner.\"</p><p>Government numbers coming Friday are expected to show overall consumer-price inflation slightly topped 1% in March. Economists say the figure is likely to reach 2% in April or May, when the effects of price cuts last year for cellphone service taper off.</p><p>Except for brief intervals, Japan hasn't seen such numbers since the 1990s. Yet the situation is a far cry from the U.S. The difference isn't just in the extent of inflation—consumer prices in the U.S. rose 8.5% in March—but also in the attitudes of consumers.</p><p>U.S. consumers have helped accelerate price increases by snapping up houses, cars and electronics, even if they cost more. In Japan, price increases are mainly triggered by companies trying to preserve profit margins amid higher costs for inputs such as fuel and raw materials. The economy remains smaller than its prepandemic level.</p><p>\"We cannot raise prices easily, considering Japan's current economic conditions,\" said Tadashi Yanai, head of Uniqlo clothing-store operator Fast Retailing Co., at a news conference April 14.</p><p>Some supermarket chains including Seiyu Co., in which Walmart Inc. holds a minority stake, have promised not to raise prices of their store-brand products until at least June 30, seeking to steal market share from brands that are raising prices.</p><p>The BOJ's Mr. Kuroda said he didn't like to see the yen rapidly weaken because smaller companies have trouble passing on the cost of higher import prices and would see their profits decline. On Wednesday, a dollar bought as much as ¥129.40—the weakest level for the yen since April 2002—compared with around ¥115 at the beginning of this year.</p><p>Japan is closed to tourists because of Covid-19 restrictions, so a typical benefit of a cheap currency—luring bargain-hunting foreigners—doesn't apply at the moment. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki labeled the recent moves a \"bad weakening of the yen.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, people familiar with the BOJ's thinking say policy makers are reluctant to raise interest rates purely as a response to exchange rates. A small rate increase might not impress markets much when the Fed moves are so much bigger, they say.</p><p>Analyst Kota Nakayama of Nowcast Inc., which tracks minute-by-minute purchases at supermarkets, said Japan's chief economic concern now was weak demand, not an overheating economy where prices could get out of control. The modest price increases so far have already hit demand in recent weeks, he said.</p><p>\"If retail sales, including supermarkets and convenience stores, remain weak in April and May, it would make it difficult for companies to have the higher price tags,\" Mr. Nakayama said.</p><p>Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com</p><p>Inflation in Japan Is Finally Rising, but the BOJ Will Take It Easy With Monetary Policy</p>",
