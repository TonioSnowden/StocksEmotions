  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>We report today from both ends of the debate about pandemic restrictions, as the UK forges ahead with its “living with Covid” policy while China tightens its “zero Covid” rules, with both stances encountering heavy resistance.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25467fcf-c73f-461a-b64d-51585914b14e\">NHS leaders</a> today demanded ministers disclose the scientific basis for the premature relaxation of rules in England, which could see the end of free lateral flow tests as well as the requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid-19 test. They also argue that a subsequent uptick in infections could wreck plans to reduce health service waiting lists, which have lengthened considerably during the pandemic. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0c3ebc5-12cc-41f8-943b-639dff0b2fac\">return to the office</a> has picked up, with workplace occupancy in the UK hitting 27 per cent this week — the highest since the pandemic began. This is however still far short of pre-crisis levels, with the full effect of hybrid working yet to be seen. Other measures of activity such as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ec55a45-0dc1-458e-bf7d-4b6ec21e2f3e\">number of flights</a> arriving in and leaving the UK are also on the rise.</p> <p>Contrast all this with the picture in Hong Kong, where a return to some kind of normality seems a very long way off, even prompting an announcement today that the territory's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808#post-36300b1b-bb71-45da-b301-3e9e20dfcccb\">leadership elections</a> would be postponed from March until May.</p> <p>Even as infections surge — highlighted by today's closure of part of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808#post-35501f73-8714-4fbf-9bb4-0114665ff2c9\">HSBC's main office</a> after several staff were found to be infected — the city's local business community has been chafing against China's strict pandemic restrictions. These include&#xa0;isolating all positive cases in hospitals and quarantine centres, even if people have only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic.</p> <p>Beijing fears the Hong Kong outbreak — China's worst in more than two years — could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79bd3e9b-74cf-4f3f-8cff-d940d16021a7\">threaten the mainland</a>, but banks such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ec62479-db75-464d-b00a-7001dda419a4\">Standard Chartered</a> say the measures risk the territory losing its prized status as a financial hub.</p> <p>The FT revealed yesterday that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3e2214d-2b6c-4f41-815c-a88620088f55\">Prudential</a>'s new chief might have to start the job from outside the city because of the “friction” created by the rules, while international companies from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3e6a001-96b0-423f-9ab2-176a3bdc69b3\">Pernod Ricard</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b503f89-7ec4-438a-8f67-357c1d0c3253\">Mandarin Oriental</a> are already looking at temporarily relocating staff elsewhere.</p> <p>However, complaints are likely to fall on deaf ears. According to one veteran member of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing camp, President Xi Jinping would not hesitate to take <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79bd3e9b-74cf-4f3f-8cff-d940d16021a7\">more drastic measures</a> to eradicate the outbreak and restore the territory to near-zero Covid levels. “Do not,” he said, “underestimate the Communist party's determination.”</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Eurozone consumer confidence <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808#post-0edde3d2-178f-4f36-a5c4-31891a520376\">has fallen to an 11-month low</a> </p></li>  <li><p>Oxford university researchers said long Covid was emerging as a major long-term issue for global healthcare systems (Reuters)</p></li>  <li><p>Deere <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808#post-ef8bd101-4fa6-4298-ba46-ff8043f30e3c\">raised its profit forecast</a> as supply chain problems and increased production costs were offset by strong demand and higher prices for its agricultural machinery</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>Former UK prime minister <strong>Gordon Brown </strong>said sharing the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36903dc7-4064-4daf-8a50-c56254c14abc\">global Covid burden</a> was one of the most cost-effective investments G20 countries could make this year. “The world will be a more dangerous place, and global recovery impeded, if an item that has been at the top of finance ministers' agendas for the past two years — the pandemic and the financing of the global health response — is downgraded . . . out of a misguided complacency that we are&#xa0;now in the Covid endgame,” he writes.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p><strong>UK retail sales</strong> rebounded a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66df851b-6d3d-4fa7-a5c2-b639d7bc25af\">better than expected 1.9 per cent</a> in January after shrinking the previous month.

In contrast to Segro, those reliant on income from bricks and mortar stores have struggled to recoup rents.</p> <p>Economic disparities between <strong>UK regions</strong> have widened during the pandemic, giving new impetus to the government's “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808#post-19983bb2-4c29-4ba5-b264-2157af5c305f\">levelling up</a>” proposals.</p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank's </strong>chief economist has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/caff1285-89dd-41c9-bdb6-db9a56f334e5\">shifted his position on inflation</a> by saying it looks unlikely to drop below the ECB's 2 per cent target in the next two years, notes Frankfurt bureau chief Martin Arnold. Inflation is the key factor in determining how quickly the ECB should start dismantling its stimulus programme.</p> <p>In <strong>energy news</strong>, the head of Italian oil major <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32331a55-817c-46fc-87f7-a08e150294b7\">Eni</a> said the gas market would remain tight for at least four years as it reported its highest annual profits since 2021, while France said it would pump €2bn into state-controlled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af3401c0-8bd2-4597-bd84-0184c75624bd\">EDF</a> to help the group with production problems.

The French carmaker warned however that it expected to make 300,000 fewer vehicles this year because of the global chip shortage. It also warned of supply chain problems for its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01295576-e1d4-4d91-9495-0bd5dfe4b808#post-4ab04142-e100-44ac-8a04-3ea813da5cbc\">Russian plants</a> if the situation in Ukraine escalates. </p> <p>There were more encouraging signs for the future of air travel as aircraft maker <strong>Airbus</strong> bounced back with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38d9a0c2-fdbb-4713-9b37-3ffe8b48da15\">record profits of €4.2bn</a> and announced its first dividend since the onset of the pandemic. <strong>Air France-KLM</strong> announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/baa738f7-afa3-421d-8e63-0c3ea1d64df4\">repay state aid</a> and raise fresh capital after a lower than expected loss for 2021 and fourth-quarter operating income above pre-pandemic levels.
