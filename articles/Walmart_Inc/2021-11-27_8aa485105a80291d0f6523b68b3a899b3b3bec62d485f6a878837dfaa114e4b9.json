  "text": "<p>\n  Recently Mr. Mattingly has been keeping closer to home on his routes, concerned about the rising cost of diesel fuel and extended repair times in the event his 2016 Freightliner breaks down. Any delays could cut into his earnings, especially during the busy peak season leading into the holidays. </p><p>\n  \"What has me worried the most with supply-chain shortages is parts,\" Mr. Mattingly said. \"I'm a one-guy, one-truck operation. Depending on how long it's down, it could put me on the poor farm.\" </p><p>\n  He took time off around Thanksgiving for doctor and veterinary appointments, he said. \"But as soon as I can, I'm going to haul everything I can between now and Christmas.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'Putting out fires' </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Lori Giffin's job as receiving manager at Sweetwater Sound Inc., an online retailer of music instruments, is usually as regular as a metronome. This year has been anything but normal. </p><p>\n  The supply-chain problems have meant irregular arrivals of trailers and containers brimming with guitars, drums, amplifiers and other musical wares. Some days, no freight containers from Asia arrive at the company's Fort Wayne, Ind., distribution center. Then, on another day, two containers may arrive on top of each other, leading to a scramble to get the goods unloaded, sorted and stacked in the building. </p><p>\n  \"It's very unpredictable these days,\" said Ms. Giffin, who has worked for the company for 13 years. \"We take what we can get.\" </p><p>\n  The 58-year-old said that in prior years inbound freight would have been mostly wrapped up by early November. But now, the company is still getting containers that should have arrived weeks ago, and she plans to continue to receive shipments up until Christmas. That means she must manage new imports at the same time her facility is shipping holiday orders out to customers. </p><p>\n  Ms. Giffin leaves home around 4:20 a.m. and arrives at the warehouse before 5 a.m., where she oversees a group of forklift drivers, sorters and other hourly workers. Often, she'll chip in moving items off the trucks arriving at the more than 500,000-square-foot warehouse. </p><p>\n  Parts of her day still have a routine. One or two trucks usually show up when she arrives. Later, three trucks from FedEx and one from UPS arrive, each with up to 2,000 boxes to unload. </p><p>\n  The unpredictable arrival of other trailers causes the most problems. The receiving area is staffed based on expected work, but when trailers don't show up, she finds tasks to keep employees busy. \"You can only sweep a floor so many times,\" Ms. Giffin said. </p><p>\n  When a trailer arrives unplanned, she may have to borrow some workers who would be packing purchases bound for homes. \"I'm just putting out fires all over the place,\" she said, with a month to go before the peak season ends. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  'The finish line' </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Dave Erazo sees the end of the road for many goods reaching homes. The 32-year-old manages inbound operations at a FedEx Ground station in Sunnyside, Queens, N.Y., overseeing workers that sort packages entering the facility and load them onto delivery trucks headed to homes. </p><p>\n  Many of these goods are online orders that were made in factories far away, shipped on cargo boats, and have changed hands several times before being packed in an e-commerce box. Once the goods have reached a FedEx hub, many of the snarls have been sorted out. </p><p>\n  \"Peak season is a test of all the processes you're putting in place,\" said Mr. Erazo, who has worked at FedEx for 11 years. </p><p>\n  Labor shortages this year at other FedEx sorting facilities have meant that hundreds of thousands of packages have been rerouted daily to intermediary locations that have enough workers to process them before they reach stations such as the Sunnyside facility. FedEx is hiring 90,000 workers ahead of the holidays in anticipation of more than 10% increase in shipping volume compared with last year. The company said that additional hiring, added capacity and more measures being taken have reduced the number of packages being rerouted lately. </p><p>\n  Mr. Erazo comes in after midnight to prepare for the overnight sort, when a stream of trailers, either from other FedEx locations or retailers like Walmart Inc., arrive with their loads. He and other managers go over volume projections for the day and map out the day. </p><p>\n  About 300 or more workers staff the shift. They unload the packages onto conveyors, where the boxes are scanned and zoomed around to one of six locations. Loaders put them on hundreds of trucks that fan out in the area, delivering packages. </p><p>\n  The center gets around 40,000 packages a day, but that can rise up to 70,000 or more during the busiest days. The operation wraps up around 7 a.m. He goes home afterward to get six or seven hours of sleep to recharge. </p><p>\n  \"We're basically the finish line,\" Mr. Erazo said. \"When it gets on the vehicle, that's when it gets delivered.\" </p><p></p>",
