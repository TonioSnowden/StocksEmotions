  "title": "Envision Lenders Hire Legal Adviser as Group Prepares Counter Financing Offer; Creditors and other investors are jockeying for position over a debt deal to help shore up the physician-staffing company's liquidity",
  "text": "<p>Raising new capital would help shore up liquidity for Envision, which is backed by private-equity firm KKR &amp; Co., even though it isn't in dire need of cash.</p><p>But if the company does a deal on Pimco's terms, the assets that would secure the new debt might be shifted to a subsidiary that is out of reach of other, nonparticipating lenders, the people said.</p><p>The lenders have been looking for ways to engage with Envision for an alternative proposal that would better protect their interests, including raising new capital that would be more senior to the existing debt, the people said.</p><p>KKR declined to comment. Representatives Envision and Kasowitz didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Kasowitz, a litigation firm that was brought on last week, will join restructuring adviser Guggenheim Partners to advise the group, one of the people said. Bloomberg earlier reported Kasowitz's hiring.</p><p>Since KKR took Envision private in 2018 for roughly $6 billion, the business has struggled partly because of its contract battles against UnitedHealth Group Inc. after the staffing company was cut out of the insurer's network. Additionally, revenue from contracts to provide hospitals with medical professionals took a hit as visits to emergency rooms dropped during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In April 2020, lenders objected to Envision's attempt at a debt swap to cut its roughly $7 billion debt load. As part of the plan to swap a total of $1.225 billion of bonds, unsecured bondholders holding $200 million in bonds were asked to exchange their bonds for roughly 50 cents on the dollar in new debt with stronger claims on repayment.</p><p>Other creditors and investors have also been looking for ways to offer financing for Envision, which is advised by PJT Partners Inc. and Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP. Potential outside investors including Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and HPS Investment Partners LLC have been talking to the company about possible financings in recent months, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Alexander Gladstone contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jodi Xu Klein at jodi.klein@wsj.com, Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com and Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
