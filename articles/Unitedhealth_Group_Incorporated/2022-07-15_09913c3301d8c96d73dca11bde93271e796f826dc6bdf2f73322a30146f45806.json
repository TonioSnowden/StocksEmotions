  "text": "<p>Investors are trying to assess how officials will balance the need to tame inflation with concerns over a potential recession. U.S. consumer inflation accelerated to 9.1% in June, a pace not seen in more than four decades, causing some traders to expect more aggressive interest-rate increases to tame it. At the same time, tightening of financial conditions could weigh on growth.</p><p>More than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity is tied to household spending. Recessions typically are accompanied by a pullback by consumers. Economists expect the Commerce Department to report that Americans' retail spending rose in June, after declining in May, when figures are released at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p><p>The University of Michigan will publish an initial reading of its consumer-sentiment survey for July at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect the report to show there was a slight improvement in consumer's moods in July from June's final reading, when it fell to its lowest point on record.</p><p>\"Recession risks have risen since the beginning of the year,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"If we don't get any signal of consumer retrenchment, maybe it's not as bad as people fear, but if we do get that it's a signal recession risk is materializing.\"</p><p>Some of the largest U.S. financial companies reported earnings ahead of the market open. BlackRock shares edged down 1.8% in premarket trading after its second-quarter profit fell 22% amid a bruising market downturn. Wells Fargo shares ticked 0.6% lower after its second-quarter profit declined 48%. Citigroup shares rose 2.3% after it posted results.</p><p>Shares of Pinterest jumped 13% premarket after The Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Elliott Management has taken a big stake in the social-media company. Vonage Holdings shares rose 6.7% premarket after Swedish telecom-equipment giant Ericsson said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. had authorized its $6.2 billion proposal to buy Vonage.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group shares added 1.5% after the company raised its outlook for the second consecutive quarter and posted higher revenue and profit for the recently ended period.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.936% from 2.957% Thursday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 1.8% to $101.88 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.7%, though the index is poised to close out the week with losses. Italian political turmoil and worries that the Kremlin will end supplies to the Nord Stream pipeline that channels Russian natural gas to Europe have added to recession fears for the continent.</p><p>In Asia, China's Shanghai Composite fell 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 2.2%. China recorded its weakest growth rate in more than two years, a measure of the costs imposed on the world's second-largest economy by Beijing's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19.</p><p>South Korea's Kospi added 0.4%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Edge Up as Bank Results Roll In</p>",
