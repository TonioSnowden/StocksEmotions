  "title": "Pro Take: KKR Sets Off Investor Fight to Keep Envision Afloat; Loan-market competition helps private-equity owners find ready capital to prop up troubled companies at creditors' expense",
  "text": "<p>Envision settled on borrowing $2.6 billion from Centerbridge, Angelo Gordon and HPS Investment Partners LLC, while handing them nearly that much in asset collateral that had previously been pledged to term lenders, people familiar with the matter said. The financing helps the company avoid a potential cash crunch, but has alienated most of its lender base.</p><p>That group, including Blackstone Credit and SVPGlobal, lost access to Envision's valuable ambulatory-service unit, AmSurg Corp., and were pushed down in the repayment order. The lenders are now weighing their legal options, saying they were blindsided by a deal that raided their collateral, according to people familiar with the matter. Blackstone and SVP declined to comment.</p><p>The new loans taken out by Envision free up KKR from needing to invest more into the company, while buying it time to weather the headwinds it has faced since its 2018 buyout. The business took a hit from declining emergency room visits during the Covid-19 pandemic and from legal battles against insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc.</p><p>Now Envision has $600 million less in debt after it retires $1.9 billion of a term loan at a discount. Lenders that agreed to the discounted deal include Pacific Investment Management Co., King Street Capital Management LP and Sculptor Capital Management Inc., said the people familiar with the matter. That left creditors holding the remainder of the original $5.5 billion term loan in a worse place.</p><p>Blackstone Credit and an SVPGlobal-led group also proposed separate financings that Envision rejected.</p><p>Private-equity firms have built reputations for engineering creative legal and financial moves to protect their investments, saddling portfolio companies with debt, sometimes at lenders' expense. The luxury of picking and choosing deals comes from the intense competition in the loan market to put capital to work and generate returns during years of ultralow interest rates.</p><p>Distressed-debt and special-situations hedge funds were sitting on more than $750 billion at the end of the first quarter, with the rate of corporate defaults sitting near historic lows, according to data provider HFR. More hedge funds are now playing in the loan space, proactively offering financing to at-risk borrowers, and competing against each other for the same deals, according to people in the industry.</p><p>Many debt deals struck in recent years lack protections for investors, giving private-equity firms an avenue for more aggressive financing. Envision, for example, said its loans, which were taken out in 2018 to fund KKR's buyout of the company, allow the flexibility to move assets elsewhere to incur more debt when liquidity needs rise, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Other businesses have also used loosely written debt documents to take out rescue financing. Online platform Travelport Worldwide Ltd. and cosmetics maker Revlon Inc. secured new debt during the Covid-19 pandemic backed by assets transferred away from other lenders.</p><p>For Envision, the Centerbridge deal was superior because it leaves a lot of room to issue more debt in the future, giving the company flexibility, while the SVP-led offer locked in much of the assets to SVP, leaving little room for Envision to maneuver, according to people familiar with the negotiations.</p><p>Blackstone and SVPGlobal tried the traditional distressed-investing approach with Envision, offering to invest ahead of the company's $5.5 billion term loan, which would leave them as the senior-most term lender.</p><p>It didn't go as planned. Distressed investing has gotten tougher when more players can swoop in, offer better terms, and snatch the deal.</p>",
