  "title": "Mallinckrodt Drug Insurers Denied Priority Bankruptcy Claims Tied to Alleged Price Gouging; A bankruptcy judge says Humana and others failed to prove the company is violating antitrust law in the pricing of its flagship drug, Acthar",
  "text": "<p>As a result, the insurers aren't entitled to the $382 million in top-ranking administrative claims they had brought against Mallinckrodt in its chapter 11 proceedings, Judge Dorsey said.</p><p>Humana and others had sued Mallinckrodt before its bankruptcy over price increases for Acthar, which is used to treat infantile spasms, multiple sclerosis and other ailments and costs roughly $38,000 a vial, up from about $50 in 2001.</p><p>The insurer argued the cost of any wrongdoing should continue to accrue while Mallinckrodt is in bankruptcy and be treated as administrative expenses, which must be paid in full ahead of other creditors for the company to leave chapter 11. Humana has said it continues to pay about $7.5 million every month for the drug, a price it alleged is inflated by anticompetitive conduct.</p><p>Humana and its lawyers didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</p><p>In October, the judge rejected Mallinckrodt's arguments that its postbankruptcy sales of Acthar couldn't as a matter of law be ongoing violations of U.S. antitrust law or give rise to administrative claims.</p><p>But he left open until Monday the question of whether Mallinckrodt was in fact restraining competition and whether its continuing sales of Acthar entitled Humana and others to administrative priority.</p><p>The judge's decision marks a win for Mallinckrodt and the bondholders poised to take control of the business under its $1.3 billion debt-cutting plan.</p><p>The dispute lay at the intersection between bankruptcy and antitrust law. On one side was Mallinckrodt, which said none of the alleged improper marketing occurred during the bankruptcy and that any liability predating its chapter 11 should be discharged to give it a fresh start.</p><p>On the other was Humana and investment firm Attestor Ltd., which acquired the claims against Mallinckrodt held by other health insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and CVS Health Corp.'s Aetna Inc. They argued that Mallinckrodt was using bankruptcy to immunize itself from liability for ongoing monopoly pricing, forcing them as captive creditors to bear the cost of the company's restructuring efforts.</p><p>The insurers' claims revolved around the development rights for Acthar's synthetic equivalent, Synacthen, which Mallinckrodt acquired when it bought another drugmaker in 2014 and allegedly shelved, blocking the development of a potential competitor to Acthar.</p><p>Mallinckrodt relinquished its rights to develop Synacthen last year, three months before filing bankruptcy, and said that simply charging a high price for Acthar isn't illegal.</p><p>Humana and Attestor disputed that, saying the \"calculated decision\" to continue charging a supracompetitive price is a continuing antitrust violation. In Monday's ruling, Judge Dorsey said they failed to show that another drugmaker would have developed and commercialized a synthetic competitor to Acthar but for Mallinckrodt's actions.</p><p>Mallinckrodt paid $100 million in 2017 to settle, without admitting wrongdoing, Federal Trade Commission allegations that acquiring the Synacthen license had stifled competition.</p><p>Mallinckrodt filed for chapter 11 in large part to address an onslaught of lawsuits over its production and sale of opioids, but it also faced billions of dollars in claims over Acthar.</p><p>The company's bankruptcy-exit plan sets aside $125 million in cash to pay unsecured claims, including those related to Acthar sales from before it filed for chapter 11. The pot could reach between $180 million and $220 million over time if the company can monetize certain drugs under development, according to the official committee of Mallinckrodt's unsecured creditors.</p><p>Humana and other Acthar claimants have said the $7.5 million earmarked for them for isn't enough compared with what other unsecured creditors are getting.</p><p>The chapter 11 plan, which requires Judge Dorsey's approval, would also set aside roughly $1.7 billion to settle claims that Mallinckrodt's opioids contributed to a nationwide addiction crisis. Mallinckrodt was the third drugmaker behind Purdue Pharma LP and Insys Therapeutics Inc. to file bankruptcy to facilitate a settlement of opioid-related claims.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
