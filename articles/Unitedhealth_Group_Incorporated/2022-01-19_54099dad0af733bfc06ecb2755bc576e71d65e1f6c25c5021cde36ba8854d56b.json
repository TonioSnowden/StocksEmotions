  "title": "UnitedHealth Logs Steady Growth Amid Omicron Surge; The healthcare giant's fourth-quarter results get boost from rising premium payments",
  "text": "<p>The Minnetonka, Minn.-based company also reassured investors that its 2022 earnings guidance released in November was intact, including for robust growth in its Medicare Advantage enrollment, a closely watched business for UnitedHealth and the managed-care sector as a whole.</p><p>During a call with analysts on Wednesday, UnitedHealth executives signaled that the Omicron variant is generally causing a less-severe form of Covid-19, echoing findings emerging from other data. The company said inpatient hospitalization levels are similar to what it saw in January 2021, even though cases are at a far higher level. For those who are admitted to hospitals, \"severity is seemingly lower,\" said UnitedHealth Chief Financial Officer John Rex, with shorter stays compared with a year ago.</p><p>As has happened when the virus surges, levels of typical healthcare use dropped off in tandem, UnitedHealth said, with primary-care visits down about 10% in recent weeks and visits to specialists showing a deeper decline. The company said the savings from these reductions is offsetting additional cost from Covid-19 care and testing, which is being boosted by a federal mandate that insurers cover over-the-counter tests.</p><p>UnitedHealth's fourth-quarter profit rose to $4.07 billion, from $2.21 billion in 2020's final period. On a per-share basis after stripping out one-time items, earnings were $4.48, up from $2.52. Wall Street analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $4.30 a share.</p><p>Revenue climbed to $73.74 billion, from $65.47 billion a year before. Most of that growth came from higher premiums, which rose to $57.55 billion, from $50.58 billion in the last quarter of 2020.</p><p>The medical-loss ratio, a closely watched measure of the proportion of premiums going to medical care, was 84%, in line with expectations. At 83%, the full-year ratio was higher in 2021 than in 2020, in part due to rising Covid-19 treatment costs.</p><p>UnitedHealth said it is holding to its 2022 outlook, including for revenue of $317 billion to $320 billion and adjusted earnings of $21.10 a share to $21.60 a share. Both targets represent double-digit annual growth.</p><p>Shares were up slightly Wednesday morning, after closing at $460.99 on Tuesday.</p><p>The company's UnitedHealthcare insurance business saw revenue grow 12% in the fourth quarter to $56.4 billion. The business added 2.2 million members last year, with growth in programs tied to government benefits, such as Medicare Advantage, driving much of the increase.</p><p>UnitedHealth's Optum health-services arm notched 14% growth in the period, with revenue rising to $41.1 billion. Its tally of people served rose to 100 million in 2021, from 98 million a year earlier. The business's revenue per customer was up by a third last year as Optum added more services such as in-home care.</p><p>Prescriptions filled by OptumRx, the company's pharmacy-benefits division, rose 4.4% last year.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com and Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com</p><p>UnitedHealth Logs Steady Growth Amid Omicron Surge</p>",
