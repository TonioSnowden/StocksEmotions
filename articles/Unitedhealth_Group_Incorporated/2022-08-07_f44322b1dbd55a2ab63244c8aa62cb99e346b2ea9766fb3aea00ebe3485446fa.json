  "text": "<p>There is no guarantee any of them will reach a deal for Signify, which has a market value of around $4.7 billion after its shares rose on the news of a potential sale.</p><p>For Woonsocket, R.I.-based CVS, which has a market value of $134 billion, a deal would help fulfill its stated ambition to become an even bigger provider of medical services. The company has indicated it hopes to have a deal in place to help it do so by year-end. Wall Street has largely focused on CVS's efforts to add primary-care practices and doctors to its payroll, though executives have also discussed their ambitions to expand its in-home health presence.</p><p>CVS, parent of the eponymous drugstores and the Aetna health-insurance operation, had eyed a deal for the parent of One Medical, people familiar with the matter said, before Amazon.com Inc. agreed to buy the primary-care clinic operator for about $3.9 billion last month.</p><p>Signify uses analytics and technology to help health plans, employers, physician groups and health systems with in-home care. It also offers in-home health evaluations for Medicare Advantage and other government-run managed-care plans. At the close of its deal this year to buy Caravan Health Inc., Signify said it supported roughly $10 billion in total medical spending.</p><p>Signify went public in February 2021. Even after rallying recently, the shares, which closed Friday at $19.87, are below their $24 IPO price. In July, the company said it planned to wind down one of its units after changes to a government-payment model and focus on more-profitable businesses.</p><p>New York-based private-equity firm New Mountain Capital is an investor in Signify after first backing it in 2017. The firm is well-versed in the sector, having sold healthcare payments firm Equian LLC to UnitedHealth Group Inc. for about $3.2 billion in 2019.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com, Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com and Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>CVS Plans to Bid for Signify Health, Sources Say</p>",
