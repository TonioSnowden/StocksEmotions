  "text": "<p>   In August, Shane Sloan did something he'd never done before. He packed his bags, got on a plane and didn't work for 21 days. </p><p>   \"It was almost disconcerting at first,\" the 43-year-old from Nashville, Tenn., says of the trip to Thailandwith his wife and daughter. He spent time with extended family, hit hotel pools high above Bangkok and relaxed beachside in Phuket. Then he realized he still had a week left. </p><p>   \"Wow, I really have nothing to do,\" he thought to himself. \"It just gives you time to decompress.\" </p><p>   It's a concept foreign to most Americans, the kind of thing people do in Europe, or in fantasies. Three weeks off. In a row. Without having to quit your job. </p><p>   Many of us are currently staring down all those unused vacation days we didn't get a chance to take in 2022, attempting to sneak in some three-day weekends before they evaporate. Most of us are probably failing. Could 2023 be the year we finally take our dream vacations? </p><p>   It's possible, says Tessa White, founder of the Job Doctor, a career-consulting firm in the Salt Lake City area. The key is to anticipate your manager's concerns, come prepared with solutions and make your ask in the right way. </p><p>   \"Anything beyond two weeks is, 'Hang on a minute,'\" from your boss's perspective, says Ms. White, who spent more than two decades in human resources with startups and Fortune 50 companies like UnitedHealth Group. </p><p>   Not everyone even gets three weeks of paid time off per year, or paid time off at all. Even people who get a month or more are at the mercy of their manager's approval. </p><p>   Acknowledge up front that it's a big ask, and be clear about what you want. Try something like, \"I would expect you probably have some concerns about a vacation that long, which is why I wanted to talk in advance about how to make this work well.\" </p><p>   Be strategic about the timing; You don't want to jet when your department is short-staffed, or right when a big project is coming due. Ask at least three months before you want to go. If you're a longtime employee who's racked up significant vacation time -- or if you have unlimited paid time off -- specify you won't be asking for more extended breaks this year, Ms. White says. Promise you'll be the one plugging away when everyone else is out of pocket come school spring break. </p><p>   Once you have your manager's blessing, get it in writing, she adds. With so much corporate flux these days, you want to make sure a new boss or corporate shake-up doesn't repeal the permission. </p><p>   Sure, there will be some negatives. </p><p>   \"Nobody doesn't pay for a three-week vacation,\" Ms. White says. If you really want to disconnect while you're away, you might have to cram in more work in the days before you leave. You will almost certainly be swamped when you get home. If you're good at your job, people will miss you. It will probably still be worth it. </p><p>   \"If you're going to go on a once-in-a-lifetime trip, really go all in,\" says Sanford Berenberg, who spent three weeks in Europe in June. Otherwise, \"what's the point?\" </p><p>   The 55-year-old, who works for insurance broker and benefits firm Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., ate shark in Reykjavik, spotted schools of whales from the deck of a cruise ship in the Norwegian Sea and sent his colleagues' kids candy from Scotland. Even the last five days of his cruise, spent confined to his cabin while his wife tested positive for Covid, felt enjoyable, he says, withtime to nap, meditate, pray, watch movies. </p><p>   Mr. Berenberg, who lives in Kentucky, spent the weeks leading up to his departure making a list of everything he does. He noted the tasks that only he knows how to do and trained colleagues to cover during his absence. </p><p>   Getting your co-workers on board is key to winning approval for an extended break, says Denise Rousseau, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies how workers can impact their organizations. Managers aren't just worried about your projects stalling while you're gone. They are also worried that your teammates will view your time off as unfair. </p><p>   You have a much better chance of persuading your boss to let you take the vacation if you're seen as a team player who is helpful to others, Dr. Rousseau says. </p><p>   Start by approaching your colleagues, telling them you're thinking about requesting time off and asking them how they feel about it. If they seem burdened by the idea, ask what you could do to make it a lighter lift. </p><p>    Weatherly Langsett, a 27-year-old senior consultant for Deloitte, prepared a calendar for her team before her three weeks in South Africa this fall. The document detailed group project work she didn't want to slip through the cracks while she was gone, flagging dates of big meetings, designating who should send follow-up emails and when colleagues should review documents. </p><p>   Doing the prep work let Ms. Langsett swim with sharks and take a safari without having to stress about emergency questions coming to her email inbox. </p><p>   \"I totally disconnected,\" she says. </p><p>   Depressingly, the immediate benefits of time away from work, including decrease in fatigue and an increase in happiness, generally fade within a week, says Jessica de Bloom, an associate professor at the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands. But Dr. de Bloom, who studies recovery from work, believes longer breaks can have a deeper benefit because they build connections between travel partners and give people a bank of positive memories to tap into long after the flight home. </p><p>    Lindsey Newcomb, a single mom in Waterloo, Iowa, saved up her vacation time and money to treat her son to a high-school graduation trip to Italy and Greece this past summer. For their first time in Europe, the pair took a cooking class, relaxed in hot springs and hiked along the coast. Back stateside, refreshed and happy, Ms. Newcomb found she was actually ready to get back to work. </p><p>   \"After being gone that long,\" she says, \"you almost kind of miss it.\" </p><p></p>",
