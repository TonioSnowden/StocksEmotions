  "text": "<p>Just five stocks — Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Apple Inc. AAPL, Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Tesla Inc. TSLA — contributed over a third of the S&amp;P 500 Index's SPX 26% total return for 2021 through Dec. 9, according to analysts at Goldman. And from the end of April through Dec. 9, they contributed 51% of the index's 13% return.</p><p>Moreover, only 25 stocks accounted for 58% of the index's gains, including reinvested dividends, through Dec. 9, Goldman said. Its list of those stocks is below, along with screens of Wall Street analysts' expectations for the group as we look ahead to 2022 and 2023.</p><p>The analysts, led by David Kostin, pointed out that “market breadth has narrowed substantially” over the past several months. In other words, investors have concentrated more of their money (and risk) in the largest tech companies, by market capitalization.</p><p>That said, the Goldman analysts continue to recommend that long-term investors “own high-growth, high-margin stocks.”</p><p>Digging into the 25 biggest contributors to the S&amp;P 500's returns this year</p><p>This list shows each of the 25 stocks and their “contributions” to the gains, expressed in basis points.
