  "text": "<p>A spate of major companies are slated to post quarterly results before the market opens, including UnitedHealth Group, U.S. Bancorp, Bank of America, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. Investors will be looking to see whether stickier-than-expected inflation has impacted earnings and whether companies' outlooks are dimmed by rising energy prices, supply-chain disruptions and anticipated interest rate increases over the next two years.</p><p>\"Can companies weather those risks or was the entire rally only fueled by ultraloose monetary policy?\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research. Investors are looking to see \"where are we in terms of the post-lockdown cycle and also to get some insights into how solid earnings and companies are going into this tapering period and this era of somewhat higher interest rates.\"</p><p>Futures for Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 1% to $83.98 a barrel. Futures for gas to be delivered in the Netherlands—the European benchmark—gained 8.3% to 101.35 euros per megawatt-hour, equivalent to about $117.53.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 1.535% Thursday, from 1.549% Wednesday. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>U.S. jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 9 are forecast to fall for a second consecutive week when figures are released at 8:30 a.m. ET, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.7%. Shares of Paris-based advertising company Publicis Groupe rose 3.4% after it boosted its outlook for 2021 organic revenue growth due to strong demand for digital marketing services in the third quarter.</p><p>Indexes in Asia closed with mixed performance. China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.1%. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 both climbed 1.5%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Major Bank Earnings</p>",
