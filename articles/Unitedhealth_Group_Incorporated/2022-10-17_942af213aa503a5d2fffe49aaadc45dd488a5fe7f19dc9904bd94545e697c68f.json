  "title": "Cybersecurity Tops the CIO Agenda as Threats Continue to Escalate; 'If I get a budget challenge, it doesn't come out of cyber,' says Lesley Salmon, global chief information officer of Kellogg",
  "text": "<p>Corporate CIOs have a role in a range of crucial business initiatives, from the adoption of cloud computing to the use of advanced data analytics and the modernization of productivity, collaboration and commerce platforms that touch on customer and employee experience. Cyber and information security has been at the top of their agenda since 2020.</p><p>\"You boil it down to the CIO, it is cybersecurity. Absolutelyâ€¦That is the highest priority,\" said Chris Howard, chief of research at technology research and consulting firm Gartner Inc., pointing to the results of the firm's latest CIO Survey. The results of the annual CIO survey, which included about 2,200 respondents, were announced Monday at the 2022 Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo, under way this week in Orlando, Fla.</p><p>In the study, in which Gartner asked CIOs whether they planned to increase or decrease their investments in a range of areas, 66% of respondents said they planned to increase investment in cybersecurity.</p><p>By that measure, it was the top investment priority for CIOs, beating business intelligence and analytics, in which 55% of respondents said they planned to increase investment. Other investment priorities included cloud computing platforms, application modernization and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Gartner forecasts that worldwide information security and risk-management spending by end-users will reach $188.336 billion in 2023, up 11.3% from the current year. Gartner estimates that spending on security will grow 7.2% this year compared with 2021. The company says spending on security grew 14.3% in 2021 compared with 2020.</p><p>At packaged-food manufacturer Kellogg Co. safety and security account for roughly 15% of its total corporate information and technology spend, according to global CIO Lesley Salmon.</p><p>\"From an expense perspective, not a capital investment perspective, it will be going up proportionately more than any of my other areas next year,\" said Ms. Salmon, who is based in the U.K.</p><p>Moreover, should the need to cut expenses arise, Ms. Salmon said she leaves that part of the budget intact.</p><p>\"I don't ever go to that hunting ground to save money. If I get a budget challenge, it doesn't come out of cyber,\" said Ms. Salmon, who joined the company in 2014 and has been in her current role since March 2019. She reports to Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane.</p><p>Ms. Salmon has spent the last 12 months or so building up the company's use of the Amazon Web Services cloud and its use of analytics and AI. \"But the constant across all of that is cyber,\" she said.</p><p>Her strategy has been to bolster security at the perimeter of the network and work inward from there. The company also is working to adopt a so-called Zero Trust framework for cybersecurity, in which users and applications must continually reauthenticate themselves.</p><p>The company's chief information security officer reports to her, but she said that cybersecurity is a partnership that includes many roles throughout the company.</p><p>The collaborative emphasis on cybersecurity is evident across companies in healthcare and financial services where executives in a range of roles, technical and nontechnical alike, are now on the front lines of securing networks and data.</p><p>\"We are mutually concerned about cybersecurity. It's what boards are talking about,\" said Truist Financial Corp. Chief Information Security Officer Howard Whyte. He and Truist CIO Scott Case work closely to understand the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's changing attack surface and cybersecurity risk. In particular, they are updating digital capabilities while monitoring the integration of technology at the bank, which resulted from BB&amp;T Corp.'s $28.2 billion acquisition of SunTrust Banks Inc. in 2019.</p><p>Companies are in the midst of a long-term effort to develop more effective conceptual approaches to cybersecurity, according to Michael Levin, senior vice president for global cyber risk and defense at UnitedHealth Group, the managed healthcare and insurance company based in Minnetonka, Minn.</p><p>In healthcare, the 2015 medical data breach of Anthem Inc., now known as Elevance Health, was a turning point, Mr. Levin said.</p><p>There has been a movement away from a compliance-only approach to cybersecurity, based on a checklist of what companies need to do, said Mr. Levin, a former director of security design and innovation for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Now, he said, more forward-looking companies are adopting a newer risk- and outcomes-based approach. Yet, there is much more work to be done as companies figure out how to best cope with a constantly shifting landscape of cyber threats.</p><p>\"A lot of organizations are still focused on those earlier checklists and compliance. I did all the things you told me to, so I am safe, versus considering how can I be safe,\" he said.</p><p>Kim S.
