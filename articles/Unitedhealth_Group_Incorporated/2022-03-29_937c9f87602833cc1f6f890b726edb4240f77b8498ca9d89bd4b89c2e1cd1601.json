Both sides described the negotiations as constructive, though no immediate breakthroughs were produced, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>Russia's military also said Tuesday it would “fundamentally” cut back operations near Ukraine's capital and a northern city, potentially a significant concession by Moscow since it invaded its neighbor more than a month ago.</p><p>“A sense of positivity returned to financial markets as the prospects of more cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine soothed investor jitters,” said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM.</p><p>See also:War in Ukraine: New round of talks in Istanbul aims to stop the fighting</p><p>The dollar USDRUB plunged against the ruble, and oil prices CL.1 dropped, as reports began to emerge after the day's meetings in Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>Although oil prices remain elevated, their decline from even higher levels has taken “a little of the pressure off inflation,” said Putnam's Perkins.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to rise to 107.5.</p><p>Employment trends could be partly behind the improved sentiment, according to Perkins. “The labor market is very strong,” he said. “We know that people are changing jobs, presumably to get raises.”</p><p>Data on job openings and labor turnover showed the quitting rate rose to 2.9% in February, from 2.8% in January, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p><p>Read:Another 4.35 million U.S. workers quit — most for better jobs</p><p>In other economic data released Tuesday, the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city house price index posted a 19.1% year-over-year gain in January, up slightly from 18.6% the previous month.</p><p>An uptick in 30-year mortgage rates should help cool the hot housing market, according to&#xa0; Perkins. He said some slowing in home-price growth would be “well received” by the equity market as it would take some pressure off “the inflation picture” broadly worrying investors.</p><p>“As the Fed embarks on what appears likely to be an extended rate hike cycle and financial conditions tighten, consumers are increasingly wary of the outlook for the economy in the latter half of the year and into 2023,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in emailed comments.</p><p>“Can policy makers thread the needle to cool the economy and bring inflation pressures down to a more palatable level without choking off growth? That's the challenge before the Fed and a tall order for policy makers who will attempt to navigate the economy to a soft landing,” he wrote.</p><p>Another major development for the world economy was in China, as a two-phased lockdown of the financial capital Shanghai entered the second day raising the prospect of more supply chain disruptions hitting the world economy.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>FedEx Corp.FDX founder Fred Smith late Monday announced plans to step down from the chief executive role, and will be replaced by the logistics company's president and chief operating officer.
