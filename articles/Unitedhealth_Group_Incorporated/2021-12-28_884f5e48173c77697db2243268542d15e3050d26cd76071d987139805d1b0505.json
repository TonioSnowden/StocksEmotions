  "text": "<p>How are stock indexes trading?</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX slipped almost 7 points, or 0.1%, to 4,784 after setting an intraday record at 4,807.02. The index was heading for its 70th record close of 2021.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 78 points, or 0.2%, to 36,380, buoyed by gains in UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Boeing Co.

Meanwhile, holiday-shopping sales looked “pretty good,” giving the stock market some momentum in the final stretch of 2021.</p><p>On Monday, the market set off on its best so-called Santa Rally, which tends to show up for U.S. stocks in the final week of December and first two trading sessions of January, in about two decades.</p><p>“It seems that last week's reports confirming that the omicron coronavirus variant is not as deadly as prior strains, kept market participants willing to increase their exposure this week as well,” said Charalambos Pissouros, head of research at JFD Group.</p><p>While the omicron variant spreads around the globe, particularly wreaking havoc on holiday travel due to rising cases among airline staff in particular, investors have taken heart from news Monday that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xa0;cut its recommended COVID-19 isolation time to five days, from 10, if affected individuals are symptom-free.</p><p>Still, Apple AAPL said it would temporarily close 11 New York City stores as a precaution against rising cases. And major cities around the world, including New York City, are paring down New Year's Eve celebrations as a way of combating the virus' spread. Apple's shares were down 0.5% Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Read:Big Tech heads for ‘a year of thousands of tiny tech papercuts,' but what antitrust efforts could make them bleed?</p><p>In a light week for U.S. economic data, the&#xa0;S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city price index&#xa0;posted an 18.4% year-over-year gain in October, down from 19.1% the previous month. That measure of U.S. home prices, released Tuesday, marked the third consecutive month showing annual appreciation occurred at a slower pace.</p><p>“It's good for the housing market if price appreciation slows because then more people can afford housing,” said Wren. “First-time home buyers are having a tough time affording these prices.”&#xa0;</p><p>Meanwhile,&#xa0;China Evergrande GroupHK:3333EGRNF, the heavily indebted real-estate developer, said on Tuesday that&#xa0;construction work had resumed&#xa0;at more than 90% of its stalled residential projects.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Digital Turbine Inc.&#xa0;APPS&#xa0;were down 2% Tuesday afternoon, after the media and mobile communications company announced a multiyear partnership with Alphabet Inc.'s&#xa0;GOOGLGOOGGoogle.</p><p>Shares of Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Ltd.&#xa0;KNSA&#xa0;were off 2% Tuesday, after the biopharmaceutical company said a Phase 3 trial of mavrilimumab for treatment of COVID-19-related acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint.</p><p>Mercury Systems Inc.&#xa0;MRCY&#xa0;said Tuesday that it has adopted a one-year shareholder rights plan, also known as a “poison pill,” as protection from a hostile takeover during a period in which the aerospace and defense technologies company believes its stock is undervalued. Its stock was up 0.8%.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y slipped 1 basis point to around 1.47%.
