  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Amazon Faces Test in Health Push --- Primary-care deal is unlike move into advertising, grocery and entertainment",
  "text": "<p>Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy and other executives have declared their intent to disrupt healthcare. But the industry is in some ways more complex and diffuse than other areas into which Amazon has grown recently, such as entertainment, advertising or grocery businesses. Success will require beating entrenched rivals with long experience navigating industry regulations and competing for physicians who are key to growth.</p><p>The company's earlier forays into healthcare haven't met with as much success as some predicted, including a $1 billion deal for a business to ship prescriptions nationwide and the high-profile venture to remake healthcare that companies offer to U.S. workers.</p><p>While Amazon often causes strong market reactions when it enters or expands greatly into new markets, the company has several times failed to meet lofty expectations.</p><p>Some Amazon observers liken the potential of the One Medical deal to that of Amazon's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market in 2017, which has brought the company some success but hasn't come close to the dominant position some analysts predicted when the deal was struck.</p><p>Five years later, Amazon has expanded its grocery services to include its Amazon Fresh line, which has featured the company's cashier-free technology, dubbed \"Just Walk Out.\" It has also added new Whole Foods stores and had limited expansion with much smaller convenience stores. But the company hasn't found much financial success yet. Its physical stores sales last year increased by 5% to about $17 billion.</p><p>\"The difference here is you have to source great doctors, not just groceries,\" Hal Reynolds, chief investment officer at Amazon investor Los Angeles Capital Management LLC, said of the One Medical purchase.</p><p>Acquiring One Medical will pit Amazon against other formidable companies seeking to snap up primary-care doctors, including UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s Optum health-services arm and CVS Health Corp., and hospital systems that increasingly employ physicians.</p><p>Primary-care doctors are considered critical by health policy and employer groups to curbing rising healthcare costs. The doctors are often the first to see and diagnose patients and are widely considered important to helping prevent and manage chronic illness to avoid dangerous and costly complications. \"Primary care is really a key entry point into the healthcare delivery system,\" said Emma Hoo, director of value-based purchasing for the Purchaser Business Group on Health, which represents private and public employers and health-insurance exchanges across the U.S. \"It's about the total quality of care and the total cost of care.\"</p><p>Amazon in 2019 launched Amazon Care, a telehealth service it first offered to its employees before announcing last year it would expand the offering to other companies.</p><p>Some of Amazon's rivals have a significant head start in primary care. UnitedHealth Group owns the biggest U.S. health insurer, with built-in relationships with employers and deep wells of healthcare data.</p><p>Its Optum arm has been acquiring clinics, physician groups and surgery centers for many years, so it has stitched together a sprawling network. The company has said it had around 60,000 doctors employed or affiliated with Optum at the end of last year, and aims to add thousands more in 2022.</p><p>Pharmacy companies are another key competitor for Amazon's primary-care efforts, and they can build on a national bricks-and-mortar presence. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. last year agreed to acquire a controlling stake in primary-care network VillageMD and said it would add hundreds of locations in the next few years.</p><p>CVS Health has been upgrading stores to become centers providing more healthcare services. It aims to create physician-staffed primary-care practices, which it has said is a focus in its acquisition strategy. CVS is also the parent of Aetna, a major national insurer.</p><p>Some Amazon analysts welcomed the news of the deal ahead of what is expected to be tepid earnings from the company next week. \"Healthcare is a massive total addressable market and if Amazon is able to exploit this opportunity, it could move the needle on sales and profits,\" analyst Tom Forte from D.A. Davidson wrote in a research note.</p><p>---</p><p>Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article.</p>",
