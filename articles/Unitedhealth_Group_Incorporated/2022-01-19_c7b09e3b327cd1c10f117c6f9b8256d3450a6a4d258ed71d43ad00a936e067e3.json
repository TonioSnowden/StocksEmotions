There are a lot of changes in investors' thinking that needs to happen, and those typically take time.”</p><p>While Peron said he's “constructive on the long term” for stocks, he also expects the next three to six months to be choppy as the Fed looks to rein in easy monetary conditions unleashed during the pandemic.</p><p>Surging Treasury yields have weighed on the market's bullishness, particularly hitting yield-sensitive technology and other growth equities hard.

Federated Hermes' Philip Orlando expects four rate hikes this year, starting in March, each in 25-basis-point increases, even through others have begun calling for a series of 50-basis-point hikes to help “get the inflation genie back in the bottle.”</p><p>“I don't think they will be that aggressive,” the chief equity-market strategist told MarketWatch. “But the reality is we just don't know. I think that's going to create a lot of volatility and uncertainty in the markets right now.”</p><p>In U.S. economic reports, home builders started construction on homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of roughly 1.7 million in December, representing a 1% increase from the previous month, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
