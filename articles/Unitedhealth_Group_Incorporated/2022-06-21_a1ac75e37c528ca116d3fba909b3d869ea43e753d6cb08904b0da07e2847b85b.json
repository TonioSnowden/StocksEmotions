  "title": "TPG Capital Pivots to Take Convey Health Private; The TPG-controlled health payments technology provider that focuses on government-sponsored health plans went public a year ago",
  "text": "<p>The offer represents more than twice the stock's closing price of $4.32 a share on Friday, the trading day before the going-private deal was disclosed. Convey Chief Executive Stephen Farrell in a securities filing said it \"provides substantial value\" and certainty to investors. A special committee of the company's independent directors evaluated the TPG proposal and recommended approval, the filing indicated.</p><p>Convey's full board and TPG have approved the deal, which is expected to close before the end of the year. No additional shareholder votes are required, according to Convey.</p><p>Mr. Farrell said after going private the company would continue to invest in itself with TPG's support.</p><p>Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Convey works primarily with Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D health insurance plans, handling functions from eligibility and enrollment to premium payment processing. Its two largest clients in 2021 were Cigna Corp. and UnitedHealth Group Inc., according to a securities filing.</p><p>The deal is the second take-private transaction by TPG in as many months, as the firm joined with Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice to offer $21 a share to buy money-losing pet-care company Covetrus Inc. last month.</p><p>Convey's stock has languished since its IPO, which priced at $14 a share. But it recovered some value on Tuesday, closing at $10.30 a share.</p><p>In March, Convey reported a wider annual loss of about $10 million, or 15 cents a share, for 2021 compared with a loss of about $6.5 million, or 11 cents a share, in 2020, while revenue rose 19% to $337.6 million in 2021 from $282.9 million in the previous year. The company said in May that revenue rose 17% to $96.7 million in this year's first quarter, but its loss widened to almost $1.2 million and adjusted pretax earnings declined 3% to $15.3 million for the period.</p><p>Convey was founded in 2001 and had earlier traded publicly as NationsHealth Inc. TPG Capital bought the company from New Mountain Capital in 2019. New Mountain acquired the business in 2016.</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p>",
