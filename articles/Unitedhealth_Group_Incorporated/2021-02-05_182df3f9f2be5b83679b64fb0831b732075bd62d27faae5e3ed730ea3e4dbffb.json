  "title": "UnitedHealth Chief Abruptly Exits  ----  By Anna Wilde Mathews",
  "text": "<p>   UnitedHealth Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Wichmann retired after 40 months in the role and was succeeded by Andrew Witty, the company's president, an abrupt move that came as a surprise to company executives and investors. </p><p>   Mr. Wichmann was succeeded by Andrew Witty, the company's president. Mr. Witty, the 56-year-old former CEO of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC, became the chief executive of UnitedHealth's Optum health-services unit in 2018, and added the president title in November 2019. He recently returned from a leave of absence to work on Covid-19 efforts at the World Health Organization. </p><p>   Mr. Wichmann, 59, who became CEO in September 2017, will work in a transition role through March. He joined UnitedHealth in 1998, and had been president before assuming the chief executive role. </p><p>   UnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka, Minn., is the parent of the biggest U.S. health insurer, with 2020 revenue topping $250 billion. In addition to its insurance business, the company has Optum, which includes data analysis, a pharmacy-benefit manager and a sprawling network of doctor groups and surgery centers. </p><p>   The shift came after Mr. Witty signaled to the board that he was considering leaving, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Witty, who served on the UnitedHealth board before joining the company as an executive, is well-regarded by the board, which didn't want to lose him, according to these people. </p><p>   Mr. Wichmann stepped down voluntarily, these people said. </p><p>   \"With Dave's retirement, the board saw Andrew as the outstanding choice,\" said a UnitedHealth spokesman. </p><p>   The experience of living through the pandemic had underscored to Mr. Wichmann the importance of time with family, the spokesman said, and he decided to leave at a moment when the company was doing well. The spokesman said Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Witty declined to comment. </p><p>   In a note sent Thursday to UnitedHealth employees, Mr. Wichmann said it was \"bittersweet\" to announce his departure. He wrote that the move \"is the right decision for me and my family.\" Mr. Wichmann was in the office on Thursday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. </p><p>   The sudden switch is particularly unexpected in a company that has demonstrated a deliberative leadership transition process at the top. UnitedHealth's shares have gone up more than 60% under his tenure, and he has been well-regarded by investors. </p><p>   Internally, the move was also seen as surprising, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Last week, Mr. Wichmann led an annual meeting of the company's top leaders, with hundreds of executives gathering virtually. During one session, Mr. Wichmann, in speaking about leadership and the need to strive for improvement, made a reference to himself getting feedback that he found challenging, these people said. </p><p>   However, the people said, there was no sign that Mr. Wichmann was planning an exit, as he spoke optimistically about the company's direction. </p><p>   Mr. Wichmann, a former CFO as well as leader of UnitedHealth's insurance unit, had long been positioned as the successor to Stephen J. Hemsley, now UnitedHealth's board chairman, who was the company's CEO for more than a decade. Mr. Wichmann had been seen as close to Mr. Hemsley. </p><p>   The move came within weeks of the release of earnings that were seen as solid, and UnitedHealth shares were down 2.5% Thursday. UnitedHealth said it wasn't changing its earnings guidance for 2021, or its long-term financial growth targets. </p><p>   \"Everything looks on track\" with company performance, said Matthew Borsch, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. </p><p></p>",
