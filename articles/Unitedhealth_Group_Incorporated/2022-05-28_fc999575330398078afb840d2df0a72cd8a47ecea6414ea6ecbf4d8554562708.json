  "text": "<p>\n  The First Populist: The Defiant Life of Andrew Jackson </p><p>\n  By David S. Brown </p><p>\n  Scribner, 417 pages, $30 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump hung his portrait in the Oval Office. So did Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton. Steve Bannon admires him extravagantly, though no more than Harry Truman did. \"The more I learn about Andy Jackson, the more I love him,\" Franklin Roosevelt declared on the eve of his 1936 re-election campaign against \"economic royalists,\" successors to the monopolistic Second Bank of the United States demonized by Jackson a century earlier. FDR then used the occasion of that year's Jackson Day Dinner to extol Old Hickory's \"passion for justice, his championship of the cause of the exploited and the downtrodden, his ardent and flaming patriotism.\" </p><p>\n  Such praise may seem strange in the ears of readers of most latter-day accounts of America's seventh president (1829-37). Today's scholars, attuned to a more diverse population than the white, male electorate that twice voted him into office, are more likely to stigmatize Jackson as a slave trader, Indian killer and economic illiterate. Yet even as he is airbrushed out of the history of the Democratic Party that he essentially founded, Jackson remains among our most consequential presidents. Long before either Roosevelt, he introduced the anti-elitist politics of \"Us versus Them,\" encapsulated in his July 1832 veto killing the government-backed bank answering to Philadelphia blue blood Nicholas Biddle. </p><p>\n  Exposing the young republic's economic fault lines, Jackson railed against the \"rich and powerful\" who \"too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes\" at the expense of the \"farmers, mechanics, and laborers.\" Such language, and the aggressive party-building behind it, fully justify biographer David S. Brown's characterization of Jackson as \"the First Populist.\" Mr. Brown, a history professor at Pennsylvania's Elizabethtown College, is the author of well-regarded lives of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Henry Adams. His Jackson is a compound, not always stable, of opposing instincts. </p><p>\n  A small-government advocate, Jackson was the last president to vanquish the national debt. Away from Washington, however, official frugality yielded to private luxury at the Hermitage, a Tennessee mansion made possible by slave labor (Jackson died owing nearly a million dollars, by modern measurement). A fervent nationalist who threatened to hang South Carolina's \"treasonous\" nullifiers, Jackson was also a strict constructionist whose Jeffersonian scruples made him veto federally funded infrastructure projects. </p><p>\n  The early Jackson biographer James Parton, unable to square the circle, settled for \"a democratic autocrat. An urbane savage. An atrocious saint.\" Mr. Brown accepts Jackson's discrepancies and contradictions, along with Old Hickory's precipitous decline in recent academic polls. (With his startling 22nd-place rank in last year's C-Span survey of presidential scholars, Jackson finished behind John Quincy Adams for the first time in 196 years.) Avoiding the pitfalls of ex post facto history, Mr. Brown offers instead what amounts to a unified field theory for Jacksonian studies: the Authoritarian at War with Authority. </p><p>\n  From boyhood Jackson went through life spoiling for a fight, his hunger for status matching his need for control. The author traces Jacksonian bravado to a fatherless youth -- Andrew Jackson Sr. died weeks before his son's birth in March 1767 -- imbued with a burning hatred of the British invaders he blamed for the wartime deaths of his mother and brother. The future president carried lifelong scars inflicted by the sword of an imperious Redcoat whose boots the boy refused to clean. His psychic wounds can only be imagined. </p><p>\n  Accordingly much of Mr. Brown's briskly paced narrative reads like a rap sheet of rashly provoked duels, threatened horse whippings and barroom shootings. In one affaire d'honneur Jackson took a bullet to his chest before calmly dispatching Charles Dickinson, a rival horse breeder who had insulted Rachel Jackson, the common-law wife with whom Jackson had eloped in 1791, two years before her divorce from an abusive first husband. He would have plugged his adversary, a bleeding Jackson allowed, \"if he had shot me through the brain.\" </p><p>\n  Jackson, after a youthful career in Tennessee law and politics, achieved national recognition as a hero of the Creek War (1813-14), the opening wedge of an Indian-removal policy that long predated his presidency. Trading atrocities with the Red Stick tribe in modern-day Alabama, Georgia and Florida, Jackson, then the major general of his home state's militia, assured Rachel after one particularly gruesome massacre that the butchery had been carried out \"in elegant stile.\" Out of its wreckage Jackson adopted an orphaned Creek child named Lyncoya. He hoped to enroll the boy one day in the U.S. military academy at West Point. Instead Lyncoya ran away from his new home several times before succumbing to tuberculosis in his teens. </p><p>\n  An equally lethal paternalism characterized the Treaty of Fort Jackson, signed in August 1814. Under its terms not only the Red Stick enemy but tribes friendly to the United States were forced to cede 23 million acres, thereby opening the Southwest to a cotton-growing culture as dependent on enslaved people as Jackson's Hermitage. When informed that his land-grabbing pact violated the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812, Jackson disregarded Washington's instructions like some antebellum Douglas MacArthur. </p><p>\n  He had little to fear, being politically untouchable, especially after Jan. 8, 1815, when his ragtag force of U.S. regulars, local and Kentucky militia, Choctaw Indians and two battalions of free blacks inflicted a crushing defeat on a much larger British army just five miles from New Orleans's French Quarter. (In the popular imagination of his time, Jackson had decisively ended the War of 1812: The Hero of New Orleans, Mr. Brown writes, \"defeated the nation's greatest enemies, preserved . . . its intense pride, and secured the reputation of republican government in the New World.\") The battle won, Jackson refused to relax martial law in the combustible city. \"Never one to be in the wrong and ever sensitive to a slight,\" writes Mr. Brown, the general arrested a protesting lawmaker and the federal judge who granted the prisoner a writ of habeas corpus. </p><p>\n  Jackson's unauthorized invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818 met with popular approval while setting off alarms among prospective political rivals. House Speaker Henry Clay likened Old Hickory to Caesar, Cromwell and Bonaparte. The increasing polarization of the electorate is neatly captured in a few lines of newspaper doggerel anticipating the bitter 1824 presidential contest that would ultimately be decided by the House of Representatives: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  John Quincy Adams, </p><p>\n  Who can write, </p><p>\n  And Andrew Jackson, </p><p>\n  Who can fight. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Mr. Brown largely exonerates the victorious Adams of charges that in a \"corrupt bargain\" he traded the State Department for Clay's support. Though not personally close, the two men shared a Hamiltonian faith in energetic, commercially minded government, in sharp contrast to the agrarian states' rights sympathies espoused by Jackson. </p><p>\n  Four years later the Jackson-Adams rematch reached levels of personal abuse that would have made the Founders blush. The incumbent was accused of having, when ambassador to Russia during the Madison administration, pimped for the czar. Not to be outdone, pro-Adams newspapers vilified Jackson as a bigamist descended from a mulatto father and a common prostitute. This time around, Jackson won nearly 56% of the popular vote and, in the Electoral College, carried 15 states to Adams's 9. </p><p>\n  Whatever satisfaction Jackson derived from his landslide in November 1828 turned to ashes a few days before Christmas, when Rachel died of a heart attack, \"a collateral casualty of her husband's career.\" As the grieving widower took office with blood in his eye, a misplaced gallantry fueled by memories of his slandered womenfolk prompted Jackson's defense of Peggy Eaton, a Washington tavernkeeper's daughter who wasted no time, following her husband's suicide, in remarrying Jackson's secretary of war, John Eaton. When the wives of other Cabinet officers, following the example of Vice President John C. Calhoun's censorious spouse, Floride, ostracized the Eatons, the ensuing melodrama came close to wrecking the new administration. </p><p>\n  This absurd burlesque dragged on for two years, until Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, eager to drive a wedge between Jackson and his vice president, offered to resign his post. Van Buren's action cleared the way for a Cabinet makeover, the first of several as Jackson employed five Treasury secretaries and four secretaries of state during his two terms. So much for rotation in office, dubbed the spoils system by Jackson's critics then and since. </p><p>\n  By the time the cunning Van Buren replaced Calhoun on the 1832 Democratic ticket, Jackson had long since put the Eaton affair behind him. The Indian Removal Act, passed in May 1830, initiated the forced relocation of 60,000 Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi. Giving Jackson the benefit of the doubt, Mr. Brown contends that the Trail of Tears happened when it did mostly because Jackson was the first American president with the military capacity to make it happen. </p><p></p>",
