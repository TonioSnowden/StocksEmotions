At a Goldman Sachs Healthcare CEOs conference, Broussard said the lowered outlook was a retention issue, not a sales issue, which he blamed on competition and “changes and the evolution of the distribution structure within the industry.”</p><p>Don't miss: Humana's stock keeps falling amid fears that Medicare Advantage problems will last into next year.</p><p>UnitedHealth Chief Executive Andrew Witty answered Stephens' Fidel by saying, “the number of folks who have chosen UnitedHealthcare continues to grow super well, ahead of market, growing market share once again,” according to a FactSet transcript, and adding that the outlook was “super positive” and that nothing has changed in terms of distribution.</p><p>Tim Noel, CEO of UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement, followed up by saying the MA market has been “highly competitive for a number of years,” and he doesn't see and in that competitiveness in 2022.</p><p>“The trend of more entrants, better benefits has really been a multiyear one,” Noel said. “And we see this as being one that's very good for seniors and also one that's very good for the overall growth of the Medicare Advantage industry.”</p><p>“Seniors are shopping for more value as they should be,” Noel added. “And for out part, we're really focused on differentiating our offerings in the marketplace.”</p><p>UnitedHealth shares have lost 5.5% since Humana warned about its MA problems, while Humana's stock has tumbled 16.0%.
