  "text": "<p>   The average cost of employer health coverage for a family this year is about $22,000, a figure similar to last year's total, according to a new survey that shows upward pressure on healthcare costs hasn't yet broadly translated into higher premiums. </p><p>   That will likely change next year, as insurers renegotiate contracts with hospitals and other medical providers that are seeking higher reimbursements to cover their own rising expenses for labor and other supplies. </p><p>    UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Elevance Health Inc., parents of large health insurers, said on earnings calls earlier this month that they were seeing inflationary trends and taking steps to price coverage accordingly. </p><p>   Premiums for many individual and small-business plans are also expected to rise sharply next year. </p><p>   For 2022, annual premiums for an employer-provided family plan were $22,463, which wasn't a statistically significant change from $22,221 last year, according to an annual survey of employers by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. </p><p>   Employees paid $6,106 of the total this year, with the rest of the cost borne by the employers, according to the Kaiser survey. The amount of the employee contribution was $5,969 in 2021. </p><p>   The average cost of an employer health plan for an individual for 2022 was $7,911, compared with $7,739 last year. </p><p>   The Kaiser survey found that employers, grappling with a tight labor market in many fields but relatively steady premiums, held off on significantly raising deductibles. </p><p>   The survey was conducted between February and July 2022 and drew responses from 2,188 employers. </p><p></p>",
