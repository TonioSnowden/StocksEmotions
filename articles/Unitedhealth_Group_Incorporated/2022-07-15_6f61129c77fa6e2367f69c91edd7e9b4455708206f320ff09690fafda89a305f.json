  "title": "Dow Rises Nearly 600 Points on Retail Spending Data; American shoppers lifted their spending in June amid high inflation and economic uncertainty",
  "text": "<p>Investors are trying to assess how officials will balance the need to tame inflation with concerns over a potential recession. U.S. consumer inflation accelerated to 9.1% in June, a pace not seen in more than four decades, causing some traders to expect that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively to tame it. At the same time, tightening of financial conditions could weigh on growth.</p><p>More than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity is tied to household spending. Recessions typically are accompanied by a pullback by consumers. The Commerce Department reported that Americans' retail spending rose 1% in June from the prior month, after declining in May.</p><p>\"You don't get a recession by adding 6 million jobs or having consumer spending that isn't shrinking,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. \"A lot of the retail report was just inflation. But on the other hand, sales are not going down, either. This doesn't say 'recession.'\"</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment leveled off in early July, staying at subdued levels amid concerns over inflation and a coming economic recession. The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan increased to 51.1 in July from 50.0 in June, hovering near its all-time low.</p><p>\"Recession risks have risen since the beginning of the year,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"If we don't get any signal of consumer retrenchment, maybe it's not as bad as people fear, but if we do get that it's a signal recession risk is materializing.\"</p><p>Some of the largest U.S. financial companies reported earnings ahead of the market open. BlackRock shares edged up 0.8% after its second-quarter profit fell 22% amid a bruising market downturn. Wells Fargo shares added 6.2% after its second-quarter profit declined 48%. Citigroup shares rose 10% after it posted better-than-expected profit and revenue. U.S. Bancorp gained 5.1%, while Bank of America rose 5%.</p><p>As a group, financial stocks paced the S&amp;P 500's gains. By late-morning trading, financial, communications and healthcare shares had each climbed more than 2%.</p><p>Shares of Pinterest jumped nearly 15% after The Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Elliott Management has taken a big stake in the social-media company. Vonage Holdings shares rose 6.7% after Swedish telecom-equipment giant Ericsson said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. had authorized its $6.2 billion proposal to buy Vonage.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group shares added 5.4% after the company raised its outlook for the second consecutive quarter and posted higher revenue and profit for the recently ended period.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.912% from 2.957% Thursday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 2.7% to $101.76 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.8%, though the index is poised to close out the week with losses. Italian political turmoil and worries that the Kremlin will end supplies to the Nord Stream pipeline that channels Russian natural gas to Europe have added to recession fears for the continent.</p><p>In Asia, China's Shanghai Composite fell 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 2.2%. China recorded its weakest growth rate in more than two years, a measure of the costs imposed on the world's second-largest economy by Beijing's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19.</p><p>South Korea's Kospi added 0.4%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Rises Nearly 600 Points on Retail Spending Data</p>",
