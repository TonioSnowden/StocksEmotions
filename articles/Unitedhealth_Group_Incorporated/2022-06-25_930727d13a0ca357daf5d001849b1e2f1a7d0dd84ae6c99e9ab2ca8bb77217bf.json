  "title": "Roe v. Wade Overturned:  Companies Weigh Expanding Benefits  ----  By Anna Wilde Mathews, Kathryn Dill, Emily Glazer and Chip Cutter",
  "text": "<p>   The Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade creates new challenges for employers and health insurers covering abortion services, especially whether and how to pay for travel to states where the procedure remains available. </p><p>   Companies including Starbucks Corp., Uber Technologies Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have said they would reimburse travel for medical services including abortion. Just Eat Takeaway.com NV's Grubhub and Dick's Sporting Goods said they would provide up to $4,000 to cover expenses traveling for services not available in their home state. </p><p>   \"We recognize people feel passionately about this topic -- and that there are teammates and athletes who will not agree with this decision,\" Dick's Chief Executive Officer Lauren Hobart wrote in an email to employees. </p><p>   Thorny benefits issues pose a fresh challenge for many companies already struggling to navigate divisive social and political issues. </p><p>   Companies that choose to cover abortion -- and any travel necessary to get one -- have to balance alienating employees agitating for their employers to take a stand versus the risk of legal attacks or political blowback in states that have banned the procedure. </p><p>   \"Benefits are suddenly starting to become very political, and it's forcing employers to take a position,\" said Michael Turpin, executive vice president at USI Holdings Corp., an insurance brokerage. </p><p>   There are also questions of how much employers, especially smaller ones, can afford to invest, according to human-resources executives, CEOs and insurance experts. </p><p>   On Friday, some executives quickly issued public statements regarding the Supreme Court's decision. Yelp Inc. CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, who has been vocal on reproductive rights, said in a statement that business leaders needed to speak out against a wave of abortion bans expected to be triggered by the decision. </p><p>   Julie Jones, chair of law firm Ropes &amp; Gray, sent a memo to employees saying it would hold gatherings over the next few days to speak about the decision and give an overview of federal and state law on reproductive rights. </p><p>   The firm's lawyers are also in touch with its pro bono group to work on related cases, according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   \"As a woman, I have a profound feeling of vulnerability caused by the elimination of a longstanding right of women -- a right that affects their bodies and their agency,\" she wrote. Ropes &amp; Gray has about 1,400 lawyers across the world. </p><p>   Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg called the Supreme Court decision \"a huge setback.\" A Meta spokesman said the company plans to offer travel-expense reimbursements to access out-of-state healthcare and reproductive services, and is \"in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved.\" </p><p>   Without health insurance to foot the bill, obtaining an abortion can be costly. In the U.S., the median self-pay price for a medication abortion in 2020 was $560, and the median cost of a first-trimester procedural abortion was $575, according to a study published in April in the journal Health Affairs. </p><p>   Many employers, especially the largest national companies, have been covering the procedures. Some 10% of American workers are enrolled in plans offered by employers that specifically excluded or tightly restricted it, according to a 2019 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p><p>   As it became clear that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe, many other businesses have been working behind the scenes to have a response ready to roll out when the court acted, according to benefits consultants. </p><p>   Some 14% of large employers surveyed beginning in early June said they had a travel benefit in place, while another 25% said they were considering it, according to responses from nearly 300 employers to a survey being conducted by benefits consultant Mercer LLC. </p><p>   Employers with at least 20,000 workers were the most likely to provide a travel and lodging benefit for employees traveling to receive an abortion, the survey said. </p><p>   Major insurers that administer health benefits for big employers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s UnitedHealthcare, Cigna Corp. and CVS Health Corp.'s Aetna, had been confirming to self-insured clients they can likely facilitate travel offerings, benefits consultants say. </p><p>   Cigna and CVS said they are looking to support the coverage needs of their clients and customers. UnitedHealth Group said it remains committed to helping members and patients get access to their benefits and services. </p><p>   Draft language that UnitedHealthcare recently sent to an employer for potential use in its plan document describing covered benefits, which was viewed by the Journal, said the health plan would cover travel and lodging to a nearby state to get a covered healthcare service that isn't legally available where the employee lives. </p><p>   Many employers have been parsing state and local laws that relate to abortion access, as well as administration of company health benefits that are self-funded versus covered under a fully insured plan, insurance experts, CEOs and HR executives said. </p><p>   To avoid estranging anyone, companies may structure the benefit to be broader than abortion, benefits experts said. </p><p>   \"It's not singling out abortion, but abortion is included,\" said Brian Marcotte, a healthcare consultant and former CEO of the Business Group on Health. Companies will \"make the communication as an enhancement to their travel benefit, so they are addressing it but not directly, and not creating an uproar.\" </p><p></p>",
