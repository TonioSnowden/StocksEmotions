  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Daycare, Fertility Shares Are Pressured by Pandemic",
  "text": "<p>Both companies have underperformed benchmark indexes so far this year. Shares in Bright Horizons are down about 4.9% in 2021 versus a gain of about 9% for the S&amp;P 500. And while Progyny shares are up about 8%, they lag behind a roughly 13.5% gain for the Russell 2000.</p><p>This reflects the impact of the pandemic and economic downturn. Job loss and economic strain amid a global pandemic appear to have postponed some people's decision to have children, while others have left the workforce to care for their kids. As a result of the pandemic, 300,000 fewer babies would be born in the U.S. in 2021 compared with last year, according to an estimate from the Brookings Institution.</p><p>\"Some women who wanted to become mothers were facing a lot more unknowns last year because of the pandemic,\" said Stephanie Davis, analyst at SVB Leerink, who nonetheless has a buy rating on Progyny.</p><p>Progyny in February issued conservative revenue guidance for 2021. It also said in its most recent annual filing that a lack of research on the impact of Covid-19 vaccines on pregnancy may hurt its business. The company generates the bulk of its revenue when employees use its benefits to cover fertility procedures such as egg freezing or in vitro fertilization. Progyny said it has 180 companies that offer its benefits, representing over 2.7 million eligible employees.</p><p>In 2020, female usage fell about 11% from 2019, when a significant majority of U.S. fertility clinics suspended treatment at the onset of the pandemic. Still, female usage in the fourth quarter rebounded and slightly topped the year-earlier period while revenue jumped about 54%. Expected long-term declines in the birthrate may pose another potential challenge, some analysts say.</p><p>But some investors believe another demographic trend will make up for this. More women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to have children. In fact, about 11% of women in the U.S. now have their first child after age 35, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Female fertility is known to decline with age.</p><p>As people have babies later in life, a greater number of employers are offering more generous fertility benefits. This will supersede the birthrate decline, said Alex Ely, chief investment officer of U.S. growth equity at Macquarie Investment Management.</p><p>Progyny faces competition from major insurers such as Cigna Corp. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. and private fertility companies including Carrot Fertility Inc., Maven Clinic Co. and Kindbody. But Mr. Ely said Progyny has greater scale, more technological capability and name recognition.</p><p>A declining birthrate largely won't hit big daycare businesses, some investors say. As parents feel more confident in sending their children back to daycare as vaccines become more widely available, demand will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, said Hamzah Mazari, equity analyst at Jefferies LLC.</p><p>Bright Horizons expects enrollment growth in its centers to resume in the second half of this year. Shares fell to a low of $69.95 in mid-March 2020, when the pandemic forced many businesses to temporarily close, but have since rebounded. They ended Friday at $164.79. Shaun Currie, equity analyst at T. Rowe Price, said he expects demand for Bright Horizons' daycare services to outstrip supply due in part to fewer mom-and-pop daycare locations and increased complexity around care, thanks to some employers' new hybrid work-from-home policies.</p>",
