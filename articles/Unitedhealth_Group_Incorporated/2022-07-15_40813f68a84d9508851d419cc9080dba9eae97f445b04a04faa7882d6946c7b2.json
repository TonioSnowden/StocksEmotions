  "title": "Dow Closes Up More Than 600 Points on Retail Spending Data; American shoppers lifted their spending in June amid high inflation and economic uncertainty",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 added 1.9% Friday, ending a five-session losing streak. Financial stocks paced the benchmark's gain. Citigroup rose 13%, State Street added 9.7% and Wells Fargo rose 6%.</p><p>The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite added 1.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 655 points, or 2.1%. All three indexes suffered weekly losses.</p><p>The market's volatile turn may be a sign the 2022 selloff is nearing a bottom, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. Companies' stock prices are now more closely aligned to projected earnings, and many investors are already accounting for the effects of rising interest rates, he said.</p><p>\"We're in a bottoming process,\" Mr. McMillan said. \"What you're seeing now depends on whether you see earnings as good or bad. Yesterday was bad, but we're still seeing expected earnings growth.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 traded recently at 16 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, down from 21.5 times at the end of last year, according to FactSet. Since the end of March, Analysts project quarterly earnings rose 4.2% in the latest quarter, according to FactSet.</p><p>Investors are trying to assess how officials will balance the need to tame inflation with concerns over a potential recession. U.S. consumer inflation accelerated to 9.1% in June, a pace not seen in more than four decades, boosting expectations among traders that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively to tame it. At the same time, tighter financial conditions could weigh on growth.</p><p>With more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity tied to household spending, recessions typically are accompanied by a pullback by consumers. Yet the Commerce Department reported that Americans' retail spending rose 1% in June from the prior month, after declining in May.</p><p>\"You don't get a recession by adding 6 million jobs or having consumer spending that isn't shrinking,\" Mr. McMillan said. \"A lot of the retail report was just inflation. But on the other hand, sales are not going down, either. This doesn't say 'recession.'\"</p><p>U.S. consumer sentiment leveled off in early July, staying at subdued levels amid concerns over inflation and a coming economic recession. The preliminary estimate of the consumer sentiment index published Friday by the University of Michigan increased to 51.1 in July from 50.0 in June, hovering near its all-time low.</p><p>\"Recession risks have risen since the beginning of the year,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"If we don't get any signal of consumer retrenchment, maybe it's not as bad as people fear, but if we do get that it's a signal recession risk is materializing.\"</p><p>Citigroup and Wells Fargo were among the financial companies that reported earnings ahead of the market open, sparking the rally in the banking sector. Citi posted better-than-expected profit and revenue, while Wells Fargo said a slowdown in mortgage lending hurt its results. State Street also beat Wall Street's expectations. U.S. Bancorp gained 5.5%, while Bank of America rose 7.5%.</p><p>As a group, financial stocks within the S&amp;P 500 climbed more than 3%.</p><p>Shares of Pinterest jumped 16% after The Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Elliott Management has taken a big stake in the social-media company. Vonage Holdings shares rose 6.8% after Swedish telecom-equipment giant Ericsson said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. had authorized its $6.2 billion proposal to buy the company.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group shares added 4.9% after the company raised its outlook for the second consecutive quarter and posted higher revenue and profit for the recently ended period.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.912% from 2.957% Thursday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, slid 0.1%, to $101.06 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.8%, though the index declined for the week. Italian political turmoil and worries that the Kremlin will end supplies to the Nord Stream pipeline that channels Russian natural gas to Europe have added to recession fears for the continent.</p><p>In Asia, China's Shanghai Composite fell 1.6%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 2.2%. China recorded its weakest growth rate in more than two years, a measure of the costs imposed on the world's second-largest economy by Beijing's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19.</p><p>South Korea's Kospi added 0.4%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.5%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Closes Up More Than 600 Points on Retail Spending Data</p>",
