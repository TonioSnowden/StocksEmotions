  "text": "<p>Fourth-quarter revenue for UnitedHealth climbed to $65.47 billion, up from $60.9 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast revenue of $64.96 billion. Revenue from premiums grew to $50.58 billion, from $47.63 billion a year earlier. The company logged higher revenue from products, services and investment income than it did in the year-earlier quarter.</p><p>As more people returned to medical providers for care that they avoided or postponed earlier in the pandemic, UnitedHealth's costs rose. UnitedHealthcare saw rising medical expenses tied directly to Covid-19.</p><p>Costs from Covid-19 represented 11% of health-care activity in the fourth quarter, the company said during a call with analysts. Inpatient care spending rose over the course of the quarter. Of the 65,000 Covid-19 admissions during the quarter, about half were in December, while 20% came in October.</p><p>UnitedHealth posted fourth-quarter net income of $2.21 billion, or $2.30 a share, compared with $3.54 billion, or $3.68 a share, in the year-earlier period.</p><p>On an adjusted basis, UnitedHealth's profit was $2.52 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast an adjusted profit of $2.41 a share.</p><p>Revenue from Optum grew in the quarter as the number of customers served rose by 2.1% to 98 million and as revenue per customer jumped 29% year over year. Prescription volume under the company's OptumRX business started to return to more normal levels as more health-care services returned after a lull earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>Optum's quarterly revenue was $35.9 billion, up from $29.8 billion a year ago.</p><p>Earlier this month, UnitedHealth agreed to pay roughly $8 billion to acquire Change Healthcare Inc., a health-care technology company that it said it plans to merge into Optum.</p><p>UnitedHealth said it expects its full-year profit in 2021 to be between $16.90 a share and $17.40 a share, or $17.75 a share to $18.25 a share on an adjusted basis. That estimate includes a negative effect of $1.80 a share from coronavirus-related concerns, UnitedHealth said, such as testing and treatment costs, deferred care from last year and broader economic factors.</p><p>During the call with analysts, UnitedHealth said it expected overall Covid-19 care costs in 2021 to be similar to the total for 2020.</p>",
