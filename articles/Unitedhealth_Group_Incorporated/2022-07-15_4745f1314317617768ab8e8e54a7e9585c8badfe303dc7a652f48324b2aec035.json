  "title": "UnitedHealth to Drop Copays on Some Widely Used Drugs; Move comes as company posts double-digit revenue growth for its Optum, UnitedHealthcare units",
  "text": "<p>UnitedHealth announced the initiative during its second-quarter earnings call. The healthcare and health-insurance company on Friday reported profit that beat analysts' expectations, and it raised its earnings guidance for the year.</p><p>In addition to insulin, used by patients with diabetes, and naloxone, which is administered to people suffering the effects of opioid overdoses, the zero-copay list will include epinephrine, administered to curb allergic reactions; glucagon, used to treat hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar; and albuterol, taken to ease breathing difficulties caused by asthma.</p><p>All of the drugs are available as generics, or as a copycat version known as a biosimilar.</p><p>UnitedHealth said the new zero-copay approach from its insurance arm, UnitedHealthcare, will take effect in 2023. The change will become standard for fully insured group plans, the type typically bought by smaller companies. UnitedHealth said around eight million people are enrolled in its fully insured plans and around 688,000 of them take the listed medications each year.</p><p>Employers with self-insured plans, typically used by larger companies and under which they pay their own claims, will be able to choose the setup, and the insurer will encourage them to adopt it, a UnitedHealth spokesman said.</p><p>Plans with no out-of-pocket charges for certain drugs aren't a new idea. Advocates have long argued that they can help ensure that patients don't skimp on important medications, and might save money overall by avoiding more serious, and costly, health problems.</p><p>The UnitedHealth spokesman said that the company has already submitted 2023 premium rates to regulators and that they didn't include effects from the new zero-copay design. \"Long term, we certainly do not expect any meaningful impact on our premium structures,\" he said.</p><p>During its earnings call, UnitedHealth also said it is on track toward its goal of adding 10,000 employed or affiliated doctors and advanced practitioners by the end of the year, continuing the rapid expansion of its Optum healthcare-services arm.</p><p>For the second quarter, UnitedHealth said revenue rose 13% to $80.3 billion, driven by double-digit revenue growth at Optum and UnitedHealthcare.</p><p>The company, based in Minnetonka, Minn., now expects full-year earnings of $20.45 a share to $20.95 a share, up 15 cents on either end from its prior guidance. On an adjusted basis, the outlook calls for earnings of $21.40 a share to $21.90 a share, up 20 cents on both ends of the range.</p><p>UnitedHealthcare's medical-care ratio, a closely watched measure of the proportion of premiums going to medical care, was 81.5%, down from 82.8% a year earlier and below analysts' expectations.</p><p>Profit for the quarter ended June 30 came in at $5.07 billion, or $5.34 a share, compared with $4.27 billion, or $4.46 a share, a year earlier. Excluding amortization and tax effects, profit was $5.57 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of $5.21 a share.</p><p>Revenue for the quarter of $80.3 billion topped estimates of $79.7 billion. The company's UnitedHealthcare insurance business saw revenue grow almost 12% to $62.11 billion. The business added 280,000 members in the second quarter, with growth in community-based and senior offerings leading the increase.</p><p>UnitedHealth's Optum health-services arm notched nearly 18% revenue growth in the period, with revenue rising to $45.08 billion.</p><p>Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>UnitedHealth to Drop Copays on Some Widely Used Drugs</p>",
