  "title": "Aerospace Firms Probed Over Alleged No-Poach Deals, First Charges Announced; Case against former Pratt & Whitney manager comes amid Justice Department push to crack down on agreements limiting wages, mobility",
  "text": "<p>Pratt employs more than 39,000 staff and is one of the world's largest engine makers, powering commercial aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo and the F-35 combat jet produced by Lockheed Martin Corp.</p><p>Mr. Patel and executives for the suppliers doing outsourced work on behalf of Pratt agreed not to hire or recruit each other's engineers or other skilled workers, which unlawfully limited the employees' wages and opportunities, the department alleged.</p><p>\"Mahesh says he does not want the salaries to increase,\" one alleged co-conspirator wrote in 2016, according to a court document. Another conspirator allegedly warned that if poaching between suppliers didn't stop, it would \"drive the price structure up,\" according to the document.</p><p>A lawyer representing Mr. Patel said he had no comment.</p><p>Mr. Patel lists himself as Pratt's director of global engineering sourcing on his LinkedIn page, having been with the company for 27 years. He no longer works for the company, according to a person familiar with its hiring.</p><p>Pratt has been a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies Corp. since 2020. Raytheon said it is cooperating with the inquiry and is committed to complying with applicable state and federal laws. The charges cover alleged events from 2011 to 2019, and involved a half-dozen firms, which weren't identified by name in court documents.</p><p>The Justice Department for several years brought a series of civil antitrust cases to crack down on no-poach agreements, particularly in the tech sector. But last year the department began warning that future violations would be charged criminally, and it has followed through on that threat.</p><p>Other no-poach criminal cases this year include charges against Surgical Care Affiliates, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc., and DaVita Inc. for allegedly suppressing recruitment of certain healthcare workers. The companies deny the allegations.</p><p>\"We will vigorously prosecute this and other cases in which corporate executives undermine the careers of their own workers in order to reap undeserved profits and deprive our fellow citizens of opportunities to earn a competitive wage,\" Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Kanter said thousands of workers were harmed by the aerospace industry agreements.</p><p>The market for aerospace engineers tightened last decade as airlines ordered thousands of new jets from Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, as well as engines from Pratt &amp; Whitney and rivals including General Electric Co. and Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC.</p><p>The engineering workforce is aging and aerospace companies face competition from tech and financial services companies, as well as other manufacturers, for talent. Aerospace engineers are viewed as particularly \"nomadic,\" according to a 2017 study backed by the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group, moving from program to program and between companies.</p><p>U.S. aerospace companies cut and furloughed almost 90,000 workers during the coronavirus pandemic after air travel slumped, according to the AIA. Many have resumed rehiring as passenger and cargo traffic recovers.</p><p>Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Aerospace Firms Probed Over Alleged No-Poach Deals, First Charges Announced</p>",
