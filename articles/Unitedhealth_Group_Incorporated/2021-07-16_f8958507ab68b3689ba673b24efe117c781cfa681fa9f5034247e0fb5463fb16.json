  "text": "<p>UnitedHealth and other health insurers saw profits balloon in 2020 as people pulled back on doctor visits and trips to hospital emergency rooms.</p><p>The Minnetonka, Minn.-based company owns the largest health insurer in the U.S., and is the first in that industry to report quarterly earnings. Its results are the latest sign that healthcare use is returning to pre-pandemic levels, while the impact from new variants of Covid-19 so far remains limited.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer John Rex said healthcare use among commercial patients is already slightly above typical rates, while people enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare plans are still not fully back to their usual patterns, with costs below baseline.</p><p>Overall, he said, new cancer and cardiac diagnoses are still running below typical levels. The effect from new variants of Covid-19 is also \"still fairly limited,\" he said in a call with analysts, and the number of UnitedHealth members being treated for the virus in hospitals now is well below where it was in April. UnitedHealth reiterated its projection that the pandemic would reduce its earnings by around $1.80 a share this year, with about 70% of the impact in the second half of the year.</p><p>The company flagged costs due to Covid-19 treatment and testing, as well as potentially higher medical needs due to conditions that worsened while people were steering clear of checkups, testing and other usual care.</p><p>Yet UnitedHealth raised its guidance for the full year, forecasting adjusted earnings of $18.30 to $18.80 a share in 2021. Three months ago, it had said it was expecting adjusted earnings of $18.10 to $18.60 a share.</p><p>UnitedHealth posted a quarterly profit of $4.46 a share for the second quarter, down from $6.91 a share in the prior-year period. Revenue climbed to $71.32 billion, from $62.14 billion in 2020's second quarter.</p><p>UnitedHealth's adjusted profit of $4.70 a share in the quarter was better than the $4.43 a share that Wall Street analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting. Shares were relatively flat in morning trading.</p><p>For the UnitedHealthcare insurance business, revenue climbed 13% year over year, benefitting from enrollment growth in the company's Medicaid and Medicare plans. But the insurance business's operating earnings fell by more than half, as the expansion was offset by returns toward normal levels of medical care.</p><p>The company's medical-loss ratio -- a measure of the proportion of premiums paid out for medical care -- rose to about 83% because of the return toward normal levels of healthcare use. A year ago, it was about 70%. Overall medical costs rose to $46.55 billion, up by more than a third year over year.</p><p>The insurer also logged growth in its Optum health-services arm, where revenue rose 17% to $38.3 billion.</p><p>Chief Executive Andrew Witty said Optum is about halfway to its goal of adding around 10,000 new employed or affiliated doctors and other healthcare providers this year.</p><p>Mr. Witty, asked by an analyst about the possibility of spinning off the direct-care unit as a separate company, defended the value of keeping it as part of UnitedHealth.</p><p>Mr. Witty also said UnitedHealth, which has a big pharmacy-benefit manager called OptumRx in addition to its insurance operations, needs more information before making coverage decisions about the new Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm. The medicine, from Biogen Inc., has limited clinical benefit but is likely to cost billions of dollars in coming years.</p>",
