  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> <strong>Arm </strong>is <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/19acf507-0d8a-424e-b35e-405e2f613ae0?\">planning to transfer shares</a> in its unwieldy China joint venture to a <strong>SoftBank</strong> special purpose vehicle in an attempt to speed up the UK chip designer's path to a New York flotation. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Ackman unveils Pershing Square 3.0</h2> <p><strong>Bill Ackman</strong> is putting his poison pen away and vowing to cease publicly fighting against incompetent corporate boards and overpaid chief executives.</p> <p>The billionaire *former* activist investor on Tuesday said his fund <strong>Pershing Square Capital Management </strong>will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c294c5d-44e7-41fd-8af5-42f4fa3567fd\">stop running activist campaigns</a>, choosing instead to take a quieter approach by investing in companies that don't require massive overhauls. </p> <p>Ackman will now buy large blocks of public companies and work exclusively behind the scenes on any recommendations for change, instead of undressing management publicly in proxy battles and shareholder challenges. </p> <p>The change, which Ackman is dubbing Pershing Square 3.0, marks a big shift in the way he invests after becoming one of Wall Street's most high-profile and feared activists. He has waged battles against companies including <strong>Wendy's</strong>, <strong>McDonald's</strong>, <strong>Fortune</strong> <strong>Brands</strong>, <strong>Canadian</strong> <strong>Pacific</strong> <strong>Railway</strong> and <strong>JCPenney</strong>.</p> <p>At the height of Ackman's hostilities in 2015, he was simultaneously waging an activist short campaign against multi-level-marketing company <strong>Herbalife</strong> and trying to engineer ever-larger pharmaceutical takeovers as a major shareholder of <strong>Valeant</strong> <strong>Pharmaceuticals</strong>. </p> <p>Both bets lost more than $1bn apiece and nearly caused the collapse of Pershing Square after a run of losses between 2015 and 2017 that led most institutional investors to pull their money from the hedge fund. </p> <p>During that woeful stretch, Ackman also failed to win shareholder challenges against railroad <strong>Norfolk</strong> <strong>Southern</strong> and payroll provider <strong>ADP</strong>, signifying diminishing effectiveness as an activist. </p> <p>Since 2017, Ackman has rebuilt Pershing Square by focusing on more passive investments in restaurant group <strong>Chipotle</strong> <strong>Mexican</strong> <strong>Grill</strong>, retailer <strong>Lowe's</strong> and hotelier<strong> Hilton Worldwide</strong>.</p> <p>The new strategy has paid off.</p> <p>In 2019 it generated a 58 per cent net return, about double the<strong> S&amp;P 500</strong>. During pandemic-plagued 2020, Pershing Square generated a 70 per cent net return, and the firm was able to keep pace with rising markets last year, gaining 26.9 per cent.</p> <p>Ackman also reconfirmed his commitment to abandon activist short selling. “[W]e have permanently retired from this line of work,” he said in the firm's 2021 annual report.</p> <p>And Ackman isn't the only activist changing his stripes. </p> <p>His longtime foe <strong>Carl</strong> <strong>Icahn</strong> deepened his efforts to improve the treatment of pigs on Tuesday by nominating new board directors at supermarket <strong>Kroger</strong>, following a similar hog-hugging campaign against <strong>McDonald's.</strong>&#xa0;</p> <h2>Whose yacht is it, anyway?</h2> <p>For some billionaires, owning a superyacht is just another frivolous indulgence, like eating a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/23/how-much-43-hot-dogs-at-davos.html\">$43 hot dog</a> at Davos or flying to space. </p> <p>Russian oligarchs, however, have found their luxury vessels to be a more integral part of their portfolios lately. The UK government can seize as many London mansions as it likes, but it's harder to impose sanctions in international waters.</p> <p>No one knows this better than <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong>. As the billionaire <strong>Chelsea Football Club </strong>owner's empire crumbles in London, two of his superyachts have found refuge in the Turkish ports of Marmaris and Bodrum as the local government remains reluctant to participate in the global economic affront to Russia.</p> <p>Those are just two that we know about. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51b9d1fe-3a20-498c-9828-cac56d04305b\">An investigation</a> by DD's Arash Massoudi and Robert Smith and the FT's Cynthia O'Murchu and Emiko Terazono has revealed that a mysterious yacht under investigation by the Antiguan government holds apparent links to Abramovich.</p> <p>The ship, called the Garçon, is docked at the southern tip of the Caribbean island, according to database <a href=\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-61.767/centery:17.016/zoom:17\"><strong>MarineTraffic</strong></a>. </p> <p>Ownership of the 67-metre explorer vessel (aka a yacht that acts as a support vessel for even bigger yachts) was transferred from Ukrainian billionaire <strong>Yuriy Kosiuk</strong> to a British Virgin Islands-domiciled company called <strong>Wenham Overseas Limited</strong> in January 2021, according to maritime database <strong>Equasis</strong>.</p> <p>Wenham is the owner of a <strong>Boeing</strong> 787 private jet that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.ru/milliardery/450283-roman-abramovic-kupil-samyj-dorogoj-v-rossii-castnyj-samolet\">previous press reports</a> have identified as being linked to Abramovich, according to aircraft registration documents. Abramovich is also named as the owner of Wenham in a private plane ownership database seen by the FT.</p> <p>The ship was under the management of Isle of Man-based <strong>Döhle Yachts</strong> as of August 2021, according to Equasis records. One insider told the FT that Döhle recently resigned from the contract and that Abramovich was its owner, adding that Abramovich may be seeking to transfer its beneficial ownership.</p> <p>Döhle and Abramovich declined to comment. </p> <p>The government of Antigua said it has yet to find any proof that the Garçon belongs to the billionaire. “We can't find a link and no one can tell us if there is a link to Abramovich,” said <strong>Ronald Sanders</strong>, Antiguan Barbudan ambassador to the US.</p> <p>It's not the only yacht with enigmatic ownership floating around out there. A superyacht docked in Tuscany <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/489e20e9-8bca-48e6-b840-806a890632c3\">has become the subject of a probe</a> by Italy's authorities after Russian opposition groups alleged it belongs to <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>.</p> <h2>Goldman Sachs tries to change its tune with investors</h2> <p><strong>David Solomon</strong> is looking to mix things up. And not just at his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CbbNMfNAqac/\">upcoming set</a> at Lollapalooza.</p> <p>The <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> boss is looking to push into businesses with steadier income streams including asset and wealth management as the industry's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bdef7a6-69f1-4f42-b27d-74dd34db4804\">costly talent war rages</a> on and revenue <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31dcd748-26d2-4f7a-ad3d-a3efc05c0f25\">shrinks</a>.</p> <p>In a move seeking to assuage investors that perceive the investment bank's earnings as more volatile than its Wall Street peers, Goldman is buying <strong>NextCapital</strong> — a robo-adviser that specialises in retirement plans.</p> <p>The deal for the Chicago-based financial services group follows the lofty goal set by the US bank last month to generate more than $10bn in fee-based income from its asset and wealth management divisions by 2024, up from $7.57bn in 2021.</p> <p>Goldman declined to disclose the price of the acquisition but said it would be among its five largest asset management deals.</p> <p>The largest-ever deal to bulk up its asset management unit occurred less than nine months ago, when it beat Frankfurt-based asset manager <strong>DWS</strong> to buy Dutch insurer<strong> NN Group</strong>'s investment management arm for €1.6bn in August.</p> <p>The moves signal 60-year-old Solomon's determination to reduce Goldman's reliance on volatile businesses such as equities and bond trading and keep pace with rivals.</p> <p>In 2020,<strong> Morgan Stanley</strong> created one of the world's biggest asset managers by scooping up US investment manager <strong>Eaton Vance</strong>. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> embarked on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d54b3a-b1e9-4f99-8ebd-3ec84a3ca1e5\">record buying spree</a> in 2021, while <strong>UBS</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/382aad01-ed32-4832-9e20-27b019db8918\">agreed to buy</a> robo-adviser <strong>Wealthfront</strong> in January for $1.4bn.</p> <p>Solomon made <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312522021660/d291377d8k.htm\">$35mn</a> last year as Goldman reaped record profits during Wall Street's M&amp;A frenzy. But his success at the US bank depends on his ability to convince investors that it can still meet higher profitability targets as the dealmaking boom inevitably begins to fade.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Private equity group <strong>Vista Equity Partners</strong> has appointed <strong>Nasdaq'</strong>s executive vice-president of investment intelligence <strong>Lauren Dillard</strong> as its new chief financial officer. She succeeds <strong>John Warnken-Brill</strong>, who is retiring from the role.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Burberry</strong> has appointed<strong> McKinsey </strong>veteran<strong> Orna NíChionna</strong> as senior independent director of its board. She has sat on the luxury fashion group's board since January 2018.</p></li>  <li><p>Brazil's president <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bb485c6-17e3-4dfd-8123-35e3b276f6bf\">is replacing</a> <strong>Joaquim Silva e Luna</strong> as chief executive of <strong>Petrobras</strong> with economist <strong>Adriano Pires</strong>. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>The blame game </strong>A criminal tax fraud investigation by the Manhattan district attorney looked to be one of the most damning legal threats looming over Donald Trump.
