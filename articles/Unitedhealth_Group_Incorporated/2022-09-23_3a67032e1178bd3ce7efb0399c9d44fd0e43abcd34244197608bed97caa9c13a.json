  "title": "Justice Department Loses Antitrust Bid to Block Sugar Industry Merger; A federal judge allows U.S. Sugar to acquire Imperial Sugar, the second failed merger challenge this week for antitrust enforcers",
  "text": "<p>The Justice Department, which sued last November to challenge the merger, argued the deal would lead to higher prices for consumers in key parts of the country.</p><p>The ruling is the second loss in a merger case this week for the department, after a judge in Washington, D.C., rejected its challenge to UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s $13 billion acquisition of health-technology firm Change Healthcare Inc.</p><p>The case was part of an early batch of merger challenges filed by the Justice Department's antitrust division under the leadership of Biden administration officials. The administration has pledged to take a harder enforcement line on corporate deal making and business conduct that it believes can suppress competition.</p><p>The department argued at an April trial that the deal between the sugar companies would leave most sales of refined sugar across the Southeast in the hands of only two producers, which would lead to a rise in prices for consumers.</p><p>A department spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>U.S. Sugar, based in Clewiston, Fla., and Imperial Sugar, based in Sugar Land, Texas, denied the allegations. They said the deal wouldn't raise prices but instead would increase the production of refined sugar and improve supply-chain logistics. U.S. Sugar has a plant in Florida and Imperial has its plant in Savannah, Ga.</p><p>U.S. Sugar said it was pleased with the ruling, \"enabling us to increase our sugar production, enhance the local Georgia economy and benefit our employees and customers.\"</p><p>Attorneys for the companies argued at trial that sugar purchasers would still have options after the merger because the product flows between geographic regions.</p><p>The companies also argued that the U.S. Agriculture Department had a program that regulates prices. The Justice Department argued the program wasn't a substitute for antitrust enforcement and said the USDA rules were designed to set a floor, not a ceiling, for prices.</p><p>Write to Erin Mulvaney at erin.mulvaney@wsj.com</p><p>Justice Department Loses Antitrust Bid to Block Sugar Industry Merger</p>",
