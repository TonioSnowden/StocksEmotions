  "text": "<p>One kind of patient, with a type of severe respiratory condition that is common among those admitted with COVID-19, is an example of the wide range. The rates for these patients usually spanned from less than $11,000 to more than $43,000, the analysis found, but some prices could be far higher, depending on the severity of the case.</p><p>At NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, the cost for a severe-respiratory patient was around $55,182 if the person were insured by&#xa0;CVS Health&#xa0;Corp.'s&#xa0;CVS Aetna, according to the hospital's data. For&#xa0;UnitedHealth Group&#xa0;Inc.'s&#xa0;UNH UnitedHealthcare, the hospital's disclosed rate is $64,326, while the price listed in the hospital's data for patients covered by&#xa0;Anthem&#xa0;Inc.'s&#xa0;ANTM Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield was $94,357.</p><p>The range of prices&#xa0;shows how similar hospital services can generate widely disparate bills. Even during the pandemic, and within the same hospital, the prices often&#xa0;reflect the leverage that an insurer has&#xa0;to wrangle discounts, as well as the hospital's market power to drive up its rates.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>Trending at WSJ.com:</p><p>Why COVID-19 shots don't last a lifetime</p><p>Mortgage payments are getting more and more unaffordable</p>",
