  "title": "Monday's Markets:  European, Chinese Stocks Gain  ---  Several companies set  to report earnings this  week, including Intel  and UnitedHealth  ----  By Joe Wallace and Chong Koh Ping",
  "text": "<p>   Global stocks edged up, as investors awaited a busy week of corporate earnings, economic data and central-bank decisions. </p><p>   The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2% following a mixed session in Asia. U.S. stock and bond markets were closed Monday for Martin Luther King Day. </p><p>   Stocks gathered steam early Tuesday as Asian trading began. Japan's Nikkei was up 1.3% at midday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.2%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.6%. </p><p>   Stocks have wobbled in recent days after a strong start to the year fueled by hopes of a vaccine-induced economic recovery that could be aided by further fiscal stimulus under the incoming administration. Though many investors expect the rally to continue, they say stocks are likely to remain bumpy in the coming weeks amid signs that high coronavirus case rates are hurting economic activity. </p><p>   \"The markets are in a way front-running the recovery and the normalization of economic activity,\" said Agnes Belaisch, chief European strategist at the Barings Investment Institute. Stocks are bound to pause intermittently given the disconnect between the market and the way Covid-19 restrictions are crimping the economic recovery, she said. </p><p>   Investors this week will parse quarterly earnings from dozens of companies, including J.B. Hunt Transport Services, UnitedHealth Group and Intel, for guidance about the outlook for profits and revenue over  2021. Monetary-policy decisions by the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are also on tap as well as surveys that will indicate business activity at the start of the year and President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. </p><p>    Carrefour slid 6.9% after the French grocer and Canadian convenience-store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard called off takeover talks. The decision came after the French government shot down Couche-Tard's offer to buy Carrefour, saying it threatened jobs and food security. </p><p>   \"The market is focusing back on some of the negatives,\" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. </p><p>   Executives will be cautious in offering guidance for the rest of the year given the degree of uncertainty and wide-ranging restrictions still in place to control coronavirus, he said. </p><p>   Among other individual stocks, Stellantis rose 6% as the auto maker, newly formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group, made its trading debut. Thyssenkrupp rose 7% after the German industrial conglomerate said it had been awarded a contract to build an electrolysis plant in Canada and Bloomberg reported that Thyssenkrupp was considering listing its steel division on the stock market. </p><p>   Airline stocks including Ryanair and Deutsche Lufthansa slipped, indicating nervousness among investors about the speed at which the travel sector will reopen. The U.K. on Monday imposed new rules requiring people arriving from abroad to self-isolate. </p><p>   \"If we're not getting a sense of a return to normalcy any time soon then clearly a lot of those kinds of reflation trades that everyone got on board with late last year will come under a bit of pressure,\" said Charles Hepworth, an investment director at Swiss asset manager GAM. </p><p>   Chinese stocks advanced Monday after data showed the world's second-largest economy enjoyed its best quarter of year-over-year growth in two years. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8% by the close. </p><p>   Gross domestic product rose 6.5% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. Growth for all of 2020 hit 2.3%, making China the only major world economy to grow in a year when the pandemic slammed activity globally. </p><p>    Ben Powell, chief investment strategist for Asia Pacific at BlackRock Investment Institute, said the data support the view that China's economic recovery stands to benefit from a global rebound later this year. Sectors driven by consumer spending, especially travel and leisure, will see the biggest recovery, Mr. Powell said. </p><p>   Investor sentiment was knocked by a Reuters report that the Trump administration has notified Huawei suppliers that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the Chinese company, Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note. </p><p>   In commodities, Brent-crude futures, the benchmark in international energy markets, fell 0.6% to $54.75 a barrel. </p><p>   Many investors and analysts remain upbeat about the prospects for stocks that are closely tied to the fortunes of the global economy. </p><p>   Shares in banks and energy companies are likely to benefit from rising bond yields and oil prices this year, said Patrik Lang, head of equity research at Swiss private bank Julius Baer. </p><p></p>",
