  "text": "<p>The planned combination, which the nonprofits are expected to announce Wednesday, would create an organization that they anticipate would have annual revenue next year of around $6.8 billion and membership of about 800,000 people.</p><p>The deal is the latest sign of how government-backed health coverage, including both Medicare and Medicaid, is increasingly the core of the managed-care business and the main engine of its growth.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How might the merger affect healthcare on the West Coast? Join the conversation below.</p><p>About 70% of Medicaid enrollees are now in managed-care plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>The deal, which must be approved by state regulators, isn't structured as an acquisition, and the two operations would remain distinct under the ownership of a common parent, the nonprofits said. SCAN would be focused on covering people on Medicare, and CareOregon on Medicaid enrollees.</p><p>Sachin Jain, SCAN's chief executive, would be CEO of HealthRight. Eric Hunter, the chief executive of CareOregon, will lead the company's Medicaid division.</p><p>SCAN, which is largely focused on Medicare, had revenue of around $3.6 billion last year. It has membership of around 275,000, mostly in California but also in Arizona, Nevada and, starting next year, Texas.</p><p>CareOregon has about 515,000 members, including those enrolled in dental and behavioral coverage, with about 319,000 medical members in Medicaid plans. It had revenue of around $2.1 billion last year.</p><p>Dr. Jain and Mr. Hunter said the combined operation would have greater scope to compete against large, for-profit rivals, as well as the capital to invest in needs like information technology and the leverage to potentially get better deals from vendors.</p><p>\"It's scale,\" said Dr. Jain. \"There are investments we would like to be making to serve our members.\"</p><p>The projected membership for the combined operation includes people enrolled in medical, behavioral and dental products.</p><p>The two executives said the combined nonprofit would aim to grow, both within the companies' current footprints and likely into other states. Both said they weren't planning any downsizing of their workforces. Eventually, they said, they might aim to link up with other nonprofits.</p><p>\"We have to show them it will work,\" Mr. Hunter said. \"That will resonate with a lot of these plans.\"</p><p>More people covered by government programs are receiving their benefits through private managed-care companies.</p><p>On the Medicare side, around 48% of eligible beneficiaries are now signed up forMedicare Advantage, the private-company version of Medicare. The share may cross the 50% threshold next year, said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, partly fueled by employers tapping the private Medicare plans for retiree coverage.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office has projected the share of beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage could rise to 61% in a decade.</p><p>As Medicaid and Medicare coverage has grown, large for-profit companies, which often own an array of healthcare assets, are commanding much of the business.</p><p>In Medicare Advantage, nearly half of enrollment is with UnitedHealth Group Inc. or Humana Inc. In Medicaid, Centene Corp. is another big player.</p><p>These large companies are investing deeply in data analysis, healthcare providers such as primary-care clinics and home-health services, and other assets, including consumer-facing technology tools.</p><p>Like other companies, the new HealthRight will aim to grow partly by cross-pollinating services between its different units, and selling services to others, including other health plans, the executives said. Among other assets, the combined firm would include a medical group that provides care for homeless older adults and units offering forms of home-based care.</p><p>The deal would need approval from state regulators, including going through Oregon's new healthcare merger-review process. The companies said they expected it to close in 2023.</p><p>Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at Anna.Mathews@wsj.com</p><p>Nonprofit Health Plans With $6.8 Billion in Projected Revenue Set to Combine</p>",
