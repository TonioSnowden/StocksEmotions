  "title": "U.S. News:  FTC to Investigate Six Largest Pharmacy-Benefit Managers  ----  By Kathryn Hardison and Joseph Walker",
  "text": "<p>   The Federal Trade Commission is investigating CVS Caremark, Express Scripts Inc. and other large pharmacy-benefits managers over what impact their business models have on the accessibility and affordability of prescription drugs. </p><p>   The FTC on Tuesday said it would require the six largest PBMs, which negotiate rebates and fees with drug manufacturers, to provide records and other information about their business practices. The documents will be used to conduct a study of the PBM industry, the FTC said. The compulsory orders are also being sent to UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s OptumRx Inc., Humana Inc., Prime Therapeutics LLC and MedImpact Healthcare Systems Inc. </p><p>   Pharmacy-benefit managers also reimburse pharmacies for patients' prescriptions and create drug formularies -- a list of prescription drugs that are paid for by a health plan -- and other policies. </p><p>   Independent pharmacies have criticized PBMs for charging them high fees and for steering consumers to PBM-owned mail-order pharmacies. The FTC said it would look into the tight integration that the PBMs have with both health-insurance companies and wholly owned mail-order and specialty pharmacies, and whether it gives the companies undue influence on what patients pay for their prescriptions and where they purchase them. </p><p>   The three largest PBMs -- OptumRx, Cigna Corp.'s Express Scripts, and CVS Health Corp.'s Caremark -- manage roughly 80% of U.S. prescriptions. </p><p>   \"Although many people have never heard of pharmacy-benefit managers, these powerful middlemen have enormous influence over the U.S. prescription drug system,\" FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan said. \"This study will shine a light on these companies' practices and their impact on pharmacies, payers, doctors, and patients.\" </p><p>   The inquiry will also look into the use of specialty-drug lists and related specialty-drug policies. The FTC said it has received more than 24,000 public comments about pharmacy-benefit managers. </p><p>   The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, an industry group, said PBMs lower drug costs for consumers and insurers by negotiating the lowest possible prices with drugmakers. </p><p>   \"We are confident that any examination of pharmacy-benefit managers, PBMs, will validate that PBMs are reducing prescription drug costs for consumers,\" PCMA Chief Executive JC Scott said. \"Drug manufacturer price-setting is the root cause of high drug costs.\" </p><p></p>",
