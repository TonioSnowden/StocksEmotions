  "title": "DOJ Dealt Blow in Suit  Against UnitedHealth  ----  By Anna Wilde Mathews and Brent Kendall",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled on Monday against a Justice Department antitrust challenge to UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s $13 billion acquisition of health-technology firm Change Healthcare Inc., rejecting government claims that the deal would unlawfully suppress competition and limit innovation in health-insurance markets. </p><p>   U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled for the companies in an opinion that he kept under seal for now because he said it \"may contain competitively sensitive information.\" The judge said he would release a redacted public version of the ruling in the coming days. In a one-page public order, he denied the Justice Department's request to block the companies from completing the deal. </p><p>   The court ruling represents an early blow to stepped-up antitrust enforcement by the Biden administration, which sued in February to block the deal. The Justice Department's top antitrust official, Jonathan Kanter, said the department disagreed with the decision and was considering its next steps. </p><p>   \"Protecting competition and access to affordable healthcare is of the utmost importance to the antitrust division and the Department of Justice,\" Mr. Kanter said. </p><p>   The ruling represents a triumph for UnitedHealth, which owns the largest U.S. health insurer and a healthcare operation that includes thousands of doctors as well as clinics and surgery centers, along with a powerful conglomeration of health data. </p><p>   In a statement, a UnitedHealth spokesman said, \"We are pleased with the decision and look forward to combining with Change Healthcare as quickly as possible so that together we can continue our work to make the health system work better for everyone.\" </p><p>   Change provides services related to payment processes for healthcare systems, analytics for financing and billing and tools that help hospitals make decisions about patient care. </p><p>   UnitedHealth had agreed to divest itself of business assets related to claims processing to address competition concerns, an offer the Justice Department had dismissed as insufficient. </p><p>   Judge Nichols in his order required UnitedHealth to make that divestiture. </p><p>   UnitedHealth's deal for Change, announced in January 2021, would bring the health-technology company under the company's Optum health-services arm. UnitedHealth had argued that its combination with Change could help improve care by getting better information to doctors, and reduce waste. It agreed to pay nearly $8 billion for Change and assume about $5 billion in debt. </p><p>   The Justice Department had argued that the deal would give UnitedHealth a virtual monopoly on a key tool that health insurers use to determine when a claim should be paid. And it said the company shouldn't be allowed to own Change's data clearinghouse, which rival insurers use to compete with UnitedHealth. </p><p>   The judge, an appointee of President Donald Trump, a Republican, signaled his skepticism of the lawsuit in a hearing earlier this month. A trial took place in August. </p><p>   The lawsuit was part of an early batch of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department under President Biden, a Democrat. The suits were designed to take a harder line on corporate deal activity. Among other cases, the department is waiting on a ruling in its challenge to a publishing deal, Penguin Random House's planned acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster. And it is preparing to go to trial next week in its lawsuit challenging a partnership between American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. </p><p>   The current crop of antitrust officials, backed by calls from Democrats for a more aggressive approach, have sought to set new court precedents that would steer the law in a broader direction, after years of rulings in which the judiciary has tended to read the antitrust laws more narrowly than a generation ago. Monday's decision served as a reminder that the Justice Department's goals are dependent on proving their cases in front of a judge. </p><p>   UnitedHealth and its rivals have continued to move more deeply into vertical integration of various health assets, spanning insurance and healthcare provider businesses, as well as pulling together ever-larger troves of health data. </p><p>   Even after the Justice Department filed suit to block the Change deal, UnitedHealth moved ahead with other acquisitions, including a $5.4 billion takeover of home-health company LHC Group Inc. </p><p></p>",
