  "title": "U.S. News:  Two Antitrust Trials Set  To Test Enforcement Push  ----  By Erin Mulvaney, Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg and Jan Wolfe",
  "text": "<p>   Two merger trials, each beginning Monday at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., will provide an early test for Biden administration antitrust enforcement and determine the fate of multibillion-dollar deals in the publishing and healthcare industries. </p><p>   In one case the Justice Department is challenging book publisher Penguin Random House's nearly $2.18 billion acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster, a deal that would combine two of the industry's big-five publishers. In the other, the department is seeking to block UnitedHealth Group Inc., the parent of the nation's largest insurer, from acquiring health-technology firm Change Healthcare Inc., a deal valued at $13 billion. </p><p>   The lawsuits are part of the Biden administration's push to be more aggressive in bringing cases against deals that it believes will suppress competition. In the publishing case, the department argues the merger will hurt authors, especially bestselling ones, by reducing the number of publishing houses that compete for their work. Among its expected witnesses is Stephen King, a longtime Simon &amp; Schuster author who has voiced support for the government's challenge. </p><p>   In the healthcare litigation, the department argues UnitedHealth's acquisition would give it access to sensitive industry data that it could use to harm competitors. The companies in both matters deny the allegations and say the government misunderstands their industries. </p><p>   The cases represent a conscious strategy by the Justice Department to expand the frontiers of merger enforcement, said William Kovacic, law professor at George Washington University and former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>   \"The stated objective of the government is to reclaim enforcement terrain that had been surrendered,\" Mr. Kovacic said. \"Both of these cases have elements that are intended to push the boundaries of antitrust law outward.\" </p><p>   The publishing case, being heard by U.S. District Judge Florence Pan, an appointee of President Biden, comes amid years of industry consolidation. Penguin Random House, itself the result of a 2013 merger, is today the world's largest consumer-book publisher, boasting such top-selling authors as John Grisham, Ibram X. Kendi and Margaret Atwood in the U.S. </p><p>   German media company Bertelsmann SE, which owns Penguin Random House, agreed in November 2020 to buy Simon &amp; Schuster from ViacomCBS -- now called Paramount Global. </p><p>   Through July 16, Penguin Random House accounted for about 22% of all print books sold in the U.S., according to book tracker NPD BookScan, while Simon &amp; Schuster, whose authors include Mr. King, Colleen Hoover and Bob Woodward, accounted for 9%. </p><p>   In court papers, the defendant publishers argue the industry is robust, with smaller publishers outpacing one or more larger rivals in book acquisitions every year. They say their merger would benefit authors and consumers by combining Simon &amp; Schuster's popular backlist of titles with Penguin Random House's \"industry-leading distribution structure and administrative systems.\" </p><p>   The Justice Department, which filed suit last November, argues a combination of the two companies would create an entrenched giant that will \"dominate the U.S. publishing industry with revenues twice that of its next closest competitor.\" </p><p>   The Justice Department has staked its case on what it describes as the market for authors whose books are acquired through publisher advances of at least $250,000, which it said totaled over $1 billion in 2020. Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster said the $250,000 number was an arbitrary one that encompassed about 1,200 books annually, or about \"2% of all books published by commercial publishers.\" </p><p>   The case is expected to last about three weeks, with a decision anticipated in coming months. The UnitedHealth case, in front of U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, is on a similar timeline. </p><p>   UnitedHealth, which agreed in January 2021 to buy Change Healthcare for nearly $8 billion and assume $5 billion in debt, wants to combine the technology firm with its own health-services arm, Optum. Change Healthcare provides services related to payment processes for healthcare systems, analytics for financing and billing, and tools that help hospitals make decisions about patient care. </p><p>   UnitedHealth has said the combined company could improve care by providing better information to doctors and reduce waste by making the healthcare payment process more efficient. </p><p>   The healthcare behemoth has grown in recent years with acquisitions that have faced only limited antitrust pushback. Mr. Biden targeted healthcare markets, including insurance, hospital and prescription drug markets, as a focus in a July 2021 executive order that targeted competition issues. </p><p>   The Justice Department argues the deal would give UnitedHealth a virtual monopoly on a key tool that health insurers use to determine when a claim should be paid. And it says the company shouldn't be allowed to own Change Healthcare's data clearinghouse, which rival insurers use to compete with UnitedHealth. </p><p>   The company says it has addressed any concerns about competition by agreeing to sell off one of Change's business lines. And it says that Optum has long had access to rival insurers' data because it had provided products and services to those companies. </p><p></p>",
