  "title": "KKR's Envision in Talks for More Lenders to Join Restructuring Push; The physician-staffing business is discussing a new debt exchange with lenders that were left out of a disputed financing deal last month, people familiar with the matter say",
  "text": "<p>The discussions come after the company shifted its ambulatory services unit AmSurg Corp. out of the reach of term lenders owed roughly $3.5 billion and used the asset to secure $2.6 billion in new loans. Envision and KKR declined to comment.</p><p>The company is now exploring another deal covering the left-out lenders that could swap their holdings for new debt backed once again by AmSurg on a first- or second-lien basis, people familiar with the matter said. Envision also could issue new debt at the core subsidiary where the original loans currently sit, the people familiar said.</p><p>Last month's debt deal, led by outside investors Centerbridge Partners LP and Angelo Gordon &amp; Co., helped Envision cut down debt and raise cash to weather business headwinds. Other private-equity-backed companies have engineered similar deals in recent years to free up collateral for new investment. Some have been challenged in court, though most have ended in negotiated settlements.</p><p>Envision has faced pandemic-related headwinds in the healthcare industry, as well as contract battles with insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. and a lobbying fight in Washington over surprise medical billing. KKR bought Envision for $5.5 billion in cash and an additional $5 billion in debt in 2018, making it among the investment firm's biggest healthcare bets.</p><p>Credit-rating firms have said that last month's exchange amounts to a default on the term loan. That has caused difficulties for lenders holding it in collateralized loan obligation portfolios, giving them reason to negotiate with Envision, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Carrying deeply discounted loans rated in default hurts the performance of CLO vehicles, bundles of junk-rated corporate loans packaged into securities. S&amp;P Global Ratings said on Monday it doesn't believe that Envision has put its capital structure on stable footing, despite a roughly $600 million reduction in indebtedness in last month's deal and influx of cash to the balance sheet.</p><p>The company and its advisers are only compiling offers of interest about another debt exchange and haven't agreed on any specific terms, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Envision has suggested it is open to a follow-on exchange at a roughly 50% discount, compared with the average 34% discount in last month's deal, some of the people said. The company is targeting an additional $600 million in debt reduction through future transactions, a person familiar said.</p><p>Lenders advised by law firm Kasowitz Benson &amp; Torres LLP have been examining their legal options after losing access to AmSurg, which had made up roughly half their collateral package. That lender group had previously engaged with the company to try to participate in a debt exchange, but the company selected the offer from Centerbridge and Angelo Gordon instead. Kasowitz didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Envision earnings released privately on Friday showed the company's performance weakened during the first three months of 2022, people familiar with the matter said. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter had swung negative for the first time since KKR's buyout.</p><p>However, the company didn't report a rise in automatic revenue stabilizers that hospitals are obliged to kick in when losses mount, despite the reported drop off in Envision's earnings and margin, the people added.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
