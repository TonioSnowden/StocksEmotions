  "title": "Thursday's Markets:  Stocks Rally as 9 of 11 S&P Sectors Gain  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Caitlin McCabe",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks rallied broadly, as shares of banks and technology and travel companies rose. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 gained 26.44 points, or 0.6%, to 4429.10, rebounding after the broad market index closed down 0.5% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 271.58 points, or 0.8%, to end at 35064.25. </p><p>   The Nasdaq Composite rose 114.58 points, or 0.8%, to 14895.12. </p><p>   Major U.S. stock indexes have wobbled in recent days amid concerns that the economic rebound may be slowing. A rapid rise in new Covid-19 cases recently has added to concerns, too. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration's chief medical adviser, said recently that he didn't believe the U.S. would return to lockdowns but warned that \"things are going to get worse\" as the more contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 spreads. </p><p>   Still, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished at records, with the broad benchmark index notching its 43rd record close of the year. The Nasdaq Composite has reached 27 records in 2021. The Dow is hovering at just 0.2% below its closing high last reached July 26. </p><p>   Strong earnings results in the second quarter have helped boost share prices, even as economic data have been mixed. Data Thursday showed the trade deficit widened to $75.7 billion in June, more than economists had forecast, as Americans bought more goods from overseas. </p><p>   Meanwhile, jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, dropped slightly to 385,000 last week. Workers' filings for new unemployment benefits are still hovering at a level that is nearly double the pre-pandemic average. </p><p>   \"We're pretty positive, we think that the earnings data is very strong,\" said Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. Equity markets can continue to climb by 5% to 10% over the next year, she said. </p><p>   The continued signs of weakness in the labor market also suggest that the Federal Reserve will hold off on scaling back its easy-money policies for now, Ms. Simmons added. </p><p>   \"Unemployment is higher than it was pre-pandemic, and central banks feel there is still excess capacity in the labor market,\" Ms. Simmons said. \"When it comes to it, we believe that monetary tightening will be relatively gradual, well flagged and, actually, equities will probably be able to absorb it.\" </p><p>   Nine of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors rallied, with only the healthcare and materials groups finishing lower. Marathon Oil, Wynn Resorts and American Airlines were among the benchmark index's biggest winners, with all three rising 6.7% or more. </p><p>   In contrast, Cigna tumbled by $25.27, or nearly 11%, to $206.21, its worst one-day performance since March 2020. Other health insurers including UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Anthem also fell, each losing 2.4% or more. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.217% from 1.183% on Wednesday, marking three consecutive sessions of gains. </p><p>   In corporate news, Uber gained $1.26, or 3%, to finish at $43.07, erasing earlier losses, after the company reported a bigger loss than analysts expected and said it had to spend on incentives for drivers amid a shortage. </p><p>   Online marketplace Etsy fell $19.69, or 9.7%, to $182.41 after its results showed a slowdown in buyer growth. Travel firm Booking Holdings rose $122.07, or 5.9%, to $2,207.71, after its quarterly revenue more than tripled. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.4%. </p><p>   The Bank of England on Thursday kept its policy rate and bond-buying program stable, in line with investors' expectations, and said that it may begin unwinding quantitative easing earlier than previously planned. </p><p>   Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.3% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
