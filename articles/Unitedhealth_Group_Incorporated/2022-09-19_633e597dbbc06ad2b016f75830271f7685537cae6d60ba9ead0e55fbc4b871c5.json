  "title": "Judge Rejects Antitrust Challenge to UnitedHealth Acquisition; Ruling deals blow to Biden administration enforcement and clears health giant to buy health-technology firm Change Healthcare",
  "text": "<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled for the companies in an opinion that he kept under seal for now because he said it \"may contain competitively sensitive information.\" The judge said he would release a redacted public version of the ruling in the coming days. In a one-page public order, he denied the Justice Department's request to block the companies from completing the deal.</p><p>The court ruling represents an early blow to stepped-up antitrust enforcement by the Biden administration, which sued in February to block the deal. The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The decision is a triumph for UnitedHealth, which owns the largest U.S. health insurer and a healthcare operation that comprises thousands of doctors as well as clinics, surgery centers and other assets, along with a powerful conglomeration of health data.</p><p>In a statement, a UnitedHealth spokesman said, \"We are pleased with the decision and look forward to combining with Change Healthcare as quickly as possible so that together we can continue our work to make the health system work better for everyone.\"</p><p>Change provides services related to payment processes for healthcare systems, analytics for financing and billing and tools that help hospitals make decisions about patient care.</p><p>UnitedHealth had agreed to divest business assets related to claims-processing to address competition concerns, an offer the Justice Department had dismissed as insufficient.</p><p>Judge Nichols included the proposed divestiture in his order.</p><p>UnitedHealth's deal for Change, announced in January 2021, will bring the health-technology company under the company's Optum health-services arm. UnitedHealth had argued that its combination with Change could help improve care by getting better information to doctors, and reduce waste. It agreed to pay nearly $8 billion for Change and assume about $5 billion in debt.</p><p>The Justice Department had argued that the deal would give UnitedHealth a virtual monopoly on an important tool that health insurers use to determine when a claim should be paid. And it said the company shouldn't be allowed to own Change Healthcare's data clearinghouse, which rival insurers use to compete with UnitedHealth.</p><p>The judge, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, signaled his skepticism of the lawsuit in a hearing earlier this month. A trial took place in August.</p><p>The judge's decision comes as UnitedHealth and its rivals have continued to move more deeply into vertical integration of health assets, spanning insurance and healthcare provider businesses, as well as pulling together ever-larger troves of health data.</p><p>Even after the Justice Department filed suit to block the Change deal, UnitedHealth moved ahead with other acquisitions, including a $5.4 billion takeover of home-health company LHC Group Inc. announced last March.</p><p>Earlier this month, CVS Health Corp.—the parent of health insurer Aetna, a pharmacy-benefit operation and its eponymous drugstores—announced an $8 billion deal to take over home-healthcare company Signify Health Inc. CVS has said it wants to get deeper into the business of primary care.</p><p>Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com</p><p>Judge Rejects Antitrust Challenge to UnitedHealth Acquisition</p>",
