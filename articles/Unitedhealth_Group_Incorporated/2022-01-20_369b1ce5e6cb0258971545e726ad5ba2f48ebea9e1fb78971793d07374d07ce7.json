  "title": "Business News:  UnitedHealth Reports Growth Despite Omicron  ----  By Matt Grossman and Anna Wilde Mathews",
  "text": "<p>    UnitedHealth Group Inc. posted year-over-year earnings growth for the last three months of 2021, helped by higher revenue from premiums, and reaffirmed its financial projections for 2022. </p><p>   The healthcare and health-insurance giant, the first industry heavyweight to report year-end results, showed little serious impact from costs tied to soaring levels of Covid-19 cases that the Omicron variant brought last month. </p><p>   The Minnetonka, Minn.-based company also reassured investors that its 2022 earnings guidance released in November was intact, including for robust growth in its Medicare Advantage enrollment, a closely watched business for UnitedHealth and the managed-care sector as a whole. </p><p>   During a call with analysts Wednesday, UnitedHealth executives signaled the Omicron variant is generally causing a less-severe form of Covid-19, echoing findings in other data. The company said inpatient hospitalization levels are similar to what it saw in January 2021, even though cases are at a far higher level. </p><p>   As has happened when the virus surges, levels of typical healthcare use dropped off in tandem, UnitedHealth said, with primary-care visits down about 10% in recent weeks and visits to specialists showing a deeper decline. The company said the savings from these reductions is offsetting additional costs from Covid-19 care and testing, which is being boosted by a federal mandate that insurers cover over-the-counter tests. </p><p>   UnitedHealth's fourth-quarter profit rose to $4.07 billion, from $2.21 billion in 2020's final period. On a per-share basis after stripping out one-time items, earnings were $4.48, up from $2.52. Wall Street analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $4.30 a share. </p><p>   Revenue climbed to $73.74 billion, from $65.47 billion a year before. Most of that growth came from higher premiums, which rose to $57.55 billion, from $50.58 billion in the last quarter of 2020. </p><p>   UnitedHealth said it is holding to its 2022 outlook, including for revenue of $317 billion to $320 billion and adjusted earnings of $21.10 a share to $21.60 a share. Both represent double-digit annual growth. </p><p>   Shares closed Wednesday slightly higher at $462.52. The stock is up roughly 31% over the past 12 months. </p><p>   The company's UnitedHealthcare insurance business saw revenue grow 12% in the fourth quarter to $56.4 billion. The business added 2.2 million members last year, with growth in programs tied to government benefits, such as Medicare Advantage, driving much of the increase. </p><p>   UnitedHealth's Optum health-services arm notched 14% growth in the period, with revenue rising to $41.1 billion. Its tally of people served rose to 100 million in 2021, from 98 million a year earlier. </p><p></p>",
