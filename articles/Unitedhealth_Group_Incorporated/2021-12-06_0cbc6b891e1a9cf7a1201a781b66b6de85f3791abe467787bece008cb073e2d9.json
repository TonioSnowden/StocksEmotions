  "title": "Mallinckrodt Drug Insurers Denied Priority Bankruptcy Claims for Alleged Price Gouging; A bankruptcy judge says Humana and others failed to prove the company violates antitrust law in the pricing of its flagship drug, Acthar",
  "text": "<p>As a result, the insurers aren't entitled to the $382 million in top-ranking administrative claims they had brought against Mallinckrodt in its chapter 11 proceedings, Judge Dorsey said.</p><p>Humana and others had sued Mallinckrodt before its bankruptcy over price increases for Acthar, which is used to treat infantile spasms, multiple sclerosis and other ailments and costs roughly $38,000 a vial, up from about $50 in 2001.</p><p>The insurer argued the cost of any wrongdoing should continue to accrue while Mallinckrodt is in bankruptcy and be treated as administrative expenses, which must be paid in full ahead of other creditors for the company to leave chapter 11. Humana has said it continues to pay about $7.5 million every month for the drug, a price it alleged is inflated by anticompetitive conduct.</p><p>Humana and its lawyers didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</p><p>In October, the judge rejected Mallinckrodt's arguments that its postbankruptcy sales of Acthar couldn't as a matter of law be continuing violations of U.S. antitrust law or give rise to administrative claims.</p><p>But he left open until Monday the question of whether Mallinckrodt was in fact restraining competition and whether its continuing sales of Acthar entitled Humana and others to administrative priority.</p><p>The dispute lay at the intersection between bankruptcy and antitrust law. On one side was Mallinckrodt, which said none of the alleged improper marketing occurred during the bankruptcy and that any liability predating its chapter 11 and should be discharged to give it a fresh start.</p><p>On the other was Humana and investment firm Attestor Ltd., which acquired the claims against Mallinckrodt held by other health insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and CVS Health Corp.'s Aetna Inc. They argued that Mallinckrodt was using bankruptcy to immunize itself from liability for ongoing monopoly pricing, forcing them as captive creditors to bear the cost of the company's restructuring efforts.</p><p>Mallinckrodt filed for chapter 11 in large part to address an onslaught of lawsuits over its production and sale of opioids, but it also faced billions of dollars in claims over Acthar.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
