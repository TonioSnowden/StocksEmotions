  "title": "KKR's Envision Sparks Lender Dispute With Centerbridge, Angelo Gordon Deal; A recapitalization deal for Envision Healthcare comes at the expense of most prior lenders, releasing their claims on its AmSurg unit",
  "text": "<p>Envision said Friday that it would borrow up to $1.3 billion in first-lien loans and $1.3 billion in second-lien loans that would help repurchase existing debt and reduce the company's total indebtedness by roughly $600 million.</p><p>The new borrowing is backed by AmSurg Corp., an ambulatory services unit that made up around half of Envision's earnings in 2021, according to people familiar with the matter. Lenders to the company previously had collateral rights on AmSurg as part of their collateral package before the liens were released and roughly 80% of the subsidiary moved to a new affiliate.</p><p>Lenders on Monday explored potential legal remedies against the company with law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The original lenders allege that the transaction may not be allowed under the company's debt documents, according to the people familiar with the deal. The lenders also questioned whether the company is still allowed to carry the same amount of outstanding debt in the remaining company after the assets are moved, said one of the people.</p><p>Envision and AmSurg merged in 2016, in an all-stock transaction worth $15 billion that saw Envision stockholders owning around 53% of the combined company and AmSurg shareholders with 47%.</p><p>Existing secured lenders to the company previously had liens on AmSurg as well as Envision's core physicians business tied to around $5 billion in term loans the company borrowed when KKR agreed to buy the company in 2018. KKR purchased Envision Healthcare for $5.5 billion in cash and an additional $5 billion in debt, making it one of the investment company's largest acquisitions in the healthcare industry to date.</p><p>The recapitalization transaction that was announced Friday entailed Envision releasing the existing AmSurg liens, moving about 80% of AmSurg into a new corporate subsidiary, the people said.</p><p>Envision's old term loan has dropped in value since Friday's announcement. Banks quoted the loan between 48.5 to 50.5 cents on the dollar on Monday, compared with between 61 to 63 cents on the dollar on Thursday, according to sources.</p><p>Based on the terms of its existing loan documents, Envision believes it has the right to shift assets away from creditors based on the size of certain payment baskets that effectively allow the company to reorganize some portion of its assets into new, unrestricted subsidiaries, according to people close to Envision. Additionally, Envision tried to engage with its existing lenders to include them in the recapitalization deal but was ultimately unsuccessful, one of the people said.</p><p>Similar transactions that stripped lenders of their collateral rights in new money financings have seen challenges in court, although they have mostly ended in settlements.</p><p>Envision has faced headwinds due to the pandemic that have hurt the company's finances, one of the people close to Envision said. The company's earnings declined by around 70% at the height of the pandemic, and Envision has still struggled to find a solid footing.</p><p>The company has faced a litany of other problems, including bruising contract battles with insurance company UnitedHealth Group Inc. and a costly lobbying fight in Washington over legislation to curb surprise medical bills, which arise when patients are treated at hospitals in their insurance networks by out-of-network doctors.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com and Jodi Xu Klein at jodi.klein@wsj.com</p>",
