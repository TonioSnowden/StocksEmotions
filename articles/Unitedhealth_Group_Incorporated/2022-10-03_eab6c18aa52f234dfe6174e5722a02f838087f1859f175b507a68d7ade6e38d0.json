  "title": "Business News:  FTC Investigates  Anesthesia Provider  ----  By Dave Michaels",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission is investigating one of the country's largest anesthesiology providers, U.S. Anesthesia Partners, over whether it has amassed too much power in some regional markets through acquisitions, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   USAP has 4,500 anesthesia providers in nine states, including Texas, Colorado and Florida. The company, founded in 2012 by private-equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, has grown by acquiring smaller anesthesiology groups and rolling them up into a consolidated entity that manages hospital contracts, billing, insurance agreements and other functions. </p><p>    Tony Good, a spokesman for USAP, confirmed the investigation and said it was a \"relatively common\" inquiry related to competition in healthcare. \"Specifically, the FTC's focus seems to be on USAP's acquisition history,\" Mr. Good said. \"We have grown successfully over the past decade and we are serving patients across multiple states and providing them with high-quality care.\" </p><p>   The company is cooperating with the inquiry, he said, adding that the FTC probe isn't focused on \"irregularities in billing or patient care.\" </p><p>   The investigation, which began more than a year ago, according to people familiar with the matter, is an example of stricter government scrutiny of private equity's involvement in the healthcare industry under FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan. Ms. Khan has criticized what she calls private equity's focus on short-term profits, which she said \"can incentivize practices that may reduce quality of care, increase costs for patients and payers, and generate appalling patient outcomes.\" </p><p>   USAP has battled with insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. over its payment rates. Two years ago, the company left UnitedHealth's network and sued the insurer in Colorado and Texas state courts, alleging the insurer took unlawful steps to force it out of UnitedHealth's network and hurt its relationship with hospitals and physicians. The two sides reached an agreement for USAP to be a part of UnitedHealth's network, and USAP dropped the suit. </p><p>   In 2019, USAP was the largest provider of anesthesiology services to Medicare beneficiaries in the Houston and Denver markets, according to research by Loren Adler of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. USAP then controlled about 35% of the anesthesiology market in Texas and 30% in Colorado, according to Mr. Adler. </p><p>   Mr. Good of USAP disputed those estimates but declined to provide its market share. </p><p>   Private-equity firms have acquired specialty healthcare providers because their work is often high-volume and high-margin, and smaller groups can be combined to form larger networks that have more leverage with hospitals and insurers. The anesthesiology industry's profit margin was estimated at 12.5% in 2021, down from 14% before the pandemic, which reduced elective surgeries, according to data provider IBISWorld. </p><p>   Private-equity-owned providers represented about 15% of the Medicare market for anesthesia nationally in 2019, Mr. Adler said. </p><p>   Welsh Carson manages roughly $15 billion in assets and invests in companies focused on tech and healthcare, according to regulatory disclosures. It joined with Greater Houston Anesthesiology in 2013 to form USAP. USAP's owners also include Boston private-equity firm Berkshire Partners and Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. The company's 1,500 anesthesiologists own part of the company. </p><p>   Berkshire declined to comment, and GIC didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Prices paid for anesthesiology increased 26% after outpatient healthcare facilities, including hospitals, switched to practices owned by private-equity firms, according to a paper published in February by researchers from Columbia University and Weill Cornell Medical College in the Journal of the American Medical Association. </p><p>   As large, private-equity-backed anesthesia groups gain more market share in a region, they tend to have success negotiating higher prices, according to Ambar La Forgia, a professor at Columbia and one of the paper's authors. </p><p>   \"USAP has a very strong presence in Texas,\" Dr. La Forgia said. \"So the more facilities they have in Texas, the more they learn about that specific negotiation environment with the insurers there, and the more leverage they gain because now they can really dominate the network.\" </p><p>   Mr. Good said the anesthesia market is highly competitive and that insurers want USAP to be in-network because it provides quality care and has good patient outcomes. </p><p></p>",
