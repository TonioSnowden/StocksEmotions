  "title": "Justice Department Sues to Block UnitedHealth's Planned Buy of Change Healthcare; Antitrust lawsuit argues $13 billion tie-up would lead to higher costs",
  "text": "<p>The Justice Department filed its lawsuit in federal court in Washington, arguing the deal \"threatens to reduce competition among U.S. commercial health insurers, thereby harming health insurance customers (employers) and their individual members, all of whom rely on competition between United and its rivals to keep healthcare affordable.\"</p><p>The lawsuit comes at a time of aggressive antitrust enforcement by the Biden administration. In recent months, the Justice Department also has challenged transactions in the airline, publishing and sugar industries.</p><p>The department and the Federal Trade Commission, which share enforcement authority, both have signaled they are paying particular attention to healthcare markets. Last week, the FTC sued to challenge the merger of two major hospital systems in Rhode Island. And in a July 2021 executive order on competition issues, President Biden called out healthcare markets, including insurance, hospital and prescription drug markets, as a major focus.</p><p>UnitedHealth said in a statement that the Justice Department's \"deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the healthcare system. We will defend our case vigorously.\" It said the two companies can \"increase efficiency and reduce friction in health care, producing a better experience and lower costs.\"</p><p>UnitedHealth is a healthcare behemoth, with annual revenue of about $288 billion last year. Its insurance unit, UnitedHealthcare, is the biggest American insurer, covering around 45 million people in the U.S. Optum provides an array of services, including one of the largest pharmacy-benefit managers. It also has a sprawling network of clinics, surgery centers and physician practices, with around 60,000 employed or affiliated doctors, a number expected to continue growing rapidly.</p><p>Despite its scale after years of deal making, UnitedHealth has faced only limited antitrust pushback until now. Its more recent acquisitions have often expanded its heft vertically into more segments of healthcare, and added to its provider footprint in new geographies. Many of the company's deals also have been small enough to draw little national antitrust attention. UnitedHealth didn't join in as other big insurers attempted to merge with one another in two major deals that both foundered in 2017 after being challenged by the Justice Department.</p><p>Change Healthcare provides services that play a little-known but key role in the complex healthcare ecosystem: It acts as a claims clearinghouse, providing an array of services related to healthcare payment processes. The company works for healthcare providers, providing analytics related to finances and billing, as well as key technology tools that help hospitals make decisions about how to care for patients.</p><p>Optum, for its part, offers many similar information-technology and analytics services, creating potential overlap with Change Healthcare that spurred industry concerns about eliminating head-to-head competition.</p><p>Opponents of the deal have also focused on the unique data pool that Change Healthcare can tap, with its broad vantage point on medical decision making and how money flows in the health system. UnitedHealth is already a dominant player in healthcare data.</p><p>Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com</p><p>Justice Department Sues to Block UnitedHealth's Planned Buy of Change Healthcare</p>",
