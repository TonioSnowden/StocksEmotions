  "text": "<p>   UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it would eliminate copayments and other out-of-pocket charges for patients on some widely used drugs in certain plans next year, including insulin and the anti-overdose treatment naloxone. </p><p>   The move comes as consumer worries about inflation and the economy are high. Democratic lawmakers have been making a renewed push for legislation to curb prescription-drug costs, racing to craft a broader deal before Congress's August break. </p><p>   UnitedHealth announced the initiative during its second-quarter earnings call. The healthcare and health-insurance company on Friday reported profit that beat analysts' expectations, and it raised its earnings guidance for the year. </p><p>   In addition to insulin, used by patients with diabetes, and naloxone, which is administered to people suffering the effects of opioid overdoses, the zero-copay list will include epinephrine, administered to curb allergic reactions; glucagon, used to treat hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar; and albuterol, taken to ease breathing difficulties caused by asthma. </p><p>   For the second quarter, UnitedHealth said revenue rose 13% to $80.3 billion. </p><p>   The company now expects full-year earnings of $20.45 a share to $20.95 a share, up 15 cents on either end from its prior guidance. </p><p>   Profit for the quarter ended June 30 came in at $5.07 billion, or $5.34 a share, compared with $4.27 billion, or $4.46 a share, a year earlier. </p><p></p>",
