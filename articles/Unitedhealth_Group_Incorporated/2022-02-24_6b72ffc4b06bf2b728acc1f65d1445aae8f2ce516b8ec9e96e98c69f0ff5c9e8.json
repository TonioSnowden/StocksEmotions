  "text": "<p>The US Department of Justice has sued to block UnitedHealth's $13bn acquisition of Change Healthcare, in the latest effort by Joe Biden's administration to clamp down on large takeovers.</p> <p>UnitedHealth's health services arm Optum last year set out to buy Change Healthcare, a healthcare insurance technology group. UnitedHealth also owns the largest health insurer in the US. </p> <p>In a lawsuit filed on Thursday seeking to block the deal, the justice department said the transaction would substantially reduce competition in the industry, allowing United “to use its control over Change's technologies to disadvantage its health insurance rivals” by raising their costs and denying them access to innovations.</p> <p>The justice department's concerns about the deal focused on data control. The complaint said that because Change's insurance claim technology was widely used, the merger would give United access to rivals' data. </p> <p>This would “allow United to co-opt its rival insurers' innovations and their competitive strategies and reduce their incentives to pursue those innovations and strategies in the first place,” the department said in the complaint. </p> <p>Doha Mekki, principal deputy assistant attorney-general in the justice department's antitrust division, said the proposed deal “threatens an inflection point in the healthcare industry by giving United control of a critical data highway through which about half of all Americans' health insurance claims pass each year”.</p> <p>The lawsuit comes as the Biden administration has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8893550-fc6c-4301-879d-209aa9323f5b\">toughened its stance on large takeovers</a>, particularly in the sensitive tech and healthcare sectors, and as US and European regulators are increasingly co-ordinating their scrutiny of potentially detrimental deals. </p> <p>Illumina, the world's largest gene sequencing company, is facing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/724a08f2-1e20-49d6-a66e-5d8e2cb9f9f5\">drawn-out probe</a> by regulators into its acquisition of US-based Grail, which screens for early cancer detection. </p> <p>SoftBank's $66bn sale of chipmaker Arm to Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59c0d5f9-ed6a-4de6-a997-f25faed58833\">collapsed</a> this month after regulators in the US, UK and EU raised concerns about the landmark deal. </p> <p>UnitedHealth has benefited in recent years from a rise in healthcare spending and increased collaboration between its insurance arm and services division Optum. The Minnesota-based company has added 2mn health insurance customers since the end of 2020, bringing its total to 50mn customers.</p> <p>UnitedHealth said that combining Change and Optum would increase efficiency and reduce friction in healthcare, producing a better experience and lower costs. </p> <p>“The department's deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the healthcare system. We will defend our case vigorously,” a spokesperson said.</p> <p>The Biden administration has recently appointed Jonathan Kanter to lead the justice department's antitrust division and Lina Khan as chair of the Federal Trade Commission — both of whom have called for stricter measures to curb anti-competitive practices that could stifle competition. </p> <p>Last month, Kanter said that the department would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8b0f1de-b4c2-49da-a8ae-a1eacf89394f\">seek to outright block</a> more deals that could harm consumers rather than pursuing settlements.</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari and Jamie Smyth in New York 2022 'US sues to stop UnitedHealth's $13bn purchase of Change Healthcare' FT.com 24 February.
