  "title": "J&J Vaccine Highly Effective Against Delta Variant in South African Trial; Study finds J&J vaccine has an efficacy of up to 71% against hospitalization from the highly contagious strain",
  "text": "<p>The South African study, known as Sisonke, found that the J&amp;J vaccine has an efficacy of up to 71% against hospitalization from the Delta variant, 67% against hospitalization from the Beta variant and up to 96% against death, according to a presentation of the results Friday. The data hasn't yet been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal.</p><p>\"The vaccine works very well in South Africa and protects against severe disease and death. All the immune responses that we've seen indicate good, immediate and sustained immune response against Delta and we see surprising durability in immune response of up to eight months,\" said Dr. Glenda Gray, one of the study's lead researchers.</p><p>The results are likely to inform a continuing debate about booster doses, coming out against the backdrop of another study that suggested the J&amp;J vaccine might not offer strong protection  against the Delta variant. The San Francisco Department of Public Health and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center said earlier this week they would offer booster doses of shots from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or Moderna Inc. to people who received Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose shot.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration expects to have a strategy on Covid-19 vaccine boosters  by early September that would lay out when and which vaccinated individuals should get the follow-up shots .</p><p>J&amp;J is expected to release data about the efficacy of two doses of its vaccine in the coming weeks.</p><p>When there were breakthrough cases, Dr. Gray said 96% of them were mild. Less than 0.05% of the cases led to severe disease or death in the volunteers. There were two rare blood-clot cases among the healthcare workers in the study, but both fully recovered, she said.</p><p>\"The data are particularly important because it's a study that was done in the most challenging epidemiologic setting, which is a major surge of the Delta variant in Africa,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Dr. Barouch was involved in the development of the J&amp;J vaccine though not the South African trial. \"This study shows that a single dose of the vaccine provides a very high level of protection against severe disease and death.\"</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com </p><p>J&amp;J Vaccine Highly Effective Against Delta Variant in South African Trial</p>",
