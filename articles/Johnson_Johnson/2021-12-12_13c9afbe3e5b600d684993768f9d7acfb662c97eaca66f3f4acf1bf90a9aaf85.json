  "text": "<p>South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa is being treated for mild symptoms of Covid-19 after he tested positive for the virus on Sunday, as the country battles one of the world's first waves of infections caused by the Omicron variant.</p> <p>Ramaphosa, who has been vaccinated, was in “good spirits” in self-isolation in Cape Town and had handed over his duties for the week to David Mabuza, his deputy, South Africa's presidency said in a <a href=\"https://www.thepresidency.gov.za/press-statements/president-ramaphosa-tests-positive-covid-19\">statement</a>.</p> <p>South Africa recorded just over 18,000 new daily cases on Sunday, representing almost 29 per cent of tests coming back positive, after a sharp increase in infections in the weeks since scientists in the country and in Botswana <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a667cf42-dabc-480f-8c0f-ccf5e8d6eb42\">first spotted the Omicron variant</a> in local samples.</p> <p>Ramaphosa's own infection “serves as a caution to all people in the country to be vaccinated and remain vigilant against exposure”, the office of the head of state said. “Vaccination remains the best protection against severe illness and hospitalisation.”</p> <p>Despite signs that Omicron <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e742a4bf-3e72-4551-bf72-df73cb35436f\">evades some immunity</a> and leads to more reinfections, South African scientists and medics <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d315be08-cda0-462b-85ec-811290ad488e\">have drawn hope </a>from relatively low rates of severe cases in hospitals. There have been signs of a slowdown in infections in Gauteng, the country's industrial hub where the first Omicron cases were recorded, but medical officials cautioned that it was still early days. </p> <p>Prior waves in Africa's most industrialised economy are believed to have infected most of the population. South Africa has also made relative progress with getting jabs to older people compared with its overall rollout, which has fully vaccinated just less than 38 per cent of adults</p> <p>Ramaphosa was vaccinated with Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot jab in February. He was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af929941-7c02-415a-a692-bf8443ede58a\">one of the first</a> people in South Africa to receive a Covid vaccine, as part of an effort to build confidence in the shots. Initial supply shortages affecting the early rollout have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47fa3d7c-e98a-4bac-ac54-25998b39c449\">given way to problems</a> with distributing doses and dispelling fears about side-effects.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, Ramaphosa had attended a state memorial service in Cape Town for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f82ca263-9e4c-4c78-84a7-673d389b58e7\">FW de Klerk</a>, the last apartheid president and deputy to Nelson Mandela in the country's first democratic government, who died last month. Ramaphosa and other attendees wore masks, as is mandatory in public in South Africa.</p> <p>Ramaphosa had tested negative for the virus on December 8, when he returned from a trip to several West African countries, his office said.</p> <p>South Africa's health product regulator has approved the country's first mass boosters, using only the Pfizer jab, the other vaccine in wide use locally. Rollout of third Pfizer doses and approval for J&amp;J booster shots are expected early next year.</p><p>Source: Joseph Cotterill in Johannesburg 2021 'South Africa's leader Cyril Ramaphosa tests positive for Covid' FT.com 12 December.
