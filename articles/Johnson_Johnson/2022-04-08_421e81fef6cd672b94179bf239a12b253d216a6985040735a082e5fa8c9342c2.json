  "title": "Asbestos Victims Hit With $100 Daily Fine in Georgia-Pacific Unit's Bankruptcy; A bankruptcy judge says claimants must disclose to a Georgia-Pacific affiliate their settlements with other asbestos defendants",
  "text": "<p>Each claimant will be liable for a $100 daily fine until the information is supplied, according to a civil-contempt order issued Wednesday. The contempt finding came at the request of a bankrupt spinoff of Koch's Georgia-Pacific LLC that was formed in 2017 to carry the company's asbestos-related liabilities into chapter 11.</p><p>The company has said it is building evidence that it overpaid to settle asbestos claims in the past because plaintiffs' lawyers concealed other alleged sources of their clients' exposure.</p><p>Some law firms have defied the company's demands for information, saying they are prohibited from disclosing the details of clients' confidential settlements with third parties and offering only to provide aggregate, anonymized figures.</p><p>\"Instead of fulfilling their obligations to the victims, Georgia-Pacific asked the court to sanction sick, dying and even dead Americans for refusing to give up their constitutional rights to due process and privacy,\" said Jonathan Ruckdeschel, an asbestos victims' lawyer.</p><p>Representatives for the bankrupt Georgia-Pacific spinoff, Bestwall LLC, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Judge Beyer had found claimants in contempt in February but held off on issuing monetary sanctions to give them and their law firms time to come into compliance with her directive. On Wednesday, she found that while some had, others \"are continuing to thumb their nose at this court's order.\"</p><p>\"It's especially troubling and frustrating to me that the noncompliance is not random but rather it is on a law-firm-by-law-firm basis, which is an indication that those firms must be instructing their clients not to comply,\" she said.</p><p>Bestwall has said it wants the information to aid in an estimation of its asbestos liability in a special chapter 11 proceeding meant to ballpark the company's financial obligations to victims of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related ailments.</p><p>To get to a number, the court is expected to evaluate how much the company had historically paid to settle asbestos claims against it in the decades before the bankruptcy filing.</p><p>Bestwall has said the information is critical to show that other companies were responsible for exposing claimants to asbestos, lowering Bestwall's share of liability to them or their surviving family members. It has claimed to have evidence that it overpaid asbestos claims in the past because plaintiffs' lawyers concealed that they had filed claims against multiple companies for asbestos exposure on behalf of the same clients.</p><p>Under the judge's ruling, claimants are obligated to disclose their aggregate recoveries from tort defendants and any of the dozens of compensation trusts established by bankrupt asbestos manufacturers since the 1980s. Claim forms submitted to the trusts, which are normally kept confidential, are also covered by the court order.</p><p>Bestwall has justified its requests by pointing to the chapter 11 case of Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC, which convinced a bankruptcy court in 2014 that some plaintiffs' lawyers had systematically withheld evidence that clients were exposed to asbestos from other sources.</p><p>Bestwall was created using a Texas restructuring law to take on its affiliate's asbestos liabilities and resolve them through bankruptcy. Its chapter 11 filing froze roughly 64,000 asbestos lawsuits and has kept them from reaching juries.</p><p>Ireland's Trane Technologies PLC, France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA, and Johnson &amp; Johnson have since used the same tactic to ferry asbestos-related liabilities in chapter 11. That has allowed the companies—all advised by the same law firm, Jones Day—to access the benefits of chapter 11 without placing valuable business assets in bankruptcy.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
