  "title": "Johnson & Johnson's Breakup: What to Know; Maker of products including Tylenol and a Covid-19 vaccine is separating its consumer-health unit from its pharmaceutical and medical-device businesses",
  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to split off its consumer-health business, the home of household staples like Band-Aids, Tylenol and Johnson's Baby Powder.</p><p>The result, in 18 months to two years, will be a company selling prescription drugs and medical devices under the J&amp;J name, and a separate firm selling over-the-counter medicines, skin products and other consumer-health goods.</p><p>J&amp;J said it still must work out the details of the separation. Here is what we know about the planned split:</p><p>What is Johnson &amp; Johnson doing?</p><p>The world's biggest health-products company is breaking up into two publicly traded companies. The one keeping the J&amp;J name will sell prescription drugs like Darzalex prostate-cancer treatment and Uptravi for pulmonary-arterial hypertension. It will also sell hip-replacement, trauma-surgery and other medical devices. The new company will be fashioned from the consumer-health business that fills our medicine chests and shower caddies. J&amp;J's consumer-health unit is the home to Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol medicines and Johnson's Baby Powder, as well as other well-known brands like Aveeno, Neutrogena and Motrin.</p><p>Why is J&amp;J breaking up?</p><p>The businesses have grown apart, and they could perform better than they are as separate companies with their own management, customers and shareholders, J&amp;J executives told The Wall Street Journal. \"This really unlocks the potential of our consumer business,\" while also allowing the pharmaceutical and medical-device company to focus its investments and efforts, J&amp;J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said in an interview.</p><p>The healthcare business has changed a lot since J&amp;J introduced medicated patches—called kidney plasters—and indigestion tablets more than a century ago. Over the decades, drugs were divided by whether they required a doctor's prescription or could be sold over the counter directly to patients. And while the consumer products advanced, prescription drugs and medical devices grew far more complex and tackled increasingly difficult-to-treat diseases. Today, researchers are developing therapies that can replace a defective, disease-causing gene, for instance, and robotic surgical tools.</p><p>Meanwhile, the markets for the products have also diverged. Pharmaceuticals and medical devices are riskier to develop but promise faster sales growth and higher returns. Prescription drugs and medical devices are tightly regulated, used by doctors and hospitals, and paid by health insurers. The pharmaceuticals business is J&amp;J's fastest-growing. The consumer business, which is slower-growing and lower-margin, relies heavily on marketing—increasingly endorsements from celebrities. And products are sold directly to consumers, often via e-commerce websites.</p><p>\"The type of issues that personal-health address are not the same as the difficult diseases that pharmaceuticals and medical devices are pursuing,\" said Joaquin Duato, vice chairman of J&amp;J's executive committee who will become chief executive in January and eventually helm the pharmaceutical and medical-device company.</p><p>J&amp;J said lawsuits alleging that use of Johnson's Baby Powder caused cancer didn't play a role in the decision. J&amp;J has said its talc-containing baby powder is safe, doesn't contain asbestos and doesn't cause cancer, but it recently created a new subsidiary and placed it in bankruptcy to resolve the talc claims quickly.</p><p>What does J&amp;J's consumer business sell?</p><p>Many products that we grew up using. It is behind Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol and Johnson's Baby Powder. It also sells other well-known brands, like Aveeno and Neutrogena skin-care products, Neosporin antibiotic ointment and Zyrtec allergy pills. The business is, for many people, their direct connection to J&amp;J. The decision, in 1982, to pull all Tylenol from store shelves during a safety scare endeared J&amp;J to many consumers, while recalls of the medicine and other over-the-counter products in 2009 and 2010 tarnished the company's reputation among some. In recent years the consumer business has expanded globally and into newer brands, like Zarbee's, which makes cough syrup, vitamins and probiotics. J&amp;J expects to have about $15 billion in sales this year.</p><p>What are J&amp;J's pharmaceutical and medical-device businesses?</p><p>They develop and sell advanced prescription drugs and medical devices. J&amp;J projects their sales could approach $80 billion this year. The prescription-drug unit, which goes by the name Janssen, may be best known now for J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine. It is one of three authorized for use in the U.S. The company's other therapies include prostate-cancer medication Darzalex, antipsychotic Invega Sustenna and psoriasis treatment Stelara. J&amp;J's medical-device unit sells products under names like Biosense Webster, Ethicon and DePuy Synthes. Its products include J&amp;J contact lenses and the Actis hip-replacement system, as well as many tools and other equipment used by surgeons.</p><p>Why keep pharmaceuticals and devices together?</p><p>J&amp;J executives said the businesses are complementary. Each is based on development of new products using cutting-edge science, are tightly regulated, need support from doctors and hospitals, and are paid by health insurers. Both have riskier profiles than the consumer business but offer the promise of higher returns. Another reason executives cited for keeping the companies together is the development of combination devices and drugs. One in the works would identify lung tumors and then target them with a cancer therapy. Another experimental product aims to treat bladder-cancer patients using a device that delivers a drug.</p><p>What are the details of the split?</p><p>While J&amp;J has decided to break up, it hasn't worked out many details, including the name of the new consumer company and who will lead it. J&amp;J said it plans to structure the transaction to be tax-free, but will have to decide on the form the separation will take, though it is leaning toward spinning out the consumer unit and holding a stock offering. \"Our preference is a capital-markets transaction, but there are a couple of cards that have to be turned over, and sometimes the market dictates what is the most advantageous thing to do,\" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.</p><p>Write to Jonathan D.
