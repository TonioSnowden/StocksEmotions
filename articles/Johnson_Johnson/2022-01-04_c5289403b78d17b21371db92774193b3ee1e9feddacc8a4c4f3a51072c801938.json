  "title": "Pfizer Covid-19 Booster Cleared for Ages 12 to 15",
  "text": "<p>The agency also on Monday cleared a third dose for certain 5- to 11-year-olds with compromised immune systems.</p><p>The new guidance on boosters comes as the seven-day average of daily reported Covid-19 cases in the U.S. reached a pandemic record 403,385 on Sunday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. The fresh peak arrived even as most states paused reporting during the New Year's holiday weekend, meaning this week is likely to see a surge in reports of cases as states catch up.</p><p>Hospitalizations driven by the Omicron surge remain far below earlier peaks of the virus. Confirmed or suspected hospitalized Covid-19 cases reached a seven-day average of 97,855 on Monday, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, up 41% in the past two weeks but below both the pandemic peak of 137,510 on Jan. 10, 2021, and the smaller peak of 102,967 on Sept. 4, 2021, during the Delta surge.</p><p>Hospitalizations in New York state rose but remain less than half of their peak level in 2020. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said that based on a review of recent data, \"we can say with certainty, that the cases are not presenting themselves as severely as they could have or as we had feared. That is the silver lining.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, in Washington, the top doctor for Congress and the Supreme Court sent a letter Monday to members and staff warning of a surge of cases in the Capitol. Brian P. Monahan wrote that the Capitol testing center had seen a rise in the seven-day rate of positives from less than 1% to more than 13%, amid a surge of cases in the D.C. metropolitan area.</p><p>The Omicron surge comes as schools returning from holiday break tried to figure out how to stay open while reducing the spread of the highly contagious variant. Health authorities have been urging people to get a booster shot, citing early research indicating it is needed to maintain strong protection against Omicron.</p><p>\"With the current wave of the Omicron variant, it's critical that we continue to take effective, lifesaving preventative measures such as primary vaccination and boosters, mask wearing and social distancing,\" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said.</p><p>A panel of vaccine experts advising the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to meet Wednesday to discuss the FDA's authorization. Many doctor's offices, schools and other vaccination sites could start providing the shots to adolescents if the panel and then the CDC director sign off.</p><p>There should be sufficient supply because the adolescents get the same dose already in use.</p><p>The FDA had authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech booster for people as young as 16 but not younger adolescents, who have been able to get vaccinated for more than six months, the time when some studies indicate people's antibody levels drop.</p><p>The additional dose is the same as the previous two doses, 30 micrograms.</p><p>\"We continue to believe that broad use of boosters is essential to preserving a high level of protection against this disease and reducing the rate of hospitalizations,\" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said.</p><p>Children and adolescents are less likely than adults to become infected with Covid-19, and when they do, they tend to experience milder symptoms. Yet some have become hospitalized and in rare instances have died.</p><p>Some hospitals and health authorities have reported that pediatric hospitalizations have risen as Omicron has spread.</p><p>About 1.9 million children 12 to 15 have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to the CDC.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech shot is cleared for use in the U.S. in children as young as 5.</p><p>At least 16 million children 12 to 17 have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine since its authorization in May, the CDC said.</p><p>While some parents rushed to get their children vaccinated, others have held back, partly because of concerns about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>One concern among some parents is the risk of heart-related conditions, including myocarditis, especially in young men.</p><p>Health experts have said the myocarditis risk is low in children who are vaccinated and less than the risk if a child got Covid-19.</p><p>The FDA said its decision to expand boosters to 12- to 15-year-olds followed a review of real-world data from Israel, including safety data from about 6,300 adolescents who received an additional dose five months after their second shot. The data didn't show any new safety concerns or detect new cases of myocarditis, the agency said.</p><p>The risk of teens contracting myocarditis after the third dose has been found to be about one-third lower than the risk after a second dose, said Peter Marks, who heads the FDA's vaccines center. And even when people who received messenger-RNA vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech's developed the heart condition, he said, the inflammation has been found to be mild and the median hospital stay was one day.</p><p>\"We're not seeing long-lasting effects,\" he said, noting that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.</p><p>Under the FDA's action, children with compromised immune systems age 5 to 11 can get the third dose as soon as four weeks after the second.</p><p>The additional dose should allow for \"maximum protection\" in certain immunocompromised children, including those who have received organ transplants, according to the FDA.</p><p>The FDA has also authorized boosters from Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The agency didn't change the time that should lapse before getting an extra dose of one of those shots.</p><p>The time between a primary vaccination series and booster for people who initially received Moderna's vaccine remains six months, while it remains two months for people whose primary series was from J&amp;J. Both vaccines are cleared for use in people 18 years and older.</p><p>---</p><p>Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
