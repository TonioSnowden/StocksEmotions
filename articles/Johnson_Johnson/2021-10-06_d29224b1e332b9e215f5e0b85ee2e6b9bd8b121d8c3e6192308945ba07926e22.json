The Facebook founder and chief executive wrote: “Most of us just don't recognise the false picture of the company that is being painted.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Experts say one of the reforms most likely to gain Congressional approval is an expansion to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act to make it illegal for companies to collect personal information on under-13s without their parents' consent. </p> <p>Another is a move to limit Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which means social media companies cannot be sued for content which users post on their platforms, even if they moderate it.</p> <h1>Read more</h1> <p><strong>Marietje Schaake: </strong>US tech needs to do a great deal better <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28400864-99b0-492d-a353-48de27197674\">when it comes to democracy</a>, argues the international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center.</p> <p><strong>Lex:</strong> Investors should take Frances Haugen's allegations that Facebook mislead investors and advertisers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3efd0b49-0dc3-41c5-b4b5-1f553d7bbc23\">seriously</a>.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
