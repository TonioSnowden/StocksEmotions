  "title": "Aaron Rodgers Attacks NFL and 'Woke Mob' of Critics in Defending His Unvaccinated Status; The star quarterback, who had previously said he was \"immunized,\" spoke out for the first time about his decision to not get vaccinated in an explosive interview",
  "text": "<p>He skewered the NFL's health and safety measures for preventing the spread of the coronavirus and lambasted the public health establishment's pandemic analysis, while labeling himself a \"critical thinker.\"</p><p>Rodgers said his decision to not receive one of the three vaccines approved in the U.S. was based on extensive research about what was best for his body. He claimed that he was allergic to the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, and did not trust the one-shot vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson. He did not specify his allergy.</p><p>\"I made a choice that was in my best interest,\" he said.</p><p>He later added: \"The right is gonna champion me, and the left is gonna cancel me. And the whole time, I don't give a shit about either of them. Politics is a total sham.\"</p><p>Rodgers' comments represent an extraordinary pushback to the health protocols that sports implemented to keep playing during the pandemic. They also make Rodgers, the league's reigning Most Valuable Player, the most prominent athlete to cast doubt on vaccines and question the scientific establishment. While the overwhelming majority of professional athletes in major American sports leagues are vaccinated, Rodgers and Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving are high-profile exceptions whose refusals to get the shot have placed them at the center of the nation's culture wars.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people older than 5 years old get vaccinated.</p><p>Rodgers became the center of controversy earlier this week when he tested positive for Covid-19 and was placed into the league's protocols for unvaccinated players. That came after he was asked earlier in the year if he were vaccinated, to which he replied: \"Yeah, I'm immunized.\"</p><p>Rodgers said on Friday he believed he was immunized because of his conversations with \"healers\" rooted in holistic and homeopathic medicine, saying they worked to stimulate his immune system. He said he had previously filed an appeal to the NFL to count him as vaccinated, but the league denied it.</p><p>Rodgers said that he contacted his \"now-good friend\" Joe Rogan, the podcaster who has tested positive for Covid-19, and followed the course of treatment that he recommended, which included monoclonal antibodies and ivermectin, the antiparasitic drug that federal health regulators have warned against using.</p><p>Rodgers, who was subject to daily tests under the NFL's protocols for unvaccinated players, said that his first symptoms appeared on Tuesday night before he tested positive on Wednesday. He remained symptomatic on Thursday and \"didn't feel great,\" but he said he was improving by Friday.</p><p>He will miss the Packers' showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday—he said he felt healthy enough to play if he were allowed—and remains ineligible to return until at least the day before Green Bay hosts the Seattle Seahawks next Sunday.</p><p>While Rodgers repeatedly blamed the media for its efforts to \"out and shame\" unvaccinated athletes, he also took direct aim at the NFL, claiming that the health and safety policies the league has implemented to prevent the spread of the virus were not rooted in science. He took particular aim at the league's protocols that treat vaccinated and unvaccinated players differently.</p><p>Unvaccinated players, such as Rodgers, have to test daily and abide by other strict requirements like mask-wearing while in the facility in order to account for the fact that unvaccinated people are more susceptible to both catching and spreading the virus. Vaccinated players, meanwhile, only have to test once a week and face looser rules in a number of other facets.</p><p>The NFL did not have an immediate comment on Rodgers's remarks.</p><p>He decided to explain his views on the Covid-19 vaccines for the first time because of the response to his positive test and misleading public statement about his vaccination status, he said to open the interview.</p><p>\"I realize I'm in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now, so before my final nail gets put in my cancel-culture casket, I think I'd like to set the record straight on so many of the blatant lies out there,\" Rodgers said.</p><p>Write to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com and Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com</p><p>Aaron Rodgers Attacks NFL and 'Woke Mob' of Critics in Defending His Unvaccinated Status</p>",
