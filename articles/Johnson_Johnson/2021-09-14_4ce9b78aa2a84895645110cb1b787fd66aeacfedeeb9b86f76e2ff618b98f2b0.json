  "title": "Business News: Skin-Care Industry Is Divided Over Asian Creams",
  "text": "<p>The word that has divided global companies consists of two Chinese characters that are used in writing Japanese -- the first meaning \"beautiful\" and the second \"white.\" In Japanese, the two together are pronounced \"bihaku.\" The characters or the word bihaku in English letters appear on many skin creams in Asia.</p><p>Bihaku products accounted for more than $2 billion in sales in Japan in the year ended March 2021, according to an estimate by TPC Marketing Research Corp. The products are sold in Greater China, South Korea and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Unilever told The Wall Street Journal it is removing \"bihaku\" and \"white\" from products it sells in Japan under the brand name Pond's as part of a global policy to eliminate words that suggest fairer skin is better. The changes are beginning this month, although the company said some products already in distribution channels may still contain the discontinued words.</p><p>Last year, Unilever said it would rename its South Asia-focused Fair &amp; Lovely brand, one of its top-selling personal-care lines. It is now called Glow &amp; Lovely and the company's marketing emphasizes it \"has never been, and is not, a skin bleaching cream.\"</p><p>\"We are fully committed to having a global portfolio of skin care brands that is inclusive and cares for all skin tones,\" the company said in an email statement last month.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson and L'Oreal SA's Lancome, by contrast, said they were keeping bihaku on their products. They said they didn't think consumers interpreted \"beautiful white\" to mean that the creams would make the skin whiter.</p><p>Bihaku products are sold by Japanese brand Dr. Ci:Labo, which was acquired by J&amp;J in 2019. \"As a brand founded by a dermatologist, Dr. Ci:Labo created the Bihaku range for those looking to prevent uneven skin tone and dullness concerns,\" a J&amp;J spokesman said.</p><p>Lancome has a \"Bihaku Care\" line that offers products labeled \"Absolue White Aura,\" using a French version of the word \"absolute.\" A spokeswoman said the characters in bihaku were associated with \"translucence and inner radiance,\" not a lightening of skin tone.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
