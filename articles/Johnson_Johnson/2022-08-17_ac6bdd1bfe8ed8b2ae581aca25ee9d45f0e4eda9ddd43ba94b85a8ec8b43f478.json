  "title": "The Never-Ending Opioid Raid; Judge Polster orders a $650 million payday for trial lawyers and politicians.",
  "text": "<p>To expedite a settlement, he called for a bellwether trial against the three large pharmacy chains to litigate claims by the two counties. They say the pharmacies should have known that opioids they dispensed would be abused, no matter that state medical and pharmacy boards have threatened to discipline pharmacists who refuse to fill legal prescriptions.</p><p>As we've written, Judge Polster repeatedly bent the federal rules of civil procedure and evidence to assist the trial lawyers. A jury in November held the pharmacies liable for creating a public nuisance, and the judge is now ordering them to pay what amounts to about $1,500 per person in each county.</p><p>While this is less than the $2 billion the counties sought, plaintiffs always shoot for the stars and hope to land on the moon. In this case they made it to Mars. If defendants are required to pay a similar amount in all 3,000 or so other opioid cases, they could be on the hook for more than $1 trillion. Pharmacies could appeal the verdict, but Judge Polster is betting they'll choose to cut smaller checks to settle the other cases, as some companies have done.</p><p>Rite Aid this summer paid $10.5 million to settle lawsuits by three counties in the multi-district litigation. Johnson &amp; Johnson and three distributors last summer agreed to pay $26 billion to settle thousands of others. The lawsuits transfer wealth from private business to governments and the trial bar, and the costs will invariably be passed onto customers.</p><p>Politicians howl about high drug prices. How about looking in the mirror?</p><p>The Never-Ending Opioid Raid</p>",
