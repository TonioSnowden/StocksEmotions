  "title": "New Covid-19 Booster Shots for This Fall: What to Know; The CDC recommends the shots, which are rolling out across the country",
  "text": "<p>Recently, the FDA expanded eligibility for the new boosters to certain children as young as 6 months old.</p><p>White House officials said they plan to recommend that people get Covid-19 boosters once a year, similar to the flu vaccine, starting with the new shots. In November, the Biden administration said it would launch a campaign to lift lackluster booster rates through the end of the year.</p><p>The new shots were introduced to bolster people's protection against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which appear to evade some of the protection provided by the original vaccines. \"At some point, the virus is divergent enough from the strain for which the vaccine was designed that you need to consider a modified design,\" said Sten Vermund, professor of public health and pediatrics at Yale School of Public Health.</p><p>Here is what we know about the new booster shots:</p><p>What boosters are available?</p><p>The FDA authorized two modified booster shots: one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. Both use messenger RNA, or mRNA, the gene-based technology used in their original Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>There is also an authorized booster from Novavax Inc. that targets the ancestral strain of Covid-19 and is protein-based, which might appeal to some of the people who have been reluctant to receive the two leading Covid-19 vaccines. The Novavax booster is authorized for people for whom an mRNA booster shot isn't accessible or clinically appropriate, or people who prefer the Novavax shot.</p><p>How are the new boosters different from the old ones?</p><p>The new booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer have two main targets, making them \"bivalent\" vaccines, whereas the original vaccines and boosters had one target. One of the targets in the new booster shots is the original coronavirus strain that was predominant in 2020—the same strain targeted by the original vaccines and boosters.</p><p>The second target is a component of the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. These subvariants share an identical \"spike\" protein that has a different genetic makeup than the spike protein in the original virus.</p><p>The new booster shots contain genetic instructions for human cells to produce copies of the BA.4 and BA.5 spike protein, which in turn sets off an immune response that may have stronger neutralizing activity against these subvariants than the original vaccines.</p><p>The booster from Novavax, however, targets the ancestral, or original strain. The company is working on a modified vaccine that would better target BA.5 and could be available by the end of the year. </p><p>New boosters have two targets, a component of the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original coronavirus strain targeted by vaccines from Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pfizer-BioNTech. PHOTO: Landon Speers for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>How do we know if they are safe and effective?</p><p>The FDA said it based its authorization on available evidence, including the real-world safety and effectiveness of the original vaccines, and the performance in human studies of earlier iterations of booster shots targeting the original Omicron strain. It also looked at data from testing the modified boosters in mice. The FDA doesn't have the full results of human studies of the modified boosters by Moderna and Pfizer.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech said on Nov. 4 that preliminary results from a study of their modified booster shot in people showed that it generated an immune response in people 55 years and older four times higher one month after vaccination than people who received an original booster. The companies also said antibody levels were higher than pre-booster levels in people 18 to 55 years who got the new bivalent shot, though the companies didn't report a control group for comparison. The vaccines were also found to work safely, according to Pfizer and BioNTech.</p><p>In mid-November, Moderna said first data from a company-sponsored study found their booster generated a strong immune response in people against the Omicron subvariants. People who received the modified booster had more than five times the neutralizing antibodies against BA.4 and BA.5 than people who received the company's original booster, according to Moderna.</p><p>There is still limited data about how much protection the updated boosters provide against infection, symptomatic Covid-19, severe disease or death.</p><p>In contrast, the FDA authorized the original Covid-19 vaccines in late 2020 after their safety and effectiveness were tested in studies of tens of thousands of people. Health officials say authorizing the new boosters without large new clinical trials is similar to the approval process for annual updates to seasonal flu shots.</p><p>\"These updated boosters meet the FDA's rigorous standards and are expected to help restore immune protection against Covid-19,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a briefing.</p><p>For the Novavax booster, the FDA based its decision on clinical trial data showing that Novavax's booster increased antibodies both in patients who earlier received Novavax primary shots or who received messenger RNA shots.</p><p>Should I get a booster this fall?</p><p>The CDC recommends all eligible people receive the new boosters. The FDA says all adults 18 and older who previously received at least a primary vaccination (two doses of an mRNA or protein vaccine, or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine) may receive a modified booster shot from either Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech at least two months after primary or booster vaccination. Previously vaccinated adolescents 12 and older may receive a Pfizer/BioNTech booster shot.</p><p>The booster from Novavax is only authorized for people 18 and older who have completed a primary vaccination series.</p><p>Can my child get the new booster?</p><p>The FDA in December expanded eligibility for Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's updated boosters to certain children as young as 6 months old. Children who got Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine can get the updated booster two months after completing a primary series, which consists of two doses. Children who haven't received their third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech three-dose shot can get the booster. Those who have completed the three-dose series of Pfizer-BioNTech aren't eligible for the updated booster at this time.</p><p>The agency had previously authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech booster for children as young as 5 years old, as well as the Moderna booster for children 6 years and older. These children become eligible for the booster shot two months after completing their primary series or a prior booster dose.</p><p>Where can I get a booster shot?</p><p>Pharmacies, hospitals, doctors' offices and other sites that already administered Covid-19 vaccines have started offering the new booster shots.</p><p>What if I have already had a primary vaccination and at least one booster?</p><p>Experts say that even if you have already gotten at least one original booster shot, you should still get the new booster shot if you are eligible and it has been at least two months since your last shot. \"Now their immunity can be enhanced by specific immunity to emerging circulating variants,\" Dr. Vermund said. \"So it can only do them good.\"</p><p>When should I get a booster shot if I recently got Covid-19?</p><p>The CDC has previously said that people with known current infections should defer vaccination, including the original booster shots, until recovery from the infection. The CDC also has said people who recently had Covid-19 may consider delaying a Covid-19 shot by three months.</p><p>Studies have shown that increased time between infection and vaccination may improve the immune response to vaccination, the CDC said. The agency hasn't yet specified whether these guidelines apply to the new, modified boosters. Dr. Vermund said he recommends people wait at least a month after infection before getting a booster. </p><p>New booster shots targeting Omicron subvariants of the coronavirus are authorized for some who have received their first series of Covid-19 vaccination. PHOTO: Amir Hamja for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Will I have a choice between the original boosters and the modified ones?</p><p>No. The FDA said the original mRNA booster shots from Pfizer and Moderna are no longer authorized for anyone who is eligible for the shots. \"We want to make sure that adults and adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that's why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Novavax didn't have an authorized booster shot before October.</p><p>Can I mix and match boosters?</p><p>People 6 and older may get an updated booster from a different manufacturer than they got for their primary series, as long as it is the updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shot. Five-year-olds may get the updated Pfizer-BioNTech booster regardless of which vaccine they received for their primary series.</p><p>People 18 years and older who have completed a primary vaccination series can also mix and match with the Novavax booster.</p><p>—Will Feuer, Brianna Abbott, Jared S.
