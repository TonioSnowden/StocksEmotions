  "title": "The New Omicron Covid-19 Variant: What to Know; The coronavirus variant also known as B.1.1.529 has more than 30 mutations on the spike protein, the structure that is a main target of many current Covid-19 vaccines",
  "text": "<p>The first known case in the U.S. was identified in a person in California who recently returned from South Africa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p><p>The CDC said Wednesday that the fully vaccinated traveler, who returned to California on Nov. 22, has mild Covid-19 symptoms that are improving. The person has been self-quarantining since testing positive, and all known contacts have so far tested negative for the variant, the CDC said.</p><p>What has the WHO said about the Omicron variant?</p><p>The World Health Organization said there was preliminary evidence that the variant, which was first detected on Nov. 9, might pose a greater risk of people falling ill with Covid-19 for a second time. It also said the variant might be more transmissible than other strains of the coronavirus, citing Omicron's rapid spread in South Africa during the past few weeks. The WHO said Sunday that at this stage there is no evidence to say whether this variant will cause milder or more severe illness than previous strains.</p><p>The agency has asked health authorities around the world to examine more positive test samples to see whether Omicron was already spreading in other places.</p><p>On Wednesday, the WHO said that it had reports of Omicron producing cases of disease that ranged from mild to severe, but it was still too early to say whether the variant was more dangerous than older versions of the virus.</p><p>Why are scientists concerned?</p><p>Omicron has an unusually large number of mutations: around 50, including more than 30 on the spike protein, the structure that the virus uses to attach to human cells and the main target of many current Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>Viruses mutate all the time as they replicate, and most mutations make no difference to how the virus operates. But in some cases, they can make a virus spread faster or improve its ability to evade the body's immune system or vaccines.</p><p>The mutations found in Omicron include some that have been detected before and some that haven't. Some of the known mutations have made other variants more transmissible or better able to evade parts of the immune response prompted by vaccination or a previous Covid-19 infection. Scientists are also worried by the rapid increase of cases in South Africa since the strain was first detected.</p><p>How effective are existing Covid-19 vaccines, past infection and treatments against the Omicron variant?</p><p>No one knows for sure. Scientists and vaccine makers are striving to find out, testing Omicron against samples taken from people who have had the vaccine or recovered from Covid-19.</p><p>On Thursday, scientists in South Africa, where the most cases have so far been detected, said they were seeing a rise in the number of people infected with Omicron who had already had Covid-19, suggesting that the new variant was able to circumvent antibodies produced during a past infection. The ability to reinfect is something they say they didn't see with previous variants of the coronavirus. However, the scientists said that past infection and vaccines should be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalization even if protection against infection itself was diminished by Omicron.</p><p>Results on treatments are early and mixed. Initial laboratory studies suggest that a Covid-19 antibody treatment developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Vir Biotechnology Inc. is effective against the Omicron variant, the companies said Thursday.</p><p>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said on Tuesday preliminary tests indicate its Covid-19 antibody-drug cocktail loses effectiveness against Omicron.</p><p>Preliminary tests indicate the Covid-19 antibody-drug cocktail from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. loses effectiveness against Omicron, the company said Tuesday, a sign that some products in animportant class of therapies might need modifying if the new strain becomes widespread.</p><p>President Biden said Monday that his administration was working with officials at Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters in case they are needed to combat the Omicron variant.</p><p>Germany's BioNTech SE, which developed one of the most commonly used Covid-19 vaccines together with Pfizer, said it would take about two weeks to establish whether the new variant renders its shot less effective.</p><p>If needed, a BioNTech spokeswoman said, the companies could produce a new vaccine adjusted to any variant within six weeks and ship initial batches within 100 days.</p><p>Moderna has also started working on a booster vaccine candidate targeting Omicron. In addition, it said it was testing whether two vaccine candidates targeted at other variants it currently has in clinical trials provide protection against Omicron. The company's CEO told the Financial Times that he predicted a \"material drop\" in the effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant of the virus. \"I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data,\" St√©phane Bancel was reported as saying.</p><p>Where else has Omicron been identified?</p><p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said the variant has been identified in over 30 countries, including the U.S., as of Thursday. The variant was first identified in southern Africa and has since been found in the U.K., Italy, Australia, Japan, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Brazil and Hong Kong among others.</p><p>In some cases, the variant's appearance isn't linked to travel to southern Africa.</p><p>What is the significance of a 'variant of concern'?</p><p>The WHO designated the strain a \"variant of concern,\" formally alerting health authorities around the world to the extra risks it appears to carry. To qualify as a variant of concern, a new virus strain has to be proved to be more contagious, lead to more serious illness or decrease the effectiveness of public-health measures, Covid-19 tests, treatments or vaccines.</p><p>Other variants of concern include the Delta variant, which is now dominant world-wide, and the Alpha variant, which drove a deadly wave of infections across Europe and the U.S. last winter and spring.</p><p>Why 'Omicron'?</p><p>The WHO is designating important coronavirus variants after letters of the Greek alphabet. Omicron is the 15th letter.</p><p>How did scientists detect it?</p><p>The first virus sample identified as containing the Omicron variant came in November from a person in Botswana, which borders South Africa. Soon afterward, scientists in Hong Kong detected the variant in a traveler who had arrived from South Africa, and Omicron started showing up in samples from South Africa's Gauteng province.</p><p>In contrast to most other prominent variants, which can be detected only through time-consuming and costly genome sequencing, the potential presence of Omicron also gets flagged in some of the commonly used polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests. That makes it easier to track and is one of the reasons that South African scientists were able to pick up on its rapid spread in the country so quickly and confirm it with genomic sequencing.</p><p>What symptoms are associated with the Omicron variant?</p><p>Because Omicron was discovered so recently, it is too early to say whether it leads to symptoms that are different from infections caused by other strains or make patients less or more sick. Early anecdotal evidence from doctors treating patients with the variant is unlikely to give a true picture of the impact on patients who are older or more vulnerable to the disease, Jenny Harries, chief executive of the U.K.'s Health Security Agency told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday.</p><p>What is being done to control Omicron's spread?</p><p>Governments around the globe, including the U.S., have restricted travel from southern Africa, where most known cases of Omicron originated, although experts are divided over how well travel bans stop a new variant from moving around.</p><p>President Biden plans to tighten up Covid-19 testing timelines for travelers entering the U.S. and extend a mask mandate on airplanes and other public transportation.</p><p>International travelers coming to the U.S. will have to test within a day of departure, regardless of vaccination status, rather than the 72 hours currently required for vaccinated travelers, under new protocols early next week, senior administration officials said Thursday. The new testing rules will apply both to U.S. citizens and foreign nationals entering the country.</p><p>Israel said over the weekend that it would bar the entry of all foreigners into the country for two weeks.</p><p>Japan said from Tuesday it would close its borders to foreigners, including business travelers and foreign students, until the end of the year.</p><p>Australia said it would postpone plans to allow students and skilled migrants to enter the country until Dec. 15. Singapore said Sunday that it would delay quarantine-free travel lanes for several Middle Eastern countries because they were travel nodes for some of the affected countries in southern Africa.</p><p>Passengers entering Singapore on vaccinated travel lanes will also be required to take antigen rapid tests three and seven days after their arrival. Those transiting through the city state must obtain a negative result from a predeparture test, while those entering must take a PCR test on arrival.</p><p>Arrivals to the U.K. must now self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test taken by the end of the second day after arrival.</p><p>Ireland from Friday will require overseas passengers who are fully vaccinated or have proof of recovery from Covid-19 to provide a negative PCR test result to enter the country.</p><p>Write to Gabriele Steinhauser at Gabriele.Steinhauser@wsj.com and Joanna Sugden at joanna.sugden@wsj.com</p><p>The New Omicron Covid-19 Variant: What to Know</p>",
