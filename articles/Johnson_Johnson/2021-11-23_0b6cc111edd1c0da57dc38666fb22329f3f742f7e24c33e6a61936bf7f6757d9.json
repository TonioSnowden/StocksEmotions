  "title": "Mallinckrodt Drug Purchasers Denied Probe of Chapter 11 Asbestos Votes; A creditor group unhappy with the drug company's pricing wanted claims and votes related to asbestos exposure thrown out",
  "text": "<p>Mallinckrodt turned to bankruptcy in 2020 to resolve a rising number of lawsuits over the sale of opioid products along with antitrust claims over pricing for its H.P. Acthar Gel drug, used to treat infantile spasms, multiple sclerosis and other conditions. Dublin-based Mallinckrodt also faced more than 11,700 asbestos-related lawsuits, mostly related to legacy operations of predecessor companies.</p><p>Judge Dorsey ruled against a request made last month by employers and others alleging they overpaid for Acthar treatments.</p><p>The city of Rockford, Ill., for example, has alleged that beginning in 2007 Mallinckrodt entered into several contracts designed to limit distribution of Acthar and raise its prices more than 1,300%.</p><p>The city and several union locals raised questions about whether asbestos claims asserted by Mr. Bevan's clients were filed with sufficient documentation and claimed they may be invalid.</p><p>The Acthar group also complained that an $18 million asbestos settlement in Mallinckrodt's chapter 11 plan is too generous and shortchanges other creditor groups.</p><p>Judge Dorsey said some of those arguments, including about the voting process, can be raised in future hearings on whether to approve the Mallinckrodt plan.</p><p>He also said an examiner isn't needed to determine whether asbestos claims are valid and declined to throw out those ballots</p><p>In seeking to have the ballots thrown out, the Acthar creditors group pointed to the bankruptcy case of Imerys Talc America Inc., a former supplier to Johnson &amp; Johnson that filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over lawsuits alleging talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.</p><p>The judge overseeing that case threw out more than 15,700 ballots cast by Mr. Bevan, denying Imerys the votes it needed to proceed with a settlement plan. The parties in the Imerys case are now planning to go through mediation.</p><p>Jonathan Randles contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p><p>Mallinckrodt Drug Purchasers Denied Probe of Chapter 11 Asbestos Votes</p>",
