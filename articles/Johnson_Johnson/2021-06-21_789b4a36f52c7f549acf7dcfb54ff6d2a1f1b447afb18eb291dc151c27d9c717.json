  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Covid-19 vaccine rollouts have accelerated in many Asia-Pacific countries in recent weeks, overtaking the pace of doses being administered in the U.S. and other Western nations and increasing the chances of a sooner-than-expected easing of some pandemic restrictions. </p><p>   China now accounts for roughly half the world's 33 million Covid-19 shots administered every day, with four-fifths of Beijing's adults having gotten a single dose. In the past month, South Korea increased the number of daily doses administered by 10-fold, to about 700,000. Japan and Australia, adjusted for population, are administering more doses daily right now than the U.S. or Israel, where daily uptake has slowed. </p><p>   The vaccination pace has slowed in countries that have distributed doses widely and are now facing declining demand. The U.S. has vaccinated 52% of its population, and Israel, where the world's fastest rollout occurred, has reached 63%. </p><p>   About one in five people in Asia have received a single vaccine dose, doubling since early May, but still behind the 37% in Europe and 40% in North America, according to Our World in Data's most-recent figures. Nearly three-quarters of the world's daily vaccinations are now administered in Asia, up from roughly half just weeks ago. </p><p>   Having Asia finally rev up, following months of shortages as the initial supply largely went to the West, has boosted some global rollout projections. </p><p>   By the end of the month, about a quarter of the world's population will have received a single Covid-19 shot, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report, up from an earlier projection of 17%. About half the world could be vaccinated by November, Goldman Sachs estimates. </p><p>   \"The world is looking at a more adequate supply of vaccines, meaning a larger part of the population will be vaccinated,\" said Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. \"But until a large portion of the world population is protected from Covid, the virus will mutate in different forms so we will still require management measures.\" </p><p>   The path ahead remains daunting. The rollouts in many Asian countries are in the early stages, with the most-willing individuals lining up for shots. Developing countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia are struggling to procure supplies. </p><p>   China, Taiwan and Malaysia have all seen new outbreaks in recent weeks, while Thailand is battling its worst surge of new cases. </p><p>   The threat of new variants taking hold also looms over the region. Preliminary studies have also indicated that the Delta variant of the virus, first identified in India, somewhat erodes the effectiveness of vaccines against infection, but health experts say two shots still offer strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization. </p><p>   Asia's swift uptick in vaccinations is the result of several factors. Vaccine makers can pump out more supply after investing in new production sites or striking local contract-manufacturing deals -- so there is more to go around. Parts of the region are also offering incentives for people to get vaccinated, such as lucky draws or the prospect of travel bubbles. </p><p>   Some Asian governments' rollouts were delayed by limited vaccine approvals. Japan had authorized only a vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, but in recent weeks also has given approval to doses from Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC. </p><p>   South Korea has approved Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine, as well as the three Japan has authorized. Australia has approved Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. China is using domestically produced Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and Sinopharm doses. </p><p>   Earlier this year China was distributing one million doses a day, a level partly attributed to production-capacity restraints. Successful pandemic control measures and few reported cases of the virus made many members of the public feel less urgency about getting vaccinated. </p><p>   But officials used recent outbreaks to encourage vaccinations and the campaign is now distributing about 17 million shots a day. </p><p>   Six weeks ago Japan had administered a dose to 2% of its population; the rate sat at 6% in South Korea, according to Our World in Data. Now the shares of vaccinated people have risen to 16% and 29%, respectively. </p><p>   More people have become eligible for the vaccine in South Korea, expanding from elderly people and medical staff to teachers, police officers and military personnel this month. </p><p>   \"Last month, my parents were still waiting to be vaccinated, but now I'm hearing my coworkers and my children's teachers have been vaccinated as well,\" said Jane Lee, a 37-year-old office worker in Seoul. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sha Hua and Miho Inada contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
