  "title": "Pro Bankruptcy Briefing: Evergrande Lures Bargain-Hunters; Texas Co-op Stays in Control; Cineworld Hit on Soured Merger",
  "text": "<p>Investors hunt for bargains in Evergrande bonds. Bond funds expect a long, complicated restructuring. But at 20 cents on the dollar, some believe that Evergrande debt is a buy. Led by a steering committee that includes Ashmore Group, Redwood Capital Management LLC and Värde Partners Inc., they are wagering that Evergrande's restructuring will follow market norms and that the Chinese government won't push foreign bond-holder claims behind those of domestic entities and investors.</p><p>Some are considering a swap of their debt claims for ownership of the company's offshore assets, primarily electric vehicle company Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. and a Hong Kong-based property management business. If talks fail, Evergrande's dollar-denominated bonds are governed by New York law and were issued by an entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands, giving creditors access to both legal jurisdictions for asserting their contractual rights.</p><p>But such an aggressive strategy could backfire given Evergrande's close ties to the Chinese state, fund managers said. Some analysts still expect the Chinese government to prioritize homeowners and mainland creditors over foreigners.</p><p>Texas co-op Brazos stays in control of its restructuring. A bankruptcy judge gave Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc. more time to formulate its own restructuring plan, ruling against two member-owner cooperatives that have criticized its focus on raising debt to cover the steep costs of a freak winter storm. Lawyers for Denton and Tri-County criticized Brazos for picking JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. as an investment banker for a single purpose—to raise debt financing—rather than also using the banker to explore asset sales. Brazos's lawyer said the co-op is doing work on different restructuring options but needs more time.</p><p>Cineworld hit with damages over soured merger. A Canadian court ordered Cineworld Group PLC to pay 1.29 billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to about $1 billion, in damages for walking away from a merger agreement with Cineplex Inc. after the Covid-19 pandemic rocked the movie-theater industry world-wide. The court ruling rejected U.K.-based Cineworld's arguments that Canada's Cineplex violated the terms of a planned merger between the two companies by taking steps to conserve cash, such as deferring payments to landlords, vendors and film studios.</p><p>Distress</p><p>Anchorage Capital to close flagship hedge fund. Anchorage Capital Group, one of the biggest hedge-fund investors in distressed debt, is closing its flagship fund after 18 years and returning the $7.4 billion it manages to clients, citing a market environment in which cheap money has helped keep stock and bond prices elevated while suppressing corporate defaults.</p><p>The credit fund, Anchorage Capital Partners, is suspending clients' ability to get their money back as it is wound down, the New York firm told clients in a letter Wednesday. The move comes as many firms that previously invested heavily in distressed debt have shut funds or pivoted to focus more on structured finance and private credit. Apollo Global Management Inc., Ares Management Corp., Blackstone Inc. and Brigade Capital Management are among the money managers making the transition.</p><p>Economy</p><p>Fed predicts three interest-rate hikes in 2022. The Federal Reserve set the stage for a series of interest rate increases beginning next spring, completing a major policy pivot that showed much greater concern about the potential for inflation to stay high. In another sign of the Fed's increased urgency, the central bank approved plans to more quickly scale back pandemic-related stimulus efforts, ending a program of asset purchases by March instead of June. That opens the door for them to start raising rates at their second scheduled meeting next year.</p><p>\"A decision to taper faster says something about your desire to raise rates.\"</p><p>— Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Jones Day approved for J&amp;J talc bankruptcy, pending challenges. A New Jersey bankruptcy judge said he would give a Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary interim approval to retain Jones Day to keep working on a chapter 11 case concerning personal injury claims over the company's talc-based products.</p><p>Jones Day's retention is being challenged by a Justice Department watchdog and representatives for injury claimants who argue the law firm's past representation of J&amp;J creates a conflict of interest . Jones Day is representing subsidiary LTL Management LLC, which was put into bankruptcy earlier this year in an effort to settle talc litigation.</p><p>Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey said he would approve the Jones Day retention ahead of a January hearing on the merits of the challenges. J&amp;J has said its talc products are safe but that bankruptcy is the best way to equitably settle the injury claims it faces. — Jonathan Randles</p>",
