  "text": "<p>U.S. health regulators have authorized the use of Novavax Inc.'s Covid-19 vaccine, providing a new option that works differently than the two leading vaccines, but at a time when overall demand for vaccines and boosters is low.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration said adults 18 and older may receive Novavax's vaccine.</p><p>The Novavax vaccine, given as two doses three weeks apart, could become available soon if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signs off in the coming days.</p><p>Supplies should be available soon. On Monday, the federal government agreed to secure an initial 3.2 million doses of Novavax's vaccine pending FDA authorization. The shots will be given at no charge at pharmacies and through state and local government vaccine programs.</p><p>Demand could be limited, however. Many of the people who have wanted to get vaccinated have done so during the 19 months since vaccines were first rolled out.</p><p>About 67% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, defined as two doses of mRNA vaccines or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine, according to the CDC. About 48% of fully vaccinated people have received a first booster dose, and even fewer a second booster.</p><p>Novavax has said its protein-based vaccine might appeal to some of the people who have been reluctant to receive the two leading Covid-19 vaccines. Those shots, from Moderna Inc. and from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, use gene-based messenger RNA technology.</p><p>A recent poll by Morning Consult, however, found that 77% of unvaccinated U.S. adults probably or definitely won't get a protein-based vaccine such as Novavax's if one became available. Some 10% of unvaccinated people said they would probably or definitely get a protein-based shot, according to the poll.</p><p>Novavax developed the shot to target the original strain of the coronavirus. In a study of nearly 30,000 people in the U.S. and Mexico, the Novavax vaccine was 90.4% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease in adults. In testing, the most common side effects of the vaccine were injection-site pain, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.</p><p>That study was conducted mostly in early 2021, however, before the spread of the most concerning new variants of the coronavirus, Delta, Omicron and BA.5.</p><p>Omicron and the highly contagious BA.5 subvariant have been shown to escape some of the protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines. The Novavax vaccine and other shots were designed to target the ancestral strain of the coronavirus that was predominant early in the pandemic.</p><p>Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., has said its vaccine still induces immune responses against Omicron and its subvariants including BA.5. The company is also working on a modified vaccine that would better target BA.5 and could be available by the end of the year.</p><p>The Novavax vaccine contains an engineered version of the spike protein that is found on the surface of the coronavirus. The protein itself doesn't infect people but it triggers an immune response that builds up a person's defenses if they later encounter the full coronavirus. The vaccine also contains a substance known as adjuvant, derived from the bark of a Chilean tree, designed to enhance the immune response.</p><p>The protein-based design is similar to what has been used for older vaccines such as those against shingles and hepatitis B.</p><p>In contrast, the mRNA vaccines don't contain proteins, but rather the genetic information enabling human cells to produce the proteins and induce an immune response. There were no approved mRNA vaccines before Pfizer's and Moderna's were cleared in late 2020.</p><p>Novavax has said its vaccine can be stored at higher temperatures than the mRNA vaccines, which could simplify transportation and storage in developing countries.</p><p>More than 40 other countries previously authorized the use of the Novavax vaccine, including the U.K. and Canada.</p><p>The FDA authorization is a milestone for Novavax, which had never brought a vaccine to market in the U.S. before despite years of research and development.</p><p>The initial supply of 3.2 million doses of Novavax is just a fraction of the 100 million doses Novavax originally agreed to provide the U.S. in a $1.6 billion contract signed in 2020.</p><p>But that pact initially envisioned the 100 million doses could be delivered by December 2020. Novavax has encountered repeated delays in its efforts to increase production, partly due to supply shortages, and to obtain regulatory authorization.</p><p>The federal funding, which has since been increased to $1.8 billion, also included funding for clinical testing of the Novavax vaccine and other activities.</p><p>Novavax scrambled to put together a global manufacturing network for its vaccine, including partnerships with Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan. Serum Institute of India sells a version of the Novavax vaccine as the brand Covovax, while Novavax uses the brand Nuvaxovid and proposes to use that brand in the U.S.</p><p>Liz Essley Whyte contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>FDA Authorizes Novavax's Covid-19 Vaccine</p>",
