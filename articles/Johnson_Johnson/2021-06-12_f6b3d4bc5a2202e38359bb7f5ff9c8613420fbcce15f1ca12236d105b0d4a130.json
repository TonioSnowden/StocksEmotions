  "text": "<p>\"When we hear about someone winning the lotto or being struck by lightning three times, we think it's more common than it really is,\" said Christoforos Anagnostopoulos, a statistician at Imperial College London. \"We use heuristics based on entirely irrelevant situations.\"</p><p>According to the research of Ellen Peters, an expert in decision making at the University of Oregon and author of \"Innumeracy in the Wild,\" the lack of skill can have consequences for your wallet and your health. People who are less numerate adopt fewer healthy behaviors; they are 40% more likely to have a chronic disease; they end up in the hospital or emergency room more often; and they take 20% more prescription drugs but are less able to follow complex health regimens.</p><p>Those who are good with numbers and confident in their ability fare better, Dr. Peters has found. And those who are bad with numbers but feel confident in their ability do the worst.</p><p>If you're wondering where you fit in, one famous example suggests many of us might belong to the overconfident camp.</p><p>In 1990, Marilyn vos Savant in her \"Ask Marilyn\" column for Parade magazine responded to a reader question that went something like this:</p><p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you are given the choice of three doors. Behind one is a car. Behind each of the others is a goat. You pick a door, and the host, who knows what is behind all of the alternatives, opens one of the two you didn't choose to reveal a goat. He then gives you the option to stick with your first choice or switch. Is it to your advantage to switch?</p><p>Ms. vos Savant said to switch because the first door has a 1/3 chance of winning, but the second door has a 2/3 chance.</p><p>Reams of protests poured in from professors, mathematicians and other intellectuals who disputed her answer, prompting one reader to chime in: \"You made a mistake, but look at the positive side. If all those Ph.D.'s were wrong, the country would be in some very serious trouble.\"</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>As Ms. vos Savant made clear in subsequent columns, her answer was correct.</p><p>In a nutshell, her critics erroneously believed that once one of the three doors was eliminated, the odds of finding the car behind either of the remaining two doors was 50-50.</p><p>That isn't the case.</p><p>The odds of choosing the correct door to begin with were 1 in 3, and the odds that the car was behind one of the other two doors were 2 in 3. When one door is eliminated, those odds remain the same: The odds of having selected the correct door initially are still 1 in 3, and the odds that the car is behind one of the other two are still 2 in 3 -- but only one of those doors remains.</p><p>Switching doors in this situation would double the chances of winning the car.</p><p>\"One of the big errors is going on your gut without looking at the information,\" said Katherine Ensor, a statistician at Rice University and president-elect of the American Statistical Association.</p><p>The game-show puzzle might be trivial, but in real life, Dr. Ensor points out that probability plays a role in online dating, insurance rates, stock-market investments and the results of medical tests.</p><p>When Talithia Williams, a statistician and mathematician at Harvey Mudd College, was pregnant with her third child, a physician recommended inducing labor because she was past her due date and a routine test had suggested the baby might be under stress.</p><p>The physician warned that the chance of miscarriage doubles when a pregnancy goes past the due date. But when pressed, he revealed that the odds rise from 1 in 1,000 just before a due date to 2 in 1,000, or 0.2%, just after.</p><p>Dr. Williams, who shared her experience in a Ted Talk, could live with those odds. She and her husband opted not to induce.</p><p>Perhaps it's no wonder today that some people are wary of receiving the Covid-19 vaccine knowing that at least 28 people have suffered serious blood clots after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot -- even though nearly nine million people have received it without consequence -- and millions of the J&amp;J vaccine doses are at risk of expiring.</p><p>So, what are the odds of an adverse reaction?</p><p>Dr. Anagnostopoulos, who has helped develop a probability-based dice game called Borel, offered this example.</p><p>\"Let's assume that the risk for a certain group of people was that 1 in 50,000 would get a clot after having the vaccine,\" he said. \"If instead you were told you need to roll six dice and get all of them to be a one, would it be easier for you to make a decision?\"</p><p>The odds of simultaneously rolling six ones, he said, are also 1 in almost 50,000. But you probably wouldn't bet on it happening to you.</p>",
