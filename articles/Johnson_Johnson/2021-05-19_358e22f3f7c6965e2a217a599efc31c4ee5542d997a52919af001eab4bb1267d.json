  "text": "<p>The EU has paved the way for Covid-19 vaccinated holidaymakers to return for the crucial summer tourist season but the UK faces a potential hurdle because of the spread of a highly transmissible variant. </p> <p>The European bloc's 27 countries provisionally agreed on Wednesday to open up to fully jabbed visitors and ease rules that bar non-essential travel from countries where coronavirus infection rates pass a cut-off point. </p> <p>But member states would also have discretion to apply an “emergency brake” on visits from countries with variants “of concern or interest” — and the UK may fall into this category.</p> <p>The tentative EU agreement still needs formal ministerial approval and is in any case a recommendation only. It is an attempt to formalise a piecemeal opening already taking place as a growing number of countries depart from the bloc's common travel rules. British holidaymakers have flocked to Portugal this week after the Iberian country <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a5ea761-be91-4af4-b847-e0a859e50796\">revoked curbs on visitors from the UK</a>.</p> <p>The proposed EU new rules will also be dependent on the successful launch of a planned bloc vaccine passport, known as a digital vaccination certificate, which is proving complicated to implement. There is as yet no international electronic system for proof of vaccination, either in the EU or outside.</p> <p>The EU travel plan builds on a European Commission proposal this month to ease a longstanding pandemic ban on non-essential visits to the bloc from all but a handful of countries with low Covid infection rates.</p> <p>Under the proposals, EU countries would admit fully-jabbed visitors from outside the bloc for non-essential travel, according to a copy of the proposals seen by the Financial Times. </p> <p>Visitors would need to have received their final dose of a vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency — BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson — at least 14 days before arrival in the EU.</p> <p>Those on the World Health Organization's emergency list, which now includes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7220cbdd-4b8c-49f1-9cf7-5146a691adb6\">China's Sinopharm</a>, would also be considered. </p> <p>Children too young to be vaccinated would be able to travel with jabbed parents if they had tested negative for Covid-19 in the 72 hours before arrival in the EU.&#xa0;</p> <p>The EU plan would also introduce a less stringent coronavirus infection benchmark that countries must reach to be considered safe. The cut-off point would be raised from 25 to 75 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the previous 14 days. </p> <p>That could in theory open the way to the addition of the UK and other countries to the current seven nations from which non-essential travel is permitted — Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.</p> <p>But nations that have reduced Covid infection rates may still be excluded from the safe list if they have not made strong progress on vaccination, are not testing sufficiently widely, do not offer reciprocal rights to EU travellers — or have problems with variants. </p> <p>Some EU member states may be reluctant to relax rules for visitors from the UK, in part because of concerns about the spread in the country of an infectious coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f85c24c0-ff81-4dc4-9399-851052eb9c3c\">variant identified in India</a>, diplomats said.</p> <p>EU member states will continue to have discretion over what precautionary requirements to apply to travellers on arrival, such as testing and quarantine.&#xa0;</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/249a2ab9-d5ac-409d-8adf-6b03553d342e.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Michael Peel in Brussels 2021 'EU plans to open up to vaccinated tourists ' FT.com 19 May.
