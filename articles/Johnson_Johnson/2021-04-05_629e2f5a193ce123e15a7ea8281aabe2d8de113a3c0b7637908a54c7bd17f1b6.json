  "text": "<p>   CHICAGO -- Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine has found a niche among organizations that work with the homeless, who say the one-dose shot is better-suited for a population that can be difficult to reach twice. </p><p>   The U.S. homeless population has soared during the pandemic. Shelters have become a source of spread as experts puzzle over how to stem stubbornly high infection rates despite an aggressive national vaccine rollout. </p><p>   In Chicago, the Night Ministry, a group that serves the homeless, has increasingly used the J&amp;J vaccine since it was approved by U.S. regulators in late February. Before that, the group had only the Moderna Inc. vaccine, which requires two shots. But the often-transient population can be tough to find a second time, said Stephan Koruba, a nurse practitioner with the Night Ministry, especially those sleeping on the Chicago Transit Authority train system. Now, the group offers both. </p><p>   \"When we're out on the CTA, we're never going to see these people again,\" Mr. Koruba said. \"We've specifically held to J&amp;J doses for them.\" </p><p>   Many of the group's beneficiaries live on the streets. Others live in tent encampments. Or, for those able to pay a few hundred dollars a month to escape Chicago's frigid winter, in transient hotels. </p><p>   Outside one such hotel, word spread recently that the Night Ministry had arrived, and people trickled out. As he prepared to administer the J&amp;J vaccine, Nathan Lin, a medical resident working with the group, asked William Bryant, 67 years old, if he had a phone number. He responded that he didn't, pointing to his temporary residence above. </p><p>   \"Just right up there,\" Mr. Bryant said. </p><p>   President Biden has set a goal of 200 million vaccines by April 30. About 162 million doses have been administered so far, data show, with the J&amp;J vaccine representing about 3.8 million. The company faced a setback when one batch of the main ingredient for its vaccine didn't meet quality standards at a contract manufacturer, and the doses weren't distributed. J&amp;J still plans to deliver a total of 100 million doses by the end of May. </p><p>   Aside from Chicago, groups in California, Maryland and Tennessee are among those nationwide administering the J&amp;J vaccines in encampments, shelters, and even on subways. </p><p>   The number of people facing unstable housing and food scarcity has skyrocketed during the pandemic, said Salvation Army Commissioner Kenneth Hodder. The Salvation Army says it provided 1.8 million nights of shelter to people who said they needed it as a direct result of the pandemic. </p><p>   Shelters and transient hotels became a source of spread, according to city officials nationwide. The Salvation Army converted many of its thrift stores and administrative buildings into makeshift shelters to spread out the population. Those people were already dealing with other difficulties such as substance abuse, mental illness and comorbidities associated with poorer outcomes for Covid-19 infection. </p><p>   \"With respect to homelessness, we have seen a pandemic laid on top of an epidemic,\" Mr. Hodder said. </p><p>   In the Chattanooga, Tenn., area, Christina Butler, a registered nurse and Covid-19 vaccine coordinator for the Hamilton County Health Department's Homeless Health Care Center, said the hardest part by far about getting people vaccinated is getting them the second shot. Ms. Butler said her group has been able to give a second dose to about 60% of recipients after extensive efforts to locate them. Many people are now requesting the J&amp;J shots, she added. </p><p>   Some community workers have found pockets of resistance to the J&amp;J vaccine among religious groups because it required the use of fetal cell cultures to produce and manufacture the vaccine. Some people said they were concerned that it was a less-effective, \"poor person's shot.\" </p><p>   Even so, healthcare workers say they have been surprised to find many homeless people specifically requesting the J&amp;J vaccine. Some of them point out that the shot was still effective even though it was tested after Covid-19 variants entered the mix. Others say they are worried about getting a vaccine once, let alone twice, given potential side effects. </p><p>   \"If you're in a shelter, or don't have a home, those side effects are different than if you can stay at home,\" said Bobby Watts, chief executive of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, which supports hundreds of providers that cater to the homeless. </p><p>   Nurse practitioner Mary Tornabene of Heartland Alliance Health in Chicago said that when her group received its first shipment of J&amp;J shots, it offered both the J&amp;J and Moderna doses at a meal program for people who mostly live on the street. Within 40 minutes, the J&amp;J supply was used up. </p><p>   \"They all wanted that,\" she said. \"The thought for some people to get this shot once is hard enough, let alone twice.\" </p><p></p>",
