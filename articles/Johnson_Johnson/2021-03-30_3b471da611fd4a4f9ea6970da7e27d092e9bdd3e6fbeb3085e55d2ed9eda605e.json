  "text": "<p>The Federal Trade Commission has sought to block Illumina's planned $7.1bn acquisition of Grail, the cancer screening start-up backed by Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, citing concerns that it will harm competition in the US market.&#xa0;</p> <p>The agency filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to stop the deal, a rare move for two companies that are not direct competitors, saying it would slow innovations for novel tests designed to detect cancer early. </p> <p>Grail is among a number of companies that specialises in the emerging field of liquid biopsy, where blood samples are used to screen for cancer.&#xa0;</p> <p>Illumina, which founded Grail less than six years ago and owns a near-15 per cent stake in the company, sells genetic sequencing machines used to run the tests. That has raised concerns at the FTC that the San Diego-based biotech company could increase prices for Grail's rivals and snuff out competition.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Vertical mergers in the healthcare sector can choke off competition, kill off new discoveries, and jack up prices for patients,” FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra said on Twitter.</p> <p>Illumina said it would oppose the action and proceed with the transaction. Chief executive Francis deSouza said the company has a “deeply vested interest in ensuring that all organizations have equal and fair access to high quality, reliable and cost-effective sequencing”.</p> <p>Grail chief executive Hans Bishop said the combination would “enable more patients in both the United States and worldwide to garner access to Grail's test faster”.</p> <p>Illumina initially set up Grail as a separate company in 2015, taking a majority stake in the new venture. Grail went on to raise capital from investors such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Arch Venture Partners. </p> <p>Illumina <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a180e0a-9a88-43ed-b41f-19d2e360edfd\">announced a deal</a> to acquire Grail in September, agreeing to give up a portion of the start-up's future revenues to its existing shareholders for 12 years.</p> <p>Before striking the deal, Grail had filed for an initial public offering that it said would raise $100m. The company has raised a total of $2bn from investors, according to PitchBook data.</p> <p>The action is not the first time the FTC has taken aim at Illumina. In 2019, the agency challenged the company's $1.2bn proposed acquisition of the gene sequencing systems company Pacific Biosciences, leading to the companies abandoning the transaction.</p> <p>Shares in Illumina fell more than 7 per cent on the news of the lawsuit.</p><p>Source: Ortenca Aliaj in New York and Miles Kruppa in San Francisco 2021 'US sues to block Illumina's acquisition of liquid biopsy group' FT.com 30 March.
