  "title": "U.S. News:  FDA Looks to Quickly Authorize Booster Shots for Variants  ----  By Thomas M. Burton",
  "text": "<p>   The Food and Drug Administration said that it would quickly analyze any vaccine booster shots against Covid-19 variants such as those from South Africa and the U.K., and wouldn't require further large clinical trials of the new shots' effectiveness. </p><p>   The agency issued new guidance for vaccine manufacturers as it looks to establish speedier procedures to deal with virus mutations that could worsen the pandemic. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the agency is seeking \"efficient ways to modify medical products that either are in the pipeline or have been authorized for emergency use to address emerging variants.\" </p><p>   The agency also announced new guidelines for makers of diagnostic tests and monoclonal-antibody drugs about how those companies can best adapt their products to address mutations now cropping up in the U.S. </p><p>    Peter Marks, director of the FDA's center for biological products, which evaluates vaccines, said Monday that the analysis of whether vaccines prevent the new strains of Covid-19 will involve a few hundred research subjects over a couple of months. That would be faster than vaccine trials, which so far have involved thousands of research subjects over several months, followed by an FDA analysis. </p><p>   The federal agency has been criticized for taking up to three weeks to analyze the clinical study of a new vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson. J&amp;J said its vaccine was 72% effective in the U.S. in preventing moderate to severe Covid-19 infection. This compared with 57% in South Africa, where the mutant strain has been prominently present. </p><p>   The J&amp;J vaccine will be evaluated Friday at a public meeting of an independent committee of medical experts who will advise the agency on whether to green-light the product. There are two Covid-19 vaccines already cleared by the FDA -- one from Moderna Inc., and the other from a partnership of Pfizer Inc. and Germany's BioNTech SE. </p><p>   The FDA said in a written statement Monday that \"available information suggests that the FDA-authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently-circulating strains\" of the virus. Similarly, the agency said the impact of the new strains of the virus on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for Covid-19 didn't appear to be significant. </p><p></p>",
