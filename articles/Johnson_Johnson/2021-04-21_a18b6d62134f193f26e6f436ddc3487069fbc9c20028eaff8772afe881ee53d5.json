  "text": "<p>Manakin Sabot, Va.</p><p>---</p><p>\"Informed consent\" is missing from the discussion. Rather than pause all J&amp;J vaccinations, present the risks -- six in 6.8 million vaccinated, but varying by demographic group -- to patients and allow them to make their own decisions. Patients should know that this vaccine comes with an extremely small chance of having a blood clot -- not far from its occurrence in the general population without the vaccine. This approach would still allow vaccinations to continue and prevent many more deaths from Covid-19.</p><p>Public health and medicine are never perfect. They balance risks and benefits while keeping patients informed of the trade-offs. But we are in a world-wide crisis. Many more lives are at risk than six in 6.8 million.</p><p>Scott Wilkinson, M.D.</p><p>Birmingham, Mich.</p>",
