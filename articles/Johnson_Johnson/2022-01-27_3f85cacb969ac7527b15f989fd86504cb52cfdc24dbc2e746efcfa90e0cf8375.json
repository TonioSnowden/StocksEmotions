  "text": "<p>China Evergrande promised to play by the book. The embattled property developer said it aims to announce a global restructuring plan within six months and it would respect offshore creditors' legal rights.</p><p>Evergrande, during its first call with offshore bondholders on Wednesday, promised to follow the rule of law and respect bondholders' claims including the company's secured offshore assets, according to people familiar with the matter. The company also said its founder and Chairman Xu Jiayin might provide additional financial support to the company to support its restructuring.</p><p>A group of Evergrande's foreign creditors last week threatened legal action that could potentially include liquidation of the company's assets. The group said it was fully within its rights to do so after a continued lack of engagement from Evergrande since the company defaulted in December. The company urged creditors for more patience on Wednesday as it hires auditors to complete due diligence on its business segments and subsidiaries.</p><p>Brooklyn properties' bankruptcy sale reopened. A bankruptcy judge, instead of approving the winning bid at a confirmation hearing, reopened the auction for nine Brooklyn real-estate properties backed by landlord Chaskiel Strulovitch. An outside bidder and the buildings' top creditor complained about a sale process riddled with confusion and persuaded the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case, who ordered a redo after concluding that auction participants might have acted differently had the correct procedures been followed.</p><p>Economy</p><p>Fed signals March rate hike. The Federal Reserve held short-term interest rates steady on Wednesday and signaled intentions to raise them in mid-March, the latest turn toward removing stimulus to temper elevated inflation.

A group of law professors criticized Johnson &amp; Johnson's bid to use chapter 11 to settle about 38,000 personal injury cases tied to its talcum-based products, saying the company's strategy is an abuse of the bankruptcy system.</p><p>The group of seven professors on Tuesday urged Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., to dismiss a J&amp;J's subsidiary, LTL Management, from chapter 11. The scholars said allowing the case to proceed \"would add to an evolving roadmap for other companies facing liability to manufacture a sham entity to unfairly rid themselves of liability\". — Jonathan Randles</p><p>Defunct Philadelphia refiner settles with insurers.
