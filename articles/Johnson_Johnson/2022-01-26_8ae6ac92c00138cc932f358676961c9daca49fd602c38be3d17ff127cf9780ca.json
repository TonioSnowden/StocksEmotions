  "text": "<p>The surge in Omicron caseloads, coupled with hospital staffing shortages, put off procedures that use J&amp;J devices like artificial joints, J&amp;J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview Tuesday.</p><p>Supply constraints hit J&amp;J's consumer-health business, particularly skin-care products. Mr. Wolk said it was difficult to secure some raw materials, which limited the availability of certain products.</p><p>Joaquin Duato, on his first earnings conference call since taking the CEO job on Jan. 3. said he expects the company to be more active in pursuing acquisitions that will bolster the pharmaceutical and medical-device units.</p><p>In the latest quarter, J&amp;J sold $1.62 billion of its Covid-19 vaccine, with international buyers accounting for most of those sales. Total 2021 sales of the shot were $2.39 billion.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, J&amp;J posted sales of $24.8 billion, up from $22.48 billion a year earlier.
