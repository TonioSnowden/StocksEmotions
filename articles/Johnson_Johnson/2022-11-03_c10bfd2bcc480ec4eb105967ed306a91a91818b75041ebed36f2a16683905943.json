  "title": "Walgreens, CVS Reach $10 Billion Deal Over Opioids",
  "text": "<p>Each state, local government and tribe still must decide whether to participate in the settlement. In a statement, the plaintiffs' attorneys appointed to lead the negotiations said they encouraged governments and tribes to join the settlement, which they said holds the pharmacies accountable.</p><p>Under the proposed deal, CVS would pay $4.9 billion to states and municipalities and $130 million to tribes over the next 10 years starting in 2023. The company said the agreement isn't an admission of guilt and that it would continue to defend against any litigation that the settlement doesn't resolve.</p><p>Walgreens said it has offered to pay up to $4.79 billion to states over 15 years and about $155 million to tribes. It also expects to pay up to $753.5 million in attorneys' fees over six years. The company said the settlement wasn't an admission of wrongdoing.</p><p>Walgreens said it is committed to being part of the solution to opioid addiction. \"This settlement framework will allow us to keep our focus on the health and well-being of our customers and patients, while making positive contributions to address the opioid crisis,\" it said in a statement.</p><p>Cities and counties have said they would use the money to bolster social services focused on the harms of opioid addiction as well as for funds for first responders. There wouldn't be direct payments to families or individuals. Unlike states' landmark settlement with tobacco companies, the money couldn't be redirected into general funds.</p><p>\"The pharmacists were dispensing drugs that were written prescriptions,\" CVS CEO Karen Lynch said in an interview. \"And given the magnitude of the crisis, there are people looking across industries and how to help combat this and how to help states fight the battle.\"</p><p>Ms. Lynch said she was optimistic that states would join the deal since attorneys general were part of the negotiations.</p><p>The drugstore chain has been in a separate legal battle with its insurers over whether they should cover some of the liability the company faces for the opioid lawsuits.</p><p>Widespread opioid abuse has claimed more than half a million lives since 1999 and triggered more than 3,000 lawsuits by governments, hospitals and others against players in the pharmaceutical industry, including manufacturers, distributors and drugstores.</p><p>Many of the lawsuits allege that pharmacies didn't do enough to stem the flow of pills. The drugstores have argued that they had tried to stop pills from being illegally diverted and followed procedures required by regulators.</p><p>In August, a federal judge in Ohio ordered CVS, Walgreens and Walmart Inc. to pay $650 million over 15 years to two Ohio counties after a jury found the companies liable for contributing to the opioid epidemic.</p><p>That case, closely watched by attorneys elsewhere, was the first decision reached among opioid lawsuits targeting the pharmacy chains. The judge's order came following a six-week trial; the companies said at the time that they planned to appeal the decision.</p><p>In March, CVS agreed to pay $484 million to settle opioid-related claims by the state of Florida, without admitting wrongdoing. Walgreens later agreed to pay $683 million to settle the Florida lawsuit without admitting wrongdoing. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid Corp. also settled with two New York counties in 2021 for a combined $26 million.</p><p>Walmart declined to comment. Rite Aid didn't respond to requests to comment.</p><p>In 2021, a group of states reached a roughly $25 billion settlement with Johnson &amp; Johnson and drug distributors including McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc. The deal was completed this summer.</p><p>J&amp;J said its $5 billion payment wasn't an admission of liability. The drug distributors, which are paying about $20 billion over 18 years, said they disputed the allegations against them.</p><p>Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP and grew wealthy from sales of OxyContin agreed this year to pay up to $6 billion to settle lawsuits accusing them of helping fuel the opioid-addiction epidemic. The settlement came after an earlier $4.5 billion settlement was overturned by a federal judge.</p><p>The family didn't admit liability but will cede control of Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and pleaded guilty in 2020 to three federal felonies related to the marketing and sale of OxyContin.</p><p>CVS said spreading out the settlement payments would allow it to continue to invest in its business. The company for years has worked to transform itself from a pharmacy chain to an integrated provider of medical services, with the biggest step being its 2018 acquisition of insurer Aetna. In September, CVS agreed to buy home-care provider Signify Health Inc. in an all-cash $8 billion deal.</p><p>On Wednesday, CVS reported results for the quarter ended Sept. 30 that included a 10% jump in revenue and a $3.42 billion net loss, weighed down by charges for the opioid litigation and other items.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings came to $2.09 a share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of $2 a share.</p><p>CVS sales improved across segments to $81.16 billion, including a 9.9% increase in the insurance business and a 6.9% gain in pharmacies.</p>",
