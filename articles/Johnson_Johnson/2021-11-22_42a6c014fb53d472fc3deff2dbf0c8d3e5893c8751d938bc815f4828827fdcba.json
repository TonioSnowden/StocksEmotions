Personal-injury claimants alleging Johnson &amp; Johnson's talc products caused cancer said they will seek to dismiss the bankruptcy proceedings it filed to drive a settlement. In court papers Friday, a committee of talc claimants outlined a series of steps they expect to take to challenge the chapter 11 filing by LTL Management LLC, the J&amp;J subsidiary containing its talc-related liabilities.</p><p>J&amp;J filed the unit for bankruptcy in North Carolina before the chapter 11 case was shipped to New Jersey at the request of some injury victims. The talc committee said it would file in New Jersey a request to dismiss the bankruptcy as being filed in bad faith. A request to allow talc lawsuits to resume against J&amp;J is also forthcoming.</p><p>Talc litigation against the company, which isn't itself in bankruptcy, is currently on hold through mid-January. J&amp;J has said the proceeding is the best and fairest way to compensate talc users, though the company maintains its products are safe and don't cause cancer. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>Owner of ‘The One' megamansion eyes 2022 bankruptcy auction.

The Covid-19 pandemic was supposed to deliver a knockout punch to department stores and specialty retailers. Instead, many of them are bouncing back healthier.
