  "title": "Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Booster Shot Was 95.6% Effective in Large Trial, Companies Say; The results came from testing in people while the contagious Delta variant was prevalent",
  "text": "<p>The additional dose was safe and tolerable, and consistent with what was known about the vaccine, the companies said.</p><p>The study was carried out while the highly contagious Delta variant was prevalent, the companies said, suggesting the booster helps protect against the contagious strain.</p><p>\"These results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,\" said Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>The results were the first from a study testing whether an additional dose of a Covid-19 vaccine provides protection in people. Up until now, companies have reported a booster increased antibody levels but not tied the immune response specifically to whether that meant increased protection.</p><p>Based on the antibody data, U.S. health authorities in September authorized a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adults 65 years and older and others at high risk.</p><p>The data could help the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as it weighs whether to broaden Pfizer's booster use beyond the seniors and high-risk people permitted under current authorization.</p><p>The companies said they planned to submit the data to health authorities in the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>The companies reported the findings in a press release and provided few medical details. The results haven't been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p>\"Based on these findings we believe that, in addition to broad global access to vaccines for everyone, booster vaccinations could play an important role in sustaining pandemic containment and a return to normalcy,\" said BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin.</p><p>In the study, the companies enrolled more than 10,000 people who were 16 years and older and had received the two-dose shot. Pfizer and BioNTech enrolled subjects in the U.S., Brazil and South Africa who had been part of the late-stage study that led to the vaccine's original authorization. Half of the subjects got a booster dose, and the rest took a placebo.</p><p>On average, the people received a booster dose 11 months after their second dose.</p><p>The protection from the vaccine was consistent across age, sex, race, ethnicity and comorbidities, the companies said, although they didn't provide any details.</p><p>About half of the subjects were between 16 and 55 years, while nearly one-quarter of the subjects were 65 years and older.</p><p>The companies had announced that a third dose generated a stronger immune system against the original Covid-19 strain compared with the original two-dose course.</p><p>As part of its application for booster authorization in September, Pfizer and BioNTech had provided health regulators antibody data of the vaccine against the Delta variant in a small number of subjects.</p><p>Booster doses for vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna Inc. were cleared by the FDA this week, as well as mixing and matching vaccines and the extra doses.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
