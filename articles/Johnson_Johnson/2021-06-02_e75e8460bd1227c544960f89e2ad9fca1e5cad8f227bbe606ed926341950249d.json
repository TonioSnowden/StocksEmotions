  "title": "U.S. News: Countries Ask U.S. to Share Doses",
  "text": "<p>\"What the U.S. has is a gold mine,\" Ravinatha Aryasinha, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the U.S., said.</p><p>The administration said it planned to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, following a safety review by the Food and Drug Administration, and 20 million doses of the vaccines from Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose shots are being given to people in the U.S.</p><p>The Biden administration has faced growing pressure to share vaccine doses with developing countries amid outbreaks in India and Brazil. President Biden said the U.S. would be a world leader in global vaccination efforts and characterized the 80 million doses as a first step.</p><p>Those doses represent a fraction of those needed to vaccinate much of the world's eight billion population. Countries are desperate for any doses because of outbreaks and emerging variants, and there is limited supply as manufacturers increase production and expand capacity.</p><p>The Biden administration has said U.S. doses will be shared both directly with other countries and through Covax, a global initiative to deliver vaccines to developing countries. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week that an announcement would be made soon on where doses would be distributed.</p><p>A White House official said the National Security Council, Department of Health and Human Services, State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been involved in determining where to send the doses. The administration has also been consulting people involved with Covax, vaccine manufacturers and others on considerations that include shipping doses out of the country, transporting them to different places and legal requirements, the person said.</p><p>Some vaccines require special cold-chain logistics, which could be difficult in some low-income countries.</p><p>The U.S. has fully vaccinated more than 50% of its adult population. But the administration has waited to share doses in part because it is trying to reach hesitant Americans and has begun vaccinating adolescents.</p><p>Last month, the administration said it supported a proposal from India, South Africa and other countries to share intellectual property of Covid-19 vaccines to help spur production. The drug industry and trade experts have said that such a move wouldn't increase doses in the short term.</p><p>The world's poorest 50 countries account for just 2% of the Covid-19 vaccines administered globally so far, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p><p>Bangladesh's Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen asked the U.S. in a May 7 letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken for at least two million AstraZeneca doses immediately and another 10 million to 20 million later on.</p><p>Bangladesh made the request because it needs to administer second doses to about 1.6 million people and is willing to buy the doses if they can't be donated, Mr. Momen said. He said he has made the request in meetings with U.S. officials here and in Bangladesh.</p><p>\"We are in desperate need for this two million,\" he said. \"This has become a crisis.\"</p><p>He said U.S. officials have said they are weighing the request.</p><p>In a letter to Mr. Biden on Sunday, Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked for access to the 80 million doses and requested a phone call to discuss how their governments can cooperate on vaccine research and production.</p><p>After Mr. Biden announced plans to export AstraZeneca doses, Sri Lanka asked the U.S. to provide 600,000 doses so the country could give second shots to people in the country, Mr. Aryasinha said. He said the country has a shortfall because it stopped receiving doses from the Serum Institute of India after India banned exports.</p><p>Afghanistan asked the U.S. to provide doses directly to the country and through multilateral efforts such as Covax, according to a spokeswoman for the country's embassy.</p>",
