Israel, which was among the first countries to roll out a vaccination programme, is now busy administering top-ups after its researchers found <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23cdbf8c-b5ef-4596-bb46-f510606ab556\">waning immunity</a> after taking the BioNTech/Pfizer jab, which the country has used almost exclusively.</p> <p>Pharma companies are manoeuvring swiftly to get their boosters approved. Pfizer and BioNTech on Wednesday became the first to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a539196-22cd-4d99-8a58-6a258ec1225f#post-2a9f4065-34ef-4eaf-bc9b-daeab35d07a8\">apply</a>&#xa0;for full US regulatory approval for their supplementary shot, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32f524c1-d1ae-46b0-9d75-9ee9e142d726\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> said preliminary data showed its booster provided a strong and rapid antibody response against the virus.</p> <p>However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has queried whether boosters were “effective at all”, insisting that they should only go to those with weakened immune systems and that spare doses should go to countries that have received only minimal supplies. An <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e126f315-9ebe-4677-8dc5-ad5fdea8abbe\">FT analysis</a> shows more boosters have been given out in a handful of countries than total doses administered in half a dozen African nations combined.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49641651-e10a-45f6-a7cc-8b8c7b7a9710\"><em>Read our explainer</em></a><em>: Are vaccines becoming less effective at preventing Covid infection?</em></p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>US stocks hit record highs after Federal Reserve chief <strong>Jay Powell </strong>signalled the bank could begin winding down its emergency stimulus programme <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a3f0c87-7e46-4d8d-9157-6d839c4b8aec\">by the end of the year</a>. In a highly-anticipated speech on “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm\">monetary policy in the time of Covid</a>” to central bankers gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell gave an update on the Fed's twin goals for reducing its support for the US economy. “My view is that the ‘substantial further progress' test has been met for inflation,” he said. “There has also been clear progress toward maximum employment.”</p> <p>More evidence is emerging of <strong>supply chain disruption</strong> and its threat to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3befa5f6-e80a-4f83-b608-28f1682af856\">UK's economic recovery</a>. Brexit-related labour shortages have compounded global problems such as the lack of semiconductors and rising raw materials costs and have affected companies such as McDonalds and Greggs. Supermarkets have warned that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27742f31-fdde-44b5-a053-73179a460c07\">Christmas supplies</a> could fall short. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation, said: “Post-pandemic, post-Brexit, we're going to be in a different place than we've been in for decades.”</p> <p>Foreign businesses are threatening to leave <strong>Hong Kong</strong> as criticism mounts of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c6bf58a-3291-4760-84a5-d9eb2cb5fd30\">strict quarantine rules</a> that mean frequent travel has virtually disappeared over the past year or so. The city's approach contrasts sharply with rival Asian finance hub Singapore, which is planning to reopen to foreign travel from next month.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>British Airways</strong>' plan for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/636cc4a2-5f08-4c80-a20e-5e8fbeb8ba21\">new low-cost short-haul business</a> is the latest example of how the pandemic is shaking up the travel industry. Parent company IAG has run up huge losses as flights were grounded and operated just a fifth of normal schedules in the first quarter.</p> <p>Fitness technology group <strong>Peloton</strong> was a pandemic winner as consumers took to working out at home, but has been hit hard by the reopening of gyms and competition from rivals such as Mirror and Hydrow. Peloton said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b2bafa9-9a32-4230-8cdc-48814a52c84d\">sales would be less than expected</a> in the current quarter and warned that profitability would be hit by higher commodity costs and the decision to slash prices of its bikes.</p> <p>A less high-tech business, the <strong>UK antiques market</strong>, was affected badly during the pandemic as the number of fairs and house clearances dwindled. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8c8cc94-8e04-479a-8efc-434700031cae\">forced move online</a> has helped some dealers, but it can make buying stock more difficult: “You're facing a screen and, for all you know, the world. People jump in, Russians, Chinese, and starting prices are higher than I'd think of ending at,” said one person.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><strong>Brazil's</strong> currency and stocks have come under pressure as investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f58ce22-c006-48c8-a789-22b0cc3b80ed\">concerns grow over economic recovery</a> and public spending in Latin America's largest economy. A leading investment executive blamed the government's weakened political position: “They are having a very difficult time governing and the implication of their mistakes is that their popularity has been declining. Consequently, we have increasing radicalisation of speeches and acts. None of this is good for markets.”</p> <p><strong>US investors</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c17db619-b7a7-4501-8983-d86e90ff3721\">cut the borrowing they used to buy shares</a> for the first time since the pandemic began. Sentiment has taken a knock from factors such as the Chinese tech crackdown as well as economic data falling short of expectations. </p> <p><strong>South Korea</strong> on Thursday became the first big Asian economy to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5377cf69-4b5c-494b-b515-837c5bd4b8fe\">raise interest rates</a> since the start of the pandemic in response to&#xa0;record household debt and soaring property prices. The country is set for GDP growth of 4 per cent this year thanks to export-led demand for electronics such as computer chips and smartphones.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>Confederacy of Dunces</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3befa5f6-e80a-4f83-b608-28f1682af856?commentID=4575c893-46ef-4dc0-8682-3d97dc079c30\">Supply chain disruption threatens to hold back UK economic recovery</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Many economies are facing into the manifest challenges of the new normal as we adapt to life with Covid.</p>  <p>None has chosen to rupture decades old trading arrangements and destroy trust with its main trading partner. Simultaneously it seeks to renegotiate trade deals from a position of weakness having shown itself willing to renege on its own recently signed treaty obligations.</p>  <p>The reality is that things will sadly get a lot worse as much of the self-inflicted red tape has yet to be implemented. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>The urge to seek comforting experiences that sustained us during the pandemic could well stay with us once the virus has gone. Read about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ed08931-80b0-43a0-9bba-6c4bcc1b3e70\">phenomenon of “treat brain”</a> and how Covid-19 may have rewired the way we think.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'More countries plan Covid booster shots' FT.com 27 August.
