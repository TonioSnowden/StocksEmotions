  "title": "AstraZeneca Delayed  In FDA Approval Bid  ----  By Jenny Strasburg and Thomas M. Burton",
  "text": "<p>   AstraZeneca PLC executives have struggled to pull together the full data necessary to apply for U.S. approval of its Covid-19 shot, according to people familiar with the matter, further delaying its efforts to secure the Food and Drug Administration's go-ahead. </p><p>   The company said last month that it would apply for what is known as emergency-use authorization for its vaccine by mid-April. It has recently told U.S. officials it might need until mid-May to finish its application for an FDA review, according to one of these people. </p><p>   One especially time-consuming task has been compiling British data from almost four months of vaccinations in the U.K., including efficacy, virus-transmission and safety statistics, people close to the process said. The FDA is expecting to see the data, according to one of those people, adding to the complexity of AstraZeneca's submission. The extra data are also likely to lengthen any FDA review. </p><p>   The AstraZeneca shot is approved and being used in large numbers around the globe, including across much of Europe, Asia and Latin America. </p><p>   The Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson shots that the FDA has authorized had large-scale human trial data but little or none fromreal-world rollouts outside of controlled studies. </p><p>   U.S. health and industry officials have said publicly that the U.S. has ordered so many doses of those already-approved shots that it might not need AstraZeneca's for its inoculation drive. But AstraZeneca executives hope an FDA endorsement can bolster confidence in the vaccine in the rest of the world, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   AstraZeneca is struggling to fix high-profile production problems in Europe and has grappled with hundreds of incidents of rare but serious blood-clotting among people who have received its vaccine. European regulators and the drugmaker are studying those cases but said that for most adults, and especially older people, the risks of Covid-19 are much greater than those of blood clotting from vaccinations. </p><p>   AstraZeneca and partners have been making doses in the U.S. ahead of its FDA application. The White House said this week that it would share as many as 60 million of those doses with the rest of the world, pending a product-quality review, as part of efforts to support countries crippled by Covid-19 infections. That audit is separate from the FDA emergency-use authorization process. </p><p>   AstraZeneca is bound by its contract with the U.S. to apply for authorization, according to company and government officials. In May 2020, it received a pledge of up to $1.2 billion from the U.S. government to deliver at least 300 million shots. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration still expects AstraZeneca to fulfill that order. </p><p>   \"They will decide when they apply\" for FDA emergency-use authorization, Ms. Psaki said. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said this week that the company is progressing in its preparation of the FDA submission but declined to give a timetable. </p><p>   What happens in the U.S. matters for vaccine rollouts elsewhere. Much of the world is counting on AstraZeneca's shot, which it developed in partnership with scientists at the University of Oxford. It is cheaper than rival Covid-19 vaccines and easier than most to transport and store. </p><p>   AstraZeneca has pledged to provide three billion doses at no profit this year, with much of that supply destined for poorer countries. So far, the company has failed to meet several core delivery promises, citing production issues and export restrictions. </p><p>   An FDA signoff could boost global acceptance of the drugmaker's shot, health and drug-industry experts said. But some said that if fresh doubts were to surface in an FDA review, that could undermine public perceptions of the vaccine. </p><p>   \"If it were not authorized, that would be a blow to the whole world, not just the U.S.,\" said Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Biden team adviser, oncologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania. </p><p>   In March, a public spat between AstraZeneca and U.S. officials cast doubt over the company's preliminary analysis of its vaccine in pivotal, large-scale U.S. trials. The dispute focused on data used to determine the shot's precise efficacy at preventing symptomatic Covid-19. </p><p>   After updating its data from large-scale U.S. trials the same week, AstraZeneca said its shot was 76% effective. That is well over the minimum 50% bar set by the FDA for pandemic vaccines but lower than the 90%-plus rates shown by both Pfizer's and Moderna's shots. </p><p>   The AstraZeneca shot uses a viral-vector technology similar to the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. U.S. officials briefly paused the J&amp;J shot after a handful of severe blood-clotting incidents. J&amp;J and U.S. regulators said they planned to add language to the vaccine's label and fact sheets warning of the rare clotting condition risk. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sabrina Siddiqui contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
