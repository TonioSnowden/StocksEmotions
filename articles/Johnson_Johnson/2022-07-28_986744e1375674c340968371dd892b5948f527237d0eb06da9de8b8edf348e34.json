  "title": "Teva Tries to Put an End to the Opioid Wars; One of the world's largest generic drugmakers tries to get past a lengthy legal battle, but it is still struggling to find growth",
  "text": "<p>That is why Teva's announcement of an eye-popping settlement worth up to $4.25 billion sent its depositary receipts up 28% on Wednesday.</p><p>It isn't that the news was goodâ€”far from it. The total settlement, which must still be ratified by states, localities and tribes, was actually higher than some analysts had expected and represents a sum the already highly indebted company will have to dig very deep into its pockets to pay.</p><p>But, as Elliot Wilbur at Raymond James says, the global settlement might \"represent the final chapter of these Opioid wars, enabling investors to direct their attention to fundamentals without constantly having to chase down every new opioid litigation headline.\"</p><p>Though the Israel-based generic drugmaker's role in the opioid epidemic isn't as well known as that of Johnson &amp; Johnson or OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma, Teva was one of the biggest producers in the U.S. of copycat opioids. Teva is one of several pharmaceutical companies, drug wholesalers and retail pharmacies that have been embroiled in litigation with cities, counties, states and Native American tribes accusing them of contributing to the epidemic.</p><p>The huge settlement, which Teva has 13 years to pay down, will weigh on Teva's balance sheet. The company is already highly leveraged with net debt worth nearly 5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It will now have to devote another 10% of its net free cash flow toward paying down the cash portion of the settlement every year. That means it will have no room for growth through acquisitions, the kind of thing Teva was very good at doing until a value-destroying deal to acquire Allergan generics for $40.5 billion in 2015 saddled the company with debt.</p><p>But investors rewarded Teva on Wednesday for the clarity the settlement creates, giving the company a $10.2 billion market capitalization at the close, though that is still a far cry from the days when Teva was Israel's crown jewel, worth about $60 billion at its peak.</p><p>Looking past the settlement, there is reason to believe the company has at least avoided the abyss. The generic drug industry has started to stabilize after shrinking in recent years due to intense competition. And Chief Executive Kare Schultz, whose contract expires next year, orchestrated massive cost cuts to keep pace with falling revenues, as a key drug went off patent and competition in the generic industry intensified. The cuts allowed the company to stave off a real threat of bankruptcy.</p><p>Yet the lack of a convincing growth story will continue to make Teva a tough investment proposition once the excitement over the opioid settlement dissipates. Two of its top branded drugs, one for Huntington's disease and the other for migraines, are both showing promise. But total combined peak sales are nowhere near the revenue brought in by multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone at its $4 billion peak.</p><p>Teva may be turning a new chapter with investors, but it will remain a low-growth generics drug company for the near future, and that should keep investors from getting too excited.</p><p>Teva Tries to Put an End to the Opioid Wars</p>",
