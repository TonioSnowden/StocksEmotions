  "text": "<p>This isn't fair, especially since unions are still refusing to return to classrooms. UTLA says schools shouldn't reopen until all teachers and staff have been able to get both shots of the vaccine. Does the union plan to go on strike if they are offered a single dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine instead of a double dose of the Pfizer and Moderna shots? Don't be surprised.</p><p>UTLA's collective-bargaining agreement last spring said teachers couldn't be forced to provide live video instruction or teach more than four hours on average per day. The union finally agreed in the fall to teach using Zoom or another virtual platform to avoid returning to classrooms, but now it wants to make remote learning the new normal.</p><p>Poor black and Hispanic kids have been harmed most by school closures. It's hard getting six-year-olds to pay attention on Zoom even with a parent helping to keep them focused. But most low-income parents work outside their home, and many don't speak English. Yet UTLA claims that teachers with the privilege of working from home every day are victims of systemic racism.</p><p>\"We are being unfairly targeted by people who are not experiencing this disease in the same ways as students and families are in our communities. If this was a rich person's disease, we would've seen a very different response. We would not have the high rates of infections and deaths,\" said UTLA President Cecily Myart-Cruz Monday. She added that the impetus to reopen schools is being driven by white, wealthy parents.</p><p>Uh, no. Wealthy, white parents send their children to private schools that mostly opened last fall. Or they pay for tutoring. Or they live in tony suburbs where schools are open.</p><p>Progressive Democrats in California are the ones pushing for schools in LA and other big cities to reopen. They worry about low-income children falling ever further behind as wealthier kids advance. The self-serving standard of union first, students last is on display again.</p>",
