  "text": "<p>The advisers also are scheduled to review data on whether people who received one company's vaccine could take a booster from another company. J&amp;J's request Tuesday was to authorize a J&amp;J booster for people who had earlier taken the company's one-dose vaccine.</p><p>The request is part of a broader, but much-debated push to administer Covid-19 booster shots to address potential waning immunity from the initial vaccines, and to combat the fast spreading Delta variant.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought to roll out boosters broadly based on studies signaling waning immunity. Yet some infectious-disease experts have questioned the need for broad-based boosters, citing data that shows the original vaccines continue to protect people against severe disease even if they don't stop all infections.</p><p>The FDA in September authorized a third dose of the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE in many adults, to be given at least six months after people get the first two-doses.</p><p>Moderna Inc. also has asked the FDA to authorize a third dose, and the agency could decide on that request soon.</p><p>Unlike the two-dose vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, J&amp;J's shot was authorized in late February to be administered in a single dose to adults, based on a large international study showing it was 66% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease and 85% effective against severe to critical cases. J&amp;J has since found that a second dose, at varying intervals, could sustain protection, and has shared the data with the FDA.</p><p>The company ran a separate international study in which subjects received two doses of its vaccine 56 days apart. The study found the two-dose series was 75% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 disease overall and 94% effective in the U.S. portion of the study. And the two-dose series was 100% effective against severe to critical cases, J&amp;J said.</p><p>J&amp;J also tested a booster dose given six months after the first dose. It found that the second dose boosted levels of immune-system agents known as antibodies significantly in the weeks following the booster.</p><p>\"We look forward to our discussions with the FDA and other health authorities to support their decisions regarding boosters,\" said Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at J&amp;J's Janssen pharmaceutical unit.</p><p>The company said its single-dose vaccine remains effective against Covid-19, citing data showing the various measures of immune response were strong and stable up to eight months after vaccination.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
