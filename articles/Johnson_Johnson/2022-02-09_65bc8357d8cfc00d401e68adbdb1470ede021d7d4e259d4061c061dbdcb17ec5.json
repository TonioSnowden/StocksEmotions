  "title": "Senate Panel Scrutinizes Use of Texas Law to Shift Liabilities to Bankruptcy; The Senate Judiciary Committee is examining the use of a Texas corporate law that has let Johnson & Johnson and other companies move mass injury lawsuits to bankruptcy court",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J and a few other companies have performed corporate reshufflings under Texas law to create subsidiaries responsible for personal injury litigation, before moving those new units into bankruptcy.</p><p>The chapter 11 filings have put the mass litigation these companies face on hold, preventing injury victims from advancing their claims to juries. J&amp;J faces roughly 38,000 lawsuits alleging its talcum-based baby powder contained asbestos and caused ovarian cancer, which the company denies. It has said bankruptcy is a quicker, fairer way to reach a settlement compared to the state-court system.</p><p>A bill introduced last year by congressional Democrats would require a bankruptcy judge to dismiss chapter 11 cases filed following such a Texas reshuffling. The Texas law, a version of which is also available in Delaware, lets companies fill new subsidiaries that have limited business operations with legal liability for pending and future injury lawsuits, isolating those liabilities from the rest of the business.</p><p>\"It looks like big companies are getting away with dodging real responsibilities by using complicated trickery that ordinary people don't have access to,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) said during Tuesday's hearing.</p><p>Personal-injury lawyers whose clients blame J&amp;J's talc products for their cancer are seeking to have the bankruptcy case thrown out. A New Jersey bankruptcy judge will consider that request, which J&amp;J opposes, at a trial scheduled to begin next week.</p><p>J&amp;J has denied that the restructuring was done in bad faith or will shortchange victims. The subsidiary placed in chapter 11 has a funding agreement with J&amp;J to cover any amounts deemed to be owed to injury claimants. J&amp;J and other companies that have used the Texas law have said the restructuring and chapter 11 cases are intended to fairly and equitably compensate injury claimants.</p><p>The same legislation discussed at Tuesday's hearing would also ban bankruptcy courts from approving releases extinguishing legal claims against, corporate insiders, affiliates or owners that aren't in chapter 11 themselves, even if some affected creditors don't agree.</p><p>In recent months, federal judges in New York and Richmond, Va., have voided nonconsensual releases that would have shielded the owners of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP from civil opioid lawsuits and former executives at the previous owner of retail brands Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant from shareholder claims.</p><p>A Delaware bankruptcy judge last week approved similar releases for executives included in the chapter 11 exit plan of drugmaker Mallinckrodt PLC. Bankruptcy experts who testified in Tuesday's hearing said Congress should consider ensuring that courts across the country apply the standards for obtaining releases uniformly in chapter 11 cases.</p><p>Federal appeals courts have split on whether releases are permissible and under what circumstances. The result is that releases are allowed in some states, like Delaware, but not allowed in others, like California and Texas.</p><p>David Skeel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, told senators that any reform of nonconsensual releases should be nuanced and said an outright ban on releases would likely be a mistake because they could sometimes be used to benefit claimants and other creditors of a bankrupt company.</p><p>\"I think it would be a mistake to completely outlaw third-party releases,\" Mr. Skeel said. \"But cracking down on them, I think, makes sense.\"</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
