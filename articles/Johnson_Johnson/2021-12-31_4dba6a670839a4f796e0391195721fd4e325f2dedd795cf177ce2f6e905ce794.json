The value of deals was 54 per cent higher than in 2019 before the pandemic. </p> <p>It marks out 2021 as an exceptionally busy year, even for an industry that has been accelerating for much of the past decade. </p> <p>“In 2021 the stars aligned and virtually everything that could go right for [dealmaking] did,” said Frank Aquila, head of M&amp;A at law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. </p> <p>The M&amp;A boom also contributed to record-breaking fees for investment banks, which totalled $157bn in 2021, including $47bn in fees for M&amp;A advice, the most since records began more than two decades ago. </p> <h1>Three more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>US will respond ‘decisively' if Russia invades Ukraine</strong> President Joe Biden told Vladimir Putin that the US and its allies were prepared to respond <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/328084fe-f95f-4283-b35a-f07448c5c69f\">“decisively”</a> should Russia invade Ukraine.

It is the job of politicians rather than engineers to find the right balance between useful surveillance and dystopian nightmares” &#xa0;—&#xa0;<em>Yuval Noah Harari</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Thank you for reading First FT.
