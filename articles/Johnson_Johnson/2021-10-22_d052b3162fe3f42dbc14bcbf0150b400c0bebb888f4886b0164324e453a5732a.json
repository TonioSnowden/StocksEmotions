  "text": "<p>The FDA also is expected to post a document from the companies outlining the rationale and evidence for expanding the vaccine's use to the young children. The documents are being posted ahead of a meeting scheduled for Tuesday of a committee of vaccine experts advising the FDA.</p><p>The panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, will meet to review the evidence of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, and vote to recommend whether the FDA should authorize the use.</p><p>If the vote is in favor, FDA authorization could follow within days. And if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subsequently signs off, millions of younger children could get a Covid-19 vaccine for the first time.</p><p>There are more than 28 million children ages 5 to 11 in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech said in September that their vaccine was generally well-tolerated and induced strong immune responses in a study of nearly 2,270 children 5 to 11. Each child received two doses three weeks apart, and each shot contained one-third of the dosage used for adolescents and adults.</p><p>The vaccine induced neutralizing antibody levels in younger children that were comparable to those seen in people ages 16 to 25 who served as a control group in the study, the companies said. </p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 compound being mixed for a trial in children under 12 in August.
