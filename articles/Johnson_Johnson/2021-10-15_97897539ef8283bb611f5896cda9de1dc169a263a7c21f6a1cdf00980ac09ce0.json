  "title": "J&J Covid-19 Booster Shot Endorsed by FDA Advisers; The experts, whose recommendations are often followed by the FDA, said the agency should clear the extra dose for adults at least two months after their first shot",
  "text": "<p>The FDA could decide on whether to clear a J&amp;J booster within days.</p><p>The committee members, meeting virtually online, opted not to take a vote on whether it would be better for people to wait at least six months after the first dose to get the J&amp;J booster shot. Panel members said the evidence was too limited for whether to wait six months for the booster.</p><p>J&amp;J had requested that the FDA authorization recommend people wait six months, though they could get the booster as early as two months after the first dose. The company presented evidence showing varying effects when the booster is given between two and six months after the first dose.</p><p>The meeting is the latest by experts whose counsel the FDA has sought before making authorization decisions.</p><p>Their recommendation for J&amp;J recipients includes everyone who has received the single-dose vaccine, making it more permissive than the authorization for the booster vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, which is cleared for seniors and other high-risk adults.</p><p>The advisers voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend the FDA authorize a Moderna Inc. booster to a similar group of people as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. An FDA decision is pending.</p><p>The single-dose J&amp;J shot had lower efficacy against Covid-19 disease than the two-dose mRNA vaccines in studies. Committee members said it was important to give people who received the single shot similar protection to those who received the mRNA vaccines, which are made by Pfizer-BioNTech and by Moderna.</p><p>\"The single dose does not seem to afford as much protection as the mRNA vaccines did, so this is really with the second dose bringing it on par with those other vaccines in terms of effectiveness,\" said Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School and a member of the committee.</p><p>The FDA also is weighing whether people who first get one vaccine should get booster shots of a different vaccine. The vaccine advisory committee will discuss a study of that approach at the meeting Friday.</p><p>Preliminary data from a federal study released Wednesday suggests that people who originally got the J&amp;J vaccine would get a stronger immune response from a booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, rather than another J&amp;J dose.</p><p>The Biden administration has been pushing boosters largely to counter any waning strength of vaccines and the contagious Delta variant. But many health experts have said there isn't sufficient evidence to offer boosters to most people, beyond those who have weakened immune systems due to their age or medical condition.</p><p>J&amp;J's vaccine has been given as a single shot since it was authorized for use in the U.S. in late February, in contrast to the two-dose vaccine regimens from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Covid-19 Booster Shot Endorsed by FDA Advisers</p>",
