  "title": "Europe's Tourist Hotspots Stay Open to Americans, for Now; Many European countries haven't tightened entry rules for U.S. visitors despite an EU recommendation to curb nonessential travel",
  "text": "<p>Europe's leading tourism nations in most cases allow U.S. tourists to enter without quarantine if they can show proof of vaccination against Covid-19, recovery from the virus or a negative test result taken shortly before departure.</p><p>In Europe, decisions to allow or restrict incoming travel rest with national governments, rather than with EU institutions. Many nations are putting the needs of their tourism sectors, which have sorely missed big-spending American visitors, ahead of EU recommendations to block U.S. tourists.</p><p>The EU's decision on Monday to remove the U.S. from its list of safe countries for travel amid the pandemic reflects the growing spread of the Delta variant in the U.S., where vaccination rates have fallen behind those in many EU countries. The decision also reflects EU frustration that the U.S. hasn't reciprocated the EU's efforts to reopen trans-Atlantic travel, instead remaining closed for nonessential travel from Europe.</p><p>\"We hope no country will implement the recommendation,\" said Luís Araújo, president of the European Travel Commission, an organization that promotes travel in Europe. Monday's EU announcement is likely to cause confusion and weaken confidence among consumers and travel-related businesses, he said.</p><p>Before the pandemic, Europe's travel and tourism sector accounted for 4% of the area's economic output and for around 5% of its labor force, according to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.</p><p>Tourism is a vital sector in many Southern European countries, however, accounting for 13% of gross domestic product in Italy in 2019, 14% in Spain and 20% in Greece.</p><p>Mediterranean countries have placed high hopes on the return of international tourists this year to help them bounce back from deep pandemic-induced recessions.</p><p>Italy's tourism industry returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity in July and August, said Ivana Jelinic, chairwoman of the country's travel and tourism association Fiavet.</p><p>\"We will greatly miss Americans if they stop coming,\" she said.</p><p>Spain has had some of the lightest travel rules for U.S. tourists this summer, requiring no proof of vaccination, recovery from the virus or negative tests for Americans before entering the country. Spain's government said on Tuesday that it will maintain the same open-door policy for U.S. visitors until the end of September.</p><p>Without recovery in Spain's tourism sector, there will be no overall economic recovery, said a Spanish government official. Encouraging U.S. and Asian tourists to return is essential, the official said.</p><p>A Greek official said the country will continue to welcome U.S. visitors for the rest of the tourism season, while maintaining monitoring at Greece's borders.</p><p>Since May, Greece has allowed U.S. tourists to enter the country without quarantine if they can show they are vaccinated, have recovered from Covid-19 or have just tested negative.</p><p>Italy, which has followed the same approach on U.S. visitors as Greece this summer, has no imminent plan to change its rules, an Italian government official said.</p><p>Like Greece and Italy, France so far hasn't changed the current requirements of a proof of vaccination against Covid-19, a negative test result taken within 72 hours before departure or proof of having recovered from the disease.</p><p>An official at France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country reviews its travel lists regularly based on the latest health indicators. Travelers from countries deemed high risk still can travel to France if they have been vaccinated with a shot recognized by the EU, which are those made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer—as well as by AstraZeneca.</p><p>\"U.S. tourists are welcome to come to France,\" the French official said.</p><p>Ireland, which also has seen numerous U.S. tourists return this summer, said it won't change its rules in response to the EU recommendation. Unlike some other European countries, Ireland lets Americans enter if they can show proof of vaccination or recovery but requires them to self-isolate for a number of days if they can only show a negative test result.</p><p>Germany, Europe's largest economy and a country less dependent on tourism than its sunnier southern neighbors, hasn't changed its rules so far either.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. airline executives have been frustrated by continuing restrictions barring Europeans and others from traveling to the U.S. Some had hoped the restrictions would be lifted in time to boost summer travel to the U.S. from Europe, but the spread of the variant has complicated that.</p><p>Delta Air Lines Inc. Chief Executive Ed Bastian said Tuesday it would be \"tone deaf\" for the industry to mount a lobbying campaign for the U.S. to open borders now in light of the surge of coronavirus cases in the country, but said he hopes restrictions can be eased, at least for European and U.K. nationals, before the holiday season.</p><p>\"Europe is a safer place to be than the U.S. right now relative to the variant, and we know the vaccination rates in Europe are higher than they are in the U.S. So for the U.S. not to let European nationals into our country kind of runs against the science of it,\" he said.</p><p>Alison Sider contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com and Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com</p><p>Europe's Tourist Hotspots Stay Open to Americans, for Now</p>",
