  "title": "Sports:  Baseball Delivers Vaccine Lessons  ----  By Jared Diamond and Louise Radnofsky",
  "text": "<p>   The New York Yankees in the late spring were one of the first entities to alert the world to a troubling possibility: People who were fully vaccinated could still test positive for Covid-19. </p><p>   Now the whole country is grappling with that reality, plunging local and state governments into bitter fights over how to handle the latest phase of the pandemic after hopes were dashed that the arrival of shots would herald a rapid exit from the Covid era. </p><p>   It's the latest in a series of lessons Major League Baseball has delivered regarding the complexities of continuing to work while keeping the virus at bay. In this instance, baseball is revealing another hard reality of the pandemic: A higher percentage of MLB employees are vaccinated than the general U.S. population, and it hasn't been enough to completely prevent outbreaks. </p><p>    This chapter stars the Yankees, who have sustained a series of outbreaks in recent months despite the fact that nearly all of its players are vaccinated -- in this case, with the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson regimen. </p><p>   Epidemiologists who closely follow MLB say that what is happening in the league is a reflection of the situation across America, where about 72% of the adult population has now had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. An earlier wave of restrictions has been lifted, and Covid cases are surging again amid a significantly more contagious variant, threatening chiefly the health of the unvaccinated. </p><p>   There's one key difference between baseball and America -- MLB's continued mass testing of its employees. That stands to generate a treasure trove of data that might help researchers draw conclusions about the spread of the virus among vaccinated and unvaccinated people by picking up on breakthrough infections that don't generate any symptoms and would otherwise go unnoticed. </p><p>   \"The takeaway is that, in many ways, the experience of MLB mirrors the rest of the United States,\" said Ali Khan, dean of the college of public health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and public-health consultant to MLB. </p><p>   \"Surging community prevalence challenges vaccine efficacy and MLB is seeing more cases, clusters, and breakthrough infections. However, case numbers are highly magnified in MLB because of their diligent testing protocol that captures all asymptomatic and very mild infections. Fortunately, most illness has been mild; the players, at least, are a generally healthy lot.\" </p><p>   Twenty-three of MLB's 30 teams have reached the threshold of 85% of their Tier 1 employees being fully vaccinated, which includes players, coaches and essential staff members who are in close contact with players. </p><p>   About 86% of all Tier 1 individuals are fully vaccinated, MLB said. Many of them, including the New York Yankees, received their shots in late March and early April, around the time the season started. </p><p>   \"We applaud all the players and staff members who have chosen to get vaccinated, and we will continue to encourage those who aren't fully vaccinated to do so as soon as possible,\" MLB said. </p><p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson said in a statement that \"All authorized Covid-19 vaccines have been shown to help prevent infection and reduce the severity of illness, which is why Covid-19 vaccinations are such an important tool to help end the pandemic.\" </p><p></p>",
