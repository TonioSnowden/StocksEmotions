  "text": "<p>   The Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE safely protects children between the ages of 12 and 15, the companies said, results likely to lead to inoculations within that age group before this summer. </p><p>   The vaccine was 100% effective in protecting against symptomatic disease in a study of more than 2,200 children, the companies said Wednesday. Researchers also didn't find any safety concerns. </p><p>   The findings, though expected, were much anticipated by parents, health authorities and school officials. They have been waiting for signs on when vaccines that adults have been getting could also be made available to children. </p><p>   Like other authorized vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech shot hasn't yet been cleared for use in adolescents under 16. </p><p>   Health experts said children will need to be vaccinated for a population to move past pandemic restrictions, like masking and physical distancing. </p><p>   Given the Pfizer-BioNTech results, adolescents in the U.S., at least, could start getting vaccinated as early as May, according to a person familiar with the matter. This would mean many would have the protection in time for attending camps and engaging in other summer activities. </p><p>   Andrew Schwartz, 45, an ophthalmologist who lives in Port Washington, N.Y., said he planned to get his kids -- ages 10, 12, and 15 -- vaccinated when he can. \"I'm excited,\" said Dr. Schwartz, who along with his wife, was already vaccinated. \"The kids have been a big missing piece of the puzzle.\" </p><p>   He acknowledges having some reservations about the limited clinical data, but is comfortable given the risk of Covid-19. \"I trust the science,\" he said. </p><p>   Pfizer said it would ask U.S. health regulators in the coming weeks to expand use of the shots to 12- to 15-year-olds. </p><p>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant Pfizer and BioNTech the additional authorization two to four weeks after receiving the application. Pfizer and BioNTech said they would seek clearance in other countries, too, but didn't give a timetable. </p><p>   The vaccine was authorized for use in those 16 and older in the U.S. in December, after a pivotal trial involving 44,000 people. Pfizer started last week testing the vaccine in children ages 6 months to 11 years. </p><p>   \"We share the urgency to expand the authorization of our vaccine to use in younger populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15,\" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said. </p><p>   Covid-19 vaccination efforts in the U.S. and overseas have focused on protecting older adults who are at higher risk of severe disease caused by the coronavirus. </p><p>   Children are at lower risk of contracting the coronavirus than adults. When they are infected, they tend to experience milder symptoms. Some can get seriously ill, however, and some can also spread the virus. </p><p>   Health authorities said it would be important to vaccinate children, not only to protect them from the virus but also to help reach the communitywide immunity needed to move past the pandemic. </p><p>   Children make up about 13% of Covid-19 cases in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. </p><p>   The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is given in two doses three weeks apart. It is among three Covid-19 shots authorized for use in the U.S., along with ones from Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. </p><p>   The vaccines from Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson are authorized in the U.S. for use in adults 18 and older. Moderna also is testing its vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds and said its trial is fully enrolled. </p><p>   In the Pfizer-BioNTech study of younger adolescents, 1,131 of the subjects received the vaccine, while the rest got a placebo. The volunteers who got the vaccine received the same dose that older people get. </p><p>   Researchers found the shot to be 100% effective after observing 18 cases of Covid-19 in children who had received a placebo, compared with no cases in the group that got vaccinated, Pfizer said. Researchers didn't see any severe cases, deaths or hospitalizations, the company also said. </p><p>   Researchers also said an unspecified number of vaccinated children had more neutralizing antibodies a month after receiving their second dose than subjects 16 to 25 years of age had in the vaccine's pivotal trial. Neutralizing antibodies prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Thomas M. Burton contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
