  "text": "<p><strong>One invitation to start: </strong>For our next DD forum, Ortenca Aliaj is delving into the steady migration of Spacs to Europe and beyond. And who better to discuss with than Spac sponsors and former chief executives of Credit Suisse and UniCredit: Tidjane Thiam and Jean Pierre Mustier, respectively.&#xa0;</p> <p>Full details and registration for the event on March 31 can be found <a href=\"https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;partnerref=DD&amp;eventid=3080916&amp;sessionid=1&amp;key=C8CC16F394D50B17363E0B206525C0D9&amp;regTag=&amp;V2=false&amp;sourcepage=register\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance from the Financial Times.

The shares have cooled off sharply since the deal was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/299c38f9-538e-4d70-9882-59f08242e9cb\">rumoured in January and announced</a> last month, when social media hype sent Churchill as high as $60.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Muddy Waters launched an attack against <strong>XL Fleet</strong>, a hybrid-truck start-up that Block <a href=\"https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/xl/mw-is-short-xl/\">alleges</a> misled investors with inflated sales pipelines after it merged with a Spac in December. Its stock slumped 20 per cent when the short-seller report was released.</p> <p>And just last week, short-seller <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong> <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/\">alleged</a> that electric truck start-up <strong>Lordstown Motors</strong>, which merged with a Spac in October, had mislead investors with “fake orders” and “undisclosed production hurdles”. Hindenburg is the short-seller whose reports previously fuelled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/168be1c5-5f54-473f-b373-096b8a511ba9\">due diligence concerns</a> over <strong>Nikola</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lordstown's chief executive <strong>Steve Burns</strong> told investors on Wednesday that the company was complying with an information request from the SEC.</p> <p>Then there's anointed Spac king <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong>, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1357802154510090241\">favourite target</a> among short-sellers.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Clover Health</strong>, the healthcare company he took public via a blank-cheque merger last year, is now under investigation by the SEC after Hindenburg launched an attack <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f913a5a-a6ef-436b-8b58-4a4804665e70\">last month</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Roughly 25 per cent of the outstanding shares in <strong>Social Capital Hedosophia V</strong>, the fifth Spac set up by Palihapitiya and his partner <strong>Ian Osborne</strong> that will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a210a3ed-c3e3-4ed2-af50-b598dd99aaf8\">soon merge</a> with fintech company <strong>SoFi</strong>, have been sold short according to <a href=\"https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IPOE\">data</a> from <strong>Finviz</strong>.</p> <p>Despite the growing number of sceptics out there, the latest numbers tell us they're still the exception to the rule.&#xa0;</p> <p>The real question is not whether Spacs will go away anytime soon but whether there's enough institutional money out here to keep fuelling the fire.&#xa0;</p> <h2>AstraZeneca fights suspicions of a bad batch&#xa0;</h2> <p>Here at DD we typically look at the finance side of big stories.&#xa0;</p> <p>But in this item, the FT's Donato Paolo Mancini takes you under the surface of what is going one with the Oxford/AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine in Europe.&#xa0;</p> <p>It begins with a New Jersey-based contract drugmaker called <strong>Catalent</strong>, a company that&#xa0;drugmakers have turned to as they race to meet the demand for the vaccine.</p> <p>Catalent has partnered with <strong>AstraZeneca </strong>to manufacture its vaccine in Anagni, Italy, and is currently planning a large expansion of its production lines to churn out <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>'s shot in Europe.</p> <p>But the drug manufacturer is now the subject of an investigation by the <strong>European Medicines Agency</strong>, as the EU drugs regulator investigates whether there could have been manufacturing defects in specific batches of Catalent's AstraZeneca vaccines, Donato and Hannah Kuchler <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cae6639-5766-47af-8727-f1819082d6c7\">report</a>.</p> <p>The two companies have vigorously defended their manufacturing processes, with reports of possible side-effects, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1a99f4f-70ad-4477-a366-53a7cb5900d6\">blood clots</a>. This has led at least 16 European countries to halt or limit the use of the Covid-19 jab developed with Oxford university.&#xa0;</p> <p>So far, it must be emphasised that no evidence of causality exists. The EMA and the <strong>World Health Organization</strong> have stressed the vaccine's benefits far outweigh its risks. Because the events are across Europe, it is unlikely this is a batch-specific occurrence.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it can't be ruled out, the EMA has warned, so it's investigating the hypothesis as due diligence.</p> <p>The AstraZeneca/Catalent <a href=\"https://www.catalent.com/catalent-news/catalent-signs-agreement-with-astrazeneca-to-manufacture-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/\">deal was signed</a> last June, and it's likely the collaboration will continue, though the European success of the jab hinges on the verdict from the EMA's safety probe, which is expected to come out on Thursday.</p> <p>And not to mention that AstraZeneca significantly underestimated its supply projections for Europe, meaning its supply chains on the continent are especially dependent on third-party manufacturers. The UK's NHS warns there could be a squeeze on supply for the next month amid the threat of strict export controls from the EU.&#xa0;</p> <p>The UK and EU's vaccine supply chains are deeply interconnected, so a bottleneck in one place will probably be felt elsewhere.</p> <p>Either way, it looks like AstraZeneca won't be out of the news for a while.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Colin Huang</strong>, the founder of Chinese ecommerce group <strong>Pinduoduo</strong>, has unexpectedly quit his role as chair to explore “new, long-term opportunities”. The company has appointed <strong>Chen Lei</strong>, who took on the title of chief executive in July and was a classmate of Huang's at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as its new chair. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94a39cee-fc41-44c7-9abe-a79ffa30ab96\">More here</a>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Shearman &amp; Sterling</strong> has hired <strong>Philip Cheveley</strong> as an M&amp;A partner in London.
