  "title": "Banking & Finance: Some Companies Use New Legal Strategy to Reduce Claims",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J, Georgia-Pacific, Trane and Saint-Gobain haven't filed for bankruptcy. But they have used a Texas law to shift at least 250,000 personal-injury cases to bankruptcy court through newly created subsidiaries with limited business operations, a strategy developed by law firm Jones Day, court records show.</p><p>The Texas law let the companies fill their new subsidiaries with legal liability for pending and future injury litigation before those units filed for chapter 11.</p><p>The bankruptcies have paused pending lawsuits either against the parent companies or their U.S. affiliates, locking injury claimants out of the tort system and preventing them, at least for now, from putting their claims to juries.</p><p>These four companies are receiving legal and financial benefits from chapter 11 without risking the likely loss of equity value that would come from placing whole business divisions in bankruptcy. The legal strategy will be put on trial in a New Jersey bankruptcy court later this month as personal-injury lawyers seek to dismiss the bankruptcy case filed in October by a J&amp;J subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, to drive a settlement of roughly 38,000 cancer lawsuits over its talc-based products.</p><p>Some personal-injury lawyers and academics have said that J&amp;J is abusing the bankruptcy system by shifting legal liabilities to a shell company with limited business operations. They have said LTL was created solely to benefit its owner and stockholders and to sap tort claimants' negotiating leverage</p><p>\"This is an attack on the American tort system,\" said Bruce Markell, a Northwestern Pritzker School of Law professor and retired bankruptcy judge who is among several academics urging a bankruptcy judge to dismiss LTL's chapter 11 case.</p><p>J&amp;J has denied that the restructuring was done in bad faith or will shortchange victims. The subsidiary in chapter 11 has a funding agreement with its parent company to cover any amounts it is deemed to owe.</p><p>A J&amp;J spokeswoman said that LTL's bankruptcy filing \"follows established process, and courts have uniformly acknowledged that equitably resolving these types of claims through chapter 11 is a legitimate use of the restructuring process.\"</p><p>J&amp;J said in 2020 it would stop selling its talcum-powder-based products in the U.S. and Canada, citing a decline in demand fueled by changing consumer habits and \"misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising.\" In court papers, J&amp;J has said it could face new talc lawsuits for decades to come.</p><p>Law firm Jones Day didn't respond to requests for comment about the legal strategy.</p><p>Willie Gregory, who said his wife, Sonna Gregory, died in May from ovarian cancer at the age of 59, said he was shocked when he learned of the bankruptcy filing by LTL. Mr. Gregory, 55, said his wife used Johnson's Baby Powder for nearly 30 years up until about 1990 and was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. A lawsuit they filed against J&amp;J in 2020, now on pause, blames the use of its talc-based products for the cancer developed by his wife, who was a longtime commissioner for Georgia's Clayton County.</p><p>J&amp;J has denied liability in Mr. Gregory's lawsuit, one of his lawyers said. The J&amp;J spokeswoman said that Johnson's Baby Powder is safe and doesn't contain asbestos or cause cancer.</p><p>Georgia-Pacific, owned by Koch Industries Inc., also used Texas law to shift about 64,000 pending asbestos cases as well as future liability arising from past sales of gypsum plaster products into a subsidiary before placing it in chapter 11 in 2017. Georgia-Pacific declined to comment.</p><p>Trane didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>These companies have said they put corporate affiliates into chapter 11 to fairly and equitably compensate asbestos victims and resolve costly litigation arising from asbestos-containing products they stopped producing decades ago.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
