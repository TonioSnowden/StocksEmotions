  "title": "OSHA Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate: What to Know; Workers at larger private-sector businesses must get vaccinated or undergo regular Covid-19 testing",
  "text": "<p>What is OSHA's Covid-19 vaccine mandate?</p><p>The requirements released Thursday by the Labor Department implement a vaccine directive that President Biden announced in September. They apply to employers with 100 or more employees. Companies subject to the rules must ensure that employees get vaccinated. Those who aren't vaccinated against Covid-19 must produce a negative test at least weekly and wear a mask in the workplace.</p><p>Who falls under President Biden's new Covid-19 mandate?</p><p>The Biden administration says workers at companies with at least 100 employees will need to get vaccinated or produce a negative Covid-19 test weekly. The administration estimates the rule will cover 84 million workers. It has separately required vaccinations for federal employees and federal contractors. More than 17 million workers must get vaccinated under a federal requirement for workers in health facilities that get Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.</p><p>When does the vaccine mandate go into effect?</p><p>Employers have until Jan. 4, 2022, to ensure their employees are vaccinated. After that date, employers must verify that unvaccinated employees test negative for Covid-19 at least once a week. If an employee tests positive for the virus, they can't be in the workplace. By Dec. 5, employers must also ensure that unvaccinated employees wear a mask in the workplace.</p><p>Is the vaccine mandate legal?</p><p>There is uncertainty around the legality of vaccine mandates. Both the federal contractor mandate and private-sector one have drawn opposition from states led by Republican leaders. Lawsuits challenging the requirements have been filed in courts around the country. Challengers in the case before the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans include both private employers and a group of Republican state attorneys general.</p><p>Who is exempt from the vaccine mandate?</p><p>Unvaccinated workers can seek exemptions for medical or religious reasons. People with certain medical conditions for whom vaccinations might be harmful could be exempt from the rule. Individuals who hold certain religious beliefs might also be exempt under the protections of federal civil rights law.</p><p>If an unvaccinated worker receives an exemption to get vaccinated, do they still have to get tested weekly for Covid-19?</p><p>Unvaccinated employees must undergo weekly testing. If testing conflicts with an employee's religious beliefs, they might be eligible for an exemption.</p><p>Will the vaccine mandate apply to employers in the public sector?</p><p>OSHA's rule applies to larger companies in the private sector. However, many states operate their own workforce safety agencies covering state-and-local government employers. Those states must adopt vaccine rules—including for public-sector employees—at least as rigorous as the federal standard.</p><p>What proof of vaccination do private-sector workers need to show?</p><p>Employees need to show they are fully vaccinated, meaning they either received two doses of Pfizer or Moderna or one Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. Acceptable documents include a record of immunization from a health provider or pharmacy; a copy of a U.S. Covid-19 vaccination card; medical records; immunization records from public health, state or tribal immunization information system; or a copy of other official documentation that contains the type and dates of vaccination. When documentation can't be obtained, a signed and dated statement from the employee attesting to his or her vaccination status is permitted.</p><p>How will OSHA ensure that employers are complying with the regulation?</p><p>OSHA will conduct some workplace inspections. But the agency, as is typically the practice, will rely primarily on worker complaints to check compliance with its regulations, senior administration officials said. Workers concerned that their workplaces aren't following the mandate can file complaints with OSHA through an online form or phone call.</p><p>After receiving a complaint, OSHA likely will contact the employer and ask for records on vaccination and testing, said David Michaels, a former OSHA head who is now a professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health. Depending on the significance of the problem, OSHA might send an inspector, he said.</p><p>What penalties do employers who don't comply face for not complying with the mandate?</p><p>OSHA can issue fines against employers, which are determined by whether there are willful violations and how often violations occur. There is a standard penalty of up to $13,653 for a single violation, such as failure to provide paid leave or not having a vaccination program, rather than levying such a fine per-employee out of compliance.</p><p>Multiple fines are possible if there are numerous violations, senior administration officials said. Willful violations can lead to a maximum penalty of $136,532 per violation.</p><p>What will happen to unvaccinated workers who object to getting vaccinated or tested weekly?</p><p>President Biden's mandate doesn't explicitly require employers to lay off workers who don't comply. It also doesn't prevent employers from doing so. The Labor Department recommends employers \"consult applicable law\" before making personnel decisions. Some workers may choose to quit. Slightly under 40% of workers who are unvaccinated say they would leave their job if getting the Covid-19 vaccine was mandated by their employer or if they were required to get tested for the virus weekly, according to survey results from the Kaiser Family Foundation Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor.</p><p>What happens in states where the federal vaccine mandate conflicts with state mandates?</p><p>The federal government's vaccine mandate trumps any inconsistent state or local laws, including ones that hinder employers' authority to require vaccinations, masks or testing, the Biden administration said. In Texas, for instance, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, issued an executive order banning businesses and other private entities in the state from requiring Covid-19 vaccinations for employees.</p><p>Do workers get paid time off for vaccinations?</p><p>Yes. Employers will need to pay workers for the time it takes to get vaccinated. They will also need to offer paid sick leave for individuals who experience side effects from the vaccine.</p><p>Who will pay for weekly Covid-19 tests for unvaccinated employees?</p><p>It depends. Employers don't need to provide or pay for the weekly Covid-19 tests, meaning that unvaccinated workers in some cases will likely need to pay for their own tests. Employers might be required to fund testing in certain scenarios involving, for instance, collective bargaining agreements, the administration said. Further, some employers might choose to cover the testing costs to retain workers in a tight labor market.</p><p>Are unvaccinated workers who previously had Covid-19 considered fully vaccinated?</p><p>No, the regulation doesn't make exceptions for unvaccinated people who had the virus and developed antibodies.</p><p>Write to Sarah Chaney Cambon at sarah.chaney@wsj.com</p><p>OSHA Covid-19 Vaccine Mandate: What to Know</p>",
