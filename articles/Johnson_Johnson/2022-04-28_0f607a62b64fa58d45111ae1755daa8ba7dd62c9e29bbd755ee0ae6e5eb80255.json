  "title": "Shareholder Proposals to Broaden Access to Covid-19 Vaccines Rejected; Investors in Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson voted down shareholder proposals aimed at boosting supplies to poorer countries",
  "text": "<p>Shareholders at Pfizer and Moderna voted against similar resolutions, which asked each company to study the feasibility of transferring technical know-how and patents to allow other manufacturers to produce Covid-19 vaccine doses for low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>The resolutions were submitted by antipoverty group Oxfam America and other socially conscious investors who argued the vaccine makers have steered much of their dose supplies to wealthier countries.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said two shareholder proposals related to vaccine access didn't pass in votes tallied at its annual meeting. The company didn't immediately release the vote count.</p><p>Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, introduced Oxfam's proposal in a prerecorded statement during Moderna's annual meeting, which like the other companies' meetings was held virtually because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>WHO has sponsored a vaccine manufacturing hub in South Africa that is trying to replicate Moderna's vaccine, and Dr. Tedros said Moderna has declined to share technical know-how for the effort.</p><p>\"We urge Moderna to share technology and know-how with the WHO hub and commit to not enforcing patents for Covid-19 and other essential vaccines in countries hosting the WHO hub and spokes,\" Dr. Tedros said.</p><p>Moderna Chairman Noubar Afeyan said the company has expanded its manufacturing capacity and is committed to providing vaccine doses globally. He said some lower-income regions have declined shipments of doses. The company also has pledged not to enforce its vaccine-related patents in more than 90 lower- and middle-income countries.</p><p>J&amp;J shareholders were asked to vote on a proposal asking the company to report on how J&amp;J set policies affecting access to its Covid-19 vaccine, specifically pricing. The proposal asked the company to report on whether its receipt of financial support from the U.S. government affected those policies.</p><p>J&amp;J shareholders also voted on a second proposal, which asked the company to publish a report on the public health costs created by limited sharing of J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine technologies.</p><p>J&amp;J said about 70% of its global vaccine supply in 2021 was made available—either directly or through government donations—to low- and middle-income countries. J&amp;J said it will continue to focus on vaccine access in countries with the greatest need.</p><p>Pfizer said that one billion of the three billion Covid-19 vaccine doses it manufactured in 2021 were for low- and middle-income countries, and it remains committed to ensuring broad access to the shot.</p><p>Shareholders meeting stock ownership criteria may submit proposals on various aspects of a company's governance, in addition to routine matters that companies put to a vote, such as electing directors and ratifying auditors.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>Shareholder Proposals to Broaden Access to Covid-19 Vaccines Rejected</p>",
