  "text": "<p>Pfizer and BioNTech have become the first vaccine makers to seek US authorisation for using their Covid-19 jab on adolescents, in an effort to expand vaccinations beyond adults as officials seek to get students back into classrooms as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The companies on Friday said they had requested emergency use authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration for adolescents aged 12 to 15. Last week, they reported that a phase 3 trial of the jab on 2,260 young teenagers aged 12 to 15 had shown <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96682e34-ac34-4201-8473-cea4f6e38f91\">100 per cent efficacy</a> and a strong antibody response.&#xa0;</p> <p>The BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is already authorised in the US for individuals aged over 16, and the drugmakers said that side-effects from the trial were “generally consistent” with those seen in 16- to 25-year-olds.</p> <p>The companies said they planned to request authorisation from other regulators in the coming days, representing “a critical step in Pfizer's and BioNTech's ongoing efforts to support governments in broadening global vaccination efforts”.</p> <p>Vaccinating children could instil greater confidence in a mass return to classrooms, with many schools currently providing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5213397b-cc0f-477c-80b5-8193bf718491\">mix</a> of in-person and online learning. </p> <p>Schools in many areas of the US have remained fully or partially closed since the start of the pandemic as the spread of infection deterred teachers and parents from a complete return to face-to-face teaching.</p> <p>Pfizer and BioNTech last month began dosing even younger children with the vaccine, aged six months to 11 years, while other drugmakers are also at various stages of testing their jabs on children. </p> <p>Moderna's trial on children aged six months to less than 12 years is in progress, while Johnson &amp; Johnson is trialling its single-dose shot on teenagers aged 12 to 17, starting with 16- to 17-year-olds.</p> <p>This week, a trial of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on children was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9748269c-3f40-40e5-9606-2d2cc0d4946f\">paused</a> while the UK regulator investigated links between the jab and blood clots in adults.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in London 2021 'Pfizer and BioNTech seek US vaccine authorisation for adolescents' FT.com 9 April.
