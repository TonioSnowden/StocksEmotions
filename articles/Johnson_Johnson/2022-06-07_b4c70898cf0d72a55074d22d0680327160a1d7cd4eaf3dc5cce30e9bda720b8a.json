  "title": "Business News:  J&J Says Covid-Shot  Deal Is Off in Dispute  ----  By Peter Loftus and Will Feuer",
  "text": "<p>    Johnson &amp; Johnson said Monday it planned to terminate its Covid-19 vaccine supply deal with contract manufacturer Emergent BioSolutions Inc., as both companies accused each other of breaching the agreement. </p><p>   J&amp;J informed Emergent last week  of its plan to terminate the 2020 manufacturing agreement \"based on Emergent's breaches, including failure to supply Covid-19 vaccine drug substance,\" J&amp;J said in a written statement. </p><p>   J&amp;J provided a formal notice of termination and breach to Emergent on Monday, J&amp;J said. </p><p>   The contract disclosure Monday came after Emergent BioSolutions said in a securities filing that it had sent a notice of material breach of the agreement to J&amp;J. </p><p>   Emergent, of Gaithersburg, Md., said J&amp;J failed to provide requisite forecasts of the required quantity of vaccines to be purchased, and that J&amp;J doesn't plan to purchase the minimum quantity of product detailed in the initial 2020 agreement. </p><p>   Emergent also said J&amp;J intends to wind down the contract without fulfilling its minimum requirements. </p><p>   J&amp;J has 30 days to comply with the contract before Emergent has the right to terminate the agreement, Emergent said. The contract manufacturer said J&amp;J would owe between $125 million and $420 million if the contract were now terminated. </p><p>   In response, J&amp;J said Emergent's securities filing \"is false and misleading both with respect to the contrived breach allegation against Johnson &amp; Johnson and in its failure to disclose our prior notice that Johnson &amp; Johnson would terminate the supply agreement.\" </p><p>   Emergent didn't respond to a request for comment regarding J&amp;J's description of the securities filing. </p><p>   J&amp;J, of New Brunswick, N.J., sells one of three Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S., though health authorities recently limited the use of J&amp;J's vaccine because of concerns about the risk of a rare but serious blood-clotting condition. </p><p>   The company said it has sufficient capacity from other manufacturing plants. </p><p>   Emergent was to help J&amp;J meet demand for the vaccine. Emergent said it had agreed under its contract with J&amp;J to provide Covid-19 vaccine development and manufacturing services for up to five years. It said the contract was valued at about $480 million in the first two contract years. </p><p>   The contract manufacturer experienced contamination problems at its plant in Baltimore, which resulted in the destruction of key ingredients that would have amounted to roughly 400 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from J&amp;J and AstraZeneca PLC, according to a recent congressional committee report. </p><p></p>",
