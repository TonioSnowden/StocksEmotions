  "title": "Police Departments Strive to Persuade Officers to Get Covid-19 Vaccine; Covid is leading cause of death among police, surpassing gunfire, but resistance persists",
  "text": "<p>Covid-19 is now the leading killer of law enforcement officers in the U.S., according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a nonprofit that tracks police officer deaths. Since January 2020, 414 have died from the disease, compared with 92 from gunfire, the second leading cause of death.</p><p>In Los Angeles, 47% of the police department's 12,000 employees were fully vaccinated as of Sept. 3, a department spokesman said, compared with 68% of all L.A. county residents 12 or older. In San Diego, those rates are 50%, compared with 78%. In New York City, 61% of officers have gotten at least one vaccine dose, compared with 81% of all residents 12 and over.</p><p>In Seattle, the police union president recently warned that officers could lose their jobs when a vaccination mandate goes into effect Oct 18.</p><p>\"Many police executives are concerned about the low rate of vaccination and are diligently trying to move the needle on this issue,\" said Art Acevedo, Miami's police chief and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents chiefs from around the country.</p><p>Police officers have given a host of reasons for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19, including not wanting to be forced into it or skepticism over vaccine safety.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE's Covid-19 vaccine and given emergency use authorization to vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>In addition, some research has shown that when vaccinated people are infected with Covid-19, they carry smaller amounts of the virus than unvaccinated people, making it less likely they will spread it. Officials have said that is another reason police officers, who often interact with the public, should be vaccinated.</p><p>Free vaccines are being offered at clinics in some cities for officers and other public employees. Police chiefs have sought to persuade their officers by likening vaccination to other common safety measures for the profession such as body armor and seat belts. As an incentive, some cities are giving extra time off to vaccinated employees.</p><p>Cities mandating that public employees including police be vaccinated by sometime this fall, or in some cases accepting weekly Covid-19 testing, include New York, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif.</p><p>Dave Gutierrez, a 53-year-old retired sergeant who was serving as a reserve officer in San Jose, said he quit last Sunday rather than get vaccinated by the Sept. 30 deadline.</p><p>\"To force somebody to do something, you're losing the freedom,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Gutierrez, who had been an officer for 29 years, said he is concerned about side effects from the vaccine.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Should cities enforce vaccination for municipal workers? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Police officers are hired to look at things from all different angles, and a lot of times we could be skeptical,\" he said. \"I don't think they're giving enough information.\"</p><p>Some officers are trying to find ways around the mandates. In Los Angeles, about 3,000 police employees have said they intend to seek a religious or medical exemption, according to city data.</p><p>The union representing officers in Los Angeles has proposed that officers be allowed to take weekly tests as an alternative to the vaccine, a union spokesman said. Six LAPD employees sued the city earlier in September, claiming the vaccine mandate violates their constitutional rights and asking the court to block the city from enforcing it.</p><p>The officers are being represented by the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal defense group that has fought for broad religious exemptions to vaccine mandates.</p><p>\"We're talking about officers who have strong convictions in their heart that their faith or God doesn't want them to take this vaccine,\" said Brad Dacus, founder of the Pacific Justice Institute.</p><p>A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p><p>\"We will continue pushing forward because getting more people vaccinated is our only way out of this pandemic,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement in response to the lawsuit.</p><p>In August, a San Diego police officer posted on Facebook a preference to lose the job rather than get vaccinated.</p><p>\"Myself and other God Fearing patriots on this Department are building up a coalition of Cops who will stand up for our God given freedoms and are willing to risk it all,\" the officer wrote. \"From this point forward, we will never take the vaccine, be tested or wear another face diaper around our heads without our free will to make that choice.\"</p><p>Lt. Adam Sharki, a spokesman for the department, said it was reviewing the post to determine whether the officer, who hasn't been identified by the department, violated policy.</p><p>Jack Schaeffer, president of the San Diego Police Officers Association, said the union is negotiating with the city over the mandate because officers want sufficient exemptions and an option for testing. He declined to comment on the Facebook post.</p><p>Other public employees also are resisting. More than 500 firefighters in Los Angeles filed suit this month over the mandate, alleging the city doesn't have the authority to \"force anyone to take an experimental vaccine against his or her will.\"</p><p>In Washington, state troopers, firefighters and other public employees sued Gov. Jay Inslee in state court in September over a vaccine mandate for state workers, arguing that the governor is exceeding his authority.</p><p>\"These requirements are both legal and appropriate to protect the public,\" said Mike Faulk, a spokesman for Mr. Inslee. \"It's not unreasonable to ask public servants to help alleviate the public's suffering in this pandemic.\"</p><p>Write to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com</p><p>Police Departments Strive to Persuade Officers to Get Covid-19 Vaccine</p>",
