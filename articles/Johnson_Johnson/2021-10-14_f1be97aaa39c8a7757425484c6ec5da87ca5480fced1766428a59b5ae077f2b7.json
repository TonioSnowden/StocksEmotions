  "title": "How Bankruptcy Could Help Johnson & Johnson Corral Vast Talc Litigation; The company has isolated its talc liabilities in a subsidiary and put them in bankruptcy, which legal experts say could prompt injury claimants to settle",
  "text": "<p>How could J&amp;J place talc liabilities in bankruptcy?</p><p>Dividing assets from liabilities is possible under a Texas corporate law through what are known as divisive mergers or divisional mergers. They have been used in recent years by several companies facing large numbers of asbestos claims to silo those injury liabilities into newly formed units that were then placed in chapter 11.</p><p>On Tuesday, J&amp;J created a new North Carolina-based subsidiary called LTL Management LLC, according to a filing with the secretary of state, and placed the newly formed entity into chapter 11 on Thursday.</p><p>J&amp;J said the bankruptcy will provide a process for fairly resolving its talc liability. The company said it plans to create a $2 billion trust and allocate royalty revenue streams to LTL Management valued at $350 million.</p><p>Injury claimants have said an affiliate bankruptcy would open a path for J&amp;J to resolve the talc claims through chapter 11 without the backlash from financial markets that could come from placing its entire business in bankruptcy.</p><p>What would a bankruptcy mean for the talc cases?</p><p>Bankruptcy gives companies several tools to drive settlements of all of the liability claims they face now or in the future over products that allegedly cause injuries or are defective in some way. After a bankruptcy filing, lawsuits in every state and federal court are automatically paused and brought before a single bankruptcy judge.</p><p>There were roughly 34,600 lawsuits as of July against J&amp;J alleging that talcum powder in Johnson's Baby Powder and Johnson's Shower to Shower can cause inflammation that leads to cancer. Other complaints allege the talc products were contaminated with asbestos. J&amp;J has denied a link between talc use and ovarian cancer, and said that numerous studies of its baby powder haven't shown a presence of asbestos.</p><p>A bankruptcy filing covering the talc liabilities would likely halt pending lawsuits, at least for a while, and protect J&amp;J from further jury trials. J&amp;J has signaled that only a subsidiary housing the talc claims would file for bankruptcy, rather than the publicly traded parent company and its other business lines, according to people familiar with the matter. But J&amp;J could receive the benefit of the automatic stay even if only an affiliate sought chapter 11.</p><p>A chapter 11 filing would provide a centralized forum for personal injury claims to be evaluated and capped at a certain amount, possibly by estimating the compensation due to claimants. That is attractive for J&amp;J because litigation exposure can be hard for companies to price, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law.</p><p>J&amp;J has taken some talc-injury cases to trial in state courts, and while some juries have sided with the company, others have returned huge damage awards, including a $2.1 billion judgment in Missouri.</p><p>\"If I have a really wide variance, it makes it really hard to predict the next case,\" Ms. Lahav said. \"So this is an attempt to put a cap on it through bankruptcy.\"</p><p>In a bankruptcy, J&amp;J would get to choose its preferred venue, rather than defending claims in the courts where they are filed. Filing for chapter 11 also would pressure claimants to accept lower settlements than they might otherwise, since they could otherwise be stuck in bankruptcy court for years, with no chance of advancing their claims elsewhere, Ms. Lahav said. The company announced last year that it would stop selling Johnson's Baby Powder made with talc in the U.S. and Canada, citing a decline in customer demand amid the safety concerns.</p><p>Talc claims are nevertheless expected to grow in coming years as more people are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and asbestos disease and allege a link to J&amp;J's products. In bankruptcy, J&amp;J has the opportunity to effectively resolve both current and future litigation in one chapter 11 proceeding and put the talc lawsuits behind it for good, legal experts said. If a supermajority of injury claimants accepts a settlement offer from J&amp;J, the rest of the litigants could be bound by it as well.</p><p>\"When it's done, it is done,\" said Lindsey Simon, an assistant professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.</p><p>A bankruptcy deal would get compensation to many victims more quickly compared with litigation, according to legal experts.</p><p>\"Victims don't want to sit and wait for 10 years while this slowly meanders its way through the court system,\" said Samir Parikh, a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School.</p><p>Have other companies used this strategy?</p><p>Koch Industries Inc.'s Georgia-Pacific LLC in 2017 used a Texas divisive merger to break off an affiliate that housed asbestos-related liabilities, which then filed for bankruptcy. In 2019, Saint-Gobain Group's CertainTeed LLC similarly split off an asbestos affiliate shortly before placing it in bankruptcy. Trane Technologies PLC followed last year, creating new units to shuttle two subsidiaries' asbestos liabilities into chapter 11.</p><p>In those instances, the bankrupt units were supported by commitments from their parent companies to cover asbestos claims that were determined to be valid through the chapter 11 process. Company lawyers said that with guaranteed funding valid claims will be paid in full, with the bankruptcy causing no harm to injury victims.</p><p>Injury claimants have disputed that, saying that funding commitments from CertainTeed and Trane weren't as ironclad as advertised.</p><p>Are there risks for J&amp;J?</p><p>In August, a North Carolina bankruptcy judge ruled that CertainTeed and Trane might have crossed a legal line by creating corporate vessels with no purpose other than to shuttle asbestos liabilities into bankruptcy. Those bankruptcy cases remain pending. J&amp;J could face a similar challenge from talc claimants, depending on how it allocates and funds its liabilities.</p><p>If injury claimants are dissatisfied with settlement talks, they could also seek to lift the stay on litigation against J&amp;J. If granted, that would allow proceedings in state courts to resume, once again exposing J&amp;J to jury verdicts and defense costs.</p><p>There are also reputational risks, as the use of bankruptcy to resolve large-scale legal liability can be controversial. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP sparked a backlash in Congress by using a bankruptcy plan to settle lawsuits over opioid addiction and provide legal releases to its wealthy family owners.</p><p>Congressional Democrats have also taken an interest in J&amp;J's bankruptcy planning. A House Oversight subcommittee asked J&amp;J for documents and information in July on any company plans to place a subsidiary into bankruptcy. Other lawmakers have proposed cracking down on the use of divisive mergers ahead of bankruptcies. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) would require bankruptcy cases stemming from divisional mergers to be dismissed, under some circumstances.</p><p>Can talc claimants stop a bankruptcy filing?</p><p>Some talc lawyers have sought court rulings to pre-emptively bar J&amp;J from breaking off talc liabilities through a divisive merger, which they view as a likely first step toward bankruptcy. A judge in Delaware refused in August to issue a restraining order against J&amp;J. Another such request is pending in New Jersey.</p><p>J&amp;J has said its corporate governance shouldn't be \"hijacked\" based on speculation about what it might do and the possible effect on talc claims.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com, Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com and Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
