  "text": "<p>Monday's decision prompted many parents to call their pediatricians and ask them whether they would administer vaccines to children under 12. The FDA 's approval generally means vaccines are eligible for off-label use, meaning beyond approved populations, but the CDC said they aren't authorizing that.</p><p>Pfizer 's vaccine is authorized for emergency use for children aged 12 and up and fully approved for those 16 and up. Moderna Inc .'s and Johnson &amp; Johnson 's shots are authorized only for those 18 and over and aren't fully approved.</p><p>Parents are reporting mixed success. Some say they have been able to schedule appointments, while others say they have been refused.</p><p>Patti Mulligan, 44 years old, says she called her pediatrician's office Monday as soon as she heard the FDA approval news. She was able to schedule a first dose for her 9-year-old daughter on Wednesday.</p><p>\"I don't have any hesitation. I've been trying to get my daughter into a trial unsuccessfully. I am just ready to get her more protected as soon as possible,\" says Ms. Mulligan, who lives in Raleigh, N.C.</p><p>The FDA and CDC cited the absence of safety data for the vaccine in children under 12 as the reason for advising against it. The CDC said a different dosage likely would be required and pointed to Pfizer 's plans to amend its emergency-use authorization for children aged 5 to 11 in September when it has more results. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned doctors and parents against vaccinating children under 12.</p><p>\"We really don't have any data\" on the safety and tolerability of the vaccine on 5- to 11-year-olds, says Sean O'Leary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and vice chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics'American Academy of Pediatrics' s committee on infectious diseases. Children under 5 are being studied, he says, with data coming later.</p><p>Dosages for 5- to 11-year-olds likely would be much smaller than what is available, he says. Higher dosages administered to those children could cause unexpected safety issues. \"We just don't have data and we need it,\" he says.</p><p>Pfizer is testing the vaccine in children under 12, down to children as young as 6 months old but expects results for 5- to 11-year-olds in September, with other ages later. Should results show that it is safe and effective, it plans to request full approval. Moderna also is testing its inoculation on children under 12 down to six months, and J&amp;J is testing its vaccine on children 12 to 17.</p><p>The CDC issued updated guidance on the Pfizer vaccine Monday, saying doctors can't offer the vaccine to patients under 12 as part of off-label use, and that any off-label use of the vaccine, such as providing boosters, isn't authorized.</p><p>Providers who offer off-label use of the vaccine might not have immunity from claims because such usage may not be covered under the public-health emergency legislation that shields providers from liability.</p><p>They might also not be reimbursed for the costs of administering off-label shots, and giving them might also affect a provider's ability to remain in the CDC's Covid-19 vaccination program. All Covid-19 shots in the U.S. have been purchased by the federal government, which allows only those enrolled in its program to administer them.</p><p>The highly contagious Delta variant is tearing through the U.S., driving up infections primarily in unvaccinated communities, as children head back to school. More children have become infected since the strain began circulating this summer. Available data suggest that coronavirus-associated hospitalization and death is uncommon in children, according to the AAP.</p><p>Health officials remain focused on trying to get more older children who are eligible for the vaccine to get shots. According to the AAP, 43% of all 16- and 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. For 12- to 15-year-olds, the figure is 33%.</p><p>Monday's decision changes the calculus for parents such as Kelly Berg. The 45-year-old stay-at-home Los Angeles mom has contemplated an early vaccine for her 11-year-old triplets. In Texas, where the family has a second home, \"you can bring your kid in to get vaccinated and they don't really ask questions.\" She says that she knows vaccine recipients there under 12 but that she doesn't want to teach her children that it is OK to lie.</p><p>Now, with the news of approval, \"if there is a way to get around it legally, I am so there,\" Ms. Berg says.</p><p>Other parents say they tried to request vaccines after Monday's authorization but haven't had any luck.</p><p>Melanie Stickle, a 35-year-old mother of two in Silver Spring, Md., says when she heard of the full approval she called her pediatrician's office to see if they would consider vaccinating her children, aged 5 and 7. \"They said they weren't recommending it and wouldn't be doing it.\"</p><p>Regardless of what pediatricians suggest, parents are likely to press the issue in the coming weeks, according to doctors.</p>",
