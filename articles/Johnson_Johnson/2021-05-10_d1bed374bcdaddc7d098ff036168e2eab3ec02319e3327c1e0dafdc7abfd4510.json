  "title": "World News:  Some Nations Shift on AstraZeneca Shot  ----  By Kim Mackrael",
  "text": "<p>   Several countries have changed their guidance in recent days on who should receive the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, as public-health officials continue to weigh the risk of the vaccine against the prevalence of Covid-19 cases. </p><p>   The AstraZeneca shot hasn't been cleared for use in the U.S., unlike Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. But in some wealthy countries where the supply of those vaccines has been more constrained, AstraZeneca doses have been offered to people as young as 30, showing the wide variation even among wealthy countries in vaccination campaigns. </p><p>   On Friday, the U.K.'s vaccines advisory body said the vaccine produced by AstraZeneca, which has raised concerns among health experts due its possible link to rare blood clots, should preferably not be given to people under 40. Previous guidance suggested the vaccine should preferably not be given to people under 30. </p><p>   In Canada last week, members of a national expert panel referred to the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as the preferred option after elected officials had earlier encouraged citizens to get the first vaccine available, which for some age groups was AstraZeneca's shot. </p><p>   Meanwhile, German officials on Thursday took the opposite tack, saying they would make the vaccine available to all adults after earlier limiting it to those 60 years and older, as it sought to speed up a vaccination campaign that had gotten off to a slow start. </p><p>   AstraZeneca has struggled to pull together the data required for an emergency-use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S., and on Friday people familiar with the matter said it could skip that step in favor of pursuing a more time-intensive application for a full-fledged license to sell the shot. U.S. government and public-health officials have said they have ample supplies of other vaccines that are already authorized for use. </p><p>   Health officials note that with the pandemic abating in certain countries, the calculations around the benefits of receiving a vaccine change. </p><p>   British officials said Friday that while the risks of suffering the blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine are minuscule, they now outweigh the risks of someone under 40 suffering a fatal Covid-19 case. The calculation of the overall safety of the vaccine itself hasn't altered, the U.K. medicines regulator said. </p><p>   They said unvaccinatedindividualsunder 40 should receive alternative vaccines, \"where available and only if this does not cause substantial delays in being vaccinated.\" </p><p>   Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist at the University of Ottawa, said it is reasonable for experts' advice to change as new evidence emerges, and officials should be open with the public about what they know and recommend. </p><p>   But he said officials can struggle to communicate both the risks and benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine, adding to confusion and potentially chipping away at public trust. </p><p>   He said confusing messaging has been displayed in Canada: Last month authorities in many parts of the country began allowing people in their 40s and early 50s to book appointments for AstraZeneca's vaccine. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has repeatedly said the best vaccine is the first one that is available, was among those who signed up. </p><p>   Yet on the day Mr. Trudeau received his shot, the expert panel, called the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, said it preferentially recommended the messenger RNA vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. It said AstraZeneca's vaccine should be offered to those 30 years and older who don't want to wait, and for whom the benefits outweigh the risks. </p><p>   Canada's chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, said she didn't see the advice from the government and the panel as different. \"Everyone is trying to provide the best information in order for everyone to make a decision,\" Dr. Tam said. </p><p>   The Canadian advisory panel has said the risk of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or blood clotting, was about one in 100,000. As of May 6, Canada had reported 11 cases of blood clots and three blood clot-related deaths. It had administered more than 2 million AstraZeneca shots as of May 1. </p><p>   Heather Badenoch, a 45-year-old Ottawa resident who spent three days trying to snag an AstraZeneca appointment at overbooked pharmacies, said she was glad to have some protection, especially because her husband and mother-in-law would both be considered high risk if they contracted Covid-19. </p><p>   \"Zero regrets and pleased to have the antibodies,\" Ms. Badenoch said last week. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jason Douglas and Max Colchester contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
