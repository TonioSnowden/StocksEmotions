  "title": "ForSight Robotics Grabs $55 Million for Cataract Surgeries; Startup aims to make cataract procedures more effective and scalable",
  "text": "<p>Robotic-assisted surgery can help surgeons perform complex procedures with more precision, flexibility and control than is possible with conventional techniques, according to the Mayo Clinic. Surgeons use robotics to assist with procedures including prostate, hip and knee surgeries.</p><p>Robotic-surgery forerunners include Intuitive Surgical Inc., which went public in 2000 and now has a market capitalization of about $75 billion, and Mako Surgical Corp., which went public in 2008 and was acquired in 2013 by medical-technology company Stryker Corp. for about $1.65 billion.</p><p>As robotic surgery spreads it will enable more consistency across procedures and lower costs as surgeries require less time in the operating room, proponents say.</p><p>\"Imagine your best day playing golf,\" said Rony Abovitz, who co-founded Mako in 2004 and is an adviser to ForSight. \"With a robot, every time you swing it's your best day.\"</p><p>ForSight's advisers also include Fred Moll, who co-founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995 and previously was chief executive of venture-backed surgical-robotics company Auris Health, which Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired in 2019.</p><p>Cataracts are a clouding of the eye's lens that occurs with aging. More than half of Americans age 80 and over have cataracts or have had surgery to get rid of them, according to the National Eye Institute.</p><p>In cataract procedures a surgeon uses a knife or laser to make tiny cuts near the edge of the cornea, employs small instruments to break up the lens and remove it, and then inserts a new lens, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Some 90% of patients have improved vision following cataract surgery, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>Robotic surgery hasn't been used in cataract procedures because of the technical challenge of operating on such delicate tissue, said Elizabeth Yeu, a cornea and cataract specialist with Virginia Eye Consultants, an ophthalmology private practice based in Norfolk, Va., who performs cataract surgeries. Complication rates of cataract procedures are very low, she said.</p><p>But patients also have high expectations for cataract surgeries, she added. Robotics could help ensure the new lens sits exactly where the surgeon wants, according to Dr. Yeu, also an assistant professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School and an adviser to ForSight.</p><p>ForSight says it is using advances in microsurgical robotics, computer visualization and machine learning to make robotic surgery for cataracts possible.</p><p>The company, which says its robotic technology is 10 times more accurate than a human hand, is first developing a semiautonomous system and is working on a fully autonomous one that would enable a surgical practice to have several surgeries ongoing at once, according to co-founder and Chief Business Officer Joseph Nathan.</p><p>The semiautonomous system, which ForSight aims to bring to market in 2025, has a \"no-fly zone\" to improve safety, according to Dr. Nathan. If the surgeon makes an accidental movement that would damage the eye, the robot won't follow that aberrant motion into the no-fly zone, he added.</p><p>The company seeks to make cataract surgery more scalable and enable greater access to the procedure, especially in countries with aging populations but few surgeons available to perform it, he said.</p><p>Cataracts are a leading cause of vision impairment globally, and the proportion of vision impairment attributable to cataracts is higher in low- and middle-income countries than in wealthy nations, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>Adani Group led this Series A round for ForSight alongside existing investors Eclipse Ventures and Mithril Capital. Several new investors, including Provenio Capital, Precision Capital, Ljungstrom family office and other private investors also participated.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
