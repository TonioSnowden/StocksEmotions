  "text": "<p>The researchers found that the Moderna vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization was 93%, compared with 88% for Pfizer -BioNTech's and 71% for J&amp;J's. The effectiveness of the Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines also seemed to stand up better over time than that of J&amp;J's.</p><p>\"These real-world data suggest that the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer -BIoNTech mRNA vaccine regiments provide more protection than does the one-dose Janssen viral vector vaccine regimen,\" the authors wrote, referring to the J&amp;J vaccine by its branded name. They added that although there are differences in vaccine effectiveness, all three of the vaccines provide substantial protection against hospitalization.</p><p>The Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines also produced higher post-vaccination antibody levels than the J&amp;J vaccine, the researchers said.</p>",
