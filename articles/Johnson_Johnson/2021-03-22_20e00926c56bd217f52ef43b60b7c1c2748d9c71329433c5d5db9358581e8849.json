  "text": "<p>AstraZeneca's US clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine developed with Oxford university has shown 79 per cent efficacy at preventing symptomatic disease and 100 per cent efficacy against severe or critical disease and hospitalisation.</p> <p>The results are similar to those from other Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, said Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford and co-designer of the vaccine. “They are all highly effective,” she told the Financial Times.</p> <p>A fifth of the participants in the AstraZeneca trial were over 65 and the jab showed 80 per cent efficacy in these older participants.</p> <p>The AstraZeneca vaccine is currently the subject of a safety row in Europe, where at least 16 countries have paused or limited its rollout after some recipients developed unusual blood clotting side-effects. </p> <p>Since the European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine in January, it has always said the benefits far outweigh the risks. Most nations have resumed its use but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ef3a623-f3a2-4e76-afbd-94a915b24ad5\">a few continue to wait for more data</a>. </p> <p>An EMA investigation last week found no link to blood clotting in general, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c83944d5-ad26-415f-bf34-1eba428beeb9\">left the door open</a> to the possibility of a link to a rare combination of side-effects that involves blood clots in the brain, a low platelet count and bleeding.</p> <p>The US trial found the vaccine was well tolerated, AstraZeneca said, and an independent data safety monitoring board identified no safety concerns related to the vaccine.</p> <p>In particular, the group reviewed blood clotting problems including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis — a blood clot in the brain — with the assistance of an independent neurologist. </p> <p>The monitoring board found no increased risk of clotting or events characterised by blood clots among the 21,583 participants receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. A specific search for CVST found no cases in this trial, though the condition is so rare that a much larger sample would probably be needed to find any.</p> <p>AstraZeneca's American trial involved 32,449 people — mainly in the US but including some in Peru and Chile — in whom 141 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 were recorded.</p> <p>Ann Falsey, professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and a principal investigator for the trial, said: “These findings reconfirm previous results observed in [earlier] trials across all adult populations but it's exciting to see similar efficacy results in people over 65 for the first time.”</p> <p>AstraZeneca is now preparing to submit the findings to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use approval. “FDA approval is going to take some weeks,” Gilbert said. </p> <p>Shares in the London-listed drugmaker gained 1.3 per cent in early trading.</p> <p>Oxford and AstraZeneca have promoted the product as a “vaccine for the world” — easy to store and transport and currently sold at cost. But it is also at the centre of a diplomatic row over supplies between the EU and the UK, with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/254fc733-1568-4ea7-9fdf-069285c7f9c1\">former threatening</a> to block exports of the jab.</p> <p>Vaccines made by BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson have shown varying degrees of efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 in trials, but they have all been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe disease and death.</p> <p>The efficacy levels against symptomatic Covid-19 reported by Pfizer and Moderna are somewhat higher than for AstraZeneca, but Gilbert said direct comparisons between clinical trials of different vaccines could be misleading because each was carried out under slightly different conditions. </p> <p>For instance a different mixture of Covid-19 variants was circulating in the US during the AstraZeneca trial, compared with the earlier Pfizer and Moderna trials.</p> <p>“If you look at effectiveness in the real world, the data coming out in the UK shows there is nothing to choose between the Pfizer vaccine and ours,” Gilbert said.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Clive Cookson in London and Donato Paolo Mancini in Rome 2021 'AstraZeneca US trial shows 79% efficacy against Covid' FT.com 22 March.
