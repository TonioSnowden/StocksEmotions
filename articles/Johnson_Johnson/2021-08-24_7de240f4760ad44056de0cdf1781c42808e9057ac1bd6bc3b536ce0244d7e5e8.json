  "title": "J&J Injury Claimants Open New Front Against Possible Talc Bankruptcy; More talc-injury claimants try to prohibit J&J from possibly sweeping personal-injury liabilities into chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J declined to comment. As of July, there were roughly 34,600 pending lawsuits against the company alleging personal injuries from talc, according to a securities filing. J&amp;J has said in settlement talks it is considering isolating its talc liabilities from the rest of its business and placing them in chapter 11 to resolve the talc litigation, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.</p><p>J&amp;J has previously said it hasn't made any decision regarding the talc lawsuits other than to defend the safety of its products in pending cases. The company in court papers has also disputed links between talc use and ovarian cancer and has denied that asbestos was present in Johnson's Baby Powder.</p><p>A Texas statute allows splitting corporate assets through so-called divisive or divisional mergers. They have been used by several businesses facing large numbers of asbestos claims to silo those liabilities in newly formed units that can be placed into chapter 11.</p><p>The Missouri claimants want an injunction against any such maneuver, arguing it would violate state laws against fraudulent transfers and allow J&amp;J to pay \"mere pennies on the dollar for the injuries it has caused.\"</p><p>Bankruptcy filings generally halt tort cases and discovery proceedings, creating a single forum for companies beset with large liabilities to negotiate a restructuring without the threat of jury trials. J&amp;J itself could receive the benefit of a bankruptcy litigation stay even if only an affiliate files for chapter 11 protection, according to legal experts.</p><p>\"All the while, the tens of thousands of women who unwittingly used J&amp;J's deadly product would continue to suffer, and in many cases die, with little hope of receiving real justice,\" the Missouri petition argued, while alleging that J&amp;J's liability for current and future talc claims exceeds $24.5 billion.</p><p>In February, J&amp;J said it set aside $3.9 billion in litigation expenses in 2020, primarily for reserves and settlements related to talc.</p><p>J&amp;J now faces scrutiny on multiple fronts over how it intends to handle talc liabilities. Tuesday's request to restrain J&amp;J follows a similar request made by injury claimants in the chapter 11 proceedings of another company, Imerys Talc America Inc., which mined and supplied talc for J&amp;J for decades.</p><p>Imerys filed for chapter 11 protection in 2019 and has proposed a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would resolve its share of liability on thousands of talc claims. Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. is hearing the Imerys claimants' request Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>J&amp;J last month agreed to a temporary standstill with claimants in the Imerys case. A U.S. congressional panel has also asked for documents and information from J&amp;J on any company plans to place a subsidiary into bankruptcy.</p><p>In court papers unsealed last week, J&amp;J argued that granting the claimants' request would amount to hijacking the company's corporate governance based on \"a perceived hypothetical harm.\"</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com and Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
