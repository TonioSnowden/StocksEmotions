  "text": "<p>Its arrival could also make a big difference in vaccination efforts hobbled by limited supplies, providing a new, large source of doses. And many health authorities might find it simpler to administer the J&amp;J vaccine, which can more easily be stored and involves just one shot, while the other vaccines require two.</p><p>\"The availability of the J&amp;J vaccine will be a terrific asset,\" said William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University who serves as a liaison to a federal vaccine advisory committee. \"That could help us get through the bottleneck that we're in at the present time.\"</p><p>In its late-stage trial of 44,325 adults aged 18 and older, the J&amp;J vaccine also appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated, the company said Friday, though some of the volunteers reported side effects like fever.</p><p>J&amp;J, one of the world's biggest health-care companies, said it would ask American regulators in early February to authorize use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could take action by the end of February.</p><p>If the shot gets a green light, J&amp;J, which has been making shots to be ready should testing pan out, will be able to quickly ship millions of doses, federal officials have said. The company has said it expects to produce more than one billion doses in total this year. Their addition could give a big lift to a mass vaccination campaign that has started slowly and faced limited supplies.</p><p>The J&amp;J shot would also be more convenient for people getting vaccinated, because they would need to take only one shot rather than the two required for the Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. that have been available since December.</p><p>\"It's a pandemic vaccine preventing death and hospitalization and severe disease in an acute situation,\" Paul Stoffels, J&amp;J's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.</p><p>One potentially troubling sign: The vaccine's efficacy rate varied among the regions in the study, at 72% in the U.S., 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa, J&amp;J's interim analysis found, which could indicate the vaccine didn't work as well against new virus variants.</p><p>J&amp;J is working on a potential modified vaccine to target the variant in South Africa, if one becomes necessary.</p><p>The J&amp;J results haven't yet undergone the vetting by outside experts that typically precede publication in a medical journal. J&amp;J said it would submit the data for publication in the coming weeks.</p><p>Shares in J&amp;J fell 3.6% in Friday trading.</p><p>The company's vaccine is the latest to employ a relatively new gene-based technology to generate the immune protection capable of beating back the new coronavirus.</p><p>It deploys the virus behind the common cold -- modified so that it doesn't replicate -- to deliver a gene from the coronavirus. Once injected, the gene instructs human cells to make a protein resembling the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. This, in turn, mobilizes a person's immune system to fight off the actual virus if exposed to it.</p><p>The design is similar to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca PLC, which has been cleared for use in the U.K. and just got a European Union nod. It is also similar to the design of one component of J&amp;J's Ebola vaccine.</p><p>J&amp;J's Covid-19 shot employs a different gene-based technology than the messenger RNA approach behind vaccines from Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots were more than 94% effective in late-stage testing. Their studies were largely conducted before the newer variants were known to be circulating widely.</p><p>Even though it may not be as effective as those vaccines, J&amp;J's vaccine performance would be strong enough to protect many people and help build the community immunity needed for post-pandemic life, according to health experts.</p><p>\"A vaccine that is easy to transport, a vaccine that you can give in one dose, is going to have a very significant public-health impact,\" Matt Hepburn, who leads Covid-19 vaccine efforts for the federal government, told reporters.</p><p>J&amp;J's vaccine has less stringent cold-storage requirements than the mRNA-based vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. The J&amp;J vaccine can be kept stable for two years at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit and for at least three months in standard refrigerator temperatures of 35 to 46 degrees.</p><p>This could make it a more practical option not just in the U.S. but also in lower-income countries that don't have the equipment needed to store the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at ultracold temperatures.</p><p>The U.S. government agreed last year to buy 100 million doses of J&amp;J's vaccine for $1 billion, or $10 a dose, and provided $456 million of additional funding for clinical trials and other vaccine development activities at J&amp;J.</p><p>J&amp;J is providing the vaccine globally on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic.</p><p>Among subjects who got the vaccine, protection against Covid-19 began as early as 14 days following the single dose, J&amp;J said. The J&amp;J study tracked moderate and severe cases of Covid-19, defined as testing positive for the virus and having certain symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, fever or respiratory failure.</p><p>When looking only at severe cases, J&amp;J said its vaccine was 85% effective across all regions studied, as of 28 days after vaccination.</p><p>There were no cases of a severe type of allergic reaction that has occurred in some people after they received other Covid-19 vaccines, J&amp;J said.</p>",
