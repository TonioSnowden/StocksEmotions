  "title": "Stocks Finish Lower Ahead of Fed Decision; The central bank is expected to approve another 0.75-percentage-point rise in interest rates",
  "text": "<p>The Fed's quest to tame inflation by rapidly lifting interest rates has bruised stocks for much of the year. The S&amp;P 500 is down 19% in 2022, while the Dow industrials have lost 10%.</p><p>In recent weeks, however, the major indexes have rebounded due in part to hopes that the Fed could begin easing its monetary tightening into the end of the year. The Dow closed out October with its best monthly performance since 1976. It rose 14% during the month, while the S&amp;P 500 ended 8% higher.</p><p>A tight labor-market reading Tuesday morning clouded the outlook. The major averages turned lower after the latest numbers on job openings came in higher than expected, stoking fears that the Fed will keep raising interest rates aggressively due to the hot labor market. U.S. job openings jumped to 10.7 million in September, the Labor Department reported.</p><p>\"These days, good news is bad news. We probably would prefer to see some slowdown in the economy in order for inflation to start to come down and for the Fed to be able to to slow down its actions and rhetoric,\" said Marco Pirondini, head of equities and portfolio manager at Amundi US.</p><p>The central bank is widely expected to announce another 0.75-percentage-point rate increase at the end of its two-day monetary-policy meeting. Some Fed officials have signaled they could consider a smaller half-point rate lift in December.</p><p>Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell following the meeting Wednesday could offer clues about whether the central bank will adjust its course on monetary policy.</p><p>\"This recent rally sets us up for a bit of a disappointment if we don't get language on a pivot. There's a good chance that we end up down on Powell's statements tomorrow,\" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi.</p><p>Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, eased slightly. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to 4.052% Tuesday from 4.074% Monday.</p><p>Investors also parsed the latest corporate earnings updates. Uber shares rose $3.18, or 12%, to $29.75 after the ride-sharing company reported that revenue climbed last quarter.</p><p>This earnings season has seen mixed results from America's largest corporations. Some sectors have fared better than feared amid the dual threats of rising interest rates and inflation. Several bellwether technology firms, however, reported disappointing results and are suffering under higher rates.</p><p>Overall, third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 are set to grow 3% from the year before, according to FactSet figures blending actual results and estimates for firms yet to report. With about 62% of index constituents having reported earnings as of Tuesday's close, 72% have posted results that beat analyst estimates, compared with the five-year average of 77%.</p><p>Analysts are marking down their estimates for fourth-quarter and 2023 profits as the business environment gets tougher. Consensus fourth-quarter earnings growth expectations fell from around 9% at the end of June to less than 1%, according to FactSet.</p><p>Recent stock-market gains are likely to be temporary as the lagging effect of global interest-rate rises and high inflation begins to bite early next year, said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.</p><p>\"We are in the phase where there is still hope that we can get through this mess, with all these very significant distortions, without too much painâ€”hope springs eternal,\" Mr. Redha said. \"The path to a recession can often look like a soft landing,\" he said, referencing a situation in which interest-rate increases slow the economy but avoid creating a recession.</p><p>Elsewhere, shares of Abiomed jumped $125.74, or 50%, to $377.82 after Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would buy the company.</p><p>Overseas, speculation swirled that China was considering relaxing its strict Covid-19 policies, which have crimped growth in the world's second-largest economy. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 5.2%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.6% and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3%.</p><p>\"I think you can't ignore rumors like this because it is such a big theme that the market has been worrying about for so long,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>Optimism for a loosening of restrictions and rising Chinese demand also boosted oil prices and energy stocks. Brent crude oil gained 2% to $94.65 a barrel. The energy sector led the S&amp;P 500, rising 1%.</p><p>In Europe, indexes were also broadly higher. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.6%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Hannah Miao at hannah.miao@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Finish Lower Ahead of Fed Decision</p>",
