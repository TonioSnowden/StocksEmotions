  "text": "<p>Suit for $230 Million</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has agreed to pay $230 million to the state of New York to resolve an opioids lawsuit as negotiations intensify with the company and three drug distributors to clinch a $26 billion settlement of thousands of other lawsuits blaming the pharmaceutical industry for the opioid crisis.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's New York deal removes it from a coming trial on Long Island but not from the rest of the cases it faces nationwide, including a continuing trial in California. The New York settlement includes an additional $33 million in attorney fees and costs, and calls for the drugmaker to no longer sell opioids nationwide, something Johnson &amp; Johnson said it already stopped doing.</p><p>The company said there continues to be progress on the nationwide deal and that it \"remains committed to providing certainty for involved parties and critical assistance for communities in need.\"</p><p>-- Sara Randazzo</p><p>---</p><p>MICHIGAN</p><p>Thousands Without</p><p>Power After Storm</p><p>Residents in the Detroit area were cleaning up Sunday after flooding in the area overloaded sewer systems, damaged homes and knocked out power for thousands.</p><p>Bags of trash lined neighborhood streets in suburban Grosse Pointe Farms as garbage trucks made special rounds to help pick up debris, including damaged furniture and bedding.

It has been the most contentious piece of budget negotiations among a divided legislature that is up against a Wednesday deadline to avoid a government shutdown.</p><p>The Democratic-controlled state House included several policing provisions in its overall public-safety budget bill this session in the hopes of building on a package the legislature approved last summer.</p><p>The 223-page bill draft includes provisions regulating the use of no-knock warrants, a police misconduct database to create an early warning system to keep bad officers off the streets, and the creation of an office of missing and murdered indigenous relatives as well as a task force for missing and murdered Black women.</p><p>Republicans who control the Senate resisted many of the Democrats' proposals, calling some \"anti-police.\" The GOP negotiations at times focused those pushing to abolish the police, as well as violent protests following Mr. Floyd's killing. The agreement includes $2 million for violent-crime enforcement teams, a Republican-backed provision.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p>",
