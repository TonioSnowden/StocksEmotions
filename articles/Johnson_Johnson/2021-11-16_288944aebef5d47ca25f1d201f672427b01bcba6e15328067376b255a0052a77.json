  "title": "Times Square's New Year's Eve Celebration Is Back for Fully Vaccinated; Revelers ages 5 and up must show proof of vaccination to watch the ball drop at midnight in New York City",
  "text": "<p>Those 5 years old or older must be fully vaccinated to ring in 2022 in Times Square, said Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance, which oversees the ball drop. He said this means two doses of the Moderna Inc. or Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE vaccine, or one dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot.</p><p>Children younger than 5 will have to be with an adult who is fully vaccinated. People who aren't vaccinated for medical reasons must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours of the event and have to wear a face mask, the city said.</p><p>Mr. de Blasio said the city is requiring vaccines this year, even though the event is outdoors, because of the large crowd size and the hours people would stand together that day.</p><p>\"You're talking about a lot of people, really close for long periods of time. It makes sense to protect everyone,\" said Mr. de Blasio.</p><p>Checkpoints will be set up at Times Square for revelers to show proof of vaccination and a photo ID. Mr. de Blasio said the announcement Tuesday gives people enough time to get fully vaccinated by Dec. 31.</p><p>The city's seven-day average of newly confirmed and probable Covid-19 cases stood at 1,034 on Monday, according to New York City data, up 26% from two weeks ago. The city said 80.3% of adults are fully vaccinated.</p><p>New York City rang in 2021with a subdued celebration, inviting just over 100 people to Times Square who were first responders, front-line workers or their family members, according to the Times Square Alliance. There are no plans to restrict the number of people in Times Square this year, a spokesman for the Times Square Alliance said.</p><p>New Year's Eve will also be Mr. de Blasio's last day as New York City mayor. Mayor-elect Eric Adams will be sworn in the next day.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Times Square's New Year's Eve Celebration Is Back for Fully Vaccinated</p>",
