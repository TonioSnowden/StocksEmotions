  "text": "<p>\n  Joy Curran, an executive assistant at Johnson &amp; Johnson living in North Brunswick, N.J., on her 1970 Plymouth AAR 'Cuda, as told to A.J. Baime. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Growing up in New Jersey, my father and my mother's brother had quite a few muscle cars, and by age 6, I was hooked. In particular, I gravitated to Chrysler muscle cars like the Dodge Challenger and the Plymouth Barracuda. I was able to save some money, and the first car I bought, when I was 16, was a 1970 Challenger. It was my dream car. </p><p>\n  But unfortunately because I had a part-time job and school, I was not able to pay for the upkeep. I had to sell it. </p><p>\n  Later in life, my husband, Mark, and I had our priorities. We had to get our son through high school and college. </p><p>\n  When he graduated and found a good job, I told Mark, \"I want to start looking for a car.\" I had waited 30 years. </p><p>\n  My goal was to find a 1970 Plymouth AAR 'Cuda. But never in my imagination did I believe we could actually find one. </p><p>\n  What is an AAR 'Cuda? In 1970, Chrysler wanted to enter the Plymouth Barracuda in the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am racing series. [This series was known for its \"pony car wars,\" pitting Mustangs, Camaros and other muscle cars against each other.] To qualify the car, Chrysler had to build a certain number of customer street versions. </p><p>\n  The company partnered with the racing team All American Racers (AAR) to build the AAR 'Cuda [the abbreviated version of Barracuda is the car's official name]. In 1970, 2,724 Plymouth AAR 'Cudas were built, packing powerful 340-cubic-inch \"six-barrel\" V-8 engines. </p><p>\n  For us, in 2017, finding one was going to be a process. We found a pink one -- the actual color is called moulin rouge. I loved the paint, but the deal did not work out. My husband said, \"If we ever find a pink AAR 'Cuda that's in good shape, you're going to be driving it.\" We found our lime green metallic AAR 'Cuda in 2017, and the pink one you see here (a different one than the earlier one we had seen), in 2019. Both have four-speed manual transmissions. </p><p>\n  Ever since, we have been taking our 'Cudas to car shows, local Cars &amp; Coffees and cruise nights. Mark had a front license plate made that says \"CUDA GIRL,\" and that has become my nickname. Some people, when they find out my nickname, say, \"I don't know. I just don't see you into cars.\" But I always have been. </p><p>\n  My daily driver is a Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack with a 485-horsepower V-8 engine. There is just something about being in a car that has a lot of power that has always brought a smile to my face. </p><p></p>",
