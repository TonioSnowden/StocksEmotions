  "title": "Biotech Stocks, Once Booming, Enter Bear Territory; The biotech stock index, which rose early in the pandemic on hopes for Covid-19 treatments, has fallen amid research failures, slowing M&A and rising interest rates",
  "text": "<p>Over the past year, however, the boom has turned into a biotech bear market. The SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF, an equal-weighted index of biotech stocks, fell 19.7% in the first quarter of this year, compared with a 5% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>From its peak in February 2021, the biotech index has lost nearly half of its value, compared with a 15.7% rise in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Among the biotechs that have lost much of their value are several like CureVac NV and Novavax Inc. whose stocks had soared on the promise of developing Covid-19 vaccines and drugs. Shares in Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc. fell by two-thirds last October, after the Covid-19 pill it was developing with Roche Holding AG failed during testing.</p><p>Since last year, the rise in consumer price inflation and expectations for higher interest rates have made investors less keen on risky companies such as biotechs that can go years burning through cash before they develop a promising drug or turn a profit, biotech investors and analysts say.</p><p>\"It is a shift in capital allocation from risky, very future-leaning things to less risky things,\" says Eli Casdin, founder and chief investment officer of life-sciences hedge fund Casdin Capital, which had stockholdings of $3.5 billion at the end of 2021. \"In a public market, investors shoot first and ask questions later.\"</p><p>More biotechs than ever before started trading on public markets through IPOs during the pandemic. In 2020, 90 companies raised $14.8 billion, surpassing the previous inflation-adjusted peak of $9 billion raised by 67 biotechs in 2000, according to data compiled by Biogen Inc. Chairman and former Cowen &amp; Co. Vice Chairman Stelios Papadopoulos. In 2021, 112 biotechs raised $16.5 billion, a record.</p><p>The surge in new public biotechs has meant that there are now more companies chasing a dwindling amount of capital and investors in the downturn, biotech investors and analysts say. It has also led to a greater number of companies pursuing the same disease areas or drug technologies, creating more competitive risks for biotechs that do succeed in developing new medicines. </p><p>Novavax's research-and-development lab in Gaithersburg, Md.

After its Covid-19 drug failed in a midstage trial, Atea's market value had fallen to $600.1 million through the end of March, down 91% from its high of $7.3 billion in February 2021. Atea declined to comment.</p><p>CureVac, a German biotech that went public in August 2020, said last year that its vaccine provided less than 50% protection against Covid-19, a subpar result in the eyes of many investors and scientists. The stock has fallen 85.6% from its high in December 2020, shedding $20.6 billion in market value through the first quarter of 2022. CureVac didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Novavax, a biotech whose Covid-19 vaccine has shown strong protection in clinical trials, has been hurt by multiple delays in getting the drug authorized, hurting its near-term sales prospects. Novavax shares declined 77% from their high in February 2021 to $73.65 at the end of the third quarter, erasing $17.1 billion in market value.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook on the biotechnology sector for 2022? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Novavax Chief Executive Stan Erck said in an email that despite market pressure on biotech companies, Novavax is making substantial progress and expects its momentum to accelerate as it continues to roll out its vaccine in the European Union, South Korea and other countries where it has been authorized.</p><p>The news hasn't been better for biotechs outside the hunt for Covid-19 treatments. The market value for BridgeBio Pharma Inc., which made its IPO in 2019, plunged late last year when it said its treatment for a rare heart condition failed in the first part of a late-stage study. The company's market value at the end of March was $1.5 billion, down 86% from its high of $9.2 billion in March 2021.</p><p>BridgeBio has said that it has access to $1.2 billion that will fund its operations into 2024. \"Focused execution is our top priority and we have several big catalysts over the next 18 months that we hope will allow us to continue to deliver on our mission to serve patients,\" said BridgeBio Chief Executive Neil Kumar.</p><p>So far, big pharmaceutical companies haven't come to the sector's rescue by splurging on big acquisitions to retool their product pipelines, a strong driver of biotech valuations historically.</p><p>Acquisitions by the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization reached a 10-year high of $224 billion in 2019, and fell by more than half to $98 billion in 2020 before plummeting to $37 billion in 2021, according to SVB Leerink.</p><p>Deals have slowed down partly because it has been easier for biotechs to raise money from IPOs or follow-on sales of new stock, said Bruce Booth, a partner at venture-capital firm Atlas Venture. Many large pharmaceutical companies were scared off from doing deals because of how expensive biotech had become, Dr. Booth said.</p><p>\"Most of us would say we anticipate more M&amp;A for the next three quarters of 2022, in part because those valuations have come back into what might be a more appealing range for the business development groups of large pharma companies,\" Dr. Booth said.</p><p>The 14 largest pharmaceutical companies by market cap, including Pfizer Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, face the loss of tens of billions of dollars in revenue over the next decade from patent expirations on branded drugs, and have a combined $650.5 billion in capacity to do deals this year, according to Ronny Gal, a Bernstein &amp; Co. analyst.</p><p>\"The big pharma companies all have big holes in their pipelines and are looking to fill them\" with acquisitions, said Mr. Gal. \"When pharma begins to pull the trigger, you should see the biotechs begin to turn\" upward again.</p><p>Write to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com</p><p>Biotech Stocks, Once Booming, Enter Bear Territory</p>",
