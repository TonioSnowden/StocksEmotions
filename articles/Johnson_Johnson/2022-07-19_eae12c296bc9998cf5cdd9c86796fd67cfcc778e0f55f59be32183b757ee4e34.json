  "text": "<p>The new guidance comes as the company reported higher sales in its second quarter on increased sales of its Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson logged $544 million in revenue tied to its Covid-19 vaccine, with international buyers accounting for most of those sales. U.S. vaccine sales declined about 11.5%. In the same period a year earlier, the company's Covid-19 vaccine sales were $164 million.</p><p>The shot is one of four vaccines for Covid-19authorized or approved in the U.S., with Novavax Inc.'s vaccine most recently winning authorization. But use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot in the U.S. has lagged behind that of vaccines developed by rival manufacturers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. U.S. health regulators briefly paused the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in April of last year as they investigated rare blood-clotting conditions.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for Johnson and Johnson's business? Join the conversation below.</p><p>About 17.1 million Americans have been vaccinated with Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose shot, a fraction of the number who have been immunized with shots made by Moderna and by Pfizer and BioNTech SE, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those companies' booster shots have also seen far more use in the U.S. than Johnson &amp; Johnson's.</p><p>Overall, Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceuticals business propelled companywide sales 3% higher in the second quarter, while the medical-devices and consumer businesses saw sales fall from a year earlier.</p><p>In the second quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson posted overall sales of $24 billion, compared with $23.3 billion a year earlier. Currency adjustments lowered sales growth by 5%, the company said. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting quarterly sales of $23.77 billion.</p><p>Profit was $4.81 billion, or $1.80 a share, down from $6.28 billion, or $2.35 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time costs, Johnson &amp; Johnson's per-share profit was $2.59. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting an adjusted profit of $2.54, according to FactSet.</p><p>Pharmaceutical sales rose 6.7% to $13.32 billion, helped by sales of the company's Covid-19 vaccine, as well as other products, including Stelara, a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The segment's adjusted operational sales, which exclude the impact of divestitures and translational currency, grew 12.4%.</p><p>In the consumer business, sales declined 1.3% to $3.81 billion. The segment's adjusted operational sales rose 2.9%, boosted by sales of Imodium and Neutrogena products.</p><p>Sales from Johnson &amp; Johnson's medical-device unit fell 1.1% to $6.9 billion, but adjusted operational sales rose 3.4%.</p><p>The results come as the company prepares to separate its consumer-health division into a stand-alone business, leaving Johnson &amp; Johnson with its prescription-drug and medical-device units. That split will likely come in 2023, Johnson &amp; Johnson has said.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Trims Full-Year Guidance on Stronger Dollar</p>",
