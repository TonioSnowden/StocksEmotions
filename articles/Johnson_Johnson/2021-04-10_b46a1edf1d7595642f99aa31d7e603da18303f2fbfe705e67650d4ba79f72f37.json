  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Soured Deal Triggers Newspaper Battle  ---  Alden Global, a New York hedge fund, was about to add Tribune Publishing to its empire -- until Stewart Bainum got angry  ----  By Lukas I. Alpert",
  "text": "<p>   A few weeks ago, New York hedge fund Alden Global Capital LLC was on the verge of acquiring Tribune Publishing Co. -- home to the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and other U.S. metro newspapers -- with seemingly no one in its way. </p><p>   Then it offended one of its partners in the deal, setting off a battle that could help shape the future of local news in America. </p><p>   Maryland hotel magnate Stewart Bainum Jr. had worked out a side arrangement with Alden Chief Executive Heath Freeman to buy the Sun, a paper Mr. Bainum grew up reading. Then, in Mr. Bainum's view, Alden tried to raise the cost of a fee agreement that would substantially jack up the price, people close to the situation said. </p><p>   Mr. Bainum told his advisers late on the afternoon of Friday, March 12, that he was worried he could no longer trust Alden, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   That evening, the 74-year-old got on the phone with his bankers and decided to attempt a stunning 11th-hour move: his own bid for the whole company, which he announced by the end of the weekend. </p><p>   \"No one is going to squeeze Stewart Bainum,\" said Stephen Joyce, who was chief executive of Mr. Bainum's company, Choice Hotels International Inc., for nearly a decade until 2017. \"When he makes a deal, he sticks to it. Anyone who tries to change the terms is messing with the wrong guy.\" </p><p>   In a matter of weeks, Mr. Bainum orchestrated a $680 million bid, at least for now besting the $635 million offered by Alden. He pledged $100 million of his own money and quickly enlisted the backing of 85-year-old Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, who has offered to provide the rest, according to filings and people familiar with the agreement. </p><p>   The battle for Tribune is the culmination of a larger fight over the future of local news, a long-beleaguered industry that was further hammered by the pandemic. Alden has become known for a strategy of consolidation and aggressive cost-cutting that stanches losses but that critics say is gutting local outlets and hastening the industry's demise. </p><p>   Mr. Bainum and his allies represent an alternative: One that relies on the goodwill of ultrawealthy benefactors. </p><p>   If successful, Messrs. Bainum and Wyss plan to break up Tribune -- with Mr. Bainum keeping the Sun and Mr. Wyss, who lives in Wyoming, taking control of the Chicago Tribune. They intend to sell the rest piecemeal, and have attracted interest from deep-pocketed investors for some of the chain's seven other papers in Florida, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. </p><p>   \"American newspapers are at a fork in the road between two fundamentally different ownership models,\" said Jim Friedlich, executive director of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, the nonprofit foundation that owns the Philadelphia Inquirer, and an unpaid adviser to Mr. Bainum. \"Whether the decline of this once-towering American newspaper chain accelerates rapidly or is meaningfully reversed will be determined in the next few weeks.\" </p><p>   Messrs. Bainum and Wyss declined to be interviewed for this article. An Alden spokesman responded to written questions by saying their characterization of events was inaccurate, but didn't offer specifics or comment further. </p><p>   In an interview last year, Alden's Mr. Freeman, 41, said he has never closed a paper, although he has merged titles to cut costs. He declined to discuss operating details, but said the papers Alden owns -- many of which were bought out of bankruptcy -- had to be overhauled after years of poor management left them laden with debt and unrealistic cost structures. </p><p>   \"These papers were left for dead by a lot of the people that reporters think are the saviors of this business,\" Mr. Freeman said. </p><p>   Alden, whose takeover offer had already been accepted by a special committee of the Tribune board, has an opportunity to counter Mr. Bainum's bid, and could still prevail. Tribune earlier this week said it is likely to consider Mr. Bainum's bid superior if he stands by it after reviewing the company's books. If that happens, Alden would then have to raise its bid or walk away with a $20 million breakup fee. </p><p>   The direction of the Tribune deal may also ultimately rely on the company's second-largest shareholder, biotech billionaire and Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, who owns about 25% of Tribune. Mr. Soon-Shiong said this week in an email he hasn't yet made up his mind how to vote. </p><p>   People close to Mr. Bainum say that if the deal is successful, he intends to invest in the Sun until it is able to stand on its own feet. He would then give the paper -- which is currently profitable -- to a nonprofit foundation that he would endow with a substantial donation, a plan similar to what fellow billionaires did with newspapers in Philadelphia and Salt Lake City in recent years, the people said. </p><p>   Mr. Wyss has said he intends to invest in the Chicago Tribune but is also considering a similar nonprofit model for the news organization, according to people familiar with the agreement between Messrs. Bainum and Wyss. </p><p>   Mr. Bainum's effort has been cheered on by Tribune journalists across the country, who, out of fear for their jobs, had launched campaigns in several markets to find wealthy philanthropists to buy their papers and prevent a sale to Alden. </p><p>   Mr. Wyss, who founded a medical-device maker later bought by Johnson &amp; Johnson, came forward after reading one such plea by reporters at the Chicago Tribune. After he was connected with Mr. Bainum, the two reached an agreement in principle to join forces in less than 24 hours, said a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Neither Mr. Bainum nor Mr. Wyss has any previous experience running newspapers, and other billionaires have a mixed record venturing into the business. The Washington Post experienced strong subscriber growth after being acquired by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos in 2013, and the Boston Globe and Minneapolis Star-Tribune have both maintained sizable staffs under billionaire ownership. Warren Buffett, a lifelong newspaper lover, gave up on the business entirely last year, with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. selling its 31 newspapers to Lee Enterprises for $140 million. </p><p>   Alden's approach to newspapers is to dramatically expand profit margins through cost-cutting, combining services, outsourcing and selling off real estate. Its newspaper company, closely held MediaNews Group, which publishes some 70 daily papers including the Denver Post and San Jose Mercury News, had a profit margin of 17% in 2017, according to a person familiar with the matter. By contrast, the New York Times Co.'s margin was under 1% that year, while Gannett Co. came in at 1.7%, according to public filings. Alden has declined to disclose more-recent numbers. </p><p>   Between 2012 and January of this year, MediaNews Group cut staff by 76% at its 11 unionized papers, including the Denver Post, the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the San Jose Mercury News, according to the News Guild, a union that represents newspaper employees. At the Norristown Times-Herald in Pennsylvania, staff was reduced to just five from 45. </p><p>   Terry Orme, the former publisher of the Salt Lake Tribune, which Alden owned until 2016, likened the strategy to what mining companies do when a mine nears the end of its productive life. </p><p>   \"When a mine is tapped out, they'll start pulling out the pillars of coal they left behind to hold the roof up. They'll get that last bit of coal out, but then the roof collapses,\" he said last year. </p><p>   Another former editor said Alden has done little to invest in transforming its fading newspapers into digital businesses. Neil Chase, who was the executive editor of Alden's San Jose Mercury News and East Bay Times until 2018, said he once provided a presentation to MediaNews Group's chief operating officer explaining methods to boost digital subscribers, but when the meeting ended, the executive left the report lying on the table. </p><p>   Dean Singleton, who founded MediaNews Group in 1983 and stepped aside in 2013 after Alden took control in a bankruptcy, said the hedge fund's cost-cutting isn't much different than what is going on across the media industry. </p><p>   Other media companies \"are basically doing the same thing, just not as quickly,\" he said in an interview last year. \"It's easy to make Alden out to be the bogeyman, but they didn't create the problems in the newspaper industry. They just see them as opportunities.\" </p><p>   People close to Mr. Bainum, the Maryland hotel magnate, said he had grown saddened in recent years with the state of the Tribune-owned Baltimore Sun, which he frequently picks up at the end of his Chevy Chase, Md., driveway. </p><p>   Mr. Bainum chairs Choice Hotels, which operates brands like Econo Lodge, Quality and Comfort Inn, an empire that was founded by his father. Shares in the company controlled by Mr. Bainum and his family are valued at more than $2.1 billion, according to FactSet, a market-data research firm. </p><p>   A former politician who served for eight years as a Democrat in the Maryland state legislature in the 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Bainum is known to take copious notes during business conversations on yellow pads and takes a journalistic approach to asking questions, according to people who know him. He has told people he has newspapers in his blood, as his grandfather carried the family through the depression working as a street vendor for the Detroit Free Press after being laid off from a Ford Motor plant. </p><p>   Last summer, Mr. Bainum began exploring the possibility of acquiring the Baltimore Sun. </p><p>   \"This is not something he views purely as a business deal,\" said Mr. Joyce, the former Choice Hotels CEO. He said that if history is any guide, Mr. Bainum would hire high-level professionals and trust them to find innovative ways to run the Sun and not seek to interfere. </p><p>   While Mr. Bainum was pondering a bid for the Sun, Alden had been solidifying its position in Tribune. The fund had amassed a 32% stake in the company starting in late 2019 with the intention of ultimately taking it over and merging it with MediaNews, its newspaper company. </p><p></p>",
