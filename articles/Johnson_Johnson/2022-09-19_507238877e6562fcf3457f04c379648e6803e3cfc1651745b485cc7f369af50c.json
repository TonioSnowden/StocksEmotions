  "title": "Judges Probe J&J Talc Bankruptcy in High-Stakes Appeal; A federal appeals court is reviewing injury claimants request to invalidate Johnson & Johnson's strategy for moving the litigation to chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>The consumer health giant used a Texas law to create a new subsidiary with minimal business operations, called LTL Management LLC, which carried 38,000 pending lawsuits to bankruptcy. Talc claimants argued Monday that J&amp;J's strategy inverts how Congress meant for bankruptcy to work, by allowing a company to hive off liabilities into new subsidiaries like LTL that are created solely to access chapter 11.</p><p>LTL's lawyer argued that its chapter 11 filing was permissible and in the best interests of injury claimants. Third Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, a noted bankruptcy jurist, questioned whether talc claimants are better off in bankruptcy court than they were before LTL filed chapter 11.</p><p>\"If you are a claimant it would seemâ€¦this bankruptcy is about as good as you can get absent getting [punitive damages],\" Judge Ambro said.</p><p>J&amp;J's strategy has divided bankruptcy specialists and could be used more widely by other corporations facing personal-injury litigation.</p><p>A talc injury lawyer denied Judge Ambro's assertion, saying LTL's chapter 11 case has put an indefinite hold on J&amp;J's potential settlement of individual cases, effectively delaying recoveries for people dying of cancer.</p><p>Throughout the hearing, talc injury lawyers told the appeals panel that the biggest beneficiary of LTL's chapter 11 case are J&amp;J shareholders.</p><p>Jeffrey Lamken, a lawyer representing a committee of talc claimants, said dividends and other payments to J&amp;J shareholders would have been put on hold had the company put its entire consumer health business into chapter 11, rather than creating LTL.</p><p>Mr. Lamken said the LTL filing effectively bypasses chapter 11 rules that require company creditors get repaid first before equity holders. Mr. Lamken noted Monday's hearing was happening days after J&amp;J announced a $5 billion share repurchase program.</p><p>\"But talc victims alone are mired in bankruptcy as they die,\" Mr. Lamken said.</p><p>LTL filed bankruptcy last October, just two days after it was created, a fact injury claimants have said shows J&amp;J's strategy was meant to get a litigation advantage. J&amp;J created LTL months after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a $2.1 billion judgment for 20 women who alleged talc-based baby powder caused their ovarian cancer, which the company has denied.</p><p>On Monday, the appeals panel questioned if the timing of LTL's filing supports claimants' allegation that chapter 11 is being used to gain an unfair edge and undermines J&amp;J's claim that the bankruptcy filing is in claimants' interest.</p><p>LTL lawyer Neal Katyal said any potential advantage is a byproduct of a chapter 11 case that was meant to equitably compensate injury claimants more quickly than they would likely be outside bankruptcy in the civil jury system.</p><p>Mr. Katyal, a former acting solicitor general, said the litigation costs $2 million to $5 million to defend each individual talc case. Those expenses are a \"huge deadweight loss\" that could instead be used to compensate talc claimants, Mr. Katyal said.</p><p>Chapter 11 also includes rules that protect claimants interests, with any potential settlement requiring their overwhelming support and protects the interests of unknown plaintiffs who could get sick in the future, Mr. Katyal said..</p><p>Mr. Katyal said many of the arguments raised by talc claimants are premature and cited a \"daunting\" standard for ordering a February ruling upholding J&amp;J's strategy.</p><p>LTL and J&amp;J are incentivised in the bankruptcy court and by guidance from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is overseeing LTL's chapter 11, to negotiate with claimants with the aim of striking an equitable deal, Mr. Katyal said.</p><p>\"We are highly incentivized to put a good plan together because otherwise we get returned to the mass tort system with all the uncertainty and all of the problems [inherent] to it,\" Mr. Katyal said.</p><p>The Third Circuit panel didn't rule Monday and said it would take the arguments under advisement.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
