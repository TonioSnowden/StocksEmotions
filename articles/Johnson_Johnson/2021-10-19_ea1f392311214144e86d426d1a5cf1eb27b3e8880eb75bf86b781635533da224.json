  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson spent $1.4bn on a contentious legal manoeuvre that created a subsidiary to manage multibillion-dollar claims relating to its talc and placed it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company's chief financial officer Joseph Wolk said on Tuesday.</p> <p>The world's biggest health products company has faced tens of thousands of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c82423d4-6728-4292-9653-44b87ebd7a94\">lawsuits</a> from plaintiffs alleging that its cosmetic talc product causes cancer. Critics' argue that the legal move is aimed at limiting future payouts.</p> <p>Defending the manoeuvre, which has become known as the “Texas two-step”, Wolk reiterated that the company rejects claims its product is carcinogenic.</p> <p>“While we believe the cases lack merit . . . What we've done is acknowledged that there's an established process that allows companies facing, you know, abusive tort systems to resolve claims in an efficient and equitable manner,” he said.</p> <p>Carl Tobias, professor of law at University of Richmond, noted that there was little legal precedent for J&amp;J's “Texas two-step” manoeuvre. “I think the 35,000 plaintiffs and their lawyers are likely to challenge this in the bankruptcy court,” he said.</p> <p>The disclosure came as J&amp;J increased its 2021 profit forecast following strong third-quarter earnings growth driven by a broad recovery across its main healthcare divisions, as Covid-19 restrictions ease worldwide.</p> <p>The company, which sold $502m of its Covid-19 vaccine during the quarter, said sales of the jab are on track to reach $2.5bn in 2021, despite facing manufacturing challenges that had led to delays.</p> <p>The company said it was gearing up to apply to US regulators for full approval for its vaccine ahead of a shift away from not-for-profit sales pricing to more commercial pricing.</p> <p>J&amp;J added that double-digit growth in sales of its cancer medication Darzalex and several other treatments had helped push third-quarter adjusted earnings per share to $2.60 beyond analysts' consensus estimates of $2.36.</p> <p>“Our third-quarter results demonstrate solid performance across Johnson &amp; Johnson, driven by robust above-market results in pharmaceuticals, ongoing recovery in medical devices, and strong growth in Consumer Health,” said Alex Gorsky, chair and chief executive.</p> <p>Shares in J&amp;J jumped about 3 per cent to $165 following the company's updated guidance.</p> <p>The upbeat forecasts come at a turbulent time for J&amp;J, which is also undergoing a leadership transition with Gorsky due to step down as chief executive in January to become executive chair. He will be replaced by Joaquin Duato, vice-chair of J&amp;J's executive committee.</p> <p>J&amp;J disclosed net legal expenses rose to $1.9bn in the third quarter 2021, up from $1.2bn in the same period a year earlier.</p> <p>The company expects annual earnings to be between $9.77 and $9.82 per share, up from a previous estimate of $9.60 to $9.70 per share, when adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>Source: Jamie Smyth in Boston 2021 'J&amp;J spent $1.4bn on legal move to shield it from talc cancer claims' FT.com 19 October.
