  "text": "<p>   Top health officials warned that vaccine hesitancy posed a risk to getting enough Americans inoculated to stop the spread of Covid-19, and they encouraged individuals to get vaccinated. </p><p>   \"If we're going to be able to put Covid-19 behind us, we need to have all Americans take part in getting us to that point,\" Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday on NBC. </p><p>   President Biden's chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, said the U.S. has made good progress on vaccinations overall but the level of infections remains precarious at an average of nearly 60,000 daily cases in the past week as of Friday. \"We don't want that to go up,\" Dr. Fauci said on ABC. </p><p>   Dr. Collins highlighted pockets of the country that are falling behind on vaccinations. \"You can look at the map and say, 'Where are vaccines lagging?' Those are the places to worry about,\" he said. </p><p>   Both officials offered assurances on the safety of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 shot. U.S. health regulators on Friday said vaccinations with J&amp;J's shot should resume, after they temporarily paused use of the shots while investigating rare blood-clotting cases. </p><p>   The U.S. weekly average of vaccine doses administered, which has been generally rising since mid-December, ticked downward last week. The number of people receiving their first dose fell from a seven-day-average of 1.9 million April 11 to 1.4 million April 17. </p><p>   Estimates have differed on how much of the population would need to be vaccinated to stop the virus from circulating, but many health experts are using 70% to 80% as a goal. As of Thursday, 52% of adults in the U.S. had gotten at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>   Dr. Fauci also said Sunday that he expects the CDC will soon issue updated guidelines on wearing masks outside. </p><p></p>",
