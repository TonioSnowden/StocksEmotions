  "title": "Second Boosters Approved For Older Adults",
  "text": "<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed up by endorsing the second booster shots of those mRNA vaccines.</p><p>The extra doses are \"especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from Covid-19, as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time,\" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said.</p><p>Under the moves, the older adults can get the shots at least four months after a first booster dose. People will be able to choose between the two vaccines regardless of whether they earlier received a shot from Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>The thumbs-up for the extra doses comes as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to fall but public-health experts express concerns about future surges. One subvariant of the Omicron strain has become the predominant force behind rising cases in parts of the U.S. and has boosted case counts in other parts of the world.</p><p>The FDA on Tuesday also cleared a second Pfizer-BioNTech booster dose for people 12 and older with weakened immune systems and who have received a first booster dose of any authorized Covid-19 vaccine. And the FDA also authorized a second Moderna booster for immunocompromised people 18 and older.</p><p>The CDC also recommended the second shots for the immunocompromised groups. That agency also said people who previously got two doses of J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine -- a primary single-dose shot followed by a booster -- at least four months ago may now receive a second booster dose.</p><p>The extra doses will be available at physician offices, retail pharmacies, nursing homes and other vaccination sites. The federal government has said it expects to have enough available supplies.</p><p>\"Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from Covid-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals,\" said Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's vaccines division. A second booster \"could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals,\" he said.</p><p>Still, health authorities likely face an uphill battle in another vaccine campaign. About two-thirds of adults over 65 so far have received a booster, and less than half of the adult population has.</p><p>Some 23% of people who received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose said they definitely won't get a booster, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, while 24% said they would only if they were required to do so. The rest said they would get one or would wait and see if they would get one.</p><p>The federal government has been providing vaccines free of charge in the U.S. under a program through which Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurers pay doctors, pharmacies and other vaccination sites for the shots. The uninsured could face fees for getting a shot, however, because a separate program covering the cost is winding down due to a lack of funding.</p><p>The CDC already recommends four mRNA vaccine doses for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as transplant recipients and HIV patients. For those people, the extra dose is considered a booster shot after a three-dose primary series.</p><p>More than 96 million people in the U.S. have received initial booster doses since they were first authorized for adults in November and then for adolescents since January. The U.K., France, Germany and other countries have begun giving second booster doses to certain adults.</p><p>Boosters can bolster immune defenses against the coronavirus that fade over time, according to many health officials and vaccine experts. Researchers are divided, however, on the need to give a second booster, and when and who should be first to receive them.</p><p>Research has shown that protection from shots falls after several months. Studies also have shown that an additional dose can boost immune systems that have weakened months after initial vaccination, and is more likely to neutralize the Omicron variant than two doses.</p><p>Yet there are limited and somewhat mixed data showing how well a fourth dose works.</p><p>Researchers who studied the efficacy of fourth doses of mRNA vaccines in healthcare workers wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that the additional dose \"may have only marginal benefits,\" although they didn't study older and vulnerable people.</p><p>In seeking authorization, Pfizer cited two real-world studies from Israel that showed a second booster dose increased people's antibody levels and lowered the rates of infections and severe disease. Moderna said its request was based on recently published data from Israel and the U.S.</p><p>As part of a clinical trial looking at a vaccine tailored to target Omicron, Pfizer is evaluating how much protection a fourth dose of its current vaccine might provide. Pfizer has said it expects results during the first half of this year.</p><p>Moderna is testing fourth doses of its original vaccine in a mid-stage clinical trial, as well as booster shots that specifically target Omicron.</p><p>Given the limited data, the CDC didn't issue a strong recommendation urging those eligible to get a second booster. Rather, the agency simply advised that people who want to get a booster can go ahead.</p><p>The FDA authorized boosters for older adults because a third of people 50 to 65 have significant medical conditions that raise their risk of serious outcomes from Covid-19, Dr. Marks said.</p><p>\"We felt we'd capture the population that would most benefit,\" he said.</p><p>---</p><p>Betsy McKay and Peter Loftus contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
