  "text": "<p>   Manufacturers, already racing to keep up with demand, confronted shortages of critical raw materials like vials. </p><p>   A 200 million-dose agreement Covax struck for vaccines from Sanofi SA didn't come through after test subjects were accidentally given wrong doses in clinical trials. A 1.1 billion-shot deal with Novavax Inc. stumbled when the company had to repeatedly delay clinical trials. A nonbinding deal made in December with Johnson &amp; Johnson to supply 500 million doses through 2022 only recently led to a purchase of 200 million doses, which the company will try to deliver this year. </p><p>   Chinese vaccine makers Sinopharm and Sinovac weren't offering clear answers on prices, delivery schedules or volumes, a person familiar with their discussions said. The companies were slow to provide the WHO with adequate data such as manufacturing details or the shots' efficacy rate across age groups. Sinopharm and Sinovac didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Instead of donating through Covax, Beijing began simply loading its vaccines into planes bound for foreign airports. </p><p>   On Feb. 15, the WHO approved the AstraZeneca shot for emergency use, six weeks after it was cleared in the U.K. That allowed Covax to make its first shipment to a developing country, Ghana, weeks after Serum began exporting shots to other countries. </p><p>   Three days later, the U.S., now under President Biden, announced a $2 billion contribution to Covax, with another $2 billion planned through 2022. The EU upped its commitment. </p><p>   By then, there were scant vaccines available to buy. This month, Covax reached a deal with Moderna for 500 million doses, of which 466 million won't be delivered until 2022. </p><p>   Covax officials are pleading with wealthy countries awash in doses to share their stocks. They are also helping companies set up new plants and break supply-chain bottlenecks. </p><p>   The Biden administration plans to send 80 million doses overseas next month, including some to Covax. The EU says it will donate 100 million. That won't be enough. </p><p>   \"Maybe some of us had too much hope in Covax,\" said Francis Dien Mwansa, a health-ministry official organizing the vaccine rollout in Zambia, where 0.7% of the population has received a first shot. </p><p></p>",
