  "title": "Booster Shots Likely After Six Months",
  "text": "<p>The Biden administration and companies have said there should be enough supply for boosters that they plan to begin distributing more widely on Sept. 20. The U.S. has purchased a combined one billion doses from Pfizer and Moderna Inc . A White House spokesman declined to comment. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on interactions with vaccine makers.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday they had asked U.S. health regulators to authorize boosters of their Covid-19 vaccine, and submitted additional data showing a third dose improves protection. The FDA granted full approval to the vaccine on Monday. Biden administration officials have said they hope full approval would encourage more people to get vaccinated, pushing up inoculation rates that recently climbed past 60% of the eligible U.S. population.</p><p>Pfizer said it couldn't comment on potential regulatory decisions. Moderna said Wednesday that it had completed filing for full approval of its vaccine, which uses similar mRNA technology as the Pfizer -BioNTech shot. Full approval of Moderna's vaccine is expected in about three months, said the person familiar with the matter. Johnson &amp; Johnson has said it plans to file for approval later this year.</p><p>Federal officials last week recommended that adults who got a two-dose regimen of mRNA shots begin getting boosters in September. Officials said at the time the shots would be administered about eight months after the second dose for people ages 18 and older.</p><p>\"We continue to plan for boosters starting at 8 months after individuals' second shot, as our top doctors and public health leaders announced last week,\" the department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday in a statement.</p><p>The effort hinges on FDA clearance of the additional shots, and a recommendation by a vaccine-advisory committee of outside experts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The CDC sets recommendations on who gets priority for the vaccines and when.</p><p>Health authorities already have authorized booster shots for people ages 12 and older whose immune systems are compromised. People 65 and older and individuals in chronic-care facilities are expected to get boosters first, along with health workers and anyone else who was vaccinated earliest, according to federal health officials.</p><p>Some public-health experts have said boosters aren't necessary based on data that shows ongoing protection against hospitalizations and death from the initial round of shots. Vin Gupta, health adviser to the Biden administration's postelection transition team, said he believes boosters should be reserved for people with compromised immune systems, older people and people with comorbidities such as diabetes. \"I don't think there's any compelling data for boosters for everyone at eight months,\" Dr. Gupta said.</p><p>Leana Wen , health-policy professor at George Washington University, said approving boosters starting at six months after a previous dose makes sense based on available data on waning immunity. \"That doesn't mean every patient needs to get a booster at six months,\" she said.</p><p>Studies indicate the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine is still highly effective in people six months after their second dose. Yet, there is some evidence its efficacy might diminish over longer periods, and the shot isn't as effective against the contagious Delta variant, prompting research into adding a third dose.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday that the third dose generated a stronger immune system against the original Covid-19 strain compared with the initial two-dose course.</p><p>The submission includes data from a late-stage trial of 306 subjects between 18 and 55 years who got a third dose between 4.8 and eight months after completing the two-dose course of inoculation, Pfizer said. Neutralizing antibodies -- which play a key role in the immune system -- were more than three times as much when measured one month after the third dose, compared with one month after the second dose.</p><p>The administration of a third dose also appeared safe in the trial, the companies said. They didn't say whether the data included how well a booster shot worked against the highly contagious Delta variant.</p>",
