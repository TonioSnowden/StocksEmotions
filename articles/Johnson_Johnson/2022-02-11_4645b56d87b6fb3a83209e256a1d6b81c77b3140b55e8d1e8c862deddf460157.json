  "title": "Even Among the Vaccinated, Covid-19 Prompted a Surge of Sick Days; At the start of 2022, Omicron hot spots in the U.S. were especially hard-hit with employee absences",
  "text": "<p>While vaccines were harder to come by early last year, the Omicron variant's resistance to vaccines helped drive infections among workers, which had been more limited to the unvaccinated for much of 2021.</p><p>About 87% of adults who did any work at the beginning of the year were vaccinated, according to the Census survey. About 6.6 million vaccinated workers and 2.1 million unvaccinated ones were out sick at the beginning of the year.</p><p>So who were the most likely to get sick and miss work?</p><p>About 3% of workers who reported being vaccinated with a two-dose vaccine said they had been out sick or caring for someone who was. By contrast, 5.7% of unvaccinated workers missed work for similar reasons.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How did your company fare with the January surge in sickout rates? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Meanwhile, workers who received the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine—the smallest group among those vaccinated—were the most likely to have worked outside the home.</p><p>The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is the only single-dose vaccine approved in the U.S.</p><p>Higher-income workers were more likely to have had three or more shots of a Covid vaccine.</p><p>The Northeast accounted for some of the highest statewide boosted rates. More than 53% of adults in Vermont reported receiving at least three doses. Washington, D.C., has a 40-percentage-point discrepancy in boosted rates between those making less than $50,000 a year and those making more.</p><p>Conversely more than 1 in 4 in each of Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming are unvaccinated—with high-wage earners in each state more likely to be vaccinated than lower-wage workers.</p><p>The surge in sick workers hit Maryland, New York and Texas especially hard at the beginning of the year, with more than 1 in 20 workers in each state unable to work because they were sick with or caring for someone with Covid.</p><p>D.C. and Alabama saw rates below 1% of parents missing work due to Covid school closures. D.C. had low rates of people out sick with the virus, but workers there were more likely to have missed work for economic reasons, with more than 4 percent of respondents saying they had been laid off or their place of work was closed due to the pandemic.</p><p>Andrew Barnett contributed additional graphics to this article.</p><p>Write to Danny Dougherty at Danny.Dougherty@wsj.com</p><p>Even Among the Vaccinated, Covid-19 Prompted a Surge of Sick Days</p>",
