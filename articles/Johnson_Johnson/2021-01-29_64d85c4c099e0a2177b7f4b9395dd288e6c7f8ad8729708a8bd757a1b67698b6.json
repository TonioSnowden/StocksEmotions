  "text": "<p>Europe's sluggish vaccination campaign received a boost when AstraZeneca secured EU regulatory approval for its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-treatment\">coronavirus vaccine</a>, even as French president Emmanuel Macron cast doubt over the jab's effectiveness for older people.</p> <p>The European Medicines Agency on Friday said it backed the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab for all individuals aged 18 and over, as Germany and France expressed concern over its effectiveness on those aged 65 and over.</p> <p>Hours before the EMA decision on Friday, President Macron said: “Today everything suggests that (the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine) is almost ineffective for those over 65, and some say over 60.” </p> <p>The French leader's comments came after Germany's independent vaccination advisory commission recommended the jab's use for under-65s only, saying on Thursday that it lacked data on its efficacy for older people. </p> <p>The EMA acknowledged that most study participants were aged between 18 and 55, and that there were “not yet enough results” in participants older than 55 to provide a figure of efficacy in those groups. But protection was nevertheless expected, it said.</p> <p>This was because an immune response was seen in an age group and because of experience with other vaccines, the regulator said. UK regulators made similar remarks when they approved the vaccine last year.</p> <p>Marco Cavaleri, the head of the EMA's vaccines strategy, told a press conference on Friday that the immune response seen in elderly patients was “extremely reassuring”.</p> <p>The vaccine is the third to be approved by the EU regulator, after jabs developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna. The approval comes as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dbfe495-5947-4dd0-9f43-5edc5e6d6dc7\">EU is struggling to get the supplies of doses</a> it was promised and shortages are starting to be felt in regions including the Madrid and Paris areas.</p> <p>Brussels is pressing AstraZeneca to reverse a cut of about three-quarters to the 100m doses that have been ordered by the bloc. Moderna meanwhile said volumes of its vaccine that are due to be shipped to Italy would be 20 per cent less than planned. France's ministry of health said on Friday it was expecting 25 per cent fewer doses from the US biotech group than had originally been scheduled next month. The struggle has prompted the EU to tighten conditions for vaccine exports.</p> <p>The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab is a crucial part of the plans of many countries in the EU and beyond because it is cheaper and requires less intense refrigeration than the mRNA technology vaccines of BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna. The European bloc has ordered 300m doses of the AstraZeneca drug, with an option to take 100m more.</p> <p>More vaccines are coming online in the next months: on Friday, Johnson &amp; Johnson said its single-shot jab showed overall efficacy figures of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d05c7c57-da11-42a1-aa33-b66052c904ac\">66 per cent</a>. The day before, US biotech company Novavax reported an efficacy rate of 89 per cent in a UK phase-3 trial and said it was likely to file for authorisation in the UK next month.</p> <p>Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive, said on Friday that the approval underscored the protection the jab offered against severe disease and hospitalisations. </p> <p>“We are deeply grateful&#xa0;to Oxford university, participants in the clinical trials and AstraZeneca colleagues for their unwavering commitment to providing this life-saving vaccine to millions of Europeans,” he said.</p> <p>The EMA focused on studies in the UK and Brazil, because they had enough Covid-19 cases, to calculate how well it worked. Patients received two standard doses between four and 12 weeks apart, which showed a 59.5 per cent reduction in the number of symptomatic Covid-19 cases — or, rounded up, 60 per cent efficacy.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Fleming in Brussels</em></p><p>Source: Michael Peel in Brussels and Donato Paolo Mancini in Rome 2021 'EU regulator approves Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults' FT.com 29 January.
