  "text": "<p>German biotech CureVac has said it is hoping to win regulatory approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in May or June and will aim to produce up to 300m doses this year and 1bn in 2022.</p> <p>Like Moderna and the BioNTech Pfizer partnership, CureVac's jab uses mRNA technology but, while its rivals have raced ahead having won emergency regulatory approval, the Tübingen-based company has fallen almost six months behind schedule.</p> <p>However, the recent pauses in the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine programmes because of rare blood clotting side effects could benefit CureVac. Europe appears to be going all-in on mRNA vaccines, announcing negotiations this week for up to 1.8bn doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine for 2022-2023.<br><br>“[Messenger] RNA has emerged as a key technology that leads the charge against the Covid-19 pandemic,” said CureVac chief executive Franz-Werner Haas in the company's quarterly results statement on Thursday.<br><br>In its results, CureVac announced a loss of €57.3m in the most recent quarter and a €129.8m loss in earnings before taxes in the year ending December 31 2020, compared to a €35.9m and €100m loss in the previous periods. In 2020, it made an operating loss of €109.8m, which it attributed to increased spending on research. <br><br>But the company still maintained a cash position of €1.3bn at the year end, thanks to funding from the German government and its initial public offering in August. </p> <p>Since the IPO, its stock has risen 500 per cent on expectations for its Covid vaccine.<br><br>CureVac's product could have several advantages over rivals. It can be refrigerated for three months and does not require the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/919d16c8-0a40-4389-bac9-04a48fdb0a36\">sub-zero storage needed for other mRNA vaccines</a>. It also requires the smallest amount of active ingredient of any of the mRNA vaccines: 12 micrograms per dose. </p> <p>Pierre Kemula, chief financial officer, said CureVac was “in a great position to accelerate our corporate transformation from a research-oriented biotech to a commercial-stage biopharma company”.</p> <p>Last year, it announced a partnership with pharmaceutical giant Bayer to manufacture its vaccine. In July, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56ef96f3-7433-484b-84fb-f67b3d8a5e47\">GlaxoSmithKline bought a 9 per cent stake and pledged €150m towards joint development</a> of “next-generation” Covid-19 vaccines to tackle new variants.</p> <p>Like other vaccine makers using mRNA, CureVac was researching the use of the technology for cancer treatments before the pandemic. </p> <p>The company said it aimed to use profits to research other mRNA vaccines, including for flu, and to continue developing cancer treatments.</p> <p>“We . . . are now leveraging the solid foundation we laid to further tackle emerging variants in our Covid-19 vaccine programme, advance into second-generation Covid-19 vaccines and infectious diseases and expand our clinical pipeline in oncology and protein therapies,” said Haas.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Erika Solomon in Berlin 2021 'CureVac hopes to win regulatory approval for its Covid vaccine by June' FT.com 15 April.
