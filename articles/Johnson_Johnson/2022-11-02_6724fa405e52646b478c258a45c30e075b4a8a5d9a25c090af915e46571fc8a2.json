  "title": "J&J To Buy Abiomed For About $17 Billion",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J, the world's largest maker of healthcare products by sales, is pursuing its biggest deal in several years as it adapts to a changing healthcare market.</p><p>The company plans next year to separate its consumer-products unit, which sells Tylenol and Band-Aids, into a stand-alone company. The move will leave J&amp;J more concentrated in its remaining two units, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p><p>Chief Executive Joaquin Duato has emphasized strengthening the medical-device unit through deals. It has, like the rest of the industry, struggled to find new, substantial sources of growth. Once J&amp;J's largest business by sales, medical devices have been eclipsed by the company's pharmaceuticals division.</p><p>\"This acquisition is consistent with that strategy, expanding J&amp;J med tech into high-growth markets, and accelerating revenue growth while advancing the standard of care,\" Mr. Duato said.</p><p>Abiomed, and its fast-growing Impella heart pump, could provide a boost. The heart pump is used to treat conditions including a heart attack, heart failure and clogged arteries. J&amp;J expects to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>The bet could face challenges, however, if Impella sales don't increase as much as J&amp;J expects.</p><p>Abiomed has been testing new uses for Impella that could furnish new revenue, but it isn't guaranteed the studies will be positive or that regulators would clear new uses on the timetables that J&amp;J envisions, Stifel analyst Rick Wise said.</p><p>J&amp;J, New Brunswick, N.J., has tried for years to increase sales growth of its medical-device unit. The pressure for a turnaround has grown as the company prepares to hive off its business selling Tylenol, Listerine and other consumer-health products.</p><p>The unit, which sells artificial knees, contact lenses and surgical products, had sales of $27.06 billion in 2021, up 18% from 2020. Sales had rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic. In previous years, however, the unit had moderate growth and sometimes sales declines.</p><p>Abiomed, of Danvers, Mass., is in one of the fastest-growing areas of the medical-device industry.</p><p>The company's sales rose 22% last fiscal year ending March 31 to $1.03 billion. It would bring about $937 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to J&amp;J.</p><p>Founded in 1981, Abiomed acquired the Impella pump with its purchase of Germany's Impella CardioSystems in 2005. The pump was introduced first in Europe and got U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in 2008.</p><p>Abiomed bills Impella as the world's smallest heart pump. For many patients, it is placed in the heart via a catheter inserted into a leg artery, to temporarily assist the heart's pumping function while patients undergo other procedures to treat underlying cardiovascular disease.</p><p>It can also be implanted during surgery.</p><p>J&amp;J executives expect to further accelerate Impella sales by introducing it in more countries and expanding the approved uses for the pump.</p><p>The deal \"will enable us to leverage Johnson &amp; Johnson's global scale, commercial strength and clinical expertise to accelerate our mission of making heart recovery the global standard of care,\" Abiomed Chief Executive Michael Minogue said.</p><p>Mr. Minogue, who has led Abiomed since 2004, will retire upon the deal's closing. Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Greenfield will serve as president, J&amp;J said.</p>",
