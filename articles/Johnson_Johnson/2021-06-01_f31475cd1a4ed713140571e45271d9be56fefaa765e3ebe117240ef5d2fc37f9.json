  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson must pay $2.1bn in damages to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the drugmaker's baby powder, after the US Supreme Court refused to review the case.</p> <p>The judgment was the largest against the company, which has battled a wave of litigation and lost several cases as thousands of people claimed the products led to cancer. The appeal that was denied on Tuesday related to a case filed in Missouri in 2018 involving 22 women.</p> <p>“The decision by the court to not review the Ingham case leaves unresolved significant legal questions that state and federal courts will continue to face,” J&amp;J said, adding that “decades of independent scientific evaluations confirm Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.”</p> <p>Last year, the company said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88b7b5aa-a794-406a-9f7b-558cda8678e5\">stop selling</a> its baby powder in the US and Canada after sales plunged by 60 per cent in three years.</p> <p>The Supreme Court judges kept in place a ruling by a Missouri state court in which the jury ordered J&amp;J to pay <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9957c984-8628-11e8-a29d-73e3d454535d\">$4.7bn</a> in damages, although that penalty was later reduced to $2.12bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The lawsuit featured high-level attorneys on both sides, with Kenneth Starr, former solicitor general of the US, representing the women. In court documents filed in April, he claimed that J&amp;J “knew for decades that their talc powders contained asbestos” and “launched a decades-long cover-up”.</p> <p>In November, the Missouri state court refused to hear J&amp;J's appeal, sending the case to the country's highest court. The drugmaker had argued that by bringing together several separate talcum powder-related claims for trial in front of a single jury, the trial had violated J&amp;J's due process rights under the US constitution.</p> <p>Neal Katyal, former US acting solicitor general, represented J&amp;J and had urged the court to focus on due process. </p> <p>J&amp;J's share price fell 1.9 per cent by Tuesday lunchtime in New York after it became clear the company would not be given a chance to air its arguments and would instead have to pay the award.&#xa0;J&amp;J said that there were “no additional avenues to appeal this case”.</p> <p>Several large US business groups including the Business Roundtable and US Chamber of Commerce had backed the company's appeal. </p> <p>Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc, which, in its natural form, contains asbestos, a substance that can cause cancer. The healthcare industry agreed in 1976 to ensure that all talc products do not contain detectable levels of asbestos.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2021 'Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $2.1bn in talc cancer case after Supreme Court rejection' FT.com 1 June.
