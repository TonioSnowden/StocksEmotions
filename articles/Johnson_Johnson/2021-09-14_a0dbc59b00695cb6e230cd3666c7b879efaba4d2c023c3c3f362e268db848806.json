  "title": "Lightstone Ventures, a Biomedical Investor, Raises $375 Million; The firm, which has an interest in neurological diseases, bested its last fund after some of its portfolio companies were acquired or went public",
  "text": "<p>Those companies include cancer drugmaker ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., which went public last year; Claret Medical Inc., a developer of a device to protect the brain from a stroke during certain heart valve-replacement procedures, which was acquired by Boston Scientific Corp. in 2018; and Disarm Therapeutics Inc., a neurological disease-focused biotech purchased by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. last year.</p><p>Lightstone's new investment pool is one of several healthcare venture funds to close this year. Others raising funds recently include Vida Ventures, which raised $825 million, and venBio, which collected $550 million.</p><p>In addition to its U.S. investments, Lightstone uses offices in Singapore and Dublin as bases for deal-making in Asia and Europe, respectively. In Singapore, Lightstone has backed companies like Ligature Therapeutics Pte. Ltd., which is developing drugs designed to degrade disease-causing proteins. Its European investments include Dublin-based remote-monitoring company Fire1.</p><p>One focus area for Lightstone is neurological diseases. Drugmakers historically have struggled to develop medications for complex brain disorders, but the team sees opportunities to finance startups attacking these diseases in new ways, according to Mr. Lettmann.</p><p>In addition to Disarm Therapeutics, Lightstone has backed startups such as Cerevance Inc., which uses partnerships with brain banks to get access to healthy and diseased brain tissue in an effort to discover new drug targets and disease treatments. It is developing medicines for conditions like Parkinson's and schizophrenia.</p><p>\"We believe that's where the opportunity is, to take on those hard diseases,\" Mr. Lettmann said.</p><p>Lightstone, which plans to invest this new fund in 17 to 20 companies, said it has added two members to its team: Christina Isacson, who joined as a partner, and was previously chief business officer of biotech Magenta Therapeutics Inc.; and Young Kwon, hired as an operating partner, and formerly chief financial and business officer at biotech Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson last year.</p><p>Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com</p>",
