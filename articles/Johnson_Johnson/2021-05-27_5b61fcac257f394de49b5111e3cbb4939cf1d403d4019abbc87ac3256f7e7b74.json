  "title": "A Grand Plan to Vaccinate  The World Unravels  ---  Multibillion-dollar program meant to protect poor countries from Covid  ----  By Gabriele Steinhauser, Drew Hinshaw and Betsy McKay",
  "text": "<p>   This spring, American epidemiologist Seth Berkley had to break some bad news to the world's poorest countries: millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses promised to them weren't coming. </p><p>   The nations were counting on getting shots from Covax -- a multibillion-dollar program to immunize the world, led by Dr. Berkley and championed by the World Health Organization. But shipments from Covax's main supplier in India, where Covid-19 cases were surging, suddenly weren't coming through. </p><p>   Tens of millions of hospital workers who had received one dose were unexpectedly no longer scheduled for a second. The prospects for quickly inoculating other front-line workers and vulnerable people were fading fast. </p><p>   The Covax program, conceived in early 2020 as a kind of Operation Warp Speed for the globe, was supposed to be a model for how to vaccinate humanity, starting with those who needed it the most. The plan was scheduled to have the developing world's entire healthcare workforce immunized by now. </p><p>   Instead, the idealistic undertaking to inoculate nearly a billion people collided with reality, foiled by a basic instinct for nations to put their own populations first, and a shortage of manufacturing capacity around the world. </p><p>   Dr. Berkley and a small crew of global health experts spent months trying to recruit much of the world into buying their vaccines from one common pool, rich and poor countries alike. While they were hammering out the details and raising money, nations that could afford it rushed to secure their own shots first. </p><p>   \"I do understand the political reality,\" Dr. Berkley said. \"People eventually just gave us money and said, good luck competing against us.\" </p><p>   Most of the world's poorest nations were left highly dependent on a single vaccine, produced by a single manufacturer in a single country. In a cruel twist, that supplier -- the Serum Institute of India -- ended up engulfed by the world's worst Covid-19 outbreak. </p><p>   \"Dear Participant,\" Dr. Berkley's office finally wrote in an April 28 email to most of the 92 developing countries counting on Covax. \"We regret to inform you that, given the heightened Covid-19 crisis in India, Covax no longer expects deliveries. . .to resume in May.\" </p><p>   \"We are working to ensure these delays are addressed as soon as possible,\" it said. </p><p>   Dr. Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that secures childhood immunizations for the poorest countries and is the central organization behind Covax, said the facility did its best to navigate a hypercompetitive vaccine market. \"We hear a lot of criticism, and the truth is, we've tried to do something that we think is the right thing,\" he said. \"Hindsight's 20/20. Should we have not invested in India? Well, that was the fastest way to get there.\" </p><p>   Under the original plan, the wealthiest countries would buy enough vaccines for at least 10% of their populations from Covax, which would procure them in bulk. Along with donations, that would help subsidize vaccines for an additional 92 poor nations that would receive their doses free. </p><p>   Covax started shipping Covid-19 vaccines within three months of the world's richest countries administering their first shots -- lightning speed, compared with the five to 10 years it often takes for new immunizations to reach the developing world. </p><p>   Now it is running out of vaccines just when Covid-19 cases are escalating across countries it was meant to protect: the low- and middle-income states of Latin America and South Asia. The program has shipped 72 million shots, far short of the 238 million it had targeted by the end of May. </p><p>   Some 20 million of Covax's shots have come from India, which was due to ship 140 million by the end of the month but stopped exporting them as it works to inoculate the country's 1.3 billion citizens. </p><p>   New lockdowns are devastating economies, and hospital staff are dying in nations that hold some of the lowest ratios of healthcare workers to people. The Serum Institute declined to comment. It has said it expects to restart sending doses to Covax by the end of the year. Gavi said it is hopeful that some supplies, in reduced quantities, will resume in the third quarter. </p><p>   Covid-19 had officially claimed fewer than 80 lives when Dr. Berkley and another vaccine executive, along with Dr. Berkley's physician wife, Cynthia Berkley, first sketched out a vision for vaccine sharing in a hotel lobby at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2020. </p><p>   Previous pandemics, such as HIV and swine flu, swept through poorer countries that couldn't afford or compete against the rich for breakthroughs like antiretroviral drugs or influenza vaccines. </p><p>   This time, Dr. Berkley argued, once a vaccine was developed, rich and poor countries could buy from one collective pool. Every country, including poorer countries, would be able to inoculate hospital workers and the elderly first, only then followed by the rest of the population. </p><p>   Like Operation Warp Speed, the multibillion-dollar initiative the U.S. government would eventually form, this program would make it possible for governments to secure vaccines in advance, said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, who had hashed out the idea with the Berkleys. That would make it easier for countries to manage the risk of investing in medicines still in testing. </p><p>   Gavi, founded with financing from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, teamed up with CEPI, also a Gates-funded organization, which invests in vaccine development for emerging infectious diseases. </p><p>   The WHO backed the idea. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rallied European leaders into joining an April videoconference, during which French President Emmanuel Macron extolled what would eventually be called the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, or Covax. </p><p>   Not on the call: Russia, which was developing its Sputnik V vaccine; China, which was working on its own shots; or the U.S., which didn't join until early 2021. </p><p>   In June, the U.K. hosted a Global Vaccine Summit, where Covax announced its first big supply deal, with AstraZeneca PLC, the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine maker and a longtime partner for Gavi and Gates Foundation-funded projects. Serum was a known, reliable partner, said Trevor Mundel, president of global health at the Gates Foundation. </p><p>   Many rival plants were reluctant to invest in producing vaccines still in testing \"because they didn't think the vaccines would work,\" said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, then the chairwoman of Gavi's board and now director general of the World Trade Organization. By the time the vaccines were proven to work, it would be too late to set up new production lines for deliveries this spring. </p><p>   Serum was meant to be the first big supplier in a diversified portfolio of vaccines manufactured around the world. But by late July, Covax had less than $600 million in cash to buy 2 billion shots. Many early donor pledges hadn't yet been released, leaving Gavi on the hook if they fell through. Executives at a Gavi board meeting said they wouldn't sign purchasing commitments without cash in hand, according to minutes seen by the Journal. </p><p>   Wealthy countries, including ones that had promised to fund Covax, were buying their own doses first. In late May, the U.K. had sealed its own agreement with AstraZeneca. The U.S., without a commitment to Covax, had signed up for 300 million from AstraZeneca, pledging up to $1.2 billion. </p><p>   In June, the European Union, worried that its own countries would start competing for limited supply, stepped in to buy shots for its 450 million citizens. The EU blocked governments from joining parallel vaccine purchasing programs. That meant France and Germany were barred from buying doses from the pool they had championed. An EU spokeswoman said the institution required vaccine makers in its portfolio to commit to providing shots to poor countries and its contracts allow member states to donate doses to developing nations. </p><p>   The EU concluded talks with vaccine makers -- a collaboration between Sanofi SA and GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &amp; Johnson, CureVac NV, and Moderna Inc. -- and signed a 400 million-dose deal with AstraZeneca, and a 300 million-dose deal with Pfizer Inc. </p><p>   Then, having bought enough doses to cover its entire population twice over, the EU pledged to donate 400 million euros to Covax, to buy 88 million doses for poorer countries. </p><p>   Covax's staff had been stretched trying to recruit more than 100 countries, according to officials familiar with the operation. The structure  had become complex. </p><p>   The wealthier countries had complicated requests that took weeks to accommodate.  Poorer countries had their own requirements. A Gavi spokeswoman said those conversations didn't delay deals. </p><p>   What started as a collective effort to share vaccines was becoming a charity drive. A few wealthy countries -- including the U.K., Canada, South Korea and New Zealand -- agreed to buy at least some doses from Covax. Most chose to make straightforward donations. </p><p>   By late December, after months of haggling over prices, Covax had 2 billion doses lined up, enough to vaccinate some 20% of the population in over 100 countries. Yet most were soft agreements with no clear delivery dates or involved drugmakers whose shots hadn't yet panned out. As Europe and the U.S. began to vaccinate, Covax's only completed purchases were with AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute. </p><p>   Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm and Sputnik V had all announced promising efficacy results from clinical trials. Covax began to have encouraging conversations with wealthy countries open to donating excess vaccines. </p><p>   Variants in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil prompted concerns over whether countries needed to administer third doses, or shots for children. \"Suddenly all the conversations about dose sharing stopped,\" said an official familiar with Covax's operations. </p><p></p>",
