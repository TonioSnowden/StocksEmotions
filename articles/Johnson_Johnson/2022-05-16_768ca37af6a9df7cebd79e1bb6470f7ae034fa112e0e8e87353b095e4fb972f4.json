  "title": "O-I Glass Unit Approved for $610 Million Asbestos Bankruptcy Plan; Paddock Enterprises, a vehicle to carry its parent company's asbestos liabilities into chapter 11, won approval of a bankruptcy plan",
  "text": "<p>The bankruptcy plan relies on funding from the parent company's Owens-Illinois glassmaking business to compensate individuals who allege they were exposed to asbestos from a corporate predecessor's Kaylo insulation products.</p><p>O-I used a Delaware corporate reorganization to fill Paddock with asbestos liabilities before placing it in bankruptcy, isolating them from the rest of the business. That allowed O-I to drive a resolution of the asbestos claims in bankruptcy, while keeping the valuable glassmaking operation out of chapter 11.</p><p>The Delaware reorganization that landed Paddock in bankruptcy \"of course raised the antennae of everyone who was in the courtroom,\" Judge Silverstein said from the bench on Monday. But the resulting bankruptcy plan pays injury claims at 100 cents on the dollar, she said.</p><p>\"This was a mechanism by which it could be done, notwithstanding the perhaps controversial way in which the case presented itself here,\" the judge said.</p><p>Large, solvent businesses including Georgia-Pacific LLC, Trane Technologies PLC and Johnson &amp; Johnson have used similar reorganizations under Texas law to isolate asbestos liabilities in corporate subsidiaries that then filed for bankruptcy, touching off contentious litigation with personal-injury lawyers.</p><p>Paddock's chapter 11 case was placid by comparison, yielding a $610 million settlement that earned the support of more than 99% of the 69,000 asbestos claimants who cast ballots, according to court papers.</p><p>James Patton, a lawyer who represented the interests of future claimants, said in a sworn declaration last week that there was consensus in negotiations that asbestos claims should be valued in the bankruptcy plan based on how much the business had historically paid to settle with people alleging exposure from Kaylo products.</p><p>Paddock \"did not engage in aggressive litigation tactics,\" which also helped ease a successful deal, Mr. Patton said. He and other court-appointed representatives for asbestos victims also scrutinized the prebankruptcy transactions that created Paddock, as well as its funding agreement with its parent company, court papers show.</p><p>The chapter 11 plan accelerates payments to injury victims, avoids costly litigation in the tort system and provides certainty that funding will be available as more people alleging Kaylo exposure get sick, Mr. Patton said.</p><p>Asbestos litigation had dragged on the business for decades, costing roughly $5 billion to defend and settle some 400,000 exposure claims before Paddock's 2020 bankruptcy filing, court papers show. Judge Silverstein said there was no evidence the plan was put forward \"in anything other than good faith.\"</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
