  "title": "World News: Vaccine Sales Scams Proliferate Globally --- Developing countries, desperate for shots, are at greatest risk; dubious offers spotted",
  "text": "<p>Some of the governments were offered either vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Johnson &amp; Johnson as well as AstraZeneca PLC, according to the people and copies of illegitimate contracts and letters of intent reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Some negotiated detailed contracts, before calling off the talks and realizing the offers were scams, the people said.</p><p>France doesn't negotiate directly with distributors of vaccines but gets them through the European Commission, a spokeswoman for French President Emmanuel Macron said. Brazil didn't end up buying vaccines that were offered by third-party brokers, President Jair Bolsonaro's office said, although it confirmed there were talks. Latvia's vaccines are purchased within the contracts signed by the European Commission and vaccine manufacturers, said a country representative.</p><p>Offers from people and companies to Austrian public agencies or the chancellery that appeared to be serious turned out to be dubious and were referred to authorities, an Austrian government spokesman said. Colombia received proposals from vendors who later dropped them after being pressed by the government to prove they were working with drugmakers, according to German Escobar, chief of staff for the Health Ministry. He said the country ultimately negotiated contracts directly with manufacturers. Meanwhile, Argentina only signed contracts directly with vaccine makers, a government spokesman said.</p><p>Investigators at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have identified between 50 and 75 scammers, businesses and brokers looking for prospective governments willing to buy, the people said.</p><p>It couldn't be determined if any offers have been successful, and the activity is believed to be happening in developing nations where Covid-19 vaccine supply remains limited, according to the people. Some countries have completed investigations, although others continue, according to Pfizer and government officials familiar with the investigations.</p><p>Many governments are desperate for vaccines because of limited supply. International law-enforcement officials and a security expert said they are concerned that limited vaccine supply in some countries could prompt government officials to unwittingly sign bogus contracts.</p><p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, through Homeland Security Investigations' National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, and its partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, has more than a dozen investigations into vaccine contract-related crimes and is investigating vaccine-contract fraud in the U.S. and overseas, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Interpol, the international police organization, is planning to issue an alert in the coming days to governments warning them about potential scams, in hopes of soliciting information to aid ongoing investigations, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Vaccine makers said they still only sell their vaccines directly to governments, so there are no intermediaries public officials should be working through. European Union member governments and regional or local authorities cannot purchase vaccines directly from any supplier.</p><p>Pfizer is aware of 86 fraudulent offers to governments in 45 countries involving the shot, said Lev Kubiak, head of Pfizer's security. The company shares information on fraud it gleans with law enforcement and governments, as well as rival vaccine makers, he said.</p><p>\"We're worried that eventually, at one point or another, some government may become fooled,\" he said. \"Some of those countries that are most desperate are at greatest risk.\"</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson referred to an April statement on its website saying it is aware of fraudulent campaigns that offer its vaccine for sale, and said no private companies are authorized to sell or distribute the shot on behalf of the drugmaker.</p><p>AstraZeneca said there is no private-sector supply, sale or distribution of its vaccine and that if someone offers private vaccines, they are likely counterfeit, so should be refused and reported to local health authorities.</p><p>---</p><p>James Marson contributed to this article.</p>",
