  "text": "<p>Out of the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500, only consumer discretionary and consumer staples were lower in early afternoon trading.</p><p>The policy adjustment out of Japan took markets by surprise, with the meeting taking place toward the end of Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's 10 years in office. Most central banks across the globe have already started tightening monetary policy to tame inflation and catch up to the U.S. dollar, with Japan one of the few outliers.</p><p>Though the BOJ's interest-rate increase is small compared with those made in the U.S., analysts and investors worry that this marks an end to the yearslong era of easy money everywhere.</p><p>Tightening monetary policy in the U.S. and elsewhere has been a major concern for investors. Recent data has suggested the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases are succeeding in tempering inflation, but Fed officials have signaled their intention to continue to raise rates and keep them elevated for longer than many investors had anticipated.</p><p>Yields rose on U.S. Treasurys, which have largely trended lower in recent weeks as inflation has shown signs of easing. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 3.687% from 3.581% on Monday. Mr. Brill forecasts investors will turn to U.S. fixed income in 2023 because of the higher yields offered, but rising overseas yields might steer foreign bond investors elsewhere.</p><p>\"The concern is always, what will happen if local yields become more competitive with U.S. yields, and today's the first step of that?\" said Matt Brill, Invesco Fixed Income's head of North America investment grade. \"The markets are wondering, where does it stop?\"</p><p>In stocks, Tesla shares fell 5.2%, with its market capitalization falling below that of Johnson &amp; Johnson for the first time since late 2020. Several analysts have cut their price targets on Tesla stock in recent days.</p><p>Tech stocks like Tesla are particularly sensitive to interest rates and have been some of the biggest drivers to this year's roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500 as rates have risen.</p><p>Next year \"could be the start of a bottoming process, so that's what we're hoping for,\" said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies and portfolio manager of the Fairlead Tactical Sector exchange-traded fund. Ms. Stockton forecasts that defensive stocks, which have dominated this year, won't be as popular with investors next year.</p><p>Until Tuesday, the Bank of Japan had employed ultraloose monetary policies for years. The BOJ has long intervened to keep its government-bond yields within a range near zero, indirectly helping to keep global borrowing costs down. That, in turn, made Japanese investors some of the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasurys over the years.</p><p>The yen rose more than 3% against the dollar, while the yield on Japan's 10-year government bonds jumped to 0.417%. They had previously been capped by the central bank at 0.25%.</p><p>The move also comes in a typically quiet period, when liquidity is low and markets are highly sensitive to surprises, said James Binny, global head of currency at State Street Global Advisors.</p><p>\"The Bank of Japan has been the one central bank that has been sticking resolutely to very loose monetary policy. So from that perspective, it has been the one anchor holding interest rates down,\" Mr. Binny said. \"It is more of a tweak than a serious change in policy, but it is significant as it heralds a more substantial change to come.\"</p><p>The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, fell 0.7%.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 1.3% to $78.79 a barrel. Gold prices rallied 1.8% to about $1,829.20 a troy ounce.</p><p>Asian indexes fell, led by losses for Japan's Nikkei 225 index, which closed down 2.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.3% while China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.1%. In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.2%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Edges Higher After Surprise Bank of Japan Adjustment</p>",
