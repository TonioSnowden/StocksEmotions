  "text": "<p>The shot is one of three for Covid-19 authorized or approved in the U.S., but its use in the U.S. has lagged that of vaccines developed by other manufacturers. U.S. health regulators briefly paused the use of the vaccine in April of last year as they investigated rare blood-clotting conditions.</p><p>The company cut its full-year sales guidance from between $95.9 billion and $96.9 billion to between $94.8 billion and $95.8 billion. The company also slashed its adjusted earnings outlook from between $10.40 a share and $10.60 a share to between $10.15 a share and $10.35 a share.</p><p>About 16.9 million Americans have been vaccinated with J&amp;J's single-dose shot, a fraction of the number who have been immunized with shots made by Moderna Inc. and by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those companies' booster shotshave also seen far more use in the U.S. than J&amp;J's.</p><p>Overall, higher sales from J&amp;J's pharmaceuticals and medical-devices segments contributed to a 5% rise in revenue. Sales in the consumer business fell slightly from a year earlier.</p><p>In the first quarter, J&amp;J posted overall sales of $23.43 billion, compared with $22.32 billion a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting quarterly sales of $23.62 billion.</p><p>Profit was $5.15 billion, or $1.93 a share, down from $6.19 billion, or $2.32 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, J&amp;J's per-share profit was $2.67. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting an adjusted profit of $2.58, according to FactSet.</p><p>In the consumer business, sales were hampered by supply constraints that mostly held back the company's skin-care and beauty products. The segment's adjusted operational sales, which exclude the impact of divestitures and translational currency, rose 1.6%, driven by sales of over-the-counter products, including Tylenol, Motrin and Imodium.</p><p>Pharmaceutical sales rose 6.3% to $12.87 billion, helped by sales of the company's Covid-19 vaccine, as well as other products, including Darzalex, a treatment of multiple myeloma, and Stelara, a treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as other products.</p><p>The results come as the company prepares to separate its consumer-health division from its prescription-drug and medical-device units. That split will likely come in 2023, at the earliest.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Suspends Covid Vaccine Sales Guidance, Citing Supply Surplus</p>",
