  "title": "Bankruptcy Judge Declines to Pause Talc Litigation Against Johnson & Johnson; But LTL Management, a J&J subsidiary, will get another chance to stop litigation against its parent company in early November",
  "text": "<p>Instead, the personal-injury lawsuits will only be paused against the newly formed J&amp;J subsidiary that was put into chapter 11 earlier this month and its corporate predecessor, the judge said during a hearing. The ruling effectively limits, at least until early November, the scope of the J&amp;J subsidiary's bankruptcy stay, a powerful legal tool that immediately halts all lawsuits against a company when it files chapter 11.</p><p>The stay is one of the biggest benefits bankruptcy affords troubled companies. The J&amp;J subsidiary, called LTL Management LLC, is arguing that its stay should also include its parent company—even though it is not in chapter 11—because they both have coverage rights under shared insurance policies and because the two corporate entities, though distinct, are \"inherently intertwined\" by the same talc-injury claims.</p><p>Judge Whitley said on Friday he wasn't ready to decide those legal questions yet, saying he was asked by the J&amp;J subsidiary to issue a temporary restraining order under \"very rushed and unprepared circumstances.\"</p><p>J&amp;J may have independent liability that wasn't absorbed by the LTL Management bankruptcy, Judge Whitley said, though he added that he didn't have evidence to make such a determination and doesn't know the particular details of the nearly 40,000 talc-related lawsuits that have been filed.</p><p>The lawsuits allege that talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses. J&amp;J maintains its talc-based products, which it stopped selling in the U.S. and Canada last year, don't cause ovarian cancer and have never contained asbestos.</p><p>The court also left to November questions on the restructuring J&amp;J undertook to put the talc liabilities into bankruptcy. J&amp;J first shifted its talc-related liabilities and assets to a Texas subsidiary, using a state law that allows splitting corporate assets from liabilities through what are known as divisional mergers.</p><p>The Texas subsidiary was subsequently converted into a North Carolina-based company—LTL Management—shortly before the chapter 11 filing. Such corporate restructuring has been used before other asbestos-related bankruptcies filed in North Carolina.</p><p>Depending on your perspective, Judge Whitley said, a Texas divisional merger is either a \"brilliant strategy\" that gets public corporations the benefits of chapter 11 without the pitfalls of putting the entire enterprise into bankruptcy.</p><p>Or, the idea of a solvent company dividing itself and putting its \"bad\" parts into bankruptcy in order to benefit its \"good\" parts generally strikes personal-injury claimants as \"manifestly unfair,\" the judge said.</p><p>\"From that perspective, the idea that corporate profits might win out over human tragedy is not something that sounds very palatable,\" Judge Whitley said.</p><p>Talc injury lawsuits have been litigated for years. J&amp;J has defeated some lawsuits and lost others, resulting in roughly $3.5 billion in settlements and verdicts, according to court papers. LTL Management, the J&amp;J subsidiary, was formed on Oct. 12 and filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 14.</p><p>J&amp;J has said bankruptcy provides a forum to fairly compensate all claimants and likely more quickly than through the typical trial system.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
