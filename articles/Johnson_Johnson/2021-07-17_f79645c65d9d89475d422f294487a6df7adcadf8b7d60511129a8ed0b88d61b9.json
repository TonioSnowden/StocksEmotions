  "text": "<p>The chemical isn't an ingredient in sunscreens or cosmetics.</p><p>A spokesman for S.C. Johnson &amp; Son Inc., the consumer-goods conglomerate that owns Sun Bum, said it has been examining the Sun Bum gel since May when Valisure disclosed its test results and petitioned U.S. regulators to remove the products.</p><p>\"Until we have concrete facts, we don't want to announce we are recalling the product,\" the S.C. Johnson spokesman said.</p><p>\"We are examining the best path forward,\" the spokesman added.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson and CVS Health Corp. said this week they would stop selling sun-care products that were named by Valisure as having batches with similarly high concentrations of benzene.</p><p>J&amp;J is recalling most of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens from U.S. stores, while CVS halted sales of two store-brand products.</p><p>J&amp;J said it was investigating the cause of the contamination to its products and said the benzene levels were low and not expected to cause health issues.</p><p>A CVS spokesman said the company halted sales of its two products \"out of an abundance of caution.\"</p><p>Founded in 2010, Sun Bum makes sun-care and baby-care products that aren't tested on animals and are free of paraben and gluten.</p><p>In recent years, Sun Bum has introduced hair-care and lip-care items.</p><p>It was acquired by S.C. Johnson in 2019.</p><p>Other brands made Valisure's list, though the J&amp;J, CVS and Sun Bum products had among the highest benzene concentrations, according to Valisure.</p><p>Two other Sun Bum products had very low benzene levels in the Valisure tests.</p>",
