  "text": "<p>Emergent Factory</p><p>Hundreds of millions more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than previously disclosed were destroyed because of quality problems at Emergent BioSolutions Inc.'s Baltimore plant, according to a report from Congress.</p><p>In total, key ingredients that would have amounted to roughly 400 million Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca PLC vaccine doses were discarded, according to the report, released Tuesday by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p><p>Republicans on the subcommittee said they felt Democrats had used their investigative power to attack Emergent.</p><p>Emergent disputed the 400 million figure, saying the doses are difficult to estimate. A J&amp;J spokesman said the company has worked to make a safe, high-quality vaccine. AstraZeneca didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>-- Liz Essley Whyte</p><p>---</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>House Measure</p><p>Lets Staff Unionize</p><p>The House on Tuesday voted to allow lawmakers' staff to unionize, a change Democratic proponents said could lead to improved working conditions on Capitol Hill for thousands of workers but Republican critics said was unnecessary.</p><p>The resolution will grant congressional workers the right to unionize and bargain collectively without fear of retaliation. Senate staff isn't included. With the resolution approved, each lawmaker's office could go to their member of Congress and seek to unionize.</p><p>The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, which handles labor-management issues for legislative branch employees, would have jurisdiction over supervising union elections and recognizing bargaining units and investigating unfair labor practices. Republicans have criticized the unionization effort, calling it unnecessary and messy.</p><p>-- Natalie Andrews, Eliza Collins</p><p>---</p><p>NEW YORK</p><p>State to Direct Funds</p><p>To Abortion Services</p><p>New York will direct $35 million to abortion providers to fund security upgrades and the cost of services for out-of-state patients, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday.</p><p>New York recodified abortion rights in 2019 and already covers abortion services through the Medicaid insurance program. The additional funds are needed because of an expected influx of patients from other states if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, Ms. Hochul said.</p><p>Ms. Hochul's announcement comes as states on both sides of the abortion debate are girding for a blockbuster Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights by the end of June, in a case from Mississippi.</p><p>Lawmakers in New York and California are considering bills that would create special funds for abortion providers. Ms. Hochul said the state Health Department could allocate money from an emergency fund.</p><p>-- Jimmy Vielkind</p><p>---</p><p>BOSTON</p><p>Celebrity Chef Batali</p><p>Found Not Guilty</p><p>A Boston Municipal Court judge found celebrity chef and television host Mario Batali not guilty of indecent assault and battery.</p><p>Judge James Stanton said Mr. Batali's conduct, appearance and demeanor \"were not befitting of a public figure of his stature at that time.\" But he added: \"He's paid a high cost in terms of diminished reputation and financial loss.\"</p><p>In 2018, Natali Tene filed a complaint against Mr. Batali accusing him of sexually assaulting her at a Boston bar and restaurant in 2017. Mr. Batali pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Judge Stanton said that the case was about credibility, and that the accuser has \"significant credibility issues.\"</p><p>Attorneys representing Ms. Tene and Mr. Batali didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said his office wouldn't waiver in its support of Ms. Tene.</p><p>-- Talal Ansari</p>",
