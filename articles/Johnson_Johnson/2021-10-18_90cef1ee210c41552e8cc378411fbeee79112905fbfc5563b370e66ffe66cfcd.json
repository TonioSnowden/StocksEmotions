  "text": "<p>The FDA is trying to greenlight mixing and matching as soon as this week, the people familiar with the matter said. The FDA is also expected to approve Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson boosters this week, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The FDA has authorized extra doses of vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc. for people with compromised immune systems. The FDA has also authorized Pfizer-BioNTech boosters for seniors and other people at high-risk of severe illness.</p><p>Permitting mixing and matching will require amending the labels of the different Covid-19 vaccines so that any of them can be used as boosters for any of the other authorized vaccines, which the FDA is working to do, one of the people said.</p><p>Mixing and matching vaccines has emerged as an issue, as the U.S. has begun a booster campaign to shore up the immune protection generated by vaccines, especially against the contagious Delta variant.</p><p>Some doctors and health authorities have pressed for mixing and matching to simplify logistics of the booster rollout and to ensure that people who want boosters have access to them regardless of their initial vaccine.</p><p>Preliminary data also shows that mixing and matching could provide more protection than sticking with the same vaccine, such as in the case of people who took a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine.</p><p>The FDA's plans to allow mixing and matching was first reported by the New York Times.</p><p>(more to come)</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com</p><p>FDA Nearing Approval for Mixing and Matching Covid-19 Booster Shots</p>",
