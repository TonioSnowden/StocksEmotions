  "title": "Vaccine Mandate for Private Sector Is Here: What to Know; Workers at larger private-sector businesses must get vaccinated or undergo regular Covid-19 testing",
  "text": "<p>The Biden administration says workers at private-sector companies with at least 100 employees will need to get vaccinated or produce a negative Covid-19 test weekly. The administration estimates the rule will cover 84 million workers. It has separately required vaccinations for federal employees and federal contractors. More than 17 million workers must get vaccinated under a federal requirement for workers in health facilities that get Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.</p><p>What is the deadline for employers to implement the vaccine mandate?</p><p>Employers have until Jan. 4, 2022, to ensure their employees are vaccinated. After that date, employers must verify that unvaccinated employees test negative for Covid-19 at least once a week. If an employee tests positive for the virus, they can't be in the workplace. The standard, set to publish in the Federal Register this week, will include more details on the types of Covid tests that are allowed, senior administration officials said. By Dec. 5, employers must also ensure that unvaccinated employees wear a mask in the workplace.</p><p>What proof of vaccination do private-sector workers need to show?</p><p>Employees need to show they are fully vaccinated, meaning they either received two doses of Pfizer or Moderna or one Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. Acceptable documents include a record of immunization from a health provider or pharmacy; a copy of a U.S. Covid-19 vaccination card; medical records; immunization records from public health, state or tribal immunization information system; or a copy of other official documentation that contains the type and dates of vaccination. When documentation can't be obtained, a signed and dated statement from the employee attesting to his or her vaccination status is permitted.</p><p>How will OSHA ensure that employers are complying with the regulation?</p><p>The agency plans to inspect some workplaces. However, a former OSHA official said the agency will likely not rely primarily on in-person inspections, but on company record-keeping and worker reports of potential violations.</p><p>What penalties do employers who don't comply face for not complying with the mandate?</p><p>Businesses that don't comply can face fines of up to about $13,650 per violation.</p><p>What will happen to unvaccinated workers who object to getting vaccinated or tested weekly?</p><p>It is unclear. It is possible employers would dismiss workers who don't comply. Some workers may choose to quit. Slightly under 40% of workers who are unvaccinated say they would leave their job if getting the Covid-19 vaccine was mandated by their employer or if they were required to get tested for the virus weekly, according to survey results from the Kaiser Family Foundation Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor.</p><p>What happens in states where the federal vaccine mandate conflicts with state mandates?</p><p>The federal government's vaccine mandate trumps any inconsistent state or local laws, including ones that hinder employers' authority to require vaccinations, masks or testing, the Biden administration said. In Texas, for instance, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, issued an executive order banning businesses and other private entities in the state from requiring Covid-19 vaccinations for employees.</p><p>Is the vaccine mandate legal?</p><p>There is uncertainty around the legality of vaccine mandates. Both the federal contractor mandate and private-sector one have drawn opposition from states led by Republican governors. Both mandates have drawn opposition from states led by Republican governors. Missouri and nine other GOP-led states sued the Biden administration last week to stop the contractor mandate. Arizona in September sued to stop the private-sector mandate.</p><p>Do workers get paid time off for vaccinations?</p><p>Yes. Employers will need to pay workers for the time it takes to get vaccinated. They will also need to offer paid sick leave for individuals who experience side effects from the vaccine.</p><p>Who will pay for weekly Covid-19 tests for unvaccinated employees?</p><p>It depends. Employers don't need to provide or pay for the weekly Covid-19 tests, meaning that unvaccinated workers in some cases will likely need to pay for their own tests. Employers might be required to fund testing in certain scenarios involving, for instance, collective bargaining agreements, the administration said.</p><p>Write to Sarah Chaney Cambon at sarah.chaney@wsj.com</p><p>Vaccine Mandate for Private Sector Is Here: What to Know</p>",
