  "text": "<p>The FDA has been reviewing data and looking at potentially authorizing a fourth dose of the shot for use in the fall, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.</p><p>Health authorities have cleared booster doses for children as young as 12 years of age, at least five months after they finished their first round of vaccination.</p><p>Health authorities have been urging people to get a booster dose, as studies have shown that Covid-19 vaccines' protection declines over time. Research has shown the booster can strengthen immune systems that have weakened months after initial vaccination.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already recommends fourth doses for people whose immune systems are compromised.</p><p>Countries including Israel, Germany, Sweden and the U.K. have begun or announced plans for second booster doses.</p><p>Researchers are divided on whether additional booster shots are needed, when they should be given and which individuals should receive them.</p><p>There is limited data showing how well a fourth dose works, and it is somewhat mixed.</p><p>In January, Israel's health ministry published an initial study saying a fourth shot provided threefold protection against serious illness and twofold protection against infection compared with people who were four months after their third shot. Other Israeli researchers who did a separate study cast doubt on whether a fourth shot added effective protection against the Omicron variant.</p><p>Pfizer said its submission is based on a pair of real-world studies from Israel that showed an additional dose of vaccine increased immunogenicity and lowered the rates of infections and severe disease.</p><p>Pfizer is still studying how much protection a fourth dose of the current vaccine may provide, part of a broader clinical trial started in January looking at a vaccine tailored to target the Omicron variant.</p><p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told the Journal last month that the goal shouldn't be to simply give everyone another dose every few months, although some high-risk people like the immunocompromised or the elderly may need shots every six months.</p><p>Mr. Bourla told CBS recently that a third dose of the vaccine isn't very good at reducing the risk of infections but is effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and deaths. He said that it will be necessary for people to get a fourth dose.</p><p>Pfizer's pivotal study in 2020 that served as the basis for its emergency-use authorization was measuring symptomatic disease, not disease.</p><p>About 65% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC, meaning they have gotten two doses of the vaccine from either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's shot.</p><p>About 44% of fully vaccinated people have gotten a booster shot, according to the CDC.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are two doses, taken a few weeks apart. The CDC recommends third doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at least five months after the second dose.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
