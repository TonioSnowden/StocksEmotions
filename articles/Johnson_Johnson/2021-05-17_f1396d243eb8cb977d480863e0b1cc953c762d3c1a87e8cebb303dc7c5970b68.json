  "text": "<p>Starbucks and Target are the latest large US companies to re-examine their mask policies after the country's health agency said last week that fully vaccinated individuals no longer have to wear them indoors.</p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that fully vaccinated people could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef26b07c-0213-4653-89ea-a24ccd0d5a8d\">stop wearing face coverings</a> in most indoor and outdoor settings, unless required to by individual states or businesses. </p> <p>The loosening of restrictions has left businesses scrambling to reconsider their own policies on wearing masks. Some large retail chains such as Walmart, Costco and Trader Joe's removed the mask requirement for vaccinated shoppers over the weekend, while others such as department store Macy's are keeping their mask mandates for now.</p> <p>Target said on Monday fully vaccinated customers and staff would no longer need to wear masks, but that “face coverings continue to be strongly recommended for guests and team members who are not fully vaccinated”.</p> <p>Starting Monday, Starbucks customers who are fully vaccinated have the option to go without masks, as long as local law permits, the company said. At CVS, fully vaccinated customers will not be required to wear masks, although the pharmacy chain's employees will continue to do so. </p> <p>The decision to drop the need for face coverings for fully vaccinated people came as Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50477ce9-943b-4f0a-9630-5f2502f21be8\">continue to fall</a> in the US. Nearly 40 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the CDC announcement means businesses and shoppers must rely on trust, resulting in suspicion and anger. Given the legal and ethical conundrum posed by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c399709-9de5-4302-b9fd-849d1b0e522c\">the prospect of vaccine passports</a>, companies are not seeking proof of vaccination from customers, meaning unvaccinated shoppers could enter without a mask.</p> <p>National Nurses United, the largest trade union of nurses in the US, condemned the CDC decision, which Bonnie Castillo, executive director, said “does not protect public health, and threatens the lives of patients, nurses, and other frontline workers across the country.</p> <p>“Now is not the time to relax protective measures, and we are outraged that the CDC has done just that while we are still in the midst of the deadliest pandemic in a century,” she added.</p> <p>Some US states have also moved to relax their mask guidance to bring it in line with the CDC update, including Colorado and Pennsylvania. A few, such as Texas, had already abandoned mask requirements. </p> <p>New York will also adopt the updated guidance from May 19, governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, although he said masks would still be required in some places such as hospitals and public transport.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/527bb88a-96bd-4112-8dd9-bb3747bde7fd.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The CDC considers people fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine or the second dose of Moderna or BioNTech/Pfizer. The new guidance was based on data showing that fully vaccinated individuals are less likely to have coronavirus or transmit the virus to others, the agency said. </p> <p>Some vaccinated people will continue to wear masks, believing that the number of fully immunised people across the country should be far higher before they feel comfortable enough to remove their masks altogether.</p> <p>“I don't think enough people are vaccinated yet. I just think [the CDC] rushed it,” said Cathie English, a reiki instructor from California. “We need to get to a higher vaccination rate. Both my husband and I are fully vaccinated but I will definitely wear a mask when I'm indoors.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Peter Wells in New York</em></p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2021 'More US retailers drop mask rule for fully vaccinated customers' FT.com 17 May.
