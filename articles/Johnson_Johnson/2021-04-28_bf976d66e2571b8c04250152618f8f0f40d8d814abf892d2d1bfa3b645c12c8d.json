  "text": "<p>Teva Pharmaceuticals's chief executive said that its offers to help manufacture coronavirus vaccines were turned down by major makers of the jabs, despite having production capacity ready to deploy.</p> <p>“We've made it clear that we were willing to help but it has not resulted in any agreements,” Kare&#xa0;Schultz, chief executive of Teva, told the Financial Times about conversations with pharmaceutical companies whose vaccines have been authorised for use in the US and Europe.</p> <p>The Israeli drugmaker has production facilities that can package, and fill and finish, vaccine vials. In February, Schultz said it had offered to deploy its resources to help vaccine makers prepare the shots. But he said on Wednesday that the vaccine makers had “found capacity elsewhere that could fulfil the needs they had”.</p> <p>Schultz said that the company remained in discussions with other, smaller vaccine manufacturers but was “not too optimistic” that any deals would be agreed.</p> <p>“The likelihood of a significant agreement is dramatically reduced due to the fact that the big manufacturers that are already in the marketplace with approved vaccines, those discussions didn't come to any agreement,” he said.</p> <p>Schultz said the vaccine makers “have chosen either to go with some of the large established contract manufacturing organisations or with pharma companies with whom they have partnered before”. In March, US drugmaker Merck <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89442c1b-8295-4682-9f09-c040b9017882\">agreed to produce</a> Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-shot vaccine.</p> <p>His comments come as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90281790-fb9e-468c-b3fa-c7549bd3bb39\">India</a> continues to battle with a catastrophic wave of the virus that has overwhelmed the country's health systems. Former world leaders have urged drugmakers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43fd53f5-2b82-4e41-981c-8544a6ce996b\">waive intellectual property rights</a> for coronavirus vaccines, which would make it easier for developing countries to manufacture jabs. </p> <p>Patent waivers have been dismissed by pharmaceutical companies which say they are doing everything they can to increase production, and that waivers would hand <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa1e0d22-71f2-401f-9971-fa27313570ab\">Russia and China access</a> to important technologies.</p> <p>Countries that are struggling with coronavirus have also called on rich nations to share their vaccine doses. This week, the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db461dd7-b132-4f08-a94e-b23a6764bdb3\">said</a> it would send up to 60m of its Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs overseas in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Teva posted its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, reporting adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents, beating analysts' expectations of earnings per share of 59 cents. </p> <p>Revenues were $3.9bn, 9 per cent lower compared to the same period last year because of stockpiling in 2020 and lower demand this year as people missed medical appointments during the pandemic. The company's share price was down 2 per cent.</p> <p>Teva is one of four pharmaceutical companies in the midst of an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3366de85-82bc-434d-b345-9f01816767d7\">opioid trial</a> in California and is accused of engaging in misleading marketing which played down the risks of opioid addiction. The plaintiffs, which include several counties and a city in the state, are seeking billions of dollars in damages. Schultz said that a settlement was “the only right solution”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2021 'Teva says vaccine makers have not taken its offer to help produce jabs' FT.com 28 April.
