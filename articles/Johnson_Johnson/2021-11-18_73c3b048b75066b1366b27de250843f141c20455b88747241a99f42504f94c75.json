  "title": "SEC Probes Hot Drug Firm Over Faked-Research Claim",
  "text": "<p>An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>The National Institutes of Health, which awarded $20 million in grants to Cassava and its academic collaborators since 2015 for drug development, is also examining the claims, according to the company's chief executive officer.</p><p>The accusations appeared in a public petition filed in August to the Food and Drug Administration asking it to suspend Cassava's clinical trials. The petition's authors are two physicians who said they came to doubt Cassava's research and shorted its stock, betting the share price would fall once investors recognized the problems they found, they said. David Bredt, a biotech entrepreneur and former neuroscience research chief at Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., and Geoffrey Pitt, a cardiologist and professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, wrote that Cassava's research, published in several scientific journals, include images of experiments that appear to have been manipulated using software such as Photoshop.</p><p>Cassava CEO Remi Barbier denied the doctors' claims. He said short sellers abused the FDA's petition process, which lets people raise public-health concerns with the government.</p><p>\"There is zero evidence, zero credible evidence, zero proof that I've ever engaged in, nor anyone I know, has ever engaged in funny business,\" Mr. Barbier said last month. Short sellers lodged \"outlandish accusations\" against his company, he wrote this week in an email response to questions. \"Under these conditions you would hope that someone in a position of authority is looking into the legitimacy of the allegations,\" Mr. Barbier wrote.</p><p>Cassava's experimental drug, called Simufilam, aims to restore a protein, filamin A, that its scientists say is misshaped in the brains and blood of Alzheimer's patients. In its contorted state, according to Cassava, the protein triggers a process that leads to the buildup in the brain of a protein called amyloid, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Cassava's journal articles, all co-authored with a professor at the City University of New York School of Medicine, include pictures of experiments that support Cassava's theory for what causes Alzheimer's and how its drug addresses the culprit.</p><p>An Austin biotech company, Cassava shot from obscurity to become a favored stock among individual investors drawn by the prospects for its Alzheimer's treatment. Its stock surged over the summer to as high as $126, when the company's market value eclipsed $5 billion, on the prospects of its drug becoming a new Alzheimer's treatment. It has no commercial drugs and hasn't reported any product revenue since 2013.</p><p>The shares fell to as low as $42 after the public petition was filed to the FDA, which posted it on a website in late August. The stock rose in recent weeks after Cassava said that the Journal of Neuroscience, which published one of its papers, reviewed the images and found no evidence of manipulation. It fell 24% to $47.07 on Wednesday.</p><p>Marina R. Picciotto, editor in chief of the Journal of Neuroscience and a professor at the Yale School of Medicine, confirmed in an email that the journal had found no proof of data manipulation in the papers after requesting the original source data from the authors.</p><p>Several other scientists interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said some images in the articles depicting experimental results appear to have been copied and pasted from other sources. The images show western blots, a lab technique for detecting proteins in samples of tissue or blood. Samples are run through gel and transferred to a film that displays \"bands\" of proteins separated by their molecular weights.</p><p>Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist and image-manipulation consultant who identified inappropriately duplicated images in hundreds of other scientific papers, said she concurred with many of the claims in the petition. Dr. Bik said she found other potentially manipulated images in papers describing how Simufilam works. She doesn't have a position in Cassava's stock, she said.</p><p>Mr. Barbier said the way critics have examined his company's research isn't proper. \"In order to make allegations on the scale that they have, in order for those allegations to be credible, you've got to look at the originals,\" he said. \"Blowing up western blots and, you know, looking for funny faces or funny shapes or whatever . . . it doesn't have legitimacy.\"</p><p>The doctors' petition refers to articles authored by Hoau-Yan Wang, a Cassava adviser and CUNY associate medical professor, and Cassava Senior Vice President Lindsay Burns. Drs. Burns and Wang, who sits on Cassava's scientific advisory board, didn't respond to requests seeking comment.</p><p>The accusations prompted inquiries by the NIH and CUNY, according to Mr. Barbier. A CUNY spokeswoman said, \"The College takes accusations of research misconduct very seriously,\" and would follow university rules for looking into such allegations. An NIH spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>An FDA spokeswoman said it was reviewing the doctors' petition and would respond directly to them.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
