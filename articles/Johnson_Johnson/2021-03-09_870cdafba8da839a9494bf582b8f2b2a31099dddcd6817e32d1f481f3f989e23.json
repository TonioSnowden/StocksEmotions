  "title": "CDC Relaxes Safety Guidance For Fully Vaccinated People",
  "text": "<p>The agency said vaccinated people should continue to hold off on long trips and left its travel guidance unchanged.</p><p>\"Our guidance must balance the risk to people who have been fully vaccinated, the risks to those who have not yet received the vaccine, and the impact on the larger community transmission of Covid-19,\" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said.</p><p>The updated guidance comes as government officials, businesses and individuals try to map a path back toward normalcy, one year after the pandemic first shut down much public life and business as usual across the country. New cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to Covid-19 have fallen in recent weeks following a winter surge, and the effort to inoculate people against the virus is ramping up.</p><p>Public-health officials say people should remain cautious as vaccines continue to roll out, as Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations remain at high levels and more transmissible variants potentially complicate the pandemic's trajectory. President Biden said last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccines for all American adults by the end of May.</p><p>More than 92 million Covid-19 shots have been administered across the U.S., according to CDC data. More than 18% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data, and just over 9% of the population has gotten two shots.</p><p>The seven-day average of daily doses administered has risen to 2.2 million, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of CDC data.</p><p>The president has urged people to wear masks and maintain social-distancing guidelines, while some cities and states such as Texas have recently said they would loosen such restrictions. Mr. Biden, a Democrat, plans to deliver his first prime-time address Thursday to mark the one-year anniversary of initial nationwide shutdowns stemming from the pandemic.</p><p>In its guidance, the CDC said people who are fully vaccinated can visit with unvaccinated members of a single household without wearing masks or maintaining social distancing as long as everyone in that household is at low risk for severe cases of Covid-19.</p><p>If the unvaccinated people come from multiple households, the CDC said, everyone should take precautions such as meeting outside, wearing masks and maintaining at least six feet of distance. The agency said all people should avoid bigger gatherings for now.</p><p>Newly reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. have continued to decline recently, along with hospitalizations, as more people receive vaccinations. Hospitalizations due to Covid-19 across the country totaled 40,212, the lowest level since Oct. 20, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Sunday's total is down nearly 70% from Jan. 6, when hospitalizations peaked at 132,474.</p><p>The U.S. reported 40,340 new confirmed cases for Sunday, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Sunday's figure was down from the 58,062 cases reported the previous day.</p><p>The nation's death toll from confirmed Covid-19 cases has topped 525,000, according to Johns Hopkins data.</p><p>The authorized vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe cases of Covid-19 that could lead to hospitalization or death. It is unclear how effectively they might prevent infection and transmission, but growing evidence suggests that vaccinated people are less likely to get infected and potentially less likely to spread the virus, the CDC said.</p><p>\"Anyone who is fully vaccinated, regardless of their underlying risk, can feel more confidence that they can avoid severe illness from Covid-19,\" said Ajay Sethi, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But, he said, \"We have to recognize that some people can pick up the virus and transmit to others.\"</p><p>A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the second dose of the two-shot vaccines made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE as well as by Moderna Inc., or two weeks after getting the single dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>Vaccinated individuals don't need to quarantine or receive a Covid-19 test after being exposed to the virus if they don't have any symptoms, the CDC said. However, the CDC said that people living together in nonmedical facilities such as prisons should continue to quarantine and get tested following exposure to Covid-19, even after getting vaccinated. Vaccinated employees at such facilities or other densely populated workplaces don't need to quarantine, but should continue to be tested, either following an exposure or as a part of screening programs, the CDC said.</p><p>Vaccinated people are also less likely to get infected during activities such as eating indoors at restaurants or going to the gym, the CDC said, though people should still follow safety precautions in those circumstances. The agency also said fully vaccinated people with Covid-19 symptoms should isolate themselves from others and get tested, even though the risk of infection is low.</p><p>Dr. Walensky said that the CDC will continue to update its guidance as more evidence becomes available.</p><p>For now, the CDC said, everyone should avoid large gatherings regardless of their vaccination status. The CDC didn't update its travel guidance for vaccinated individuals, which includes avoiding nonessential travel and wearing masks on planes, buses, trains and other public transportation.</p><p>\"We would like to give the opportunity for vaccinated grandparents to visit their children and grandchildren who are healthy and who are local, but our travel guidance is currently unchanged,\" Dr. Walensky said.</p>",
