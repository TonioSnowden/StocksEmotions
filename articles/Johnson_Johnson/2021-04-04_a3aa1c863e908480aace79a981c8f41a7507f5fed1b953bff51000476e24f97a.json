  "title": "Johnson & Johnson takes over US Covid vaccine factory after 15m doses spoiled",
  "text": "<p>A pharmaceutical plant that was producing ingredients for Covid-19 vaccines developed by both AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson will exclusively supply the latter company after a mistake by workers spoiled millions of doses. &#xa0;</p> <p>US-based J&amp;J said it was <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-statement-on-u-s-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-updated\">“assuming full responsibility”</a> at the plant in Baltimore owned by Emergent BioSolutions. UK-based AstraZeneca said it would <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca-us.com/media/press-releases/2021/statement-on-azd1222-us-government-drug-substance-production-04032021.html\">move Covid-19 vaccine production</a> out of the facility to another location. </p> <p>A reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc05beba-ef13-4db6-8bb0-ffc4ed94df29\">15m doses</a> of J&amp;J's vaccine were ruined last week after workers accidentally mixed ingredients for the jab and those for the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot.</p> <p>The error was a setback to efforts to instil confidence in people <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a16f791-abd0-4cdb-8fe8-626388d39d88\">wary of the vaccines</a> developed to combat a virus that has killed more than 550,000 people in the US. </p> <p>J&amp;J last week said it had identified a batch of drug substance that did not meet quality standards at the plant owned by Emergent, a New York-listed life sciences company. </p> <p>In an update over the weekend, J&amp;J said it was increasing the ranks of manufacturing, quality and technical operations personnel to work at the Baltimore plant as it took over responsibilities for vaccine production.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet J&amp;J reiterated its intention to deliver <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5ba2702-3bad-4f10-9d80-00eb3d48d802\">almost 100m doses</a> of its vaccine to the US government by the end of May. The US has fully vaccinated 61m people, of which 4m received J&amp;J's single-dose jab, according to <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">data</a> from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&#xa0;</p> <p>Emergent's Baltimore plant has not yet secured emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration to manufacture substances for the vaccine, and J&amp;J said it would work towards that goal.</p> <p>AstraZeneca said it was working with the federal government to carry out plans to produce its vaccine in the US. </p> <p>“As part of that effort, and in full co-operation with the US government, AstraZeneca will relocate production” of its vaccine drug substance from the Emergent facility, it said.&#xa0;</p> <p>The moves came after the Biden administration put J&amp;J in charge of the Baltimore plant and moved to stop it from making the AstraZeneca vaccine, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/emergent-vaccine-plant-johnson-johnson.html\">New York Times reported</a>, citing senior federal health officials.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Gregory Meyer in New York 2021 'Johnson &amp; Johnson takes over US Covid vaccine factory after 15m doses spoiled' FT.com 4 April.
