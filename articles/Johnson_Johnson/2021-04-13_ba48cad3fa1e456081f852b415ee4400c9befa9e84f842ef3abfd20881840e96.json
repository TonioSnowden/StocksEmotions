  "text": "<p>A surprise text</p><p>Amy Kugler joined a long line of people waiting to get their vaccines at an event center in Seattle. It was the first time in more than a year that she had been around so many people, even if they were physically distanced.</p><p>Ms. Kugler, a 39-year-old communications and content consultant, had thought she would be one of the last members of her family to be vaccinated.</p><p>Then, in late March, she got a text from the city government telling her she was eligible. She has high blood pressure and asthma.</p><p>She didn't believe it at first. \"I was looking in shock, handing the phone to my husband and saying, is this legit?\" she said.</p><p>She got an appointment for March 31 at the Lumen Field Event Center, where there was a mass vaccination site.</p><p>Ms. Kugler felt energy and hope in the air as she filed into the space. Volunteers cheered. Some people waiting in line had dressed up. One woman was wearing a Princess Leia costume.</p><p>Ms. Kugler burst into tears as she sat down to get her vaccine and gave her information to a volunteer. She lost a job at the beginning of the pandemic and had to build a new career. Her 3-year-old son sat in on work Zoom meetings with her or her husband when daycare was closed. Her grandmother died and she had to attend the funeral on Facebook. She hasn't seen her parents, who live in other cities, since 2019.</p><p>She looked up at the nurse who gave her her shot, and saw that she was crying too. So were people at tables to Ms. Kugler's left and right. Ms. Kugler kept crying as she sat in a chair for her 15 minute waiting period.</p><p>The vaccination was \"a remembrance of all that we've lost this year,\" Ms. Kugler said. \"It is randomly all in one moment difficult and beautiful.\"</p><p>A storm, an email and a freezing wait</p><p>On a Monday morning in February, Rice University senior Sophie Clayton woke up to an email from her dorm leader. The cold snap that was causing power outages in Texas meant that 800 or so Covid-19 shots were being offered to university faculty, staff and students on campus in Houston.</p><p>Minutes later, she grabbed her mask, put pants and a jacket over her pajamas and joined friends in a line of around 600 people.</p><p>At 21 years old, Ms. Clayton wasn't officially authorized to get the vaccine in Texas, but officials made the call to offer the doses after realizing they could go to waste. With classes canceled, Ms. Clayton, who is majoring in cognitive sciences and psychology, had time to wait.</p><p>It was hard to keep warm outside in the 20-degree weather, and she and two friends passed around a cup of boiling water that volunteers gave them.</p><p>It took three hours for Ms. Clayton to reach the building where student volunteers administered her vaccine. Ms. Clayton was reluctant to celebrate because she got her shot before her dad, who was at higher risk. \"It was not a great feeling,\" she said. \"It did motivate me to get him on every wait list possible.\"</p><p>Taking to the skies</p><p>After a month of unsuccessfully trying to secure a vaccine near his home in the Chicago suburbs as well as in Arizona where his mother lives, Daniel Beider, 47, had a far-fetched plan.</p><p>Through Facebook, he found out he could get the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot at a state-supported mass vaccination site a 10-hour round trip from his home by car. Reluctant to make the journey by road, Mr. Beider searched online and found out he could make the trip in a small aircraft. He opted to fly in a nine-seater plane from Chicago's O'Hare airport to Quincy, Ill.</p><p>Despite being nervous about flying on small planes, Mr. Beider, who works in commercial real estate, was willing to go anywhere to get vaccinated. He shares custody of his two school-age children with their mother, and exposure to others with Covid-19 had at times prevented him from seeing them. \"I hated missing any scheduled time with them,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Beider, his sister and niece were the only passengers on the small Cape Air plane when it took off for the one-hour trip in March. They chatted with the pilot about where to sit to equally distribute their weight. The plane flew at a lower altitude and a slower speed than a larger aircraft. \"It was bumpy, but nice,\" he said.</p><p>Once they landed, they took a ride-share service to the state-run facility. It was nearly empty and the family was done in less than 30 minutes. Mr. Beider said he felt \"joy and relief,\" especially because he didn't need to return for a second shot. \"It was definitely an adventure,\" he said. \"It's the sort of thing we'll tell our grandkids.\"</p><p>Two vaccines for one</p><p>When Mireya Diaz-Granados, 85, took a taxi from her home in New York City to a nearby school to get her Moderna vaccine on Valentine's Day, she was determined to get her granddaughter Kristina Lopez, 34, a shot too.</p><p>Ms. Diaz-Granados, a retired secretary, dressed festively for her appointment with a red sweater, two heart stickers on her blue N95 mask and her signature blue hair. Outside the vaccination site, she said she was greeted with smiles. \"They treated me very good,\" said Ms. Diaz-Granados, who uses a walker. \"They let me go inside right away.\"</p><p>The women asked one of the workers outside about getting another shot, but were denied. Once inside, Ms. Diaz-Granados wanted to ask again straight away, but Ms. Lopez preferred to wait for the right time. She had spent weeks scouting appointments and knew the program was geared toward seniors, even though the two live together and she qualifies as her grandmother's caretaker. Ms. Diaz-Granados wasn't willing to give up. \"I said, 'If you don't ask, I'm going to ask,'\" she said.</p><p>The second time, Ms. Diaz-Granados spoke to the site's supervisor and the answer was yes.</p><p>Both women were vaccinated within minutes. Ms. Lopez helped her grandmother make a video for Ms. Diaz-Granados's TikTok account about the experience. Ms. Diaz-Granados posed for photos in front of a Valentine's Day-themed classroom door.</p><p>Ms. Diaz-Granados said she was happy to be vaccinated, but added that younger generations also need shots so they can lead full lives. \"I thought that I should not get the vaccine, let the young people get the vaccination first,\" she said.</p><p>A vaccine through a car window</p><p>Ashlynn Rushin hasn't seen her 65-year-old father, who has Parkinson's disease and lives in Sacramento, Calif., since 2019.</p><p>The 33-year-old, who lives in Bethany Beach, Del., wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible so she could finally see him. He fell a few weeks ago, she said, and had to have emergency surgery. Some clients of the commercial cleaning business she runs were eager for her to get vaccinated.</p><p>As the state opened up eligibility, Ms. Rushin scouted around for doses. Finally, she and her husband, Michael Rushin, a 35-year-old golf professional, got slots at a drive-through mass vaccination clinic at the Dover International Speedway.</p><p>Waiting their turn, Ms. Rushin started to tear up as she saw the other cars in line, \"everybody making this group effort after this last year where it really felt like there was no end in sight, you know every day which seemed like it got worse.\"</p><p>She worried that doses would run out before she and her husband got their turn. But after about an hour, vaccinators in scrubs were at their car window, asking which arm they would like the shot to go in.</p><p>When it was over, she and her husband felt an overwhelming sense of relief. With tears flowing as she sat out the 15-minute post-vaccination wait period, she looked up flights to Sacramento.</p><p>\"This feeling of helplessness, the feeling of not being able to be there -- it's nice that I don't have to worry about that anymore,\" she said.</p>",
