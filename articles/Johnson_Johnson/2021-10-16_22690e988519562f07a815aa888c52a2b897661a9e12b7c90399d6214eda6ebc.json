  "title": "U.S. News: J&J Vaccine Booster Gets Nod From Panel",
  "text": "<p>The FDA could decide on whether to clear a J&amp;J booster within days.</p><p>The committee members, meeting virtually online, opted not to take a vote on whether it would be better for people to wait at least six months after the first dose to get the J&amp;J booster shot. Panel members said the evidence was too limited for whether to wait six months for the booster.</p><p>J&amp;J had requested that the FDA authorization recommend people wait six months, though they could get the booster as early as two months after the first dose. The company presented evidence showing varying effects when the booster is given between two and six months after the first dose.</p><p>The meeting is the latest by experts whose counsel the FDA has sought before making authorization decisions.</p><p>Their recommendation for J&amp;J recipients includes everyone who has received the single-dose vaccine, making it more permissive than the authorization for the booster vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, which is cleared for seniors and other high-risk adults.</p><p>The advisers voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend the FDA authorize a Moderna Inc. booster to a similar group of people as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. An FDA decision is pending.</p><p>The single-dose J&amp;J shot had lower efficacy against Covid-19 disease than the two-dose mRNA vaccines in studies. Committee members said it was important to give people who received the single shot similar protection to those who received the mRNA vaccines, which are made by Pfizer-BioNTech and by Moderna.</p><p>\"The single dose does not seem to afford as much protection as the mRNA vaccines did, so this is really with the second dose bringing it on par with those other vaccines in terms of effectiveness,\" said Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School and a member of the committee.</p><p>The FDA also is weighing whether people who first get one vaccine should get booster shots of a different vaccine. The vaccine advisory committee discussed a study of that approach at the meeting Friday.</p><p>Preliminary data from a federal study released Wednesday suggests that people who originally got the J&amp;J vaccine would get a stronger immune response from a booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, rather than another J&amp;J dose.</p><p>Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the agency may authorize mixing and matching primary vaccinations and booster doses but offered no time frame for the decision.</p><p>The Biden administration has been pushing boosters largely to counter any waning strength of vaccines and the contagious Delta variant. But many health experts have said there isn't sufficient evidence to offer boosters to most people, beyond those who have weakened immune systems because of their age or medical condition.</p><p>A large international clinical trial found that a single shot of J&amp;J's vaccine was about 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe cases of Covid-19.</p><p>J&amp;J said the vaccine has been 75% effective globally against severe and critical cases.</p><p>The company said there was no waning of protection against severe cases in the U.S. up to at least six months after vaccination with a single dose. Yet it said it has observed a decrease in protection against moderate to severe Covid-19 cases globally because of the emergence of coronavirus variants outside the U.S.</p><p>J&amp;J studied giving a second dose at varying time points. In one large study of more than 31,000 people, J&amp;J found that giving a second shot about two months after the first was about 75% effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19 cases, and was 100% effective against severe cases only.</p><p>In another, much smaller analysis involving only 17 study subjects, J&amp;J found that providing a booster dose six months after the first dose boosted levels of neutralizing antibodies against the virus to well above pre-booster levels.</p><p>\"I think the data is insufficient to say anything about a six-month interval,\" said advisory committee member Mark Sawyer, a professor of clinical pediatrics at University of California San Diego School of Medicine. \"I think, overall, the benefit outweighs the risk even though we have a paucity of data on some aspects of it.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
