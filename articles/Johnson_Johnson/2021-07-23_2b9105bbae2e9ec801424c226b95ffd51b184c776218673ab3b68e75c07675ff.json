  "title": "U.S. News: Advisory Panel Considers Boosters",
  "text": "<p>The ACIP panel, which advises the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, develops recommendations for use of vaccines generally in the U.S. The committee is composed of experts in infectious diseases, immunology and public health.</p><p>Its consideration of boosters came as evidence grows that Covid-19 vaccines are less effective among people with weakened immune systems than for the rest of the general population, increasing the risk of infection and severe disease.</p><p>About 2.7% of adults in the U.S. are considered immunocompromised, according to the CDC, including transplant recipients, some cancer survivors and people living with HIV. That makes them less responsive to vaccines, which require stimulation of the immune system to provide protection.</p><p>Transplant recipients, who often take a cocktail of powerful immunosuppressant drugs, are among the least likely to develop antibodies from the vaccines, according to doctors and several new studies.</p><p>In four studies, between a third and half of the subjects who had no antibody response after the first two doses of a messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccine ended up developing a response after the third, CDC staff said.</p><p>France and Israel are allowing extra doses for some immunocompromised people, while the U.K. is considering a similar measure.</p><p>The advisory committee can't recommend additional doses for specific groups of individuals, such as those who are immunocompromised, because of quirks in the Covid-19 vaccines' emergency authorization. The panel will have to wait either for the shots' full approval or for health regulators to amend the authorization, the CDC said.</p><p>Grace Lee, an ACIP panel member who is a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Stanford University, said there was sufficient data to suggest an additional dose would be helpful, after the regulatory clearance is given.</p><p>\"It seems to me that the issue is almost running away from us,\" said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University. \"These people want to be vaccinated. They're not vaccine hesitant, and it seems to me that we should promote that.\"</p><p>Separately, an ACIP panel work group said they continue to recommend the one-dose J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine even after the Food and Drug Administration last week warned of a possible link between the shot and a rare neurological disorder known as Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p><p>People with a history of Guillain-Barre, the work group said, can get any available Covid-19 shots, but should talk to their doctors about whether they should get one of the two messenger RNA vaccines made by Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, or by Moderna Inc.</p><p>Jose Romero, ACIP panel chair and the Arkansas Secretary of Health, said a one-dose shot is valuable in his state, where Delta-variant cases are surging. \"There are clearly individuals in my state that will not come back for a second dose.\"</p>",
