  "title": "The Science Behind Rahm's Covid-19 Deja Vu",
  "text": "<p>This week, the 26-year-old Spanish golfer's quest for Olympic gold was derailed once again by the same opponent: the Covid-19-causing coronavirus. Rahm tested positive on the third test he was required to take before traveling to Tokyo for the games.</p><p>The surreal sequence of events was made even more surprising by one other detail: Rahm had been vaccinated.</p><p>\"I would have loved to have been the first Spanish Olympic gold medalist in golf, but unfortunately destiny had other plans,\" he wrote on Twitter in Spanish and English. \"This is a great reminder for all of us that we're still in a pandemic.\"</p><p>It may also be a great reminder that breakthrough cases, or infections after being fully vaccinated, aren't all that rare, scientists say, especially with variants like Delta. Some research suggests that Delta is slightly better at evading currently available vaccines than other versions of the virus.</p><p>If his positive case is confirmed, Rahm's experience may be a preview of what's in store for the rest of the world -- and particularly the sports world -- as Covid remains a fact of life.</p><p>\"You're going to have this over and over again,\" said Stanley Perlman, a University of Iowa coronavirus researcher and a member on the panel advising the FDA about authorizing Covid-19 vaccines. \"This is a story more about being cautious and being sad for the golfer than it being any risk for the world.\"</p><p>Covid reinfections, like breakthrough cases, tend to be less severe. They can be prevented by the same mitigation strategies that have been scientifically shown to work for infections generally, like masking and ventilation. Vaccines currently authorized in the U.S. for Covid-19 are highly effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths, but they were not designed to totally prevent infections. Other highly effective vaccines, like those for measles, work similarly.</p><p>Researchers don't yet know for sure whether people who get Covid breakthrough cases are contagious, but some data suggests that they carry around less virus, which would lower their chances of spreading it to other people.</p><p>Dr. Perlman and others said that if indeed Rahm caught Covid again, it was unlikely he posed a real threat to others.</p><p>Rahm had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine before testing positive at the Memorial. But he was still within the two-week incubation period it takes for the vaccine to realize its full effects.</p><p>\"Two weeks is just when your antibody levels start going up,\" said Theodora Hatziioannou, a Rockefeller University virologist studying Covid-19 immunity. \"That's when you can detect them very, very nicely. But it's also not the peak. They continue to grow for a few weeks.\"</p>",
