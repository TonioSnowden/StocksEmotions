  "text": "<p>Breakout, formed in 2016, invested its $60 million first fund in startups such as Immusoft, a biotechnology company that genetically modifies B cells of the immune system to create therapeutics, and Checkerspot, which uses synthetic biology and chemistry to produce new biologically derived oils.</p><p>Technological advances are creating opportunities for venture investment in convergence startups, but so is rising corporate activity. Ten years ago, large companies showed interest in such approaches but didn't always have budgets set aside for engaging startups, Ms. Fishburne said.</p><p>That has changed. Immusoft, for example, in October disclosed a deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. to uncover cell therapies for rare neurometabolic disorders. Immusoft could earn more than $900 million from the collaboration.</p><p>\"There are more templates of successful partnerships now,\" Ms. Moore said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Organoid technology.

Initially, NextVivo intends to use it to develop immunotherapies for cancer.</p><p>NextVivo uses human cells to grow mini organs, or organoids, which are clusters of cells that replicate an organ or sample of disease tissue outside the body.</p><p>Because organoids faithfully represent biology inside patients, they can be used to test and develop disease treatments, according to NextVivo co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Margolin.</p><p>$300 Million</p><p>The amount cancer-detection startup Freenome Holdings Inc. raised for its Series D financing.</p><p>SoftBank Leads $300 Million Investment in Mental-Health Startup</p><p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 has led a $300 million venture investment in Cerebral Inc. that values the online mental-healthcare startup at $4.8 billion.

U.S. telemedicine startups through Oct. 18 this year have raised $13 billion in venture capital, up from $7.7 billion in all of 2020, according to market tracker PitchBook Data Inc.</p><p>Cerebral is one of several telemedicine companies offering mental-health services, with others including publicly traded Teladoc Health Inc. and Talkspace Inc. Despite industry growth, demand for digital mental healthcare outstrips supply, says Cerebral founder and Chief Executive Kyle Robertson.</p><p>Cerebral provides counseling and therapy for conditions including depression, anxiety, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and substance-use disorder, and also ships medications for their conditions to patients.</p><p>MTIP, a Healthtech Investor, Raises $250 Million for Its Second Fund</p><p>Swiss healthtech private-equity firm MTIP AG has collected $250 million for its second investment fund, with the goal of backing companies at the nexus of two expanding industry sectors, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports.
