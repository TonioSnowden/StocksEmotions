  "title": "J&J Talc Bankruptcy Case Moved to New Jersey From North Carolina; A new subsidiary put into chapter 11 last month will have its case moved to New Jersey where the consumer-products giant is based",
  "text": "<p>In his ruling, the judge said that New Jersey, where J&amp;J is based, is the \"superior jurisdiction\" for the chapter 11 case to unfold, given the large number of talc-related lawsuits and related insurance disputes already pending there.</p><p>The decision marks a setback for J&amp;J's strategy to weather the nearly 40,000 pending lawsuits alleging talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses, which J&amp;J denies. Judge Whitley on Wednesday agreed to pause litigation against J&amp;J and its affiliates for 60 days as the company and the injury lawyers suing it shift their dispute to New Jersey.</p><p>J&amp;J had steered the bankruptcy case to its preferred venue through a corporate restructuring that ultimately placed its talc liabilities in Charlotte, which has become a landing spot for large asbestos bankruptcies.</p><p>J&amp;J first shifted its talc-related liabilities and assets to a Texas subsidiary, using a state law that allows splitting corporate assets from liabilities through what are known as divisional mergers. The Texas subsidiary was subsequently converted into a North Carolina-based company—LTL Management LLC—shortly before filing for bankruptcy last month in Charlotte.</p><p>Such corporate restructuring has been used before in other asbestos-related bankruptcies filed in North Carolina. The strategy is currently being scrutinized in the U.S. Congress, which is considering a Democratic bill that would allow creditors to seek dismissal of a chapter 11 case if it was initiated after the type of restructuring J&amp;J performed.</p><p>Judge Whitley said last month he wasn't sure whether the LTL Management bankruptcy belonged in his courtroom or should be moved to either Delaware or New Jersey, where thousands of talcum-related injury lawsuits against J&amp;J have been litigated for years. Law firms representing personal-injury claimants supported moving the case to New Jersey.</p><p>LTL Management Chief Legal Officer John Kim said that while the company believes North Carolina was the appropriate venue for the chapter 11, \"we will continue to work with all parties to seek an efficient and equitable resolution.\"</p><p>The J&amp;J subsidiary was able to seek protection in Charlotte because of federal bankruptcy law's lenient venue-selection rules that allow troubled companies to file for chapter 11 protection in courts located far away from their headquarters. Congress is currently considering bipartisan legislation that would make rules governing where a company can file for chapter 11 more restrictive.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Talc Bankruptcy Case Moved to New Jersey From North Carolina</p>",
