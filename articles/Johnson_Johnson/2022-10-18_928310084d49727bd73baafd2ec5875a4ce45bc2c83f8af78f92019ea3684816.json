  "text": "<p>J&amp;J is likely to make modest cuts to its workforce both as a result of economic pressures and in connection with the planned separation of its consumer-health business next year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview. The consumer business, which sells Tylenol and Band-Aids, will be called Kenvue.</p><p>\"We're not immune to some of the economic pressures that are out there just like many companies are facing in many industries,\" Mr. Wolk said in the interview. \"So we're taking this opportunity to really look at the resources, how we deploy them.\"</p><p>Mr. Wolk said various job functions would be affected, though he didn't provide a number and said it wouldn't be a major restructuring. The company will continue to invest in research and development and hire new scientists, he said.</p><p>For the third quarter, J&amp;J posted a quarterly profit of $4.46 billion, or $1.68 a share, up from $3.67 billion, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time costs, J&amp;J's per-share profit was $2.55. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting an adjusted profit of $2.48, according to FactSet.</p><p>Overall sales rose a little less than 2% to $23.79 billion. The company estimates that currency adjustments lowered worldwide sales growth by 6.2%. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting quarterly sales of $23.36 billion.</p><p>J&amp;J's biggest unit, pharmaceuticals, posted sales of $13.2 billion, up 2.6% from a year earlier, helped by strong growth in sales of cancer drugs.</p><p>J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine generated global sales of $489 million, down 2.7%.</p><p>The company's MedTech unit, which includes heart devices and knee replacement parts, had sales of $6.78 billion, up 2.1%. Mr. Wolk said hospital procedure volumes are returning to normal after being disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>J&amp;J's consumer-health sales declined slightly to $3.8 billion, as currency effects offset underlying growth in over-the-counter medicines and skin-care products. Mr. Wolk said the company increased some consumer-product prices in the second quarter, which helped third-quarter sales.</p><p>J&amp;J's cost of products sold, which includes labor, rose by 7.7% from a year earlier.</p><p>The company cut its full-year sales guidance to a range of $93 billion to $93.5 billion, excluding sales from the company's Covid-19 vaccine. In July, J&amp;J guided for full-year sales of $93.3 billion to $94.3 billion.</p><p>J&amp;J narrowed its guidance for full-year operational sales, which also excludes the impact of currency-fluctuations, to a range of $97.5 billion to $98 billion.</p><p>Shares of J&amp;J rose more than 2% in premarket trading to $170.19. So far this year, the stock was down almost 3% as of Monday's closing price.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at Peter.Loftus@wsj.com and Will Feuer at Will.Feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Likely to Make Some Cuts to Workforce Despite Higher Sales, Profit</p>",
