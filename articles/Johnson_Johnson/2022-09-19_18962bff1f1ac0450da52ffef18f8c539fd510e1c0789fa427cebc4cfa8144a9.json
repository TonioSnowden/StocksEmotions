  "title": "Some People Are Finally Getting Their First Dose of a Covid-19 Vaccine; Job mandates and easing safety concerns are among the reasons newly vaccinated people say they got their shots",
  "text": "<p>All together, the seven-day average for adults getting first shots each day ranged between roughly 15,000 and 18,000 in late August, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The data can overestimate first-shot recipients, because there are times where the agency can't link follow-up shots, including boosters, to people who received an initial series. The same effect can lead to an undercount of booster shots, according to the CDC.</p><p>People who recently got the first jab cited a range of reasons. Some said they were ordered to do so, such as to start a new job or travel for a vacation. Others waited until a vaccine using a more-traditional technology, instead of the newer mRNA versions, became available. Some went ahead after getting sick with Covid-19, or after a family member vouched that the shots worked.</p><p>Many newly vaccinated people said learning about the shots had erased some of the concerns that had been triggered by misinformation they had heard from friends or seen online.</p><p>\"To tell you the truth, I kind of felt stupid that I waited so long,\" said Linda Ford, who got vaccinated in June ahead of a trip to Niagara Falls that required the shots.</p><p>Before then, Ms. Ford, a 63-year-old from West Helena, Ark., said she had held off due to concerns about the safety of the shots fueled by her readings online. She got Covid-19 twice, despite wearing a mask and limiting her time in public to protect against infection.</p><p>Health authorities have continued to push people to get vaccinated this late in the pandemic even if they have had Covid-19, to protect themselves as well as vulnerable family members.</p><p>The most widely used shots—a messenger RNA vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, and another from Moderna Inc.—involve two doses several weeks apart. A vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson consists of one dose.</p><p>Nearly 80% of the U.S. population has received one dose of a Covid-19 shot, and 68% is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. </p><p>Nearly 80% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

About 80% of unvaccinated adults in the U.S. who were surveyed in July said they definitely won't get a shot, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>The rest could end up getting shots at clinics or community events intended to encourage boosting, according to doctors, pharmacists and others who have been administering the shots.</p><p>There isn't published data yet on why people who were hesitant about getting a Covid-19 vaccine changed their minds. Researchers who have studied other vaccination campaigns said acceptance generally improves over time.</p><p>Christian Ketel, a community health nurse who manages the Vanderbilt Mobile Vaccine Program in Tennessee, said holding clinics regularly at the same locations—sometimes 20 times at the same church or housing community—led hesitant people to trust his team.</p><p>Holdouts also were swayed, he said, after speaking with friends and family who vouched for the safety of the shots. His team, which focuses on refugees and people who have low income or are homeless, administers about 20 to 30 first doses a month.</p><p>\"They've finally been able to understand their risk of getting significantly sick outweighs their apprehensions of getting vaccinated. It just takes some people a little bit longer to get to that point,\" Mr. Ketel said.</p><p>Some people may decide to get a Covid-19 shot as public debate over whether they are needed recedes and political polarization over vaccination dies out in some parts of the country, said Dr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.</p><p>Covid-19 vaccine acceptance has broken along political lines, surveys have found. In the Kaiser Family Foundation's July survey, some 6% of self-reported Democrats said they definitely wouldn't get vaccinated, compared with 29% of self-reported Republicans.</p><p>Other holdouts might simply find the time to get vaccinated, according to Dr. Omer. \"They're not necessarily aggressively antivaccine but it's just that it's not a priority,\" he said.</p><p>Robert Johnson, of Oklahoma City, said he delayed getting vaccinated because of worries that potential side effects could jeopardize his health, a concern as a single father raising three children. After talking with his doctor at an Oak Street Health Inc. clinic, he got vaccinated in June to be able to start working as an aide at a behavioral health clinic.</p><p>\"It took some time to get comfortable with it,\" said Mr. Johnson, 46 years old.</p><p>Amanda Wood, 45, a nurse practitioner in central Pennsylvania, said she had received a religious exemption to her former employer's vaccine requirement because of her concerns with how the vaccines were developed.</p><p>She was especially reluctant to get an mRNA vaccine, she said, because it uses a newer technology.</p><p>A vaccine from Novavax Inc. uses a different, older technology. A few weeks after it became available, she drove more than two hours in early August to get the shot. \"I just wanted to wait it out,\" she said.</p><p>—Jon Kamp contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
