  "title": "Business News:  Talc Cases Shift  To Charlotte, N.C.  ----  By Jonathan Randles",
  "text": "<p>    Johnson &amp; Johnson used venue-selection rules of U.S. bankruptcy law to push tens of thousands of talc-related cancer claims to its bankruptcy court of choice, roughly 600 miles south of the company's New Jersey headquarters. </p><p>   The New Brunswick, N.J., consumer-goods giant follows other companies that have filed chapter 11 cases in venues far from their headquarters to weather lawsuits over harmful products or other alleged wrongdoing. Known as forum-shopping, the strategy of steering chapter 11 cases to specific courts feeds the perception that bankruptcy rules tilt the playing field, according to some scholars. </p><p>   J&amp;J formed a new Texas subsidiary to carry its talc liabilities, then converted that entity to a North Carolina-based company days before it filed for bankruptcy. The chapter 11 filing last week effectively shifts to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Charlotte, N.C., the fate of nearly 40,000 pending lawsuits alleging talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses. </p><p>   Congress is considering making forum-selection rules more restrictive. The rules have long been flexible in allowing companies their preferred location for filing for bankruptcy protection. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and John Cornyn (R., Texas) reintroduced legislation last month that would require corporations or wealthy individuals to file chapter 11 either in their home state or where they have significant assets. </p><p>   Congressional Democrats criticized J&amp;J's decision to put its talc claims into chapter 11, describing it as an abuse of the bankruptcy system. </p><p>   J&amp;J has said bankruptcy provides a forum to fairly compensate claimants, and likely quicker than through the traditional trial system. The company has defeated some suits, lost others and maintained that its baby powder is safe. </p><p>   J&amp;J's subsidiary in chapter 11, LTL Management LLC, said in a Monday filing that J&amp;J should be protected from ongoing talc lawsuits even though it isn't in bankruptcy itself. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Wednesday. </p><p>   J&amp;J's subsidiary has accused personal-injury lawyers of forum-shopping in talc cases, saying in court papers last week that law firms strategically placed ads in markets where complaints have been brought, including Missouri. </p><p>   J&amp;J's defense costs for talc lawsuits have totaled about $1 billion, with settlements and verdicts related to talc costing another $3.5 billion, according to court papers. </p><p></p>",
