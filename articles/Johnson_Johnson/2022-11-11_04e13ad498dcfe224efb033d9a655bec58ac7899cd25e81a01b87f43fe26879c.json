  "title": "Canada Confronts Shortage of Children's Pain Relievers; Makers of Tylenol and Advil for children can't keep up with demand during unusual flu season, wave of RSV",
  "text": "<p>\"Supply of these products has been limited primarily due to unprecedented demand since the summer,\" said André Gagnon, a spokesman for the Canadian health department, in an email.</p><p>No other countries are experiencing similar shortages, according to Mark Parrish, president of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers, a trade association with members from 19 countries. In Canada, supply chain slowdowns have been exacerbated by increased demand for the medicines during unseasonable times, which has hobbled manufacturers' efforts to keep up, say regulators. Further complicating Canada's situation for imports are regulations that require medicine labels to be written in English and in French.</p><p>According to Canadian regulators and healthcare professionals, demand increased amid an unusual uptick in cases of the flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, during the summer. The viruses typically circulate in the fall and winter months, but they proliferated in the spring and summer this year as children began resuming normal routines after spending months in covid lockdowns, say pediatricians and hospital administrators.</p><p>Manufacturers in this country have been unable to keep up. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the maker of Children's Tylenol, said it has boosted production at its manufacturing plant in Guelph, Ontario, located 60 miles west of Toronto.</p><p>\"Our Canadian manufacturing site is running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and products are shipping across the country every day,\" a company spokeswoman said in an email.</p><p>The shortage is forcing parents to choose expensive alternatives to relieve their sick children.</p><p>Clare Tattersall, a real-estate agent who lives on Toronto's west side said she couldn't find any pain relievers at local drugstores after her 9-year-old daughter came down with a fever last month. Her doctor suggested she go to a specialized pharmacy that could compound the drugs there and make her a version of the medication.</p><p>The option cost her 40 Canadian dollars, equivalent to $30, compared with the retail price of Children's Tylenol of about $10.50, according to prices listed at a Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy in Toronto. \"It's very stressful to be out of pocket that much money to combat just one fever,\" she said. \"We're already watching our expenses.\"</p><p>A search of five pharmacies in Toronto, Canada's largest city, turned up only one bottle of Children's Tylenol, kept behind the counter. Pharmacist Tilbin Sebastian said many customers have been coming in for the medication, and most have been turned away. When supplies arrive, they are snapped up quickly. \"It's been going on for weeks,\" he said.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said officials at the health ministry are working with drug manufacturers, pharmacists and the country's provinces—which have jurisdiction over delivering healthcare—to ensure children can get access to medication.</p><p>\"We recognize that the pandemic has led to challenges to our supply chains around the world, which is why we're continuing to work with partners to ensure that we can get the things that parents need to take care of their kids,\" Mr. Trudeau told lawmakers Nov. 2, answering questions from three Conservative Party lawmakers on the shortage.</p><p>Regulations mandating that all medications sold in the country be labeled in both French and English make it more difficult for Canada to import supply from other countries that don't have those requirements.</p><p>Health Canada has said it is looking into relaxing the rules to deal with the shortage.</p><p>Heavy demand has spurred panic buying as reports of the shortage circulate, said Joelle Walker, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Pharmacists Association.</p><p>\"News spreads, and there's a very natural tendency to want to protect the kids,\" said Ms. Walker. She said that pharmaceutical companies had increased production by as much as 40% over normal levels, but demand has increased more as parents worry about getting access to medicine.</p><p>The shortage is coming as the traditional flu season gets going. Hospitals across Canada are struggling to manage an influx of children who have come down with the flu or RSV, said Emily Gruenwoldt, president of the Children's Healthcare Canada trade association.</p><p>The wave has overwhelmed children's wards in Montreal, and Ottawa, where hospitals are being forced to take steps like putting two or more children in single rooms or transfer others to adult wards in local hospitals, she said.</p><p>\"This is the biggest challenge the children's healthcare system is facing in Canada,\" said Ms. Gruenwoldt. \"The viruses are putting enormous strain on our system.\"</p><p>The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ottawa was at 186% of capacity, while Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal was at 131% capacity as of Thursday, according to spokespeople for those hospitals.</p><p>Melanie Paradis, a former strategist for the Conservative Party who now runs her own public relations firm, was visiting her parents in Niagara Falls last month when her 16-month-old son got sick. Unable to find any medicine in local drugstores, she crossed the border into Lewiston, N.Y., and expected to find a similar situation as she did back home. Instead, she found the shelves there fully stocked.</p><p>\"I did not expect it to be as easy as it was,\" said Ms. Paradis.</p><p>Write to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com</p><p>Canada Confronts Shortage of Children's Pain Relievers</p>",
