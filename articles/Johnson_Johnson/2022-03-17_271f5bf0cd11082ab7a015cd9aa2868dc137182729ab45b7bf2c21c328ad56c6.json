  "text": "<p>\"If you have companies in your districts who financed the Russian military machine . . . You should put pressure,\" he said. \"I am asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine.\"</p><p>Many Western companies have paused their operations in the Russian market, with some citing dismay at Moscow's aggression and others flagging the logistical challenges of operating in a country hit by sanctions. A handful of businesses have signaled intentions to leave altogether.</p><p>Other companies are staying. Some have cited humanitarian reasons, including providing essential goods like food or medicine. Others say their hands are tied by joint venture or franchise agreements. Then there are companies Russian prosecutors have warned of asset seizures if they withdraw from the country, as well as threats that employees could be arrested.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky's comments to U.S. lawmakers echo similar remarks he made to Canada's Parliament a day before, saying that more companies could be forced to leave Russia.</p><p>In a separate address Tuesday, Mr. Zelensky took aim at specific companies that he said hadn't left the Russian market. He named Nestle SA, Mondelez International Inc. and Unilever PLC, among \"other giants of the food industry,\" as well as French lender Societe Generale SA.</p><p>The Ukrainian president also mentioned South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Co., pharmaceutical companies Sanofi SA and Johnson &amp; Johnson, along with chemicals giant BASF SE and Bayer AG, the agricultural and drugs supplier.</p><p>Food companies including Nestle and Unilever said previously that they suspended advertising in Russia, along with imports and exports of all but essential food and other products. Both are continuing local production of some products to sell in Russia.</p><p>Unilever and Mondelez didn't respond to requests for comment, while Nestle declined to comment beyond previously issued statements.</p><p>Drug companies have broadly continued supplying medicines to Russia, saying that they feel an ethical obligation to do so, while publicly condemning the invasion.</p><p>Some, though, have scaled back certain activities. For instance, Sanofi and Bayer said Monday that they would halt all marketing in Russia and spending not directly related to supplying their products to the country. Bayer also threatened to halt its crop supplies to Russia next year unless Moscow stops its attacks.</p><p>Sanofi and Bayer declined to comment beyond their earlier statements. A spokeswoman for J&amp;J said the company is responsible to its patients and consumers world-wide, and remains committed to providing essential health products to those in need in Ukraine, Russia and the region.</p><p>BASF didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Financial firms have said they have a duty to support their clients. In response to Mr. Zelensky's remarks, a spokesman for SocGen said the bank is complying with all laws and regulations, and \"conducting its business in Russia with the utmost caution and selectivity.\"</p><p>Samsung shareholders asked the TVs-to-cellphones maker during its annual meeting Wednesday whether it would consider pulling out of Russia. Co-CEO Han Jong-Hee said the company was looking carefully at the state of economic sanctions against Russia and reiterated that product shipments there had been suspended. Samsung didn't directly address Mr. Zelensky's remarks. Rival LG didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>",
