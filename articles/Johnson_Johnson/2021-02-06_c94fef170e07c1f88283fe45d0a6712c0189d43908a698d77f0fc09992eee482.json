  "title": "World News: Shot Works Against U.K. Variant --- AstraZeneca vaccine is 75% effective against new Covid-19 version, a study finds",
  "text": "<p>Preliminary studies from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. found their Covid-19 shots offer protection against new virus variants that have contributed to a fresh surge in cases in the U.K., Europe, South Africa and elsewhere.</p><p>Vaccine makers are nevertheless readying new shots that zero in on the new variants more precisely, underlining how mutations in the virus risk morphing the year-old pandemic into a long-running cat-and-mouse game between scientists and a shifting enemy.</p><p>The study looked at the AstraZeneca vaccine's effectiveness against a new variant first identified in the U.K. last year. The variant has now displaced older strains to become the dominant version of the virus in Britain and is spreading in many other countries.</p><p>Preliminary estimates suggest the variant from the U.K. is 50% to 70% more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus. U.K. scientists said early data suggests it also could be deadlier.</p><p>Researchers examined nose and throat swabs from about 256 participants in a continuing clinical trial of the vaccine in the U.K. who tested positive for Covid-19. Genetic sequencing allowed them to identify which participants were infected with the new variant and which had an older version. A little under a third had the new variant.</p><p>By testing antibody levels and other markers of immune system activity against the virus, the researchers found the vaccine triggered an effective immune response against the new variant in 75% of cases that showed symptoms of infection, and in about two-thirds of cases if those that didn't show symptoms were also included.</p><p>The small-scale study showed the vaccine works slightly better against older, more established versions of the virus. For those with the older strain, the vaccine was effective in 84% of symptomatic cases and 81% of all cases.</p><p>The researchers reported sharply differing antibody responses among the two groups, saying certain types of antibodies induced by the vaccine were up to one-ninth as effective at neutralizing the new variant as the old. Overall protection was similar, however, suggesting other parts of the immune system are playing a key role.</p><p>Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, said it isn't entirely clear which biological mechanisms are most important. It might be infection-fighting T-cells or other types of antibodies, he said.</p><p>Almost 120 million doses of vaccine have been administered world-wide, according to figures compiled by Oxford's Our World in Data project. Rollouts have been patchy, with some countries such as Israel and the U.K. moving rapidly to inoculate their most at-risk citizens.</p><p>Vaccine makers say the technology behind Covid-19 vaccines should allow them to swiftly retool their production lines to produce shots targeted more precisely at new and emerging variants.</p><p>Some studies have suggested a variant first identified in South Africa might be less susceptible to existing vaccines than the U.K. variant. Companies including Moderna, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech SE, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax Inc. are designing new vaccines to specifically target the South African variant.</p><p>Babak Javid, associate professor of infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, said small differences in how vaccines perform against new variants compared with established versions isn't a major concern provided those vaccinated are protected against severe illness and hospitalization. That will be critical to determining when countries relax lockdowns and other public-health restrictions, he said.</p>",
