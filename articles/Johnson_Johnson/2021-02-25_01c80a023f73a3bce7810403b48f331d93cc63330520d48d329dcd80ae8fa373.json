  "text": "<p>Moderna expects to bring in $18.4bn this year from deals it has signed for its Covid-19 vaccine, as the pandemic transforms the fortunes of the loss-making start-up.</p> <p>The Boston-based biotech's coronavirus vaccine revenue forecast is far higher than the $11.2bn analysts had predicted for 2021, as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ab138-401d-40ff-824f-f6879704f10e\">the $15bn</a> that Pfizer said it expected when it reported earnings this month.</p> <p>Moderna said this number could rise because it was in discussions with governments about more vaccine orders for 2021 and 2022, as well as Covax, the vaccination programme for the developing world. </p> <p>Shares rose more than 8 per cent to $157.12 in early trading in New York.&#xa0;</p> <p>Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said 2021 would be an “inflection year” for the company. </p> <p>“We previously believed that mRNA would lead to approved medicines, and we were limited in our ambitions by the need for regular capital raises and keeping several years of cash to manage financing risk,” he said. “We now know that mRNA vaccines can be highly efficacious and authorised for use, and we are a cash-flow generating commercial company.”</p> <p>Bancel said Moderna was seeing demand rise because its vaccine's 94.5 per cent efficacy rate is significantly higher than Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. </p> <p>“Many governments have been telling us that they now see two classes of Covid-19 vaccine based on efficacy and they would like more of our vaccine based on its high efficacy,” he said. He added that when consumers start to have choice of which vaccines to take, Moderna was also likely to benefit. </p> <p>The forecasts come after Moderna <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a14a91b1-8ced-45ef-b679-1f2bada4f50b\">became the first vaccine maker</a> to unveil a shot tailored to the 501.V2 variant, which was first discovered in South Africa. The company has sent this vaccine to the US National Institutes of Health for use in a trial. </p> <p>It is also giving a half-dose of the existing vaccine to previous trial participants in hopes of boosting their immunity against the variants, and developing a multivalent vaccine which could target more than one strain. </p> <p>Tal Zaks, the Moderna chief medical officer who is set to leave his job later this year, said its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5d03854-39bb-48cd-9a01-5fb2a0dfbba8\">mRNA technology</a> would probably work better as a booster than the adenovirus vectors used by Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. </p> <p>He said it would be “challenging” for those vaccines to get an equally good immune response since the body would recognise the inactivated virus carrying the genetic sequence, whereas the body does not see the lipid nanoparticles used to deliver the mRNA<strong>. </strong></p> <p>In the fourth quarter, Moderna reported revenue of $571m, from US government grants and sales of its Covid-19 vaccine after it became available in the US in December. The company's net loss of $272m was wider than the $123m for the same period the year before.</p> <p>Unlike rival BioNTech, which has teamed up with Pfizer for its inoculation, Moderna is not sharing the proceeds with a Big Pharma partner. Moderna is building a global commercial network, opening eight country subsidiaries last year, and units in Australia, Japan and South Korea this year. </p> <p>Moderna's shot also costs more than the BioNTech/Pfizer one. Prices range from about $25 a dose for the US government, which has funded its vaccine development, to between $32 and $37 a dose for other customers depending on the size of orders. BioNTech/Pfizer is priced at about $19 a dose. Both vaccines require two doses. </p> <p>Moderna also raised its minimum production for the year to 700m doses, up from 600m, while keeping the upper end of its target at 1bn. The company is expanding manufacturing for next year, to produce up to 1.4bn doses — and possibly more if it ends up giving half-doses as boosters. It expects $350m to $400m in capital expenditure in 2021. </p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in New York 2021 'Moderna expects $18.4bn from Covid vaccine deals this year' FT.com 25 February.
