  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Backs Off Covid Vaccine Sales Guidance, Citing Supply Surplus; In its consumer business, sales were hampered by supply constraints that mostly held back the company's skin-care and beauty-product lines",
  "text": "<p>The healthcare-products company said Tuesday that Covid-19 shots helped lift overall sales in its most recent quarter. Johnson &amp; Johnson sold $457 million of the vaccine in its most recent quarter, with international buyers accounting for most of those sales. In the same period a year earlier, shortly after the shot had been authorized in the U.S., the company's Covid-19 vaccine sales were $100 million, exclusively in the U.S. In the previous quarter, the company's global Covid-19 vaccine sales came in at $1.62 billion.</p><p>J&amp;J had previously predicted Covid-19 vaccine sales of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for full-year 2022. J&amp;J may still continue to generate vaccine sales, but a surplus of doses and uncertain demand make it tougher to predict, J&amp;J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview Tuesday. </p><p>\"The demand outlook has become cloudy, I think, in the first quarter,\" Mr. Wolk said.</p><p>Other companies, too, are trying to predict future demand for products that became essential pandemic-fighting tools. Abbott Laboratories ramped up production early this year of the BinaxNow Covid-19 tests that became the most familiar brand to many consumers. Testing rates have since dropped from the huge peak driven by the Omicron variant. 3M Co. said in January that it expected demand for its N95 masks to fall as the year progresses.</p><p>J&amp;J and other vaccine makers have made many doses of Covid-19 vaccine, but there are limitations in the logistics of getting those shots to people in developing countries, leading to a backlog, Mr. Wolk said. He also cited vaccine hesitancy, particularly as the Omicron surge has receded, as a reason that demand has cooled.</p><p>The J&amp;J shot is one of three for Covid-19 authorized or approved in the U.S., but its use in the U.S. has lagged behind that of vaccines developed by other manufacturers. U.S. health regulators briefly paused the use of the vaccine in April of last year as they investigated rare blood-clotting conditions.</p><p>Moderna Inc., which makes one of the leading Covid-19 vaccines, has said that some low- and middle-income countries have declined deliveries of doses because of on-the-ground logistical challenges and vaccine hesitancy. </p><p>Still, Moderna and Pfizer Inc., which sells another leading Covid-19 vaccine with BioNTech SE, have predicted much higher sales of their respective shots for full-year 2022 than J&amp;J was predicting before it suspended its guidance. Concerns surrounding the safety and efficacy of J&amp;J's vaccine, as well as manufacturing problems that limited supply last year, have contributed to lower usage. J&amp;J has sold its vaccine at a not-for-profit price. </p><p>J&amp;J cut its full-year sales guidance from between $95.9 billion and $96.9 billion to between $94.8 billion and $95.8 billion. The company also slashed its adjusted earnings outlook from between $10.40 a share and $10.60 a share to between $10.15 a share and $10.35 a share.</p><p>Apart from the vaccine, Mr. Wolk said the new forecast reflects an expectation that negative currency-exchange trends could reduce full-year sales by $2.5 billion and cut adjusted earnings by 45 cents a share.</p><p>About 16.9 million Americans have been vaccinated with J&amp;J's single-dose shot, a fraction of the number who have been immunized with shots made by Moderna and by Pfizer and BioNTech, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those companies' booster shots have also seen far more use in the U.S. than J&amp;J's.</p><p>Overall, higher sales from J&amp;J's pharmaceuticals and medical-devices segments contributed to a 5% rise in revenue in the first quarter. Sales in the consumer business fell slightly from a year earlier.</p><p>In the first quarter, J&amp;J posted overall sales of $23.43 billion, compared with $22.32 billion a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting quarterly sales of $23.62 billion.</p><p>Profit was $5.15 billion, or $1.93 a share, down from $6.19 billion, or $2.32 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, J&amp;J's per-share profit was $2.67. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting an adjusted profit of $2.58, according to FactSet.</p><p>In the consumer business, sales declined 1.5% to $3.59 billion, hampered by supply constraints that mostly held back the company's skin-care and beauty products. Consumer-health profit margins also were hurt by commodity inflation. The segment's adjusted operational sales, which exclude the impact of divestitures and translational currency, rose 1.6%, driven by sales of over-the-counter products, including Tylenol, Motrin and Imodium.</p><p>Pharmaceutical  sales rose 6.3% to $12.87 billion, helped by sales of the company's Covid-19 vaccine, as well as other products, including Darzalex, a treatment of multiple myeloma, and Stelara, a treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as other products.</p><p>Sales from J&amp;J's medical-device unit rose 5.9% to $6.97 billion, helped by growth in contact lenses and artificial-knee replacements. Deferrals in elective procedures as a result of pandemic restrictions in certain regions have hurt device sales, including more recently in China as Covid-19 cases have surged, J&amp;J said.</p><p>The results come as the company prepares to separate its consumer-health division into a standalone business, leaving J&amp;J with its prescription-drug and medical-device units. That split will likely come in 2023, J&amp;J said.</p><p>J&amp;J has suspended sales of personal-care products in Russia in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine, but it has continued to supply essential medicines and devices there. The company also suspended advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. Mr. Wolk said sales in the region are about 1% of J&amp;J's overall business.</p><p>J&amp;J shares rose 3.5% to $183.83 in midday trading.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com and Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Backs Off Covid Vaccine Sales Guidance, Citing Supply Surplus</p>",
