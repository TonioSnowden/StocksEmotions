  "title": "Business News:  J&J Sales Rise Despite  Some Pandemic Pains  ----  By Matt Grossman and Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson finished 2021 with its strongest quarter to date for Covid-19 vaccine sales, contributing to year-over-year revenue growth across the company as it prepares to separate its consumer-health division. </p><p>   But some parts of J&amp;J's sprawling business, including medical devices and consumer products, felt pandemic-related effects: a deferral of elective surgeries during the Omicron virus variant wave and supply-chain constraints. </p><p>   The surge in Omicron caseloads, coupled with hospital staffing shortages, put off procedures that use J&amp;J devices like artificial joints, J&amp;J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview Tuesday. </p><p>   Supply constraints hit J&amp;J's consumer-health business, particularly skin-care products. Mr. Wolk said it was difficult to secure some raw materials, which limited the availability of certain products. </p><p>   Joaquin Duato, on his first earnings conference call since taking the CEO job on Jan. 3. said he expects the company to be more active in pursuing acquisitions that will bolster the pharmaceutical and medical-device units. </p><p>   In the latest quarter, J&amp;J sold $1.62 billion of its Covid-19 vaccine, with international buyers accounting for most of those sales. Total 2021 sales of the shot were $2.39 billion. </p><p>   In the fourth quarter, J&amp;J posted sales of $24.8 billion, up from $22.48 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to $4.74 billion from $1.74 billion. </p><p></p>",
