  "title": "U.S. News: Biden Urged to Delay Booster Push",
  "text": "<p>One official said the process for Pfizer remains on track, but Moderna and J&amp;J are likely to be pushed back beyond the week of Sept. 20. Last month, the Biden administration said people who had been vaccinated for eight months or longer should get a booster starting Sept. 20.</p><p>The White House said it is awaiting a full review, clearance by the FDA and a recommendation by the CDC's expert advisory panel.</p><p>\"We always said we would follow the science, and this is all part of a process that is now under way,\" said Chris Meagher, a White House spokesman. \"When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation's top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus.\"</p><p>The New York Times earlier reported the recommendation.</p><p>Asked this past week about concerns the booster campaign was premature, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, \"This was a recommendation made by our nation's leading health experts based on mounds and mounds of data.\"</p><p>The Biden administration has sought boosters to counter contagious variants and correct signs of waning immunity among the vaccinated, though evidence supporting the need for an extra dose, at least in the general public, isn't conclusive.</p><p>Federal health officials told the White House on Thursday they may not be able by Sept. 20 to make a decision clearing boosters for vaccines other than the one from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE.</p><p>The initial Pfizer campaign, if it does start the week of Sept. 20, also might need to be limited to higher risk groups such as nursing-home residents, healthcare workers and those over 65, the people said.</p><p>A Pfizer spokeswoman directed questions on the Biden administration's booster discussions to the government. J&amp;J said it is engaging with the FDA and CDC regarding boosters. Moderna didn't respond to a request for comment, but said on Twitter that it had completed its booster application to the FDA.</p><p>One issue stalling the discussions, one of the people said, is trying to figure out whether the Moderna vaccine booster should be a 50-microgram dose or the 100-microgram dose used for the first two shots. Boosters are authorized for immunocompromised people who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
