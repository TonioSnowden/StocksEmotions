  "title": "Judge Questions Decisive Vote on J&J Talc Supplier's Bankruptcy Plan; A lawyer for asbestos-injury victims initially opposed Imerys Talc America's bankruptcy plan, then changed roughly 15,700 votes to support it",
  "text": "<p>The healthcare giant has been opposing the Imerys plan, which would resolve the former supplier's liability for thousands of lawsuits linking the talc in J&amp;J's baby powder products to ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses.</p><p>The voting dispute centers on Thomas Bevan, an asbestos plaintiffs' lawyer who keeps a client database in asbestos-related bankruptcy cases. Mr. Bevan allegedly cast the decisive ballots on his clients' behalf in favor of the Imerys plan, switching the votes after initially rejecting the plan. Without his vote, the Imerys plan would lack sufficient support from personal injury claimants to qualify for court approval, according to J&amp;J's court filings.</p><p>Mr. Bevan testified Monday that he originally rejected the proposed plan on behalf of clients because he was concerned that votes in its favor could hurt recoveries in another talc-related bankruptcy.</p><p>Mr. Bevan testified that no quid pro quo was involved in his changing the votes and that he did so after his concerns about the bankruptcy plan were addressed.</p><p>Judge Silverstein deferred ruling on J&amp;J's request to toss out those votes but questioned what proof she had that clients of Mr. Bevan had exposure to Imerys talc products.</p><p>The judge concluded that Mr. Bevan had made no effort to cull from the client database those individuals who had a good-faith basis to believe they were exposed to Imerys products and therefore had valid claims. The judge also said she was concerned about some specific claims that were filed, including one on behalf of a client who had an earlier injury case dismissed.</p><p>\"I'm not sure that based on the testimony I heard that all of Mr. Bevan's clients should have a claim that gets to vote,\" Judge Silverstein said. \"It's somewhat troubling to think somebody can take a database of 15,000 clients who they file claims on in every asbestos case and then file them in the talc case.\"</p><p>Mr. Bevan said in an interview Tuesday that all of his clients voting for the Imerys plan had exposure to the company's products.</p><p>By the time Imerys filed for bankruptcy in 2019, it was swamped by roughly 13,800 claims tied to ovarian cancer and 850 related to mesothelioma. J&amp;J, also named in mass litigation over talc, has said the bankruptcy plan allowed cancer victims to set the amount of their damages without opposition, setting a precedent for collecting the rest of the money from J&amp;J.</p><p>J&amp;J has said that few of Mr. Bevan's clients would be eligible for recoveries under the Imerys plan because most haven't been diagnosed with ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, the illnesses eligible for compensation.</p><p>Ronit Berkovich, a lawyer for J&amp;J, said that Mr. Bevan's decision to switch his votes to back the Imerys plan made him the \"hero of the day\" to other plaintiffs' lawyers. Injury claimants supporting the Imerys plan are counting on J&amp;J to fund much of their compensation, based on its alleged obligation to reimburse its supplier for injury claims stemming from talc. J&amp;J has denied it owes any such obligations to Imerys or its creditors under the supply contracts between the two companies.</p><p>Ms. Berkovich said that allowing Mr. Bevan's votes in favor of the Imerys plan despite \"glaring red flags\" would disenfranchise other creditors by allowing individuals with weak claims a say.</p><p>The judge asked Tuesday whether a person who bought J&amp;J talc powder decades ago is enough to deserve a vote on the Imerys plan. It is when coupled with an injury, said Mr. Bevan's lawyer, Michael Joyce, who said his client filed the master ballot in good faith</p><p>Kimberly Posin, a lawyer for Imerys, said it is common to rely on representations made by plaintiffs' lawyers in mass tort cases. Those objecting to the votes are simply casting aspersions on the plaintiffs' lawyers, she said.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
