  "title": "U.S. News: Shots Protect Even When Side Effects Are Absent, Doctors Say",
  "text": "<p>That message may lead some people to infer that the absence of side effects indicates that vaccination isn't causing the body to build immunity to the virus. Yet infectious-disease doctors say most people get protection from the vaccines, even if they don't experience side effects.</p><p>\"I don't think someone should correlate the extent of their reactions to the vaccine with protection from infection,\" said H. Cody Meissner, chief of the pediatric infectious diseases division at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. \"We know that people who don't respond to a vaccine in terms of the side effects still are well protected. The vaccines work even if you don't have fatigue and headache and fever and muscle pain and joint pain.\"</p><p>Experts say more research is needed to establish what vaccine-related side effects, or their absence, tell us about the strength of people's immune responses.</p><p>A small study conducted recently by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania found that people who had more robust side effects after receiving either of the two leading vaccines in the U.S. -- from Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. -- had slightly higher antibody levels than those who had less robust side effects. Yet all people getting the vaccine in the study had good immune responses, said study co-author E. John Wherry, director of the Penn Institute for Immunology.</p><p>The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use RNA-based technology and can cause similar side effects. Ranging from injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, in addition to fever and chills, these typically arise within a day of vaccination and resolve within a couple of days.</p><p>The vaccines were at least 94% effective at protecting against Covid-19 in separate, large clinical trials that started last year.</p><p>A Pfizer spokeswoman said side effects don't indicate the level of immunity conferred by its vaccine. It wouldn't be able to demonstrate such high efficacy, if the only people protected were the ones with symptoms, she said.</p><p>Moderna didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot Covid-19 vaccine uses a different technology than the Pfizer and Moderna shots. A large study found that injection-site pain affected about 49% of recipients, while headache, fatigue or muscle ache occurred at lower rates. A small number of J&amp;J vaccine recipients have developed serious blood clots.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration says age, sex and general health likely influence the occurrence and severity of common side effects in the first couple of days after vaccination. Side effects don't correlate with the effectiveness of a vaccine in an individual, an FDA spokeswoman said.</p>",
