  "title": "Pfizer Ups Covid-19 Vaccine Forecast as Sales More Than Double; Shot's $13 billion revenue was single biggest contributor to firm's third quarter sales",
  "text": "<p>The vaccine remains in global demand in countries that are receiving initial supplies and others that have begun booster campaigns, as well as those that have yet to receive any supplies at all. The U.S. has authorized additional shots of the vaccine for many high-risk adults and last week cleared use of the vaccine for children as young as 5 years old.</p><p>While data from Pfizer and other researchers have shown an additional dose may increase protection, the company said Tuesday it is now weighing whether to begin a clinical trial evaluating a fourth dose of the vaccine, as a way to assess annual vaccinations. The company recently said that a third dose was found in a large study to be safe and highly protective against symptomatic Covid-19.</p><p>The vaccine's revenue of $13 billion was the biggest contributor to Pfizer's third-quarter sales of about $24 billion, which more than doubled year over year. More than 75% of vaccine sales this year are from international sales, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How will success in the Covid-19 vaccine race change the future for Pfizer? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Pfizer said it expects initial results on its experimental Covid-19 antiviral, which is in late-stage testing, by the end of the first quarter of 2022. The company previously said it could see results by the end of this year.</p><p>Pfizer forecast $29 billion in sales next year off 1.7 billion doses, reflecting the durability of long-term sales and efforts by countries to curb the spread of the virus in winter months. Next year's revenue is likely to be even higher because the forecast reflects supply agreements signed through mid-October and Pfizer expects to produce 4 billion doses.</p><p>Should the sales materialize, they would make the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine the best selling pharmaceutical product of all time. The world's top-selling prescription drug in recent years has been AbbVie Inc.'s anti-inflammatory drug Humira, which sold nearly $20 billion in 2018.</p><p>Pfizer splits vaccine sales with BioNTech.</p><p>The outlook for Pfizer's vaccine reflects the preference of the vaccine over ones from its rivals. Nearly 200 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, with more than half receiving Pfizer-BioNTech shots. Most of the rest received the vaccine from Moderna Inc. that uses a similar mRNA-based technology.</p><p>Pfizer has also distributed two billion doses so far and is on track to produce three billion doses.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is expected to be available soon in the U.S. to children as young as 5 years old, after U.S. health authorities last week authorized its emergency use as the first Covid-19 shot for the youngsters. The shot is fully approved for people 16 years and up, and is cleared for emergency use in children 12 and older.</p><p>Initial results from a clinical study of the vaccine in children 2 to 4 years are expected by the end of the year, while data in children 6 months to under 2 should be in by the end of next quarter, said Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten,</p><p>U.S. regulators have cleared boosters for people vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least six months after their second dose, as long as they are seniors or at high risk because of underlying medical conditions or their workplace. The regulators have since broadened availability of boosters to people who received Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has advanced through clinical trials and regulatory hurdles faster than rival shots cleared for use in adults.</p><p>Moderna said recently it won't seek approval for its vaccine's use in young children until the Food and Drug Administration clears the shots for teenagers. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the third vaccine cleared for use in the U.S., is studying the shot in teens but hasn't started studying it yet in younger children.</p><p>Pfizer also raised its overall financial guidance for the year, forecasting sales of $81 billion to $82 billion, and adjusted earnings of $4.13 a share to $4.18 a share. It attributed the increase to both vaccine and non-vaccine momentum.</p><p>Excluding the Covid-19 vaccine, sales of Pfizer's other drugs rose by 7%. Oncology drug sales rose 12% to more than $3 billion as sales jumped on breast cancer treatment Ibrance and prostate cancer drug Xtandi. Revenue for blood thinner grew 21% to more than $1.3 billion.</p><p>Stripping out one-time items, the company's adjusted third-quarter profits were $1.34 a share. Wall Street analysts had predicted $22.58 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $1.08 a share.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
