  "title": "Obituaries: Doctor Pioneered MRI Scanning",
  "text": "<p>Raymond Damadian, a young physician, had an audacious thought in 1969 while using magnetic-resonance equipment to analyze cells inside a test tube: What if the device could be made large enough to wrap around a human being?</p><p>That could give doctors a richly detailed view inside bodies and help them diagnose cancer and other diseases. Dr. Damadian and a small team went to work on that project, with meager funding, at a medical center in Brooklyn. In 1971, he published a paper in Science that established how a magnetic scan could be used to distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissue.</p><p>The next step was to cobble together a human-scale magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scanner, involving large magnets and radio signals to explore the body's interior. At one point, Dr. Damadian had to bring in jackhammers to blast through a granite floor to provide more vertical space in his lab. An early test fried a mouse to death. After the defect was fixed, a second mouse survived, as did a turkey and Dr. Damadian's first human subject, who nervously endured a scan in 1977.</p><p>It was a moment of triumph for Dr. Damadian, who died Aug. 3 at the age of 86. Yet struggles and anguish lay ahead.</p><p>Dr. Damadian obtained patents and in 1978 formed a company, Fonar Corp., to make commercial MRI scanners. These powerful new tools began showing up in clinics and providing far more detail than X-rays could.</p><p>Giant competitors including Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Electric Co. made their own scanners. Dr. Damadian filed lawsuits, alleging they had copied his patented technology. After years of litigation, a court judgment required GE to pay $128.7 million to Fonar.</p><p>The biggest blow to Dr. Damadian came in 2003, when two other scientists, Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield, shared a Nobel Prize in medicine for their contributions to the technology behind MRI scanning. Dr. Damadian was furious that the Nobel committee had snubbed him.</p><p>He and his supporters bought full-page newspaper advertisements denouncing a \"shameful wrong that must be righted.\" Dr. Damadian continued to press the case. \"If anybody deserved to get the Nobel Prize first, I did,\" he told The Wall Street Journal. \"If defending yourself when you're mutilated is egocentricity, then I'm guilty.\"</p><p>In \"Gifted Mind,\" a 2015 memoir written with Jeff Kinley, Dr. Damadian suggested that the Nobel committee may have shunned him because of his rejection of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. \"I hold to a literal six-day creation scenario as described in Genesis,\" he wrote. In any case, he credited his MRI discoveries to divine inspiration.</p><p>Raymond Vahan Damadian was born into a family of Armenian descent in New York on March 16, 1936. His father, an immigrant, was a photo engraver at a newspaper. His mother was an accountant.</p><p>He attended the University of Wisconsin on a scholarship and majored in mathematics. He earned his medical degree at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p><p>Though he didn't win the Nobel, recognition for his discoveries came in the form of a National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Reagan in 1988.</p>",
