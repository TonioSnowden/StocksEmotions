  "title": "U.S.-Canada Border Restrictions: What to Know About Crossing Requirements; Canada to drop vaccination-entry rules, mask requirements on Oct. 1",
  "text": "<p>Canada will rescind existing border restrictions as of Oct. 1. Mayors in communities along the U.S.-Canada border urged governments in Washington and Ottawa in an open letter this month to remove all barriers. \"Land borders are regulated at the expense of communities whose entire livelihood depends on the back-and-forth crossing of the U.S.-Canada border,\" they said in the letter.</p><p>Can U.S. citizens visit Canada now?</p><p>Yes. Up until Sept. 30, Americans need to be fully vaccinated and meet other Canadian government criteria to enter Canada for nonessential purposes such as tourism and recreation.</p><p>Fully vaccinated tourists from other countries also have permission to enter Canada, as long as they meet all the government's Covid-19 travel requirements and, depending on their citizenship, have a valid visa or electronic travel authorization.</p><p>Starting Oct. 1, Canada is dropping the vaccination requirement to enter the country. Canadian officials say public-health data indicates the majority of Covid-19 hospitalizations are due to infection within local communities, and cross-border Covid-19 transmission isn't a significant factor.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, Canada allowed its own citizens or permanent residents to enter the country. Essential workers—most notably truck drivers—were able to cross the border as both countries agreed that trade of goods and services wouldn't be affected. That changed as of Jan. 15, when Canada required essential workers like truck drivers, professional athletes and others previously exempt from public-health orders to be fully vaccinated for Covid-19 to gain entry. The U.S. imposed similar measures on Jan. 22.</p><p>The measures related to truck drivers helped spark a series of protests in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, and at border crossings in Montana and Detroit, causing delays and detours for some Canada-bound travelers.</p><p>Do I need to be fully vaccinated to cross the border?</p><p>Up until Sept. 30, if you're traveling for nonessential reasons, such as tourism or to visit a property in Canada, you need to be fully vaccinated with an accepted Covid-19 vaccine or a combination of two different accepted vaccines.</p><p>Canada accepts Covid-19 vaccines authorized by its regulator, from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca PLC. Canada also accepts vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, thereby adding China-made Sinopharm and Sinovac, and Covaxin from India.</p><p>Starting Oct. 1, Canada will stop requiring Covid-19 vaccination.</p><p>What documents do I need to travel to Canada?</p><p>Up until Sept. 30, travelers need to upload proof of vaccination and other information to a Canadian government app or website called ArriveCAN before they board a flight or reach a land crossing. They also must carry a paper or digital copy of their proof of vaccination with them.</p><p>Those who meet all the government's requirements won't have to quarantine.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Planning to travel to Canada?

Canada is also scrapping random testing.</p><p>What are the current Covid-19 restrictions in Canada?</p><p>Although face masks are no longer required for public transportation in the U.S., the Canadian federal government's masking rules require people to continue to wear masks while inside Canadian airports and for the full duration of any flight to or from a Canadian airport.</p><p>The Canadian rules permit passengers to remove their masks only for brief periods while eating, drinking or taking medication, or if they have an exemption such as a medical certificate saying they are unable to wear a mask.</p><p>This changes on Oct. 1, when Canada says wearing masks at airports, on flights, and on long-distance passenger-rail service will be optional. Officials recommend travelers continue to wear high-quality and well-fitted masks during their journeys.</p><p>Canada's regional authorities have dropped most Covid-19 restrictions during 2022, including proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms.</p><p>What is the Covid-19 situation like in Canada?</p><p>Canada recorded a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases starting in early December driven by the Omicron variant, but cases peaked in early January and later fell dramatically.</p><p>About 83% of Canadians were fully vaccinated as of Sept. 26, compared with 68% of Americans. Canada is ahead of the U.S. by a sizable margin in administering Covid-19 booster doses, according to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data.</p><p>Canadian officials said a number of factors—among them immunity within the Canadian population, lower hospitalization and death rates, high vaccination rates, as well as the availability of vaccines targeting Covid-19 Omicron variants—support the lifting of border measures and travel requirements, starting on Oct. 1.</p><p>Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com</p><p>U.S.-Canada Border Restrictions: What to Know About Crossing Requirements</p>",
