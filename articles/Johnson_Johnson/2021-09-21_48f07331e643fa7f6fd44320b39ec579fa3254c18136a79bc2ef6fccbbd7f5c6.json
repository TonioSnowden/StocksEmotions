  "title": "Dow up slightly as stocks struggle after Evergrande sparks worst day since May",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX advanced 7.79 points, or 0.2%, to 4,365.52.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 60.23 points, or 0.4%, at 14,774.13.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow fell 614 points, or 1.8%, to 33970, the S&amp;P 500 declined 75 points, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 330 points, or 2.2%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Efforts to “buy the dip” in the wake of Monday's selloff could prove premature, analysts warned.</p><p>The worries over Evergrande came at a critical juncture, with several firms having warned, correctly, that September would be bumpy for U.S. equities after a smooth summer.</p><p>While worries about China Evergrande Group HK:3333, the property developer expected to default in coming weeks, set the tone for the weakness, the market “was just looking for a reason to pull back,” Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.</p><p>Stocks, as measured by major indexes, have rallied in 2021, with the S&amp;P 500 yet to suffer a 5% pullback. Concerns about an Evergrande default as well as expectations the Federal Reserve will move to begin pulling back on some of the extraordinary stimulus implemented during the early days of the pandemic, and signs of peak economic and earnings growth have all been cited by market watchers as factors that could contribute to at least a near-term pullback.</p><p>Young said the market is likely to see heightened volatility through the remainder of September and well into October, which would give investors holding cash the opportunity to add to market exposure through dollar-cost averaging.</p><p>Over the long run, she remains constructive on cyclicals, including industrials, materials, financials and consumer discretionary.</p><p>As far as Evergrande is concerned, the selloff appeared to be “primarily driven by technical selling flows (CTAs and option hedgers) in an environment of poor liquidity, and overreaction of discretionary traders to perceived risks,” said Marko Kolanovic, chief global markets strategist at JPMorgan Chase. Kolanovic anticipates a recovery as the delta wave of coronavirus fades, and expects companies to beat expectations on third-quarter earnings.</p><p>Wall Street analysts were at pains to say that Evergrande isn't China's Lehman moment.</p><p>“A true ‘Lehman moment' is a crisis of a very different magnitude,” said analysts at Barclays led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha. “One would need to see a lenders' strike across large parts of the financial system, a sharp increase in credit distress away from the real-estate sector, and banks being unwilling to face each other in the interbank funding market. And with all that, we would also need to see massive policy mistakes on the part of Chinese authorities,”</p><p>Read:Will Evergrande be China's ‘Lehman moment'? Wall Street says no</p><p>The Federal Reserve on Tuesday kicks off a two-day meeting that could lead to a more hawkish interest-rate forecast, while Congress has not so far increased the federal debt ceiling as it struggles to agree on a package of infrastructure spending.</p><p>Even after Monday's fireworks and losses in nine of the last 11 sessions, the S&amp;P 500 is only 4% below its record high.</p><p>In public health news, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ&#xa0;said data from a Phase 3 trial and real-world evidence confirm that its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine offers strong and long-lasting protection against hospitalization and death. The company said further data shows that a booster shot offers increased protection and antibodies.&#xa0;</p><p>U.S. home builders started construction on homes at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.62 million in August, a 3.9% increase from the previous month, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday. Compared with August 2020, housing starts were up 17.4%. The pace of permitting for new housing units also increased in August, up 6% from July and 13.5% from a year ago.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Uber Technologies Inc.&#xa0;UBER rallied more than 9%, after the ride-sharing company updated its third-quarter outlook following its first months of profitability in adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in July and August.</p><p>Shares of Bill.com Holdings Inc.&#xa0;BILL&#xa0;dropped 6%, after the provider of software aimed at simplifying back-office operations announced the offering of $1 billion of common stock to the public and $500 million in convertible debt to qualified institutional investors.</p><p>Transfix Inc., a digital freight platform, said Tuesday it is going public by merging with special-purpose acquisition corporation G Squared Ascend&#xa0;GSQD,&#xa0;+1.55%&#xa0;in a deal with a pro forma enterprise value of $1.1 billion.</p><p>Shares of Activision Blizzard Inc.&#xa0;ATVI&#xa0;were off 2.5% after the company said that it was continuing to address and resolve workplace complaints as it cooperates with&#xa0;a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation&#xa0;into disclosures on employment matters.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;edged down 0.3 basis point to 1.307% after the benchmark yield saw its biggest rise since Aug. 13, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Chinese markets remain closed until Wednesday.</p><p>Markets in Europe also saw gains, with the Stoxx Europe 600 XX: SXXP up 0.9%, while London's FTSE 100 UK: UKX rose 1%.</p>",
