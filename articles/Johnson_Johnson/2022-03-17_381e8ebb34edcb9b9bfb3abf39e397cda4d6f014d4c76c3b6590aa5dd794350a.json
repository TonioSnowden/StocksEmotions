  "title": "Canada Eases Covid-19 Border Testing Rules; Fully vaccinated travelers will no longer need to show proof of negative Covid-19 test beginning in April",
  "text": "<p>Businesses and travelers for months have asked for the restrictions to be eased, saying the testing requirement made it difficult for people to take short trips across the border to shop, visit tourist attractions or see family and friends. Canadian officials said the change was possible because of the country's high vaccination rate and a decline in Covid-19 hospitalizations.</p><p>Nearly 82% of the Canadian population is considered fully vaccinated, which generally means they have received at least two doses of the vaccines produced by Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine.</p><p>\"The revised border measures we're announcing today are possible thanks to the millions of Canadians who have stepped up, rolled up their sleeves and gotten vaccinated,\" Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said.</p><p>Travelers who aren't fully vaccinated will still need to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test or evidence that they have recently recovered from the disease before entering the country. They also are required to take a Covid-19 test upon their arrival and another test about a week later, and in most cases must quarantine for 14 days.</p><p>The move to ease Covid-19 testing rules comes several weeks after the end of a series of disruptive protests over vaccine mandates and Covid-19 restrictions, which took place in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, and at some border crossings.</p><p>Protesters were demanding an end to vaccine mandates and restrictions imposed by the Canadian federal government and provinces. Many had used heavy trucks to shut down some roads and border crossings, and protesters in Ottawa were removed only after the federal government invoked emergency measures last month.</p><p>The government said Thursday that vaccine mandates for most people boarding an airplane or taking a long-distance train in Canada remain unchanged. In addition, travelers crossing the border into Canada will still need to fill out a mobile or online form called ArriveCan before they enter the country.</p><p>Some testing requirements will remain in place for people traveling on cruise ships this spring, officials said. Those taking a cruise must be fully vaccinated and must take a Covid-19 test one day before their scheduled departure, Mr. Alghabra said. Passengers won't be required to take a test when the cruise ends.</p><p>Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, said it welcomed the change to testing rules. \"Canada now joins other countries around the world in reopening and we look ahead to the summer travel season,\" said David Rheault, the airline's vice president of government and community relations.</p><p>Canada Eases Covid-19 Border Testing Rules</p>",
