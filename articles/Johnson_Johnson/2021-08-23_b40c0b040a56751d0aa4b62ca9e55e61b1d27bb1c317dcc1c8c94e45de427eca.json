  "text": "<p>The UK has ordered a further 35m doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for delivery in the second half of next year, as the government prepares to counter possible future mutations of coronavirus.</p> <p>The latest contract with the US pharmaceutical company brought the total number of Pfizer shots ordered by the UK to 135m, including 40m that have already been delivered and 60m due this autumn. </p> <p>Sajid Javid, health secretary, said it was “vital” to protect the UK population from the virus in the future. “I am pleased we've reached this agreement with Pfizer for more doses as part of our robust preparations to future-proof our vaccine programme, ensuring we have plans in place to keep the nation safe for years to come,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Scientists are debating the need for boosters to improve immunity to Covid as the Delta variant surges around the world. </p> <p>The UK government is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1432a78-31e7-4764-8d7b-c4cfd2535cf0\">preparing a booster programme</a> this autumn but is waiting on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which is expected in September.</p> <p>Israel is already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23cdbf8c-b5ef-4596-bb46-f510606ab556\">giving booster shots</a>, while the US said this month that it would begin offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b003e7a2-6f3c-4f3d-8a95-20dd6fa976ea\">third jabs</a> in the coming months.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pfizer has expanded vaccine production for 2022 to 4bn doses, up from 3bn this year. The US drugmaker has encouraged governments to sign contracts for the future, arguing that boosters would probably be necessary after six to eight months. </p> <p>Recent studies based on real-world evidence have shown antibody levels in the vaccinated declined over time. One study from Oxford, published last week, found that the Pfizer shot's efficacy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49641651-e10a-45f6-a7cc-8b8c7b7a9710\">declined at a faster rate</a> than the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, albeit from a higher level of effectiveness. </p> <p>The UK is likely to have paid more for next year's doses than in its original contract, as Pfizer has raised prices in other markets. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d415a01e-d065-44a9-bad4-f9235aa04c1a\">The EU paid&#xa0;€19.50</a> per shot, up from €15.50, in its most recent deal for 1.8bn doses for delivery next year and in 2023.</p> <p>The Department&#xa0;of Health and Social Care declined to comment&#xa0;on the price paid for the jabs, citing “commercial sensitivities”.&#xa0;Pfizer declined to comment.</p> <p>The Pfizer vaccine received <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/745d6d29-86f1-4116-9e72-cdd5e7218f6e\">full US regulatory approval</a> on Monday, a move that some public health experts hoped would bolster its acceptance among vaccine-hesitant Americans and around the world. </p> <p>The UK government has ordered more than 500m doses of Covid vaccines in total. It still has outstanding orders for vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson, a single shot that has been approved but is awaiting delivery, Novavax, which has not yet received approval, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/846c00e4-06ba-417d-978c-98caef7f605a\">Valneva</a>, which is conducting its phase 3 trial. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sarah Neville in London</em></p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in London 2021 'UK orders 35m more Pfizer Covid jabs for next year' FT.com 23 August.
