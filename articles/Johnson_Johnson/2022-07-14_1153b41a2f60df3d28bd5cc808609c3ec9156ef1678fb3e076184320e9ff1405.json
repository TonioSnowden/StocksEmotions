  "title": "U.S. News: FDA Authorizes Use of Novavax's Covid-19 Vaccine",
  "text": "<p>The Novavax vaccine, given as two doses three weeks apart, could become available soon if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signs off in the coming days.</p><p>The authorization gives adults \"another option that meets the FDA's rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency-use authorization,\" FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said.</p><p>The agency is likely to expand the authorization to younger ages in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Supplies should be available soon. On Monday, the federal government agreed to secure an initial 3.2 million doses of Novavax's vaccine pending FDA authorization. The shots will be given at no charge at pharmacies and through state and local programs.</p><p>Demand could be limited, however. Many of the people who have wanted to get vaccinated have done so during the 19 months since vaccines were first rolled out.</p><p>About 67% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, defined as two doses of mRNA vaccines or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine, according to the CDC. About 48% of fully vaccinated people have received a first booster dose, and even fewer a second booster.</p><p>Novavax has said its protein-based vaccine might appeal to some of the people who have been reluctant to receive the two leading Covid-19 vaccines. Those shots, from Moderna Inc. and from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, use gene-based messenger RNA technology.</p><p>A recent poll by Morning Consult, however, found that 77% of unvaccinated U.S. adults probably or definitely won't get a protein-based vaccine such as Novavax's if one became available. Some 10% of unvaccinated people said they would probably or definitely get a protein-based shot, according to the poll.</p><p>Novavax developed the shot to target the original strain of the coronavirus. In a study of nearly 30,000 people in the U.S. and Mexico, the Novavax vaccine was 90.4% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease in adults. In testing, the most common side effects of the vaccine were injection-site pain, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.</p><p>The FDA said the fact sheets for the Novavax vaccine warn that it increases the risk of the heart-inflammation conditions myocarditis and pericarditis. The FDA said that in most cases, symptoms began within 10 days following vaccination and that people should seek medical attention right away if they experience chest pain, shortness of breath and other symptoms.</p><p>The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer also have been linked to increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.</p><p>The large study of the Novavax vaccine was conducted mostly in early 2021, however, before the spread of the most concerning new variants of the coronavirus, Delta, Omicron and BA.5.</p><p>Omicron and the highly contagious BA.5 subvariant have been shown to escape some of the protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines. The Novavax vaccine and other shots were designed to target the ancestral strain of the coronavirus that was predominant early in the pandemic.</p><p>Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., has said its vaccine still induces immune responses against Omicron and its subvariants including BA.5. The company is also working on a modified vaccine that would better target BA.5 and could be available by the end of the year.</p><p>---</p><p>Liz Essley Whyte contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
