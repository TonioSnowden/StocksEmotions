  "text": "<p>   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Latin America, once a hot spot of Covid-19 deaths, now leads the U.S. and much of the world in vaccinations, as supply concerns have eased and officials seek to shield their countries from new variants roiling other regions. </p><p>   Applying a mix of Chinese, European and American vaccines, about 62% of South America's population has received two shots or the single dose by Johnson &amp; Johnson. That is more than the 60% of Europeans inoculated with two doses, the 56% of people in North America and the 54% in Asia, according to Our World in Data, a pandemic research project at the University of Oxford. Only Australia has fully vaccinated a bigger percentage of its people. </p><p>   Thanks in part to the successes from past inoculation campaigns, like the fight against yellow fever, citizens across Latin America generally embrace vaccines. </p><p>    The spread of the Omicron variant in Europe and the U.S. means it may still be early to celebrate in the region, where the latest coronavirus strain is starting to spread just as families gather for the holidays. And not all countries have vaccinated effectively -- Guatemala, for instance, has only managed to deliver a first dose to a third of its people. Mexico lags behind other Latin American countries and all but two continents in fully vaccinating its people. </p><p>   Still, the vaccination drive across most countries underscores a dramatic turnaround for Latin America, which has just 8% of the world's population but by mid-2021 was accounting for a third of global deaths. In the past month, deaths have fallen to 8% of the world's total as the vaccination campaign has expanded in many nations, from wealthier Brazil and Chile to even some of the poorer countries, like El Salvador. Health officials say that is one reason cases haven't risen even with Omicron's arrival. </p><p>   Nearly two-thirds of El Salvador's 6.5 million people have received two doses, second in Central America only to more affluent Costa Rica. Healthcare workers attribute the progress to an aggressive effort by officials to procure shots through Chinese manufacturers, as well as from the companies producing the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. </p><p>   Across the region, health authorities say wider availability of vaccines has helped governments loosen restrictions on mobility and businesses as countries recover from a punishing economic downturn triggered by the pandemic. Brazil, which logged 618,000 deaths -- the second-highest in the pandemic after the U.S. -- has now largely gotten back to normal. </p><p>   \"The leap in vaccination rates is what took Brazil out of the center of the storm,\" said Carlos Fortaleza, an epidemiologist at Sao Paulo State University. </p><p></p>",
