  "title": "Texas Energy Regulators Can't Dodge Blame",
  "text": "<p>Neither gas, coal, nuclear nor renewable energy sources were themselves responsible for 2021's spectacular and tragic grid fiasco. Rather, the blame falls mainly on the shoulders of Texas lawmakers and regulators, who, despite warnings from experts, did effectively nothing to protect the state's power-generation gear from extreme cold.</p><p>John R. Kent</p><p>Fort Worth, Texas</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Christian is spot on in his assessment that reliable energy is essential. We need coal, natural gas or nuclear energy to help generate electricity. Energy from wind turbines and solar panels won't cut it. The energy cannot be stored. Who are these politicians who think climate change is an existential crisis? It isn't. What's their real plan in their green-energy plan? Are they scientists? Have they consulted any scientists or physicists? They have set unattainable goals of zero net carbon emissions.</p><p>What do Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, John Kerry or any other politician know about climate change? Perhaps as Allysia Finley suggests in \"The Weekend Interview with Alex Gorsky: Capitalism Is What Will Defeat Covid\" (March 20), we can apply the same free-market-based technology from people who know what they are talking about, instead of ill-informed politicians.</p><p>Matina Kantzavelos</p><p>Morton Grove, Ill.</p><p>---</p><p>Like Mr. Christian, I experienced the blackout while under the non-Ercot powered area in East Texas. Our blackout lasted only about 24 hours. Similarly, El Paso and Lubbock to the west also experienced much less severe blackouts. El Paso and Lubbock aren't in the Ercot zone. Cities in the Ercot zone experienced shortages lasting almost a week.</p><p>The Houston Chronicle recently outlined the sheer incompetence that led to avoidable blackouts in the Ercot area. Chief among them is the failure of the Texas Railroad Commission, on which Mr. Christian serves, to require the gas producers to seek emergency exemption from power outages. In addition, the TRC did not require any winterization of the pipelines and production facilities that ended up going down. In North Dakota, the gas producers and wind producers provide power in much worse conditions.</p><p>Not only am I a consumer of energy, I'm also a 30-year veteran of the oil and gas industry, where I served as a petroleum geologist. I know that when government doesn't regulate, our very competitive industry cuts costs to the bone. In 2011 Texas got a warning that this blackout could happen. Mr. Christian and others of his ilk were deaf to the warning and now point fingers to avoid accountability.</p><p>William Blount</p><p>Houston</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Christian's conclusion couldn't be more misguided. When he calls fossil fuels \"cheap\" as a source of energy, he clearly fails to factor in the all too real and immediate social costs of Texas' continuing reliance on them. He speaks of subsidies, saying that solar and wind get a free ride. But he fails to mention the tons upon tons of CO2 emitted over the years as if our atmosphere and our future were inexhaustible resources for the oil and gas industry to exploit. We now know that if we don't transition to renewable energy options, the effects will be far more catastrophic and enduring. It's time to quit pretending crises aren't real and to rally to bipartisan solutions such as a revenue-neutral price on carbon that will reduce our risk in the long term.</p><p>Dennis Arp</p><p>Brea, Calif.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Christian leaves out some facts that distort his conclusions.</p><p>Wind power contributes 23% of the Texas utility power system. A reduction of 52% in wind power leaves this source around 11.5%. He does not address the freeze-up of many of Texas' nonrenewable generation systems. Nor does he address the fact that Texas consumers have paid $28 billion more for unregulated power.</p><p>Deregulation is acceptable if the consumer is at the table and not bilked by politicians who grant utility companies free rein.</p><p>George Falk</p><p>Snowmass Village, Colo.</p>",
