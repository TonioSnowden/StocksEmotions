  "title": "Asia to Roll Out First Inhaled and Nasal-Spray Covid Vaccines; New vaccines are far less studied than existing Covid-19 shots, as regulators in China and India are first to give the green light",
  "text": "<p>Existing vaccines have succeeded in reducing symptomatic disease and severe illness, but have fallen short when it comes to preventing mild infections or transmission.</p><p>Earlier this month, regulators in China authorized for emergency use a booster vaccine delivered via inhalation developed by Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics Inc. Indian regulators subsequently approved a vaccine delivered through a nasal spray from Bharat Biotech International Ltd.</p><p>Researchers say the vaccines are the first of their kind to be approved by regulators. There are 172 vaccines in clinical development globally, of which there are two inhaled formulations and 12 nasal-spray formulations—including the two approved so far—according to the World Health Organization, which tracks vaccine development. Most are still in early-stage testing. Western companies including AstraZeneca PLC and Meissa Vaccines Inc. are developing intranasal Covid-19 vaccines, but they are in early stages and not close to being approved in the West.</p><p>Despite clearing the hurdles from regulators, both CanSino and Bharat said they don't yet have timelines for when they will be rolled out to the public in their respective countries. The new vaccines are far less studied than their injected counterparts and details of several of the most recent studies on them haven't been released in full.</p><p>\"It's very much the immediate next frontier,\" said Siddharth Sridhar, a clinical virologist and professor at the University of Hong Kong. \"It's important and definitely exciting to see how the data turns out in terms of its effectiveness.\"</p><p>China has developed its own injectable vaccines but has struggled to produce vaccines that have been shown to be of comparable effectiveness to those in the West. It also hasn't approved a homegrown mRNA vaccine like the widely used shot from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Indian authorities approved the country's first domestic mRNA vaccine earlier this year and the country is a major vaccine exporter.</p><p>CanSino's vaccine, called Convidecia Air, has completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, though only the results of the Phase 1 trial have been published. That trial of 130 people—the results of which were published in The Lancet in July last year—found that two doses of the vaccine generated an antibody response similar to one dose of an injected vaccine.</p><p>A study that wasn't peer reviewed of 420 subjects posted by CanSino in January said people who received a booster of the CanSino vaccine on top of two existing vaccines brought about an antibody response stronger than an ordinary booster. But the published trials didn't measure whether or how well the vaccine reduced the risk of symptomatic disease—the standard by which Western regulators have authorized the original vaccines. The original Western vaccines were tested on tens of thousands of people.</p><p>Bharat's vaccine, called iNCOVACC, concluded two clinical trials in India this year. They included a Phase 3 trial involving about 3,100 previously unvaccinated people who received two doses of the nasal vaccine, as well as a booster trial with 875 people who received a single nasal vaccine dose following two doses of another vaccine, according to Washington University School of Medicine, whose researchers developed the vaccine in collaboration with Bharat. The trials showed the vaccine produced a strong immune response, but they also didn't report whether it reduced symptomatic disease and the results haven't been released in detail or peer reviewed.</p><p>The new vaccines underscore concerns about the limits of existing Covid-19 vaccines: That many are effective at preventing death and severe illness but fall short when it comes to preventing milder infections or transmission of the disease, particularly when it comes to newer strains such as Omicron and its subvariants.</p><p>\"What we recognize with the injected vaccines is that they stimulate good antibody responses and cellular responses,\" said Ben Cowling, professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health. \"Where we need the protection is in our nose and respiratory tract because that's where we first come into contact with the virus.\"</p><p>Delivering a vaccine through the nose has the potential to build up a type of immune response known as mucosal immunity, or immunity in the upper airway tract, said David Curiel, professor of radiation oncology at Washington University School of Medicine who co-developed the Bharat vaccine. That is important because mucosal immunity could more effectively block infection and transmission of the coronavirus than the type of immunity induced by injected vaccines, he said.</p><p>Both new vaccines have a \"viral vector\" design that is similar to the injected Covid-19 vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. It uses an adenovirus—a virus that can cause the common cold—which is rendered harmless and engineered to include the genetic coding of the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine is delivered through the nose, this genetic code instructs human cells to make the spike protein, which in turn triggers an immune response that can protect a person if they later encounter the real virus.</p><p>Bharat holds rights to distribute its nasal-spray vaccine in countries outside of the U.S., Europe and Japan, where Washington University retains the rights. The university is in discussions to license U.S. rights to another company, Dr. Curiel said, which could start human testing of the vaccine in the U.S.</p><p>The intranasal vaccine might also stimulate other parts of the immune system better than injected vaccines can, which could lead to longer-lasting protection, Dr. Curiel said.</p><p>In a securities filing last week, CanSino said additional administrative steps remain before it can be rolled out to patients in China, and the company cautioned that it faces fierce competition in the country's vaccine market.</p><p>Pierre Morgon, executive vice president at CanSino, said additional trials of the company's inhaled vaccine were under way elsewhere around the world to pave the way for more approvals, including in Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com and Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>Asia to Roll Out First Inhaled and Nasal-Spray Covid Vaccines</p>",
