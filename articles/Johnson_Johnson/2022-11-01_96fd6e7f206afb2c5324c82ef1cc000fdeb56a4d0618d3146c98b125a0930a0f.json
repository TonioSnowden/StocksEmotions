  "text": "<p>Heart disease kills more Americans than any other. It costs the US <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/policy/polaris/healthtopics/heartdisease/index.html\">$219bn a year</a> in healthcare services and lost productivity. Johnson &amp; Johnson thinks there is money to be made in the cardiovascular field.</p> <p>The healthcare giant is plunking down more than $16bn to buy Abiomed, which makes a heart pump used by patients with severe coronary artery disease. Bulking up is one way to fight slower growth when top-selling immunology drug Stelara loses patent protection next year. The premium on offer is enough to send J&amp;J investors' hearts racing healthily.</p> <p>J&amp;J's $380 a share cash offer values Abiomed's equity at around $17.3bn. The offer represents a 51 per cent premium to Abiomed's closing price on Monday and nears the level the stock last traded at four years ago.</p> <p>Abiomed does have some cash on its books. Strip that away and that would give the deal an enterprise value of about $16.6bn. That still puts the company on an EV/ebitda multiple of over 58 times. That is rich, given J&amp;J's comments that any potential cost savings would be “very modest”.</p> <p>Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences, both of which have large cardiovascular businesses, command an average multiple of around 22. </p> <p>One has to wonder why J&amp;J, which is in the midst of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4a0986d-2c82-4e4a-973d-2de3247033aa\">spinning off its consumer products division</a>, felt the need to do a deal now. Sure, it is sitting on $34bn of cash and equivalent. But its pharmaceutical and medical device units — which pulled in $79bn in sales last year — continues to grow at a decent clip despite the hit from the stronger dollar.</p> <p>Abiomed, which generated just over $1bn in sales last year, is expected to pull in $1.3bn next year, according to consensus forecasts. Given that J&amp;J generates over 70 times those revenues, this is a small deal for the buyer.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the $35 a share in additional cash, worth $1.6bn, that Abiomed shareholders will receive if certain targets are met suggests that J&amp;J investors will wait a few more beats for a return on this investment.</p><p>Source:  2022 'J&amp;J/Abiomed: healthcare giant pays high price to bulk up on medtech' FT.com 1 November.
