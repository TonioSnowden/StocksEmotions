  "title": "J&J Injury Claimants Fail to Prevent Potential Talc Bankruptcy; Delaware judge declines to keep J&J from being able to separate talc liabilities from its core assets",
  "text": "<p>As of July, the healthcare company faced roughly 34,600 lawsuits linking its talc-based baby powder to ovarian cancer, asbestos cancer and other illnesses. In settlement talks, the company has said it could isolate its talc liabilities within a new corporate entity that could then file for bankruptcy, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.</p><p>Separating tort liabilities from corporate assets is possible under a Texas statute through what are known as divisional or divisive mergers. They have been used by several businesses facing large numbers of asbestos claims in recent years to silo those liabilities in newly formed units that were then placed in chapter 11.</p><p>J&amp;J hasn't disclosed any strategy for the talc lawsuits other than to defend the safety of its products in pending cases. The company also hasn't denied that a divisive merger for its talc liabilities is a possibility, Judge Silverstein said earlier this week.</p><p>Injury claimants said that would be a first step toward shifting talc liabilities into a bankruptcy proceeding, shielding J&amp;J from further jury trials. Talc claimants asked to restrain J&amp;J on the theory that its alleged strategy would harm the reorganization efforts of another company, Imerys Talc America Inc., which mined and supplied talc for J&amp;J for decades before its 2019 bankruptcy.</p><p>On Thursday, the judge said the injury claimants have no legal standing to seek such an injunction against J&amp;J because they have no direct interest in the contractual arrangements between the company and Imerys.</p><p>J&amp;J lawyer Diane Sullivan said the court \"rightly denied the plaintiffs' motion aimed at preventing J&amp;J from engaging in legitimate business transactions, in the event that it chooses to do so.\"</p><p>\"This was yet another frivolous attempt by plaintiff contingency lawyers to try and compel J&amp;J to settle their cases as J&amp;J continues to defend the safety of its products in the court system,\" Ms. Sullivan said.</p><p>The judge's ruling went against a committee appointed in the Imerys bankruptcy to represent individuals who allege they developed illnesses including ovarian cancer and mesothelioma after exposure to such talc-based J&amp;J products as baby powder and Shower to Shower.</p><p>J&amp;J has said its talcum powder, which it stopped selling last year, is safe and doesn't cause cancer, and that numerous tests over the past 40 years didn't show a presence of asbestos.</p><p>J&amp;J still faces scrutiny regarding its intentions for weathering the talc litigation. A House Oversight subcommittee asked J&amp;J for documents and information last month on any company plans to place a subsidiary into bankruptcy. Earlier this week, another group of cancer victims petitioned in Missouri state court to bar the company from a divisive merger.</p><p>Injury lawyers are concerned that shifting tort claims from state court to the bankruptcy system would favor J&amp;J, which could receive the benefit of the litigation stay even if only an affiliate files for chapter 11, according to legal experts. Bankruptcy filings generally halt tort cases and discovery proceedings, creating a single forum for companies beset with large liabilities to negotiate a restructuring.</p><p>\"We'll carefully consider Judge Silverstein's ruling and take our next steps,\" said Andy Birchfield, one of the lawyers pressing talc lawsuits. \"For now, this fight moves to a court in Missouri where a judge will consider our emergency request to stop in its tracks any planned bankruptcy abuse by J&amp;J.\"</p><p>Imerys, named alongside J&amp;J in talc lawsuits, sold its core business out of chapter 11 and has proposed a bankruptcy plan to resolve its share of liability on current and future claims. To fund compensation for Imerys claimants, administrators are pressing its alleged rights to indemnification, or reimbursement, from J&amp;J for the cost of defending and settling injury claims. The claimant committee argued that a divisive merger by J&amp;J could hinder or delay Imerys from collecting on that indemnity.</p><p>J&amp;J denies it owes Imerys any indemnification and argued in court papers that its corporate governance shouldn't be \"hijacked\" based on hypothetical harm and speculation about the possible effect of a divisive merger.</p><p>Judge Silverstein said Thursday that J&amp;J's assets aren't the property of Imerys, and that the contractual rights of Imerys aren't being eliminated in a divisive merger scenario. If J&amp;J can't honor its obligations after a divisive merger, Imerys has other \"avenues of relief,\" the judge said.</p><p>The use of divisive mergers ahead of a bankruptcy filing has been controversial when aimed at addressing asbestos liabilities. Earlier this month, a North Carolina bankruptcy judge issued two rulings that found solvent companies may have gone too far in creating near-empty vessels to shuttle asbestos liabilities into chapter 11.</p><p>Some congressional Democrats have proposed cracking down on the use of divisive mergers ahead of bankruptcies. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and other Democratic lawmakers would require bankruptcy cases stemming from divisional mergers to be dismissed, under some circumstances.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
