  "title": "Johnson & Johnson's Top Scientist to Depart; Paul Stoffels is the second top J&J executive in recent weeks to announce plans to leave",
  "text": "<p>The New Brunswick, N.J., company, which makes Band-Aid bandages and Tylenol pain reliever as well as therapies for diseases like cancer and psoriasis, didn't immediately name a replacement.</p><p>\"As a physician and a scientist, it is gratifying to see the healthcare landscape transformed as we unlock the best science and technology to deliver innovative medicines to solve the world's toughest health challenges,\" Dr. Stoffels said.</p><p>This is the second departure of a senior executive that J&amp;J has disclosed in recent weeks. In August, the company said Alex Gorsky will retire as chief executive and serve as executive chairman, effective Jan. 3, 2022.</p><p>J&amp;J named longtime executive Joaquin Duato to succeed Mr. Gorsky as CEO.</p><p>Dr. Stoffels is retiring to spend more time with his family in Europe and to cut down on travel, according to a person familiar with the matter. He frequently flew back and forth between the U.S. and Europe for his J&amp;J job duties.</p><p>Dr. Stoffels began his career as a physician in Africa focusing on tropical-disease research before joining J&amp;J's Janssen Pharmaceutica division in Belgium, his first stint at J&amp;J.</p><p>In the early 1990s, he left J&amp;J to co-found companies that would become Tibotec-Virco, a Belgian developer of antiviral drugs.</p><p>Dr. Stoffels rejoined J&amp;J when it acquired Tibotec-Virco in 2002 and helped lead the big company's development of HIV drugs. J&amp;J is now a leading seller of the medicines, which have helped turn infections into a manageable condition.</p><p>Covid-19 Vaccines</p><p>* Pfizer-BioNTech's Shot Is World's Preferred</p><p>He became J&amp;J's global head of pharmaceutical research and development at J&amp;J in 2009 and later served as chairman of the pharmaceutical unit for several years. He has served as J&amp;J's chief scientific officer of J&amp;J since 2012.</p><p>Since Dr. Stoffels took over pharmaceutical R&amp;D in 2009, the company's annual pharmaceutical revenue has doubled to $45.6 billion in 2020, making J&amp;J a dominant force in the industry.</p><p>The company has made successful bets on new drugs for cancer, such as Darzalex and Zytiga, while expanding offerings for immune-mediated conditions like psoriasis.</p><p>Under Dr. Stoffels' leadership, J&amp;J said, its pharmaceutical R&amp;D teams developed more than 25 new medicines, seven of which have been added to the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines.</p><p>Dr. Stoffels pushed J&amp;J to pursue medicines for the developing world, including one for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and vaccines against Ebola and Covid-19.</p><p>\"With Paul at the helm, Janssen rejuvenated its pipeline, launching multiple new medicines, making a difference for people all over the world,\" Mr. Duato said in a press release.</p><p>Beginning in early 2020, Dr. Stoffels oversaw the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and was often the public face providing updates on J&amp;J's progress. The vaccine proved generally safe and effective in a large clinical trial and was authorized for use in the U.S. this past February.</p><p>Uptake of the J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine, however, has been less than expected because of safety concerns surrounding a rare blood-clot condition seen in some vaccine recipients as well as manufacturing problems that limited the dose supply.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's Top Scientist to Depart</p>",
