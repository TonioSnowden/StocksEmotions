  "title": "J&J Talc Bankruptcy Case Moved to New Jersey From North Carolina; A new subsidiary put into chapter 11 last month will have its case moved to New Jersey where the consumer-products giant is based",
  "text": "<p>In his ruling, the judge said that New Jersey, where J&amp;J is based, is the \"superior jurisdiction\" for the chapter 11 case to unfold, given the large number of talc-related lawsuits and related insurance disputes already pending there.</p><p>The decision marks a setback for J&amp;J's strategy to weather the nearly 40,000 pending lawsuits alleging talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses, which J&amp;J denies.</p><p>Chapter 11 offers corporate defendants powerful tools to settle mass litigation over allegedly defective products, though some plaintiffs' lawyers, academics and lawmakers have said these companies are stretching bankruptcy beyond its intended purpose.</p><p>Judge Whitley on Wednesday also paused all pending talc litigation against J&amp;J and its affiliates for 60 days as the company and the injury lawyers suing it shift their dispute to New Jersey.</p><p>While the publicly-traded parent company isn't itself in chapter 11, it has sought to receive the same protection from further jury trials that its bankrupt unit now has.</p><p>Injury claimants want litigation against J&amp;J to continue, notwithstanding the bankruptcy. That dispute can now be decided in New Jersey, according to the judge.</p><p>J&amp;J had steered the bankruptcy case to its preferred venue through a corporate restructuring that ultimately placed its talc liabilities in Charlotte, which has become a landing spot for large asbestos bankruptcies.</p><p>J&amp;J first shifted its talc-related liabilities and assets to a Texas subsidiary, using a state law that allows splitting corporate assets from liabilities through what are known as divisional mergers. The Texas subsidiary was then converted into a North Carolina-based company—LTL Management LLC—shortly before filing for bankruptcy last month in Charlotte.</p><p>Judge Whitley said last month he wasn't sure whether the LTL Management bankruptcy belonged in his courtroom or should be moved to either Delaware or New Jersey, where thousands of talcum-related injury lawsuits against J&amp;J have been litigated for years. Law firms representing injury claimants supported moving the case, saying that J&amp;J had manufactured venue in North Carolina for purely strategic reasons, despite only thin connections to the state.</p><p>In recent years, several companies have used similar tactics as J&amp;J to hive off asbestos-related liabilities into subsidiaries that were then placed in chapter 11 in Charlotte.</p><p>LTL Management Chief Legal Officer John Kim said that while the company believes North Carolina was the appropriate venue for the chapter 11, \"we will continue to work with all parties to seek an efficient and equitable resolution.\"</p><p>Injury claimants have criticized the company's strategy, saying it would be an abuse of chapter 11 for a healthy business like J&amp;J to avoid tort litigation by carving off liabilities and placing them in bankruptcy. J&amp;J has said that a settlement negotiated in bankruptcy is fairer than continued litigation in state courts, where some victims win huge awards and others get nothing.</p><p>LTL Management was able to seek protection in Charlotte because of lenient venue-selection rules that allow troubled companies to file for chapter 11 protection in courts located far away from their headquarters. Congress is considering bipartisan legislation that would make rules governing where a company can file for chapter 11 more restrictive.</p><p>LTL Management lawyer Gregory Gordon said on Wednesday that Judge Whitley's expertise in bankruptcy cases involving mass-tort litigation would save the time and expense of getting another chapter 11 court up to speed.</p><p>But the judge said any expertise he has developed could be \"easily replicated\" in New Jersey, which he called a more \"natural fit\" for the proceedings.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Talc Bankruptcy Case Moved to New Jersey From North Carolina</p>",
