  "title": "Larry Culp Rewired GE. Then He Unwound It. Before General Electric's CEO could break up the conglomerate, he needed to make major repairs, from factory floor to 'carpetland'",
  "text": "<p>The solution was clear: rip out the old machinery and rearrange the production line to shorten the green string. In the process, GE upgraded the machines to help stop the logjams. When finished in early 2020, the blade traveled just 165 feet and production time was cut by 42%.</p><p>Before Larry Culp decided to break up GE, he had to break it down. The company's decision this week to split itself into three pieces capped a yearslong financial rehabilitation project during which Mr. Culp cut jobs, sold off businesses and slashed debt. Meanwhile, major repair work was happening behind the scenes.</p><p>Since taking over as chief executive officer in 2018, Mr. Culp overhauled manufacturing practices and made GE's far-flung divisions responsible for covering their own costs. In the process, he laid bare an organization that belied its reputation for operational and managerial excellence.</p><p>After shoring up GE's finances, Mr. Culp said this week that a simpler structure would be better for investors and customers. Two other giants, Toshiba Corp. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, also decided to split apart this week.</p><p>Mr. Culp arrived at GE with a reputation as a high priest in the world of lean manufacturing, a management philosophy that seeks to cut waste and create a culture of continuous improvement. He embraced the philosophy first at another conglomerate Danaher Corp., where he arrived after receiving an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.</p><p>\"When you're in a factory, when you're in a business and you're able to drive that type of improvement in that short a period of time,\" Mr. Culp said in an interview in early 2020, \"it is flat out addictive.\"</p><p>One of his first exposures to lean management was in the early 1990s when he worked in an air conditioner factory in Japan for a week as part of a training exercise. \"There's nothing like being screamed at in a language you don't understand. It's a tough love environment,\" he said.</p><p>He was named Danaher's CEO at the age of 37 and spent 14 years at the helm. The company became known for strong management and premium shareholder returns.</p><p>The concept of lean manufacturing was unofficially invented in the middle of the last century out of the work of a Toyota engineer named Taiichi Ohno who was tasked with making production more efficient in the post-World War II years in Japan. The system centers on an approach called kaizen, which focuses on seeking continuous improvement through in-depth sessions to assess employees' progress. It eventually became the Toyota Production System.</p><p>Executives go on gemba walks, which is walking the factory floor or its equivalent, and talking and learning with workers about what they are doing. Kaizen events can last a week and involve team problem solving, usually including all levels of workers and might find a top executive sweeping and scrubbing the floor.</p><p>The pieces and names can be different in organizations but the basics don't change. In an interview, Mr. Culp described it this way: \"There are three core ideas at work. One is the focus on the customer. The second is the elimination of waste. And the third is the ruthless prioritization of work.\"</p><p>Danaher eventually used the lean philosophy to run more than its factories. Its usefulness stretched into \"carpetland\", as office-based activities were called, where even a task such as processing an invoice or preparing a regulatory document can become more efficient in time expended and resources used.</p><p>When Mr. Culp became the first outsider to be GE's CEO in October 2018, jumping from lead director of the board, the inefficiency of office tasks wasn't his only concern. The company was in crisis after disclosing a possible $23 billion write-off as problems in its Power business worsened. GE was saddled with debt in its financial-services operations and needed cash. The share price hit levels not seen since the financial crisis.</p><p>Mr. Culp cut the quarterly dividend to a penny, and just four months into the job, he sold the healthcare division's life sciences business to his old company, Danaher. The deal would bring in $20 billion in cash to pay down debt and leave the division without its fastest-growing business. The move also halted his predecessor's planned spinoff of the healthcare division, a move that would have broken up the three core industrial divisions.</p><p>Mr. Culp, continuing the work of his predecessor, shifted thousands of workers from the corporate headquarters into GE's business units. The corporate layer, which had ballooned to 26,000 by early 2018, was half that size after Mr. Culp's first year and about 10,000 at the end of last year. Mr. Culp moved decision making and financial resources closer to customers into GE's almost 30 separate profit and loss statements, each with an executive team accountable for it.</p><p>GE's industrial free cash flow, a closely watched measure, plunged from $9 billion in 2016 to $2.3 billion in 2019, Mr. Culp's first full year. In 2020, the pandemic sapped GE's business and cash flow fell to $600 million. The company expects about $5 billion in cash flow this year and more than $7 billion in 2023.</p><p>Mr. Culp broke with tradition by hiring more outsiders to key senior roles, including chief financial officer Carolina Dybeck Happe and head of aviation John Slattery. He has also kept a tighter circle of advisers than the two CEOs who preceded him, said two former GE officials.</p><p>Mr. Culp became a frequent visitor to GE facilities where he would spend hours reviewing the operations and squeezing out inefficiencies. Some of his first months on the job were spent in Greenville where the outsider tried to understand why the company's core power business was losing money. The tangle of green yarn had some of the answers.</p><p>In early October, Mr. Culp spent five days at the GE aviation plant in Lynn, Mass., where his kaizen assignment put him with a small team studying a military engine part that was hurting on-time deliveries. The problem turned out to be an issue with welding on the part, leading to changes that went from yielding a usable part 59% of the time to 100% of the time. Nine different teams in Lynn that week made changes that cut costs by $2 million and reduced production time by 62 days, according to a memo Mr. Culp sent to employees.</p><p>A basic concept of lean management is to create standard work processes in order to continuously improve. If the same job is done differently every time or varies by worker, there is no basis for finding improvement. The same job must be done the same way every time. No detail is too small. \"Standard work is simply identifying the work steps required and the sequence of those steps, the time required for each, that go into making a process repeatable,\" Mr. Culp said in 2020.</p><p>While at the plant, something else caught Mr. Culp's eye, he wrote. The door to a men's locker room was misspelled \"LOCKEROOM.\" He wondered out loud how many people had walked by over the years without doing anything. The mistake was fixed in an hour after he mentioned it. One of the workers on his team joked, he wrote, that the spelling just reflected that Mr. Culp was near Boston, where the accent makes the \"r\" at the end of \"locker\" become silent.</p><p>Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research and a longtime analyst of industrial companies, said lean practices served Danaher well but the system isn't so easy to implement because each location has to learn. Moreover, it can take some people a long time to embrace it and others won't stick with it. \"Lean is a 10-year initiative, not a two-year initiative,\" Mr. Davis said. \"It is hard to implement lean and have it stick.\"</p><p>Mr. Culp has said that lean processes are helping GE find ways to improve the diversity of its workforce and he has used the techniques to manage his own time, perhaps the most precious resource of a corporate leader.</p><p>Prioritizing and cutting waste out of his calendar has worked in both his CEO stints, as well as the years in between when he juggled teaching at Harvard Business School with skiing out west and catching blue marlin off Costa Rica. But he doesn't let his evangelism of continuous improvement apply everywhere.</p><p>\"If you came and looked at my garage or my closet, you wouldn't see anywhere near the orderliness that you might see in a factory that I've been associated with,\" Mr. Culp said. \"I usually end my training sessions with, 'but don't try this at home.'\"</p><p>Larry Culp Rewired GE. Then He Unwound It.</p>",
