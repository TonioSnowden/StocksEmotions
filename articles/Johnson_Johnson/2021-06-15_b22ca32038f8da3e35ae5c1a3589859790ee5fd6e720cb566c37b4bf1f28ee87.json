  "title": "U.S. News:  Novavax Shot's Efficacy Tops 90%  ---  Vaccine gets closer to  global use as it shows  benefit against newer  coronavirus strains  ----  By Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   An experimental Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax Inc. was 90.4% effective at preventing symptomatic disease in adults in a large clinical trial, the company said, results that move the shot a step closer to global use. </p><p>   The 29,960-person study conducted in the U.S. and Mexico also found that the vaccine was similarly effective against newer coronavirus strains, especially the Alpha variant now dominant in the U.S., Novavax said. </p><p>   The vaccine, given in two doses three weeks apart, was also generally safe and well tolerated in the study, the company said. </p><p>   \"Our vaccine works very well even though the virus has mutated significantly,\" said Dr. Gregory Glenn, Novavax's president of research and development. </p><p>   Altogether, the results suggest Novavax's vaccine is on track to become the fourth authorized for use in the U.S. Yet Novavax executives said the regulatory clearances are months away because the company still needs to finish preparing manufacturing. </p><p>   If permitted by regulators, the shot could add a much-needed boost to global efforts to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, which has revealed growing disparities between developed and developing countries. </p><p>   The company has said it expects more than two billion doses of its vaccine to be produced annually when the company and its manufacturing partners reach full capacity. </p><p>   The shots also can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, averting the need for the freezers required for some other Covid-19 shots. </p><p>   Novavax Chief Executive Stanley Erck said the vaccine is likely to become available first in low- to middle-income countries through the international Covax initiative, possibly by the end of September. </p><p>   The company, with manufacturing partners, has pledged to deliver about 1.1 billion doses of the vaccine globally through Covax. </p><p>   \"At least in the foreseeable future, we're going to have a bigger impact\" outside the U.S., Mr. Erck said in an interview. </p><p>   Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., said it plans to request the vaccine's authorization in the U.S., U.K. and other countries during the third quarter. </p><p>    Novavax has experienced various delays in developing and manufacturing its vaccine. In May, the company said shortages in raw materials had caused production delays that would push back targets for reaching peak manufacturing capacity. </p><p>   In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration plans to take 30 days to review the manufacturing-quality data before Novavax may formally request an authorization of use, Mr. Erck said. </p><p>   The company has a contract with the federal government to deliver 110 million doses for use in the U.S. Mr. Erck said the company doesn't know if the government will decide to distribute them in the U.S. or contribute them to Covax and other countries. </p><p>   The vaccine would be the fourth authorized in the U.S., after shots developed by Pfizer Inc. with its partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. </p><p>   Novavax said 82% of the subjects in the study who got symptomatic Covid-19 -- and for whom genetic-sequence data were available -- were infected with newer variants. </p><p></p>",
