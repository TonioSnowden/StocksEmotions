  "text": "<p>Sweden is set to resume use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, although only for people aged 65 and over, but neighbouring Denmark has extended its suspension of the jab for three more weeks, authorities in both countries said on Thursday. </p> <p>The benefit of the AstraZeneca vaccine for that age group was high given how many were being infected and as there was little evidence of serious side effects in older people, Sweden's public health agency said in a statement. </p> <p>But the jab would remain on pause for younger people as Nordic health authorities investigate a number of cases where recipients — mainly women under 65 — suffered a severe and unusual combination of symptoms including blood clots, low platelet levels and bleeding. </p> <p>At least 16 countries in Europe suspended the vaccine earlier this month after the symptoms were identified. Most resumed vaccinations after the European Medicines Agency declared the shot safe last week but three Nordic nations — Sweden, Denmark and Norway — kept the vaccine on hold while they investigated the safety concerns, with France limiting its use to the over-55s.</p> <p>“We believe it's good and necessary to have a bit more knowledge about how rare [these symptoms are] and how we need to deal with [them], whether it's possible to find risk factors . . . so we can avoid this because they're very serious and often fatal,” Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, said in a video call. </p> <p>At least three people in Norway, two in Denmark and one in Sweden died after developing the blood disorders following vaccination with the AstraZeneca jab. More than 20m doses of the vaccine have been administered in EU countries and the UK. </p> <p>Finland suspended the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5852349c-d4c5-4da5-9c02-031d751db89f\">AstraZeneca </a>vaccine last Friday but on Wednesday reinstated it for those aged 65 and over. But Denmark, which was the first country to suspend its use, on Thursday said it would maintain the suspension for another three weeks.</p> <p>Soren Brostrom, director-general of the Danish health authority, said the situation was too “uncertain” to make a final decision about future use of the vaccine. “Many studies have been initiated, but we do not yet have any conclusions. Therefore, the hold on using the vaccine remains in effect,” he said in a statement. </p> <p>Norway is set to announce on Friday whether it will resume use of the vaccine. Steinar Madsen, medical director at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, this week said he thought the AstraZeneca jab should be given to all ages or none, rather than being recommended only for certain age groups. </p> <p>Tegnell stressed that as Sweden was so far only vaccinating the over-65s, the decision to recommend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48fe2e97-f9e5-4291-b965-0728bfc42213\">AstraZeneca </a>just for that age group made sense as it could have “a good effect on our pandemic”. He added that the country could use the vaccine more broadly “in a few weeks' time” once more studies were completed.</p> <p>The decision to use AstraZeneca only in older age groups is a reversal of the position adopted by some European countries in recent weeks, in which they recommended it only for younger people because of a lack of initial testing on the elderly.</p> <p>“I don't know if ironic is the right word,” said Tegnell, adding: “We are living in a world where the knowledge changes all the time, and of course we need to change with that so we are continuously using the vaccine in the best way.” </p> <p>He did not believe the vaccination campaign had been damaged by European countries taking different decisions: “I don't think confidence builds on us doing exactly the same thing,” he said.</p> <p>Sweden stood out in the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic by being the only EU country not to adopt a formal lockdown but in recent months it has tightened its restrictions.</p> <p>Separately, Norway and Denmark said they would receive far fewer doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in April than expected. Norway said it would receive 52,000 instead of its initial forecast of 310,000 while Denmark would get only 39,000 of its expected 495,000 from the US drugmaker.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 2021 'Sweden clears AstraZeneca vaccine for use in over-65s' FT.com 25 March.
