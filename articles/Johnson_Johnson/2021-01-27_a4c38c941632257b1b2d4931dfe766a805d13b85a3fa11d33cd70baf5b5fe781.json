  "title": "Biden Steps Up Goal For Vaccine Supply",
  "text": "<p>The purchases will provide enough supply to vaccinate 300 million Americans in a two-dose regimen over the summer. The vaccine isn't approved for people under 16 years old.</p><p>\"We now have a national strategy to beat Covid-19,\" President Biden, a Democrat, said Tuesday. \"It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it is detailed.\"</p><p>He nonetheless urged the public to remain vigilant, referring to the fight against the pandemic as \"a wartime undertaking.\"</p><p>\"The brutal truth is, it's going to take months before we get the majority of Americans vaccinated,\" Mr. Biden said.</p><p>Even with the increase in doses to states starting next week, supplies aren't yet sufficient for what is needed now, a senior administration official said.</p><p>The administration will also start providing states with three weeks' advance notice of their estimated vaccine allocations, updated on a running basis, to help with their planning. Governors had said allocations fluctuated under the Republican administration of former President Donald Trump, complicating efforts to staff vaccination sites and manage appointments.</p><p>\"We've been going week to week, and you really can't plan and schedule,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said on MSNBC. \"It will bring some efficiency to the program that we haven't been able to implement.\"</p><p>Members of the Biden administration, including federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky and White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients, briefed governors on the changes on a call Tuesday, people familiar with the discussion said.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services will boost allocations next week to a minimum of 10 million doses a week for all states and territories, up from 8.6 million doses a week, for the next three weeks, a senior administration official said.</p><p>Biden administration officials told governors that 5.7 million doses will be Moderna's vaccine and 4.3 million will be Pfizer's vaccine, people familiar with the call said.</p><p>The officials also told governors that the sixth dose that Pfizer recently discovered could be extracted from its five-dose vials won't count toward the allocation of the company's doses to states, those with knowledge of the call said. Special syringes are required to extract the additional dose and some pharmacies have struggled to extract it properly.</p><p>The vaccine rollout has been hindered by long waits for shots, crashing websites and early evidence that lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color are falling behind more affluent, white areas in getting vaccinated.</p><p>Mr. Biden had said he wanted to see 1 million vaccinations administered a day in his first 100 days, and on Monday he said the administration could reach 1.5 million vaccinations a day. Analysts had said that administering 1 million doses a day, an amount almost reached under the Trump administration, would put the U.S. on track to reach herd immunity to the virus in 2022.</p><p>Mr. Biden said Monday he was optimistic that any person who wants a coronavirus vaccine should be able to get one by the spring. The president said delivering on that promise will require boosting vaccine supply and the capacity of facilities where people can receive the vaccine.</p><p>To date, about 44.4 million doses of both vaccines have been distributed in the U.S., of which 23.5 million have been administered, according to the CDC. Of the doses administered, 13 million were Pfizer vaccines and 10.4 million were from Moderna.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has said it expects to report results of a large clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine by early next week and to deliver 100 million doses for use in the U.S. by the end of June if the results are positive and the vaccine is authorized.</p><p>Mr. Biden's plan would establish 100 federally supported vaccination centers and dispatch mobile units to rural and underserved areas across the country. The CDC will make vaccines available in local pharmacies beginning next month.</p><p>He has invoked the Defense Production Act to take certain steps to expand vaccine manufacturing, such as producing more equipment and materials used to make shots. He also will boost supplies of the syringe type that can be used to squeeze more doses out of vials.</p><p>Vaccines were initially allocated to states in December based on the size of their population. In December, CDC advisers recommended that initial supplies go to high-risk populations such as front-line health workers and nursing-home residents. The advisory panel said adults 65 years and older should begin vaccinations only after doses were given to essential workers and adults 75 and older who wanted them.</p><p>The Trump administration said on Jan. 12 it was changing the distribution system, providing allocations to states based on the size of state populations over age 65 and how effective states have been in getting the shots administered.</p><p>It also called on states to open up vaccinations to adults 65 years and older, but governors said there wasn't enough supply from the reserve to keep up with the surge in demand that followed.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo said that New York was \"functionally out\" of vaccines but expected new shipments in the next several days. New York's Erie County, which includes Buffalo, announced it was canceling planned vaccination clinics on Friday and Saturday due to a lack of vaccine availability.</p><p>California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly said Tuesday the state is currently vaccinating 125,000 people each weekday.</p><p>\"We look forward to increasing the cadence to make sure the needs of Californians are heard loud and clear and we're able to fill the pressing demands on vaccines as quickly as possible,\" he said.</p><p>The U.S. has seen 25.2 million confirmed Covid-19 infections and about 420,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>---</p><p>Tarini Parti, Christine Mai-Duc and Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article.</p>",
