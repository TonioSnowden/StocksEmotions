  "title": "World News: Vaccine Supplies Get a Boost From India --- Company lifts output, exports as Western countries focus on shots for their citizens",
  "text": "<p>The U.S., Japan and Australia have just pledged more than $200 million to help Indian companies expand their capacities faster and add one billion doses to the global supply. Tapping India's vaccine-production capabilities was at the center of virtual talks on Friday among the leaders of those three countries and India, an alliance trying to counter Chinese expansionism known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad.</p><p>China and Russia have been supplying vaccines produced domestically to much of the developing world, while the U.S. has focused much of its efforts on ensuring supplies for Americans.</p><p>The final details and scope of the Quad vaccine program are still being worked out, an Indian official said. It will start by financing an expansion of production capacity at an Indian company, Biological E Ltd., to make one billion doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. Authorities might later consider including support for the Serum Institute's production of a vaccine by Novavax Inc., the official said.</p><p>The program will attempt to replicate the success Serum Institute has had at ramping up production. Serum Institute at first had contracted with AstraZeneca PLC to supply vaccines only to countries in the developing world, but it was able to build production capacity so quickly that it is now filling orders in the West as well. This month, it sent five million doses to the U.K., home of the University of Oxford, which developed the vaccine with AstraZeneca.</p><p>Serum Institute could move more quickly than most because it already had more capacity than any manufacturer, much of which it could repurpose to produce Covid-19 vaccines. Before the pandemic, the Serum Institute was making around 1.5 billion doses of vaccines per year. It has been the go-to supplier for international organizations such as Unicef and emerging markets because it sells most vaccines at less than $1 a dose. It does that, and still makes a profit, by making batches of millions of doses at a time. Over decades, it has built skills, equipment and analytics few can match.</p><p>As soon as its first vial of the cellular material used to create the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived in May, Serum Institute's scientists started growing enough of it to fill large containers -- some able to hold 2,000 liters, or nearly 530 gallons.</p><p>Over time, its scientists figured out how to make the doses faster, tinkering with the process to get more out of each batch. The secret, Serum's scientists say, is knowing how to grow large amounts of cells in bigger bioreactors, the large metal vats used to grow the cells to make vaccines. It is also knowing the right moment to introduce the virus into the cells, as well as when to harvest that virus, which becomes the base for the vaccines.</p><p>It took months to understand the best way to mass produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, said Umesh Shaligram, an executive director at Serum. \"You have to understand -- to kind of sense -- how your cells are behaving, how a virus is behaving. It takes a bit of time to understand,\" he said. \"Each batch you run you understand better.\"</p><p>By December, it was making 30 million doses a month. This month it is making more than 70 million doses, and it expects to reach 100 million in the next month or two.</p><p>\"What we're doing now on a monthly basis is what most companies are doing on an annual basis,\" said Serum Institute Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla.</p><p>Serum Institute is now trying to repeat the rapid rollout, this time building capacity to produce one billion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, which was recently shown to be 89.3% effective at protecting people from the disease. In a separate facility in a new building, six 4,000-liter steel vats were being installed and tested.</p><p>Success has brought a new kind of headache as Serum has had to navigate a backlash against its announcements. As it began exporting tens of millions of doses world-wide, some questioned why the doses weren't being kept for Indians.</p><p>\"I humbly request you to please be patient, @SerumInstIndia has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world,\" Mr. Poonawalla tweeted in February. \"We are trying our best.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Rajesh Roy contributed to this article.</p><p>---</p><p>Scaling Up Output</p><p>Proves a Challenge</p><p>India has been the world's biggest vaccine producer for years. It produces more than half of the volume of the world's vaccines and has built a specialization in doing large batches of vaccines for emerging markets, which need each shot to cost less than a few dollars.</p><p>As mass production and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines has proved difficult, more countries and vaccine producers have been turning to India for help.</p><p>\"I think a lot of people don't understand why they can't get vaccines, why it is so hard to just get supply,\" said Serum Institute Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla. \"People underestimate manufacturing at scale; sometimes it's actually harder to manufacture at scale than it is to even develop or invent a vaccine.\"</p><p>This year, the makers of vaccines approved for use in the EU -- Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC -- cut deliveries because of manufacturing bottlenecks. China and Russia have also been running into problems with vaccine production.</p><p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office outlined what is getting in the way of making more vaccines in a report in February, saying the building of new facilities, delays in the delivery of equipment and other supplies and the lack of experienced managers have all weighed on expanding manufacturing capacity.</p><p>\"Vaccine manufacturing is highly complex and generally will ramp up at a gradual pace, rather than starting at full scale,\" the report said.</p>",
