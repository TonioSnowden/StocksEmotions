  "text": "<p>Faces U.S. Sanctions</p><p>The Biden administration on Friday imposed sanctions on a Ukrainian banking tycoon and former public official and his family for alleged corruption, marking a renewed effort by the U.S. to help Kyiv address a problem that finance officials say is at the heart of the country's economic and political woes.</p><p>While the action technically prevents Ihor Kolomoisky , his wife, daughter and son only from entering the U.S., the blacklisting is likely to complicate his ability to use Western banks and transfer his Ukrainian assets offshore.</p><p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Mr. Kolomoisky of corruption during his time as governor of the Dnipropetrovsk.</p><p>\"I also want to express concern about Kolomoisky's current and ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine's democratic processes and institutions, which pose a serious threat to its future,\" Mr. Blinken said.</p><p>Mr. Kolomoisky couldn't be reached to comment.</p><p>-- Ian Talley</p><p>---</p><p>CANADA</p><p>J&amp;J Inoculation</p><p>Is Approved for Use</p><p>Canada became the second major jurisdiction to authorize the use of the single-dose Covid-19 vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson .</p><p>The decision comes nearly a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's authorization, and marks the fourth vaccine Canada has authorized</p><p>Canada has a contract with J&amp;J to acquire at least 10 million doses, with options to purchase an additional 28 million doses.</p><p>Canada's vaccination rate sits at 5.8%, which badly lags behind the U.K. and U.S., and trails most major European economies.</p><p>-- Paul Vieira</p><p>---</p><p>SWITZERLAND</p><p>Voters Will Decide</p><p>On a 'Burqa Ban'</p><p>The Swiss go to the polls Sunday to vote on a proposal to ban face-coverings, both the niqabs and burqas worn by a few Muslim women in the country, and the ski masks and bandannas used by protesters.</p><p>Critics say the proposal, \"Yes to a ban on covering the face,\" is an ironic throwback to a time not long ago when violent extremism was a greater concern than a global pandemic, and say it would unfairly stigmatize Muslims who wear full face-covering burqas or niqabs, which have open slits for the eyes, in Switzerland.</p><p>Proponents, including populist, right-wing movements behind the idea, say it is needed to combat what they consider a sign of the oppression of women and to uphold a basic principle that faces should be shown in a free society like that of the rich Alpine democracy.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p>",
