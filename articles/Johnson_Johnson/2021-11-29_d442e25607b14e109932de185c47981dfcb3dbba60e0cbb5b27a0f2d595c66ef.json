  "title": "Ghislaine Maxwell and Her Trial: What to Know About Jeffrey Epstein's Alleged Accomplice; Opening statements in the trial of the British socialite begin on Monday, Nov. 29",
  "text": "<p>Her lawyers have argued she is a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in his jail cell in August 2019, about a month after his indictment on sex-trafficking charges. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell is the daughter of a former member of Parliament in the United Kingdom and billionaire publisher, Robert Maxwell. Her father died in 1991 after falling off his yacht, which was named the \"Lady Ghislaine.\" A few years later, the first public reports of Ms. Maxwell's romantic relationship with Epstein surfaced in tabloids.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that from at least 1994 through 2004, Ms. Maxwell recruited and abused underage girls with Epstein in locations including New York, Florida and New Mexico. They said she befriended girls by taking them shopping or to the movies and asking about their lives.</p><p>What was her connection to Jeffrey Epstein?</p><p>Epstein was involved in the finances for rich and powerful individuals over four decades. Among them were retail magnate Leslie Wexner, financier Leon Black, Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress Elizabeth Johnson and hedge-fund billionaire Glenn Dubin.</p><p>In a 2009 deposition, a former house manager for Epstein testified that Ms. Maxwell was his \"main girlfriend\" starting around 1992.</p><p>Epstein in 1995 renamed a company he had in Palm Beach, Fla., to Ghislaine Corp., which was dissolved in 1998, according to Florida state records. Epstein called Ms. Maxwell his best friend in a 2003 interview with Vanity Fair.</p><p>In depositions taken in 2009 and 2010 as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein, household employees said Ms. Maxwell was a central figure in Epstein's private life. Several said Ms. Maxwell hired, supervised and fired household staff, while directing the visits of dozens of \"massage therapists\"â€”typically young women.</p><p>When will the trial begin?</p><p>Opening statements begin on Monday, Nov. 29.</p><p>What is she accused of?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell, 59 years old, faces six criminal counts at trial including enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. The trial is expected to include testimony from her accusers.</p><p>She also faces two perjury charges, which will be the subject of a separate trial.</p><p>\"I have not committed any crime,\" Ms. Maxwell said at a court hearing earlier this month.</p><p>How is Prince Andrew involved?</p><p>An accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein filed a lawsuit against the U.K.'s Prince Andrew alleging the British royal sexually abused her multiple times when she was under 18 years old.In her lawsuit, Virginia Giuffre accuses Prince Andrew of raping and sexually abusing her while she was a minor and a sex-trafficking victim. The abuse created severe and lasting damage for Ms. Giuffre, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.</p><p>Prince Andrew, the second-oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, has previously denied Ms. Giuffre's accusations. In a 2019 interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Prince Andrew said he couldn't recall meeting Ms. Giuffre. Days after the interview aired, he said he would step back from public duties as a member of the royal family.</p><p>\"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, said in a 2019 statement.</p><p>How many years in prison does she face?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the most serious count, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. If convicted, her sentence would ultimately be determined by the judge.</p><p>Will the trial be televised?</p><p>No. Federal courts generally don't allow cameras in the courtroom.</p><p>Write to Anthony DeRosa at anthony.derosa@wsj.com and Corinne Ramey at corinne.ramey@wsj.com</p><p>Ghislaine Maxwell and Her Trial: What to Know About Jeffrey Epstein's Alleged Accomplice</p>",
