  "title": "NYC Scales Back New Year's Eve in Times Square; Covid-19 concerns to limit attendance to 15,000; masks, vaccines will be required",
  "text": "<p>Attendees will be required to wear masks and those aged 5 and up must also show they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Accepted vaccines include those from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca PLC, and China's Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd.</p><p>\"There is a lot to celebrate, and these additional safety measures will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year,\" Mr. de Blasio said</p><p>New York City has recorded a surge in Covid-19 cases, as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads. The city health department on Thursday reported a seven-day average of new daily coronavirus cases of 12,613, up from a 28-day average of 5,280.</p><p>With around 72% of the city's residents fully vaccinated, Mr. de Blasio has said his administration would avoid shutdowns and restrictions on businesses.</p><p>The celebration in Times Square started in 1904 when New York Times owner Adolph Ochs organized a party, including fireworks, to commemorate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, according to the Times Square Alliance. The first ball drop was three years later, and has taken place every year since except for two years during World War II, when people marked the New Year with a minute of silence followed by the ringing of chimes, the Alliance said.</p><p>Last year's New Year's Eve celebration was subdued, with just over 100 people invited to Times Square to ring in 2021, many of whom were first responders, front-line workers or their family members.</p><p>New York had planned for this year's celebration to return to a more pre-pandemic normal. \"We want it to be big, we want it to be full of life, we want it to be a great New York celebration,\" Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference in November.</p><p>The fast spread of the Omicron variant has caused various parts of the U.S. to respond differently. Across the Northeast and Midwest, including places with rising cases, anxious calls for caution have prompted the closure of some in-person classes, events and other festivities. In New York City, some businesses and Broadway shows have announced temporary closures. Yet the South, and rural areas, are largely plowing ahead, making fewer changes to holiday plans.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com and Jimmy Vielkind at jimmy.vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>NYC Scales Back New Year's Eve in Times Square</p>",
