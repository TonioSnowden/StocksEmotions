  "title": "U.S. News:  Civica Unit to Sell Generic  Prostate-Cancer Medicine  ----  By Joseph Walker",
  "text": "<p>   A unit of the hospital-owned pharmaceutical venture Civica Inc. has started selling a generic form of the prostate-cancer drug Zytiga in the latest attempt to shake up the U.S. prescription-drug market. </p><p>   Civica said one of its operating units will offer a month's supply of the drug, known generically as abiraterone acetate, to pharmacies for $160, and recommends that pharmacies sell it to patients for no more than $171, a 6.9% markup. </p><p>   Zytiga, first marketed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, went generic in 2018. Pharmacies sell other Zytiga generics at list prices of nearly $3,000 a month, though with coupons the price can be around $200 for patients without insurance who pay with their own money, according to GoodRx, a website that tracks pharmacy prices and connects consumers to drug-discount coupons. </p><p>   Civica will sell the abiraterone acetate drug through CivicaScript, a unit founded in 2020 to bring lower-priced versions of expensive generics on the market. </p><p>   CivicaScript was created by a partnership of Civica, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other health insurers as a public-benefit corporation, a designation that requires companies to pursue both social good and shareholder value. </p><p></p>",
