  "text": "<p>Profitable companies are enlisting bankruptcy courts to sidestep cancer trials. A handful of large, profitable corporations are using a new strategy to access U.S. bankruptcy courts, unlocking powerful legal tools for settling thousands of asbestos lawsuits for a fraction of what juries might force these companies to pay.</p><p>The legal tactic is shifting the balance of power toward corporate defendants Johnson &amp; Johnson, Georgia-Pacific LLC as well as U.S. units of Ireland's Trane Technologies PLC and France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA, which have corporate affiliates accused of previously selling products that contain asbestos, a cancer-causing mineral. These four companies are receiving legal and financial benefits from chapter 11 without risking the likely loss of equity value that would come from placing whole business divisions in bankruptcy.</p><p>Personal-injury lawyers are putting the bankruptcy strategy on trial later this month, seeking to dismiss the bankruptcy case filed in October by a J&amp;J subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, to drive a settlement of roughly 38,000 cancer lawsuits over its talc-based products.</p><p>Platinum Equity's Incora taps restructuring advisers for $2 billion debt. Incora, a distributor of airplane parts owned by Platinum Equity LLC, has hired restructuring advisers as the company faces a cash crunch brought on by low demand in the aerospace sector as a result of the ongoing pandemic, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Incora engaged PJT Partners Inc. as financial adviser, Alvarez &amp; Marsal as restructuring adviser and Milbank LLP as restructuring counsel to evaluate options for addressing near-term debt challenges, the people said. Incora faces interest payments due in May to holders of its more than $2 billion in bonds. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company's earnings have fallen far short of the projections it provided to bond investors in early 2020, when it agreed to be bought out by Platinum Equity.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Two Airbus jets head to bankruptcy sale despite secured lender opposition. Two Airbus jets owned by bankrupt Japanese companies are set to be sold in auction in March. Judge David Jones of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on Friday signed off on bidding process after making some changes to reflect concerns raised by secured creditor FitzWalter Capital Partners (Financial Trading) Ltd.</p><p>The sale process is moving forward after FitzWalter unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the chapter 11 case filed jointly by JPA No. 111 Co. Ltd. and JPA No. 48 Co. Ltd., entities owned by a Japan Investment Adviser Co. Ltd. subsidiary. Investment firm SVPGlobal has been tapped to serve as lead bidder for a planned bankruptcy sale. But uncertainties remain as FitzWalter insists that the jets' lease assets—the rights to use the aircraft—are controlled by the lender and not by the owners. – Akiko Matsuda</p><p>Latam Airlines defends fees for capital raise. Latam Airlines Group SA defended the fees it has proposed paying to creditors and shareholders in return for their committments to guarantee the sale of $5.4 billion in convertible notes and equity to fund the airline's exit from chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p><p>The creditors and shareholders' agreements to make sure none of the securities goes unsold are part of a broader proposed recapitalization of Latam, it said in papers filed Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. Fees being paid to participating investors are a sound exercise of business judgment, Latam said. The company faces a critical court hearing later this week on the terms of the proposed capital raise.</p><p>Participating creditors are supplying a backstop of $3.67 billion, while Delta Air Lines Inc. and other shareholders are providing an additional $1.77 billion, court records show. Unsecured creditors left out of the capital-raising program are protesting the fee payments, saying they are above-market and unreasonable. – Andrew Scurria</p><p>Distress</p><p>Green startups stumble, accelerating selloff of risky stocks. Electric-vehicle startups and other green tech companies soared early last year. Now a wave of investigations, outside allegations and growing investor skepticism have sent shares down 75% or more for many of them. Many of the companies went public through special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, an alternative to traditional initial public offerings.</p><p>\"You were getting complete silliness.\"</p><p>— Sam Peters, portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Burger King operator Dhanani Group reached a forbearance agreement with its lenders after a contentious dividend payout to its family owners.
