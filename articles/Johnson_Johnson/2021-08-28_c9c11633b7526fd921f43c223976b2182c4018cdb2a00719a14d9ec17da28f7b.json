The country also has bought 31 million doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. South Africa has fully vaccinated more than 5.4 million people with the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and the two-dose Pfizer shot, and has administered more than 11 million doses, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said Friday. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  LEBANON </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Caretaker Prime </p><p>\n  Minister Subpoenaed </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A Lebanese judge leading the investigation into last year's massive explosion at Beirut's port issued a subpoena for the country's caretaker prime minister after he failed to show up for questioning on Thursday, the state-run National News Agency reported. </p><p>\n  Last month, Judge Tarek Bitar confirmed charges filed by his predecessor against outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers. Mr. Diab was summoned for questioning on accusations of intentional killings and negligence. The judge also summoned former and current generals. </p><p>\n  Hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive material used in fertilizers that had been improperly stored in the port for years, exploded on Aug. 4, 2020, killing 214 people, injuring more than 6,000 and devastating nearby neighborhoods. </p><p>\n  Mr. Diab, who resigned following the explosion, said last year he was being singled out and charged while others knew more. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MEXICO </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Teachers Group </p><p>\n  Blocks President </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The SUV carrying Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was stopped and surrounded by a radical teachers group Friday, preventing him from leading his usual daily morning news conference. </p><p>\n  The incident occurred in the southern state of Chiapas. Mr. Lopez Obrador's vehicle was allowed to proceed after a couple of hours. </p><p>\n  The president sat inside the vehicle and refused protesters' demands that he hold a meeting with them then and there. In a live stream from inside the SUV shown at the news conference, Mr. Lopez Obrador said he couldn't allow himself to be held hostage by special interests. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MEXICO </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Tropical Storm Nora </p><p>\n  May Hit West Coast </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Tropical Storm Nora is rolling toward a brush at possible hurricane strength along Mexico's Pacific Coast and the Baja California peninsula over the weekend. </p><p>\n  The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Nora is strengthening and could bring dangerous flash floods and mudslides through the weekend. </p><p>\n  Nora may head up into the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez. But before that, it is likely to stay offshore but graze the region around Puerto Vallarta on Saturday and the Los Cabos resort region on Monday. The Hurricane Center said the storm could bring dangerous flash floods and mudslides through the weekend. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
