  "title": "U.N. Climate Summit Attendees Push U.K. for Vaccines; British government says it's on track to provide promised shots, but some NGOs worry about access",
  "text": "<p>Known as COP26, the climate summit will be one of the largest in-person international gatherings since the start of the pandemic. It is taking place as the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is driving up infections in many parts of the globe. That includes in host city Glasgow, where cases of Covid-19 are currently double the U.K. average.</p><p>In June, London pledged to ship vaccines to all delegates unable to get shots in their home countries ahead of the summit. The promise was key for many representatives from developing nations, especially in Africa, where access to Covid-19 shots remains scarce. With less than six weeks to go, many delegates say they have yet to get appointments for their shots from summit organizers.</p><p>Many nongovernmental organizations, in particular, have said delegates they wish to send still don't have shots. The U.K. government will allow unvaccinated delegates in, as long as they test negative and isolate before the conference. But some NGOs say the lack of a vaccine is forcing a tough call: Risk their delegates' health or don't send them, weakening their ability to shape the summit outcome.</p><p>The heart of the summit involves negotiations between governments that, in most cases, have been able to vaccine representatives they are sending. NGOs, companies, advocacy groups and other interested parties have converged on past climate summits to lobby government representatives and communicate their views to the media covering the event.</p><p>Related Reading</p><p>* Glasgow Climate Summit Faces 'High Risk of Failure,' U.N.

He declined to provide numbers on how many delegates had asked for shots and how many had already been vaccinated.</p><p>U.K. government and COP26 spokespeople declined to discuss details of how the U.K. is getting vaccines to delegatesâ€”for instance, whether they are sending them by mail or sourcing doses locally, or where they are being administered. \"Delegates from around 70 countries are receiving vaccinations,\" a COP26 spokeswoman said.</p><p>The U.K. spokesman said some delegates have already received a first dose of a two-shot vaccine made by AstraZeneca PLC and will get a second dose after four weeks. The U.N., meanwhile, is also providing Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose vaccine. The U.N. referred requests for comment on logistics to the COP26 media office.</p><p>Mohamed Adow, director of the Nairobi-based energy and climate think tank Power Shift Africa, is still waiting for his first dose. He said he received an email from the British government on Sept. 1, saying he should receive his dose midmonth. On Sept. 14, Mr. Adow got another email, this time from a U.N. agency, which informed him he would likely receive a Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, but still no date. Both sets of correspondence lacked detail on how the shots would be delivered.</p><p>Given the uncertainty over his vaccination status, Mr. Adow says that he hasn't booked his flights or accommodation yet, and that prices have been rising dramatically. He says he doesn't feel safe attending the summit without a vaccine.</p><p>\"How can participants represent themselves on equal footing when they aren't in the room,\" he said.</p><p>Earlier this month, Climate Action Network-International, which represents a global collection of more than 1,500 environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund, called for a postponement of the summit, citing complaints from members about the lack of vaccines and the high costs associated with pandemic travel-restrictions.</p><p>In response, the U.K. government said it would pay for mandatory hotel quarantine for delegates from countries on its \"red list,\" high-risk nations, almost all of them in the developing world. Travel into the U.K. from these countries is currently only allowed for British nationals and residents. Delegates from red-listed countries who are fully vaccinated will have to quarantine for just five days, but unvaccinated delegates will be required to do the full 10-day quarantine.</p><p>Sarah McFarlane in London contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Alexandra Wexler at alexandra.wexler@wsj.com and Sha Hua at sha.hua@wsj.com</p><p>U.N.
