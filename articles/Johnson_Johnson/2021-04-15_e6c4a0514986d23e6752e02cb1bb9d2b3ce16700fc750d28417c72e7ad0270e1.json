  "title": "American Adds Summer Routes  ---  Carrier sees capacity  returning to over 90%  of prepandemic seats;  destinations adjusted  ----  By Alison Sider",
  "text": "<p>   American Airlines Group Inc. said Wednesday it is preparing to operate a nearly normal summer schedule, anticipating that widespread vaccination will unleash appetite for travel. </p><p>   American is one of several carriers that have been adding flights within the U.S. and to nearby destinations such as Mexico and the Caribbean, seizing on signs of rising demand as people have started booking trips again. American said it would fly 150 new routes this summer, and now expects to offer more than 90% of its pre-pandemic seating capacity within the U.S., and 80% of its international capacity. </p><p>   Summer is typically the busiest and most lucrative time of year for airlines, but the coronavirus pandemic dashed their hopes for last summer's travel season. Carriers such as American that had bet on rising demand had to scale back their schedules when case numbers resumed their climb and many cities and states imposed new travel restrictions and clamped down on activities such as indoor dining. </p><p>   However, the U.S. economy has been revving up as more vaccines have been distributed. Airlines believe the rising demand they have seen in the past few weeks is likely to continue as more people are vaccinated, even though newly reported coronavirus cases have been on the rise in some areas and more infectious variants are spreading. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still advises against travel, it said earlier this month that it was a low-risk activity for people who have been fully vaccinated. </p><p>   Other airlines have also said they are seeing an increase in fuller flights and rising numbers of future bookings and have been rapidly filling out their route networks for the summer. Discounter Allegiant Travel Co. said last week that its average daily bookings in March were higher than in March 2019. Frontier Airlines, another low-fare carrier, on Tuesday announced eight new routes and plans to add service to Alaska. </p><p>   United Airlines Holdings Inc., which last month announced plans for more than two dozen new routes starting Memorial Day, recently told pilots in a town hall that over 40% of its flights from O'Hare International Airport are 90% full, a stark change from last spring when planes were flying nearly empty. </p><p>   Even though American's overall level of flying will approach 2019 levels, the map will look somewhat different. Like other carriers, American is responding to its customers' desire to go on vacation and visit national parks, beaches, and places where they can spend time outdoors. American is adding weekly nonstop flights to Orlando, Fla., from eight cities, including Dayton, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ala. </p><p>   \"Despite continuing to add more and more capacity in these markets, the bookings just keep coming,\" said Brian Znotins, American's vice president of network and schedule planning. And people are making plans further in advance, including for fall, he said -- a shift in behavior from the past year, when people were reluctant to commit to any travel plans more than a few weeks out as local restrictions and case numbers could change rapidly. </p><p>   There are still risks that could derail airlines' plans. Newly reported Covid-19 cases in the U.S. have been rising in some states, fueled in part by younger, unvaccinated people and more transmissible variants of the coronavirus. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has recommended that Michigan, for example, resume stricter lockdown measures. </p><p>   Adding to the yearlong debate about whether it is safe to fly during the pandemic, the CDC on Wednesday published a study concluding that the risk of exposure to Covid-19 is reduced by between 23% and 57% when airlines keep middle seats empty -- a practice that has largely been phased out. </p><p>   The CDC's study, conducted with researchers at Kansas State University, didn't draw conclusions about the risk of becoming infected with Covid-19 during a flight and didn't investigate how the use of masks might affect the risk levels. </p><p>   \"The extent to which exposure reduction might decrease transmission risk is not yet understood,\" the researchers wrote. </p><p>   Airlines have said the risk of virus transmission on a plane is low because of ventilation and filtration systems. Some studies have concluded that there have been cases of in-flight transmission, and that factors such as the length of the flight and seating proximity can play a role. </p><p>   Separately, on Tuesday, U.S. health authorities recommended a pause in the use of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine to investigate rare but severe cases of blood clots, a setback to vaccination efforts. White House officials have said the move won't have a significant impact on the trajectory of its vaccination goals. </p><p>   American also said it is adding nonstop flights between fast-growing cities that likely would have been routed through one of the airline's hubs, including a flight between Raleigh, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn. </p><p>   Demand is still muted in parts of the Northeast, particularly at airports that were previously heavily trafficked by business travelers. International travel continues to be subdued amid surging infection rates in other parts of the world and restrictions that make tourism difficult or impossible. However, American said it would use larger wide-body planes to take more passengers to Latin America and plans to bolster service to places such as Tel Aviv and Athens, where government officials have said they hope to allow vaccinated tourists. </p><p>   But Mr. Znotins said he is hopeful that the days of having to rip up schedules and replan the entire route network weeks before the start of the new month are in the past. </p><p>   \"We feel like we're finally on the road back to normal,\" he said. \"Now I'm eager for a little boring.\" </p><p></p>",
