  "title": "Vaccine Makers Shift Sights to New Strains",
  "text": "<p>When new strains were first identified in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil, the companies said they believed their shots would still protect against Covid-19. Then several studies indicated Covid-19 vaccines, while still working, aren't as effective against the variant that spread widely in South Africa.</p><p>Now Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax Inc. are designing new vaccines that would target variants of the virus, particularly the variant first identified in South Africa and now detected in other countries including the U.S.</p><p>On Wednesday, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC said it was partnering with Germany's CureVac NV in a deal worth up to 150 million euros, equivalent to $181 million, to develop Covid-19 vaccines that can tackle new variants. AstraZeneca PLC and partner University of Oxford said they plan to develop a new version of their vaccine that would target variants and could be available by autumn.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it would take over development and manufacturing of a potential Covid-19 treatment discovered by the Rockefeller University that has shown promise in fighting emerging mutations of the virus.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, is taking steps such as requiring smaller trials in order to accelerate the review and authorization of modified vaccines.</p><p>\"It highlights this arms race we have right now between getting enough people vaccinated and seeing the virus change,\" said Dr. C. Buddy Creech, director of Vanderbilt University's vaccine-research center.</p><p>The number of reported Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. rose to 3,530 Tuesday from 2,031 a day earlier, Johns Hopkins data show, but that was a decrease from 4,084 a week earlier. More than 32.7 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered as of Tuesday, including more than 6 million second shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>All viruses mutate. Early in the pandemic researchers expressed optimism the new coronavirus wouldn't change too significantly.</p><p>Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines, which were cleared for use in the U.S. in December before the variants were identified, appear to provide at least some protection against emerging strains in lab tests. Yet they weren't tested in humans exposed to new strains.</p><p>Vaccines from J&amp;J and Novavax recorded lower effectiveness levels in studies in South Africa that took place after the variant was identified there, compared with their performance in other regions. J&amp;J's shot, for example, was 57% effective in South Africa versus 72% in the U.S. J&amp;J plans to seek U.S. authorization for its vaccine this week.</p><p>While the current vaccines still work, it is important to start developing potential follow-on vaccines to be prepared for even more significant mutations that could evade current shots, companies and infectious-disease specialists say.</p><p>Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said during the 2021 Davos World Economic Forum last week that there is a \"high possibility\" a variant would emerge rendering Covid-19 vaccines ineffective.</p><p>\"It's very highly likely that one day that will happen,\" Mr. Bourla said, adding this isn't the case right now.</p><p>The new shots would be given as booster doses after a person gets one of the original vaccines, or companies could make new vaccines that target both the common viral strain and one or more of the new variants. It would be akin to the tweaks that companies make each year to seasonal influenza shots to target a specific flu strain.</p><p>Covid-19 vaccines could become a sizable market for drugmakers beyond the pandemic emergency if they have to be modified regularly.</p><p>Pfizer anticipates $15 billion in Covid-19 vaccine sales this year. Sales could prove durable, Mr. Bourla told analysts Tuesday, because people will likely need booster shots, either to stay protected against the virus or to combat emerging variants.</p><p>Pfizer said Tuesday it would study if using a booster shot provides additional protection, and it is tweaking its vaccine so it could guard against the strains found in Brazil and South Africa.</p><p>Pfizer hasn't decided whether it would test a new vaccine in people, but would aim to finish any study in 100 days, Mr. Bourla said. \"We don't want to develop a vaccine if we don't need to,\" he said. \"But we want to be able to develop it with the speed of light if there is a need.\"</p><p>Novavax is making some of the variant proteins for use in potential new vaccines, including the strain seen in South Africa, said Gregory Glenn, the company's head of R&amp;D.</p><p>Pfizer and Moderna said they can modify their vaccines to target new strains fairly quickly because they can simply insert the genetic code of a new virus strain into the same basic building blocks used to make their original vaccines.</p><p>It also shouldn't be difficult to tweak vaccines from J&amp;J, AstraZeneca and Novavax because of the new technologies used to make those shots,though the process could take slightly longer, said Robert Garry, professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane Medical School.</p><p>---</p><p>Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.</p>",
