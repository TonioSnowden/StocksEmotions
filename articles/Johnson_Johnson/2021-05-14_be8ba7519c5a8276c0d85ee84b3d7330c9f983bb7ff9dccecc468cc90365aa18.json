  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has pushed Latin America to accept shipments of unfrozen Covid-19 vaccines that some countries would be unable to fully deploy before they expire, according to the Pan-American Health Organization.<br><br>Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director at PAHO, told the Financial Times that J&amp;J was asking for doses to be shipped at refrigerator temperatures rather than frozen, as required by the World Health Organization.</p> <p>The WHO's emergency use authorisation for the J&amp;J vaccine stipulates that the shot must be delivered at <a href=\"https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/Package_leaflet_Janssen_29April2021.pdf\">between -25C and -15C</a>, a temperature at which it has a shelf life of two years. Once thawed, the doses must be used within three months. </p> <p>PAHO is the WHO's regional office for the Americas and is leading talks with J&amp;J for the delivery of vaccines under the multilateral Covax scheme.</p> <p>“Everybody wants to reach an agreement as soon as possible but we cannot accept vaccines that countries don't have time to use,” Barbosa said. “In certain circumstances you can accept 10 or 15 per cent of shipments with a shorter shelf life. But our recommendation is countries should only accept it at -20C.”</p> <p>Barbosa said J&amp;J had been “aggressive” in its procurement negotiations, and suggested that the company was seeking to offload doses that it could not otherwise use. “Maybe they have vaccines that were already unfrozen and want to deliver them through Covax,” he said.</p> <p>J&amp;J's adenovirus-based vaccine is initially stored frozen by the manufacturer and thawed before use. The single dose shot, which the company has committed to sell at cost during the pandemic, was eagerly anticipated. But concerns about rare side-effects, similar to the blood clots linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, have damped demand for the shot in the EU and the US.</p> <p>J&amp;J declined to answer specific questions about the negotiations. In a statement it said it had committed to allocate 500m doses to poorer nations and that its easily transportable, single-shot vaccine “demonstrated protection against multiple variants” and could be “a critical tool” in the fight against Covid.</p> <p>“We continue to work closely, collaboratively and with urgency with global health authorities and organisations and have a shared goal to bring an end to the pandemic,” the company said.</p> <p>A number of countries in Latin America, including Brazil, are battling challenging waves of Covid infection, and much of the developing world faces a crippling shortage of vaccines. </p> <p>Most countries in the region have capacity to store vaccines at about -20C, at least in major cities, because of their experience with polio vaccination campaigns, one person familiar with the matter said. Delivering frozen vaccines would mean governments had more time to ensure all doses were distributed and administered before they expired, the person said.</p> <p>PAHO remained “in talks” with J&amp;J and still hoped to resolve the issue before finalising the Covax contract next week, Barbosa said. Under the deal, agreed in principle in December, J&amp;J will deliver 200m doses to Covax for worldwide distribution in the second half of 2021.</p> <p>Barbosa added that vaccine procurement negotiations with many pharmaceutical groups had been challenging. The companies had often demanded onerous protections in the event of unforeseen side-effects and zero penalties for any manufacturing delays, he said.</p> <p>“The marketing is very imbalanced,” he said. “Companies are asking for things that in normal times would be unacceptable.”</p><p>Source: Donato Paolo Mancini in London and Nikou Asgari in New York 2021 'J&amp;J pushes Latin America to take unfrozen vaccines in Covax talks' FT.com 14 May.
