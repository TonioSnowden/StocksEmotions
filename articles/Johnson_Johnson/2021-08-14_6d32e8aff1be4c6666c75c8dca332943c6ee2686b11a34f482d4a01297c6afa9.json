  "text": "<p>\n  New Jersey's classic boardwalks and sandy beaches scream summer -- sometimes too loudly, when it seems people from all surrounding states are elbowing in to block the view. This summer, because of pandemic adaptations that are being carried into the future, some of the best attractions that were previously \"walk-in only\" (or don't walk in, because there's a wait) are operating by timed-entry or reservations, making them counterintuitively easier to visit for those who plan ahead. Here are three trips with a twist: a cultural tour of Cape May, a peek at the western Jersey wilderness and a jaunt up the Hudson River from vibrant Jersey City to Edgewater. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  History and Hawks in Cape May </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Beloved for big, cutwork-trimmed Victorian homes, good restaurants and a kitsch-free boardwalk, Cape May, which bills itself as America's first beach destination, increasingly offers more than sand, sea and sun. </p><p>\n  Timed Tricks: Cape May is closer to the Mason-Dixon Line than one might expect from New Jersey. Witness its new Harriet Tubman Museum, which opened for in-person visitors on Juneteenth, 2021. In the early 1850s, Tubman lived in Cape May, where she worked as a domestic laborer and cook to earn proceeds to fund her missions, which helped guide enslaved people from the southern states to freedom in the north. The museum inhabits the Howell House, the former parsonage of the Macedonia Baptist Church. Advance reservations are recommended. Hourly tickets are available through Eventbrite ($10, harriettubmanmuseum.org). Outside of town, a very different attraction is the Hawk Haven Vineyard &amp; Winery, whose coveted seating was previously first-come-first-served but who now takes reservations and voluntarily limits capacity. New Jersey increasingly makes high-quality wine, and Hawk Haven has what some consider one of the state's best wine programs. The reserved seating means more opportunity to talk to the staff about the wine, shorter lines at the food trucks that make appearances at peak times and clearer views of the band during performances at live-music summer series \"Rootstock.\" hawkhavenvineyard.com </p><p>\n  Outdoor Excursions: Birds touch down at the Cape May Bird Observatory after crossing the Delaware Bay; the whole area is a birding spot of national repute (njaudubon.org). </p><p>\n  Dining: Cape May's southern proximity rises again in the Caribbean-influenced, French New Orleans menu at 410 Bank Street, a restaurant in an 1800s carriage house (410 Bank St., Cape May, 410bankstreet.com). Nearby, the Mad Batter dishes up good casual food with front-porch people-watching (19 Jackson St., Cape May, madbatter.com).). A topless painted mermaid presides over the crafting of classic cocktails at the King Edward Bar (301 Howard St., Cape May, chalfonte.com). </p><p>\n  Sleeping: Pick from five accommodations, including an original Sears, Roebuck and Co. mail-order home and a 1700s whaling cottage, on the Beach Plum Farm, a Cape Resorts property known for its gourmet market (from $749, beachplumfarmcapemay.com). </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Nature by Design in Western New Jersey </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A concentration of green space and wealth in the state's central-western area makes for intriguing man-meets-nature passion projects. </p><p>\n  Timed Tricks: The Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton is the legacy of sculptor Seward Johnson, a Johnson + Johnson heir whose bronze re-creations of famous 19th-century paintings like Manet's \"Dejeuner Sur l'Herbe\" and Renoir's \"The Luncheon of the Boating Party\" express his ethos that art is for everyone. Tickets this summer to his 42-acre vision on the old New Jersey State Fairgrounds are by timed admission, better spreading out the crowds (groundsforsculpture.org). Afterward try a by-appointment-only wine-tasting at Unionville Vineyards, which uses only New Jersey-grown grapes and is known for balanced Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs and a success with Rhone blends that's not typical in New Jersey (unionvillevineyards.com). </p><p>\n  Outdoor Excursions: Even many New Jersey residents don't know about the Sourland Mountain Region, a 90-square-mile terrain mosaic whose extensive biking and hiking trail system travels though sun and shade, into forests with deer and fox and past old stone bridges and fields of sunflowers (sourland.org). After exploring the mountains, shop and dine in the historic town of Hopewell in the Sourland foothills, or at least check out the wares at the Brick Farm Market downtown. </p><p>\n  Dining: Sup in the pub-meets-fine-dining environs of the Brick Farm Tavern, a true farm-to-table restaurant located in the farmhouse in Hopewell (130 Hopewell Rocky Hill Rd., Hopewell, brickfarmtavern.com). </p><p>\n  Sleeping: The Federalist-style Inn at Glencairn and the stately Peacock Inn are two fine options, but the 100-room Chauncey Conference Center hidden outside of town on a large, wooded property is a more probable booking (from $149 a night, acc-chaunceyconferencecenter.com). </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Other Jersey Shore </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The urban view across the Hudson from Manhattan hardly says come hither, but tucked within its gritty landscape are infinity pools, contemporary art and a Jersey City reborn. </p><p>\n  Timed Tricks: SoJo Spa Club, in Edgewater, just across the Hudson from Columbia University, offers day passes by reservation to all the communal amenities in its spa complex -- the outdoor infinity pool with a Manhattan view, the outdoor hydrotherapy pool, the special indoor and outdoor baths (sojospaclub.com). Duly relaxed, head to Mana Contemporary, a 450,000-square-foot, 7-story art space in a former tobacco factory. Moishe Mana, the owner, calls Jersey City a \"Cinderella\" and claims the lower prices and potential for development allow creativity you'd never find in Manhattan these days. The museum is open only to those with reservations on Thursdays and Fridays, and to the general public on Saturdays through Aug. 28 (manacontemporary.com). </p><p>\n  Outdoor Excursions: From downtown Jersey City, take a CitiBike or the Light Rail to Liberty State Park, which has walking paths, waterfront strolling and a weirdly up-close view of the Statue of Liberty from the back (njparksandforests.org). Urban Paddle, headquartered on Jersey City's Marin Boulevard, runs a series of kayak tours, including one at night with LED lights (urban-paddle.com). </p><p>\n  Dining: Battello on the waterfront serves high-end Italian food (502 Washington Blvd., battellojc.com), while Razza Pizza Artigianale is hipper and more casual (275 Grove St., razzanj.com). Cellar 335, a tiki bar and speakeasy, also offers genuinely good food (335 Newark Ave., cellar335.com). The second location of Ani Ramen, a Jersey sensation, boasts an inset partner restaurant, Sushi by Bou, which offers a full bar (218 Newark Ave., aniramen.com). </p><p>\n  Sleeping: Drink in the water views from the higher floors at the Hyatt Regency in Jersey City (from $209 a night, hyatt.com). Or overnight at the SoJo Spa Club, whose suites have floor-to-ceiling windows, rice-paper dividers and Asian-inspired floor seating. Double rooms are more traditional but still serene (from $425 a night including spa passes for two, sojospaclub.com). </p><p></p>",
