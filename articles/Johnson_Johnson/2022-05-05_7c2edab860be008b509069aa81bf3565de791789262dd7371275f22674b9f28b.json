  "text": "<p>The FDA said it was making the move after confirming a total of 60 cases, including nine deaths, of the clotting condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, among the millions of people who got the J&amp;J shot.</p><p>The change will likely sharply scale back use of a vaccine that health authorities had once hoped would be a convenient option for many people, but has become a third choice for most people because of the emergence of the risk for the rare but life-threatening side effect.</p><p>In the U.S., roughly 17 million people have gotten the J&amp;J vaccine, compared with more than 202 million who received two doses of the authorized Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc., according to the CDC.</p><p>Due to the risk for the clotting condition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December recommended that patients opt for one of the other vaccines over the Johnson and Johnson shot.</p><p>\"Our action reflects our updated analysis of the risk of TTS following administration of this vaccine and limits the use of the vaccine to certain individuals,\" said Peter Marks, who leads the FDA division responsible for regulating vaccines.</p><p>J&amp;J said it has updated the fact sheet for its vaccine to increase awareness of the clotting condition. \"Data continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in adults, when compared with no vaccine,\" the company said.</p><p>U.S. health authorities in April 2021 paused the use of J&amp;J's vaccine to investigate the clotting-condition risk.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>FDA Limits Authorized Use of J&amp;J's Covid-19 Vaccine</p>",
