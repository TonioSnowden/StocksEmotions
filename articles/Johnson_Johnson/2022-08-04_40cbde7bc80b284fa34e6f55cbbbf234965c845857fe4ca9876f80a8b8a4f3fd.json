  "text": "<p>Zytiga, first marketed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, went generic in 2018. Pharmacies sell other Zytiga generics at list prices of nearly $3,000 a month, though with coupons the price can be around $200 for patients without insurance who pay with their own money, according to GoodRx, a website that tracks pharmacy prices and connects consumers to drug-discount coupons.</p><p>Civica will sell the abiraterone acetate drug through CivicaScript, a unit founded in 2020 to bring lower-priced versions of expensive generics on the market.</p><p>CivicaScript was created by a partnership of Civica, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other health insurers as a public-benefit corporation, a designation that requires companies to pursue both social good and shareholder value.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
