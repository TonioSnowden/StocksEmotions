  "title": "Merck Covid-19 Pill Cuts Risks  Of Hospitalizations and Death  ----  By Jared S. Hopkins and Betsy McKay",
  "text": "<p>   Merck &amp; Co. and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP said their experimental Covid-19 pill helped prevent high-risk people early in the course of the disease in a pivotal study from becoming seriously ill and dying, a big step toward providing the pandemic's first easy-to-use, at-home treatment. </p><p>   The pill cut the risk of hospitalization or death in study subjects with mild to moderate Covid-19 by about 50%, the companies said Friday. </p><p>   The drug, called molnupiravir, was performing so well in its late-stage trial that Merck and Ridgeback said they stopped enrolling subjects after discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. </p><p>   The results put molnupiravir on track potentially to be authorized by the end of the year and to finally provide an option for doctors who have spent the pandemic seeking a drug that infected people could easily take at home to prevent them from becoming hospitalized. </p><p>   Merck plans to ask the FDA to authorize the drug's use in the coming weeks, Chief Executive Rob Davis said. </p><p>   If cleared by regulators, the drug would be the first oral antiviral for Covid-19. Within five days of showing symptoms, people would take eight pills daily for five days, if they followed the same protocol used in the study. </p><p>   Molnupiravir would become a kind of Tamiflu for Covid-19, a medication that can be dispensed to patients when they first develop symptoms, slowing the spread of the virus in the body and potentially preventing people from becoming seriously ill. </p><p>   \"The ability to take what is a devastating disease like Covid-19 and potentially make it a manageable situation through what is a very convenient round of administration, which is an oral pill you can take at home, has important implications for the ability to manage the ongoing pandemic,\" Mr. Davis said. </p><p>   Together with vaccines, the pill, if authorized, would help transform Covid-19 from a deadly pandemic disease that overwhelms hospitals to a treatable illness as it becomes endemic in the population. \"This will help get to that endemic level and maintain that level,\" said Gabor Kelen, director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine. </p><p>   Doctors expressed concern, however, the pill's promising results might encourage people who are vaccine hesitant to feel emboldened about not getting vaccinated. </p><p>   \"Vaccination is still, first and foremost, the most effective and least risky thing that you can do,\" said John Mellors, chair of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh. </p><p>   Merck and Ridgeback reported the findings in a news release after an early look at results from the study, which is scheduled to finish in November. The results haven't been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. </p><p>   Molnupiravir works by attacking the portion of the virus that helps it reproduce. </p><p>   The companies said the rate of side effects in study subjects who got molnupiravir and those who got a placebo was similar, though they didn't say in their news release whether the drug was found in the study to be safe. Mr. Davis, however, said he was confident in the drug's safety profile. </p><p>   The drug appeared effective against currently circulating Covid-19 variants, including highly contagious Delta, according to the companies. </p><p>   The results position Kenilworth, N.J.-based Merck to play a larger role in responding to the pandemic after several setbacks. After its two experimental vaccines failed in testing, Merck agreed to help make Johnson &amp; Johnson's shot. Merck also halted development of an experimental drug it acquired through a $425 million purchase. </p><p>   Molnupiravir could generate $10 billion in sales cumulatively through 2025, given potential for stockpiling and its potential for preventing Covid-19, which is still being studied, according to Daina Graybosch, an analyst at Leerink LLC. Merck shares rose more than 8% on the news. </p><p>   Merck said it expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of the year. If authorized, Merck would begin shipping doses fairly quickly, Mr. Davis said. </p><p>   The U.S. has agreed to pay Merck $1.2 billion for 1.7 million courses of treatment, should regulators green light use of molnupiravir. </p><p>   Merck said it has licensing agreements with generic manufacturers to provide the drug to low-income countries. </p><p>   Vaccines are the main weapon fighting the pandemic, but doctors and health authorities have long looked for drugs that can help keep people who do get infected from developing severe illness and needing hospitalization. Nearly two years into the pandemic, however, the drug options are limited. Remdesivir, from Gilead Sciences Inc., is the only antiviral fully approved by the FDA but is used only to treat hospitalized patients. </p><p>   The FDA has cleared antibody drugs made by companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC and its partner Vir Biotechnology Inc. for people with mild to moderate Covid-19 who aren't hospitalized. The drugs reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by at least 70% in their trials, a higher efficacy rate than molnupiravir. Yet the antibody drugs are more complicated than swallowing a pill, requiring an intravenous infusion. </p><p>   One of the more effective drugs against Covid-19, a steroid named dexamethasone, is for very sick patients. </p><p>   The Merck-Ridgeback late-stage, or Phase 3, study enrolled more than 1,400 people who were at high risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19. To enroll, participants had to be unvaccinated. About half received an 800-milligram dose of molnupiravir twice a day for five days, with the other participants receiving a placebo. </p><p>   High risk was defined as having at least one characteristic associated with severe disease or death, such as old age, obesity or diabetes. Treatment began within five days after the participants developed Covid-19 symptoms. </p><p></p>",
