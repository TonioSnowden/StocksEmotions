  "text": "<p>   About 85% of vaccine candidates fail in trials, and those that succeed have historically taken 10 to 15 years to develop. It seems like an incredible stroke of luck and science that we have so many Covid-19 vaccines so soon. But it's more than that. Credit years of research and investment by drug makers, as well as government collaboration during the pandemic, which Mr. Gorsky hopes will outlast the pandemic. </p><p>   \"I think this is a golden moment, not only for Johnson &amp; Johnson, but the biopharmaceutical industry,\" he says. \"We fundamentally believe that having a market-based, innovation-based, biopharmaceutical as well as a medical-technology environment, is critical long term to produce the best overall outcomes for healthcare.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Finley is a member of the Journal's editorial board. </p><p></p>",
