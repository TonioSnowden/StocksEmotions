  "text": "<p>\"We do not want to be in litigation for years on this, spending money and resources while people are dying,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said Thursday. \"We want to get fair settlements now. Others need to follow suit.\"</p><p>States have been negotiating since 2019 with the nation's three largest drug distributors, McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health Inc., as well as drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson. The companies have publicly disclosed that they have set aside a collective $26 billion for the deal, most of it to be paid over 18 years, but no final agreement has been reached.</p><p>In news conferences Thursday, attorneys general said they hoped the McKinsey deal would provide momentum for a bigger settlement, if others facing litigation follow the consulting company's lead.</p><p>\"These other companies are not acting smartly, if they don't do the same,\" said Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.</p><p>Representatives for the distributors declined to comment. Johnson &amp; Johnson pointed to an October statement that it had increased its settlement offer to $5 billion and that terms were still being finalized.</p><p>The swift settlement negotiations with McKinsey were spurred by information about the consulting firm's work that became public during OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP's chapter 11 bankruptcy, said state lawyers in Vermont and North Carolina.</p><p>McKinsey Global Managing Partner Kevin Sneader said the firm chose to resolve the matter to provide support to communities across the U.S. addressing the opioid crisis.\"We deeply regret that we did not adequately acknowledge the tragic consequences of the epidemic unfolding in our communities,\" he said. The agreement, like most civil settlements, didn't require McKinsey to admit to wrongdoing.</p><p>The state agreements won't block potential legal claims that Purdue could bring against McKinsey related to the years of work it provided the company. Bankrupt companies sometimes sue former advisers over advice that caused management to breach duties owed to company stakeholders.</p><p>The bankruptcy documents showed how McKinsey advised Purdue to increase OxyContin sales, including suggesting Purdue's sales team make more calls to health-care providers who wrote the highest volume of prescriptions. The company retained McKinsey in 2013 to increase OxyContin revenue shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved labeling for a reformulated version of the opioid painkiller that is harder to abuse. The consulting firm did work for Purdue between 2004 and 2019, say complaints filed by states Thursday.</p><p>The deals announced Thursday call for $558 million to be shared by 47 states, the District of Columbia and several territories, with $15 million going to a national attorney-general organization.</p>",
