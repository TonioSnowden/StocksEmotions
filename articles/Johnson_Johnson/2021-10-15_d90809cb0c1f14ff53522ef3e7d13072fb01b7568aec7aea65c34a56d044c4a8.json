  "text": "<p>The FDA could decide on whether to clear a J&amp;J booster within days.</p><p>The committee members, meeting virtually online, opted not to take a vote on whether it would be better for people to wait at least six months after the first dose to get the J&amp;J booster shot. Panel members said the evidence was too limited for whether to wait six months for the booster.</p><p>J&amp;J had requested that the FDA authorization recommend people wait six months, though they could get the booster as early as two months after the first dose. The company presented evidence showing varying effects when the booster is given between two and six months after the first dose.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Covid-19 Booster Shot Endorsed by FDA Advisers</p>",
