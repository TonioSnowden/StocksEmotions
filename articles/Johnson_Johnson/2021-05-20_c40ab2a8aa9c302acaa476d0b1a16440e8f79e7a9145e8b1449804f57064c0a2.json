  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, ambassadors from the 27 European Union member states agreed to a proposal that would re-open their borders to fully vaccinated travelers from countries deemed safe, if the final shots were taken two weeks before travel and were from providers approved by the World Health Organization or the EU's medicines regulator.</p><p>EU officials have indicated the U.S. will soon be added to the safe list. Vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson are all allowed.</p><p>The proposal still needs to be approved by national leaders. Once approved, the EU-wide agreement is expected to come into effect very soon, according to an EU spokesperson.</p><p>Which EU countries are opening their borders?</p><p>Some member states are already admitting Americans, with a hodgepodge of requirements. Greece currently allows entry without quarantine to Americans who have been fully vaccinated (14 days past the final dose), or can show that they recovered from Covid in the last 9 months, or have a negative PCR test that was conducted within 72 hours before arrival. Italy is also already open to Americans without quarantine if you're on one of the new \"Covid tested flights\" -- select flights operated by Delta, American, United and Alitalia that require all passengers to take three Covid tests, one 72 hours before departure, another at the airport before boarding and a third upon arrival.</p><p>Other countries in the EU are expected to open their borders soon, following the European Commission's recommendations, with a few exceptions.</p><p>Is the U.K. open to tourists?</p><p>As the U.K. is no longer part of the EU, its standards won't apply. Currently, the U.K. has the world divided into Red, Amber and Green countries. The U.S. is on the Amber list: Visitors from the U.S. need to test negatively for Covid-19 no more than 72 hours before departing, and twice, on the second and eighth days, after arrival. A 10-day quarantine is still required, though after five days, you can take an additional Covid test to get out early.</p><p>What about other European countries that aren't part of the EU?</p><p>Switzerland, Norway and Liechtenstein are all expected to follow the European Commission's recommendations, as is Iceland, which already opened to vaccinated tourists in March.</p><p>If I'm vaccinated, do I still need to get a Covid-19 test before I come back to the U.S.?</p><p>Yes. Current requirements by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for all air passengers coming to the U.S., including U.S. citizens and fully vaccinated people to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test result taken no more than three days before travel or documentation of recovery from Covid-19 in the past three months before they board a flight to the U.S.</p><p>What are the safest places to travel in Europe right now Covid-wise?</p><p>Traveling to an area with a high infection rate can potentially put you at more risk of catching the virus, even if you have been vaccinated. The presence of the virus varies widely between European countries. France, for example, now has a 14-day case infection rate per 100,000 inhabitants of about 415. That compares with 249 for Italy, 269 for Greece, 274 for Germany and 25 for Iceland. But those numbers are in flux.</p><p>Are some countries still under curfew? Are museums, shops and restaurants operating as usual?</p><p>Some countries still have curfews, but in many cases there are plans to phase out the restrictions unless there is a significant rise in the infection rate. Italy, for example, this week reduced a longstanding nationwide curfew to begin at 11 p.m. rather than an hour earlier. That will be moved to midnight on June 7 and then erased altogether on June 21. France also has a nationwide curfew, which starts at 9 p.m. Countries with curfews in at least some areas include Germany, Spain and Greece.</p><p>Shops, museums and restaurants in most countries are open though restrictions still apply. On Wednesday, France began allowing cafes, bars and restaurants to serve clients at outside tables. Many museums, including the Louvre in Paris, reopened this week.</p>",
