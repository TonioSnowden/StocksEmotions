  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>News this morning that UK inflation had hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e777a2d1-bc5c-4e01-8605-2be0682aad5e\">new 40-year high</a> will fuel the simmering discontent among British workers suffering from a severe cost of living crisis and pile pressure on the Bank of England for a strong response.</p> <p>The bigger than expected increase in the year to June of 9.4 per cent, the highest in the G7, was driven by sharp rises in the prices of food, up 9.8 per cent, and petrol prices, up 18.1 pence per litre, the biggest jump since records began in 1990.</p> <p>The situation is expected to get much worse in October when recent wholesale prices for energy feed through and the government's price cap ratchets up.</p> <p>The pressure on the country's businesses was highlighted by separate data showing factory gate prices rising at a 45-year high of 16.5 per cent.</p> <p>Bank of England governor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef6b1b89-b5b6-4195-b088-7f8841412a54\">Andrew Bailey</a> said yesterday that interest rates could rise by half a percentage point next month as part of its “absolute priority” in getting inflation back down its 2 per cent target rate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the summer of discontent among the UK workforce continued to grow as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f270c3e2-2731-407e-9ef5-de6a11a085a4\">Royal Mail postal staff</a> announced what could be the biggest strike of the summer so far. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81209475-7e50-449a-8167-2786984417b2\">Public sector workers</a> have not taken kindly to the government's offer of a below-inflation pay rise of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce5d7629-b7bf-46dd-bb7a-ff177f1f4ca5\">5 per cent</a>. Their response has ranged from “pitiful”, “disappointing” and “wholly inadequate” to a “grave mis-step” and “a kick in the teeth”.</p> <p>They gained further ammo from official data that showed private sector pay rising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d819ba3b-d886-42dd-9be9-511134fc69d2\">five times faster</a> than in the public sector. Several businesses are also offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e85f4f3-939d-4f91-9a5e-10b297dbbf85\">pay boosts and bonuses</a> to help mitigate the surging cost of living. </p> <p>Despite this, Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said today that the government had to hold down public sector pay to prevent a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf4d3f1b-97dc-4d11-8bf8-e0f6fcb57c96#post-bc908527-ba9b-46d0-9b5c-3bbb085ec72f\">replay of the 1970s</a>” citing Margaret Thatcher in arguing “there is no alternative”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88057939-af8a-4484-a4b4-8208ba873c9c\">Nadhim Zahawi</a>, in his first speech as the country's new (and possibly temporary) chancellor, yesterday signalled a continuation of the fiscal policies of his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/460247bb-10da-491b-b98a-4a13381ef8ab\">Rishi Sunak</a>, prioritising the taming of inflation and ruling out borrowing for tax cuts. </p> <p>Sunak, it was confirmed this afternoon, will face Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, in a run-off among Conservative members over the summer to become party leader and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c7e970b-8630-41d8-adae-73ff1b9c78e0\">prime minister</a>.</p> <p><em>Are big corporate profits to blame for inflation?

Speculation is growing that the ECB could opt for a bigger than originally expected rise of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/160e24da-946e-4652-a69c-369fa3b68172\">50 basis points</a>.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>UK ministers have overridden their own planning inspector to approve a new <strong>nuclear power station</strong> on the site of an existing plant at Sizewell in Suffolk as it seeks to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11ca7193-f7d8-496f-bb90-d3270b2cf874\">bolster domestic energy sources</a>.

The <strong>IMF</strong> warned yesterday that an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd0336e7-1346-4491-a9d5-cc3f9fd0014f\">embargo on Russian gas</a> would lead to severe recessions in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Italy if countries began to hoard supplies.

Ukraine's agriculture minister <strong>Mykola Solskyi</strong> told the FT that if the blockade remained it would mean <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21065943-4b8c-4f22-a91a-806b5d571860\">two-thirds less wheat</a> being planted this year, worsening the global food crisis.

The FT editorial board said Beijing's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dee81e2-9be1-430e-9b35-ae3651455996\">zero-Covid policy</a> risks weakening already frail economic growth, not only in China but across the world.</p> <p>The <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> has upped the number of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ea6f899-bb55-478f-a14a-a6dd37aae724\">oil exploration blocks</a> it will auction next week from 16 to 27 in response to calls for increased crude production following the Ukraine war.</p> <p>The two-year surge in <strong>house prices</strong> in several advanced economies is likely to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64487d95-f58c-4131-b27e-e7a3b68dfdce\">come to an end</a> as the era of low interest rates passes. Some could even experience falls in prices as their central banks plump for big rate rises, especially those with a high level of home ownership and use of adjustable rate mortgages. UK prices in the meantime continue to surge: official data showed an increase of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf4d3f1b-97dc-4d11-8bf8-e0f6fcb57c96#post-58f767be-058f-4f76-b6db-393d4976c594\">12.8 per cent</a> in the year to May.</p> <p>The closure of <strong>Australia's borders</strong> during the pandemic starved the country of the backpackers and temporary workers that normally staff hotels and bars and pick fruit and vegetables. The combined effect of the slowdown in immigration and a booming economy has left almost <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a39bea1f-ed87-45c4-a762-b59121115e9f\">half a million jobs unfilled</a>. The government has launched a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d0b0a8f-ef8e-4a2e-aa8f-ee9207242834\">review of the country's central bank</a> for its tardiness in implementing rates rises and its “embarrassing” forecasting.</p> <p>Protests over the cost of living have now reached <strong>Panama</strong>, as the traditionally stable Central American nation experiences its worst unrest since the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/951be09d-5a22-4de7-8c44-8fe11deb5cd6\">fall of Manuel Noriega</a> in 1989.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>Business confidence</strong> in the global economy continues to fall. US fund managers have reached a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22a53a57-1237-422c-a2d7-c7abeab1d901\">“dire level” of pessimism</a>, cutting their allocations to shares to the lowest level since the financial crisis, as the outlook for company profits dims. In the UK, a survey showed 76 per cent of FTSE 350 businesses expected the global economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e24ebb-034c-4477-805c-4d6703abac5e\">to deteriorate</a>, the lowest level of confidence in a decade.</p> <p>Furniture retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40137940-0e21-46a1-9102-5958ff99ba40\">Made.com</a> joined those UK companies slashing their forecasts as consumer confidence dives. It's only a matter of time before the same happens to non-consumer sectors, as is already on display in the US earnings season, writes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daa3d376-e8ce-4b66-9a95-f81355a79085\">Cat Rutter Pooley</a>.</p> <p>Some more signs of the times in the <strong>UK food sector</strong>.

The Lex column said profitability remained a concern but Netflix's ability to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/780ac63a-f389-458b-9de7-a696a2f1d948\">drive the social conversation</a> should not be underestimated.</p> <p><strong>Airbus</strong> chief Guillaume Faury said the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e407842-87d0-4d48-935a-f9419460cfd7\">supply chain crisis</a> would last until next year as manufacturers struggle to increase production and businesses face shortages of raw materials and components.
