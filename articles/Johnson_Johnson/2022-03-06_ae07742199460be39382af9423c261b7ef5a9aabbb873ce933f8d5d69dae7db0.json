  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said it was negotiating partnership deals with two Chinese companies as it taps into a biotech boom in the country driven by a surge in private investment and government support, according to a senior executive.</p> <p>The talks with the two companies, which J&amp;J declined to name, follow the US drugmaker's successful collaboration with Legend Biotech, a company founded in China in 2014 but now headquartered in New Jersey. The companies worked together on a breakthrough cell-based cancer therapy that was approved by US regulators last week.</p> <p>Several other large US pharma groups, including Eli Lilly, AbbVie and Amgen have clinched similar agreements over the past two years as western drugmakers increasingly seek to license high-potential therapies from Chinese partners to sell in other markets.</p> <p>Peter Lebowitz, head of J&amp;J's global oncology division, told the Financial Times that “before 2015, in the early days”, Chinese biotech companies were focused on formulating “slightly better versions of existing” drugs, adding: “Now though, in China there is true innovation.” </p> <p>“We are always looking for opportunities in China but there are a couple now that we are really going to push to close in on potential deals,” he said. </p> <p>Western drugmakers clinched a dozen major licensing deals with Chinese biotechs carrying a median deal value of $900mn between July 2020 and July 2021, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/the-dawn-of-china-biopharma-innovation\">according</a> to McKinsey, the management consultancy. </p> <p>The market value of listed biopharma groups from China on the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Nasdaq exchanges has surged from $3bn in 2016 to $240bn today, McKinsey said — despite a sharp correction in global biotech stocks in 2021.</p> <p>Bruce Liu, who leads the life sciences division for China at the consultancy firm Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, said the country's central role in the drug supply chain — it produces around one-third of the world's active pharmaceutical ingredients — has helped it forge a new role as an innovative drug hub.</p> <p>Beijing has offered incentives for Chinese scientists overseas to return to support domestic businesses, said Liu. Meanwhile, a change in listing rules at the Hong Kong Exchange in 2018 — which allowed pharma companies without revenue to access public capital — had led to an “explosion” in biotech investment, he added. </p> <p>Western drugmakers have pivoted towards China despite geopolitical tensions, logistical hurdles caused by Covid-19 and concerns expressed by US regulators over the quality of some drug approval applications that rely solely on China-based clinical trials.</p> <p>Last month a US Food and Drug Administration committee voted against recommending approval of a lung cancer treatment developed by Innovent Biologics and Eli Lilly because the trial was conducted in China on a population that is less racially diverse than in the US.</p> <p>Ying Huang, Legend Biotech chief executive, said the FDA wanted to ensure clinical trial data was appropriate for the US population. He said J&amp;J and Legend had consulted extensively with the FDA for its trials, which initially took place in China but later expanded to the US and Japan. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>“We are proud to be the trailblazer to bring some breakthrough science discovery in China and develop that in the US,” said Huang, </p> <p>He said a surging investment in the Chinese biotech sector is generating scientific breakthroughs and opportunities for expansion to the US, the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>The J&amp;J/Legend treatment, Carvykti, is a Car-T therapy, which works by extracting a patient's blood cells, re-engineering them in a lab so they can identify and destroy cancer and then reinserting them into the body. </p> <p>China is conducting more clinical trials in the Car-T field than any other country, with 492 registered studies, compared with 362 in the US and 274 in Europe, according to a database compiled by Beacon Targeted Therapies.</p> <p>Rod Wong, chief investment officer at RTW, a New York-based healthcare fund with some China investments said the Legend Biotech white blood cell cancer therapy was a “globally competitive therapy” and part of a “first wave of [Chinese] innovation” focused on cancer treatments. </p> <p>He expects Chinese pharma companies to produce other types of innovative drugs that tackle other health problems that disproportionately affect the country's domestic population such as cardiovascular disease. </p> <p>Bruce Levine, a professor of cancer gene therapy at University of Pennsylvania, said the pace at which Chinese-discovered therapies entered the US market would depend on clinical trial conduct and when stringent Covid-19 restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>“In the US we have an established regulatory authority and we have standards of quality. In China there are some very good hospitals . . . and then there's a lot hospitals that are not so good. They don't keep track of their patients,” he said. </p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Jamie Smyth in New York and Eleanor Olcott in London 2022 'J&amp;J targets Chinese biotech deals as western pharma groups look east  ' FT.com 6 March.
