  "text": "<p>US president Joe Biden urged Americans to “wait their turn” to receive<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96940d53-46ca-4887-bf3f-193563052947#post-eb1e00f2-8d2e-4cf5-ba0e-d588c93c35b9\"> Covid-19 vaccine booster shots</a>, as his administration pressed ahead with a scaled-back plan offering third Pfizer jabs to elderly Americans, frontline workers and adults with high-risk medical conditions.</p> <p>“We're looking to the time when we're going to be able to expand the booster shots, basically across the board. So I would just say, it would&#xa0;be better to wait your turn in line,” the 78-year-old US president said in remarks from the White House on Friday, adding that he would get his own booster as soon as he could.&#xa0;</p> <p>Biden has been on the defensive about his handling of the Covid crisis as the Delta variant spread across the country, primarily among the unvaccinated in recent months. This has forced the president to put <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9eb2e1f-965f-462c-bfcd-ca4339cb5ca9\">pressure on federal workers and private businesses to join the vaccination campaign</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We made so much progress during the past eight months in this pandemic. And now we face a critical moment. We have the tools. We have the plan. We just have to finish the job together as one nation,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Biden administration has come under fire for announcing in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd4d20ab-e6d5-4486-9219-7eae2822ce5b#post-5ae345b0-1a39-4f42-ab1b-0bef06e024bd\">August that a broad booster campaign for everyone over the age of 16 could begin this week</a>, only to see it scaled back by health officials and regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p>“The decision of which booster shot to give, when to start the shot, and who will get them is left to the scientists and the doctors. That's what happened here,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>An FDA <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c95611ae-3c2d-46ae-a196-e790a5767537\">advisory panel declined to endorse BioNTech/Pfizer boosters</a> for everyone over age 16, and instead recommended a third dose for a more limited group of older and at-risk individuals. The FDA heeded that recommendation on Wednesday night, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf854a4b-39c2-4e86-87c4-acb211282a75\">authorising</a> a third dose for people aged 65 and over and adults at high risk of severe Covid-19 as well as those working in jobs where they are frequently exposed to the virus. </p> <p>The vaccine committee advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday backed boosters for some of those groups, but rejected endorsing a third jab for those working in jobs with high risk of exposure to Covid, including retail and healthcare workers. </p> <p>Late on Thursday, Rochelle Walensky, head of the CDC, overruled the panel. In a statement, she said people working in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/009ec055-f18f-4cd8-8334-bd9e4505b8bf\">jobs with high risk of Covid exposure “may receive a booster” </a>based on their individual benefit and risk situation.</p> <p>“This aligns with the FDA's booster authorisation and makes these groups eligible for a booster shot,” she said.</p> <p>The split between the CDC expert panel and its director underscore the ongoing debate in the scientific community about the benefits of an extra dose versus potential risks of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2068f628-650c-42d8-a8e6-c16a1e401884\">rare heart-related side effects</a>, especially in younger people. </p> <p>“The science shows that we have a really effective vaccine and we aren't making a decision for the unvaccinated, we're making a decision for the vaccinated,” said Helen Talbot, associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University and a member of the CDC panel. </p> <p>“I don't think we have the data in these younger age groups to make a decision for the booster dose,” she added.</p> <p>Third doses will be available six months after full vaccination only for people who initially received BioNTech/Pfizer jabs. Several scientists questioned the logistics and fairness of this and voiced frustrations about the scarcity of data on a booster dose of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p> <p>“I just don't understand how we can say to people 65 years and up ‘you are at severe risk of hospitalisation . . . but only half of you can protect yourselves right now',” said Sarah Long, paediatrics professor at Drexel University College of Medicine.</p> <p>The group debated the extent to which people should be able to assess their own eligibility because boosters can be administered based on a person's own attestation, which has allowed some people to receive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c140ede-1b13-4b7f-ae8e-5a0a709b64be\">unauthorised boosters</a>.</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York and James Politi in Washington 2021 'Biden urges Americans to ‘wait their turn' for booster jabs' FT.com 24 September.
