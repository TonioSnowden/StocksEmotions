  "title": "U.S. News:  Pfizer, BioNTech Ask FDA to  Expand Booster to All Adults  ----  By Jared S. Hopkins and Stephanie Armour",
  "text": "<p>   Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE asked U.S. health regulators to expand the authorization of their Covid-19 booster to people as young as 18 years old, as the government explores expanding access to extra doses. </p><p>   The application opens the door for authorization of the extra dose potentially before the end of the year, which could provide millions of people with another layer of security as winter drives many indoors where the risk of transmission is higher. </p><p>   The Food and Drug Administration in September cleared a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adults who are 65 and older or are at risk of severe disease and death, including because of their jobs or where they live. </p><p>   The government has also cleared booster shots ofvaccines from Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and is backing mixing-and-matching the extra doses. </p><p>   The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is given in two doses three weeks apart. The companies have said the additional dose would increase antibody levels that had dropped over time following the second shot. </p><p>   The higher antibody levels will help protect people against symptomatic Covid-19, the companies have said. </p><p>   Government officials and health experts say the boosters will help the U.S. stay ahead of the pandemic, after cases and hospitalizations have fallen following the Delta variant's spread across the country over the summer. </p><p>   Ahead of formal company requests, the Biden administration has been looking at expanding the use of boosters from J&amp;J and Moderna as well as Pfizer and BioNTech to all adults, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The FDA has been compiling scientific and epidemiological data, as well as safety information, on expanding access to boosters and should make decisions in coming weeks, the people said. </p><p>   The information would be provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which makes recommendations on who should receive a Covid-19 booster shot. </p><p>   Partly driving the administration's deliberations, one of the people said, is that the current recommendations may be confusing people who are delaying boosters because they mistakenly believe they are ineligible. </p><p>   Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said Tuesday that annual booster shots are likely and that the protection from the vaccine's third shot will probably fall after about a year. \"It looks like that it will last for a year,\" he said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank. </p><p>   Since the FDA began authorizing boosters, more than 24 million people have received the extra doses, including more than 14 million people who received Pfizer-BioNTech's, according to the CDC. </p><p>   Pfizer and BioNTech said last month that researchers found the booster shot was 95.6% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in a study that enrolled more than 10,000 subjects 16 years and older. </p><p>   The additional dose was safe and tolerable, and consistent with what was known about the vaccine, the companies said. </p><p>   The companies conducted the study while the Delta variant was prevalent, suggesting additional shots help protect against the contagious strain. </p><p>   The results were the first from a study testing whether an extra dose of a Covid-19 vaccine provides protection in people. They haven't yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
