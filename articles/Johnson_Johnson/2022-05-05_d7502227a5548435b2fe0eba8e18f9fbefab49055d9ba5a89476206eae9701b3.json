  "title": "Search for Yield Pushes Investors Into Dividend-Paying Stocks; Shares offering dividends race past S&P 500, growth stocks in 2022",
  "text": "<p>They took a hit Thursday as the broader market tumbled, but have held on to their lead for 2022. The iShares Core High Dividend exchange-traded fund, which tracks 75 such stocks, is up 3.9% this year. That puts the fund far ahead of the S&amp;P 500, which is down 13% in 2022.</p><p>The fund includes stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corp., which has a dividend yield of 3.9%; Johnson &amp; Johnson, which has a yield of 2.6%; and Coca-Cola Co. with a yield of 2.7%. All three are beating the market for the year.</p><p>What is unusual about this year's rally in dividend-paying stocks is that it is the opposite of what market convention says happens when interest rates rise. Usually, investors say, dividend-paying stocks do poorly in a rising-rate environment. That is because rates typically go up when the economy is growing. In boom times, investors tend to forgo the steady cash payments of bondlike stocks in favor of companies that have the potential to deliver bigger profits down the line.</p><p>But this time around, a different dynamic is at play. Interest rates have risen swiftly, not because investors are betting on an economic surge, but because accelerating inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to act quickly to try to rein in price pressures. Some investors worry the Fed's interest-rate increases may even tip the economy into recession.</p><p>That has drawn investors into shares of big dividend payers, which promise to deliver a steady stream of cash in the near term. A bonus? Many dividend payers are in industries like utilities, telecommunications, and consumer staples, which consumers tend to rely on year-round, regardless of the economic environment. That has made them especially attractive to investors who are worried the Fed won't be able to combat inflation without significantly raising unemployment.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Where are you finding shelter from volatility in the market? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"I don't want high risk. I want a cereal company with a dividend that I know is coming,\" said Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager and head of multiasset solutions at Federated Hermes.</p><p>Froot Loops maker Kellogg Co., which has a dividend yield of 3.3%, is up 9% this year.</p><p>Mr. Chiavarone said Federated Hermes has been recommending that clients take an overweight position in dividend-paying stocks. It is the call they have the highest conviction in this year, he added.</p><p>In recent weeks, analysts at Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have also issued recommendations for clients to invest in dividend-paying stocks.</p><p>The rise in dividend-paying stocks comes as nearly every other part of the market has fallen this year. For years, investors had piled into shares of fast-growing companies, wagering the premium they paid for them would be justified by their better-than-average earnings. That was especially true in an environment where interest rates had fallen to historic lows, making bonds look less attractive.</p><p>But investors have largely shied away from growth stocks this year. The S&amp;P 500 technology sector is down 19%. The communication services sector, which includes technology-driven companies such as Netflix Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., is down 24%.</p><p>Besides growth stocks, small-caps, bonds, and value stocks—shares that trade at low valuations relative to their earnings—have also fallen this year.</p><p>\"Part of the popularity of the high-dividend players has been the 'nowhere to hide' narrative in the markets this year,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corporation.</p><p>Another reason dividend-paying stocks are doing so well?</p><p>It has nothing to do with the dividends themselves. It is that many dividend payers are energy companies, whose shares have jumped this year as crude prices have taken off.</p><p>Oil-and-gas companies, for instance, make up around 7.4% of the Vanguard High Dividend ETF, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Capital. That has been a boost to the fund in a year where the S&amp;P 500 energy sector has risen 45%.</p><p>After a good run, some investors who had put money in dividend-paying stocks say they are looking for bargains elsewhere.</p><p>Heading into this year, Verdence Capital Advisors had an overweight position in value stocks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at the firm. Ms. Horneman said the firm had bet that after years of lagging behind growth stocks, value stocks—many of which are dividend payers—would enjoy a rebound as economic growth started to show signs of slowing.</p><p>The market reversal has gone so far, though, that Ms. Horneman said the firm is no longer looking to shift more money into the bet.</p><p>\"In fact, we're looking at areas of the market that aren't dividend payers that may be overpricing pessimism,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>Search for Yield Pushes Investors Into Dividend-Paying Stocks</p>",
