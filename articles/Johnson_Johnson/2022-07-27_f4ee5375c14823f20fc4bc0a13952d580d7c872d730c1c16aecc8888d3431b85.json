  "title": "Earplug Plaintiff Lawyers Attack 3M Bankruptcy Backstop; 3M's bankrupt military earplug units cite an intercompany agreement as grounds to shield the parent company from mass litigation",
  "text": "<p>Aearo said the agreement, as well as shared insurance coverage, provides a basis for extending its automatic litigation stay to its parent company 3M, which is also named a defendant in the earplug cases.</p><p>Injury lawyers have opposed extending the automatic stay to 3M, saying in court papers the parent should put itself into bankruptcy if it wants the litigation pause that comes with chapter 11.</p><p>Sasha Gurvitz, a lawyer representing the injury claimants, said in Wednesday's hearing that Aearo shouldn't be permitted to \"manufacture indemnity obligations on the eve of bankruptcy\" and then cite those indemnity obligations as a reason why lawsuits against 3M should be put on hold.</p><p>David Bernick, a lawyer representing Aearo, denied that the indemnity obligations were manufactured and said the agreement was reached immediately before the bankruptcy filing to ensure the company had access to funding from 3M for its chapter 11 case.</p><p>Under the agreement, 3M has offered $240 million to fund Aearo's chapter 11 case and $1 billion toward settling the litigation. In exchange, Aearo and its related subsidiaries agreed to indemnify its parent company for all ear plug injury claims as well as related defense costs.</p><p>\"The indemnity is the flip side of the [3M] contribution,\" Mr. Bernick said.</p><p>Judge Jeffrey Graham in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Indianapolis is scheduled next month to consider Aearo's request to pause litigation against 3M.</p><p>Requests by bankrupt subsidiaries to extend a chapter 11 pause in litigation to their parent companies have become common in recent years. Johnson &amp; Johnson won a court ruling earlier this year halting talc-related litigation against it after it pushed those liabilities into a new subsidiary that carried them into bankruptcy.</p><p>3M and Aearo have said the chapter 11 case is intended to equitably and efficiently compensate injury claimants. The company and its affiliates have been named as defendants in what Aearo has said is the largest multidistrict litigation in U.S. history.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
