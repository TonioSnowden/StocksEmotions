  "title": "Highly Vaccinated South Korea Can't Slow Down Covid-19; More than 80% of the country has received two doses, but officials are now reinstituting restrictions they had vowed to relax",
  "text": "<p>In recent days, health officials accelerated the timetable for adults to get a booster shot, down to three months from a prior wait of five months. Teens now must get vaccinated by February or face penalties. Starting next month, one South Korean city will use facial-recognition technology to automate contact tracing, as a way to speed up investigations.</p><p>Then on Thursday, South Korean officials pivoted back to clampdowns from earlier in the pandemic. Most businesses will soon have to close by 9 p.m., including restaurants, bars and cafes. Private gatherings are limited to four vaccinated people.</p><p>\"I am sorry that we have had to once again strengthen antivirus measures,\" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said.</p><p>The retrenchment comes even as South Korea boasts one of the highest vaccination rates among wealthy countriesâ€”most of whom administered second vaccine doses in the fall, after having to wait earlier in the year as the U.S., U.K. and other Western countries got the first waves of supply. South Korea has administered vaccines from AstraZeneca PLC, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna Inc., and Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.</p><p>Some 81.5% of South Korea's 52 million residents are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data, trailing only Portugal, Chile and Iceland among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By contrast, the vaccination rates stand at 61% in the U.S. and 69% in the U.K., according to Our World in Data.</p><p>South Korea's struggles show how difficult containing outbreaks remains, even in a place with a proven record of corralling viruses and where a swath of the population has gotten fully vaccinated. Public-health officials still see vaccines as an effective tool to combat outbreaks, and just a tiny fraction of the recent cases affect those who have received two Covid-19 shots.</p><p>Governments, even those with high vaccination rates, will be forced to revert to clampdowns if healthcare systems get overrun, especially with the threat of Omicron because it is unclear whether two doses are as effective against the variant, said Teo Yik-Ying, dean of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.</p><p>\"The assumptions that followed high vaccination rates may no longer be true,\" Prof. Teo said.</p><p>South Korea has reported 148 Omicron variant cases, though Delta remains the dominant force in what has been the country's worst outbreak of the pandemic. Daily cases regularly exceed 7,000, tripling in the past month. South Korea has never seen so many critically ill patients, with 90% of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients occupied in the Seoul metropolitan area. Deaths are at record levels, doubling from last month.</p><p>So limited now are hospital beds for Covid-19 patients that a pregnant woman, who had tested positive but was quarantining at home in a Seoul suburb, had to wait 10 hours to be admitted after she suddenly went into labor, a local emergency official said.</p><p>Some OECD countries with similar vaccination rates to South Korea's have also been forced to reinstitute restrictions amid fresh outbreaks. Portugal, where 89% of the population has gotten two Covid-19 shots, is requiring remote work from next month, while a negative test result is needed to enter nightclubs, bars and nursing homes, even for vaccinated people. Ireland, where 76% of the population is fully vaccinated, recently introduced a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs.</p><p>The U.K. recently imposed a work-from-home order and a requirement for proof of vaccination to attend nightclubs and some other indoor venues, as the government warned Omicron was rapidly spreading there.</p><p>\"Vaccination alone is not enough to prevent the spread of infections,\" said Ben Cowling, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics division at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health.</p><p>It was just six weeks ago that South Korean officials felt confident enough to start the era of \"living with Covid,\" as they put it. Businesses could stay open as long as they liked. Limits on private gatherings were lifted. Officials even held out the possibility of ending mask mandates if enough of the population got vaccinated.</p><p>Now, South Korea is warning daily infections could soon surpass 10,000 and possibly triple by next month, a senior health official said Thursday. The number of critically ill patients could roughly double from today, hitting about 2,000 in a worst-case scenario, the official added.</p><p>South Korea's moves to lower hospitalizations and slow infections have attracted criticism on a variety of fronts. Earlier this month, civic groups filed a petition to South Korea's human-rights watchdog, arguing that it was unconstitutional to penalize unvaccinated teens.</p><p>In February, teens who don't get fully vaccinated will be blocked from libraries, after-school academies and many other public facilities that require a digital \"vaccine pass\" to enter. At a recent protest, Lee Yeon-jin said she was worried that her 12-year-old daughter was too young to get a Covid-19 vaccination.</p><p>\"The government is threatening our children's right to learn by imposing these measures,\" said Ms. Lee, who is fully vaccinated herself.</p><p>South Korean health officials cited scientific research that vaccinations prevent serious illness and deaths by up to 90%, while lowering infection risks.</p><p>Just 0.2% of fully vaccinated people have experienced breakthrough infections in South Korea. Meanwhile, 99% of teenagers who were infected had not been vaccinated, health officials have said.</p><p>On Thursday, South Korean Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum, explaining the return of restrictions, said the country was facing a \"virus crisis.\"</p><p>\"We determined that we will be able to overcome this critical moment only if we quickly bring the spread under control through strong social-distancing measures,\" Mr. Kim said.</p><p>Write to Dasl Yoon at dasl.yoon@wsj.com</p><p>Highly Vaccinated South Korea Can't Slow Down Covid-19</p>",
