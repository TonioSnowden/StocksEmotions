  "title": "U.S. News:  CDC Advisers  Delay Decision  On J&J Shot  ----  By Betsy McKay and Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   The government's recommendation to pause using Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine will remain in place after an advisory panel put off a vote on how to move forward following reports of a few cases of life-threatening blood clots. </p><p>   The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, said Wednesday that it doesn't have enough information yet about the risk of these unusual side effects to determine whether the vaccine should be continued, discontinued or recommended only for certain groups of the population. </p><p>   The ACIP expects to meet again in another week or two to revisit the issue. </p><p>   U.S. health officials had recommended on Tuesday that use of the J&amp;J vaccine be paused while they investigate. </p><p>   The ACIP, which advises the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccination policy, met to review clinical data gathered to date on six women between the ages of 18 and 48 years who developed clots in vessels draining blood from their brains and in some cases other parts of the body after receiving J&amp;J's vaccine. </p><p>   One 45-year-old woman died. Three other women remain in the hospital, two of whom are in intensive care, the CDC said. The remaining two have been discharged from the hospital. </p><p>   More than 7.2 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.; about 1.5 million of those doses went to women between the ages of 18 and 50 years. </p><p>   A CDC official said the government warning about the cases might cause more people to report blood-clot side effects. Nearly 3.8 million doses of J&amp;J vaccine were administered between March 30 and this week's pause, meaning there might still be time for clots to develop in some of those recipients. </p><p>   The ACIP's findings and decisions will help determine how the federal government moves forward with the J&amp;J vaccine at a difficult juncture in the pandemic. The U.S. is racing to vaccinate more people to damp the impact of more infectious and rapidly spreading variants of the Covid-19 virus. </p><p>   Jeffrey Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said Wednesday that supplies of other vaccines are sufficient to make up for scheduled J&amp;J doses and to meet President Biden's goal of reaching 200 million doses in his first 100 days in office. He said 28 million doses of Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. vaccine were shipped this week. </p><p>   The six cases exceed the background rate for the rare brain blood-clotting condition alone in women of this age group, said Tom Shimabukuro, a vaccine safety expert at the CDC who presented data on the cases. The illness the six women developed -- cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, combined with a low-platelet count -- is even more rare, he said. </p><p>   J&amp;J has said it is aware of the cases involving blood clots and low platelet counts and is working with health authorities. It is unclear whether the vaccine causes the side effects. </p><p>   Based on the current data, J&amp;J believes the overall risk-benefit profile for its vaccine is positive across the population for which it is authorized, Aran Maree, chief medical officer of J&amp;J's pharmaceuticals unit, said during the meeting. </p><p>   Dr. Maree said J&amp;J was still seeking more details about the six cases of the clot. The vaccine was authorized for U.S. use in late February. </p><p>   The CDC issued an alert to healthcare providers Tuesday warning them to screen for the blood-clotting condition among patients who recently received the J&amp;J vaccine and have severe headache or abdominal pain, shortness of breath, backache, leg swelling, new neurologic symptoms or new or easy bruising. The condition requires a unique treatment, and healthcare providers shouldn't give these patients the standard treatment, which involves using the anticoagulant heparin, the agency also warned. </p><p>   No obvious risk factors stood out among the six women who developed the clots, the CDC's Dr. Shimabukuro said. All of the patients are white. Whites have received about 64% of the J&amp;J vaccines administered, and men and women ages 18 to 49 years have received 47% of the shots. </p><p>   One of the women used estrogen or progesterone. None was pregnant or had recently given birth. </p><p></p>",
