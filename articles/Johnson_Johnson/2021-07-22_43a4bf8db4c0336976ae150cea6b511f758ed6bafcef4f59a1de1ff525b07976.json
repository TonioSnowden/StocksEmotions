  "title": "States  Reach  Deal on  Painkiller  Lawsuits  ---  Four companies agree  to pay $26 billion over  a number of years for  opioid-related services  ----  By Sara Randazzo",
  "text": "<p>   States unveiled a $26 billion settlement with drug companies to resolve thousands of opioid-crisis lawsuits, paving the way for communities across the country to secure a jolt of funding to address an epidemic in painkiller addiction that hasn't abated. </p><p>   The nation's three largest drug distributors -- McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp., and Cardinal Health Inc. -- and drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson have been negotiating the deal for more than two years, but Wednesday's announcement signifies an important milestone that could clear the way for money to be received by states as soon as early next year. </p><p>   An opioid crisis that has claimed half a million lives in the U.S. has triggered more than 3,000 lawsuits filed by states, local governments, Native American tribes, hospital groups and others against players in the pharmaceutical industry. The lawsuits allege drugmakers pushed their painkillers for uses far beyond what was medically necessary and that distributors and pharmacies didn't do enough to halt masses of pills from flowing into communities. </p><p>   The companies said they made and distributed a medically necessary and federally regulated product. But the burdens of litigation -- like turning over internal documents, making employees available for depositions and preparing for complex trials that could air embarrassing details -- has sent many to the negotiating table. </p><p>   States can't use the money to fill general budget holes, like they did after a $206 billion deal with tobacco companies in the 1990s. Instead, the majority must be spent on social services like treatment programs, education on how to dispose of pills and needles, and bolstered funds for first responders. One community might use it to help a large problem of addiction in the homeless population, while another might be more focused on opioid-addicted babies. </p><p>   \"It won't be used to fill potholes, or build libraries, or balance budgets,\" said Paul Geller, a plaintiffs' lawyer representing several cities and counties involved in the deal. </p><p>   Individuals and families affected by opioid abuse won't receive any money directly. </p><p>   The attorneys general from Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Louisiana, Delaware and Connecticut made public the completed deal Wednesday, which had been rumored earlier this week. </p><p>    \"There's not enough money in the world frankly to address the pain and the suffering and the tragedy of the families all of us know in our states,\" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, said. </p><p>   Drug addiction got worse during the pandemic, with opioid overdose deaths up about 37% in 2020 from the prior year, according to government data. </p><p>   The broad terms call for the three distributors to pay as much as $21 billion collectively over a period of 18 years, and for Johnson &amp; Johnson to contribute $5 billion over nine years. The amounts could decrease if not enough states sign on, and the companies can walk away if they decide the level of participation doesn't buy them the peace they are seeking to put the lawsuits behind them. </p><p>   McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal said in a joint statement that they dispute the allegations against them but believe the deal is an important step toward resolving the claims and \"delivering meaningful relief to communities across the United States.\" </p><p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson's general counsel, Michael Ullmann, said, \"We recognize the opioid crisis is a tremendously complex public health issue,\" adding that the funds will help address the problem. </p><p>   Shares for the four companies rose this week after news reports, including from The Wall Street Journal, that the settlement was expected to come this week. Analysts said the development was positive, although investors likely baked the settlement amount into stock prices since the amounts have been known, and noted that the wholesalers have reserved cash to make the payments. </p><p>   Completing the deal took thousands of hours of negotiations among private plaintiffs' lawyers representing communities, state attorneys general and lawyers for the companies. </p><p>   The final details came together as opioid lawsuits went to trial in three states, putting pressure on both sides. Jurors in New York saw joking emails that employees at one distributor sent about addicts, including one that circulated a song about \"Pillbillies\" set to the theme of \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\" </p><p>   The settlements would resolve opioid lawsuits for these four companies, but several other targets remain. </p><p>   Trials are under way in California and New York against drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Ltd., AbbVie Inc.'s Allergan, and Endo International PLC. National pharmacy chains have also been named in hundreds of suits and are scheduled to go to trial in October. Two other companies that were targets of the suits, including OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, filed for bankruptcy and are negotiating settlements with states. </p><p>   Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington said he is rejecting the settlement because the $30 million a year that could flow to the state isn't the \"transformative amount of money\" needed to deal with the crisis. The state has coming trial dates against the four companies, and Mr. Ferguson, a Democrat, said he plans to go forward. </p><p>   Beyond the money involved, the distributors agreed to create a clearinghouse intended to help the companies better spot suspicious drug orders. </p><p>   \"This settlement. . .puts in place controls that will go a long way to making sure this never happens again,\" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jared S.
