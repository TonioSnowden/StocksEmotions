  "text": "<p>There's always an undercurrent of righteous indignation in an Alex Gibney-directed film, whether the subject is Scientology, torture, reform-minded Russian oligarchs or Lance Armstrong. But the same can be said of much nonfiction cinema. What separates Mr. Gibney's work from the pack of likeminded documentary makers is the documentation. The investigation. That, and the wisdom to know that crime, corruption, malfeasance and self-dealing aren't necessarily enough to make a film engaging, or entertaining. It's still a motion picture. It needs to have motion.</p><p>In Mr. Gibney's two-part \"Crime of the Century,\" which is on HBO in two-hour installments Monday and Tuesday nights, the cinema is as exhilarating as the journalism is exhaustive. Still, the style remains in service to the story: how big pharma lied and bribed its way into billions of dollars while leaving death and devastation behind, through a seemingly conscience-free crusade to sell stronger and stronger opiates to more and more people.</p><p>It's a success story, from the industry's point of view. It's also a story of villainy, with a catalog of villains -- not just the Sacklers family of Purdue Pharma, but their sales representatives; the U.S. congressmen to whom they made outsize donations (Christopher Dodd, the former senator from Purdue Pharma's home state of Connecticut, is spotlighted); the former prosecutors hired as lobbyists (Mary Jo White and, somehow inevitably, Rudolph Giuliani); and officials of the Justice Department and the Food and Drug Administration -- where Curtis Wright, a physician and deputy director, collaborated with Purdue Pharma executives in drafting the review of OxyContin that helped open the way to its 1996 entry into the marketplace.</p><p>The rest, as might be said, is drug-epidemic history, although \"Crime of the Century,\" produced in association with the Washington Post, begins with a sprint through a much lengthier history, of both the opium poppy and the drug trade -- from the ancient Egyptians and Alexander the Great to the East India Company, the Opium Wars, Bayer's marketing of Heroin (originally a tradename), the Astors, the Italian Mafia, and various pharmaceutical companies that use narcotics in their products. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mr. Gibney tells us, led the way in mechanizing both the harvesting of opium poppies and the processing of their contents; provided incentives to Tasmanian farmers to switch from potatoes to poppies; and added bonuses to those raising the most potent crops.</p><p>The point of the history lesson is that the profit to be made from opiates and their synthetic derivatives has always been irresistible and that now-disgraced Purdue Pharma's addiction to drug money is part of a long and ignoble series of enterprises. \"The business of criminal cartels and pharmaceutical companies are connected,\" Mr. Gibney says in voiceover -- the very obvious example being the drift to heroin by addicts thwarted by the increased expense and reduced availability of opioids. The director then goes about establishing how and why that is so.</p><p>The default argument of Purdue Pharma and its defenders is that drug users, not drug makers, are responsible for addiction. But as the miniseries points out, the information that was fed to doctors and on which patients based the use of prescriptions -- including the claim that delayed-action OxyContin wasn't addictive -- was simply untrue. Purdue denies misleading anyone.</p><p>The opioid story in general isn't new, but a lot of what Mr. Gibney offers is: previously unseen footage from Purdue Pharma heir Richard Sackler's 2015 deposition in a case brought by Kentucky; interviews with former pharma sales reps who discuss the company's practices of bribing doctors and encouraging them to prescribe high doses of opioids, which the company has denied; and interviews with former DEA insiders and officials who led major investigations into the complex pharmaceutical networks involved.</p><p>For all the depressing behavior and people, there are heroes, too. West Virginian Mark Ross, a former sales rep with Purdue Pharma, details the unethical marketing practices of the company and its disregard of his warnings about the opioid explosion in Appalachia. (\"I was kind of like the canary in the coal mine,\" he says. \"But nobody was running. Nobody was leaving.\") Art Van Zee, a small-town physician from western Virginia, testified about the opioid addiction rampant among his patients before a Senate committee, where he was belittled by then-Sen. Dodd. Author-journalists Patrick Radden Keefe (\"Empire of Pain\") and Barry Meier (\"Pain Killer\") are among the more enlightening interviewees.</p><p>One of the more morbidly fascinating anecdotes recounted in part 1 of the series involves Gary Blinn, an ex-heroin addict with a higher-than-normal resistance to opiates who was enlisted by a Purdue Pharma operative to be a kind of lab rat. The company wanted to explore how much OxyContin a body could tolerate. At one point, Mr. Blinn recounts, he was taking 25 high-potency pills a day, \"like sitting down to a bowl of Cheerios\" -- or, as someone else puts it, enough OxyContin \"to kill a horse.\"</p><p>Mr. Blinn's Purdue connection was among those who testified before a federal grand-jury investigation in Virginia into Purdue Pharma's practices, one that produced a 120-page prosecution document that was never acted upon and was, of course, confidential. (As Mr. Gibney says, \"We got a copy.\") What it led to was \"the illusion of justice,\" as an ex-prosecutor puts it, a relatively paltry $600 million fine and a felony plea by Purdue Pharma, which indemnified its executives. Some got bonuses for the \"pain\" they suffered in having to testify. The ironies aren't belabored in \"Crime of the Century.\" But they're certainly present.</p>",
