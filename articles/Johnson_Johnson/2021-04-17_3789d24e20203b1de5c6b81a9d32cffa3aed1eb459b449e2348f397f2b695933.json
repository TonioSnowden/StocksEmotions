  "text": "<p>    Johnson &amp; Johnson said there wasn't enough evidence to establish that the company's Covid-19 vaccine causes the rare blood-clotting condition that prompted U.S. health officials this week to recommend a pause in its use. </p><p>   The New England Journal of Medicine published online a letter from three J&amp;J employees involved in vaccine development and epidemiology saying, \"At this time, evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events\" and J&amp;J's vaccine. </p><p>   U.S. health authorities this week recommended a pause in vaccinations using J&amp;J's single-dose vaccine while they investigated six cases of a rare blood clot, combined with low blood-platelet counts, in women who had received the J&amp;J vaccine. One of the women died. </p><p>   The pause is expected to remain in place at least until a federal vaccine-advisory committee meets April 23 to review the matter. </p><p>   Authorities in several countries have restricted use of J&amp;J's vaccine, and a shot from AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford that uses a similar technology, after receiving reports of people getting blood clots following vaccinations. </p><p></p>",
