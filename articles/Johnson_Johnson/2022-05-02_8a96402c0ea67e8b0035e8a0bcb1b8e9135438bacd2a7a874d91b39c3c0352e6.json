  "title": "Judge Urges Expansion of Mass-Tort Bankruptcy Tools; A Texas bankruptcy judge says asbestos bankruptcy tools should be expanded",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J placed into bankruptcy last year a subsidiary called LTL Management LLC created to house the legacy liabilities stemming from the company's baby powder sales and move them into chapter 11.</p><p>The company's legal maneuver poses certain challenges that might be best resolved through legislation, specifically by expanding a part of the bankruptcy code addressing companies with mass asbestos liabilities, Judge Jones said, speaking Friday to restructuring professionals at an American Bankruptcy Institute conference in Washington.</p><p>\"I hope Congress will realize that maybe we need to expand 524(g),\" Judge Jones said, referring to the chapter 11 provision added by Congress in 1994 to ease asbestos-driven bankruptcy cases and set up compensation trusts for victims.</p><p>In addition to J&amp;J, several other companies have used Texas corporate restructurings to move asbestos-related liabilities into chapter 11 to access the protections of 524(g) without putting large business assets in bankruptcy. Collectively, these chapter 11 cases have put roughly a quarter million personal-injury lawsuits on hold.</p><p>Panelists noted Friday that among the challenges of the Texas strategy is that state law allowing for so-called divisive mergers may be in conflict with federal laws barring the transfer of assets out of a company shortly before its bankruptcy filing.</p><p>A few companies have used the same strategy, known colloquially as the Texas Two-Step, in recent years to hive off asbestos liabilities, but J&amp;J was the first to deploy it to resolve other types of claims. In addition to claims from asbestos cancer victims, J&amp;J faces a far larger number of claims linking talc to ovarian cancer. The company has denied liability and said its talc is safe while seeking a settlement with the plaintiffs.</p><p>The number of lawsuits alleging Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer went from zero five years ago to 40,000 today, said Gregory Gordon of Jones Day, a lawyer for J&amp;J's bankrupt LTL subsidiary. The company spent $4.5 billion to settle with plaintiffs, including $1 billion spent on defense costs, before the LTL bankruptcy, Mr. Gordon said.</p><p>Some of the largest bankruptcy cases in recent years have involved mass tortsâ€”large numbers of lawsuits and claims for alleged harm against companies and organizations like opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma LP, the Boy Scouts of America and USA Gymnastics.</p><p>There are still questions about the Texas Two-Step strategy that are being debated in the bankruptcy world, said Natasha Tsiouris of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP. Foremost among those questions, Ms. Tsiouris said, are: \"Is it a fraudulent transfer and is it just a bad-faith abuse of the bankruptcy system?\"</p><p>J&amp;J won a court ruling earlier this year when Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., ruled that the company didn't file the LTL case in bad faith and denied plaintiffs' request to have the chapter 11 proceedings dismissed. The plaintiffs won his permission to appeal his ruling immediately to a higher court.</p><p>Write to Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com</p>",
