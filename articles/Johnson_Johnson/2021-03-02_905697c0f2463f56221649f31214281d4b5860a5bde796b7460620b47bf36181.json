Phil Murphy said. </p><p>\n  Childcare employees, migrant farmworkers and members of Native American tribes also will be eligible for vaccinations on March 15, the governor said Monday at a news conference. Food-production workers, clergy members and postal workers will become eligible on March 29. </p><p>\n  This expansion covers hundreds of thousands of New Jersey residents, Mr. Murphy said. Currently, people over the age of 65, people with certain health conditions, healthcare workers, first responders and residents and workers at long-term-care facilities are eligible for inoculations. </p><p>\n  New Jersey had administered more than 2 million doses of vaccines as of Monday. </p><p>\n  The state is slated to receive 70,000 doses of the newly approved Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine by mid- to late week, Mr. Murphy said. The one-shot vaccine would give the state new flexibility to administer vaccinations because it doesn't require being kept in special cold-storage freezers, he said. </p><p>\n  Even with the arrival of the new vaccine, the governor urged residents to be patient for their turn. </p><p>\n  -- Joseph De Avila </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  OBITUARY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  St. Bonaventure </p><p>\n  President Dies at 62 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  St. Bonaventure University President Dennis DePerro died Monday from complications of Covid-19, according to the university. He was 62 years old. </p><p>\n  Dr. DePerro had been hospitalized since late December after testing positive for Covid-19 on Christmas Eve.
