  "title": "Halt Lifted  On Use of  J&J Vaccine  ----  By Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   Vaccinations with Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 shot should resume, U.S. health regulators said after investigating rare blood-clotting cases, restoring a key tool for filling gaps in the mass vaccination campaign. </p><p>   To alert doctors and recipients to the condition that led to a pause in the vaccine's use last week, J&amp;J and regulators plan to add language to the shot's label and fact sheets warning of the clotting condition risk. </p><p>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday lifted their recommendation to pause use of the shots, saying the benefits outweigh the risks. Their decision followed a vote by a federal vaccine advisory committee recommending restarting use of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S. </p><p>   J&amp;J's vaccine could be back in circulation as soon as this weekend because millions of doses have already been distributed, ending a pause that began last week. </p><p>   Its availability could fulfill demand among people who prefer to get a single shot, rather than two doses spaced weeks apart required for protection from the Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. vaccines. </p><p>   Yet the back-and-forth over the J&amp;J vaccine's use could also prompt some people concerned about safety to seek the other shots or even avoid getting vaccinated. After the FDA and CDC recommended to pause use of J&amp;J's vaccine, health experts expressed concern the move could exacerbate vaccine hesitancy. </p><p>   A CDC official said if vaccinations with J&amp;J's shot resumed, it could prevent up to 1,400 deaths from Covid-19 and up to 3,500 admissions to intensive-care units over a six-month period, though there could be up to 45 cases of the rare blood-clot condition. </p><p>   \"The benefits clearly outweigh the risks, though there are differences in age groups, and particularly for women less than 50 years of age,\" said Dr. Katherine Poehling, a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that made the recommendation, who is also a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Wake Forest School of Medicine. </p><p>   J&amp;J vaccine injections were put on hold after reports of a rare blood-clot condition in a small number of recipients, with at least three fatalities. </p><p>   Nearly eight million doses of J&amp;J's vaccine had been administered at the time of the pause, according to the CDC. </p><p>   The risk of blood clots is much higher from Covid-19 disease than from the vaccines associated with these complications, said Jean Connors, a hematologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, in an interview. </p><p>   Blood clotting all over the body is one complication of severe forms of the disease. About 15% to 20% of Covid-19 patients who are admitted to intensive-care units develop blood clots, Dr. Connors said. </p><p>   Following a six-hour meeting on Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the CDC on vaccines and includes doctors and public-health officials, voted 10 to 4, with one abstention, in favor of lifting the recommended pause on the J&amp;J vaccine and restarting use among all adults. It was the ACIP's second emergency meeting in 10 days to discuss the J&amp;J vaccine. </p><p>   After the ACIP's vote, J&amp;J said it would collaborate with health authorities to ensure the clot condition can be identified early and treated. J&amp;J has agreed with the FDA to add language to the vaccine's label warning about the clot risk, J&amp;J Chief Medical Officer Joanne Waldstreicher told members of the vaccine committee during its meeting. </p><p>   The committee met after authorities had identified a total of 15 cases of women experiencing blood clots combined with low blood-platelet counts after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, according to a presentation by a CDC official during Friday's ACIP meeting. Three of the women died. </p><p>   Two of the cases were in women 50 and older, while the rest were between 18 and 49 years of age. The symptoms, including severe headaches and nausea, started around one to two weeks after vaccination. The CDC is calling the rare condition \"thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome,\" or TTS. </p><p>   Most of the women had blood clots in veins that drain blood from the brain, but some had clots only in other parts of the body, according to the CDC's presentation to the ACIP panel. The condition is also marked by low levels in the blood of platelets, which play a role in clotting. </p><p>   Four of the first six patients who developed clotting and low platelets were treated with heparin, which can worsen their condition. Health authorities now say non-heparin blood thinners should be used to treat these patients. </p><p>   The CDC is investigating fewer than 10 potential additional cases of TTS, Tom Shimabukuro, a CDC vaccine-safety official, said during the ACIP meeting. He also cited one case of a woman who experienced TTS and died, but she was excluded from the case count partly because she also had contracted Covid-19 after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine. </p><p>   Dr. Shimabukuro said the rare condition is similar to cases that have been reported in Europe among recipients of AstraZeneca PLC's Covid-19 vaccine. He said this rare condition wasn't seen in people who received the messenger RNA-based vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. </p><p>   Though the incidence of the clot risk appears low, some ACIP members expressed concern about its seriousness. \"It's not an insignificant risk,\" said committee member Pablo Sanchez, who is also a pediatric infectious diseases specialist Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \"It makes me nervous.\" </p><p>   Some committee members wanted their recommendation to also state that women under 50 should be aware of the clot risk and may choose a different Covid-19 vaccine. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Betsy McKay, Eric Sylvers and Tarini Parti contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
