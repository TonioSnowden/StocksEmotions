  "title": "World News:  Vaccine Rollout Falters in Bulgaria  ----  By Georgi Kantchev",
  "text": "<p>   BURGAS, Bulgaria -- As a European Union member state, Bulgaria has access to Western-approved Covid-19 shots and enough doses for its population. But a mix of misinformation, low trust in authorities and conflicting messaging means less than a fifth of Bulgarians are fully vaccinated. </p><p>   With few takers at home and some shots soon expiring, the government recently donated 172,500 doses to the Kingdom of Bhutan. Some expired shots are being thrown away. </p><p>   Bulgaria, a country of some seven million people, has fully vaccinated far less of its population than the EU average of 61% and the U.S. rate of 54%, according to Our World in Data, a project based at Oxford University. It has emerged as an extreme case study of the challenge to convince vaccine holdouts to get the shot. It also illustrates the risks if those efforts fail as the infectious Delta variant spreads. Bulgaria currently has the EU's highest death and hospitalization rates relative to the population, according to Our World in Data. </p><p>   \"Here we have a perfect storm of mistrust, antivaxers and fake news,\" said Prof. Nikolay Vitanov, a mathematician at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences who has advised authorities on their Covid-19 strategy. \"Mortality is very high yet people just don't trust anything.\" </p><p>   Bulgaria is recording roughly more than 1,500 new daily cases and over 50 deaths a day. Nearly 20,000 Bulgarians have died from Covid-19, a number experts say is an undercount as not all deaths are being recorded. </p><p>   Still, only 39% of Bulgarians think that everyone should get vaccinated, the lowest level in the bloc, according to an August survey by Eurobarometer, the EU's opinion-polling unit. </p><p>   Incentives have fallen flat. A large hypermarket chain has recently started giving vouchers worth 20 leva, equivalent to $12, to those who get a shot in its vaccination centers. But on a recent afternoon, one center was empty, with only a couple of British tourists asking whether foreigners can get a shot. They can't. </p><p>   Other Eastern European nations also have low vaccination rates, with Romania having fully inoculated less than a third of its population. Vaccine skepticism, historically has run high in the region, fueled by an active antivaccine movement, poverty and mistrust. Half of respondents in Eastern European nations considered vaccines safe in a 2018 Gallup poll, compared with 59% in Western Europe and 72% in North America. </p><p>   In Bulgaria, the deep-seated mistrust in authorities is fueling skepticism, observers say. Only 33% of Bulgarians trust their public administration, compared with an EU average of 52%, according to a July Eurobarometer survey. </p><p>   This has historical roots. Many Bulgarians say they grew accustomed to being deceived and misled by authorities during the country's decadeslong communist rule last century. Some point to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in April 1986, when the Bulgarian government withheld the news for days and allowed May 1 parades to take place even as radioactive clouds already had reached the country. </p><p>   Bulgaria's vaccine campaign has been hampered by a political crisis that has the country on course to hold a parliamentary vote in November, its third election this year. </p><p>   The Bulgarian health ministry acknowledged the slow inoculation rate, blaming it on missteps related to the rollout by the previous government. That administration, in turn, accuses the current one of mismanaging the process. </p><p>   The low vaccination level could hit the fragile, tourism-dependent economy of Bulgaria, EU's poorest member state, officials say. Bulgaria is generally open to tourists from most countries, provided they have a vaccine certificate or a negative test. </p><p>   \"If we continue to behave like the idiots of Europe, it will hit our economy and tourism,\" Angel Kunchev, Bulgaria's chief state health inspector, told state television Wednesday. \"People will just choose safe places.\" </p><p>   Bulgaria's available vaccines include those by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca PLC. The health ministry said it had set up vaccination centers in shopping malls, beaches and parks and started an information campaign. </p><p>   Galya Staleva doesn't want the shot. The 40-year-old listed a litany of reasons, including that she doesn't believe in the vaccine's safety and efficacy. \"I don't trust anything I'm being told,\" she said. </p><p>   False claims have been spreading on social media and some news websites. At the same time, mainstream media have devoted significant airtime to vaccine skeptics. </p><p>   \"Fake news is everywhere and the media has given a lot of time to opinions without any scientific backing,\" said Dr. Alexander Simidchiev, a member of Parliament and pulmonologist who treated Covid patients. </p><p></p>",
