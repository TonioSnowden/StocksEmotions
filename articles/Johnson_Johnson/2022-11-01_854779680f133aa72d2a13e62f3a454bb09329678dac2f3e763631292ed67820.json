  "title": "J&J Agrees to Buy Heart-Device Maker Abiomed for $16.6 Billion; Deal would add heart pumps, a fast-growing part of the medical-device industry, to J&J's lineup",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J, the world's largest maker of healthcare products by sales, is pursuing its biggest deal in several years as it adapts to a changing healthcare market.</p><p>The company plans next year to separate its consumer-products unit, which sells Tylenol and Band-Aids, into a stand-alone company. The move will leave J&amp;J more concentrated in its remaining two units, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p><p>Chief Executive Joaquin Duato has emphasized strengthening the medical-device unit through deals. It has, like the rest of the industry, struggled to find new, substantial sources of growth. Once J&amp;J's largest business by sales, medical devices have been eclipsed by the company's pharmaceuticals division.</p><p>\"This acquisition is consistent with that strategy, expanding J&amp;J med tech into high-growth markets, and accelerating revenue growth while advancing the standard of care,\" Mr. Duato said.</p><p>Abiomed, and its fast-growing Impella heart pump, could provide a boost. The heart pump is used to treat conditions including a heart attack, heart failure and clogged arteries. J&amp;J expects to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>The bet could face challenges, however, if Impella sales don't increase as much as J&amp;J expects. Abiomed has been testing new uses for Impella that could furnish new revenue, but it isn't guaranteed the studies will be positive or that regulators would clear new uses on the timetables that J&amp;J envisions, Stifel analyst Rick Wise said.</p><p>J&amp;J, of New Brunswick, N.J., has been trying for years to increase sales growth of its medical-device unit. The pressure for a turnaround has grownas the company prepares to hive off its business selling Tylenol, Listerine and other consumer-health products.</p><p>The unit, which sells artificial knees, contact lenses and surgical products, had sales of $27.06 billion in 2021, up 18% from 2020. Sales had rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic. In previous years, however, the unit had moderate growth and sometimes sales declines.</p><p>Abiomed, of Danvers, Mass., is in one of the fastest-growing areas of the medical-device industry. The company's sales rose 22% last fiscal year ending March 31 to $1.03 billion. It would bring about $937 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to J&amp;J.</p><p>Founded in 1981, Abiomed acquired the Impella pump with its purchase of Germany's Impella CardioSystems in 2005. The pump was introduced first in Europe, and then received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in 2008.</p><p>Abiomed bills Impella as the world's smallest heart pump. For many patients, it is placed in the heart via a catheter inserted into a leg artery, to temporarily assist the heart's pumping function while patients undergo other procedures to treat underlying cardiovascular disease.</p><p>It can also be implanted during surgery.</p><p>J&amp;J executives said they expect to further accelerate Impella sales by introducing it in more countries and expanding the approved uses for the pump.</p><p>The deal \"will enable us to leverage Johnson &amp; Johnson's global scale, commercial strength and clinical expertise to accelerate our mission of making heart recovery the global standard of care,\" Abiomed Chief Executive Michael Minogue said.</p><p>Mr. Minogue, who has led Abiomed since 2004, will retire upon the deal's closing. Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Greenfield will serve as president, J&amp;J said.</p><p>The Abiomed deal is J&amp;J's biggest since its $30 billion purchase of drugmaker Actelion in 2017. It is the company's biggest device deal since its $19.7 billion purchase of Synthes Inc. in 2012.</p><p>Unlike with some past purchases, J&amp;J doesn't plan to tightly integrate Abiomed into the rest of its business. Abiomed will operate as a stand-alone business within J&amp;J's device unit, Ashley McEvoy, executive vice president and worldwide chairman of J&amp;J's device unit, said on the conference call.</p><p>\"They're taking the proven excellent team from Abiomed, and they're giving them incentives to succeed as they hit various clinical milestones,\" said Mr. Wise, the Stifel analyst.</p><p>J&amp;J expects the acquisition will be neutral to or slightly reduce earnings in the first year, but then add 5 cents a share in 2024 and to add increasingly to earnings thereafter.</p><p>J&amp;J said it is using a combination of cash on hand and short-term financing for the Abiomed deal. J&amp;J held $11.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, plus $22.7 billion in marketable securities as of Oct. 2, according to a securities filing.</p><p>In addition to the upfront $380 per share, Abiomed shareholders will receive contingent value rights that could entitle them to receive up to $35 per share at later dates.</p><p>This includes $17.50 per share if sales of certain Abiomed products exceed $3.7 billion during the 12 months ending in the first quarter of 2028. Shareholders may also get $7.50 per share if the FDA clears additional uses for Impella, and $10 per share if Impella is recommended for certain uses in cardiology clinical guidelines.</p><p>Abiomed's marketing of Impella attracted government scrutiny more than a decade ago. The FDA sent the company a warning letter in 2011 stating that some of Abiomed's promotional materials marketed Impella for uses that had not been approved by the FDA.</p><p>In 2013, the FDA closed out its review after Abiomed took corrective actions that appeared to address the concerns.</p><p>Some cardiologists have also debated the safety and effectiveness of Impella pumps for certain uses. An analysis by researchers at several medical schools, presented at the American Heart Association conference in 2019, found that hospitals using Impella for certain conditions had higher rates of adverse events and higher costs when compared with an older procedure.</p><p>Abiomed said in 2019 that the analysis was flawed and that studies have shown Impella to have a positive risk-benefit profile.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Agrees to Buy Heart-Device Maker Abiomed for $16.6 Billion</p>",
