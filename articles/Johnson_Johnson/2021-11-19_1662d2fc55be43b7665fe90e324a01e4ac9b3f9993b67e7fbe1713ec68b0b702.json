  "title": "Covid-19 Boosters From Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Cleared for All U.S. Adults; The FDA authorized the third dose for anyone 18 years and older, after earlier clearing the shot for people at high risk",
  "text": "<p>Under the federal authorizations, people 18 years and older could begin receiving the additional doses within days, should the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention give a positive recommendation shortly.</p><p>Supplies should be readily available, according to federal and state health officials. The U.S. has bought a total of 600 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses, and 500 million Moderna doses..</p><p>The authorization is the latest in a rapid—and for many people, confusing—series of moves by federal health authorities in recent months aiming to shore up people's immune defenses to help the U.S. stay ahead of the pandemic.</p><p>The Biden administration had aimed to make boosters broadly available in September. Yet its own health agencies have moved more deliberately, clearing boosters for people with weakened immune systems and then high-risk adults as evidence in support of the moves emerged.</p><p>One factor driving the push is that making boosters available to all adults will clear up confusion about who should get the doses.</p><p>\"Streamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA center that oversees vaccines.</p><p>All adults who received a single dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine have already been eligible to get any of the three authorized shots as a booster.</p><p>The latest authorizations apply to adults at least six months past their second shot, whether they got the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine initially.</p><p>One more move remains before all adults can access Pfizer-BioNTech booster doses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue its own recommendation. The agency is expected to do so also on Friday, after its advisers review the matter earlier in the day.</p><p>Many doctors, pharmacies and other vaccination sites follow the direction of the CDC, which guides the practice of medicine and public health. The FDA regulates whether a vaccine works safely enough to be used outside testing.</p><p>The booster expansion comes after the Delta-driven increases over the summer have receded in most states, only for some places to recently experience an uptick in cases, raising the average number of daily cases nationally. That has led to concerns about a winter surge.</p><p>Behind the push for boosters is some research finding that the protection that vaccination provides against symptomatic infections wanes after six months or so.</p><p>Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., pointed to data from Israel and other recent studies indicating that boosters reduced the risk of hospitalization and death in people at least 40 years old and symptomatic infections among younger people.</p><p>\"This booster has a big bang for blocking infections, and that's the whole point, that's how you break the transmission chain,\" he said.</p><p>Yet other health experts say that increasing primary vaccinations, not boosters, is the best way to protect everyone and reduce the spread of the virus, since studies show community transmission is mostly driven by unvaccinated people.</p><p>Vaccines weren't designed to prevent infections, the critics say, but rather prevent severe disease and hospitalizations.</p><p>\"I think the goal should be to reduce severe disease, hospitalization and death. We have not even achieved that right now and that's what we need to focus on,\" said Celine Gounder, an infectious-disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York.</p><p>She said available data supports boosting people over 65 years and immunocompromised people, but not the broader population.</p><p>Despite the debate, many people have sought booster shots, including those who might not fit the criteria outlined by health authorities.</p><p>A handful of states and cities, including Arkansas, West Virginia and New York City, have also expanded booster eligibility beyond federal government guidelines in an effort to prevent winter surges.</p><p>Since the FDA began authorizing boosters, more than 30 million people have received the extra doses, including more than 18 million people who received Pfizer-BioNTech's, according to the CDC.</p><p>The FDA's latest decision simplifies the currently confusing recommendations, said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's vaccine research group. \"It makes for very easy, clear public health messaging: If you're 18 or over, get a booster,\" he said.</p><p>In September, the FDA cleared a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adults who are 65 years and older or are at high risk of severe disease and death, including because of their jobs or where they live.</p><p>The government has also endorsed additional shots from Moderna for high-risk people, and is backing mixing and matching extra doses of the three vaccines cleared for use.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>When do you expect to get your Covid-19 booster shot? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In August, Pfizer and BioNTech sought clearance of boosters for people 16 years and older, but the agency limited the extra doses to the elderly and adults who were at high risk after outside scientific advisers said they weren't convinced that broad boosters were necessary at the time.</p><p>Since then, though, Pfizer and BioNTech shared results from a study of about 10,000 subjects 16 years and older that found the booster shot was 95.6% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19.</p><p>Researchers also found the additional dose was safe and tolerable, and consistent with what was known about the vaccine, the companies said.</p><p>Last month, the FDA cleared a booster shot of Moderna at half the dose of each of the first two shots. Moderna sought authorization for seniors and high-risk adults after Pfizer-BioNTech's booster was approved for those people.</p><p>In Moderna's booster application, the company presented data, from a study of nearly 300 people, indicating a half-dose booster given at least six months after initial vaccination restored antibody levels.</p><p>Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jared S.
