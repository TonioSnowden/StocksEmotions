  "text": "<p>During nearly five decades in retailing, he helped establish the T.J. Maxx, Zayre and BJ's Wholesale Club retail chains. \"We tried to give our customers convenience and an outstanding value,\" Mr. Feldberg told the Boston Globe in 2004.</p><p>Working for his father and an uncle, Mr. Feldberg was involved in launching the Zayre discount department stores in the mid-1950s. Zayre stores attracted middle- and low-income shoppers and proliferated in the suburbs but began struggling in the 1970s.</p><p>Looking for a new formula, Mr. Feldberg spotted a small chain called Marshalls. He was eager to buy it, but Melville Corp. trumped him with a winning bid in late 1975. The Feldbergs responded by poaching a top Marshalls merchandiser, Ben Cammarata, who led what became the rival T.J. Maxx chain.</p><p>T.J. Maxx thrived by buying surplus merchandise from the suppliers of brands featured in high-end department stores, then selling it at steep markdowns. The merchandise mix was unpredictable and changed frequently. Many shoppers enjoyed the treasure hunt for bargains and couldn't resist frequently visiting the shops.</p><p>Both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are now owned by TJX Cos.</p><p>Mr. Feldberg, who retired as chairman of TJX in 1995 and moved to Palm Beach, Fla., died July 1. He was 98.</p><p>He challenged the idea that people in retailing needed instincts about style and fashion. \"In most cases,\" he said, \"it is common sense and hard workâ€”hard work to study what's selling.\"</p><p>Sumner Lee Feldberg was born June 19, 1924, and grew up partly in the Boston suburb of Newton. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. His father, Morris Feldberg, teamed up with a brother, Max, to buy women's hosiery from a mill and sell it to retailers. They later founded a New England chain of low-price women's clothing stores, Bell Shops.</p><p>After starting his studies at Harvard, Sumner Feldberg enlisted in the Army Air Forces during World War II and was trained as a meteorologist. Sent to Brazil, he helped provide weather forecasts to U.S. pilots. Later, he was transferred to a desk job in North Carolina.</p><p>After the war, he completed his undergraduate studies at Harvard and was selected for the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Joining a host of other future business leaders fresh from military service, he enrolled in Harvard Business School. Along with Mr. Traub, his class of 1949 included James E. Burke, who later headed Johnson &amp; Johnson; C. Peter McColough of Xerox Corp.; Thomas S. Murphy of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.; and William Ruane of the Sequoia Fund.</p><p>He joined his father at Bell Shops, where his first job was unpacking and inspecting merchandise. Mr. Feldberg soon recognized that the business was overly dependent on downtown locations that were losing shoppers to suburban malls. Some New England rivals were opening discount stores in abandoned textile mills, which came with cheap rents and plenty of parking space.</p><p>Mr. Feldberg, who had studied the history of retailing at Harvard, thought the mill stores were merely a fad. Instead, he bet on supermarket-style stores, with self-service, offering clothing, toys, beauty supplies and housewares. That idea became the basis for the family's chain of Zayre discount stores, introduced in 1956 with two locations in Massachusetts.</p><p>\"We grew at a ferocious pace, doubling in size every two years,\" he said in a video interview prepared for his family. To help fund that growth, the family's Zayre Corp. went public in 1962. One of his cousins, Stanley Feldberg, was president of Zayre. Sumner Feldberg headed financial operations and later was promoted to chairman.</p><p>Rapid inflation, recession and rising competition from other discounters weakened Zayre in the 1970s. T.J. Maxx provided a new spurt of growth. The Feldbergs also expanded a cut-price women's apparel chain, Hit or Miss, acquired in 1970.</p><p>Zayre later added BJ's Wholesale Club stores, competing with the likes of the Sam's Club and Costco chains.</p><p>Ames Department Stores Inc. acquired the core Zayre discount stores in 1988 for about $800 million. Less than two years later, Ames filed for bankruptcy-court protection, largely because of losses at the former Zayre stores.</p><p>Meanwhile, the T.J. Maxx and Hit or Miss brands became part of TJX. BJ's was spun off into Waban Inc.</p><p>Mr. Feldberg married Esther Lichter, who also grew up in Newton, in 1964. She survives him, along with two children, six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. An earlier marriage ended in divorce.</p><p>Esther and Sumner Feldberg donated an art collection, including works by Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein, to the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla. Their philanthropy also included gifts to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brandeis University.</p><p>Write to James R. Hagerty at bob.hagerty@wsj.com</p><p>T.J.
