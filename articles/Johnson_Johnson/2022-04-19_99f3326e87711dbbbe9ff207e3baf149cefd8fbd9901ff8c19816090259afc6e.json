  "text": "<p>The market is in the thick of earnings season with dozens of big U.S. companies expected to report this week. Given high inflation, investors are watching for signs of which firms are able to preserve their profits by passing higher costs along to customers through price increases.</p><p>Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson gained 3.8% after the pharmaceutical firm beat earnings expectations. Travelers fell 3.1% despite reporting higher earnings and lifting its dividend.</p><p>Concerns about inflation—which has soared to multidecade highs—and how central banks might respond have dominated investors' thinking for months, but so far corporate finances have been protected as firms have largely managed to pass higher costs on to consumers. Investors say they are expecting earnings growth to moderate this quarter as it becomes harder for companies to continue raising consumer costs.</p><p>\"The longer prices stay high, the longer the war in Ukraine continues, the higher likelihood that something has to give. Corporations cannot continue to pass on input costs forever,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds. \"There has to be a tipping point.\"</p><p>In other corporate news, shares of American Campus Communities jumped 13% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Blackstone is buying the student-housing owner in a deal valued at $12.8 billion.</p><p>Plug Power shares rose 6.1% after the alternative energy company said it had struck a deal with Walmart to supply the retailer with hydrogen.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note kept climbing. The yield on the benchmark bond rose to 2.923% from 2.861% on Monday, which was the highest settlement since December 2018.</p><p>Bond yields rise as prices fall, and investors have been selling bonds on expectations of high inflation and interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"Fixed income has been a particular point of pain. This is the worst bear market in bonds we've seen in a generation,\" Mr. O'Reilly said.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 3.4% to $109.31 a barrel. Gold prices declined 1%.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 1% as household goods companies and healthcare stocks slumped.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mixed. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.7% as Japan's yen fell to a 20-year low against the dollar. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 2.3%, dragged lower by technology firms.</p><p>-Karen Langley contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Climb as Earnings Season Ramps Up</p>",
