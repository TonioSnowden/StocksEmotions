  "title": "Pfizer's  Covid-19  Vaccine  Wins Full  Approval  ---  FDA's formal blessing  expected to open door  to more employers,  schools requiring shot  ----  By Jared S. Hopkins and Stephanie Armour",
  "text": "<p>   The U.S. gave full approval for use of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE on Monday, a move quickly followed by announcements from the Pentagon, the New York City school district and others that they would begin requiring vaccinations. </p><p>   The Food and Drug Administration's approval was seen by public-health officials as a key step to convince hesitant individuals to get the shot and to pave the way for more employers and schools to require it. </p><p>   The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was first cleared in December by the FDA on an emergency-use basis for people 16 years and older after the drugmakers showed it to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19. The two-dose shot --  resulting from the fastest vaccine development ever in the West -- has since become the most received Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S. </p><p>    Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccines subsequently also received emergency-use authorizations. </p><p>   Many people hesitant about the vaccine and opponents of mandatory-vaccination measures have cited the emergency-use authorization as grounds for not requiring vaccinations. About 60% of eligible people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated, according to federal figures. </p><p>   Vaccination requirements have been accelerating in the U.S. despite some public resistance and efforts by states such as Arkansas to ban vaccine mandates. Some laws prohibiting vaccination mandates are tied only to vaccinations that have emergency-use authorization, so they might not apply now to the Pfizer shot. </p><p>   \"Today I'm calling on more companies in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people,\" President Biden said. \"I call on you to do that -- require it.\" </p><p>   Employers including Walmart Inc., Tyson Foods Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. are requiring some employees to be vaccinated unless they have approved exceptions. </p><p>   Of the three authorized vaccines in the U.S., only Pfizer had submitted all the required information to the FDA for full approval. Moderna, whose two-dose shot uses similar mRNA technology as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, has said it is still completing rolling data submissions. J&amp;J, whose shot was authorized for emergency use in February, has said it plans to file for full approval later this year. </p><p>   The FDA's action came as U.S. hospitals are seeing a surge in cases tied to the  Delta variant, and as the government weighs when vaccinated adults should receive booster doses, putting pressure on the agency to act quickly. </p><p>   \"We have not lost sight that the Covid-19 public-health crisis continues in the U.S. and that the public is counting on safe and effective vaccines,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \"The public and medical community can be confident that although we approved this vaccine expeditiously, it was fully in keeping with our existing high standards for vaccines in the U.S.\" </p><p>   The FDA said its review found the vaccine to be safe and effective in preventing Covid-19 as well as severe disease, hospitalization and death. The most common side effects by clinical trial participants who received the vaccine included fatigue, headache, joint pain, chills and fever. </p><p>   The Pfizer-BioNTech shot got emergency-use authorization for children as young as 12 years in May. Pfizer plans to request full approval for that group once it has collected and analyzed six months of safety data from clinical-trial subjects, according to the company. </p><p>   The vaccine is now eligible for off-label prescriptions -- or use beyond the approved populations. That could include booster doses, according to the FDA. Prescribing the vaccine off label for children wouldn't be appropriate as there are no data on proper dosing or safety in youth, said acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. </p><p>   The age of the vaccine recipient must align with the FDA's guidelines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website. </p><p>   \"I am hopeful this approval will help increase confidence in our vaccine, as vaccination remains the best tool we have to help protect lives and achieve herd immunity,\" said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla. </p><p>   Dr. Marks, the FDA official, said the review showed an increased risk of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, after the second dose, although he didn't provide specific data on how frequently it occurs overall. He said it was mostly found in younger adult males. </p><p>   These reports are rare, the CDC has said. Since April, there have been more than a thousand reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of cases of inflammation of the heart happening after mRNA Covid-19 vaccinations in the U.S., according to the CDC. </p><p>   More than 92 million people in the U.S. have been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, and more than 204 million doses have been administered. (Not all people have gotten a second shot.) </p><p>   Dr. Marks said the FDA has heard false claims that Covid-19 vaccines cause infertility or contain microchips. \"Let me be clear, these claims are not true,\" he said. </p><p>   Pfizer and BioNTech submitted some 340,000 pages as part of their approval application -- more than three times the size of the emergency-use authorization submission -- and included longer-term clinical trial data from more than 46,000 volunteers that showed the vaccine was 91.1% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 up to six months after the second of two doses, according to Pfizer. </p><p>   The shot was authorized last year on an emergency basis after the companies showed the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic disease after two months. The emergency designation allows for products to be distributed during public-health crises based on the best available evidence. </p><p>   Eligible U.S. residents will continue to receive the vaccine at no cost, according to Pfizer. </p><p>   Pfizer, which will sell the vaccine under the name Comirnaty, plans to submit a request for booster authorization as an amendment to the full approval. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Alex Leary contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
