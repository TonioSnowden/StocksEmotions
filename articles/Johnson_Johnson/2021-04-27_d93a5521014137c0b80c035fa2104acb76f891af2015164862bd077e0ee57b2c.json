  "text": "<p>The agreement is the latest adding manufacturing capacity to increase supply. It is also a fresh example of industry collaboration in the effort to quickly scale up global production of Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>Novartis AG and Merck &amp; Co. are among those that have formed agreements to help make other companies' Covid-19 shots.</p><p>Moderna, of Cambridge, Mass., plans to deliver a cumulative total of 300 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine for use in the U.S. by the end of July, which is expected to help meet President Biden's goal of vaccinating the majority of American adults by summer.</p><p>Pfizer Inc. with partner BioNTech SE and Johnson &amp; Johnson also are supplying vaccine doses to help meet that goal. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are given as two doses a few weeks apart, while J&amp;J's is a single shot.</p><p>Because Sanofi's contribution isn't due to start until September, the Moderna vaccine doses it helps make might be directed toward vaccinating children under 18 years old, assuming the vaccine becomes authorized for them, or for booster shots if they are needed to sustain immunity among adults.</p><p>It is also possible the Sanofi capacity could be used for Moderna's modified Covid-19 vaccines that are targeting newer variants of the coronavirus. Moderna is testing one such vaccine in a clinical trial, and has said it might be able to file for regulatory authorization of the shot in the third quarter.</p><p>A spokesman for Moderna said the company can't specify which products Sanofi will handle or in which proportions.</p>",
