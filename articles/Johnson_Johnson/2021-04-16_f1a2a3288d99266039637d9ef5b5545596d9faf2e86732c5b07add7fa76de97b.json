  "title": "Economy Picks Up As Jobs, Spending Improve --- Stimulus, vaccinations provide boost while layoffs fall; retail sales jumped 9.8% in March",
  "text": "<p>Stocks rose on the economic news and strong earnings from blue-chip companies with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 34000 for the first time.</p><p>Separately, nearly 200,000 fewer workers filed for initial unemployment benefits last week. Jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, fell to 576,000 last week from 769,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said. While claims are still above levels that prevailed early last year, last week's figure was the lowest since March 2020. The total number of people receiving benefits also fell across a range of state and federal pandemic-related programs.</p><p>The government also reported Thursday that industrial production -- a measure of factory, mining and utility output -- rebounded in March after a decline in February. Factory output, which rose 2.7% over the month, helped drive the gain.</p><p>The economic readings taken together reflect \"people going back to work, people seeing more income, people spending. This is a good story about the American economy's resilience,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.</p><p>The gains in retail sales last month were broad-based, and showed a robust spending pickup in some categories that suffered early in the pandemic as people stayed at home to avoid the coronavirus.</p><p>Sales at restaurants and bars, for example, jumped 13.4% last month from February and 36% from March 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>Retail sales also jumped at clothing and department stores last month, which could reflect people seeking to refresh their wardrobes as they resume activities outside the home, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America.</p><p>\"The reopening progressed throughout March, with more and more states easing restrictions, more and more people becoming vaccinated and feeling comfortable re-engaging in the economy and activities that they did previously,\" Ms. Meyer said.</p><p>Meanwhile, sales at grocery stores -- which surged at the pandemic's onset amid state and local government lockdown orders -- increased just 0.5% on the month and fell sharply over the year, by 13.8%.</p><p>PepsiCo Inc., for instance, expects sales growth of oatmeal, pancakes and other packaged foods to slow in the second quarter as more people become vaccinated and consumers cook less at home. The company's Quaker Foods North America unit, which sells Rice-A-Roni and Cheetos Mac 'n Cheese, benefited more from the pandemic than the company's chips and beverage businesses, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said.</p><p>An average of about 2.9 million vaccine doses were administered daily across the U.S. in the seven days ended April 9, compared with about two million at the beginning of March, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A pause this week in the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot is expected to have a limited impact.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. consumer confidence is at its highest levels since the pandemic began.</p><p>The federal government has since mid-March disbursed about 159 million stimulus payments of more than $376 billion to households from the latest virus-aid package, the Treasury Department said this week.</p><p>The U.S. labor market is also showing signs of healing. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, declined last week to a pandemic low of 683,000.</p><p>The total number of people receiving unemployment assistance also fell. About 16.9 million people were collecting unemployment benefits through state and federal programs in the week ended March 27, down from 18.2 million a week earlier.</p><p>Still, the economy in March had 8.4 million fewer jobs than just before the pandemic hit, underscoring how government aid has boosted consumers' ability to spend, said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp.</p><p>\"The story is that there's a lot of financial support in the household sector, even though the level of employment is still so far below where it was prior to the pandemic,\" Mr. Moody said.</p><p>Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that people planned to use or were using nearly a quarter of the latest federal stimulus payments for spending on essential and nonessential items, while directing the remainder of the funds toward savings or paying down debt. The Fed survey also showed people intended to spend less of the most recent stimulus money than in two earlier rounds.</p><p>Bank of America data tracking credit- and debit-card spending showed consumers in March sharply increased spending on clothing and furniture and at department stores and restaurants.</p><p>Similarly, figures from Earnest Research, a data analytics company that tracks card spending, showed that consumer spending was up 29% in March compared with February and up 24% last month compared with the same period last year.</p><p>With increased vaccine circulation and Covid-19 cases retreating from recent peaks at the end of 2020 and into early 2021, many states have eased restrictions on businesses by, for example, reversing bans or loosening limits on indoor dining.</p><p>Scott Allen Frost, president of Las Vegas-based Titan Brands Hospitality Group, said the rollout of stimulus funds to households last month coincided with a relaxing of state mandates that allowed restaurants, including the three he oversees, to operate at increased capacity.</p><p>\"You couldn't have timed March better,\" Mr. Frost said. \"All this pent-up demand came roaring back.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Sarah Chaney and Jennifer Maloney contributed to this article.</p>",
