  "title": "U.S. Supports Patent Waivers To Produce Covid-19 Vaccines",
  "text": "<p>\"The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,\" Ms. Tai said Wednesday.</p><p>The waiver has been pushed by countries including India and South Africa that are suffering from an explosion in new cases. In India, it was reported recently that less than 2% of the population had been vaccinated, and new Covid-19 cases are at record highs globally as the pandemic rages unchecked in many poor and middle-income countries.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies, however, said the waiver won't provide the short-term results proponents think it will -- in part because of the challenge of setting up complex new production facilities to manufacture the vaccines.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobbying and trade group, said the Biden administration's decision will weaken already-strained supply chains and spur counterfeit vaccines.</p><p>\"This decision does nothing to address the real challenges to getting more shots in arms, including last-mile distribution and limited availability of raw materials,\" PhRMA said.</p><p>Pfizer Inc., which partnered with BioNTech SE to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, declined to comment. Representatives for Moderna Inc., AstraZeneca PLC and Johnson &amp; Johnson didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Moderna shares fell 6%, but Pfizer rebounded from a drop to finish flat. J&amp;J edged down 0.4%. American depositary receipts of AstraZeneca rose 1.36%; BioNTech was off 3.45%.</p><p>Ms. Tai warned that the talks at WTO to approve a waiver policy would take time given the consensus-based nature of the group, but that the U.S. would actively participate in negotiations.</p><p>Lifting patent restrictions would mean that rival companies would essentially be able to manufacture vaccines using the public patents without risk of legal challenges by the Covid-19 vaccine makers, said Zachary Silbersher, a patent lawyer at Markman Advisors LLC.</p><p>Manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccines is a complex scientific process that involves securing hard-to-find raw materials and scaling them in a way that has never been done before, according to industry experts. Factories must be built or retrofitted with special, expensive equipment and employees must have the manufacturing know-how.</p><p>\"I can't imagine that waiving patent rights is all of a sudden going to create competitors overnight,\" Mr. Silbersher said. \"Even if you're armed with the patents that doesn't mean you have all the information to make these vaccines. There's a gap and that gap could be significant.\"</p><p>In an interview Tuesday, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said it doesn't make sense to share patents because it wouldn't lead to increased production of vaccine doses.</p><p>\"It is so wrong,\" Mr. Bourla said of forcing the patent sharing. He said the limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines stems from how before the pandemic, there weren't any approved products using the new gene-based mRNA technology in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.</p><p>Pfizer, he said, has been ramping up its manufacturing capabilities to close that production gap for more than a year. Dictating the sharing of patents would discourage biotech companies from developing products for the next pandemic, he said.</p><p>Moderna said last year it wouldn't enforce patents related to its experimental Covid-19 vaccine while the pandemic continues and is willing to license the patents to others after the pandemic.</p><p>The U.S., members of the European Union and other wealthy nations were among the countries that opposed the original waiver proposal offered by South Africa and India in October, saying IP protection provides an important incentive for innovation to develop products to fight the current and future pandemics.</p><p>Ms. Tai said the support for the IP waiver is just one part of Washington's effort to get vaccines around the world quickly.</p><p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, hailed the U.S. action as a \"monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19.\"</p><p>PhRMA said that Covid-19 vaccine production was already ramping up and companies were exporting more shots overseas.</p><p>The move by the Biden administration came as the flare-up of the pandemic in India underscores the risks of the virus and emerging variants pose for the world.</p><p>Governments and other health experts have called for sharing patent rights to help spur additional production of vaccines around the world, particularly in developing nations where few people have received shots.</p>",
