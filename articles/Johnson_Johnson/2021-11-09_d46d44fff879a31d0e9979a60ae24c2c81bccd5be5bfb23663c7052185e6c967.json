  "title": "Business News: State Farm Cuts Back on Ads That Feature Aaron Rodgers",
  "text": "<p>State Farm ads featuring Mr. Rodgers also declined on Saturday, with Mr. Rodgers appearing in less than 2% of ads compared with 13% and 15%, respectively, the two previous Saturdays.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers became the center of controversy last week when he tested positive for Covid-19 and was placed into the league's protocols for unvaccinated players. That came after he was asked earlier in the year if he was vaccinated, to which he replied: \"Yeah, I'm immunized.\"</p><p>After testing positive, Mr. Rodgers went on a sports talk show to criticizethe NFL and the policies it has implemented to prevent the spread of the virus, saying they weren't rooted in science and treated vaccinated and unvaccinated players differently. The vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness while also reducing transmission and spread.</p><p>A State Farm spokeswoman didn't confirm whether the insurance company pulled some of its ads featuring Mr. Rodgers. \"We constantly review our marketing strategies and adjust advertising placements,\" she said.</p><p>\"Aaron Rodgers has been a great ambassador for our company for much of the past decade. We don't support some of the statements that he has made, but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view,\" the State Farm spokeswoman said in a statement.</p><p>\"We encourage vaccinations, but respect everyone's right to make a choice based on their personal circumstances,\" she added.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers wasn't available for comment.</p><p>In prior weeks, State Farm ads featuring Mr. Rodgers appeared on NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS, among other national TV networks. This past weekend, they mostly appeared on specialized sports networks such as NBC Sports, Golf Channel and Bally Sports, \"with no Rodgers-specific [ads] on network television,\" Apex President Eric Smallwood said in an interview.</p><p>\"There was a substantial shift in removing the Rodgers spots\" and replacing them with old ads, such as those featuring Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Mr. Smallwood said. Apex only has data on State Farm ads featuring Mr. Rodgers going back to Oct. 23.</p><p>Also over the weekend, Wisconsin healthcare provider Prevea Health said it was ending its partnership with the Green Bay Packers quarterback, who served as a spokesman promoting the group's health initiatives since 2012. The organization said in a statement on Saturday that it is committed to protecting patients and staff, including through helping eligible populations become vaccinated against Covid-19.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers said his decision to not receive one of the three vaccines approved in the U.S. was based on extensive research about what was best for his body. He claimed that he was allergic to the vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., and didn't trust the one-shot vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson. He didn't specify his allergy.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
