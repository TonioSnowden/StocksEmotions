  "title": "Opioid Manufacturers Score Win in California Lawsuit; Ruling is a rare victory for pharmaceutical companies in a wave of nationwide litigation over the opioid crisis",
  "text": "<p>The California lawsuit, filed in May 2014, was one of the first of thousands of similar actions filed by states, local governments and Native American tribes. The litigation broadly alleges that drugmakers manufactured powerful painkillers too broadly and that distributors didn't do enough to halt shipments that went beyond communities' medical needs.</p><p>The governments have been seeking to win money to use on social services to address the harms of opioid addiction and to fund first responders. The four plaintiffs in the California case—the counties of Orange, Santa Clara and Los Angeles and the city of Oakland—had hoped to be awarded billions of dollars.</p><p>Prescription and illegal opioids have killed nearly 500,000 people since 1999, according to federal data.</p><p>The companies have argued that they made federally-regulated products that helped people in pain and not responsible for causing widespread opioid addiction. Three large distributors and Johnson &amp; Johnson recently agreed to pay as much as $26 billion to settle the majority of the lawsuits they face. Other trials are ongoing or awaiting rulings in New York, West Virginia and Ohio.</p><p>Judge Peter Wilson said his conclusions address \"the question of liability based on the evidence in this trial, and are in no manner intended to ignore or minimize the existence and extent of the ongoing opioid crisis.\"</p><p>Judge Wilson said in the ruling that both sides broadly acknowledge the existence of an opioid crisis in California and the United States. He wrote that he disagreed with the plaintiffs' premise that they could prove their case by showing the number of opioid prescriptions increased without having to show how many were medically unnecessary.</p><p>\"There is simply no evidence to show that the rise in prescriptions was not the result of the medically appropriate provision of pain medications to patients in need,\" the ruling reads. Judge Wilson said he saw no evidence that misleading marketing on the part of the defendants—including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and AbbVie Inc.'s Allergan—drove doctors to write unnecessary prescriptions that caused a public nuisance.</p><p>The ruling is considered tentative, a routine step in California courts before final rulings, which usually reflect the same conclusions.</p><p>Liability Over the Opioid Epidemic</p><p>More WSJ coverage, selected by the editors</p><p>* Mallinckrodt Kicks Off Defense of $1.7 Billion Opioid Settlement</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said Monday night that the company recognizes that \"the opioid crisis is a tremendously complex public health issue\" but that the decision reflects that its marketing and promotion \"were appropriate and reasonable.\"</p><p>Endo similarly said it didn't make false or misleading statements and that its \"lawful conduct did not cause the widespread public nuisance\" at issue in the lawsuit. Teva said it is pleased with the ruling but continues to seek a national deal to end the lawsuits because \"a clear win for the many patients in the U.S. who suffer from opioid addiction will only come when comprehensive settlements are finalized.\"</p><p>AbbVie didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A group of plaintiffs' lawyers that has led the opioid litigation nationally said Monday they strongly disagree with the decision and that an appeal can be pursued to \"ensure no opioid manufacturer can engage in reckless corporate practices that compromise public health in the state for their own profit.\"</p><p>The California trial began in April and, because of the coronavirus pandemic, was held fully over videoconference. Judge Wilson alone weighed the evidence, presented over about three months, because neither side requested a jury.</p><p>Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com</p><p>Opioid Manufacturers Score Win in California Lawsuit</p>",
