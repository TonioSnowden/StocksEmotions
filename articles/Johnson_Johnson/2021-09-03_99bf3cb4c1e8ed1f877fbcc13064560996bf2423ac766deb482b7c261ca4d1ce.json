  "text": "<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Wollensky and Acting Food and Drug Commissioner Janet Woodcock made the recommendation on Thursday in a meeting with Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, one of the people said.</p><p>The White House hasn't yet made a decision, the people said. Last month, the Biden administration said people who had been vaccinated for eight months or longer should get a booster starting Sept. 20.</p><p>The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the recommended delay, which the New York Times reported earlier.</p><p>Asked earlier this week about concerns the booster campaign was premature, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, \"This was a recommendation made by our nation's leading health experts based on mounds and mounds of data.\"</p><p>The Biden administration has sought boosters to counter contagious variants like Delta and correct signs of waning immunity among the vaccinated, though evidence supporting the need for an extra dose, at least in the general public, isn't conclusive.</p><p>Federal health officials told the White House on Thursday they may not be able by Sept. 20 to make a decision clearing boosters for vaccines other than the one from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE.</p><p>The initial Pfizer campaign, if it does start the week of Sept. 20, may also need to be scaled back to include higher risk groups such as nursing home residents, healthcare workers and people over 65, the people said.</p><p>One issue stalling the discussions, the person said, is trying to figure out whether the Moderna vaccine booster should be a 50 microgram dose or the 100 microgram dose used for the first two shots.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Moderna is advocating for 50 micrograms while some in government favor 100 micrograms amid uncertainty because of durability concerns.</p><p>The second issue, the person said, is figuring what the right boosting interval for the single dose J&amp;J shot is.</p><p>Tarini Parti contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Vaccine Booster Launch Could Be Delayed</p>",
