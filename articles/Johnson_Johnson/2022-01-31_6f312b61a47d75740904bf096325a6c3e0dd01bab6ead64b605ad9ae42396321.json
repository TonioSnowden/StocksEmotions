  "title": "Biotech stocks had a challenging year, but that doesn't mean they're ‘necessarily on sale,' J&J exec tells investors",
  "text": "<p>“It's really hard to say whether there's been a capitulation or a recognition that values have come down,” J&amp;J CFO Joseph Wolk said Tuesday, according to a FactSet transcript of the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. “We probably need to see a little bit longer period of that. I don't think things are out there necessarily on sale.”</p><p>Wolk made his remarks after J&amp;J CEO Joaquin Duato told investors that the company is considering smaller, tuck-in deals before it moves forward with plans in 2023 to split the company into two businesses: one focused on consumer health, and the other on medical devices and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>“Our position in cash today makes us be more aggressive in that area,” Duato said, noting that the company will be in a net cash position for the first time in four years.</p><p>Many large pharmaceutical companies reported record performances in 2021, whether that's a decade-high stock price or shares that outperformed the broader market as investors continued to pour money into companies making COVID-19 vaccines and treatments last year. Biotechs, on the hand, have seen few of those gains.</p><p>Pfizer Inc. PFE, which makes a COVID-19 vaccine with BioNTech SE BNTX and an COVID-19 antiviral, Paxlovid, saw its stock soar 45.1% over the past year, while Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, which makes monoclonal antibody treatments, watched its shares go up 17.4%. J&amp;J's stock hit a 10-year high of $179.47 on Aug. 17. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index DRG is up 7.0% over the past year.</p><p>But the biotech sector largely lagged behind its pharma peers in 2021.</p><p>Over the past year, the iShares Biotechnology ETF IBB declined 23.3%, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index NBI fell 20.4%, and the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETFXBI tumbled 41.9%; the broader S&amp;P 500 SPX, however, is up 13.0%.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>“Biotech performance continues to be challenged in 2022,” BMO Research analysts said Tuesday. “Sentiment could be helped if guides are good and talk of M&amp;A remains.”</p><p>Merger-and-acquisition activity and value in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors has dwindled over the past two years. There were 69 deals worth $128 billion in 2020 and 90 deals worth $108 billion in 2021, according to EY. That's significantly down from 2019, which had 70 deals worth $261 billion.</p><p>That said, Wall Street still sees moneymaking potential in some of the hundreds of publicly traded biotech companies.</p><p>“Biotechs that are in the clinic vs. preclinical, deeper in the clinic vs. earlier in the clinic, or have validated strategies/science (and you can still have this pre-clinically to a degree) vs. making bets where pathology is less understood could all potentially be 2022 beneficiaries of biotech's 2021 underperformance,” Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed told investors in a Jan. 19 note.</p>",
