Record-setting trade for equities have come against the backdrop of rising inflation that has been blamed on supply chain bottlenecks and spiking demand which the Federal Reserve has consistently described as likely transitory.</p><p>Growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairmain Jerome Powell won't explicitly declare plans for tapering market-favorable bond purchases at the end of this week, at a virtual economic symposium of central bankers hosted by the Kansas City Federal Reserve, also has helped to buttress buying attitudes on Wall Street.</p><p>“This week's rebound in stocks has been largely predicated on last week's shift in tone by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, in suggesting he could shift his position on a taper if the economic data deteriorated, a not unreasonable position to take,” said Michael Hewson, an analyst at broker CMC Markets.</p><p>In economic news, orders for durable goods, those lasting at least three years, slipped 0.1% last month, marking the second time in 15 months,&#xa0;the government said Wednesday.

Demand was strong in other parts of the economy despite widespread shortages of materials and labor.</p><p>On top of that, House Democrats approved a $3.5 trillion budget resolution and advanced the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which could be viewed as adding further support to the U.S. economy.</p><p>“While the process has been protracted, yesterday showed that the fiscal-stimulus-train remains on track for the U.S. economy for the time being, and we should have a better idea of exactly how large the final package will be in a matter of weeks,” said Henry Allen, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>In Asia, “risk appetite has weakened with markets trading lower for the most part” noted Allen, highlighting that Japan will extend a state of emergency due to COVID-19 to eight more of its 47 prefectures, bringing the total number under restrictions lasting until mid-September to 21.</p><p>A Bank of Japan policymaker also warned that the global semiconductor shortage could last through the rest of 2021 if Southeast Asian factories remain shuttered due to COVID-19 outbreaks.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Ifo business climate index, highlighted the weakness of Germany's economy relative to European peers,&#xa0;declining for the second month in a row&#xa0;in August, underscoring lingering concerns about the spread of the delta variant.</p><p>“Germany's leading indicator joins the choir of recently released leading indicators pointing to a loss of momentum in the German economy,” said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING bank.</p><p>In COVID news, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ shared interim clinical data that indicates Americans who have received its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine should get a second dose. The company said that two studies examining people who had received its shot found that a second dose boosted antibody levels.
