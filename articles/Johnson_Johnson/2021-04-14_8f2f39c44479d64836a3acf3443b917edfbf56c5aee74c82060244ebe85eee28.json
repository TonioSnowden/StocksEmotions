  "text": "<p>The EU will edge closer on Wednesday to agreeing a common certification system, allowing travellers to start planning their summer holidays. </p> <p>Brussels' clunkily named “digital green certificate” is due to win EU ambassadors' approval, paving the way for negotiations to start with the European parliament. </p> <p>Agreeing the rules is a race against time for member states where tourism industries have been battered by the pandemic. Southern hotspots such as Greece want an EU-wide agreement as soon as possible to give maximum certainty to potential tourists that they will be able to plan summer getaways. But such is the nature of the Brussels machinery that formal rubber-stamping may not happen until June. </p> <p>EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders on Tuesday was at pains to stress that the scheme would not be an EU “vaccines passport”. </p> <p>“The proposal aims to clarify that vaccination is not a precondition for free movement,” Reynders told MEPs. </p> <p>Governments including France and Reynders' native Belgium have been wary of promoting the scheme as a travel pass that would give superior freedom of movement privileges to those who have been vaccinated — arguing that doing so would discriminate against younger people who are at the back of the queue for jabs. </p> <p>Such are the sensitivities around the rules that Brussels was forced to change the name of the scheme from a “green pass” to a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed6e9de4-f48e-4d74-97d1-ee80ab8f1a2f\">green certificate</a>” to avoid any connotation with travel.</p> <p>“Possession of a digital green certificate is no precondition for exercising freedom of movement rights”, according to a draft legal text seen by the FT. </p> <p>Under the system, Europeans would need to provide either evidence of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test to travel. The certificate could also be granted if travellers had proof of recovery from the virus and the presence of antibodies, according to the draft text. Countries would also be given the flexibility to decide whether or not to recognise vaccines not yet approved by EU regulators — such as Russia's Sputnik V — as valid under the certificate. </p> <p>But the EU plan has a few more hurdles to pass. MEPs are due to agree on their draft rules this month and the parliament would need to vote on a final compromise text in late May. </p> <p>In the meantime, member states are beginning to trial their own mini-systems as vaccinations speed up across the continent. Denmark is trialling a digital “corona pass” to allow vaccinated people or those with antibodies to visit non-essential shops. France has also rolled out a limited vaccine passport for Air France flights between France, Guadeloupe and Martinique. </p> <p>Despite Brussels' attempts to rapidly set up a common system in time for the tourist season, the EU certificate will come too late for some. Recognising the delay, Brussels will allow governments to forge ahead with national schemes until the co-ordinated European system becomes a reality. </p> <h1>Chart du jour: Deutsche Back</h1> <p>Deutsche Bank, once the “sick bank of Europe”, is outstripping European rivals in the equity market (see <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c478d11-6ed2-4c68-870d-3d0e97f76745\">share price chart via FT</a>). The German bank still has a long way to go before it can compete with US giants and has remaining fat to be cut in jobs and unwanted assets, but boss Christian Sewing's efforts at dodging the worst of scandals such as Wirecard seem to be paying off.</p> <h1> Planet Europe</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Europe's vaccination drive has received another blow, after US drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would delay the rollout of its one-shot jab in the bloc after suspending it in the US over reports of blood clots. The J&amp;J vaccine forms a significant part of the EU's vaccine portfolio, with up to 400m doses on order. The drug company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55f0ecff-5839-4809-9c74-d729e6060e00\">warned in March</a> that the deployment of its vaccine across the continent would be slower than expected.

The row rumbled on with both aspirants showing no signs of bowing out of the race. </p></li>  <li><p>Russia has lobbed a diplomatic salvo at the EU, accusing the bloc of damaging fragile talks on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/218bd3ad-c5ad-4990-bb15-dca90bdcf7d0\">Iran nuclear deal</a> by imposing sanctions against Tehran over human rights abuses. Russian rhetoric is also heating up over Ukraine, with western allies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afe82676-43fd-4826-9c57-b383399059ec#myft:my-news:page\">increasingly worried</a> that Moscow may intervene in the country's eastern border regions.

But an <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/2021/04/is-the-european-unions-investment-agreement-with-china-underrated/\">analysis by think-tank Bruegel</a> suggests the deal might be better than most believe, with rules that would integrate Beijing into global trade making CAI “worth having”. </p></li> </ul> <h1>Coming up today </h1> <p>EU budget commissioner Johannes Hahn will present the EU's strategy on how it plans to raise €800bn on capital markets for the post-Covid-19 recovery (11.00 CET). </p> <p>The EU's general court will rule on Wednesday morning on Ryanair's legal challenge against national state aid schemes to competitors in Denmark and Finland.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mehreen.khan@ft.com\"><em>mehreen.khan@ft.com</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehreenkhn\"><em>@</em>MehreenKhn</a><br><a href=\"mailto:david.hindley@ft.com\"><em>david.hindley@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Mehreen Khan in Brussels and David Hindley in London  2021 'EU plans ticket to ride for battered tourism industry ' FT.com 14 April.
