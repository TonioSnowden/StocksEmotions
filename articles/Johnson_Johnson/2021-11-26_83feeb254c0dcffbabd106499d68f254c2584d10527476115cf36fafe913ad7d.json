  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 Vaccine Recipients Often Shift to Other Boosters; In contrast, most people who originally received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines have stuck with the same shots if they got boosters",
  "text": "<p>So far, about 1.7 million people of the 15.7 million who originally got J&amp;J's single-dose vaccine have received a booster. Of these, 26% stayed with J&amp;J for their second dose through Wednesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The rest of those originally immunized with J&amp;J's shot and later got boosters received other drugmakers' vaccines. Some 43% got the Moderna Inc. vaccine, the CDC said, while 31% received a booster from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE.</p><p>In contrast, the majority of people who originally received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines—both of which were rolled out as two-dose regimens—have stuck with the same shots if they got boosters.</p><p>Some 96% of people fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine who also got boosters received that same shot, while 94% stuck with Moderna through Wednesday, according to the CDC.</p><p>A J&amp;J spokesman said the company's vaccine provides protection against symptomatic Covid-19, both as a single dose for an efficient response to the pandemic and as a booster dose.</p><p>Jessica Gálvez received the J&amp;J vaccine in April, when it was the only one available at a vaccination site near her home in Sun Valley, Calif. Six months later, in October, the 29-year-old yoga instructor began to hear about booster shots becoming available. Ms. Gálvez saw charts posted on Twitter by doctors and epidemiologists about the results of a government-funded study.</p><p>\"For the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Moderna provided the best amount of antibodies,\" she said. \"That was sort of where I decided to go with Moderna.\"</p><p>She said she felt mild fatigue the day after her booster but it didn't last long. Now she feels more prepared for the holidays, she said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If you got J&amp;J for your original vaccine, what are you choosing for your booster shot, and why? Join the conversation below.</p><p>A similar divergence is occurring in the U.K. There, the vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC, which played a key role in the initial vaccine rollout, has been sidelined in favor of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the booster campaign.</p><p>The preference for the latter shot was based in part on an unpublished study that compared boosting with various vaccines. The U.K. government didn't share the details of the study but said the research provided good evidence that the Pfizer shot would provide a strong booster response.</p><p>Since September, U.S. health regulators have cleared booster doses of all three authorized vaccines for many adults, including the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots. And authorities have permitted people to choose a different vaccine for their boosters than the vaccine they originally received.</p><p>The booster shots are intended to address waning immunity conferred by the original vaccines and to shore up protection from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.</p><p>About 19.1% of fully vaccinated people in the U.S. have gotten booster doses as of Wednesday, CDC data show. The percentage is higher for older adults, with 42.1% of fully vaccinated people ages 65 and older having received boosts as of Nov. 23.</p><p>More than 108 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and 19.2 million of them received a third dose. Of the more than 71 million who were fully vaccinated with Moderna's shot, 13.9 million have received a third dose.</p><p>The defections from J&amp;J's vaccine might partly reflect studies showing that it is less effective at preventing Covid-19 than the other U.S.-authorized shots.</p><p>One CDC study found that effectiveness at preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. was 93% for Moderna, 88% for Pfizer-BioNTech and 71% for J&amp;J, between March and August.</p><p>Also, a study of \"mixing and matching\" vaccines showed that J&amp;J recipients' antibody levels would get a bigger boost from either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots than from another J&amp;J dose. The study was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p><p>\"You're going to be protected if you get a second dose of the J&amp;J\" vaccine, said Kirsten Lyke, a professor of medicine at University of Maryland School of Medicine and co-author of the NIAID-funded study.</p><p>\"But you also might get a very strong antibody response if you go ahead and get one of the mRNA's, having received a single dose of J&amp;J,\" she said, referring to messenger RNA, the key component of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.</p><p>Mathai Mammen, head of research and development for J&amp;J's pharmaceutical unit, said it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the NIAID-sponsored study about J&amp;J's booster. The study tracked the effect of booster shots on antibody levels but not on other elements of the immune system that J&amp;J's vaccine might enhance. \"For us, the data are not mature,\" he said.</p><p>A separate, J&amp;J-sponsored study showed that giving a second dose of its vaccine about two months after the first dose was 94% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in the U.S.</p><p>Safety considerations also might play a role in booster choice, according to doctors and researchers.</p><p>A rare but serious blood-clotting condition has been reported in a small number of recipients of the J&amp;J vaccine, primarily in women younger than 50. U.S. health authorities say that the benefits of J&amp;J's vaccine outweigh any risks, including the clots, but that women under 50 should be aware of the risks as well as the option to get other vaccines.</p><p>Dr. Lyke said some women might feel more comfortable choosing an mRNA-based shot for their booster because those haven't been associated with the increased risk of the rare clotting condition.</p><p>\"They can have a little more peace of mind if they want to switch to mRNA,\" she said.</p><p>Conversely, some young men who originally received a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine might choose to get a J&amp;J booster dose because the mRNA shots have been associated with an elevated risk of heart-inflammation conditions, including myocarditis in males under 30, Dr. Lyke said.</p><p>U.S. health authorities say any adult 18 years and older who was first vaccinated with J&amp;J's single shot should get a booster of any vaccine at least two months later. They have also said that any adult who received the original two doses of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines may get a booster at least six months after the second dose.</p><p>Denise Roland contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 Vaccine Recipients Often Shift to Other Boosters</p>",
