  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine sales are lagging behind its peers. That shouldn't bother its shareholders. </p><p>\n  The healthcare giant reported third-quarter vaccine sales of $502 million, which fell short of analyst expectations. J&amp;J has booked $766 million of vaccine revenue so far this year, which is a fraction of that generated by rivals like Pfizer and Moderna. Shares sit about 9% off their late-summer highs. </p><p>\n  Like many drug stocks, J&amp;J shares have often traded higher or lower based on vaccine news since the pandemic began. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said that he finds the focus on the vaccine's commercial success \"baffling.\" The shot has played a major role in public-health efforts, but for the full year, Covid-19 vaccine sales are expected to account for less than 3% of the company's top line. Besides, J&amp;J is selling those vaccines on a nonprofit basis through the rest of the year. </p><p>\n  That trading pattern may be starting to change, as J&amp;J shares rose 2% in trading Tuesday. The strong performance of the rest of the business means that rally ought to stick. Sales in its medical-device unit grew 8% from a year earlier, despite a drop in U.S. elective medical-procedure volume as the Delta variant spread and hospitals experienced labor shortages. Sales in its pharmaceuticals unit grew by 14%, or about 9% excluding the vaccine, while its consumer health segment grew by 5%. </p><p>\n  Those results should continue to improve as life returns closer to a pre-pandemic normal. Cold and flu medicine sales will likely be stronger this winter, and more patients returning to doctors offices and hospitals for routine care should boost device and pharmaceutical revenue. J&amp;J raised its 2021 adjusted profit outlook by 15 cents to a range of $9.77 to $9.82 a share. Shares trade at about 16 times that forecast, which is hardly expensive in this market. And since the company has developed a reputation for conservative guidance, actual profit might well be higher. </p><p>\n  In this case, Wall Street's vaccine tunnel vision has granted investors a chance to buy a blue-chip stock at a discount. </p><p></p>",
