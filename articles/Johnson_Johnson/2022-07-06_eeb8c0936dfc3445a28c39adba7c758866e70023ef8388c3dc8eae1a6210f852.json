  "title": "Opioid Distributors Win a Case  ----  By Corinne Ramey and Sara Randazzo",
  "text": "<p>   A federal judge ruled that three large drug distributors couldn't be held liable for the opioid crisis in a West Virginia city and county. </p><p>   U.S. District Judge David Faber rejected arguments by Cabell County and the city of Huntington that the distributors should be held liable for the public-health crisis because they ignored evidence that prescription drugs were being diverted for illegal use. </p><p>   \"While there is a natural tendency to assign blame in such cases, they must be decided not based on sympathy, but on the facts and the law,\" Judge Faber wrote in a 184-page ruling on Monday. </p><p>   The judge said conduct by the distributors -- McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc. -- couldn't be deemed a public nuisance under the law because the plaintiffs didn't prove their actions caused the opioid crisis. He said overprescribing by doctors, dispensing of excessive prescriptions by pharmacists and diversion of the drugs to illegal usage were all \"intervening causes beyond the control of defendants.\" </p><p>   A bench trial in the case took place last year and was closely watched around the country as a test of public-nuisance claims by state and local governments seeking to hold companies up and down the opioid supply chain responsible for drug addiction. Thousands of similar cases against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies have had mixed success at trial and resulted in billions of dollars in settlements. </p><p>   The three distributors, plus drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson, have agreed to pay $26 billion to settle claims nationally, but West Virginia communities opted out of that deal to go their own way. </p><p>   Huntington Mayor Steve Williams said he was disappointed in the ruling. \"These companies were part of a powerful industry responsible for fueling the epidemic here in Huntington and across the country,\" he said. </p><p>   AmerisourceBergen said it was pleased with the court's decision. </p><p>   \"Pharmaceutical distributors like AmerisourceBergen have been asked to walk a legal and ethical tightrope between providing access to necessary medications and acting to prevent diversion of controlled substances,\" a spokesman said. </p><p>   A Cardinal Health spokesman said the company applauded the ruling and remained committed to being part of the solution to the opioid crisis. </p><p>   McKesson said that it maintains and continuously enhances programs designed to detect and prevent opioid diversion. </p><p>   Seventy witnesses testified at trial, including physicians, epidemiologists, company representatives and public officials. </p><p>   A judge in Orange County, Calif., last year rejected arguments that four drugmakers helped fuel the opioid crisis there. </p><p></p>",
