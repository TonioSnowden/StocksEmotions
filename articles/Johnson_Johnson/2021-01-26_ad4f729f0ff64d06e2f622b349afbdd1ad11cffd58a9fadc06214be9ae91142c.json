  "title": "Workers Producing the  Vaccine Need Vaccination  ----  By Robert Kramer",
  "text": "<p>   In the race to vaccinate people for Covid-19, everyone agrees front-line health workers, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions should get priority. But one vital group is being overlooked. Even worse, some are criticizing efforts to vaccinate them as some sort of effort to \"cut the line.\" </p><p>   I'm referring to the thousands of people working to produce critical vaccines, medications and diagnostics for Covid-19. In addition to Pfizer and Moderna, my company, Emergent BioSolutions, has been ramping up manufacturing of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for partners like Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca in close coordination with the federal government. </p><p>   Emergent's employees are essential to the Covid-19 response, and we have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect them. Unfortunately, our strict safety protocols, like the use of personal protective equipment, disinfection of work areas and regular testing, are no guarantee against infection. </p><p>   Over the past year, we have quarantined hundreds of team members -- nearly one-third of our small on-site workforce. Some were exposed outside the workplace, but the primary cause of quarantine is potential exposure to an infected fellow employee. This situation puts a tremendous strain on our 24/7 operations. Absenteeism means other employees have to work multiple back-to-back shifts to avoid a manufacturing shutdown. So far, we've avoided delays in vaccine production, but the risk is real -- we briefly had to slow down operations at another facility because of Covid-related absenteeism. </p><p>   This situation also can create a national-security risk. In addition to Covid-19 vaccines, Emergent produces medical countermeasures for deadly threats like anthrax, botulism and smallpox. This manufacturing can't simply be turned on and off. That's why the Department of Homeland Security has designated Emergent as a part of America's critical national-security infrastructure in cases of emergency. </p><p>   Since 2012, we have worked in partnership with the U.S. government to be prepared for rapid manufacturing in a pandemic. As we were ramping up last year, we worried about maintaining operations if employees or their immediate family members were infected or exposed. We discussed this with the government and understood that this risk would be mitigated by vaccinating this group as soon as a vaccine became available. </p><p>   Unfortunately states have categorized us with nonpharmaceutical manufacturers, outside the first phase of vaccine eligibility. As a result, our operations remain at risk, even as we ramp up production of hundreds of millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines. </p><p>   We continue to seek prioritization in the states where we operate -- California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi and Pennsylvania. We're also pursuing other avenues, including working directly with federal officials and vaccine manufacturers, to obtain the vaccine as quickly as possible. </p><p>   Given the urgent public-health and national-security implications of these risks, I urge the relevant authorities to immediately provide vaccine access to workers like ours, who are essential to the Covid response. Like nurses and firefighters, our colleagues are on the front lines of this fight. Protecting them will protect hundreds of millions of others. Prioritizing them is a necessary step. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Mr. Kramer is president and CEO of Emergent BioSolutions in Gaithersburg, Md. </p><p></p>",
