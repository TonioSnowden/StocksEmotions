  "text": "<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines saying that people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 could meet each other indoors without social distancing or masks.</p> <p>While the public health guidance on Monday carried no legal authority, it was the first big attempt by US health authorities to spell out how life could begin to return to normal.</p> <p>Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, said: “We believe these new recommendations are an important first step in our efforts to resuming everyday activities in our community.”</p> <p>CDC guidance has not previously distinguished between those who had been vaccinated and those who had not, recommending against indoor socialising, travelling and large gatherings for everyone. The announcement on Monday marks a departure from that stance.</p> <p>Under the guidelines, those who have been fully vaccinated can visit the houses of other fully-vaccinated people or houses where there is no one at high risk of the disease. </p> <p>“If grandparents have been vaccinated, they can visit their daughter and her family, even if they have not been vaccinated — as long as the daughter and her family are not at risk for severe disease,” Walensky said.</p> <p>She added that it would no longer be recommended that vaccinated people get tested and quarantine after coming into contact with someone who has the disease.</p> <p>However, the organisation continued to advise against non-essential travel or medium- or large-sized gatherings for anyone, whether or not they have been vaccinated.</p> <p>Andy Slavitt, a senior White House coronavirus adviser, said: “We've begun to describe what a world looks like where we move beyond Covid-19 . . . I think it's important to note that, as more and more people get vaccinated, that list of activities will continue to grow.”</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The US vaccinated a record 2.9m people on Saturday, Slavitt said, taking the total number of fully-vaccinated people to over 30m people, or 9 per cent of the population. </p> <p>Some 60m people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. While the BioNTech/Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines require two jabs, regulators also recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24719728-92bd-4c87-b4e2-a1a496b8229c\">authorised</a> the single-dose inoculation by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p> <p>According to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, the number of cases and deaths has continued to fall across the country, although Walensky warned there had been a “levelling off of the decline” in the last few days. </p> <p>Some public health officials have also been alarmed by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98e95403-341b-46ef-a16e-07b098524309\">rollback of restrictions</a> in states including Texas and Mississippi, which recently ended mask mandates and lifted business curbs as cases declined.</p> <p>Over the past seven days, there were an average of just under 60,000 cases a day, according to the <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/?areas=usa&amp;areasRegional=usny&amp;areasRegional=usnj&amp;areasRegional=usaz&amp;areasRegional=usca&amp;areasRegional=usnd&amp;areasRegional=ussd&amp;cumulative=0&amp;logScale=0&amp;per100K=0&amp;startDate=2020-09-01&amp;values=cases\">FT's coronavirus tracker</a> — close to the same level seen in October 2020.</p><p>Source: Kiran Stacey in Washington 2021 'Vaccinated Americans can socialise without masks, says CDC' FT.com 8 March.
