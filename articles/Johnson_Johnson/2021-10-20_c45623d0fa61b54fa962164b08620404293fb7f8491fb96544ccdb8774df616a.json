There are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6471af0-764d-49e7-87a0-dd2a2c110fd9\">antitrust interventions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76828bc9-e64f-446e-b03a-5f34df195bfa\">national security probes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cdb5387-61fd-4005-a2ae-72b03b86185f\">objections to foreign takeovers</a>. &#xa0;</p> <p>But bidding in an auction, while simultaneously suing the company they're trying to buy? Well, it's a new one for us.&#xa0;</p> <p>Particularly when the company is a port operator and the politician belongs to the British Conservative party, which has historically embraced the privatisation of infrastructure. </p> <p>Yet that's what the investment behemoth <strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fa92b7a-3418-4f3c-ae54-aa8c6fd279dd\">is grappling with as it tries</a> to sell <strong>PD Ports</strong>, a Middlesbrough-based port company it acquired out of the bankruptcy of Australia's <strong>Babcock &amp; Brown</strong> after the financial crisis. </p> <p><strong>Peel Ports</strong> and <strong>Macquarie</strong> are through to the final round of an auction process for the business, which Brookfield hopes to sell for as much as £2bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>But so is the <strong>South Tees Development Corporation</strong>, which is chaired by <strong>Ben Houchen</strong>, the 34-year-old Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, a region long dominated by the Labour party. </p> <p>That made him an important figure in Prime Minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>'s push to win votes in the north of England. (Johnson is “obsessed” with Houchen, according to a Downing Street insider.) </p> <p>Houchen wants the STDC to buy the site as part of the development of a government-backed, tax-advantaged freeport in the area. It's lined up <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> for debt financing, and <strong>Northumberland Estates</strong> and the <strong>Pension Insurance Corporation</strong> as potential backers. </p> <p>But his organisation isn't keen to pay £2bn. “Bids in the £1.1bn to £1.4bn range are far more realistic,” according to a person involved in the corporation's bid. </p> <p>As well as bidding, his STDC is suing PD Ports over its rights to use two access routes to its site. </p> <p>PD Ports says the lawsuit is designed “to extract a ransom discount” so it can buy the company on the cheap, an allegation the STDC has denied. </p> <p>The conflict sends a message that any future owner might have to contend with a difficult political backdrop. And that risks putting off other buyers.</p> <p>Peel Ports is not “filled with glee” at “the prospect of spending a year or two battling the mayor”, a person close to the company said. </p> <p>“Those factors are hindrances to progressing with the opportunity,” they said, and a deal valuing the company between £1.5bn and £2bn would risk becoming a “millstone” around the neck of the ports group. &#xa0;</p> <p>Separately, Macquarie has signalled to the corporation that it isn't keen to get in its way, and “will only put in a bid if they know relations will be smooth with the mayor”, a person with knowledge of the matter said. </p> <p>Final bids are due next month, and it's possible that other unknown bidders might be interested. But how will Brookfield deal with such a political curveball? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fa92b7a-3418-4f3c-ae54-aa8c6fd279dd\">Go deeper</a> with this piece from DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Sebastian Payne. </p> <h2>How faulty Pipes could threaten Spac deals&#xa0;</h2> <p>When the market in special purpose acquisition vehicles was booming earlier this year, there were two major culprits. </p> <p>The first were hedge funds, dubbed the “Spac mafia”, who were allocated shares at the initial public offering and typically either sold out at a profit or redeemed their cash when time came to vote on a deal. </p> <p>The second were investors such as <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Fidelity </strong>and <strong>Wellington</strong> <strong>Management</strong>, who were allocated shares through a so-called Pipe — short for private investment in public equity — and ploughed billions of dollars into Spac deals. </p> <p>The theory was that while hedge funds would probably sell or redeem, money from Pipe investors was stickier. </p> <p>They received a preview of the target company (after signing a non-disclosure agreement) and could decide if they wanted to invest. Their participation in the transaction was generally considered a stamp of approval on the company and its valuation from Wall Street. </p> <p>When the time came for Pipe investors to deliver the cash, they did so because they had signed an agreement saying that they would. </p> <p>As DD's Ortenca Aliaj <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6675ac1e-a9a0-48d8-b4e9-aee2ef27c7be\">explains</a>, that theory is now being put to the test. </p> <p><strong>The Metals Company</strong>, a Canadian start-up that hopes to mine the depths of the Pacific Ocean for rare earth metals to power electric vehicles, has been hung out to dry by its largest Pipe investor. </p> <p><strong>Ramas Capital Management</strong>, a small private equity firm registered to a residential address in River Oaks, Texas, has left a $200m hole in The Metals Company's books after it failed to deliver the cash. The mining group is seeking to recover the funds by suing Ramas Capital in New York's Supreme Court. </p> <p>The missing cash undermines The Metals Company's ambitions to mine cobalt and copper on the seafloor — the business will receive just over $100m in proceeds when it had expected $570m, after the majority of the Spac's shareholders opted to redeem their cash. </p> <p>It also casts doubt over the broader Spac model. Because everyone knows that shareholders can redeem, the Pipe money is relied upon as guaranteed funds for the company. If investors suddenly decide they're not going to deliver the cash, it could put many Spac deals in jeopardy. </p> <p>Remember: a lot of the companies going public through Spacs are high growth, early stage businesses so they really need the money.</p> <p>It also raises questions around due diligence and whether more scrutiny should be applied to relatively unknown investors contributing large sums of cash. &#xa0;</p> <h2>There will be blood</h2> <p>The distressed debt group at <strong>Elliott Management</strong> has a “go big and go hard” mantra. A power play it made in 2018 may well be about to pay off. </p> <p>Three years ago, an Elliott-led group of senior creditors at <strong>Claire's</strong>, the US retailer known for piercing the ears of young girls, took control of the company from <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>. </p> <p>The private equity firm had acquired Claire's for $3bn in 2007 but a decade later the mall chain had been crushed by a $2bn debt pile forcing it into a bankruptcy filing. </p> <p>As DD's Sujeet Indap <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6424124a-8715-4e1b-8b64-4d14223e881e\">describes</a>, an Elliott windfall may soon be realised and not just because Claire's is enjoying a surprise post-pandemic recovery.</p> <p>Elliott's exit financing package, which included a $250m preferred stock security through various financially engineered bells and whistles, may now be worth twice that. </p> <p>In the 2018 bankruptcy fight, <strong>Oaktree Capital Management</strong> objected to the Elliott gambit. Oaktree, whose junior bond position was crushed in the case, argued that the Elliott financing was “possibly improper or immoral”.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Elliott, unlike Oaktree, was able to quickly put together its bid for Claire's leaving little time for the grievances of others. Big money moving quickly tends to dominate high stakes Chapter 11 cases. </p> <p>At the emergence of bankruptcy, Claire's was worth $1.4bn. It recently filed an IPO prospectus which shows profits big enough that the company could now be worth perhaps $2.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>That jump is enough to make Elliott's founder <strong>Paul Singer</strong> a fortune and the clever structuring is only going to make the possible Claire's listing even more lucrative. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Raine Group</strong>, the advisory firm and merchant bank, has hired<strong> Bernard Mourad</strong> as a partner and is opening a new office in Paris where he will be based. Mourad is a former <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> banker who has worked closely with <strong>Patrick Drahi</strong>'s<strong> Altice</strong> and most recently as head of global corporate and investment banking at <strong>Bank of America</strong> in France. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Peter Toth</strong>, head of strategy and development at <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d06fbd88-c242-479f-9201-4587829c8f78\">is leaving</a> the company after eight years to join the gold miner <strong>Newmont</strong> in a similar role.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>KKR</strong> has appointed <strong>Ian Williamson</strong> to lead its “core plus” real estate activities in Europe, based in London. He joins from <strong>BlackRock</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>White &amp; Case</strong> has hired <strong>Robert Nield </strong>as a partner in its London M&amp;A practice. He joins the law firm from<strong> Sidley Austin</strong>. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>It takes a village </strong>A new industry of lawyers, publicists and researchers has emerged to help Big Tech whistleblowers achieve maximum impact.
