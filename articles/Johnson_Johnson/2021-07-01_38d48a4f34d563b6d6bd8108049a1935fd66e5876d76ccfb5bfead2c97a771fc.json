  "text": "<p>The loan would help Aspen reach production of 500 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2022, with the goal of vaccinating much of the African continent, said David Marchick, the DFC's chief operating officer. Aspen said late last year that it had reached a deal with J&amp;J to make 300 million doses.</p><p>Several African countries have received vaccine donations from Beijing since the pandemic's start. As China scales up vaccine manufacturing and inoculates much of its own population, it could be in position to export 340 million doses a month by September, according to research-firm Capital Economics.</p><p>Offering an alternative to China's vaccine diplomacy is a factor in financing Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing, U.S. officials said, though they said they are primarily driven by healthcare reasons. \"This is part of our broad strategy to help end the pandemic,\" Mr. Marchick said.</p><p>Much of the Covid-19 vaccine doses have gone to wealthy countries and only around 1.1% of Africa's 1.3 billion people are fully vaccinated, just as the continent is seeing a new surge of infections driven by the more-transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus.</p><p>Since opening doors during the Trump administration in 2019, the DFC, a development bank with an investment limit of $60 billion, has offered loans and other financial assistance to help Western businesses win contracts over Chinese-backed ones and counter Beijing's broader soft-diplomacy efforts.</p><p>Beyond healthcare, DFC is working to invest more in Africa, where many governments have entered into infrastructure and other deals with Chinese companies as part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative.</p>",
