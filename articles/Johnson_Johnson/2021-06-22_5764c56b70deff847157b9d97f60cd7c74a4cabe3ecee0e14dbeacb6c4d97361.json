  "text": "<p>   San Diego -- The best golfer in the world who had yet to win a major knew he had the perfect excuse if he fell short at the U.S. Open. </p><p>   \"Hey,\" Jon Rahm convinced himself. \"I had Covid.\" </p><p>   Over the course of 15 days, Rahm rode a pandemic roller coaster unlike anything else in sports since the onset of the pandemic. He received the results of a positive Covid-19 test on national television when he was on the verge of winning another tournament. Instead of collecting a $1.7 million prize, he quarantined. And this weekend he emerged in the most dramatic way possible: Rahm actually won the U.S. Open. </p><p>   Rahm, the No. 3 ranked golfer entering the tournament, prevailed for his first major with a 6-under-par performance at Torrey Pines. The 26-year-old Spaniard became his country's first player to win the U.S. Open by sinking back-to-back birdie putts on the 17th and 18th holes, electrifying galleries and eliciting roars that carried across the grounds. </p><p>   The only thing crazier than his finish was everything that happened in the two weeks beforehand. </p><p>   It started with a different type of shot. In the days leading up to the Memorial Tournament, Rahm had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination -- which, unlike the ones from Pfizer and Moderna, is a one-dose regimen. He was on the verge of being in the clear. </p><p>   But on May 31, the Monday before the Memorial, the PGA Tour had notified Rahm he had come into close contact with someone who was Covid positive. That put him into protocols that required daily testing and limited his access to indoor facilities. He was still within the 14-day window for the vaccine to realize its full effect. </p><p>   The circumstances didn't affect his performance. For days he continued to test negative, and he raced out to an enormous lead. By the time he finished the third round, he was pacing the field by six strokes. </p><p>   Yet without Rahm's knowledge, as he played his third round, an unfortunate situation was brewing behind the scenes. At 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, June 5 -- while Rahm was on the course playing his third round -- a test he had taken at the conclusion of his second round came back positive. By 6:05 p.m., a confirmatory test on the sample had also come back positive. </p><p>   Rahm found out at the end of his round from the PGA Tour's medical adviser. His anguish was clear because everyone could see and hear it on television.\"Not again,\" Rahm said as he bent over in agony upon hearing the news. </p><p>   He wasn't bemoaning the test result, but rather the fact that it was the second straight year he got bad news at the Memorial. At last year's edition, he was told he committed a rules violation that would cost him a penalty stroke. </p><p>   \"It could have been handled a little bit better, yeah,\" he said this past week. \"But it still doesn't change the fact of what really happened.\" </p><p>   He won the Memorial last year anyway. He likely would have this year -- he was 18 under par there through three rounds, and the eventual winner finished just 13 under. </p><p>   But that was just one of two reasons the positive test result was crushing. It didn't just cost him a near-certain payday of nearly $1.7 million. It also destroyed his plans to reunite with his parents and newborn son. </p><p>   Rahm hadn't seen his parents in over a year, he said, because of the pandemic. They had flown in to meet his baby boy -- only he couldn't be there when his parents met their grandson because he was suddenly facing a quarantine. </p><p>   Rahm said he wasn't upset with the rules that forced him to leave the tournament. He had minimal symptoms, but his chief concern was not transmitting Covid to his son or any of the family in his house. A Spanish journalist and close family friend he knew had died from the virus, so he understood to take it seriously. </p><p>   \"Unfortunately, Covid is a reality in this world,\" he said. \"Some people might say it wasn't fair, but it was what had to be done.\" </p><p>   \"We still have to be aware of what's going on in this world,\" he added. \"Take care of yourself and everybody around you so we can get over this as quick as possible.\" </p><p>   Rahm flew home -- \"it was basically an ambulance on air,\" he said -- but remained in isolation and watched loads of television by himself. That first Sunday, June 6, he tuned into the tournament he had been about to win. Instead, he saw Patrick Cantlay outduel Collin Morikawa in a playoff. From there, he whittled away the days rewatching season four of the popular cartoon \"Rick and Morty.\" </p><p>   On Thursday, June 10, he took his first Covid test that came back negative Friday. The next day, he took another: negative. By Saturday, he was in the clear. He could finally start getting ready for the U.S. Open, beginning Thursday June 17. </p><p>   \"I believed from the biggest setbacks we can get some of the biggest breakthroughs,\" Rahm said. </p><p>   If there were one golf course Rahm could have picked to play without properly preparing for the hellacious conditions of the U.S. Open, it would have been Torrey Pines. His first PGA Tour win, back in 2017, came here. San Diego is he and his wife's favorite city. Torrey Pines is where he proposed to his wife on a hike. </p><p>   \"It was only right that I proposed in our special place,\" he said. </p><p>   On Sunday, he made it even more special on Father's Day. His family was there. And he won the U.S. Open. </p><p></p>",
