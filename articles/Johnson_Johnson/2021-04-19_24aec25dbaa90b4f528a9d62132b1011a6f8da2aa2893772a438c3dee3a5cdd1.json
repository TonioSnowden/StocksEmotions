  "title": "J&J/Alex Gorsky: pay wrongly downplays negatives",
  "text": "<p>Executive remuneration is a prickly subject at the best of times. But the pay bump given to Johnson &amp; Johnson boss Alex Gorsky was particularly contentious given the legal costs the US healthcare company has racked up over its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4eddc22-cd86-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\">alleged role</a> in America's opioid crisis. His case has not been helped by US health authorities calling for a halt to J&amp;J's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine following reports of rare but potentially dangerous blood clots.</p> <p>Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis have both recommended shareholders vote against Gorsky's pay package in a non-binding resolution this Thursday. The two companies have in the past been criticised for their cookie-cutter approach to corporate governance. In this instance they are right to take J&amp;J to task.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gorsky's remuneration totalled <a href=\"http://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/db752c88-b347-465f-8e32-7932245982b3\">$29.6m in 2020</a>. The overall pay package, which includes salary, stock options, pension and performance-based stock awards, represents a 17 per cent increase from 2019 and is nearly 50 per cent more than 2018, when Gorsky received $20.1m.</p> <p>Gorsky's base salary remained unchanged at $1.65m. Instead the bulk of the increase appears to be coming from stock awards, which increased from $10m to $13.7m this year.</p> <p>The payout comes despite $9bn in costs that J&amp;J has incurred over the past two years from lawsuits over claims that the company has fuelled <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/statement-on-opioid-resolution\">the opioid epidemic</a> and allegations of asbestos in its <a href=\"https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/e2a329b4-aeb6-438d-a449-f0e282cf8ee0\">talcum baby powder</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>J&amp;J, like many companies, excludes one-time legal fees from the metrics that it uses to calculate executive remuneration. Even so, the company managed to <a href=\"https://www.investor.jnj.com/annual-meeting-materials/2021-proxy-statement%C2%A0\">fall short</a> of its sales and adjusted earnings per share targets. Its medical devices business was hard hit as patients delayed or cancelled elective medical procedures during the pandemic.</p> <p>The only financial goal it exceeded last year was the one for free cash flow. That is mostly thanks to ultra-low interest rates. The company raised $7.5bn on the bond market in 2020, according to Refinitiv.</p> <p>J&amp;J said executive remunerations were also based on the company's “strategic performance”. Unlike financial goals however, these are largely non-quantifiable. Notably, J&amp;J developed a Covid-19 vaccine that received FDA emergency <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-third-covid-19-vaccine\">use authorisation</a>. This has helped to lift the stock 18 per cent from its October low, in spite of the rollout being paused.</p> <p>J&amp;J cannot have it both ways. Litigation costs and Covid-19 vaccines are both extraordinary one-off events. Gorsky cannot be rewarded for good things such as the vaccine and not be held accountable for the bad things that happen, such as multibillion-dollar legal charges. Investors should vote against the pay package.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline. </em></p><p>Source:  2021 'J&amp;J/Alex Gorsky: pay wrongly downplays negatives' FT.com 19 April.
