  "text": "<p>Early evidence shows a “clear” drop in the effectiveness of current Covid-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant of coronavirus, according to the head of the European drugs regulator, who says it will take time to reach a consensus on whether variant-targeted vaccines will be needed.</p> <p>Limited research findings suggest a drop in antibody counts when two shots are pitted against Omicron for mRNA vaccines, and also for adenovirus-based vaccines such as those from Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson.</p> <p>“The data coming in . . . it's not at all definitive, there are very small numbers, [but] it's clear that there is a drop in effectiveness,” Emer Cooke, executive director of the European Medicines Agency, told the Financial Times. “How much, we don't know.”</p> <p>But preliminary evidence also shows that a third dose of mRNA vaccines can at least partially restore antibody levels. On Monday, Moderna became the latest vaccine maker to put out study results saying a third dose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aebff238-3155-4131-8b3e-4be76b22a177\">improved antibody levels</a>. Scientists have said they believe full vaccination can still protect against severe disease.</p> <p>“Whether [the drop in effectiveness] can be compensated by boosting, we don't know, so for us it's too early,” Cooke said. She added that more work on effectiveness had to be done, and the agency would then assess the Omicron situation both in Europe and globally.</p> <p>Cooke also said AstraZeneca had not formally applied to have its shot used as a booster in the bloc. The company said it had submitted data to have its shot assessed as a booster, and that it continued to work closely with the EMA. </p> <p>She stressed people should continue to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions to stem contagion, and get vaccinated and boosted when offered “because that's the best protection at this point in time”.</p> <p>“This is really what we have to do as a message now, and let science take its course,” she said. “But if we stop on the vaccination and boosting, we're going to lose ourselves several months.”</p> <p>The decision on whether Omicron-targeted vaccines were needed would be made “when there is sufficient scientific evidence that the current vaccines aren't working”, she said, adding that Omicron was a “major threat” that had to be assessed by various expert groups globally.</p> <p>Any decision, she said, was not one for the EMA, but rather one for the global scientific community to be reached through consensus.</p> <p>Most vaccine makers have said they have begun work on assessing new vaccines against Omicron.</p> <p>If a determination was made that targeted vaccines were needed, Cooke said the agency would ask for data on their ability to elicit antibodies as well as on manufacturing capabilities. But it still was not clear whether the agency would ask for these studies in vaccinated or unvaccinated people and how many arms the studies would have, she said.</p> <p>She reiterated that an “array” of different vaccines was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b79b24fb-90bb-4720-98f2-d72fe21d342b\">needed to hedge against manufacturing and efficacy risks</a>.</p> <p>“We need to maintain supplies [of existing vaccines] and to seek new ones,” she said, encouraging “healthy competition” and giving the regulator the ability to explore whether some might do better in certain situations.</p> <p>“[As a regulator,] you know that people want answers ‘yesterday',” she said. “But you also want to give the right answer. And the right answer takes time.”</p><p>Source: Donato Paolo Mancini in London 2021 'Covid vaccines clearly less effective against Omicron, says EMA head' FT.com 20 December.
