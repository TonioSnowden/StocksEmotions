  "text": "<p>The consumer-goods company said it started investigating its products after news reports of other aerosol products containing benzene. In July, Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled most of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens after it found the chemical in some of its products.</p><p>\"While benzene is not an ingredient in any of our products, our review showed that unexpected levels of benzene came from the propellant that sprays the product out of the can,\" P&amp;G said.</p><p>P&amp;G last month announced a recall of Old Spice and Secret antiperspirant sprays for the same reason. That recall applies to 18 sprays, including eight varieties of Old Spice and 10 types of Secret sprays.</p><p>High levels of exposure to benzene can cause cancer, including leukemia and blood cancer of the bone marrow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Based on exposure modeling and the cancer-risk assessments published by the Environmental Protection Agency, P&amp;G said, \"daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.\"</p><p>The company, which makes products that range from Pampers diapers to Tide detergent, said it hadn't received any reports of adverse events related to the recalled products and was conducting the recall out of an abundance of caution.</p><p>P&amp;G customers who bought any of the recalled products can apply to get reimbursed, the company said. Retailers have been contacted to remove the recalled products from their inventory and shelves.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com</p><p>P&amp;G Recalls Some Pantene, Aussie, Herbal Essences Dry Shampoos</p>",
