  "title": "Johnson & Johnson to spin off consumer business",
  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is to spin off its consumer products division, best known for Band-Aids and baby shampoo, as the world's largest healthcare company seeks to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices. </p> <p>The division, which is forecast to generate $15bn in sales this year, will be split off in 18 to 24 months, most likely via a stock offering. The company plans to make the transaction tax free and keep the overall dividend at the same level. </p> <p>It is the latest in a wave of well-known global companies to announce plans to split up this week, following US industrial conglomerate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ca38b2c-a9ce-4450-b156-a17a24e33976\">General Electric</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/045c6366-3c54-4462-89b4-95246122c948\">Japan's Toshiba</a>, in an effort to slim down and focus on individual businesses. </p> <p>Shares in J&amp;J traded 1.5 per cent higher at $165.55 in New York at midday. </p> <p>Alex Gorsky, J&amp;J's chief executive, said the planned separation was a “momentous event” in the company's 135-year history and called it the best way to serve patients, consumers and healthcare professionals. </p> <p>“We do think it is a big and bold initiative, but ultimately we think this is about increasing innovation and accelerating growth,” he said.</p> <p>Gorsky said J&amp;J had to adapt to a rapidly changing healthcare landscape caused by digitisation, artificial intelligence and the shift to a more personalised care model. </p> <p>Gorsky is starting the break-up before he hands over the reins to his successor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7483426f-dd8b-4ca5-a307-5ce1a1f604fd\">Joaquin Duato</a> at the start of next year. Duato, currently vice-chair of the executive committee, has been at the company for three decades and will lead the new slimmed-down J&amp;J.</p> <p>J&amp;J is following many other large pharmaceutical companies that have shed their consumer divisions, including GSK and Pfizer, which formed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2c647a2-caf9-431d-80c6-8b1d6a7a7c13\">joint venture</a> from their consumer health units that they plan to spin off in the middle of next year. The pharmaceuticals industry is shifting towards slimmed-down companies focused on innovation, including high-priced specialist drugs. J&amp;J's pharmaceutical and medical devices divisions are forecast to generate $77bn in sales in 2021.</p> <p>Gorsky said the separation would allow J&amp;J to focus on “delivering industry-leading biopharmaceutical and medical device innovation and technology”, while the new consumer health company would be “a global leader across attractive and growing consumer health categories”. The company said it would give shareholders “a more targeted investment opportunity”.</p> <p>The company's consumer health division is part of a $270bn sector in which pharmaceutical groups compete with consumer goods makers such as Reckitt Benckiser and Nestlé.</p> <p>Companies in the sector have sought to tap into consumers' growing desire to manage and maintain their own health, especially in ageing populations and in territories where state healthcare is struggling. The J&amp;J division, which owns brands such as Tylenol painkillers and Nicorette smoking cessation aids, reported 3.1 per cent organic sales growth in 2020.</p> <p>Analysts have predicted the highly fragmented consumer health sector would ultimately consolidate. For instance, of the companies that compete in that space, only GSK and J&amp;J have more than 5 per cent market share globally. </p> <p>But the restructuring marks a significant departure for J&amp;J, which until recently had touted its decades-long diversification strategy for helping it to ride out volatile markets and deliver advantages in scale. </p> <p>Danielle Antalffy, analyst at SVB Leerink, said the spin-off made sense for J&amp;J as the consumer business has acted as a drag on growth for the wider business. The new J&amp;J, compromising the pharma and medical devices units, and a standalone consumer business would each be more nimble and dynamic, she added. </p> <p>Ashtyn Evans, analyst at Edward Jones, said the break-up plan “could help unlock value for shareholders by increasing focus on the consumer business, which has grown minimally over the last five years”.</p> <p>Moody's, the rating agency, said J&amp;J's break-up plan&#xa0;could have a negative impact on its credit rating&#xa0;due to the reduction in scale, diversity and earnings that would stem from the transaction.</p> <p>The consumer division also made talcum powder, which has been the subject of lawsuits claiming that it contained a carcinogen, which the company vehemently denies. J&amp;J recently spent $1.4bn on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/603de67b-17a4-4225-a78e-53ef87546734\">contentious legal manoeuvre</a> that created a subsidiary to manage the multibillion-dollar claims and placed it into bankruptcy. It stopped selling talcum powder in the US and Canada last year. </p> <p>J&amp;J told analysts billions of dollars of legal claims related to the company's baby talc product was not a factor in its decision. </p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler and Judith Evans in London and Jamie Smyth in New York 2021 'Johnson &amp; Johnson to spin off consumer business' FT.com 12 November.
