  "title": "U.S. News: Booster Vaccination Rates Drop Off",
  "text": "<p>The agency says about half of booster-eligible people have gotten one so far, compared with about 69% of the eligible population who have completed a regular vaccine series.</p><p>Public-health officials and researchers say they don't want people to lose a sense of urgency and leave themselves unprepared for another potential ramp-up in cases or possible new variants in the future.</p><p>\"I don't think any of us are sure we are out of the Covid era,\" said Meg Fisher, special adviser to New Jersey's health commissioner and a pediatric infectious-disease specialist. She said all types of vaccinations have slumped in the Garden State, which launched a week-long booster push on Wednesday that includes vaccine sites staying open longer.</p><p>New Jersey, like New York, also has a mass text-messaging campaign targeting booster-eligible people. Colorado sent more than a million such messages last month. Maryland recently rolled out a new campaign that includes a possible $1 million prize.</p><p>Factors contributing to the booster slowdown likely include vaccinated people putting off additional shots after breakthrough infections, concerns that side effects like fevers and tiredness could cause them to miss work, and lack of urgency as case numbers plummet, according to Dr. Fisher. \"As people become more complacent, they don't really see the need to get boosted,\" she said.</p><p>Data have shown that boosters can enhance protection against Covid-19 that would otherwise fade several months after initial vaccinations. While breakthrough infections were common during the Omicron wave, boosters helped limit infections and the severity of cases including hospitalizations, when compared with vaccinated people who weren't boosted and the unvaccinated, CDC data show. The federal agency has also found that boosted people have the lowest rates of Covid-19 deaths.</p><p>About 66% of the fully vaccinated population ages 65 and up are boosted, according to CDC data, compared with about 47% of the entire fully vaccinated adult population. Geographic patterns mirror those for other vaccine shots, from the highest rates of adoption in some New England states to some of the lowest rates among Southern states.</p><p>Authorities started recommending boosters for older and vulnerable people in September, and in November the government recommended them for all adults.</p><p>The CDC currently recommends boosters for anyone 12 years and older. People are advised to get boosters at least five months after they get their second dose of an mRNA vaccine from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, or at least two months after the single Johnson &amp; Johnson shot.</p><p>In central Florida, 62-year-old Sherry Swendsen got the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine last summer because her retail job required it. She now works from home as a travel consultant and has declined boosters. She said she doesn't have underlying health issues and isn't persuaded by evidence showing boosters can reduce the odds of severe illness.</p><p>The sharp rise in breakthrough infections during the Omicron surge likely means there are people who got Covid-19 while waiting on the sidelines before getting boosted, said Buddy Creech, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p><p>---</p><p>Jennifer Levitz and Jared S.
