  "title": "U.S. News: Moderna Tests Its Vaccine in Children --- Pediatric study looks at impact of different dose levels; Pfizer slates its new trial",
  "text": "<p>\"This pediatric study will help us assess the potential safety and immunogenicity of our Covid-19 vaccine candidate in this important younger age population,\" Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said.</p><p>The bulk of the U.S. vaccination campaign has focused on protecting adults, who are at higher risk of severe disease caused by the coronavirus. Moderna's and Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccines are authorized for use in adults 18 and older, while the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE is cleared for use in people 16 and older.</p><p>Efforts have begun to test the Covid-19 vaccines in children, who can still become infected, both to protect them from the virus and further build the population-level immunity to move past pandemic restrictions.</p><p>Federal health officials have suggested that if studies are positive, junior- and senior-high students could get access to vaccines in the fall, followed by children of elementary-school age in early 2022.</p><p>Health authorities say that if shots are proven to be safe and effective in children, vaccinating them will protect their own health as well as the health of adults.</p><p>Though the risk of severe Covid-19 is lower among children than in adults, the disease has caused hospitalizations and deaths in some young patients. Children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants might be at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"These kids can get coronavirus infection and the problem is they can spread this infection to other individuals,\" said Tina Q. Tan, an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.</p><p>Testing a vaccine in children as young as 6 months is important, Dr. Tan added, because some infants and toddlers go to daycare and could transmit the virus.</p><p>The drug companies ran large trials, mostly in adults, to test the authorized vaccines. Pediatric physicians say it is important to also test them in children before expanding use to that population because children sometimes respond differently to vaccines than adults.</p><p>Sometimes children have more robust immune responses to a vaccine than adults, which could require different dose levels, said Sean T. O'Leary, professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo.</p><p>Some of the Covid-19 vaccines, Dr. O'Leary said, can cause temporary symptoms such as headache and fatigue in adults, a sign of an immune response. \"If you have a lot of kids having even temporary acute issues, it's not going to be a very well-received vaccine,\" he said.</p><p>Both Pfizer and Moderna last year started testing their vaccines in adolescents aged 12 years and older. Both trials have fully enrolled subjects and the results are pending. J&amp;J is planning to start pediatric testing of its vaccine.</p><p>Pfizer plans to conduct a trial of its vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 years old, and will share more details when plans are completed, a company spokeswoman said.</p><p>The new Moderna study, which is a combined Phase 2 and 3 trial, will aim to enroll about 6,750 children and will be conducted in two parts, the company said. The first part will test different dose levels of the vaccine in children.</p><p>In the second part, other study subjects will be randomly assigned to receive two doses of either Moderna's vaccine or a placebo, 28 days apart. Researchers will track the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of the vaccine.</p>",
