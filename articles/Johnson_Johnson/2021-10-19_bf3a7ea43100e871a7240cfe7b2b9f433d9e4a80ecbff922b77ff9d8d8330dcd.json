  "text": "<p>The blockbuster success of Netflix fantasy series <em>Squid Game</em>, in which the characters have to navigate a series of brutal “children's games” to survive, has once again highlighted South Korea's prowess in the global entertainment industry. </p> <p>But, in reality, the country's cultural industries, typified by other hits such as K-pop superstars BTS, are facing a battle of their own — this time in their biggest growth market of China as President Xi Jinping cracks down on the country's tech, gaming and entertainment industries. </p> <p>Some of Korea's richest and most innovative companies are quietly rewriting corporate strategies to avoid the brunt of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacf9b6a-326b-4aa9-a8f6-2456921e61ec\">Beijing's regulatory offensive</a>, which has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c89594c1-1d85-4dda-9e67-55c775bd6c9a\">wiped hundreds of billions of dollars</a> from the value of China's dominant tech groups and is hurting Korean groups in the process.</p> <p>“China can no longer be where Korean companies focus,” said Choi Kwang-wook, president of J&amp;J Asset Management, an investor in South Korean entertainment and gaming groups. “Now, they need to expand beyond China to south-east Asia, the US and Europe for their future growth.”</p> <p>The popularity of South Korea's music, television, film and gaming industries, known as the “Korean wave”, or <em>hallyu</em>, has propelled the country to global renown and netted an annual $107bn in revenues worldwide, according to the state-run Korea Creative Content Agency. </p> <p>But South Korea's gaming developers have been among the worst-hit by Xi's crackdown on gaming. Described by Chinese state media as “spiritual opium”, the government has imposed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ade15372-a3f6-4b60-807a-06a4fde919dd\">three-hour</a> weekly limit on online gaming for young players. The South Korean gaming industry had counted on greater China for $3.5bn in annual exports, more than half of its total. </p> <p>Shares in leading Korean gaming group Krafton, known for the global hit title <em>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,</em> have fallen below their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/394125fd-d18c-48b3-bf6f-c08cce415e3c\">initial public offering price</a>. </p> <p>The stock of Pearl Abyss, another games developer, has fallen more than 10 per cent since the end of August. Meanwhile, Nexon, whose title <em>Dungeon Fighter</em> <em>Online</em> has been one of the most popular games in China since its release in 2005, had given up hope of approval for its mobile version, a company official said.</p> <p>Now, Krafton is accelerating plans in India, where the gaming market, the world's second-biggest after China's, more than doubled in size from $360m in 2015 to $885m in 2019, according to figures from Meritz Securities. It is also looking to reinvent itself as a broader content house, focusing on animated movies as well as games. </p> <p>“China used to be a land of opportunity for Korean game makers,”&#xa0;said one gaming executive. “But things have completely changed . . . we are now trying to focus on south-east Asia and western markets and to develop non-gaming content like dramas, film and animation.”</p> <p>Visual entertainment has already proved fertile ground for South Korean companies. Recent films <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d5476b8-4bc0-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\"><em>Parasite</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e71e8e33-3aef-490b-9704-8dfd8799ee1b\"><em>Minari</em></a> have won international critical acclaim, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2775f7dc-5cd1-4a0f-83e9-2da6765058a0\"><em>Squid Game</em></a>, a dystopian parable of inequality that has captivated audiences this year, was on track to be Netflix's most popular show ever and generated $891m for the streaming giant, Bloomberg reported.</p> <p>The prospects of South Korea's $13.7bn cosmetics industry have also dimmed as Chinese authorities ramped up a campaign against so-called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb9b60e-c78d-4b1f-9fa0-210a1a099671\">effeminate fashion</a> trends popularised by South Korean celebrities. Officials have lambasted the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3a91ec0-2ce6-4b59-bb11-779eecfd440f\">proliferation of plastic surgery</a> among young men and targeted online fan groups of K-pop acts in recent months.</p> <p>Even BTS, perhaps South Korea's most visible cultural ambassadors, have been caught up in the fray. The group was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a95f1f02-c3bd-481c-96ca-08870c82606b\">dropped</a> by South Korean companies, including Samsung and Hyundai, from Chinese marketing campaigns late last year after a singer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96cab718-05a5-4958-9084-2023d5f53f1f\">referenced the Korean war</a>. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese died in the conflict.</p> <p>It was not the first time a South Korean company had encountered nationalist headwinds in China. In 2016, retailer Lotte was forced to exit China and Hyundai's market share fell amid a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3c78afe-821d-11e7-94e2-c5b903247afd\">consumer backlash</a> over Seoul's installation of a US missile shield. </p> <p>Lee Jae-soo, at the Federation of Korean Industries, said that while the allure of South Korean music and TV dramas had previously given the country's consumer goods a cachet in China, local rivals were now offering increasingly high-quality products at lower prices. </p> <p>South Korean companies “need to focus on premium products for differentiation to move up the value chain”, Lee said.</p> <p>Cosmetics company AmorePacific is turning to its premium brand Sulwhasoo in China, after closing 276 stores of lower-end Innisfree brand since the beginning of last year. It is also pivoting to North America and Europe, where its second-quarter sales increased 56 per cent and 67 per cent respectively year on year. </p> <p>Chan Lee, managing partner at Petra Capital Management, a Seoul-based hedge fund, said that South Korean companies would be better served by accelerating plans to expand in markets other than China. </p> <p>“Those who make the strategic shift can make another leap forward while others will fall behind,” Lee said.</p> <p>When executives at K-pop agency RBW were recently recruiting for new girl pop group Purple Kiss, they made a decision that could prove emblematic of South Korean companies' sentiments: they decided against adding a Chinese member. </p> <p>“We are no longer doing business with just China and Japan in mind,”&#xa0;said Kim Jin-woo, RBW president. “Instead, we are now looking at the global market.”</p><p>Source: Song Jung-a and Edward White in Seoul  2021 'South Korean companies face own ‘Squid Game' in Xi Jinping's China' FT.com 19 October.
