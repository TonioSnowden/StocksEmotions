  "text": "<p>The blood clot concerns that led to a halt in Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid vaccine rollout risk damaging confidence in its longer-term vaccines programme, according to experts who say that rebuilding trust in its jabs will take time.</p> <p>On Wednesday, US health agencies extended their recommendation that the single-shot J&amp;J vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bf7c198-0340-4183-bbef-d14f5b04ddcd\">not be used in the US</a> for at least another week until understanding had improved of what caused extremely rare blood clots in six vaccinated women, out of 6.8m doses administered.</p> <p>The blood clot fears parallel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5cd63c6-af01-4d29-a5e5-b69ade4f3803\">worries about the Oxford/AstraZeneca</a> jab, which much of Europe has recommended only be used in older age groups. Both are adenovirus-based vaccines, whereas the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna shots use mRNA technology.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unlike AstraZeneca, however, J&amp;J has a vaccine business beyond coronavirus and is seeking to use the adenovirus method to treat other diseases. </p> <p>Last year, its Ebola jab was approved by the European Commission and the company said it manufactured 2m of the two-dose regime in under a year — less than a third of the volume of its coronavirus jabs that have been administered so far in the US.</p> <p>“They will have to build confidence that the adenovirus vector is a suitable way to deliver the foreign spike protein,” said Ross McKinney, chief scientific officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges. “That's going to be an uphill climb.”</p> <p>J&amp;J is working on late-stage trials using adenovirus-based vaccines to tackle HIV, Zika and respiratory syncytial virus, which can cause bronchitis.&#xa0;The company said it had “not seen any significant safety issues across our other vaccine programmes” using the adenovirus-based technology.</p> <p>“[The adenovirus technique] is a core technology for them. Their pipeline is dependent on it,” said Adam Barker, healthcare equity analyst at Shore Capital. In contrast: “AstraZeneca is not a vaccine player at all. Their pipeline is certainly not contingent on this technology”, he added. </p> <p>He added that if US healthcare agencies determined that the adenovirus vector causes blood clots, vaccine hesitancy will increase, “and that may become a problem down the line”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>McKinney added that it would be difficult for J&amp;J to show the adenovirus method “is as good as doing it directly with lipid droplets like Moderna and Pfizer are using in their coronavirus vaccines”.&#xa0;</p> <p>J&amp;J said in a statement: “The safety and wellbeing of the people who use our products is our number one priority, and we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event”.</p> <p>Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said: “This is going to be very hard for J&amp;J to come back from.”</p> <p>Although regulators are being extremely cautious by pausing the rollout for the whole population rather than just younger women, “people aren't going to remember the due diligence,” he added. “What they're going to remember is another bad headline.”</p> <p>The rollout pause is likely to have little effect on J&amp;J's first-quarter results, which are due to be announced on Tuesday, since the company is not selling its coronavirus jabs for profit. Analysts estimate J&amp;J's first-quarter earnings per share at $2.34, according to FactSet, compared to actual EPS of $1.86 in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p> <p>The world's biggest healthcare company has dealt with reputational issues in the past.</p> <p>Last year, J&amp;J said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88b7b5aa-a794-406a-9f7b-558cda8678e5\">stop selling</a> talcum powder in North America after a wave of lawsuits claimed that the product caused cancer. In 2019, the company became embroiled in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4eddc22-cd86-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\">opioid crisis</a> after an Oklahoma judge ordered it to pay $572m in connection with the state's epidemic.</p> <p>“J&amp;J as a corporate brand has weathered all of these PR storms really well,” said Danielle Antalffy, senior research analyst at SVB Leerink, adding that most drug development schemes typically experience some issues. </p> <p>“Usually you're not running these programmes at warp speed so you have time to iron them out,” Antalffy said.</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in London 2021 'Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid setback risks damaging its vaccine programme' FT.com 19 April.
