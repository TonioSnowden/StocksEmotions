  "title": "U.S. News: Opioid Suits Settled With Native Americans",
  "text": "<p>More than 400 tribes had sued the companies over the past four years, alleging they had fueled the opioid epidemic in Native American communities, causing tribal governments to spend millions of dollars in healthcare, social services and other costs.</p><p>\"We view the settlement as a first critical step in starting to address the opioid epidemic that has disproportionately impacted Indian country,\" said Tara Sutton, an attorney for the tribes based in Minneapolis. The deal \"brings some measure of justice to Indian country,\" she said.</p><p>All 574 federally recognized tribes will be permitted to receive money from the settlements, regardless of whether they filed lawsuits related to the opioid crisis, Ms. Sutton said. The settlement agreement was reached in federal court in Cleveland, the site of the national opioid litigation.</p><p>The deal follows a historic $26 billion settlement that the four companies reached last July with states including Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Louisiana, Delaware and Connecticut.</p><p>J&amp;J said the settlement announced Tuesday wasn't an admission of wrongdoing and the company would continue to defend itself against litigation. \"The company's actions relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription opioid medications were appropriate and responsible,\" J&amp;J said.</p><p>AmerisourceBergen said it was pleased to come to an agreement with the tribes that would \"both expedite the flow of resources to communities impacted by the crisis while enabling AmerisourceBergen to focus on ensuring the pharmaceutical supply chain is meeting the needs of healthcare providers and patients.\"</p><p>Cardinal Health declined to comment. A representative from McKesson didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>",
