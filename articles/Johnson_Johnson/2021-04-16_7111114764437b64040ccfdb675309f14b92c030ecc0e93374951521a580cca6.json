  "title": "How Colleges Are Approaching Student Covid-19 Vaccinations; Some universities are mandating the vaccine, but there are exceptions",
  "text": "<p>1. A growing number of colleges will require the vaccine, but will also allow for exemptions.</p><p>Duke University in North Carolina, Brown University in Rhode Island and Syracuse University in New York said last week that students must be vaccinated to be allowed on campus in the fall. They join a handful of other colleges that include Rutgers University in New Jersey and Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., that have recently said students must be vaccinated to attend in-person classes. Many of the roughly dozen schools that have mandated the vaccine thus far have said they would allow for medical and religious exemptions.</p><p>2. Colleges that will require the vaccine say it is the most assured way of returning to some semblance of pre-pandemic campus life.</p><p>Students at Rutgers have consistently tested positive for Covid-19 at a rate 70% higher than its faculty and staff, said Antonio Calcado, Rutgers executive vice president and chief operating officer, underscoring that despite extensive safety measures it is difficult to keep the virus at bay among a student population that wants to hang out. \"Students are built for congregation and collaboration. That's what college is all about,\" said Mr. Calcado.</p><p>3. Some schools are evaluating whether mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations conflict with federal law.</p><p>Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, said some schools are likely getting tripped up by legal language requiring the federal government to inform people they have the right to refuse a vaccine approved under an emergency-use authorization. The three vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration—manufactured by Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson —were only approved for emergency use.</p><p>For example, Texas A&amp;M University said it was following Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order, \"which stipulates that vaccines are voluntary for all state agencies. A&amp;M is encouraging all faculty, staff and students to get the vaccine,\" the school said in a statement. Cornell and Rutgers, however, said they are confident they have the legal authority to mandate the vaccines. \"We've gone through the legal analysis. We don't think there's any doubt about our ability to require vaccinations of students and we think it's the right thing to do,\" said Cornell University provost Michael Kotlikoff.</p><p>4. Forced vaccinations will bring up ethical and policy questions, as well.</p><p>Harvard's Mr. Cohen said potential ethical and policy questions that come up with mandatory vaccinations are likely to be messier than the legal ones. For instance, if a student is granted an exemption, the school will need to figure out what constitutes a \"reasonable accommodation\" and whether to offer remote learning as an option so that the unvaccinated student doesn't have to attend in-person class.</p><p>Many colleges have required certain vaccinations for years, but the standards aren't uniform, said Leila Barraza, an associate professor at the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health. Still, outbreaks on college campuses are relatively common. There were 150 mumps outbreaks in the U.S. comprising 9,200 infections in the 18 months through June 2017, according to Ms. Barraza. Half of those occurred on a college campus.</p><p>Read the original article by Yoree Koh here.</p><p>How Colleges Are Approaching Student Covid-19 Vaccinations</p>",
