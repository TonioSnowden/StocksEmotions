  "text": "<p>A booster shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine produced a strong and rapid antibody response against the virus, the pharmaceutical company said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The preliminary data from the world's largest healthcare company came as top US public health officials and rival vaccine makers said a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23cdbf8c-b5ef-4596-bb46-f510606ab556\">booster shot programme</a> was needed to protect against waning immunity. </p> <p>J&amp;J said a second shot elicited a nine-fold increase in antibodies against Covid compared with levels seen 28 days after a single dose of the jab. </p> <p>“Significant increases” in antibody responses were seen in people aged 18 to 55, as well as those older than 65, who were given a lower dose.</p> <p>Unlike the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna two-dose mRNA shots, J&amp;J's primary vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d05c7c57-da11-42a1-aa33-b66052c904ac\">requires only one jab</a>. J&amp;J previously said its single shot provided broad immunity against Covid for eight months.</p> <p>Mathai Mammen, global head of Janssen Research &amp; Development at Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company looked forward to “discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination”.</p> <p>The rollout of booster shots has been hotly debated, with the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edfa1806-562d-4097-a154-a26dfc1bc260\">urging rich countries</a> to pause programmes until at least 10 per cent of the global population has been vaccinated. </p> <p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98db2ef3-5adb-49c3-ad43-6154e0992c5d\">recommended</a> people with weakened immune systems receive a booster dose of an mRNA jab, but has held back from recommending anything for those who have received the J&amp;J vaccine. </p> <p>The agency announced a plan last week to begin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b003e7a2-6f3c-4f3d-8a95-20dd6fa976ea\">offering booster shots</a> from September 20 to all Americans who were vaccinated with the Moderna or BioNTech/Pfizer jabs, starting with those who were inoculated eight months ago. It said that a plan for J&amp;J vaccine recipients would be made when more data was available.</p> <p>Pfizer and BioNTech on Wednesday became the first companies to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a539196-22cd-4d99-8a58-6a258ec1225f#post-2a9f4065-34ef-4eaf-bc9b-daeab35d07a8\">apply</a> for full US regulatory approval for their booster shot. </p> <p>Studies showing that vaccine efficacy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b3da41e-6390-4f4b-866c-da5c6aec7f5e\">waned over time</a> have fuelled the debate around additional doses, especially as cases begin rising again in some countries. </p> <p>A CDC study on Tuesday showed that mRNA vaccine efficacy against infection from the highly transmissible Delta variant decreased from 91 per cent to 66 per cent. </p> <p>An Oxford university study published last week showed that efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against symptomatic infection almost halved after four months.</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2021 'J&amp;J says Covid booster shot produced strong antibody response' FT.com 25 August.
