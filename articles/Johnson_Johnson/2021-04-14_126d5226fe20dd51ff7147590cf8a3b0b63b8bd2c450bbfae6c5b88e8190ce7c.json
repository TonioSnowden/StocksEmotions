  "text": "<p>The European Union has unveiled plans to increase massively its supply of the BioNTech/Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, as Denmark became the first European country to end use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab.</p> <p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_1741\">said </a>50m doses of the Pfizer shot originally intended for the fourth quarter of 2021 would be delivered between April and June, raising the EU's anticipated supply of the vaccine in the second quarter to 250m doses.</p> <p>In addition, Von der Leyen said she had opened negotiations with BioNTech and Pfizer to supply a mammoth 1.8bn additional doses of the vaccine for 2022-2023, as the bloc turns long-term to mRNA-based vaccines and the companies' jab in particular.</p> <p>“We need to focus now on technologies that have proven their worth,” Von der Leyen said on Wednesday in a video statement. “MRNA vaccines are a clear case in point.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The BioNTech/Pfizer partnership — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4ca8496-a215-44b1-a7eb-f88568fc9de9\">which developed the vaccine in Germany</a> — had “delivered on its commitments and it is responsive to our needs”, she added.&#xa0;</p> <p>The announcement came after Johnson &amp; Johnson on Tuesday said it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87a9c833-dae2-4ad0-9f29-13899d671fed\">pausing the planned European rollout</a> of its vaccine because of concerns over possible links to rare blood clots, and as Denmark announced it was completely dropping the AstraZeneca shot from its vaccination programme for the same reason.</p> <p>Both the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca shots are adenovirus-based vaccines, which use an inactivated virus to deliver the vaccine protein into the body.</p> <p>The EU initially bet heavily on the AstraZeneca and J&amp;J shots, ordering hundreds of millions of doses of both. But the European bloc has since battled bitterly with AstraZeneca after it delivered only about 30m doses of the 120m it had hoped to supply by the end of March.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now the side-effect fears are marring the rollout of both shots.</p> <p>Danish health authorities said on Wednesday they would <a href=\"https://www.sst.dk/en/English/news/2021/Denmark-continues-its-vaccine-rollout-without-the-COVID-19-vaccine-from-AstraZeneca\">stop using the AstraZeneca jab</a> completely after regulators and studies found a link between the vaccine and a rare combination of side-effects including blood clots and a low level of platelets. “Based on the scientific findings, our overall assessment is there is a real risk of severe side-effects associated with using the Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca,” said Soren Brostrom, director of the Danish Health Authority.</p> <p>Other EU countries have restricted the use of the AstraZeneca shot to older people, while the European Medicines Agency regulator is investigating the same symptoms in a small number of recipients of the J&amp;J shot. Norway is set to announce its decision on whether to permanently suspend the AstraZeneca jab on Thursday.</p> <p>The 1.8bn-dose Pfizer deal — which officials say could include a substantial number of optional doses — is also part of growing EU efforts to keep vaccine production on its soil. The bloc, which is a big supplier of jabs to the world, has this year introduced and then toughened jab export controls.</p> <p>“It will entail not only the production of vaccines but also the essential components,” Von der Leyen said of the planned Pfizer agreement. “All of that will be based in the European Union.”</p> <p>While the announcement is likely to be welcomed in Europe, it will add to questions over whether the world's wealthiest countries are hoarding both vaccine supply and the most effective jabs — 1.8bn doses would be sufficient to give about five Pfizer shots to every adult in the EU.</p> <p>Pfizer has said it will be able to make more than 3bn Covid-19 vaccine doses next year and is prepared to supply Europe with “hundreds of millions of doses” from its European production in 2022 and 2023.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prashant Yadav, an expert on supply chains at the Center for Global Development, said the mRNA vaccines were so “versatile” they could be the better option as different variants of Covid-19 evolve. But he warned that such a big bet could also pose problems. </p> <p>“It does expose the EU to higher risks of manufacturing challenges, and what if other newer mRNA technologies emerge later this year which are better in terms of efficacy, deliverability — such as temperature and cold chain requirements — and the quantity of dose required?” he said.</p> <p>The EU's preference for mRNA vaccines could also make it easier for Pfizer and BioNTech to set higher prices — a point of concern for poorer member states. Last week, Boyko Borisov, the Bulgarian prime minister, said Pfizer was now asking for €19.50 per dose up from €15.50 per dose in the previous contract.</p> <p>Pfizer declined to comment on the price of the shot. The company has previously said it expects to make a larger profit margin on the vaccine as the pandemic draws to a close and the cost of goods comes down.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Additional reporting Erika Solomon in Berlin<br></em></p><p>Source: Michael Peel and Jim Brunsden in Brussels, Richard Milne in Oslo and Hannah Kuchler in London 2021 'EU bets big on BioNTech/Pfizer jab as Danes stop giving AstraZeneca' FT.com 14 April.
