  "title": "J&J One-Dose Vaccine  Found Effective by FDA  ----  By Thomas M. Burton and Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine works safely, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday, paving the way for it to authorize a third vaccine in the U.S. as early as this weekend. </p><p>   The vaccine was 66.1% effective in preventing moderate to severe disease and appeared safe, the FDA said, and the shot also showed tantalizing signs of slowing the spread of the virus. </p><p>   Health authorities are seeking to pick up the pace of vaccinations and trying to lock in gains reducing daily cases, hospitalizations and deaths while staying ahead of any new variants that threaten to evade treatment. </p><p>   Health authorities have been looking forward to adding a new Covid-19 vaccine to their arsenal. J&amp;J's shot wasn't quite as effective in its late-stage trial as the pair already in use, but it worked safely by a number of measures, the FDA said, after reviewing a 44,000-subject study. </p><p>   J&amp;J's vaccine \"met the prespecified success criteria\" for the study, the FDA said. </p><p>   Health experts said people shouldn't hold out for the other shots and should get the J&amp;J vaccine if it is authorized and offered, because it provides protection, especially against severe disease. </p><p>   Aside from effectiveness, the J&amp;J vaccine comes with advantages over the available shots that could help it accelerate and broaden mass vaccination efforts. Unlike the two vaccines in use, J&amp;J's shot requires just a single dose. </p><p>   Intriguingly, J&amp;J released new information, in an analysis that the FDA posted along with its own, suggesting the vaccine might also help reduce asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus. The vaccine reduced infections that didn't cause symptoms in study subjects, J&amp;J said. </p><p>   Public-health officials said that a vaccine that can block such infections will be critical to limit the spread of the coronavirus and ease the pandemic. One of the reasons the virus has spread so widely is because of asymptomatic transmission. </p><p>   A committee of outside medical specialists convenes Friday to evaluate analyses of the vaccine's pivotal-study results by both the FDA and the company, as the panel did for the first two Covid-19 vaccines to be cleared for use. </p><p>   The advisory committee is expected to recommend the FDA authorize the J&amp;J vaccine, and the agency is expected to make its decision soon after. FDA authorization could come as early as this weekend, a person familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The regulatory green light would bolster vaccination efforts just as health authorities pick up the pace to get people back to schools and offices ahead of new strains that threaten to evade medicines. </p><p>   Health authorities expect the initial supply of the J&amp;J vaccine will help ease, though not eliminate, the frustration felt by people unable to sign up for shots because there aren't enough doses available. </p><p>   J&amp;J has said it would deliver 20 million doses for U.S. use by the end of March, which might be enough to boost the countrywide capacity for completed vaccinations by about 20%. </p><p>   The two other Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. come from Moderna Inc. and from a partnership between Pfizer Inc. and Germany's BioNTech SE. The companies have projected delivering enough of their two-dose vaccines by the end of March to immunize 100 million people. </p><p>   Each of those vaccines requires two shots to confer their full benefit. The J&amp;J vaccine involves only one shot, a factor that also might ease the logistics of delivering doses. The shot also doesn't require ultracold temperatures, meaning that sites without expensive freezers can start vaccinations. </p><p>   The late-stage study evaluating J&amp;J's vaccine primarily measured whether the vaccine prevented cases of Covid-19 that resulted in moderate to severe symptoms. The study took place in the U.S., South Africa and other countries. </p><p>   FDA issued its analysis of the data, and the agency also posted J&amp;J's analysis. </p><p>   On the vaccine's ability to curb the spread of the virus, J&amp;J said a preliminary analysis of a subset of study subjects suggested the vaccine was 65.5% effective in preventing infections that caused no symptoms. J&amp;J cautioned, however, that more analysis is needed to confirm whether the vaccine prevents asymptomatic infections. </p><p>   Generally in the study, the vaccine proved to be effective protecting against moderate and severe Covid-19. There were seven Covid-19 deaths among study subjects getting a placebo, compared with no deaths among those who got the vaccine, the FDA said. Likewise, fewer people who got the vaccine developed critical Covid-19 cases than volunteers on placebo did. </p><p>   The vaccine's efficacy was roughly comparable across most demographic subgroups in the study. However, it was only 42.3% protective in people 60 and over who had medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, J&amp;J said. </p><p>   The FDA found there were two Covid-19 hospitalizations starting 14 days after receiving the shot in the vaccine group, versus 29 in the placebo group. There were no new hospitalizations after 28 days in people vaccinated, while in the placebo group there were 29. </p><p>   In the U.S. alone, the vaccine was 72% effective, J&amp;J said. The shot wasn't as effective in South Africa alone, where a new and more transmissible variant of the virus has emerged. </p><p>   The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines recorded higher effectiveness rates -- 95% and 94.1%, respectively -- in their late-stage trials than J&amp;J's vaccine. Those companies' trial results, however, occurred largely before new variants are known to have emerged. </p><p>   Health authorities have said that the J&amp;J vaccine was sufficiently protective -- especially against severe disease -- which, together with its single-dose regimen and favorable temperature requirements, should make a difference in the pandemic. </p><p>   The most common side effects include headache, fatigue and muscle ache. Most weren't severe. </p><p></p>",
