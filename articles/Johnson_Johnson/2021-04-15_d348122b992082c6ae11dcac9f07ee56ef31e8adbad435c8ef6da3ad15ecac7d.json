  "text": "<p>Duke University in North Carolina, Brown University in Rhode Island and Syracuse University in New York said last week that students must be vaccinated to be allowed on campus in the fall. They join a handful of other colleges that include Rutgers University in New Jersey and Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., that have recently said students must be vaccinated to matriculate for in-person classes.</p><p>Others, such as the University of California system, said their vaccination policies for fall are still in development.</p><p>Mandating the vaccine was a natural next step as accessibility opened up and supply increased, said school leaders at Rutgers, Cornell and others.</p><p>\"I think there's a lot of common sense here. The science says that the vaccine is safe, it's got a phenomenal efficacy rate,\" said Antonio Calcado, Rutgers executive vice president and chief operating officer.</p><p>Students at Rutgers have consistently tested positive for Covid-19 at a rate 70% higher than its faculty and staff, said Mr. Calcado, underscoring that despite safety measures it is difficult to keep the virus at bay among a student population that wants to hang out.</p><p>\"Students are built for congregation and collaboration. That's what college is all about,\" said Mr. Calcado. Just over 4,000 of the school's 71,000 students are currently on campus.</p><p>At Cornell, nearly all students have been back on campus since the fall but only 40% of classes are in person. If the campus can reach herd immunity, it plans to conduct almost all classes in person this fall, said university provost Michael Kotlikoff.</p><p>Many of the roughly dozen schools that have mandated the vaccine thus far have said they would allow for medical and religious exemptions.</p><p>Some schools, such as Texas A&amp;M University, have balked partly out of concern that such requirements appear to conflict with federal law.</p><p>Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, said schools are likely getting tripped up by legal language requiring the federal government to inform people they have the right to refuse a vaccine approved under an emergency-use authorization.</p><p>The three vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration -- manufactured by Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- were approved only for emergency use.</p><p>But that right to refuse the vaccine doesn't prohibit universities to make it a condition of attendance, Mr. Cohen said. He said many colleges have been requiring on-campus students to submit to tests for Covid-19; many of which have been approved under the emergency-use authorization as well.</p><p>Texas A&amp;M said it was following Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order, \"which stipulates that vaccines are voluntary for all state agencies. A&amp;M is encouraging all faculty, staff and students to get the vaccine,\" the school said.</p><p>Cornell and Rutgers said they are confident they have the legal authority to mandate the vaccines.</p><p>\"We've gone through the legal analysis. We don't think there's any doubt about our ability to require vaccinations of students and we think it's the right thing to do,\" said Mr. Kotlikoff.</p><p>Cornell said students who don't have a valid medical or religious reason for exemption won't be allowed on campus. If the school reaches herd immunity it would provide \"minimal remote accommodations\" that would mainly be for international students unable to come to campus or those who have a valid medical reason not to attend.</p>",
