  "title": "Struggling to Get Supplies --- Local pharmacies are crucial in vaccination drive but have trouble getting enough doses",
  "text": "<p>He hadn't been sure where and how to sign up for the vaccine, he said, so he put it off until an acquaintance told him about availability at Voorhies Health Pharmacy. Mr. Klimenko had walked in and put his name on the list. \"Lyova told me he will call me when they get a shipment,\" Mr. Klimenko said, using an affectionate form of the first name of Lev Fuzaylov, owner and pharmacist at Voorhies Health. A couple of days later Mr. Klimenko got the shot.</p><p>Community pharmacies like Voorhies Health play a crucial role in reaching New York City's remaining unvaccinated population.</p><p>By virtue of being local, as well as by the personal connection they have with their patients, often in their native languages, small non-chain pharmacies are able to serve those reluctant or unable to travel to mass-vaccination sites or navigate online registration, as well as those hesitant to get the shot. One in four Americans put their pharmacy as their first or second choice for where they would like to get vaccinated, according to a February survey by the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents 21,000 independent pharmacies nationwide.</p><p>Yet independent pharmacies have struggled to obtain vaccines, frequently getting them later than other providers. About half of independent pharmacists around the nation said that their vaccine supply has been inadequate, according to an April survey by the National Community Pharmacists Association.</p><p>Independent pharmacies in New York City have received just shy of 300,000 doses to date, compared with around 1.13 million at chain pharmacies, according to the city's health department. Large drugstore chains are getting supply directly from the federal government, while independent pharmacies go through third parties. The city has provided doses to about 200 independent pharmacies.</p><p>\"We have worked on capacity building, readiness for receiving vaccine and on allocation of vaccine to independent pharmacies and we're grateful for all they do to vaccinate New Yorkers,\" a spokesman for the city's health department said</p><p>Mr. Fuzaylov, of Voorhies Health Pharmacy, said obtaining vaccines has proven difficult. Glitches with the New York City Immunization Registry also prevented him from uploading required patient information for a month, he said. A technical issue that the city has been working to address has been causing such problems, according to the health department.</p><p>Administering the shot is also labor intensive and costly, Mr. Fuzaylov said. Medicare increased payments to $40 a dose for the J&amp;J vaccine in mid-March from $28. But Medicaid continued paying just $13.23 a dose, he said.</p><p>Mr. Fuzaylov was finally beginning to streamline the undertaking and planned to vaccinate more than 70 people with the J&amp;J vaccine on April 13 at an adult daycare center in Sheepshead Bay near his pharmacy. He called off the immunization clinic when he learned of the federal government's call to pause the administration of the J&amp;J vaccine because of concerns over potential side effects.</p><p>\"I didn't expect it to be that much work,\" Mr. Fuzaylov said of administering vaccines.</p><p>Philip Luk, owner of the recently established Phils Pill Pharmacy in Woodhaven, Queens, said he has been trying to provide vaccines to his customers. On Feb. 1, Mr. Luk placed his first order for the vaccine through an administrator of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. For 13 straight weeks, his orders for vaccines were canceled without a stated reason.</p><p>Mr. Luk finally got his first batch of 100 doses of the J&amp;J vaccine on April 1. By April 6 he had administered all of them and filled a seven-page wait list with names of more people seeking the vaccines.</p><p>The following week Mr. Luk ordered 300 more doses. Soon he learned that the new order was canceled. \"It's driving me crazy,\" Mr. Luk said.</p><p>Companies that help the federal government deploy vaccines to some independent pharmacies say supply is improving but still isn't meeting demand.</p><p>The Biden administration announced on March 29 a commitment to expand the number of pharmacies in the Federal Retail Pharmacy program to 40,000 from 17,000 by Monday.</p>",
