  "text": "<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a Las Vegas lawyer and six other men of violating federal securities law for their involvement in an alleged Ponzi scheme that raised around $450 million from investors.</p><p>Authorities said the alleged scheme unraveled last month when attorney Matthew Beasley confessed to running a Ponzi scheme after he was shot by federal agents who had come to his house March 3. In a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid with funds raised from later investors while the money raised is generally not invested</p><p>Mr. Beasley and Jeffrey Judd, president of J&amp;J Consulting Services Inc. and two similarly named entities involved in the alleged scheme, were identified as defendants in an SEC suit, along with five men who worked to promote the companies and attract investors in return for commissions.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Judd in civil matters said he was a victim of Mr. Beasley's misrepresentations. A lawyer for Mr. Beasley didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>J&amp;J raised funds from investors, saying the firm was providing advances to people who had settled personal-injury lawsuits. Promoters for the firm said the investments provided high returns with no risk.</p><p>The SEC said in its complaint that the purchase agreements were fictitious and that those charged allegedly used the bulk of investor money to fund lavish lifestyles including purchases of real estate, a private jet, boats and numerous luxury cars. Mr. Beasley used the cash to pay off gambling debts, according to the complaint.</p><p>In their recruiting efforts, Mr. Judd and the J&amp;J entities made materially false and misleading representations to investors, the agency alleged in its complaint. The promoters violated federal securities law by acting as unregistered brokers, the agency alleged.</p><p>Mr. Beasley acted as a lawyer for J&amp;J and drew up fake purchase agreements that were sometimes provided to investors, the SEC alleged. Investors wired much of the funds raised by J&amp;J to a bank account controlled by Mr. Beasley's law firm, which received at least $449 million from investors according to the SEC.</p><p>The SEC complaint cites recordings of a conversation a hostage negotiator from the Federal Bureau of Investigation had with Mr. Beasley after he was shot and barricaded himself in his home for several hours before being removed by an FBI SWAT team.</p><p>In the conversation, Mr. Beasley said he sent some of the cash to his bookie to pay gambling debts, according to the complaint. Mr. Beasley's alleged bookie was accused of receiving nearly $7 million in payments from Mr. Beasley's account.</p><p>Before Mr. Beasley was shot, J&amp;J had attracted the attention of Hindenburg Research, a Wall Street firm that looks for potential fraud at public companies to bet that their shares will decline.</p><p>As it tried to expose the alleged scheme, Hindenburg conducted a civilian sting operation that included chartering a private jet to help a high-school classmate of Mr. Judd pose as a potential investor. The firm shared materials it collected, including a taped conversation with Mr. Judd, with federal authorities in hopes of earning a whistleblower reward from the SEC.</p><p>Write to Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com</p><p>Lawyer Shot in March Standoff Is Sued by SEC on Alleged Ponzi Scheme</p>",
