  "title": "J&J Talc Claimants Seek to Pre-Empt Company's Bankruptcy Strategy; Separately, lawmakers probe company over whether it plans to address talc-related injury claims through bankruptcy",
  "text": "<p>Separating out talc liabilities from other assets is a first step toward the bankruptcy plan, the injury claimants said in court papers filed Wednesday.</p><p>\"We stand behind the safety of our products as decades of independent scientific testing has confirmed that our talc is safe and does not cause cancer,\" a J&amp;J spokeswoman said Wednesday. The company has previously said it hasn't decided on any course of action regarding talc lawsuits, except to defend the safety of its products and to fight pending claims.</p><p>As of April, there were roughly 28,900 pending U.S. lawsuits linking the company's talc-containing powders, which it stopped selling last year in the U.S. and Canada, to ovarian cancer and the asbestos cancer mesothelioma.</p><p>On Wednesday, a House Oversight subcommittee sent a letter to J&amp;J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky asking for documents and information on any company plans to place a subsidiary into bankruptcy over talc liabilities.</p><p>\"We seek to learn how those who have suffered harm from your product could be affected by your reported plan,\" Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D., Ill.) wrote.</p><p>J&amp;J declined to comment on the letter.</p><p>Placing a corporate affiliate in bankruptcy would give J&amp;J powerful legal tools to drive settlements, such as an automatic stay on litigation that would avoid further jury trials, according to legal experts.</p><p>The injury claimants requested the restraining order against J&amp;J in the bankruptcy proceedings of a separate company, Imerys Talc America Inc., which supplied talc to J&amp;J for decades and is named as a co-defendant in pending talc lawsuits.</p><p>Related</p><p>* How Bankruptcy Could Help Johnson &amp; Johnson Corral Vast Talc Litigation(July 20)</p><p>* Johnson &amp; Johnson Taps Jones Day to Explore Talc Bankruptcy (July 20)</p><p>* J&amp;J Opposes Former Talc Supplier's Bankruptcy Plan to Resolve Cancer Claims (Jan. 12)</p><p>Overwhelmed by the litigation, Imerys filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and has proposed a settlement with injury claimants that isn't supported by J&amp;J. Among the assets Imerys is offering to compensate cancer victims is its asserted right to indemnification, or reimbursement, from J&amp;J for the costs of defending and settling injury claims arising from talc.</p><p>J&amp;J has said it owes no indemnity because Imerys breached contractual agreements between the companies. J&amp;J also disputes that its obligations are uncapped or that they apply to talc users who will develop cancer in the future, as Imerys has alleged, according to court papers.</p><p>The injury claimants said Wednesday that a restraining order is needed to ensure that J&amp;J doesn't shed talc-related obligations to Imerys before their scope can be determined in the supplier's chapter 11 case.</p><p>At a court hearing, the judge overseeing the Imerys bankruptcy said she would consider the request Thursday.</p><p>Imerys has said in court papers that indemnification rights may be the largest single asset available to pay claimants. Bankruptcy administrators for Imerys also sued J&amp;J on Tuesday for allegedly failing to honor the indemnity.</p><p>J&amp;J said Wednesday that it \"will continue to advance our arguments objecting to Imerys' bankruptcy plan in court.\"</p><p>J&amp;J has taken some talc-injury cases to trial in recent years, and while some juries have sided with the company, others have returned huge damage awards, including a $2.1 billion judgment in Missouri that J&amp;J paid last month.</p><p>In settlement discussions, J&amp;J has said it could split income-producing assets of its Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. unit away from its talc-related legal claims before placing those liabilities in bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter have said. That would open a path for halting talc cases against the publicly traded parent company as well. Law firm Jones Day is advising J&amp;J on its options, including the possible bankruptcy, the Journal reported last week.</p><p>Splitting a corporate subsidiary's assets from its liabilities is possible under a Texas statute allowing for such \"divisive mergers.\" The strategy, which has been used by several businesses facing large numbers of asbestos claims ahead of a bankruptcy filing, can be used to silo liabilities in a newly formed unit that goes into chapter 11, according to legal experts and court documents.</p><p>Following a divisive merger and bankruptcy filing, J&amp;J's businesses could continue as usual, while a \"shell company with no business to protect gains the benefits of the automatic stay without an incentive to quickly and fairly restructure,\" the claimant committee said in papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>Koch Industries Inc.'s Georgia-Pacific LLC in 2017 used Texas law to break off an affiliate that housed asbestos-related liabilities, which then filed for bankruptcy. In 2019, Saint-Gobain Group's CertainTeed LLC similarly split off an asbestos affiliate shortly before placing it in bankruptcy. In those instances, tort litigation has been automatically stayed against both the bankrupt unit and against other, financially healthy affiliates.</p><p>\"While the details of what J&amp;J is reportedly contemplating are unknown, these prior transactions undoubtedly foreshadow the future,\" the claimant committee's filing said.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Talc Claimants Seek to Pre-Empt Company's Bankruptcy Strategy</p>",
