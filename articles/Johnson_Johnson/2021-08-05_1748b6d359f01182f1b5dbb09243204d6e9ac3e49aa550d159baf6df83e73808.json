  "title": "Rushing the Vaccine Approval Could Backfire",
  "text": "<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are not killed-virus vaccines, so faulty inactivation is not a possibility, but the manufacture is highly complex. Emergent BioSolutions, designated by the U.S. government as the sole domestic manufacturer of the Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines, had to discard 75 million vaccine doses because of possible contamination. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration recalled certain batches of a commonly prescribed diabetes drug, metformin, because it contained unacceptably high levels of a cancer-causing chemical contaminant.</p><p>Applications for approval are extraordinarily complex and sometimes contain shortcomings or inconsistencies. The medical and public-health experts who are, with the best of intentions, demanding immediate full approval of the Covid-19 vaccines, have not actually reviewed all the data documenting that the manufacturers can produce batch after batch of vaccine with the necessary purity, potency and sterility.</p><p>There is also the big-picture issue: If the FDA were to grant full approval to a product that caused a debacle similar to the Cutter incident, or even a problem like the metformin contamination, it would not only injure patients but also provide fodder for antivaccine activists and make the public skeptical of vaccines for years, or even decades. We can't afford a misstep.</p><p>Henry I. Miller, M.D.</p><p>Redwood City, Calif.</p><p>Dr. Miller was founding director of the FDA's Office of Biotechnology.</p>",
