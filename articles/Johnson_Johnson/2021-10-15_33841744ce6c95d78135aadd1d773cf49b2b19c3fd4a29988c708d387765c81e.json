  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Places Talc Injury Claims in Bankruptcy; Healthcare company places into chapter 11 a corporate affiliate holding talc-related injury liabilities, confirming fears of plaintiffs' lawyers",
  "text": "<p>While J&amp;J itself didn't file for bankruptcy, it is the latest business to use chapter 11 as a mechanism to settle large numbers of lawsuits over defective products or other alleged harms and underscores the financial risks to the company from the litigation, which as of July totaled roughly 34,600 lawsuits.</p><p>J&amp;J's defense costs have totaled nearly $1 billion in the last five years, and settlements and verdicts were another $3.5 billion, court papers show. The bankruptcy filing means J&amp;J will now get a breathing spell from further trials, plus the chance to put both current and future talc claims behind it for good through a bankruptcy settlement.</p><p>Thursday's filing also confirms the fears of personal-injury lawyers, who had voiced worries that J&amp;J would put talc claims into chapter 11 to stop jury verdicts, protect assets and pressure plaintiffs to accept settlements.</p><p>\"This stinks. They claim their product is safe and then attempt to hide behind bankruptcy,\" said Andy Birchfield, an injury lawyer pressing talc claims against J&amp;J. \"Here's another example of the wealthy and powerful using bankruptcy as a hiding place to protect their profits and avoid responsibility.\"</p><p>Chapter 11 gives corporate defendants powerful tools to drive legal settlements, such as an automatic halt on discovery proceedings and trials. Bankruptcy cases have been filed in recent years to resolve mass litigation over opioid sales by Purdue Pharma LP, sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts of America, and wildfires linked to PG&amp;E Corp.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in July that J&amp;J had hired bankruptcy lawyers to explore its options. Injury lawyers criticized the reported plans, saying in court filings it would be an abuse of chapter 11 for a healthy business like J&amp;J to evade accountability in the state-court system.</p><p>Even without filing for bankruptcy itself, J&amp;J could receive the benefit of the automatic stay on litigation, according to legal experts. The bankruptcy court could also fix J&amp;J's liability for talc claims that arise in the future as more former users are diagnosed with cancers.</p><p>J&amp;J said Thursday that it is providing financial backing for a compensation plan that would be hammered out in bankruptcy court.</p><p>\"We are taking these actions to bring certainty to all parties involved in the cosmetic talc cases,\" said Michael Ullmann, J&amp;J's executive vice president and general counsel.</p><p>J&amp;J said it would cover \"the payment of amounts the bankruptcy court determines are owed\" by the bankrupt affiliate and will establish a $2 billion trust for that purpose.</p><p>J&amp;J has taken some talc-injury cases to trial in recent years, and while some juries have sided with the company, others have returned huge damage awards, including a $2.1 billion judgment in Missouri.</p><p>The cost of defending against talc litigation for decades longer is \"unsustainable,\" according to court papers filed Thursday by LTL Management LLC, the affiliate created by J&amp;J to carry its talc claims into chapter 11.</p><p>\"The challenges of mounting an effective, uniform, and efficient defense have been staggering,\" the court filing said, blaming \"an unrelenting assault by the plaintiff trial bar\" based on \"falsehoods\" and \"disinformation\" about talc.</p><p>J&amp;J split off the talc claims from the rest of its business using a Texas law that allows for corporate liabilities to be separated from assets, through what are known as divisive mergers. Several companies have used divisive mergers in recent years to hive off asbestos liabilities into new entities that can then be placed in bankruptcy.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p><p>Related Reading</p><p>* How Bankruptcy Could Help Johnson &amp; Johnson Corral Vast Talc Litigation</p>",
