  "text": "<p>\"We'd like to see it approved as fast as humanly possible, so we can really go back to just the more normal experience,\" said Jim Malatras, chancellor of the State University of New York system, which serves 400,000 students. Under guidance from the state, he can't impose a vaccine mandate for students until the shots are granted full approval. For now the school is requiring vaccines or weekly testing, similar to the federal policy that President Biden announced on Thursday.</p><p>Three vaccines -- from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- are authorized for emergency use in the U.S. Pfizer and Moderna have filed initial paperwork for full approval. However, only Pfizer has submitted all the necessary information to the FDA, the companies said, and analysts expect it will be the first to get the green light. Moderna says it is still completing rolling data submissions, and Johnson &amp; Johnson says it plans to file for full approval this year.</p><p>Advisers to the FDA and former FDA officials familiar with the process predict that full approval of at least Pfizer's vaccine could come in September or October. President Biden said Thursday he expects the approval of the vaccines to happen in the early fall. And FDA officials have said they intend to finish the process \"far in advance\" of the regulatory deadline following applications, which Pfizer says is in January.</p><p>The FDA said it is reviewing Pfizer's application for full approval \"as rapidly as possible in keeping with the high-quality complete assessment that the public expects from the FDA.\" The agency said it is taking an \"all-hands-on-deck approach,\" including shifting personnel and technological resources to the effort and reprioritizing some other activities.</p><p>Emergency use authorization is an expedited process aimed at speeding up manufacturing and administrative processes during a public health emergency to make vaccines or drugs available to the public as quickly as possible. The FDA set special requirements for the Covid-19 vaccines, including requiring two months of clinical-trial subject data. The full approval process for biologics requires at least six months of evidence as well as plant inspections and other measures to fully vet the assembly process.</p><p>Full approval won't change how widely available the shots are but will ease restrictions on distribution and advertising for companies. Such a step will also help more states, schools and employers to introduce vaccine mandates, lawyers and current and former FDA officials said.</p><p>Once fully approved, the vaccine would be eligible for prescriptions as booster doses by prescribers, the FDA said. However, analysts said, the critical element for broad boosting is a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to the FDA, as physicians often follow ACIP recommendations.</p><p>Some public-health experts are urging the FDA to move faster to persuade unvaccinated Americans to get Covid-19 shots to confront a national surge in coronavirus infections.</p>",
