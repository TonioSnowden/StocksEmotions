  "title": "Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell? Jeffrey Epstein's Accomplice Found Guilty of Sex Trafficking; The British socialite was found guilty on five of six criminal counts in her trial",
  "text": "<p>Her lawyers argued she is a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in his jail cell in August 2019, about a month after his indictment on sex-trafficking charges. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.</p><p>Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell is a British socialite, the Oxford University-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell, a billionaire publisher and former member of the U.K. Parliament. Her father died in 1991 after falling off his yacht, which was named the \"Lady Ghislaine.\" Ms. Maxwell met Epstein in the early 1990s and was his girlfriend for several years while also consulting on his properties and helping to decorate them. They continued to be friends after the relationship ended and served as a caretaker to his real estate properties across the U.S. and in Paris.</p><p>Prosecutors describe Epstein and Ms. Maxwell as \"partners in crime.\" They allege that from at least 1994 through 2004, Ms. Maxwell recruited and abused underage girls with Epstein in locations including New York, Florida and New Mexico. They said she befriended girls by taking them shopping or to the movies and asking about their lives.</p><p>Ms. Maxwell's lawyers said she is a scapegoat who was only indicted after Epstein died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019 while awaiting charges that he trafficked and sexually abused underage girls. Ms. Maxwell has been wrongfully labeled a \"rich girl,\" her lawyers said. In reality, they said, she has worked her entire adult life. She speaks several languages and can pilot a helicopter, according to her lawyers.</p><p>What was the conclusion of her trial?</p><p>British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty on five of six criminal counts in her sex-trafficking case, capping federal prosecutors' push to bring the longtime confidante of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to justice.</p><p>After five days of deliberations, a federal jury in New York convicted Ms. Maxwell on Wednesday for what prosecutors said was her role in helping Epstein sexually abuse underage teens.</p><p>On the most serious count, sex trafficking of minors, the jury found Ms. Maxwell guilty. That count carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. A sentencing date hasn't been scheduled yet.</p><p>David Boies, a lawyer who represents some of Ms. Maxwell's and Epstein's accusers, said he hoped federal prosecutors would pursue criminal cases against other people who enabled and participated in the sex trafficking.</p><p>Mr. Boies said he never understood why Ms. Maxwell didn't seek a plea deal with prosecutors in exchange for providing information about other people's alleged roles. She could still agree to cooperate for a reduced sentence, he said.</p><p>What was Ms. Maxwell's connection to Jeffrey Epstein?</p><p>Epstein was involved in the finances for rich and powerful individuals over four decades. Among them were retail magnate Leslie Wexner, financier Leon Black, Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress Elizabeth Johnson and hedge-fund billionaire Glenn Dubin.</p><p>In a 2009 deposition, a former house manager for Epstein testified that Ms. Maxwell was his \"main girlfriend\" starting around 1992.</p><p>Epstein in 1995 renamed a company he had in Palm Beach, Fla., to Ghislaine Corp., which was dissolved in 1998, according to Florida state records. Epstein called Ms. Maxwell his best friend in a 2003 interview with Vanity Fair.</p><p>In depositions taken in 2009 and 2010 as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein, household employees said Ms. Maxwell was a central figure in Epstein's private life. Several said Ms. Maxwell hired, supervised and fired household staff, while directing the visits of dozens of \"massage therapists\"â€”typically young women.</p><p>What accusations did Ms. Maxwell face?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell, 60 years old, faced six criminal counts at trial including enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. The trial involved testimony from four accusers.</p><p>Ms. Maxwell pleaded not guilty. \"I have not committed any crime,\" Ms. Maxwell said at a court hearing. Her lawyers have said that they plan to appeal the conviction.</p><p>She still faces two perjury charges, which will be the subject of a separate trial.</p><p>Prosecutors said Epstein worked with others to create a pipeline of young girls for sexual activities. Ms. Maxwell has been accused by multiple women in affidavits and court filings of recruiting young women for Epstein and training them for sex.</p><p>While Epstein had been charged with the abuse of young girls between 2002 and 2005, the indictment against Ms. Maxwell spans 1994 and 1997.</p><p>\"This case is the prequel to the earlier case that we brought against Jeffrey Epstein,\" then-Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said at a news conference last year.</p><p>Ms. Maxwell played a \"critical role\" in finding and grooming victims, and sometimes participated in the sexual abuse, Ms. Strauss said at the time.</p><p>How is Prince Andrew involved?</p><p>An accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein filed a lawsuit against the U.K.'s Prince Andrew alleging the British royal sexually abused her multiple times when she was under 18 years old.</p><p>In her lawsuit, Virginia Giuffre accuses Prince Andrew of raping and sexually abusing her while she was a minor. The abuse created severe and lasting damage for Ms. Giuffre, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in New York and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.</p><p>Prince Andrew, the second-oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, has denied Ms. Giuffre's accusations. In a 2019 interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Prince Andrew said he couldn't recall meeting Ms. Giuffre. Days after the interview aired, he said he would step back from public duties as a member of the royal family.</p><p>\"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, said in a 2019 statement.</p><p>His lawyers are expected to argue for a dismissal of the suit at a hearing Jan. 4.</p><p>Write to Anthony DeRosa at anthony.derosa@wsj.com and Corinne Ramey at corinne.ramey@wsj.com</p><p>Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell?
