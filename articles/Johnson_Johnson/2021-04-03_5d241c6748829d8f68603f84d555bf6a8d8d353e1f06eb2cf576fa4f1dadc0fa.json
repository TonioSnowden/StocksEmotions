  "text": "<p>The drugmaker also said it plans to begin studying the vaccine in pregnant women.</p><p>\"It is vital that we develop vaccines for everyone, everywhere, to help combat the spread of the virus with the goal to return to everyday life,\" said J&amp;J Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels.</p><p>J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine and another from Moderna Inc. are authorized for use in adults 18 years and older in the U.S. and certain other countries. A third vaccine, from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, is authorized for people 16 years and older.</p><p>The U.S. mass-vaccination campaign's initial focus has been to inoculate adults because the risk of severe Covid-19 illness increases with age, and the large studies establishing the vaccines' safety and efficacy were conducted mostly in adults. But infectious-disease specialists say that if the shots safely work in children, it will be important to vaccinate them as well, not only for individual protection but also to build up communitywide defenses.</p><p>Pfizer said this week that its vaccine safely protected children ages 12 to 15 from Covid-19, which could lead to vaccinations of that age group by summer if health authorities authorize it. Pfizer also has begun a study in children under 12 years old. Moderna is testing its vaccine in children age six months to 17 years.</p>",
