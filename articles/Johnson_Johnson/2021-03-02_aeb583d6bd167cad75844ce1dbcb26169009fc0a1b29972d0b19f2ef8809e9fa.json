  "title": "U.S. News: New J&J Vaccine Joins Battle Against Covid",
  "text": "<p>A FedEx Corp. spokeswoman said pickups had begun at a McKesson facility in Olive Branch, Miss. The shipping company is using its distribution hub in Memphis, Tenn., to deliver the doses nationwide.</p><p>UPS trucks picked up J&amp;J vaccine from a McKesson facility in Shepherdsville, Ky., on Monday and brought them to a UPS center in Louisville, Ky., a United Parcel Service Inc. spokesman said. The doses will then be flown to UPS sites throughout the country for delivery by vehicle Tuesday morning.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday authorized use of the J&amp;J vaccine. The drug company had made nearly four million doses for initial shipment. The administration said it expected about 20 million doses to be delivered by the end of March.</p><p>Distribution will be uneven early on as the company increases production, it said, meaning the bulk of the additional 16 million doses will arrive later in the month.</p><p>\"We're getting these doses out the door as soon as they're available to ensure vaccines get into arms as quickly as possible,\" a senior Biden administration official said Sunday.</p><p>J&amp;J has said it expects output will quickly increase, enabling it to deliver a total of 100 million doses for use in the U.S. by the end of June. The company said it had begun shipping the vaccine, which is being allocated and distributed under federal supervision.</p><p>Health authorities have been counting on vaccinations to protect people against Covid-19 and permit schools, businesses and other establishments to fully reopen. The pace of vaccinations has increased following a shaky start, but limited supplies have restricted how many people are designated eligible.</p><p>More than 75 million doses have been administered in the U.S. out of 96.4 million doses distributed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The first two Covid-19 vaccines cleared for use require two doses for full protection, according to the FDA. J&amp;J's vaccine needs just one dose, which should simplify the vaccination drive, though the shot wasn't as effective in late-stage trials as the other two shots.</p><p>J&amp;J's shot was still plenty effective, health experts say, and its performance in the trial may have been affected by the presence of coronavirus variants that may not have been present during late-stage trials for the other two shots.</p><p>Public-health advisers to President Biden have urged Americans to take the first available vaccine when it is their turn, and not wait for the one they prefer.</p><p>As of Sunday, 15% of the nation's population had received one or more doses of the two previously approved Covid-19 vaccines, according to the CDC. Health experts say well more than half the population needs to be vaccinated for the herd immunity needed to move past the pandemic.</p>",
