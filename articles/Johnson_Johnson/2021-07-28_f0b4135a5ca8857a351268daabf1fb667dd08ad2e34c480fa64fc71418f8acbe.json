  "text": "<p>Pfizer has raised its full-year revenue projections for its coronavirus vaccine by almost a third after the shot helped the drugmaker to almost double its sales in the second quarter. </p> <p>The US group, which markets a widely used Covid-19 vaccine along with Germany's BioNTech, upgraded its 2021 revenue forecast for the shot to $33.5bn from the $26bn it had predicted in the previous quarter. </p> <p>The group, which shares profits on sales of the Covid shot evenly with BioNTech, generated direct sales of $7.8bn from the vaccine in the second quarter. </p> <p>Albert Bourla, Pfizer chief executive, said the second quarter was “remarkable in a number of ways”.</p> <p>Pfizer and Moderna, which make mRNA vaccines, are dominating the market for new vaccine orders, while rivals AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which use a different type of technology, have been hampered by concerns over side effects and supply problems. </p> <p>The EU has placed forward orders for up to 2.1bn extra doses of the two mRNA shots. The US last week bought a further <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a015d3c0-6701-457d-aec1-328f13893ea5\">200m doses</a> of the Pfizer shot. Still, global health authorities have advised that governments should keep a wide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b79b24fb-90bb-4720-98f2-d72fe21d342b\">array of different vaccines</a> in their portfolio to beat Covid.</p> <p>More than 1bn doses of the Pfizer shot have been delivered globally. Pfizer said it expected to deliver 2.1bn doses in 2021 under contracts signed as of mid-July. Some nations have begun placing orders for booster shots, though scientists and regulators are still divided on whether they will be needed.</p> <p>Pfizer estimates the income-before-tax margin on sales of the vaccine to be “in the high 20 per cent range”. On a call with analysts, executives reiterated they expected a booster dose to be required eight to twelve months after vaccination, though with Delta that may have to happen “a bit earlier”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pfizer's second-quarter sales rose 92 per cent to $18.98bn, while earnings per share climbed 58 per cent to 98 cents, the group said on Wednesday. </p> <p>The company said sales from its overall business, excluding the impact of the vaccine, rose 10 per cent. The drugmaker raised its full-year sales guidance to a range of $78bn to $80bn, up from $72.5bn expected in the previous quarter.</p> <p>The company's New York-listed shares were up by just over 3 per cent in early-afternoon trading. </p><p>Source: Donato Paolo Mancini 2021 'Pfizer raises sales forecast for Covid vaccine by almost a third to $33bn' FT.com 28 July.
