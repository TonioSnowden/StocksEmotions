  "title": "Germany Hits Record Covid-19 Tally as Pandemic Rebounds Across Europe; Country's recent success in fending off the virus left many people without natural immunity, a possible factor behind the current surge",
  "text": "<p>Even so, Germany and some of its smaller Central and Eastern European neighbors stand out, having recorded a much steeper surge in infections than neighboring France, Italy and Spain. Germany registered over 37,000 new cases on Friday, the highest daily case number on record, according to government figures, as the seven-day incidence of coronavirus rose to over 200 in 100,000 people.</p><p>Experts blame Germany's figures on the German population's relatively low exposure to the virus after the country dodged the summer spike in infections that afflicted its Western and Southern neighbors. That resulted in low natural immunity among the population.</p><p>Other factors playing a role include a comparatively low rate of vaccination, the slow rollout of booster shots to high-risk groups as well as lower temperatures that are dragging people indoors.</p><p>\"The figures are frightening,\" said Prof. Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's center for disease control, told reporters last week, saying that prevention measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing were no longer being sufficiently adhered to.</p><p>Over 67% of the German population have been fully vaccinated, and experts say this is helping to keep hospitalizations and deaths below their level during previous case surges. The seven-day rolling average of deaths linked to Covid-19 rose to 118 on Sunday, much less than the record 894 in January but significantly more than the average in recent months.</p><p>Germany, the European Union's most populous country with 83.2 million inhabitants, had more than 2,500 Covid-19 patients in intensive care on Sunday, against over 5,000 in late April, at the peak of the previous wave of infections.</p><p>Yet Germany is struggling to raise the number of vaccinated further, with vaccinations plateauing recently. Unlike some other European countries, German authorities don't mandate vaccinations for workers because of concern that such mandates could be overturned in court or cause a popular backlash.</p><p>Health Minister Jens Spahn said last week that around 50% of care personnel—including those tending to the elderly and other risk groups—were unvaccinated, but that he was reluctant to make vaccinations mandatory for them for fear that they could stop coming to work.</p><p>Over 16 million of people older than 12 haven't been vaccinated, including 3.2 million of those older than 60. And following a drop in cases during the summer, some restrictions were rolled back across the country as kindergartens, schools and universities reopened and workers returned to their offices.</p><p>National and state authorities are now debating reintroducing fresh safety measures. Some states already have rules requiring proof of vaccination, recovery from Covid-19, or a recent negative test to access restaurants, gyms and other indoor venues, but controls are becoming laxer. By contrast, Italy introduced mandatory vaccination or tests for all employees in October, with offenders facing fines.</p><p>Germany's relative success in fending off the virus earlier in the pandemic may have contributed to its current weakness, according to Prof. Hendrik Streeck of Bonn University in Germany.</p><p>While Prof. Streeck cautioned against comparing countries directly, he said residents of Britain, France and Italy had suffered more infections earlier in the pandemic and might now enjoy higher population-wide immunity as a result.</p><p>Germany has recorded 96,492 deaths to date, compared with 142,019 in Britain, 132,334 in Italy and 118,830 in France, which all have smaller populations, according to the Our World in Data website of the University of Oxford.</p><p>Most if not all people who are neither vaccinated nor had the virus will likely become infected in the next months, according Dr. Andreas Gassen, head of the country's National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians.</p><p>The weakening of the protection afforded by vaccines also plays a role in rising infection figures, experts said. Around 26% of intensive care patients infected with Covid-19 have been fully vaccinated, while that figure goes over 34% for patients older than 60, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The Institute said that the so-called breakthrough infections were by far most common in those vaccinated with Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-dose shot.</p><p>Around 40% of people older than 60 had no neutralizing antibodies against the Delta variant of coronavirus six months after becoming fully vaccinated, according to Prof. Leif Erik Sander, a vaccine expert at the Charité University Clinic in Berlin.</p><p>Some 30 million people in Germany who belong to the high-risk group, including the elderly and people with serious underlying conditions, would need a third shot, Prof. Sander said.</p><p>Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the University of Hamburg, said the current surge was unsurprising, yet authorities were still lagging behind those in neighboring countries in offering booster shots to the most vulnerable. Infections among vaccinated people who aren't forced to get tested under existing rules were contributing to the current transmission, he said.</p><p>\"Many citizens may not have understood that the vaccine is primarily for protecting from severe disease and death, not for preventing infection,\" he said.</p><p>Britain, which has a similar vaccination rate as Germany but has dropped all pandemic measures, experienced a surge in infections in recent months but only a moderate increase in deaths.</p><p>Unlike Germany, however, Britain has a policy of targeted and systematic testing and its authorities have much better data to monitor the pandemic, Prof. Streeck said. Germany, for instance, doesn't collect data on whether people who tested positive to Covid-19 have been hospitalized because of the virus, or for other reasons.</p><p>The seasonal spikes in cases will become normal as Germany learns to live with the virus, especially until the majority of the population becomes immunized either by vaccination or by infection, Prof. Streeck argued.</p><p>\"The waves will get smaller and smaller but we will have seasonal surges with the autumnal onset of cooler weather,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com</p><p>Germany Hits Record Covid-19 Tally as Pandemic Rebounds Across Europe</p>",
