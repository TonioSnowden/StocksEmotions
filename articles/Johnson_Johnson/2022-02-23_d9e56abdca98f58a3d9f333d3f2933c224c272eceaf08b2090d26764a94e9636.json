  "title": "Sanofi, Glaxo Seek Covid-19 Vaccine Approval in Crowded Market; Companies say shot's straightforward storage requirements could ease rollout in poorer countries",
  "text": "<p>Sanofi and Glaxo said Wednesday that their shot was 100% effective at preventing severe disease and 75% effective against moderate-to-severe illness. The shot was 57.9% effective at preventing any symptomatic disease, a result the companies said was in line with expected vaccine effectiveness in the current environment, where variants have blunted the protection afforded by shots. In a separate trial, the shot was shown to increase antibody levels by 18 to 30 times when given as a booster following a primary series of the already-authorized mRNA and adenovirus vaccines.</p><p>The companies, which are two of the world's biggest vaccine makers, said they were in discussions with various regulators, including the FDA and European Medicines Agency, about submitting the data to support an authorization.</p><p>Sanofi and Glaxo started work on their shot around the same time as front-runners such as Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford, which have since dominated vaccine rollouts globally. Sanofi and Glaxo initially aimed to win regulatory authorizations in the first half of 2021, but fell behind when volunteers were accidentally given lower doses than intended in an early clinical trial.</p><p>That delay created greater challenges down the road. The companies ran their large Phase 3 trial after many countries started vaccine rollouts, making it more difficult to find volunteers who had been neither vaccinated nor previously infected. They were also testing their shot—based on the original strain identified in Wuhan, China—against variants like Delta and Omicron, which have blunted vaccines' effectiveness.</p><p>\"No other global Phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorized vaccines,\" said Thomas Triomphe, who leads Sanofi's vaccines unit.</p><p>The vaccine combines a synthetic version of the virus's spike protein, manufactured by Sanofi, with Glaxo's adjuvant, a substance used in some vaccines to enhance the immune response. The approach, similar to that used by Novavax, is widely used against other diseases, including in some routine childhood immunizations such as hepatitis B.</p><p>In the early months of the pandemic, health officials in the U.S. and Europe had hoped the Sanofi-Glaxo vaccine would play a key role in their immunization efforts. The companies in 2020 received $2.1 billion from Operation Warp Speed, the U.S.'s Covid-19 vaccine program, to accelerate the shot's development and distribution. The EU and U.K. also struck early deals with the companies to aid development and secure doses.</p><p>Now, if approved, the Sanofi-Glaxo shot will join a crowded market where global vaccine supply is no longer a constraint. For low- and lower-middle income countries, the bottleneck is more the logistical challenges involved in getting shots into arms.</p><p>Even so, the Sanofi-Glaxo shot will be a welcome addition to the arsenal in those countries, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. He said that it, and similar vaccines, like the Novavax one, could \"potentially become the workhorse for vaccination in the future\" because of their less-demanding storage requirements and their lower cost. \"These are very important vaccines.\"</p><p>Unlike the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which need ultracold storage, the Sanofi-Glaxo shot can be stored at refrigerator temperature. The Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson shots have similar storage requirements to the Sanofi-Glaxo vaccine.</p><p>Another potential niche is for people who have been hesitant to embrace newer vaccine technologies. While research into both mRNA and adenovirus vaccines stretches back decades, the Covid-19 shots represent their first widespread use.</p><p>Still, with the Sanofi-Glaxo shot most likely to be sold at low cost to poorer countries, it isn't expected to be a big moneymaker for the companies, according to Jefferies analyst Peter Welford.</p><p>Dwindling demand led Sanofi to halt a separate Covid-19 vaccine. The French company late last year shelved an early-stage experimental mRNA vaccine. At the time, Mr. Triomphe said it still made sense to pursue the Sanofi-Glaxo shot because it was much further along in development. CureVac NV also halted development of a mRNA Covid-19 shot to focus on next-generation products intended to have some type of advantage over available vaccines.</p><p>Roger Connor, who leads Glaxo's vaccine unit, said there was a need for a variety of vaccines on the market.</p><p>\"We are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com</p><p>Sanofi, Glaxo Seek Covid-19 Vaccine Approval in Crowded Market</p>",
