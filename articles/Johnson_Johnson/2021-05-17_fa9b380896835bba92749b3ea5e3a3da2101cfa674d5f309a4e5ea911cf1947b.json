The Tyson unit includes the Nudges, Top Chews and True Chews brands. </p><p>\n  \"Pet food is a high-growth category,\" said Bethany Quam, General Mills's group president for the pet segment. The pet segment is General Mills's fastest-growing division, with sales rising 13% to $1.29 billion through the first nine months of the company's current fiscal year. </p><p>\n  General Mills said it plans to fund the acquisition with cash on hand and short-term borrowing. It expects the deal to modestly add to its earnings in the first year after completion, excluding transaction and integration expenses. </p><p>\n  Tyson said it will continue providing meat ingredients for the pet-treats business after the deal closes. The pet-treats business generated more than $240 million for the year ended April 3, Tyson said. </p><p>\n  -- Dave Sebastian </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  WYNN LAS VEGAS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Mask Mandate Is </p><p>\n  Updated for Some </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Wynn Las Vegas said it will no longer require fully vaccinated guests and employees to wear a mask following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's updated guidance. </p><p>\n  The CDC said fully vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask or physically distance during outdoor or indoor activities, large or small, the broadest easing of pandemic recommendations so far. </p><p>\n  Wynn said 91% of its employees in Las Vegas have been vaccinated. </p><p>\n  The company said it has obtained permission to run gaming areas at Wynn and Encore at 100% occupancy, with plexiglass dividers removed from all table games and slot machines. </p><p>\n  -- Dave Sebastian </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  HONDA MOTOR </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  North America </p><p>\n  Rebound Fuels Profit </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Honda Motor Co. swung to a profit in its most recent quarter as the auto maker's business continued to recover from the pandemic, especially in North America. </p><p>\n  The Japanese auto maker said earnings for its fourth quarter ended March 31 rose to 213.32 billion yen ($1.95 billion), compared with a loss of 29.54 billion yen a year earlier, when the pandemic hit Honda's bottom line and car sales slumped. </p><p>\n  Fourth-quarter revenue increased 4.8% to 3.624 trillion yen.
