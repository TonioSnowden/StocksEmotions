  "title": "U.S. Calls For Pause In J&J's Vaccine Over Clots --- Agencies seek data on severe side effects for six women who got the one-dose Covid-19 shot",
  "text": "<p>The action prompted the U.S. government to suspend the administration of J&amp;J's vaccine at federal sites, a U.S. health official said, while some states and other authorities followed the recommendation and moved to administer other authorized shots. Other countries, meanwhile, also moved quickly to limit the shot's use.</p><p>The severe side effects were rare -- more than 6.8 million doses of J&amp;J's shot have been administered in the U.S. -- but health authorities said they moved quickly out of an abundance of caution.</p><p>\"The fact that a pause was done, I think, is just a testament to how seriously we take safety,\" said Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease official.</p><p>The U.S. government's review might take only a few days, health authorities said. A panel of outside experts is slated to meet Wednesday to review the matter for the CDC, while Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock indicated the agency will quickly conduct its review.</p><p>At the same time, the halt comes at a dangerous time during the more than year-old pandemic, as health authorities race to vaccinate as many people as possible before variants develop that can evade the shots.</p><p>Among the biggest hurdles is overcoming hesitancy to get vaccinated, and the specter of blood clots could add to concerns about the safety of the shots. A pause in the use of the J&amp;J vaccine could also be felt especially in areas that lacked the special freezers required to store the two-dose shots from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc. Places like college campuses that have potentially transient populations have preferred the single-dose J&amp;J vaccine.</p><p>Yet the impact could be limited, especially if J&amp;J vaccinations are allowed to resume. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have proved relatively safe so far, and those companies have been ramping up production as they gained more experience making the shots and expanded their manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>J&amp;J's vaccine wasn't a big source of doses yet. Federal officials expected to allocate about 26.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines combined this week, compared with 1.5 million of J&amp;J's.</p><p>Combined, the companies have delivered 245.4 million doses, and 192.3 million of these have been administered, according to the CDC.</p><p>President Biden played down the significance of the pause, saying the 600 million doses his administration had helped secure of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines would be sufficient to cover the eligible adult population.</p><p>\"There is enough vaccine -- that is basically 100% unquestionable -- for every single, solitary American,\" Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. Biden's Covid-19 coordinator, Jeff Zients, said the administration was working with state and federal partners to get people who were scheduled to receive the J&amp;J shot signed up for a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.</p><p>Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said the company upped production of its Covid-19 vaccine and will be able to deliver 10% more doses to the U.S. by the end of May than previously agreed. In addition, Mr. Bourla said on Twitter, Pfizer will supply the full 300 million doses agreed on for the end of July two weeks early.</p><p>J&amp;J said it knows that a small number of people who got its vaccine developed blood clots and had low levels of blood platelets. J&amp;J said it is working with health authorities and medical experts.</p><p>The company also said it had decided to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe.</p><p>J&amp;J has paused vaccinations in all ongoing clinical trials of its vaccine while it updates guidance for research investigators and study subjects. J&amp;J had been conducting a trial testing two doses of its vaccine in adults, as well as a study in adolescents ages 12 to 17.</p><p>Clots can be life-threatening, even fatal, if they choke off blood and therefore oxygen flow to the brain or heart. The type of blood clot seen in some people receiving the J&amp;J vaccine was called a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which can prevent blood from draining out of the brain and can lead to a hemorrhage.</p><p>European health authorities have also seen dangerous clots emerge in a relatively small number of people taking a Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford. That vaccine has been available in the U.K. and in Europe but isn't authorized for use in the U.S.</p><p>This month, U.K. health authorities recommended against giving AstraZeneca's shot to people under age 30 after receiving reports of rare but deadly blood clots. Countries including Canada and Germany have also restricted use.</p><p>A link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the clotting incidents is unclear. Scientists in Germany and Norway said the vaccine might cause an autoimmune reaction that leads to clots in the brain.</p><p>It is possible the clotting is related to the gene- and viral-based technology behind the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca shots.</p><p>Both viral-vector vaccines contain a virus that causes the common cold but which has been rendered harmless. That virus is engineered to include genetic instructions that set off an immune response to protect people against the coronavirus.</p><p>The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a different technology, called messenger RNA, to achieve the same goal.</p><p>J&amp;J's vaccine was the third authorized for use in the U.S., after it was shown to be 66% effective in preventing Covid-19 disease in a large study.</p><p>Some states and vaccine providers quickly made alternative plans in response to the call for a pause by federal health officials. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted that state-run mass vaccination clinics would offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in lieu of the J&amp;J shot to people with appointments Tuesday. Likewise, city-run sites in Los Angeles shifted 3,000 vaccinations scheduled for Tuesday to Pfizer's shot from J&amp;J's, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.</p><p>---</p><p>Daniel Michaels, Sabrina Siddiqui and Daniela Hernandez contributed to this article.</p>",
