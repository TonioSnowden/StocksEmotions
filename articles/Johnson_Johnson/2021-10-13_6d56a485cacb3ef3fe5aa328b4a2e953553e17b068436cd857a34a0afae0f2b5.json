  "title": "Judge Tosses Votes Backing J&J Talc-Supplier's Bankruptcy Plan; A judge set aside more than 15,700 votes backing the personal-injury compensation plan of defunct supplier Imerys Talc America",
  "text": "<p>The judge's decision affects a critical vote on the Imerys plan, which is designed to resolve its liability for thousands of lawsuits linking the talc it supplied for J&amp;J baby powder products to ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other ailments.</p><p>Voting totals calculated months ago showed that without yes votes from Mr. Bevan's clients, the bankruptcy plan would fall short of the three-quarters support from injury claimants needed to resolve current and future talc liabilities, according to the judge's ruling.</p><p>J&amp;J, which also faces vast talc litigation, has been opposing the Imerys plan and had sought to disqualify votes submitted by Mr. Bevan's firm and other plaintiffs' lawyers who gave their support under what J&amp;J alleged were suspicious circumstances.</p><p>Wednesday's ruling stated that Mr. Bevan did nothing to establish that his clients were ever exposed to allegedly dangerous talc products from Imerys that would give them an interest in the chapter 11 plan.</p><p>An Imerys representative said on Wednesday it was reviewing the ruling. A lawyer for Mr. Bevan had no immediate comment.</p><p>In issuing her ruling, Judge Silverstein said that most of Mr. Bevan's clients haven't been diagnosed with ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, the only illnesses eligible for compensation under the Imerys plan.</p><p>\"Approximately 400 of Bevan &amp; Associates clients suffer from mesothelioma, with the remainder suffering from some other form of cancer,\" the judge wrote. \"None of its clients have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\"</p><p>The judge also said that, before voting, Mr. Bevan's firm did \"zero diligence\" on which, if any, clients had been exposed to talc, much less Imerys talc.</p><p>Judge Silverstein was also critical of Mr. Bevan's use of a master ballot to vote on behalf of clients en masse, one of at least 85 submitted by plaintiffs' firms in the Imerys case. Master ballots have become more common in bankruptcy cases driven by mass-tort liabilities, the judge said.</p><p>\"In order for master ballots to work, great trust is placed in the plaintiffs' bar,\" she said. \"With respect to Bevan &amp; Associates, the evidence shows that such trust was not well-placed.\"</p><p>Mr. Bevan and two other plaintiffs' firms had switched votes to back the Imerys plan, after first rejecting it. J&amp;J and an objecting plaintiffs' firm argued that his votes—which are decisive in securing claimant support for the Imerys plan—should be disregarded.</p><p>Imerys has said Mr. Bevan and other law firms \"independently decided that it was in the best interests of their clients to change their votes,\" and that to disregard the ballots would usurp claimants' rights to vote as they see fit.</p><p>J&amp;J is facing roughly 34,600 personal-injury lawsuits over talc as of July. The company has said the Imerys plan would fix claim values for cancer victims without opposition, setting a precedent for collecting the rest of what it has called an inflated claim value from J&amp;J.</p><p>Injury claimants supporting the Imerys plan have been counting on J&amp;J to fund much of the damages based on its alleged obligation to reimburse its supplier for injury liabilities stemming from talc. J&amp;J has denied it owes any such reimbursement to Imerys or its creditors under the supply contracts between the two companies.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Bevan testified that he originally rejected the proposed plan on behalf of clients because he was concerned that votes in its favor could hurt recoveries in another talc-related bankruptcy. He testified that no quid pro quo was involved in his changing the votes, and that he did so after his concerns about the bankruptcy plan were addressed.</p><p>The judge's ruling also said the evidence was clear that Bevan &amp; Associates wasn't offered anything to change its clients' votes.</p><p>By the time Imerys filed for bankruptcy in 2019, it was swamped by roughly 13,800 claims tied to ovarian cancer and 850 related to mesothelioma.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
