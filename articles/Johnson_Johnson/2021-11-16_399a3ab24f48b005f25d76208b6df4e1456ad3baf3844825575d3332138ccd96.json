  "text": "<p>\"We want you to get the booster because the data indicates that the effectiveness of the vaccine deteriorates over time,\" said Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican.</p><p>On Monday, Arkansas, West Virginia and New York City issued their recommendations for all adults who are at least six months out from their second doses, following similar moves by California, Colorado and New Mexico last week.</p><p>When the Delta variant drove up Covid-19 hospitalizations in many states over the summer, the Biden administration began moving to encourage boosters, starting with people with weakened immune systems and then broadening eligibility to high-risk people.</p><p>The summer surges have ended in many of the states. Yet health authorities, eyeing an uptick in cases in recent days in some places, said expanded booster use could help better protect people as they head indoors for winter and gather together over the holidays.</p><p>Congregating indoors could raise the risk of Covid-19 transmission if people are exposed to someone infected for an extended period and the place isn't well ventilated, according to health experts.</p><p>\"Boosters can provide one more layer of reassurance, allowing us to breathe a bit easier, either for ourselves or our loved ones,\" New York City Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi said, announcing the decision.</p><p>A study, published in the journal Science this month, reported that the effectiveness against infection of all three vaccines among 780,225 veterans declined from 87.9% in February to 48.1% in October. The study included data from adults of all ages but skewed older, with nearly half over 65 years, and about one-third between 50 and 64.</p><p>Some health experts, however, have said available data doesn't support giving boosters beyond those at high risk, as the available vaccines provide strong protection from hospitalization or death for most people.</p><p>Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine-advisory panel and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that broad boosting won't prevent a winter surge in cases.</p><p>\"If we really want to get on top of this pandemic, it's not a matter of boosting the vaccinated, it's a matter of vaccinating the unvaccinated,\" he said.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration, which says when a drug or vaccine can be used outside clinical testing, authorized the extra doses for the elderly and others at high risk after some research indicated Covid-19 vaccines lose some of their effectiveness over time.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offers guidance to doctors as part of its mission to protect public health, then endorsed use of the shots among the select groups. Many doctors, communities and states follow the agency's direction, though they aren't bound to.</p><p>A majority of adults are eligible under the federal government's moves, according to health experts.</p><p>The Biden administration is reviewing data on booster doses to make them available to all adults in the coming weeks, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this month, Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE asked the FDA to authorize an extra dose for all people 18 years and older.</p><p>Among the developments driving their push, the people said, are rising case numbers and hospitalizations in Europe as well as in U.S. states like Vermont where vaccination rates are high.</p><p>Under the FDA's authorizations, any adult who is at least two months out from a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine is eligible for a booster.</p><p>The elderly and other high-risk people who received either the Moderna vaccine or the Pfizer-BioNTech shot are also eligible for booster doses six months after their second shot.</p><p>At least one hospital in New Jersey is mandating boosters for J&amp;J vaccine recipients. University Hospital in Newark is requiring that staff members who were vaccinated with the single dose shot receive a booster by Dec. 24, according to a statement from the hospital.</p><p>Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Boosters Become Available to All Adults Across Several States, Cities</p>",
