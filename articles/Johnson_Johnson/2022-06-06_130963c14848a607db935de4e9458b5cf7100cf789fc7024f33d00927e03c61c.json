  "text": "<p>J&amp;J provided a formal notice of termination and breach to Emergent on Monday, J&amp;J said.</p><p>The contract disclosure Monday came after Emergent BioSolutions said in a securities filing that it had sent a notice of material breach of the agreement to J&amp;J.</p><p>Emergent, of Gaithersburg, Md., said J&amp;J failed to provide requisite forecasts of the required quantity of vaccines to be purchased, and that J&amp;J doesn't plan to purchase the minimum quantity of product detailed in the initial 2020 agreement.</p><p>Emergent also said J&amp;J intends to wind down the contract without fulfilling its minimum requirements.</p><p>J&amp;J has 30 days to comply with the contract before Emergent has the right to terminate the agreement, Emergent said. The contract manufacturer said J&amp;J would owe between $125 million and $420 million if the contract were now terminated.</p><p>In response, J&amp;J said Emergent's securities filing \"is false and misleading both with respect to the contrived breach allegation against Johnson &amp; Johnson and in its failure to disclose our prior notice that Johnson &amp; Johnson would terminate the supply agreement.\"</p><p>An Emergent spokesman said the company disagrees with J&amp;J's characterization of events.</p><p>J&amp;J, of New Brunswick, N.J., sells one of three Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S., though health authorities recently limited the use of J&amp;J's vaccine because of concerns about the risk of a rare but serious blood-clotting condition.</p><p>The company said it has sufficient capacity from other manufacturing plants, and the company continues to meet its contractual obligations to supply the vaccine.</p><p>Emergent was to help J&amp;J meet demand for the vaccine. Emergent said it had agreed under its contract with J&amp;J to provide Covid-19 vaccine development and manufacturing services for up to five years. It said the contract was valued at about $480 million in the first two contract years.</p><p>The contract manufacturer experienced contamination problems at its plant in Baltimore, which resulted in the destruction of key ingredients that would have amounted to roughly 400 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from J&amp;J and AstraZeneca PLC, according to a recent congressional committee report.</p><p>The manufacturing problems initially limited the supply of J&amp;J's vaccine after U.S. regulators authorized its use in early 2021. AstraZeneca's vaccine hasn't been authorized for use in the U.S.</p><p>In April, J&amp;J said it was withdrawing its prior forecast of sales of its Covid-19 vaccine for 2022, citing a global surplus of doses and uncertain demand.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com and Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Says It Plans to End Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Deal With Emergent BioSolutions</p>",
