  "title": "J&J Overcomes Another Bid to Block Possible Talc Bankruptcy; Judge says ‘mere speculation' can't keep J&J from isolating talc liabilities in new corporate entity",
  "text": "<p>Injury claimants had sought to prohibit J&amp;J from placing talc liabilities into a new corporate entity, which they said is the likely first step toward moving the pending talc-related claims into bankruptcy.</p><p>More than \"mere speculation\" of a possible future transaction is needed to justify restraining J&amp;J, Judge Porto said.</p><p>J&amp;J lawyer Jessica Lauria said the judge's ruling \"confirms that the plaintiff lawyers' efforts were based on nothing more than a false narrative and were wholly unsupported by any legal authority.\" J&amp;J continues to defend the safety of its products in the court system, she added.</p><p>Andy Birchfield, an injury lawyer pressing talc lawsuits against J&amp;J, said that despite the court ruling, scrutiny of the company's potential bankruptcy strategy will benefit talc claimants.</p><p>\"I believe what we're seeing is that J&amp;J is under the microscope and will no longer be able to do something underhanded without the courts or Congress stepping in,\" Mr. Birchfield said. \"While the judge ruled against our motion to stop them now, he also seemed to be saying to J&amp;J, ‘I'll be watching.'\"</p><p>J&amp;J has said in settlement talks it is considering funneling talc liabilities to a new corporate entity that could file for chapter 11 protection, using a Texas statute that allows for such transactions, known as divisive or divisional mergers, The Wall Street Journal reported in July.</p><p>Injury claimants have sought to pre-empt a chapter 11 filing, saying that could pressure them to settle with J&amp;J for less than their claims are worth in the tort system.</p><p>Last month, Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington Del. also declined to block J&amp;J from potentially transferring talc-related liabilities via a divisional merger. Injury claimants had alleged J&amp;J's plans would harm the interests of the company's former talc supplier Imerys Talc America Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in 2019.</p><p>As of July, J&amp;J faced roughly 34,600 lawsuits linking its talc-based powder to ovarian cancer, asbestos cancer and other illnesses. J&amp;J has denied talc causes ovarian cancer and has said tests over decades haven't shown the presence of asbestos.</p><p>J&amp;J hasn't disclosed any strategy for the talc lawsuits other than to defend the safety of its products in pending cases. It also hasn't denied that a divisive merger for its talc liabilities is a possibility, Judge Silverstein said last month.</p><p>Lawyers for J&amp;J said in the New Jersey court last week the company is \"exploring lawful transactions\" and \"considering a restructuring plan\" without specifying what that could entail, according to Monday's ruling.</p><p>A number of businesses contending with asbestos-related litigation, including Trane Technologies PLC and Georgia-Pacific LLC, have used divisional mergers in recent years to move asbestos liabilities into corporate entities that then filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at Alexander.Saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
