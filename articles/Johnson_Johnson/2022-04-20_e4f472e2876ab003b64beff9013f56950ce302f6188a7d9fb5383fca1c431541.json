  "title": "Stocks Advance Broadly as Earnings Roll In",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 advanced 70.52 points, or 1.6%, to 4462.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 499.51 points, or 1.5%, to 34911.20. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 287.30 points, or 2.2%, to 13619.66. It was the best day in a month for all three indexes.</p><p>The gains were broad-based, with 10 of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors advancing. Only the energy group, the top-performing sector this year, declined.</p><p>Companies have been showing they can deliver earnings growth even as investors worry about tightening monetary policy, said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones.</p><p>\"Any signs that we're seeing corporate America able to navigate through that environment and still grow profits is a very, very positive driver for equities over the balance of the year,\" he said.</p><p>Travel stocks were among the day's strong performers after a federal judge threw out the requirement that travelers in the U.S. wear masks on airplanes and other forms of mass transit. American Airlines Group shares rose $1.05, or 5.7%, to $19.59. Las Vegas Sands shares gained $1.59, or 4.3%, to $38.24. Carnival shares added 87 cents, or 4.6%, to $19.91.</p><p>The market is in the thick of earnings season with dozens of big U.S. companies expected to report this week.</p><p>Given high inflation, investors are watching for signs of which firms can preserve their profits by passing higher costs along to customers through price increases.</p><p>Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson gained $5.42, or 3.1%, to $183.08 after the pharmaceutical firm beat earnings expectations. Travelers fell $9.06, or 4.9%, to $176.16 despite reporting higher earnings and lifting its dividend.</p><p>Netflix shares fell as much as 26% in after-hours trading as the streaming company said it lost subscribers globally in the first quarter and expects to lose more this spring.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note kept climbing. The yield on the benchmark bond rose to 2.911%, the highest settlement since December 2018, from 2.861% on Monday.</p><p>Bond yields rise as prices fall, and investors have been selling bonds on expectations of high inflation and interest-rate increases from the Fed.</p><p>\"Fixed income has been a particular point of pain. This is the worst bear market in bonds we've seen in a generation,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds.</p><p>Concerns about inflation, which has soared to multidecade highs, and how central banks might respond have dominated investors' thinking for months, but so far corporate profits have held up as firms have largely managed to pass higher costs on to consumers.</p><p>Investors say they are expecting earnings growth to moderate this quarter as it becomes harder for companies to continue raising prices.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 5.2% to $107.25 a barrel. Natural gas fell 8.2%, continuing a volatile stretch for the fuel. Gold prices declined 1.4%.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.8%. Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.2% and the Shanhai Composite was down 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.5%.</p>",
