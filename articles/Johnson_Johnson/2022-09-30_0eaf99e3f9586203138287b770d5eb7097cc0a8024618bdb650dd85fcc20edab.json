  "text": "<p>J&amp;J created a new corporation, assigned it the liabilities from the talc litigation and none of the assets, and then the new entity declared bankruptcy. If this is allowed, corporations will have a blueprint for avoiding liability and leaving those awarded damages fighting for crumbs.</p><p>As to evidence, the federal multidistrict litigation (MDL) court has ruled that the science supporting the association of talc use and ovarian cancer is credible and should be considered by juries. As stated at the Third Circuit hearing, the false altruism of J&amp;J in seeking bankruptcy protection doesn't mean the company is seeking to pay more money, more quickly through bankruptcy, but instead, the exact opposite.</p><p>It is ironic that the editorial quotes Neil Katyal, retained by J&amp;J at an hourly rate exceeding $2,300, complaining of the cost of defending these claims. Plaintiff lawyers will get paid only when J&amp;J pays for its wrongdoing. Right now, the only attorneys making millions in this case are those defending outrageous tactics designed to avoid corporate responsibility while women who are the victims continue dying.</p><p>Prof. Erwin Chemerinsky</p><p>Dean, University of California, Berkeley School of Law</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Must Be Held Accountable</p>",
