  "text": "<p>   There are 15 different places to get a Covid-19 vaccine in Louisiana's Vernon Parish. Most locations have plenty of shots, and residents can even stop by the fairgrounds for one of the pop-up vaccine clinics. </p><p>   The only thing lacking is customers, said Rick Allen, mayor of Leesville, the parish seat. It isn't access, or availability, or a lack of transportation or education that is keeping the vaccination rate in the area to roughly 12%, he said. </p><p>   \"It's a lack of trust,\" said Mr. Allen. \"The only thing that will overcome that is time.\" </p><p>   Nearly 40% of the U.S. adult population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. But the pace of vaccinations has slowed to an average 2.5 million shots a day, down from 3.2 million earlier in April. </p><p>   Late last week, officials in Arkansas said they wouldn't order more vaccine for the coming week, noting there was enough already in the state. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo opened all state-run vaccination sites to walk-ins last month, citing a drop in appointments. In California, a mass-vaccination site at Dodger Stadium will close by the end of May so that vaccine efforts can shift to other sites, officials said Friday. </p><p>   As demand wanes, states, municipalities and healthcare providers are trying everything from one-on-one education in nontraditional locations to incentives including a free drink and cash. </p><p>   West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said recently the state would offer a $100 savings bond to residents aged 16 to 35 who receive a vaccination. The state had been an early leader in vaccinations. </p><p>   In Detroit, $50 prepaid debit cards are being offered to drivers who take a city resident for a shot. In Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont rolled out a campaign where some restaurants will give a free drink to anyone who shows a vaccination card. </p><p>    Stella A. Safo, an HIV primary-care physician and assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said some patients, including many older patients, want to see her or have a conversation to get her signoff that the vaccine won't interfere with medications, before getting a shot. </p><p>   For some other patients, the conversation on vaccine acceptance can get political. And for others, it is fixed in their mind that they will wait six or nine months to get the shot. </p><p>   \"Some people are just going to be waiting,\" said Dr. Safo. </p><p>   Everyone who was desperate for a vaccine has gotten a shot, said Alexandra Simon, the California director of vaccines for Curative, a Covid-19 testing and health-services company administering vaccines across the country. </p><p>   The company is now seeing people with access issues, including questions about insurance or identification, and fears about being unable to take care of children because of side effects. Many people, she said, simply can't take time off. Others only want an appointment on Thursday or Friday, or prefer a site with the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, said Curative's chief information officer, Isaac Turner. </p><p>   After hitting a plateau in their vaccination efforts, workers for Urban Health Plan, a network of federally qualified health centers in New York City, are coordinating directly with employers at the city's Hunts Point Terminal Market, going to the site to vaccinate dozens of workers at a time. One company wants to set up a vaccine clinic from 3 a.m. to 11 a.m. to catch truckers at the produce market, said Javiera Rivera, Urban Health Plan's incident command manager for Covid-19 response. </p><p>   In New York's Adirondacks region, clinics around Hamilton County have had unused doses at day's end, said William Farber, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors. </p><p>   Mr. Farber said he and others have now acknowledged there is some portion of the population that only wants the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, while Pfizer's shot is the only one authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for those aged 16 and 17. The county is now working with the state to increase access to those vaccines. </p><p>   This week, officials plan vaccination clinics at schools to capture teens aged 16 and up and hopefully some parents, too. The county is also set for a vaccination tent in a grocery store parking lot. </p><p>   \"We're trying to cater to what we think the demand is,\" said Mr. Farber. </p><p></p>",
