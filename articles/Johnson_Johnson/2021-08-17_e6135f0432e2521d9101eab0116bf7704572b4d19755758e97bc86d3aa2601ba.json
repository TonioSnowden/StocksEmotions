  "text": "<p>Senior Biden administration health and medical officials have been discussing the possibility of calling for booster shots for weeks and are nearing agreement on the issue, said the people, who added that a final decision hasn't been made. A formal announcement could come as soon as later this week.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the Biden administration was preparing a booster shot strategy, and that the shots could be needed as soon as in the next few weeks for people who were first to be vaccinated.</p><p>Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, the companies behind a two-dose Covid-19 vaccine, are seeking clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to provide booster shots to the general public. If the FDA greenlights the shots, the first doses could be distributed in September, the people said, as the first Americans who were vaccinated reach the eight-month window.</p><p>Pfizer is furthest along in the regulatory approval process, so the initial booster shots could go to Americans who received that vaccine. Moderna Inc., which also produces a two-dose vaccine, has said it plans to ask regulators next month to authorize its booster shots. Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to release data about the efficacy of two doses of its single-shot vaccine later this month.</p><p>The question of whether additional shots are needed to protect people against Covid-19 has come into focus amid a surge of infections caused by the Delta variant. Although breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated people are rare, some data has indicated the immunity provided by the vaccines wanes over time.</p><p>Last week, Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and President Biden's chief medical adviser, said boosters were likely sometime in the future.</p><p>\"We're already starting to see indications in some sectors about a diminution over time, that's durability,\" Dr. Fauci said, adding that the administration was following data for different cohorts of the population. \"When it does get to a certain level, we will be prepared to give boosters to those people.\"</p><p>Just over half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Research shows that the authorized vaccines offer effective protection against symptomatic Covid-19 for at least six months. But the protection diminishes over time, leading some public-health experts and vaccine makers to believe that boosters are necessary to maintain protection. A growing body of evidence suggests the vaccines are less effective among people with weakened immune systems than among the general population.</p><p>The FDA last week authorized booster shots for immunocompromised people who had received a solid organ transplant or individuals who have been diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise. The CDC also recommended administering an additional dose of Pfizer's vaccine in moderately or severely immunocompromised people who are 12 years and older, or the vaccine from Moderna in the immunocompromised 18 years and older.</p>",
