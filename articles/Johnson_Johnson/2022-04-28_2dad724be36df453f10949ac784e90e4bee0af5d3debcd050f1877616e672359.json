  "title": "Is the Covid-19 Vaccine Safe for Kids Ages 5 and Younger? What to know after Moderna sought FDA authorization for its shot in children under 5",
  "text": "<p>A small percentage of children also might experience multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, a rare condition that can occur in children several weeks after a Covid-19 infection. Without diagnosis and treatment, this condition can lead to organ damage or even death.</p><p>Infected children can also pass the virus on to others, including those who are at risk of severe disease, such as the elderly or immunocompromised.</p><p>Here is what parents should know about Covid-19 vaccines and children.</p><p>Which children are eligible to get a Covid-19 vaccine?</p><p>In the U.S., children ages 5 and older are eligible to be vaccinated only with Pfizer Inc.'s and BioNTech SE's Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech shots for children under 5, but it delayed a decision to review more data.</p><p>The agency is also considering whether to authorize Moderna Inc.'s vaccine for use in children 6 months to 5 years, after a study found it safely generates strong immune responses in young children. The vaccines from Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson are currently authorized only for people 18 and older.</p><p>Moderna has asked the FDA to clear its vaccine for use in adolescents, but the agency delayed a decision to review the risk for an inflammatory heart condition. To support the application, Moderna said it has provided the FDA additional safety and efficacy data in the age group. Moderna also has started the process of seeking authorization for its vaccine in children ages 6 to 11.</p><p>What if my child is under 5 years old?</p><p>There is no authorized vaccine yet, but one could be coming soon, perhaps by summer.</p><p>On April 28, Moderna said it had asked the FDA to authorize its vaccine for kids 6 months to 5 years, after a study found the shot safely induced immune responses in the young age group.</p><p>Pfizer-BioNTech's application for authorization in the young children is also pending, though the FDA in February delayed a decision to wait for data evaluating whether a third dose of the shot was more effective. The agency took the delay because the drugmakers' two-dose regimen produced disappointing results in children between 2 and 5 years old.</p><p>How effective are the Covid-19 shots at preventing infection and illness in children?</p><p>For kids ages 5 to 11, Pfizer and BioNTech released data last fall showing the vaccine was 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19. The companies also said the vaccine was safe during testing.</p><p>For 12-to-18-year-olds, the vaccine was shown to be 93% effective against hospitalization with Covid-19, CDC researchers reported in the fall.</p><p>A study published by the CDC in March showed that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were protective against Covid-19-related emergency and urgent-care visits among children and adolescents.</p><p>\"The vaccine is very effective at protecting against serious disease, hospitalization and death,\" said Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious-disease physician at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.</p><p>Moderna said a new study found that its vaccine's efficacy against symptomatic infections was 43.7% in children ages 6 months to 2 years and 37.5% in children ages 2 to 5.</p><p>Do kids get the same vaccine dose as adults?</p><p>Children ages 5 to 11 get two shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 10 micrograms per shot, spaced three weeks apart. Those who are 12 and older also receive a two-dose regimen, though it is 30 micrograms per shotâ€”the same dosage as adults.</p><p>My child will turn 12 years old soon. Should I wait to get the larger, 30-microgram dose for my child?</p><p>Most pediatric and infectious-diseases experts say no.</p><p>A lower dose doesn't necessarily render the vaccine less effective, they say. The Covid-19 vaccine was safe and elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses in a mid- to late-stage trial of children ages 5 to 11, according to Pfizer.</p><p>The antibody responses in participants who got 10-microgram doses were comparable to those in a previous Pfizer-BioNTech study of people ages 16 to 25 who got the larger, 30-microgram doses.</p><p>If a child's 12th birthday falls between doses, the CDC says children should get the vaccine dosage based on their age on the day of vaccination for that particular dose. For instance, if a child turns 12 between doses, they should receive the larger, 30-microgram formulation for their second dose.</p><p>Does my vaccinated child need a booster shot?</p><p>The CDC recommends people 12 and older get a booster shot, while children 5 to 11 can currently get a third dose only if they are immunocompromised. If your child is under 18, they can only get a Pfizer-BioNTech booster, as the Moderna shots aren't authorized for people under 18.</p><p>One study published by the CDC showed that although vaccine effectiveness was lower during the Omicron wave and decreased with time since vaccination, a booster dose helped to restore that effectiveness among 16- and 17-year-olds.</p><p>If my child has already had Covid-19, should they still get vaccinated?</p><p>The CDC recommends vaccination even in those who have already had Covid-19. Research has shown that people who are vaccinated and have been infected are better protected than those who have only been infected.</p><p>\"Anyone who has had the disease should still be vaccinated because it will give you better antibody titers,\" said Dr. Tan, referring to the levels of antibodies detected in the blood.</p><p>Can kids safely get other vaccines the same day as a Covid-19 shot?</p><p>Yes, a Covid-19 vaccine can be given simultaneously with other vaccines, including flu and other routine vaccines, according to the CDC. If multiple vaccines are given at a single visit, each shot will be injected at a different spot. For example, one might be administered in the right arm and a second in the left.</p><p>Does the vaccine pose any risks to children?</p><p>Any vaccine comes with the risk of an adverse reaction, and the Covid-19 shots are no different, doctors and vaccine experts say.</p><p>So far, however, researchers haven't found evidence that the shots pose any additional or different risks to children versus adults. The most common side effects from the vaccine, according to the CDC, are flulike symptoms such as fever, muscle aches and chills. Many recipients also experience arm soreness or bruising after receiving the shot.</p><p>Experts advising the CDC have said there appears to be an association between the mRNA vaccines and an inflammatory heart condition called myocarditis in some younger people, including young adults, though the reports are rare. The CDC and other health authorities still recommend Covid-19 vaccination for those 12 and older, given the greater risk from Covid-19, which itself can cause myocarditis and other complications.</p><p>\"The potential myocarditis associated with the vaccine is a very, very rare complication,\" said Dr. Tan. \"Children who get Covid are at a much higher risk of potentially developing myocarditis than a child who is vaccinated.\"</p><p>The FDA flagged the risk of heart-inflammation conditions such as myocarditis in children ages 5 to 11 when it reviewed Pfizer-BioNTech data, but it said the overall benefits in preventing Covid-19 disease and hospitalizations would outweigh the risk of the heart conditions. No cases of myocarditis were found in the key study testing the drugmakers' hot in 5- to 11-year-olds.</p><p>In extremely rare cases, people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine have experienced severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis related to chemicals that help package the main ingredient in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.</p><p>Sabrina Siddiqui contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sarah Toy at sarah.toy@wsj.com</p><p>Is the Covid-19 Vaccine Safe for Kids Ages 5 and Younger?</p>",
