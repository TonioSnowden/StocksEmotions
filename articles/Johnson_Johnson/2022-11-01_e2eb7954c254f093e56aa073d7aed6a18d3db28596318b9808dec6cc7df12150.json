  "text": "<p>A tight labor market reading Tuesday morning added to worries the Fed will undertake more aggressive monetary tightening to cool down inflation.</p><p>The major averages turned lower after the latest numbers on job openings came in higher than expected. U.S. job openings jumped to 10.7 million in September, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.</p><p>Indexes have rebounded strongly in recent weeks, in part, due to growing hopes the Fed could begin easing its campaign of interest-rate rises into the end of the year. The Dow closed out October with its best monthly performance since 1976. It rose 14% during the month, while the S&amp;P 500 ended 8% higher.</p><p>The central bank is widely expected to announce another 0.75-percentage-point rate increase at the end of its two-day monetary policy meeting. Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell following the end of the meeting Wednesday could offer clues about whether the central bank will adjust its course on monetary policy.</p><p>Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, eased slightly ahead of the results of the Fed's meeting. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped to 4.048% on Tuesday from 4.074% on Monday.</p><p>Recent stock market gains are likely to be temporary as the lagging effect of global interest rate rises and high inflation begins to bite early next year, said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. Bets that the Fed would soon ease off from its rate rises drove a fleeting rally during the summer, and similar hopes were driving recent gains, he said.</p><p>\"We are in the phase where there is still hope that we can get through this mess, with all these very significant distortions, without too much painâ€”hope springs eternal,\" Mr. Redha said. \"The path to a recession can often look like a soft landing.\"</p><p>Investors also parsed the latest corporate earnings updates. Uber rose 15% after reporting that revenue climbed last quarter. Airbnb, Mondelez International, Prudential Financial and American International Group are due to report after markets close.</p><p>This earnings season has seen mixed results from America's largest corporations. Some sectors have fared better than feared amid the dual threats of rising interest rates and inflation. Technology firms have fared poorly however and are suffering under higher rates.</p><p>Elsewhere, shares of Abiomed soared about 50% after Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would buy the company.</p><p>Overseas, rumors swirled that China was considering relaxing its strict Covid-19 policies, which have crimped growth in the world's second-largest economy. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 5.2% while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.6% and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3%.</p><p>\"I think you can't ignore rumors like this because it is such a big theme that the market has been worrying about for so long,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>Optimism for a loosening of restrictions and rising Chinese demand also boosted oil prices. Brent crude oil gained 1.7% to $94.29 a barrel.</p><p>In Europe, indexes were also broadly higher. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.3%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Slip Ahead of Fed Meeting</p>",
