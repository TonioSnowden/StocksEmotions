  "title": "J&J Gets Court-Appointed Evaluator to Estimate Its Talc Liabilities; In victory for J&J and setback for injury claimants, bankruptcy judge retains independent expert to assess valuation of mass litigation linking Johnson & Johnson's talc-based baby powder to cancer",
  "text": "<p>The expert, lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, has mediated some of the largest product-liability cases in U.S. history, including the $20 billion settlement related to the BP PLC oil spill. Mr. Feinberg is slated to issue a report before Judge Kaplan rules on how much talc-injury claimants are owed.</p><p>LTL has said estimating the valuation of the lawsuits would move its chapter 11 case forward and foster settlement talks to help resolve the litigation. Judge Kaplan agreed, saying Thursday that Mr. Feinberg's report would aid settlement discussions and rejecting injury claimants' argument that an estimation proceeding would stall the case.</p><p>\"I have in life, both on and off the bench, aggressively proceeded down roads to nowhere. Usually because I hate asking for directions,\" Judge Kaplan said. \"I am not convinced that estimation is in fact a road to nowhere.\"</p><p>Judge Kaplan said that he wouldn't set a deadline for Mr. Feinberg to produce his report but that he anticipates he will receive the report \"before the weather starts getting cold.\"</p><p>In a letter submitted to the bankruptcy court, Mr. Feinberg said Judge Kaplan asked him to forecast and estimate \"the volume and value of current and future ovarian cancer and mesothelioma claims\" at issue in LTL's chapter 11 case.</p><p>Mr. Feinberg said that he would \"provide a full and fair opportunity for all interested parties, and their experts, to be part of this proposed process\" and that Judge Kaplan will ultimately decide whether to accept or reject the findings in his report.</p><p>J&amp;J created the LTL unit last year to carry the talc litigation into chapter 11, a move the company said would provide a better forum for equitably compensating injury claimants. In February, Judge Kaplan denied injury claimants' request to dismiss the bankruptcy case. That ruling is under review by a federal appeals court.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
