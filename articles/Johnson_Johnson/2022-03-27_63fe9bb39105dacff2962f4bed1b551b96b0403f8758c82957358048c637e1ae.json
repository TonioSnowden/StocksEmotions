  "title": "U.S. Bankruptcy System Faces Government Pushback Over New Corporate Tactics; Lawmakers and government officials are targeting efforts by some companies to use chapter 11 in ways that they say the bankruptcy code never intended",
  "text": "<p>The pushback stems in part from the continuing bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma LP, the OxyContin maker that filed for chapter 11 to resolve mass lawsuits alleging that the company and its owners, members of the Sackler family, helped fuel opioid addiction.</p><p>The Justice Department and some members of Congress have said the bankruptcy case was misused to benefit the Sacklers at the expense of people who became addicted, while a federal judge last year overturned Purdue's proposed settlement to provide the family with sweeping protection from civil opioid litigation.</p><p>Other companies, such as former Ann Taylor owner Ascena Group Inc., also tried to use bankruptcy to protect insiders from litigation over alleged corporate wrongdoing. Johnson &amp; Johnson has accessed the bankruptcy system to shield its profitable business assets from lawsuits alleging its talc-based baby products caused cancer.</p><p>For decades, corporations have been using chapter 11 to break burdensome contracts, shed unsustainable debt and resolve litigation. Now, lawyers are turning the same tools on a new class of legal adversaries, namely individual claimants who allege they were harmed by dangerous products or other corporate malfeasance, said Steven Rhodes, a former judge who oversaw the city of Detroit's bankruptcy.</p><p>In particular, the bankruptcy cases filed by Purdue and J&amp;J to protect themselves from opioid addiction and talc-related lawsuits have \"brought to light the injustice and unfairness of it,\" Mr. Rhodes said.</p><p>In addition to efforts to use bankruptcy as a shield for mass litigation, corporations also increasingly attempt to handpick their preferred bankruptcy venues and sometimes individual judges. Other companies pay bonuses to their executives shortly before entering bankruptcy, leaving little or nothing to their most low-ranking creditors and shareholders.</p><p>The government has taken note of these tactics and has been pushing back. Federal courts have recently overruled decisions by bankruptcy judges that approved multibillion-dollar restructuring deals, while Capitol Hill is taking a more aggressive posture on what some senators describe as bankruptcy abuse.</p><p>But legislation could take time to develop and would have difficulty advancing in a deadlocked Senate. Pointing out potential misuses of the chapter 11 process often falls to the U.S. Trustee Program, which has served as the Justice Department's watchdog of the bankruptcy system since the office was created in 1978.</p><p>The U.S. Trustee has been lodging objections and appeals in response to new efforts by companies and their advisers to push the limits of what chapter 11 enables them to do, according to the office's director. Clifford White, who has served as director since 2006, said companies and advisers \"have been testing the boundaries of the bankruptcy code. We think that there has been overreaching in how the bankruptcy code is used.\"</p><p>Some higher courts have agreed. In December, a federal judge in New York overturned a roughly $4.5 billion settlement in the Purdue case that would have shielded the Sackler family from civil legal liability tied to the opioid crisis.</p><p>The Sacklers had sought to have opioid-related claims against them eliminated as part of Purdue's chapter 11 case, despite the fact that family members themselves didn't file for bankruptcy and opioid victims and public officials didn't unanimously agree to provide the family with releases. The federal judge ruled that this provision, known as a nonconsensual third-party release, wasn't permitted under the bankruptcy code.</p><p>A government lawyer representing the U.S. Trustee Program said in its appeal of Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy plan that it \"irreparably harms both the public and countless individuals by extinguishing opioid victims' direct causes of action against the Sacklers\" as well as the family's business associates.</p><p>An appeals court is reviewing Purdue's proposal to include the third-party releases in its bankruptcy settlement, after the Sackler family increased their proposed contribution to at least $5.5 billion.</p><p>Purdue has argued that releasing the Sacklers from liability is necessary to guarantee their financial contribution, which will fund anti-opioid programs nationwide. The Sackler settlement is widely supported by state attorneys general and groups representing opioid victims.</p><p>Following another objection from the U.S. Trustee, in January a federal judge in Virginia overruled a decision in the Ascena bankruptcy, saying the bankruptcy judge overstepped by wiping clean shareholders' rights to pursue legal claims against the former retailer. The federal court even took the unusual step of removing the bankruptcy judge from the chapter 11 case and assigning a different judge.</p><p>The U.S. Trustee also objected to the$2.7 billion settlement reached in the Boy Scouts of America bankruptcy case, arguing that the settlement would violate the Constitution by providing immunity to affiliated organizations that may share liability for sexual abuse, without providing due process to the rights of victims.</p><p>The Boy Scouts have argued that granting the third-party releases would help facilitate the bankruptcy's resolution, minimize costs and provide the best recovery to the sex-abuse victims.</p><p>Even profitable companies such as J&amp;J are pursuing chapter 11 filings to shed toxic baggage. J&amp;J generated $93.8 billion of sales in 2021, making $20.9 billion of earnings. As of the end of the year, the company had a market capitalization of roughly $450 billion and $14.5 billion of cash on its balance sheet.</p><p>J&amp;J, which is based in New Jersey, used a Texas law to shift the talc-related lawsuits it is facing to a subsidiary before converting it into a North Carolina-based entity called LTL Management LLC that then filed for chapter 11 in October. The company selected its preferred court in Charlotte, N.C., a popular landing spot for bankruptcies driven by mass asbestos litigation.</p><p>This type of venue selection, known as forum-shopping, has become more popular, according to legal researchers, as troubled businesses or nonprofits file for chapter 11 far from where they are based, seeking jurisdictions and sometimes individual judges they believe will treat them favorably.</p><p>Through its maneuver, J&amp;J separated itself from 38,000 pending talc lawsuits, potentially putting a cap on the company's liability. LTL set aside $2 billion for the lawsuits, less than half of the amount J&amp;J said it was close to agreeing to before the bankruptcy.</p><p>LTL's case was later moved to New Jersey, and a bankruptcy judge there endorsed the company's argument that the talc claimants were better positioned to receive payments in the chapter 11 process than in the tort system. He declined to throw out the bankruptcy case as plaintiffs' firms and the U.S. Trustee had requested.</p><p>A lawyer for LTL said that from the start of the bankruptcy case, the company \"has made clear its desire to immediately engage in mediation to reach a resolution that will be more fair to more claimants and provide equitable compensation in the shortest amount of time.\"</p><p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, (D, R.I.), said the decision to let the J&amp;J case proceed \"greenlights a maneuver to help big corporations on solid financial footing shirk responsibility for hurting Americans.\"</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is now preparing legislation that would restrict the ability of companies to shed their liabilities through chapter 11 by creating special subsidiaries and placing them in bankruptcy.</p><p>Proposed legislation to restrict bankruptcy venues to companies' principal place of business has also gained bipartisan backing in the Senate. House lawmakers from both parties also have proposed limiting the ability of companies to catch the last window before filing for bankruptcy to pay bonuses to their executives.</p><p>In the fiscal year ended September 2020, companies dispensed $165 million in executive retention bonuses in the five months before filing chapter 11, evading requirements for court approval and eating into the money available for creditors and other stakeholders, according to the Government Accountability Office.</p><p>During the flurry of chapter 11 cases triggered by the onset of pandemic in early 2020, many companies awarded bonuses to their executives just before filing for bankruptcy, in some cases shortly before terminating large numbers of employees. The U.S. Trustee Program has little recourse if a company pays out the bonuses before entering chapter 11, because of the way the bankruptcy code is written, Mr. White said.</p><p>Despite various bills being introduced in Congress and pressure from lobbying groups and activists, the bankruptcy code hasn't been overhauled since major legislation signed by President Bush in 2005. A set of recommendations released by the American Bankruptcy Institute in 2014 to overhaul the bankruptcy system and address perceived abuses hasn't been acted upon.</p><p>Jonathan Randles contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p>",
