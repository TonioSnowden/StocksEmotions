  "title": "Sanofi, Glaxo Seek Covid-19 Vaccine Approval in Crowded Market; Companies say shot's straightforward storage requirements could ease rollout in poorer countries",
  "text": "<p>Sanofi and Glaxo said Wednesday that their shot was 100% effective at preventing severe disease and 75% effective against moderate-to-severe illness. The shot was 57.9% effective at preventing any symptomatic disease, a result the companies said was in line with expected vaccine effectiveness in the current environment, where variants have blunted the protection afforded by shots. In a separate trial, the Sanofi-Glaxo shot was also shown to increase antibody levels by 18 to 30 times when given as a booster following a primary series of the already-authorized mRNA and adenovirus vaccines.</p><p>The companies said they were in discussions with various regulators, including the FDA and European Medicines Agency, about submitting the data to support an authorization.</p><p>Sanofi and Glaxo started work on their shot around the same time as front-runners such as Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford, which have since dominated vaccine rollouts globally. Sanofi and Glaxo fell behind when volunteers were accidentally given lower doses than intended in an early clinical trial.</p><p>That delay created greater challenges down the road. The companies ran their large Phase 3 trial after many countries started vaccine rollouts, making it more difficult to find volunteers who had been neither vaccinated nor previously infected. They were also testing their shot—based on the original strain identified in Wuhan, China—against variants like Delta and Omicron, which have blunted vaccines' effectiveness.</p><p>\"No other global Phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorized vaccines,\" said Thomas Triomphe, who leads Sanofi's vaccines unit.</p><p>The vaccine will join a crowded market where the bottleneck for low- and lower-middle income countries is no longer supply, but logistical challenges to getting shots into arms.</p><p>Sanofi and Glaxo say their vaccine has role to play because of its straightforward storage requirements—a feature that makes it easier to roll out in low- and middle-income nations. Unlike the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which need ultracold storage, the Sanofi-Glaxo shot can be stored at refrigerator temperature. The Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson shots have similar storage requirements to the Sanofi-Glaxo vaccine.</p><p>Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said that vaccines like the Sanofi-Glaxo and Novavax ones could \"potentially become the workhorse for vaccination in the future\" because of their less-demanding storage requirements and their lower cost. \"These are very important vaccines.\"</p><p>Another potential niche is for people who have been hesitant to embrace newer vaccine technologies. The vaccine uses the same platform that Sanofi has used in its flu shots. Glaxo's adjuvant—a substance that is used to stimulate a stronger immune response—is the same one it has used in some earlier vaccines.</p><p>Roger Connor, who leads Glaxo's vaccine unit, said there was a need for a variety of vaccines on the market.</p><p>\"We are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com</p><p>Sanofi, Glaxo Seek Covid-19 Vaccine Approval in Crowded Market</p>",
