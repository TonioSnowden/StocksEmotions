  "text": "<p>As of July, the healthcare company faced roughly 34,600 lawsuits linking its talc-based baby powder to ovarian cancer, asbestos cancer and other illnesses. In settlement talks, the company has said it could isolate its talc liabilities within a new corporate entity that could then file for bankruptcy, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.</p><p>Separating tort liabilities from corporate assets is possible under a Texas statute through what are known as divisional or divisive mergers. They have been used by several businesses facing large numbers of asbestos claims in recent years to silo those liabilities in newly formed units that were then placed in chapter 11.</p><p>J&amp;J hasn't disclosed any strategy for the talc lawsuits other than to defend the safety of its products in pending cases. The company also hasn't denied that a divisive merger for its talc liabilities is a possibility, Judge Silverstein said earlier this week.</p><p>Injury claimants said that would be a first step toward shifting talc liabilities into a bankruptcy proceeding, shielding J&amp;J from further jury trials. Talc claimants asked to restrain J&amp;J on the theory that its alleged strategy would harm the reorganization efforts of another company, Imerys Talc America Inc., which mined and supplied talc for J&amp;J for decades.</p><p>J&amp;J had challenged the request, saying that restraining the company as the claimants requested would hijack its corporate governance based on hypothetical harm and speculation.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com and Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Injury Claimants Fail to Prevent Potential Talc Bankruptcy</p>",
