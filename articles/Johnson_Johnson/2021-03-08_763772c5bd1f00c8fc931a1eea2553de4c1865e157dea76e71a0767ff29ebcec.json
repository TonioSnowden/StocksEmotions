  "text": "<p>Only Chile's entrepreneurial President Sebastian Pinera seems to have anticipated the high global demand for the first vaccines. He signed contracts to secure supply for his country early. The rest of the region came late to the game.</p><p>At the end of January, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, Mexico's undersecretary for prevention and health, rebuffed Moderna's offer to sign a contract for delivery of its vaccine. Last week Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was practically begging President Biden to share U.S. vaccine supplies with Mexico.</p><p>Private clinics and companies in Brazil may purchase only the Pfizer vaccine since it is the only one that has been fully approved by the regulator, Anvisa. High global demand for the Pfizer vaccine means most Brazilians have no option other than waiting for the government -- which also administers the emergency-approved Chinese and Oxford/AstraZeneca shots -- to give them the jab.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's breakthrough may mitigate supply problems in the months to come, but most countries are likely to continue to face difficulties with distribution because they have weak public-health systems. The prohibition against the importation and sale of vaccine by businesses means that the market is barred from helping people get vaccinated on their own.</p><p>It never seems to occur to the ideologically pure that the poor and working classes do not benefit from a free vaccine that is not available.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky explained to Bloomberg last week that his company's Covid-vaccine platform has been \"used before in areas like Ebola and HIV.\" By applying \"new data from the spike protein,\" scientists came up with a safe, effective single-shot solution. The company could deliver 100 million doses in the U.S. by June, though there may be some early manufacturing hiccups. Merck has announced that it will work with Johnson &amp; Johnson to boost production. Mr. Biden said last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine for all American adults by the end of May.</p><p>The Johnson &amp; Johnson single shot is more practical for many countries than the Pfizer and Moderna products because it's more affordable, doesn't require the deep freeze, and can be produced more rapidly. Widespread inoculation will be easier to pull off in places like Ecuador, Peru, Brazil and Mexico. But for optimal results the \"experts\" have to drop the politics and open markets.</p><p>Guayaquil, Ecuador, was hard hit by the virus in the spring of 2020, making it one of the world's direst hot spots. Yet the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were not approved for purchase by private Ecuadorean enterprises, such as pharmacies, until the end of February. That was more than two months after they were approved by the FDA.</p><p>Worse, Ecuador prohibits pharmacies from selling vaccines. So even if they import them, they cannot accept reimbursement from companies that want to buy in bulk to vaccinate their employees or from people who want to pay for their own jabs.</p><p>The logic is that someone who is able to pay should not get ahead of someone who is not able to pay. Yet allowing those willing to pay for themselves and for employees would remove from the government some of the financial and logistical burden of immunizing the nation. The government could concentrate its efforts on the neediest.</p><p>The country would also move toward wider immunity faster. This is important because like the rest of the region Ecuador is in a race against mutation risks. Instead, through March 1 Ecuador had managed fewer than 900 first doses a day. That no money officially has changed hands is hardly consolation for a vulnerable population.</p><p>Peru has relied almost exclusively on China for supply, and President Francisco Sagasti opposes private initiatives. Businesses that want to contribute toward vaccinating the population by importing vaccines on their own and inoculating employees have been told no. Meanwhile politicians and bureaucrats have jumped the queue.</p><p>Last week a Brazilian truckers' union won an injunction against the government's decision to impound vaccines that the union was trying to import. The ruling offers hope -- and for more than those \"elite\" truck drivers.</p><p>Demand for salable vaccine would create more supply, and a small tax could even be applied to generate funds for distribution to the poor. If the goal is ending the pandemic, promoting competition, risk-taking, and -- yes -- profitability is smart. It's the only way to accelerate inoculation rates.</p><p>---</p><p>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com</p>",
