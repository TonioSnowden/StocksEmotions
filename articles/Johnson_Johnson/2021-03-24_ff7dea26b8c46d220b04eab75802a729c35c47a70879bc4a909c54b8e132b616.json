  "text": "<p>   Paula Pimentel held her only grandchild, Ben, now a year old, for the first time last week. </p><p>   Two weeks after receiving her second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, Ms. Pimentel flew from Phoenix to Boston, woke the next morning in her daughter's apartment and cradled Ben, named after her father, in her arms. That afternoon, she took him out in his stroller and fed him. At bedtime, after she read him \"Goodnight Moon,\" Ben reached out to her and gave her a kiss. </p><p>   \"Oh my gosh. I melted,\" says Ms. Pimentel, 71, who had planned to be with her daughter, Rani Wise, when Ben was born in March 2020. That trip and three subsequent planned visits were scrapped because of the pandemic. </p><p>   Across the country, after a year apart, newly vaccinated grandparents are getting together with their grandchildren, celebrating missed birthdays, marveling at teenagers' growth spurts, delivering snacks to college freshmen. Many grandparents had been delaying trips until they got the vaccines and  new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which came out earlier this month. </p><p>   Those who have received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or a single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson and waited two weeks can gather privately without masks with others at low risk for Covid-19, the guidelines say. More than 42% of the U.S. population 65 and older is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. </p><p>   Caution remains. While the vaccines offer protection against serious illness from Covid-19 and appear to reduce chances of transmission, some newly vaccinated grandparents still wear masks in their children's homes and offer fist bumps rather than hugs. Many take rapid Covid-19 tests before making long-delayed road trips, to put family members at ease. </p><p>   \"You need to deal with the comfort level of your children,\" says Fred Goldenberg, a 69-year-old financial consultant in Traverse City, Mich. He and his wife, Debbie, went a year without seeing his children and nine grandchildren, who live in Chicago and Georgia, and planned a road trip to visit them as soon as they hit two weeks after their full vaccines. </p><p>   His adult children, though eager to see them, were still concerned their parents could potentially spread infection while asymptomatic, so the couple took a rapid Covid-19 test before making the five-hour drive to Chicago. They stayed with their daughter, 39, who was comfortable with them not wearing masks inside the house, and wore masks when visiting their 42-year-old son, who has small children and was more apprehensive. </p><p>   The 6-year-old grandson wore his mask while reading to his grandparents. The 4-year-old kissed them with his mask on. At dinner, Mr. Goldenberg and his wife sat at one end of the table, distanced from the family. \"We didn't have a problem doing that. We wanted to see our grandchildren. That's all that mattered,\" says Mr. Goldenberg. \"It was an emotional reunion.\" </p><p>   Mr. Goldenberg said he didn't realize how much the separation had affected him. Once vaccinated, he says, \"It felt like the weight of the world got less.\" </p><p>   His son told him, \"If I knew it would be a year before I got to hug you again, it would have been a bigger hug.\" </p><p>   Grandchildren, too, have been counting the days until their grandparents were fully vaccinated. </p><p>   When Jack Gianikos heard that his grandparents were getting the vaccine, he texted them to ask if he could soon come for a weekend visit. \"I'm really close to them,\" says the seventh-grader, who lives in Park Ridge, Ill. Before the pandemic, he would see his grandparents, Nick and Maureen Gianikos, once or twice a month. </p><p>   A few weekends ago, his grandparents, fully vaccinated, drove to Park Ridge and took Jack back to their Merrillville, Ind., home. \"He's probably grown 4 inches since we saw him last,\" says Mr. Gianikos. They wore masks in the car and out in public but took them off in the house. They watched movies from different couches and love seats. Mr. Gianikos says for now he's sticking to fist bumps rather than hugs. \"The vaccine doesn't relieve us from being cautious,\" he says. </p><p>   Some vaccinated grandparents are still waiting to see their grandchildren. </p><p>   Donne Davis, 74, of Menlo Park, Calif., hasn't seen her 6-year-old granddaughter, Sophia, who lives in Burbank, for 13 months. \"I haven't wanted to fly, and Southern California has been a hot spot,\" says Ms. Davis, who started an online social network for grandmothers called GaGa Sisterhood. She hopes to make it to Sophia's 7th birthday on June 5. </p><p>   \"I miss hugging her,\" says Sophia, a first-grader. </p><p>   In Boston, Rani Wise was worried that her son, Ben, would cry when he met his grandmother for the first time. Instead, he sat on her lap and listened while she read to him. They spent the day together, giving Ms. Wise and her husband, Tom, time to work. </p><p>   \"He wasn't crying for us,\" says Ms. Wise, founder of Rani Wise Consulting, a service for women entrepreneurs and small nonprofits. \"It was as if he already knew her, which he did in a way.\" </p><p>   Every day since Ben was born in March 2020, Ms. Wise had FaceTimed with her mother, carrying her cellphone around the apartment so her mother could see Ben. Though 2,600 miles away, he grew accustomed to Ms. Pimentel's face and voice. </p><p>   Ms. Pimentel missed Ben's birth but was there for his first birthday on Tuesday. They celebrated with balloons, hats and a Curious George birthday cake. \"I keep pinching myself,\" says Ms. Pimentel. \"I am so relieved that I'm here.\" </p><p></p>",
