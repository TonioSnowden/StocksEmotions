  "text": "<p>The US will donate millions of excess doses of Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile to countries around the world in an attempt to help battle fresh outbreaks of the pandemic.</p> <p>The Biden administration had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3455a8e6-d232-4d5e-a0e1-140db03c8dcc\">previously promised</a> to donate 80m doses, and on Thursday outlined how the first 25m of those would be allocated. South America, Africa, and south and south-east Asia will all receive millions of doses under the plans.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the US president, said in a statement: “The United States will be the world's arsenal of vaccines in our shared fight against this virus. In the days to come, as we draw on the experience of distributing the vaccine doses announced today, we will have more details to provide about how future doses will be shared.”</p> <p>Under the administration's plans, 19m vaccine doses will be distributed via the Covax programme backed by the World Health Organization. The Covax scheme has promised to deliver 2bn doses around the world by the end of the year, but has been hit by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63fbbb79-f657-4e6c-b190-cffd0d630593\">the decision</a> by the Serum Institute of India to stop exporting amid the country's devastating second wave of infections.</p> <p>About 6m of the US-manufactured doses will go to South and Central America, 7m to Asia and 5m to Africa. A further 6m will go to US neighbours and allies, including&#xa0;Mexico, Canada and South Korea. The doses will come from the US federal government's stockpile of authorised vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p> <p>The US has conducted one of the fastest vaccination programmes in the world, delivering 367m doses to states and administering at least one dose to just over 50 per cent of its population.</p> <p><a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases\">Figures from</a> the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the number of cases in the country continues to drop fast even though states are loosening their pandemic restrictions. The current seven-day average of new daily cases is just over 15,000, down 30 per cent from last week, while deaths have fallen 16 per cent in the same time.</p> <p>There are signs that as the cases fall, demand for vaccinations is dropping too. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/\">Data from Bloomberg</a> show that the daily vaccination rate in the US has fallen from 3.4m in April to just under 1m now.</p> <p>As case numbers fall and the stockpile of spare vaccine doses grows, the US has come under pressure to donate more jabs to countries struggling to get enough supplies, and those experiencing severe waves of infection.</p> <p>One of the first regions to receive US-made vaccines will be south Asia, where India and Nepal have both experienced devastating surges in recent months, with India reporting nearly 400,000 new cases a day at the peak a month ago. </p> <p>South and Central America will also be prioritised, where cases are rising in several countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Colombia.</p> <p>Some scientists believe, however, that exporting US-made vaccine doses will not be enough to quell the global pandemic, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9408223f-0a6c-43b7-9f67-c7e4697005c2\">have urged</a> the Biden administration to force US vaccine makers to open up their technology to companies around the world.</p> <p>Carrie Teicher, director of programmes at Médecins Sans Frontières in the US, said on Thursday: “The government must also demand that pharmaceutical corporations that received public funding to develop Covid-19 vaccines transfer the information and technology needed for other manufacturers to help scale up.”</p><p>Source: Kiran Stacey in Washington 2021 'US unveils plan to donate millions of Covid vaccine doses globally' FT.com 3 June.
