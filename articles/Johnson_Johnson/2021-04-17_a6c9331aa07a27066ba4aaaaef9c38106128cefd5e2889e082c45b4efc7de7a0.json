  "text": "<p>U.S. health authorities this week recommended a pause in vaccinations using J&amp;J's single-dose vaccine while they investigated six cases of a rare blood clot, combined with low blood-platelet counts, in women who had received the J&amp;J vaccine. One of the women died.</p><p>The pause is expected to remain in place at least until a federal vaccine-advisory committee meets April 23 to review the matter.</p><p>Authorities in several countries have restricted use of J&amp;J's vaccine, and a shot from AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford that uses a similar technology, after receiving reports of people getting blood clots following vaccinations.</p>",
