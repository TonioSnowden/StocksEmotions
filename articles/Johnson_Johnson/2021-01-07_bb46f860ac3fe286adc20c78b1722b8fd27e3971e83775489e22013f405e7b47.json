  "title": "U.S. News: A Variant Is Found Responsive To Vaccine",
  "text": "<p>South African researchers are racing to determine whether it makes patients more seriously ill than other variants of the virus. They are also testing how it responds to antibodies from people who have recovered from Covid-19 and those who have received coronavirus vaccines.</p><p>Their official conclusions are eagerly awaited by researchers around the globe, since one of the variant's mutations has in earlier laboratory experiments shown increased resistance to some of the antibodies the body uses to fight off Covid-19. U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this week that he was \"incredibly worried about the South African variant.\"</p><p>But scientists who worked on the antibody experiments and the lead investigators of several vaccine trials being conducted in South Africa say that -- based on their understanding of the virus and the immune response triggered by the shots -- the immunizations should still work against the new variant, although perhaps not as effectively.</p><p>\"The immune response is a complex part of our body and we know that immune response isn't just about neutralizing antibodies,\" said Glenda Gray, the head of the South African Medical Research Council and one of the lead investigators of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine trial in the country.</p><p>Covid-19 vaccines are designed to trigger an immune response that includes antibodies that shouldn't be affected by the new mutations as well as blood cells, known as T-cells, which attack the virus more broadly.</p><p>The two vaccines already approved in the U.S. have shown to protect more than 90% of the people who get them from Covid-19 symptoms. The immunization developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca PLC, which has been approved in the U.K. and India, was 62% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in trials in the U.K. and Brazil.</p><p>\"There might be some attenuation on the effectiveness of the vaccines,\" said Shabir Madhi, the lead investigator of the South African trials of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the one being developed by Novavax Inc.</p><p>A spokeswoman for BioNTech said the company expects to release results from its own tests on the South African variant later this week, but generally isn't concerned about the new mutations. A spokesman for the University of Oxford said they were still working on tests on the new variant. Moderna has said it is confident its vaccine will be effective at inducing neutralizing antibodies against new variants of the virus.</p><p>New daily cases recorded in South Africa, a country of 60 million people, reached a record of 21,832 on Wednesday. Nearly a third of all Covid-19 testsare coming back positive, suggesting that the real number of infections is much higher.</p>",
