  "title": "Kellogg Splitting Into Three Companies as It Shifts Focus to Global Snacks; Food company plans to create separate cereal, snack and plant-based food companies",
  "text": "<p>\"Bigness for bigness' sake doesn't make a lot of strategic sense,\" said Kellogg Chief Executive Steve Cahillane, who will head the $11.4 billion snacking business, which accounted for 80% of Kellogg's net sales last year.</p><p>Kellogg said it expects to complete the split by the end of 2023, with the North America cereal business possibly separating first, followed by its plant-based foods business as the third company. Kellogg said it also is considering selling the plant-based foods unit, which is predominantly comprised of the Morningstar Farms brand. It has yet to name the individual companies.</p><p>Kellogg's stock price rose about 3% Tuesday morning. Shares were already up 4.8% this year as of Friday, bucking the broader market slump.</p><p>The planned Kellogg breakup follows high-profile company splits announced last year by General Electric Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. In the food sector, Kraft Foods orchestrated a similar split about 10 years ago, spinning off its North American grocery business to focus on its faster-growing snack brands including Oreos and Triscuits, a business it named Mondelez International Inc.</p><p>The smaller company, which kept the Kraft name and products such as its macaroni and cheese, later merged with H.J. Heinz Co. to form Kraft Heinz Co.</p><p>The largest of Kellogg's three planned companies would be the global snacking business, which would include brands such as Pringles and Cheez-Its, and breakfast items, including Eggo waffles and Pop-Tarts. It also would include Kellogg's international operations, including a rapidly growing noodle business in Africa and cereal sales overseas.</p><p>\"The snacking business will have all household names with just the right level of scale,\" Mr. Cahillane said in an interview. \"And when you don't have the 'conglomerate effect,' you can get a lot more done.\"</p><p>Kellogg's North American cereal business, which had estimated 2021 net sales of $2.4 billion, will house its brands such as Special K and Raisin Bran. That planned company, Kellogg said, is expected to have stable sales over time and would focus on restoring profit margins after recent supply-chain disruptions.</p><p>Mr. Cahillane said Kellogg's North America cereal business will be better able to improve its profitability as a stand-alone company. The business has struggled for years with consumers moving away from breakfast cereals, and Kellogg's operations more recently were disrupted by a strike among factory workers and a fire at one plant that knocked out production and cost the company market share.</p><p>\"Frosted Flakes doesn't have to compete with Pringles for resources,\" Mr. Cahillane said. \"Economists might say we can do that without splitting. But we don't live in a textbook, we live in the real world.\"</p><p>The plant-based foods business, with estimated 2021 net sales of $340 million, will focus on capitalizing on category growth, first in North America and eventually on a global basis, Kellogg said.</p><p>Kellogg said the North American cereal and plant-based foods businesses would both remain based in Battle Creek, Mich. The global snacking business would be based in Chicago, with dual campuses in Battle Creek and Chicago.</p><p>The spinoffs are intended to result in tax-free distributions of shares in the North American cereal company and plant-based food company to current shareholders, according to the company. Capital structures and dividend payments, which Kellogg expects will be competitive with similar companies, will be announced later.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>Kellogg Splitting Into Three Companies as It Shifts Focus to Global Snacks</p>",
