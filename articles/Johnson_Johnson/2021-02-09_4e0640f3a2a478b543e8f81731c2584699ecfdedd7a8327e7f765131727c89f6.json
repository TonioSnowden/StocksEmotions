  "title": "World News:  WHO Backs AstraZeneca Vaccine  ---  Officials say efficacy  against severe cases  could clear agent for  emergency use soon  ----  By Gabriele Steinhauser in Johannesburg and Jenny Strasburg in London",
  "text": "<p>   World Health Organization officials expressed confidence that AstraZeneca PLC's Covid-19 vaccine can prevent severe cases of the disease, as well as hospitalizations and deaths, despite questions about the protection it offers against a fast-spreading strain of the virus first detected in South Africa. </p><p>   The remarks followed a release of information over the weekend about a small clinical trial of the vaccine in South Africa, which prompted the government there to halt a planned rollout of the shot. </p><p>   The preliminary data, which hasn't been published in detail, suggested the vaccine may not prevent mild and moderate cases of Covid-19 from a new variant that has become the dominant version of the virus in South Africa and the broader southern African region. </p><p>   The WHO's director-general, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said the trial's findings were \"clearly concerning news,\" but stressed that they came with \"important caveats.\" </p><p>   Those included the small number of volunteers in the trial -- around 2,000 -- and their relatively young median age of just 31 years. WHO officials and outside researchers said the trial was too small and its volunteers too young to draw clear conclusions about the vaccine's efficacy against the variant, known as B.1.351, especially when it comes to preventing more severe cases of Covid-19. Younger people tend to suffer from milder versions of Covid-19 and experience severe cases less often. </p><p>   \"Looking at the evidence on the AstraZeneca vaccine, across a number of trials, it is very clear that [the AstraZeneca vaccine] has efficacy against severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths,\" said Katherine O'Brien, director of the WHO's immunization program. </p><p>   Dr. O'Brien and other senior WHO officials suggested that the body would list the AstraZeneca vaccine -- seen as a cornerstone in the world's fight against the pandemic thanks to its low cost, high-volume target and easy storage -- for emergency use this week. </p><p>   \"There was a very positive view about proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in settings where variants are circulating,\" she said. The South African strain has been detected in at least 32 countries, including the U.S. </p><p>   Emergency-use listing from the WHO would serve as a recommendation for a range of countries, particularly poorer ones, to move forward with adopting the vaccine, speeding its path to widespread use around the globe. </p><p>   It would also allow for the first shipment of some 340 million doses of the vaccine from the WHO-supported Covax facility to poor countries, including several in southern Africa where the B.1.351 variant has driven powerful waves of infections in recent weeks. </p><p>   \"It is vastly too early to . . . be dismissing this vaccine,\" said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Norway-based nonprofit Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding Covid-19 vaccines. \"This is a very important part of the global response to the current pandemic.\" </p><p>   Recent trials of other Covid-19 vaccines in South Africa, including for shots developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax Inc., also found lower efficacy rates against the new variant, compared with predecessor versions of the virus. That has prompted vaccine makers to begin working on new shots to better target emerging coronavirus strains. </p><p>   Large-scale human trials for Covid-19 vaccines already in use, such as the ones developed by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc., were largely completed before more contagious newer versions of the virus came to drive infections in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Drugmakers say new vaccines will be ready in coming months, and updated shots could come to serve as annual boosters, altered based on emerging characteristics of the virus. </p><p>   Many countries' hopes are riding on the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford. AstraZeneca has promised to deliver more doses this year -- roughly three billion -- than any other vaccine maker. The partners said last week they hope to have an updated version of the vaccine, targeted at new variants such as the South African one, ready by autumn. </p><p>   South Africa said it would speed up the deployment of the J&amp;J and Pfizer vaccines until it has more data about the AstraZeneca shot's effect on severe illness. Other countries in the southern African region, such as Zambia, Malawi or Mozambique, have fewer options. They are almost entirely dependent on free AstraZeneca doses from the Covax facility. </p><p></p>",
