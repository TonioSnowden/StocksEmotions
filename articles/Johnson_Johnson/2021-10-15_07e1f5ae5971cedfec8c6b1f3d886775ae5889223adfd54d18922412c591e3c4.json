  "title": "J&J Covid-19 Booster Shot Under Discussion by FDA Advisers; Expert panel is reviewing data for Johnson & Johnson's application for authorization of a second dose of the company's Covid-19 vaccine",
  "text": "<p>The committee members, meeting virtually online, also will consider whether it would be better for people to wait at least six months after the first dose to get a J&amp;J booster shot. J&amp;J has presented evidence showing varying effects when the booster is given between two and six months after the first dose.</p><p>The meeting is the latest by experts whose counsel the FDA has sought before making authorization decisions.</p><p>After authorizing boosters for seniors and certain high-risk people who got the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, the FDA is now considering whether to clear extra doses of the shots from J&amp;J and Moderna Inc. The vaccine advisory committee voted unanimously Thursday to recommend Moderna's proposed boosters shot, and an FDA decision is pending.</p><p>The FDA also is weighing whether people who first get one vaccine should get booster shots of a different vaccine. The vaccine advisory committee will discuss a study of that approach at the meeting. Preliminary data from a federal study released Wednesday suggest that people who originally got the J&amp;J vaccine would get a stronger immune response from a booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, rather than another J&amp;J dose.</p><p>The Biden administration has been pushing boosters largelyto counter any waning strength of vaccines and the contagious Delta variant. But many health experts have said there isn't sufficient evidence to offer boosters to most people, beyond those who have weakened immune systems due to their age or medical condition.</p><p>J&amp;J's vaccine has been given as a single shot since it was authorized for use in the U.S. in late February, in contrast to the two-dose vaccine regimens from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.</p><p>A large international clinical trial found that a single shot of J&amp;J's vaccine was about 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. J&amp;J said the vaccine has been 75% effective globally against severe and critical cases.</p><p>The company said there was no waning of protection against severe cases in the U.S. up to at least six months after vaccination with a single dose. Yet it said it has observed a decrease in protection against moderate to severe Covid-19 cases globally due to the emergence of coronavirus variants outside the U.S.</p><p>J&amp;J studied giving a second dose at varying time points. In one large study of more than 31,000 people, J&amp;J found that giving a second shot about two months after the first was about 75% effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid cases, and was 100% effective against severe cases only.</p><p>In another, much smaller analysis involving only 17 study subjects, J&amp;J found that providing a booster dose six months after the first dose was able to boost levels of neutralizing antibodies against the virus to well above pre-booster levels.</p><p>J&amp;J said in its request for FDA authorization that it recommends a booster dose six months after the first dose, but said the booster could be given as soon as two months after the first. It isn't clear whether the FDA would limit use of the J&amp;J booster to older adults and other high-risk groups as it did with Pfizer's booster, and as the committee has recommended for Moderna's booster.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Covid-19 Booster Shot Under Discussion by FDA Advisers</p>",
