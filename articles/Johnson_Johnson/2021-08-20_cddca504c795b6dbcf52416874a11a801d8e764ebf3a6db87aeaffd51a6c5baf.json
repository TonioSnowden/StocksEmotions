  "text": "<p>By most measures, Johnson &amp; Johnson boss Alex Gorsky is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7483426f-dd8b-4ca5-a307-5ce1a1f604fd\">going out</a> on a high. He became CEO of the consumer health conglomerate on April 26, 2012. This week J&amp;J announced he will step down in January and become executive chair. Joaquin Duato, a company veteran and Gorsky's longtime protégé, takes up the reins.</p> <p>Under Gorsky's tenure, J&amp;J underwent massive growth and became a major player in the rare disease space, notably through the $30bn acquisition of Actelion. The company's pharmaceutical business grew from $24bn in sales in 2011 to over $45bn in 2020, thanks in large part to blockbuster cancer treatments Darzalex and Imbruvica.&#xa0;Since Gorsky took over the share price has nearly tripled and its market capitalisation now tops $470bn.</p> <p>Yet Gorsky also presided over some of the biggest crises in the company's 135-year history. These include claims that the company fuelled <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/statement-on-opioid-resolution\">the opioid epidemic</a> and allegations of asbestos in its <a href=\"https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/e2a329b4-aeb6-438d-a449-f0e282cf8ee0\">talcum baby powder</a>. The company has incurred $9bn of costs over the past two years from lawsuits related to these claims. Most recently, it agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e4297c0-e76a-49a3-bdf5-0c49375f00bb\">contribute $5bn</a> over nine years to help settle lawsuits related to the opioid crisis.&#xa0;</p> <p>The issues, shrugged off by investors, are far from resolved and will continue to dog Duato when he formally takes over. </p> <p>Overall though, J&amp;J's overall business is in rude health. The company raised its full-year guidance last month as its medical devices unit recovered from the pandemic-related sales slump. </p> <p>Things are also looking up on the vaccine front. The company <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/positive-new-data-for-johnson-johnson-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-on-activity-against-delta-variant-and-long-lasting-durability-of-response\">said</a> new data showed its single shot vaccine to be highly effective against the fast-spreading Delta variant.&#xa0;That should prove a useful boost after production problems and concerns over reported blood clots weighed on J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine. </p> <p>J&amp;J shares trade on a multiple of 18 times forward earnings, well above Pfizer's 12 times and Bristol-Myers Squibb's 9 times. Duato will have to deliver on the vaccine front to justify this premium.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers is published twice weekly.
