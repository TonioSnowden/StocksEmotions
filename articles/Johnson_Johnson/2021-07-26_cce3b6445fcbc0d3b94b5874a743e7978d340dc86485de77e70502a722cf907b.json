  "text": "<p>Their absences will diminish the men's golf at the Olympics, with two of the best in the world suddenly out of the mix because they tested positive. Rahm is the No. 1 golfer in the world, while DeChambeau is No. 6.</p><p>Rahm's result is particularly stunning because if the result is confirmed it would mean he was reinfected with the virus, contracting it twice in a short timespan despite having received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p><p>It was just a couple of months ago that Rahm tested positive in a surreal scene in the middle of the Memorial Tournament. He had just finished the third round with a six stroke lead, and he almost certainly would have cruised to victory and a payday of nearly $1.7 million. But as he walked off the course, officials informed him of the positive result -- a scene captured on camera as his face made clear the agony of the virus ripping away the victory from him.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, Covid is a reality in this world,\" Rahm later said.</p><p>That viral moment was punctuated by his incredible return to action in June, when he won the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines for his first career major.</p><p>In the days leading up to the Memorial, Rahm had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination, which is a one-dose regimen, but the vaccines can take two weeks to realize their full effects.</p><p>The back-to-back results for Rahm and DeChambeau indicate how virus-related woes are still a factor here as more athletes fly in. USA Golf said DeChambeau's positive came back as part of the final testing protocol before departing. It is not known if DeChambeau had been vaccinated. The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee said at the start of the games that 83% of American athletes had received the vaccine.</p><p>\"I am deeply disappointed not to be able to compete in the Olympics for Team USA,\" DeChambeau said in a statement. Patrick Reed, a 2016 Olympian, will replace DeChambeau for the Americans.</p>",
