  "title": "WHO urges world leaders not to have knee-jerk reaction to new coronavirus variant from South Africa as UK and EU impose travel bans",
  "text": "<p>The variant, named B.1.1.529 for now, will be discussed by WHO experts at a meeting scheduled for Friday to assess whether it is more highly transmissible or more dangerous than previous variants and whether to assign it a name based on the Greek alphabet.</p><p>See: South African scientists detect new coronavirus variant amid spike in cases</p><p>But the U.K. and European Union were taking no chances and immediately announced bans on travelers from South Africa and other countries in southern Africa, while others, including Japan said travelers would be forced to quarantine at government-run accommodation for 10 days to allow for regular testing, as the Associated Press reported.</p><p>Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO head of emergencies, stressed the importance of waiting to see what the data says.</p><p>“We've seen in the past, the minute there's any kind of mention of any kind of variation and everyone is closing borders and restricting travel. It's really important that we remain open, and stay focused,” Ryan said before the EU announcement.</p><p>https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1464006046586974211Analysts at Evercore said the strain is likely to be named nu, if the WHO determines it merits being named. It appears to have become dominant in South Africa, where it is accounting for 90% of cases in Gauteng, the smallest province in the country, with more than 1,000 cases a day being estimated.</p><p>The strain “(may have evolved in an immune compromised patient) has 32 mutations in the spike protein (including some in the RBD) and is reportedly the “most distant” (i.e. mutated) from the original strain yet,” Evercore analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a note to clients. “It has RBD and NTD mutations associated with resistance to neutralizing antibodies, and has potentially enhanced transmission.”&#xa0;</p><p>Others backed Ryan in emphasizing not enough is known yet and noting that South Africa is a leader in sequencing, an important benefit to understanding more about how it works. As South Africa has a very low vaccination rate, the strain has had plenty of opportunity to spread there.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said the U.S. is rushing to gather data, but that no decision on travel bans had been made yet.</p><p>“That's certainly something you think about and get prepared to do,” he told CNN. “You're prepared to do everything you need to protect the American public. But you want to make sure there's a basis for doing that.”</p><p>Evercore offered a link to a Twitter thread from Bloom Lab, which specializes in researching viruses, in which experts said it may have more implications for certain antibody treatments that were already struggling with other variants. For now, it appears that the cocktail developed by AstraZeneca AZNUK:AZN and antibody treatment developed by Vir Biotechnology VIR and GlaxoSmithKline GSKUK:GSK, may hold up better, they said.</p><p>https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1464005676842184705?s=11The news comes at a bad time for Europe, which the WHO said this week was again the only region where cases are rising on a weekly basis. WHO's Europe director, Dr. Hans Kluge, warned that without urgent measures, the continent could see another 700,000 deaths by the spring, boosting the total to 2.2 million. The U.S. State Department promptly warned Americans against travel to Germany or Denmark.</p><p>The U.S., meanwhile, is still averaging more than 1,000 COVID deaths a day, according to a New York Times tracker, and cases and hospitalizations are rising again. As the vast majority of all three are unvaccinated people, it makes it more important than ever that those people get their shots and avoid dying a preventable death.</p><p>See now: German air force to move ICU patients as COVID cases rise</p><p>In medical news, Merck MRK and partner&#xa0;Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said their COVID-19 antiviral molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate COVID to 6.8% from 9.7% in the placebo group in the latest update of data from its study dubbed MOVe-OUT. That is equal to an absolute risk reduction of 3.0% and a relative risk reduction of 30%.</p><p>An earlier analysis of the data showed it reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50%. The e companies have shared this latest data with the Food and Drug Administration, which is currently reviewing the data for a possible emergency use authorization for the treatment.</p><p>The European Union drugs regulator authorized Pfizer PFE and BioNTech's BNTX vaccine for use on children aged from 5 to 11 years, clearing the way for shots to be administered to millions of elementary school children on the continent amid a new wave of infections sweeping across Europe, the AP reported. It is the first time the European Medicines Agency has cleared a COVID-19 vaccine for use in young children.</p><p>Most people originally vaccinated with J&amp;J's JNJ shot are choosing other vaccines if they get a booster, new government data show, partly reflecting concerns about the&#xa0;lower effectiveness of the drugmaker's vaccine, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>Latest tallies</p><p>The global tally for the coronavirus-borne illness climbed above 260.2 million on Friday, while the death toll edged above 5.18 million, according to&#xa0;data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>The U.S. continues to lead the world with a total of 48.1 million cases and 775,797 deaths.&#xa0;</p><p>India is second by cases after the U.S. at 34.6 million and has suffered 467,468 deaths. Brazil has second highest death toll at 613,642 and 22 million cases. I</p><p>n Europe, Russia has the most fatalities at 265,134 deaths, followed by the U.K. at 144,876.</p><p>China,&#xa0;where the virus was first discovered late in 2019,&#xa0;has had 111,081 confirmed cases and 4,809 deaths, according to its official numbers, which are widely held to be massively understated.</p>",
