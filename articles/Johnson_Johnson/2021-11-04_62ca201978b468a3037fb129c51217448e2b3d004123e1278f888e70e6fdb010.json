  "title": "Moderna Cuts Covid-19 Vaccine Sales Forecast for 2021; Company's third-quarter earnings fell short of estimates as it ramps up for booster shots",
  "text": "<p>The Cambridge, Mass.-based pharmaceutical firm has expanded rapidly over the last 18 months as it developed and brought to market one of the first effective vaccines against the pandemic disease. The pharma company said it sold 208 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine in the latest quarter.</p><p>Its quarterly revenue through September of $4.97 billion fueled a $3.33 billion profit, or earnings of $7.70 a share. Those metrics soared above last year's third-quarter levels, before Moderna's Covid-19 shot had been approved, when revenue was $157 million and the company recorded a $233 million loss.</p><p>But the latest results fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had predicted sales of $6.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $9.09 a share.</p><p>Through Wednesday, Moderna's stock price had more than tripled in value this year.</p><p>In the U.S., more than 70 million people have received Moderna's two-dose Covid-19 vaccination. That accounts for about 36% of the Americans who are considered fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. Another 6.1 million Moderna shots have been used as boosters in the U.S.</p><p>More recently, Moderna's efforts to roll out vaccines for young people have fallen behind the pace of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech S.E., the makers of the most-used shot in the U.S. Moderna has asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize its vaccine for use in 12- to 17-year-olds, but the decision has been delayed as the agency evaluates whether the shots raise the risk of a rare inflammatory heart condition in young men.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine has already been authorized for use in children as young as 5.</p><p>Moderna's quarterly sales rose 14% over the second quarter, continuing the company's ascent in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A year ago, its Covid-19 shot was still in clinical trials, it hadn't created any approved vaccines and quarterly revenue had never topped $160 million.</p><p>The company forecast that in 2022, sales could range from $17 billion to $22 billion. Moderna said it has already signed advanced-purchase orders worth $17 billion for deliveries next year.</p><p>Vaccines remain in high demand in countries that are receiving initial supplies, and for booster shots for people already fully vaccinated. Last month, the FDA approved the use of a Moderna booster shot. Boosters from Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson have also been approved.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How will its success with the Covid-19 vaccine change the future for Moderna? Join the conversation below.</p><p>People who were initially vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine can get any booster at least six months after their second dose so long as they are seniors or at high risk because of underlying medical conditions or their workplace.</p><p>Moderna said that commercial sales of booster shots for the U.S. next fall could bring in $2 billion of revenue.</p><p>Flush with cash from vaccine sales, Moderna has been working to develop other vaccines and therapies. This week, it made an equity investment in Metagenomi, a privately held company that uses Crispr and other gene-editing tools to develop new drugs.</p><p>Moderna is also working on developing vaccines for the flu, the Zika virus and other diseases.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Moderna Cuts Covid-19 Vaccine Sales Forecast for 2021</p>",
