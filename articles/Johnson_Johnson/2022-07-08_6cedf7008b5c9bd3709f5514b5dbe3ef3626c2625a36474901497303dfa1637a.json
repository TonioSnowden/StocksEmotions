  "title": "Saint-Gobain Must Face Challenge to Asbestos Unit's Bankruptcy Case; A judge declined to dismiss allegations that a Saint-Gobain unit defrauded asbestos victims by pushing its tort liabilities into chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>A CertainTeed spokesman said it believes the allegations have no merit and will defend its position vigorously.</p><p>CertainTeed and several other large, profitable companies have used a Texas corporate law in recent years to move mass asbestos liabilities into bankruptcy, isolated within corporate subsidiaries that have no other business operation. Plaintiffs' lawyers have challenged the tactic, known as the Texas Two-Step, saying it lets companies access the protections of chapter 11 without placing business assets in a value-destroying bankruptcy.</p><p>Judge Whitley on Thursday declined to dismiss a challenge to CertainTeed's prebankruptcy reorganization, saying the allegations from plaintiffs' lawyers put forth a plausible claim for relief.</p><p>\"Whether they prove out is something else,\" the judge said from the bench on Thursday. \"Who knows at this juncture.\"</p><p>The ruling marks a procedural defeat for CertainTeed and its sister entity DBMP LLC, created under Texas law in 2019 to take on legacy liabilities arising from historical sales of asbestos products. DBMP then filed for chapter 11 in Charlotte, a popular landing spot for asbestos bankruptcies, while CertainTeed continues to run its business and pay other creditors in the ordinary course.</p><p>Plaintiffs' lawyers have complained that DBMP's creation as an asbestos vessel amounted to a fraudulent transfer because it cut off their access to corporate assets and subjected them alone among CertainTeed's creditors to the chapter 11 process. If successful, the legal challenge would unwind the Texas reorganization that created DBMP.</p><p>\"The court's ruling was another important recognition that the Texas Two-Step cannot override longstanding bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer laws,\" plaintiffs' lawyer Jon Ruckdeschel said.</p><p>CertainTeed has offered to cover any amounts due to asbestos claimants owed under a court-approved chapter 11 plan for DBMP. The company believes that such a compensation trust is the best and most efficient way to resolve roughly 60,000 pending asbestos claims, the spokesman said.</p><p>CertainTeed and its affiliates have argued that asbestos plaintiffs had no basis to sue because DBMP didn't transfer any of its property before its chapter 11 filing or orchestrate the division of assets and liabilities that created it.</p><p>The judge disagreed. If a business divides its assets from its liabilities ahead of a bankruptcy, and creditors can't sue for the resulting harm to their interests, \"the door is wide open to wholesale fraud,\" he said on Thursday.</p><p>Last year, Judge Whitley found that the decision to place DBMP in bankruptcy had been made before it was even created and \"was driven not by businesspeople, but by lawyers.\" The allocation of CertainTeed's asbestos liabilities to DBMP appears to have \"a material, negative effect on the asbestos creditors' ability to recover on their claims,\" according to that ruling.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, Georgia-Pacific LLC, and U.S. units of Ireland's Trane Technologies PLC have also placed subsidiaries laden with tort liabilities in chapter 11 using the Texas Two-Step. The companies, all advised by the same law firm, Jones Day, have enjoyed protection from civil litigation in state courts while the chapter 11 cases are pending.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
