  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson will restart shipments of its Covid-19 vaccine to Europe after the continent's health agency concluded&#xa0;the benefits outweighed the risks even after it identified a “possible link” between the jab and rare blood clots.&#xa0;</p> <p>The European Medicines Agency <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood\">said</a> on Tuesday that a rare combination of blood clots and low platelet count should be added to the list of side-effects from the J&amp;J jab. However, it added that the overall benefits of the single-shot vaccine exceeded the risks of these reactions.</p> <p>J&amp;J said it would resume shipment of 200m vaccine doses to the EU, Norway and Iceland and update its information on the diagnosis and management of the “very rare adverse event”.</p> <p>The European rollout of the J&amp;J vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1070ff2-a473-4f6a-a484-681fb8de4251\">delayed</a> last week after US health agencies recommended it be paused while they investigated the side-effects, which were seen in eight out of more than 7m people who received the jab. The US Centers for Disease Control&#xa0;and Prevention will meet on Friday to decide its next steps. </p> <p>Scientists have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42f57da1-577c-4685-952f-2630fb0fb01a\">racing </a>to determine the cause of the rare reaction, and the EMA said that it did not yet know the exact mechanism.</p> <p>Sabine Straus, chair of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (Prac), said it was “probably an immune response” similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin — called heparin induced thrombocytopenia — but that it was too early to know definitively.</p> <p>She added that the combination of blood clots and low platelets had “a strong association” with both J&amp;J and Oxford/AstraZeneca's adenovirus-based vaccines. The regulator is also assessing data from Russia's Sputnik vaccine, which uses similar technology. </p> <p>The EMA said individuals should seek urgent medical help if they experience symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain and leg swelling three weeks after vaccination with J&amp;J's jab.</p> <p>Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at J&amp;J, said: “We appreciate the rigorous review of the Prac and share the goal of raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of this very rare event.”</p> <p>“We strongly believe in the positive benefits of our single-shot, easily transportable Covid-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally,” he said.</p> <p>The EMA said that all cases of the rare side-effects occurred in people under 60 years old, mainly women, and three weeks after vaccination.</p> <p>“It's very rare and very difficult for healthcare professionals to recognise these cases,” Straus said, adding that spotting cases early can prevent complications.</p> <p>Sales of J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine hit $100m in the first three months of the year. The drugmaker does not sell its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine for profit. </p> <p>The production of J&amp;J's vaccine at a plant in Baltimore was halted on Monday by the US Food and Drug Administration while it investigates the site run by Emergent BioSolutions that has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3906ee0c-8062-496c-9bb7-d1814a30bdf3\">beset by manufacturing problems</a>. </p> <p>Also on Monday, the US House committee on oversight and reform <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/maloney-and-clyburn-launch-investigation-into-emergent-biosolutions-profits-and\">launched</a> a separate investigation into whether Emergent received contracts to manufacture vaccines “despite a long, documented history of inadequately trained staff and quality control issues”.</p> <p>Joaquin&#xa0;Duato, vice-chair of J&amp;J's executive committee, said that the FDA's assessment was expected to close this week and that J&amp;J remained committed to ensuring that all substances used in its vaccine “meets our high quality standard”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2021 'J&amp;J to restart vaccine shipments to Europe after regulatory green light' FT.com 20 April.
