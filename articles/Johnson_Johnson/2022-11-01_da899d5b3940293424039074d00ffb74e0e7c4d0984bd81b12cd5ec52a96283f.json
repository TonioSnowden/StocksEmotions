  "title": "J&J Agrees to Buy Medical-Device Maker Abiomed; All-cash deal would be valued at $16.6 billion upfront, including cash",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J expects to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>Abiomed sells Impella heart pumps for treatment of conditions including a heart attack, heart failure and clogged arteries.</p><p>J&amp;J, which sells prescription drugs and other health products, has been on the prowl for acquisitions this year under new CEO Joaquin Duato, who has said that beefing up the company's medical-device unit through deals was a top priority.</p><p>\"This acquisition is consistent with that strategy, expanding J&amp;J med tech into high-growth markets, and accelerating revenue growth while advancing the standard of care,\" Mr. Duato said.</p><p>J&amp;J, of New Brunswick, N.J., has been trying to increase sales growth of its medical-device unit, especially as it prepares to hive off its business selling Tylenol, Listerine and other consumer-health products.</p><p>The unit, which sells artificial knees, contact lenses and surgical products, had sales of $27.06 billion in 2021, up 18% from 2020. Sales had rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic. In previous years, however, the unit had moderate growth and sometimes sales declines.</p><p>Abiomed, of Danvers, Mass., is in one of the fastest-growing areas of the medical-device industry. The company's sales rose 22% last fiscal year ending March 31 to $1.03 billion.</p><p>Founded in 1981, Abiomed acquired the Impella pump with its purchase of Germany's Impella CardioSystems in 2005. The pump was introduced first in Europe, and then received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in 2008.</p><p>Abiomed bills Impella as the world's smallest heart pump. For many patients, it is placed in the heart via a catheter inserted into a leg artery, to temporarily assist the heart's pumping function while patients undergo other procedures to treat underlying cardiovascular disease.</p><p>It can also be implanted during surgery.</p><p>J&amp;J executives said they expect to further accelerate Impella sales by introducing it in more countries and expanding the approved uses for the pump.</p><p>The deal \"will enable us to leverage Johnson &amp; Johnson's global scale, commercial strength and clinical expertise to accelerate our mission of making heart recovery the global standard of care,\" Abiomed Chief Executive Michael Minogue said.</p><p>Mr. Minogue, who has led Abiomed since 2004, will retire upon the deal's closing. Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Greenfield will serve as president, J&amp;J said.</p><p>The Abiomed deal is J&amp;J's biggest since its $30 billion purchase of drugmaker Actelion in 2017. It is the company's biggest device deal since its $19.7 billion purchase of Synthes Inc. in 2012.</p><p>J&amp;J expects the acquisition will be neutral to or slightly reduce earnings in the first year, but then add 5 cents a share in 2024 and to add increasingly to earnings thereafter.</p><p>J&amp;J said it is using a combination of cash on hand and short-term financing for the Abiomed deal. The company held $11.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, plus $22.7 billion in marketable securities as of Oct. 2, according to a securities filing.</p><p>In addition to the upfront $380 per share, Abiomed shareholders will receive contingent value rights that could entitle them to receive up to $35 per share at later dates.</p><p>This includes $17.50 per share if sales of certain Abiomed products exceed $3.7 billion during the 12 months ending in the first quarter of 2028. Shareholders may also get $7.50 per share if the FDA clears additional uses for Impella, and $10 per share if Impella is recommended for certain uses in cardiology clinical guidelines.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Agrees to Buy Medical-Device Maker Abiomed</p>",
