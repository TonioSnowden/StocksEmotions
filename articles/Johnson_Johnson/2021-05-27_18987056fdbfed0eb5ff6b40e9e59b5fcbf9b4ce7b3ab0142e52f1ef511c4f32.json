  "text": "<p>German scientists investigating rare blood clots linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccines believe the problem lies with the adenovirus vectors that both vaccines use to deliver the genetic instructions for the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus into the body. An <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f76eb802-ec05-4461-9956-b250115d0577\">article</a> on May 27 failed to make clear the vaccines deliver DNA gene sequences of the spike protein which can then splice, and the researchers believe these genetic instructions can be modified to resolve the blood clot issue.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Correction: rare blood clots' FT.com 27 May.
