  "title": "World News: South Africa Sees Rise in Reinfections --- Research suggests previous illness provides less protection against Omicron strain",
  "text": "<p>South Africa's biggest private health insurer and other health experts estimate that about 70% of the country's 60 million citizens have had Covid-19 and hence some immunity against new infection. Omicron appears to be able to evade some of this immunity, giving it an advantage in a population with a high infection rate, the scientists said in a research paper, which hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>\"Previous infection used to protect against Delta, and now with Omicron it doesn't seem to be the case,\" said Prof. Anne von Gottberg, a clinical microbiologist at South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases, or NICD, and one of the authors of the paper.</p><p>Prof. von Gottberg said a past infection should still offer protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death. Vaccines also have fended off the worst of the disease caused by variants with some similar characteristics to Omicron, giving reasons for hope that they will do so in the case of the new variant.</p><p>South Africa, which has the largest known Omicron outbreak in the world, reported 11,535 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, up from 8,561 a day earlier, the NICD said. On Thursday, Nov. 25, 2,465 cases were identified. On Nov. 8, when the first Omicron case was detected, the authorities reported 116 cases.</p><p>The institute didn't note what variant caused the new infections, but scientists say Omicron is the dominant variant in South Africa. In an indication that large numbers of infections aren't being detected, the proportion of tests coming back positive increased to 22.4% from 16.5% on Wednesday.</p><p>South Africa uses vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>Omicron has been detected in more than 30 countries world-wide, with many of those cases linked to travel from southern Africa. In a minority of countries, including the U.S., U.K., Belgium and Germany, Omicron has been identified in people who aren't known to have had contact with travelers.</p><p>In Norway, more than 50 people who attended a company Christmas party in Oslo have tested positive for Covid-19 in what authorities said Thursday was a likely outbreak of the new variant.</p><p>At least one of those people is a confirmed Omicron case, the Oslo municipality said, citing genome sequencing from that patient. The remaining roughly 50 people who tested positive for Covid-19 are being investigated. All of the participants were required to be vaccinated and tested before attending, contact-tracing officials told state broadcaster NRK.</p><p>More than 70% of Norwegians are vaccinated. New rules announced Thursday were set to take effect at midnight, limiting gatherings to 100 people or less, banning the sale of alcohol to people standing at a bar, and requiring face masks in malls and on public transportation.</p><p>---</p><p>Bertrand Benoit contributed to this article.</p>",
