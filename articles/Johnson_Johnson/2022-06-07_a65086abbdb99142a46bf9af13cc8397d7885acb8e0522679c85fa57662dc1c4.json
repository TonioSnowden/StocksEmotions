  "title": "Novavax Covid-19 Vaccine Faces FDA Advisers' Scrutiny; Outside panel to recommend whether the shot should be authorized, after the agency found it effective but flagged a heart-safety concern",
  "text": "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would then decide whether to recommend the vaccine's use, before the shots would become widely available.</p><p>Novavax says the shot would appeal to people reluctant to receive the vaccines made by either Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or by Moderna Inc., which are each based on the relatively new gene-based technology known as messenger RNA.</p><p>Overall, however, the use of Covid-19 vaccines and boosters has slowed in the U.S., as many people eligible for the shots have received them and tire of getting additional doses. Roughly 67% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the CDC. Less than half the population has received one booster.</p><p>During its all-day meeting, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is considering clinical trial data from the company as well as the FDA staff's review.</p><p>Agency staff told the outside advisers that the shot was 90% effective against Covid-19 in its pivotal trial but noted six \"concerning\" cases of heart-inflammation conditions in vaccine recipients.</p><p>Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., pushed back on those concerns in its presentation, saying the myocarditis and pericarditis cases were consistent with what would be expected in the general population.</p><p>The outside advisers asked questions about combining the Novavax shot with mRNA vaccines already on the market, but the purpose of the meeting was to evaluate Novavax's benefit as a two-shot initial regimen.</p><p>\"I know there is intense interest in using this vaccine as a booster dose,\" said Dr. Doran Fink, an FDA official. \"We don't have the capacity to discuss that potential use today.\"</p><p>The pivotal trial for the Novavax vaccine took place before the Omicron variant emerged. Studies have found Omicron has been better able to elude authorized vaccines, but the impact on Novavax's hasn't been determined.</p><p>One advisory committee member encouraged testing to assess Novavax vaccine's efficacy against the variant.</p><p>The company's Covid-19 vaccine would be the first authorized in the U.S. with a traditional protein-based platform, used for decades to inoculate against diseases such as hepatitis B and shingles.</p><p>It sends a version of the coronavirus spike protein to stimulate the body's immune response. That is different from the market-dominating Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which deliver mRNA to instruct the body to assemble a harmless version of the coronavirus spike protein, which then triggers the immune system to mobilize defenses.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine uses a modified version of an adenovirus, the virus behind many common colds, to deliver genetic instructions to cells.</p><p>Novavax has said it regularly gets calls and emails from people awaiting its vaccine, and some experts have voiced hope that the shot could win over unvaccinated skeptics of mRNA technology.</p><p>Kayb Joseph, a 47-year-old Chattanooga, Tenn., resident, said she has checked every two weeks for news on Novavax's vaccine and would drive to the company's Maryland headquarters to get it if needed. She prefers its protein-based platform.</p><p>\"I just don't believe in being somebody's R&amp;D,\" she said. \"Novavax is still just the first version, but to me it is the second version of traditional technology.\"</p><p>Write to Liz Essley Whyte at liz.whyte@wsj.com</p><p>Novavax Covid-19 Vaccine Faces FDA Advisers' Scrutiny</p>",
